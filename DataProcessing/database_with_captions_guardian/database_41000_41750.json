        "content": "Peacekeeping and aid operations face disruption as outsiders are scapegoated in one of Africa\u2019s most vulnerable countries\nA backlash against foreigners in Central African Republic threatens to disrupt peacekeeping and aid supplies in one of Africa\u2019s most fragile countries.\nSince an Italian missionary was identified as CAR\u2019s first coronavirus case last month, xenophobia has been on the rise. Stories widely published in the country\u2019s newspapers and on social media have portrayed foreigners as unwelcome importers of a disease that could further impoverish the country.\nThousands of non-nationals are employed in CAR by UN agencies and aid organisations, which provide about 70% of the country\u2019s health services.\nThe UN has extended a curfew for employees due to \u201crecent incidents of verbal aggression and intimidation as well as risks of stigmatisation of UN staff, international NGOs and humanitarian actors\u201d, according to an internal memo.\nThe UN peacekeeping force has suspended most internal travel and stopped bringing in new contingents of \u201cblue helmets\u201d.\nAlarmist rhetoric in CAR\u2019s media is stoking animosity. One tabloid has accused Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration in France of using coronavirus \u201cto destabilise French-speaking African countries\u201d. Others described the arrival of the infected Italian as \u201cthe poisoning of an entire people\u201d and have raged about \u201ca genocide\u201d against Africans.\n\u201cThe spike in threats and violence against foreigners and humanitarian personnel, also spread by the media, pose significant safety and security risks that can result in reduced operations when they are needed the most,\u201d said the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) in a recent report. \u201cThe aid pipeline could face ruptures and stock-outs, depriving the most affected people from the only existing safety net.\u201d\nHumanitarian groups fear the impact of the pandemic in CAR could be disastrous. After years of sectarian violence, the country\u2019s health infrastructure is virtually nonexistent; rebel militias control three-quarters of its territory, and 600,000 people have been uprooted from their homes into overcrowded displacement camps.\nLess than a dozen coronavirus cases have so far been registered, although many more are suspected given the lack of testing equipment.\n\u201cPeople are very worried about this new disease,\u201d said Maaike Hersevoort, chief of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in CAR. \u201cThey associate foreigners with corona. If engagement is not done well then there could be an escalation.\u201d\nCAR\u2019s government has made moves to rein in the sensationalist coverage of coronavirus. On Wednesday, health minister Pierre Soms\u00e9 released a code of conduct for reporting on the outbreak responsiblyand asked for \u201crespect for human rights [and] solidarity, both nationally and internationally\u201d.\nThere are warnings that displaced people living in host communities could be denigrated as virus-spreading outsiders too, as could members of CAR\u2019s Muslim minority \u2013 long marginalised as \u201cArab foreigners\u201d.\nGrowing tensions could lead to fresh clashes. \u201cIncreased xenophobia against several segments of the population poses a high risk of resurgence of intercommunal violence and conflict,\u201d said Ocha.\nThere is widespread distrust in CAR of the French, the country\u2019s former colonial rulers, while regional neighbours Chad and Sudan have interfered with CAR\u2019s internal affairs for decades. More recently, Russian troops have arrived to shore up the beleaguered government, and the Chinese are active in the mineral industry.\nForeign aid workers face regular assaults, burglaries, carjackings and even murder. There were 300 incidents recorded last year. Public support for the UN mission, known by its French acronym Minusca, is already low following a sex abuse scandal and its failure to protect civilians. In recent months, an influential pressure group in CAR\u2019s capital, Bangui, has targeted Minusca with an aggressive smear campaign, calling the peacekeepers \u201cthe Minuscavirus\u201d.\n\u201cOther international organisations are paying the price for the UN mission\u2019s mistakes,\u201d said Fridolin Ngoulou, a Central African journalist. \u201cBut this should not be a reason to attack foreigners.\u201d\nThe challenges were brought into sharp relief by an incident last week, when paramedics in protective gear arrived to collect a member of Minusca\u2019s international staff in Bangui, who was showing symptoms of Covid-19, and had to face down a hostile crowd.\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s frustration,\u201d said Denise Brown, the humanitarian coordinatorin CAR. \u201cPeople\u2019s everyday lives are really difficult. They suffer from armed conflict, tuberculosis, horrible malaria, diarrhoea, and now all of a sudden there\u2019s something called the coronavirus that might arrive and infect lots of people \u2026 All of that contributes to tension. We need to understand that tension.\u201d",

        "content": "Medical staff say they are taking on double the patient loads, working twice their usual hours, and without the equipment they need\nInside New Jersey intensive care units and emergency rooms, frustrated and frightened frontline medical staff are taking on double their normal patient loads or working twice their usual hours, without the equipment they need.\nFrom moment to moment, they face harrowing life-and-death encounters and constantly risk their own safety to help an overwhelming number of people of a variety of ages and backgrounds who are \u201ceffectively drowning on dry land\u201d from Covid-19.\n\u201cEvery single 12-hour shift I work is like nothing I\u2019ve ever endured,\u201d said Lynn, a nurse at Pascack Valley Medical Center in Westwood, northern New Jersey. She has worked in the field for more than three decades, and describes the current state of the ICU as \u201ca war zone\u201d. The patients are \u201csicker than I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, she says. They can crash in the blink of an eye, then slip into multiple organ failure.\nLike many other medical professionals across the US, she does not want her full name published. She is afraid of retaliation from the hospital where she works for speaking out on the conditions inside her unit. But she said she feels beat up from working so hard, and is alarmed by the grim outcomes for her patients.\n\u201cWhat you see on TV you can pretty much times by ten,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nNew York is the US state worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak so far, but its neighbour, New Jersey, is not far behind. The state had more than 51,000 cases and 1,700 people had died as of Thursday afternoon, a stunning toll on a population of less than 9 million people.\nCoronavirus cases have been confirmed across New Jersey, but the north, where many New York city commuters live, has been particularly hard hit. That is especially true in Bergen county, which has seen the fourth-highest number of coronavirus deaths of any county in the US, according to Johns Hopkins, and is where Pascack Valley Medical Center is located.\nNew Jersey governor Phil Murphy has said he believes the state\u2019s curve for new coronavirus cases has begun to flatten. Even so, \u201cthe fatalities are going up, and sadly will continue to go up\u201d, he said Wednesday as he announced the deaths of New Jersey residents who were infected weeks ago.\nThough there are signs of hope, New Jersey hospitals are still currently struggling. On Thursday, more than 7,360 people were hospitalized in the state because of Covid-19, and healthcare workers on the frontlines said the vast majority of their patients now have the disease.\nThough hospital staff are coping to the best of their abilities, Lynn says just at her hospital alone, it would require hundreds more nurses as reinforcements to be able to deal properly with such dire need. Hackensack Meridian Health, which operates the Westwood facility, did not return repeated requests for a comment for this article.\nAn emergency room doctor in northern New Jersey, who also feared retaliation and asked to remain anonymous, said his hospital has a similar caseload to Elmhurst Hospital, one of the hardest hit in New York City.\nBefore the outbreak, it wasn\u2019t unusual if one patient lost their pulse and needed chest compressions to stay alive. But during a recent shift, he was faced with three such situations, back-to-back.\n\u201cFor whatever reason, folks are holding up, holding up, holding up, and then almost before your eyes over the course of minutes to an hour will suddenly decompensate in a way that few things that we deal with in the emergency room do,\u201d he said.\nHe describes how one 48-year-old patient\u2019s oxygen levels dropped catastrophically low. The doctor rushed in without full personal protective equipment (PPE) so he could insert a breathing tube into the man\u2019s airway, even as his patient was coughing up the virus.\nAn hour later, the doctor was on the phone with his patient\u2019s daughter to update her on her father\u2019s condition. He was grateful he had avoided a much more difficult call by making the choice he did, regardless of personal risk.\n\u201cThe choice is stop and put on all your PPE, which can take a minute or two, or get on the most important stuff, and get in there and save his life,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cNot to be dramatic about it, but that quite literally was the choice that I felt I was faced with.\u201d\nIn another case, a 400-pound man with Covid symptoms started throwing punches at hospital staff as his breathing began to fail. His carbon dioxide levels were too high, and he likely didn\u2019t know who he was or where he was, much less who other people around him were.\nThe doctor had no idea how he and other staff members would help the man without risking exposure to the disease themselves.\nHe said he thinks his hospital and New Jersey\u2019s state government are doing the best they can in the circumstances, but is frustrated with the federal government, and especially Donald Trump, for minimizing the disease\u2019s seriousness and creating what he believes are unrealistic expectations around available resources as well as how long this pandemic will last.\n\u201cAll of that as an emergency room doctor has made my work harder, not easier, and it\u2019s made it harder in ways that are very tangible,\u201d he said.\nHe describes walking into a shift weeks ago, when he quickly realized that within two hours of the president going on television and saying testing was readily available \u2013 even though it wasn\u2019t \u2013 somewhere between 40 and 60 patients had flooded into his emergency room looking for tests.\nTests haven\u2019t been the only tools in short supply. Lynn said she and her colleagues have been using the same face shields for up to a week, and they\u2019re out of bleach wipes to disinfect their once disposable equipment.\n\u201cThey\u2019re one time use, and up until a month ago, I would have been disciplined for using them more than once,\u201d Lynn said.\nJane, another registered nurse who works in the ICU at Pascack Valley Medical Center and asked to only use a nickname, wrote in an email to the Guardian that nurses are \u201ccovered head to toe in whatever PPE they can find\u201d, but there still isn\u2019t enough. Jane said she and her peers use one N95 mask per 12-hour shift, and they\u2019re putting the masks in paper bags to reuse even after they\u2019re assumed contaminated.\nAmid the scarcity, employees have started buying their own PPE, she said.\nJane described desolate hospital halls, juxtaposed with a \u201cchaotic\u201d ICU, where patient monitoring alarms blare, signaling another person\u2019s decline. She laments the lack of staff and hazard pay, doubled patient loads and risk of infection. But after her shift is done, what stays with her is how many young, relatively healthy people are dying. And dying alone, because their loved ones are not allowed to visit, for fear of spreading this invisible killer.\n\u201cI feel defeated,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI also feel helpless because we are working so hard, trying every treatment modality that we can, and patients are still dying.\n\u201cSometimes I cry driving home from work. I can\u2019t help but think about patients and their family members who weren\u2019t able to be with them or speak with them before they died.\u201d",

        "content": "Reykjanes peninsula\u2019s last active period started in 10th century and lasted 300 years\nVolcanic activity is escalating in a region of Iceland that has not erupted for 800 years, with scientists warning it could cause disruption for centuries to come.\nSince 21 January, the Reykjanes peninsula south-west of Iceland\u2019s capital, Reykjavik, has experienced more than 8,000 earthquakes and about 10cm of land uplift due to magma intrusions underground.\n\u201cIt seems that after being relatively inactive for many centuries, this region is waking up,\u201d said Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University.\nSituated close to the town of Grindav\u00edk and the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction, and only nine miles (15km) from Iceland\u2019s international airport, the region last erupted about 800 years ago (though there have been more recent eruptions offshore). Geological evidence shows the area is fed by five volcanic systems, which seem to come to life in a coordinated way roughly every 1,000 years.\nThe last period of volcanic activity on the peninsula began in the 10th century and continued until the 13th. Unlike typical Icelandic volcanoes, which tend to wake for a few years and then die down, when this region gets going it appears to splutter on and off for up to 300 years, producing eruptive episodes (locally known as \u201cfires\u201d) lasting a few decades. Long thin cracks known as fissures extend up to five miles (8km), producing fountains of lava, usually without large amounts of ash or explosive activity.\nThe most recent \u201cfires\u201d occurred between 1210 and 1240 and covered about 50 sq km of land in lava. At least six separate eruptions occurred, each lasting weeks to months, interspersed with gaps of up to 12 years with no activity. Volcanic rock fragments and particles were carried tens of kilometres by the wind and written sources report the rockfall causing problems for livestock in the area.\nIf a similar series of eruptions occurred today, the Iceland GeoSurvey calculates that runways at Keflav\u00edk airport could be coated in 2cm of ash, temporarily halting all flights.\n\u201cWind direction during times of ash production is critical \u2013 anything with a slight northerly aspect is going to cause problems for the international airport and the metropolitan area of Reykjav\u00edk,\u201d said McGarvie.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is if lava flows towards the town of Grindav\u00edk,\u201d said Krist\u00edn J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir from the Icelandic Meteorological Office. \u201cThere is also other important infrastructure in the vicinity including a geothermal power plant. Hot and cold water supply may be at risk, along with roads, including the road between Reykjav\u00edk and Keflav\u00edk airport.\u201d\nIcelanders are rarely fazed by volcanic activity, but they will be keeping a close eye on the Reykjanes peninsula. Because the eruptions are likely to be relatively small and occasional they will be easier to cope with than massive and sudden outpourings of lava like the 1783-84 Laki eruption, but if the pattern is indeed about to repeat, it will present a new kind of challenge for Icelanders.\n\u201cPeople on the Reykjanes peninsula, and their descendants for several generations, may have to be on their guard and ready to evacuate every so often,\u201d said McGarvie.",

        "content": "As we got closer to Gij\u00f3n, Sporting fans were throwing things at the train. It wasn\u2019t a great game but it was quite an experience\n\u201cGet a workman\u2019s helmet.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cBlue, if they\u2019ve got one.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t make a lot of sense \u2026 at least not until we got off the train a few days later. Turned out Jaime was right. When a small group of us said we were going to the Asturian derby between Sporting Gij\u00f3n and Real Oviedo, his response was to buy a hard hat. We hadn\u2019t and we were exposed.\nNot that we were the only ones. Not all of the thousand or so fans travelling there wore helmets but there might have been a couple of hundred when they arrived at the station in Oviedo that afternoon. In the mind\u2019s eye it is more, and a lot of them are covered with football stickers. Looking back, that derby might not even be a good thing, something to hang on to, still less to celebrate, but it doesn\u2019t go away.\nFirst, an apology: the headline in La Nueva Espa\u00f1a that morning called it the \u201cgreatest show on earth, more than a match\u201d, but in fact it wasn\u2019t much of a match at all, still less a great game, confirmation of what one report called a \u201ctendency to nil-nilism\u201d.\nWell, they did say favourite and this did come to mind, a memory crystallising in that piece of sartorial advice and the essential silliness of it all.\nThis was huge, friends in Oviedo had said. Rooting out the reports now says so too. The match preview opened with the line \u201cat last the day arrives\u201d.\nThat day was a Sunday in January 1997 and they loaded us \u2013 too many of us \u2013 on to a train to Gij\u00f3n, 35km away. A football special, no one else on board and no other way to go. Packed in and unable to move, glasses of piss passed along precariously and chucked out of the window. Songs hammered out on the ceiling and the sides, even if we didn\u2019t know all of the words.\nAs we got closer to Gij\u00f3n, some Sporting fans waited on the platforms of stations the train sped through \u2013 Veri\u00f1a and La Calzada at a guess, looking at the map 23 years later \u2013 and threw things, thudding against the side.\nIt pulled into Gij\u00f3n and the police boxed us in on all sides and ran us to the stadium all along the beachfront, three kilometres covered quickly. A few rocks flew, a bottle or two, hence the helmets, yet mostly it was insults and not much else \u2013 most tongue in cheek, accepted and reciprocated. They welcomed us and we proposed a swap deal for the UK: Gibraltar for Gij\u00f3n. They never did take us up on that.\nWe kept running, all the way to the Molin\u00f3n, where the mayor of Oviedo said the city\u2019s team played \u201cbeautifully\u201d. He insisted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t football, this is poetry.\u201d He was only half right, another politician telling porkies, and six years on Oviedo fans had more reason to hate him than anyone in Gij\u00f3n when he proposed to put the club out of business and they rose up to rescue it. Yet if anyone deserved anything that day it probably was Oviedo.\nManaged by Juanma Lillo, they had two goals disallowed and a penalty turned down in the 0-0 draw. Peter Dubovsky, rest his soul, hit the bar. Lillo wasn\u2019t happy about the ref but he doesn\u2019t linger in my mental version, which is more in line with the match ratings for the two keepers: \u201cAblanedo: not a game with much work.\u201d And \u201cMora: more relaxed than he could have imagined.\u201d In fact, the game almost doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 beating double-winning Atl\u00e9tico 4-1 that year, now that was a game \u2013 but nor does it matter. It was the experience, the discovery, the something.\nThe president of the principality admitted that there \u201chadn\u2019t been much football\u201d. It had, though, \u201cbeen a great party\u201d, and now there was a train to catch home.",

        "content": "The global sporting calendar may be empty, but games such as Fifa 20 and AO Tennis let you set up a cup competition in your living room \nEuro 2020 postponed, Wimbledon cancelled, baseball\u2019s opening day delayed: the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the sporting calendar. Fortunately, if you\u2019re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as Fifa 20 enable fans to create their own tournaments \u2013 providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition.\nOne of Fifa\u2019s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled.\nBest of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20\u2019s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final.\nThere\u2019s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although Co-op Seasons is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you\u2019re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard.\nThe best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won\u2019t threaten your double glazing is The Show\u2019s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It\u2019s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress.\nThe Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus.\nFor the first time since 1945, there will be no Wimbledon champion. In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren\u2019t officially licensed, the game\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d stadium and the \u201cLarge Gold 4\u201d and \u201cMedium Silver 17\u201d trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. \n  It\u2019s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there\u2019s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You\u2019re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more.\nIf you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it\u2019s portable so you can take it out into the garden.\nFive years after release, EA\u2019s most recent golfing effort enjoys a cult following \u2013 to the point that secondhand copies start at \u00a370. That\u2019s purely down to its offline excellence. While PGA\u2019s lack of online options disappointed, sofa-based play is of a pass-the-pad nature that immaculately apes the series\u2019 Mega Drive roots.\nUp to four players compete over 12 courses, the pick of which is Paracel Storm: a preposterous yet brilliant 18-hole round based on Battlefield 4. Stick-swinging controls suit players of all ages, but Sega alumni can make use of a classic three-tap technique if so preferred.\nIf you have trouble getting a copy, serious players might want to try The Golf Club 2019, which aims to be a very accurate simulation of the sport. More accessible alternatives include the long-running cartoon-style favourite Everybody\u2019s Golf (PS4) or the incredibly hectic Party Golf (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), currently just \u00a32 on Switch.\nVisual Concepts\u2019s basketball veteran goes one step beyond the other games listed. In addition to setting up offline tournaments, you can create online competitions too. Up to 35 friends can join you in playing out a real NBA season with six expansion teams, or a created one that mixes classic rosters with contemporary ones.\nIf you\u2019d rather stick to home-bound b-ball, the offline Playoffs mode is the way to go: a straight knockout tournament where up to 16 players can be user-controlled.

        "content": "The coronavirus has laid bare two societies divided on lines of class and race \u2013 a divide reflected in skewed death figures\nWhen Sean Petty walked into the emergency room of Jacobi medical center in the Bronx, at the start of his nursing shift on Monday, he was assailed by a catastrophic scene. About 60 people, almost all of them African Americans or Latinos from the surrounding area of New York City, all displaying classic symptoms of Covid-19, were gasping on stretchers everywhere he looked.\n\u201cEvery nook and cranny of the emergency department was full of patients attached to portable oxygen tanks, people so sick they needed beds. The stretchers filled the room and spilled down the corridors, 10 patients in just one hallway,\u201d he said.\nThe dreadful sounds of sickness filled the room. \u201cIt\u2019s like a chorus, a cacophony of coughing.\u201d\nPetty, a pediatric emergency nurse who now spends much of his time caring for adults with coronavirus, could not help envisaging the thousands of contagious micro-droplets being expelled into the air with all that coughing. \u201cI felt like I was walking into a cloud of poison,\u201d he said.\nPetty is on the frontline of the frontline: New York City. The metropolis has become the focus of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, just as in 2001 it became the focus of the worldwide al-Qaida terrorist threat on 9/11.\nDay by day, the statistics tell their own grim story. On Tuesday, the New York City death toll overtook that of 9/11 and now stands at 3,602 (2,753 died in the city in the 2001 terrorist attacks). On Wednesday, it was announced that New York had suffered its highest number of fatalities in a 24-hour period \u2013 806 lives snuffed out in just one day.\nEven that was almost certainly an undercount, as those New Yorkers who die at home are not being included in the figures.\nThe attack is coming in waves \u2013 not just on one sunny morning in September as when the Twin Towers came down, but over days and relentless weeks. There are Ground Zeros dotted throughout the city, like Jacobi, one of 11 major public hospitals that are all now pushed to, and beyond, the limit.\nAs the crisis thickens, a picture of how the virus is ravaging the city has come into view carrying with it a sobering realization. Coronavirus may not in itself discriminate, but its outcomes certainly do. It has inflicted its terrible toll not so much on New York City, but on the two cities it contains.\n\u201cCoronavirus has exposed New York\u2019s two societies,\u201d Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who acts as the official watchdog for New Yorkers, told the Guardian. \u201cOne society was able to run away to the Hamptons or work from home and have food delivered to their door; the other society was deemed \u2018essential workers\u2019 and made to go out to work with no protection.\u201d\nDifferent boroughs, even different neighborhoods within each borough, are experiencing coronavirus almost as though it were two different contagions. In wealthier white areas the residential streets are empty; parking spots that are fought over in normal times now stand vacant following an exodus to out-of-town weekend homes or Airbnbs.\nIn places like the Bronx \u2013 which is 84% black, Latino or mixed race \u2013 the sidewalks are still bustling with people making their way into work. There is still a rush hour. \u201cWe used to call them \u2018service workers\u2019,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow they are \u2018essential workers\u2019 and we have left them to fend for themselves.\u201d\nThe public advocate pointed out that 79% of New York\u2019s frontline workers \u2013 nurses, subway staff, sanitation workers, van drivers, grocery cashiers \u2013 are African American or Latino. While those city dwellers who have the luxury to do so are in lockdown in their homes, these communities have no choice but to put themselves in harm\u2019s way every day.\nIf you superimpose a map of where frontline workers live within New York over a map of the 76,876 confirmed cases in the city, the two are virtually identical. In Queens, the most intense concentration of Covid-19 infections are in precisely those neighborhoods with large numbers of essential workers.\nOne telling detail: at least 41 subway and bus workers have died from coronavirus. A diversity review by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 2016 found that 55% of its 72,000 employees were black or Latino, and 82% were male \u2013 which is also telling as more men than women are dying from the virus.\n\u201cWe put people out there and said you got to go to work, but we didn\u2019t give them protective gear or additional testing to keep them safe. It was almost as though these groups were expendable to keep the city moving,\u201d Williams said.\nThis week a tiger tested positive at Bronx Zoo. It generated plenty of headlines, but few media articles made the point that Williams highlighted.\n\u201cA tiger tests positive \u2013 that\u2019s good to know. If we have enough diagnostic test kits for tigers, shouldn\u2019t we have enough for our own frontline humans?\u201d\nTwo miles away from Bronx Zoo, back in the ER of the Jacobi medical center, Sean Petty sees the impact of New York\u2019s two societies every day. \u201cWe have almost 100% people of color in our emergency room,\u201d Petty said.\nMost of the adult Covid patients he cares for are also wrestling with underlying health conditions that make them far more vulnerable to the disease.\n\u201cOur patients are coming in with all of the comorbidities associated with poverty and racism \u2013 diabetes, asthma, hypertension. We have patients who are sicker and more likely to die because their lives have been conditioned by these chronic illnesses.\u201d\nReliable data has been hard to come by, as both city and state authorities resisted for several weeks releasing official figures on the grounds that the subject of disparities was less important than keeping hospitals afloat. Journalists at the independent not-for-profit news site THE CITY were driven to do their own analysis of NYC department of health data and found that in the Bronx people are dying at twice the rate of New Yorkers as a whole.\nOn Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio finally caved to pressure and posted preliminary findings that unambiguously underline the racial breakdown of coronavirus\u2019s deadly toll. Black and Latino New Yorkers are dying at double the rate of white and Asian New Yorkers, following precisely the public advocate\u2019s narrative of two societies.\n\u201cThere are clear inequalities, clear disparities in how this disease is affecting the people of our city,\u201d De Blasio said.\nIn recent days Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has tentatively suggested that the crisis may already have reached its apex and could be plateauing as the curves for new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions all show signs of flattening.\nIf there are indications that the city may be starting to prevail against the disease, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to Sean Petty. When he looks out of the window of the staff room during shift breaks he sees the refrigerated truck lined up to receive the bodies of Covid victims \u2013 one of 80 parked outside hospitals around the city.\n\u201cThere is no good news story here,\u201d he said.\nAlready Jacobi has lost two frontline health workers, an educator in the psychiatric department and a nurse\u2019s aide. On top of what he sees as preventable tragedies, Petty said what rattled him most was when a Jacobi emergency room resident aged 27 was admitted into intensive care.\n\u201cThat was a huge wake-up call for me. To see a 27-year-old person sent to ICU who was working a hundred yards from me, that shook me.\u201d\nPetty said he has never felt as angry towards the US healthcare system and towards government \u2013 the Trump administration as well as city and state leaders \u2013 for failing to protect the city\u2019s frontline workers. Through his union, the New York State Nurses Association, he has had to fight every step of the way to secure basic personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep him and his colleagues safe.\nAs the virus claims more victims, the city is having to think the unthinkable. Rikers Island, the notorious New York jail complex that is fighting its own Covid-19 outbreak and saw the first death of a detainee on Sunday, has been paying prisoners $6 an hour to dig mass graves on a nearby island in the Bronx though recently they switched to contract labourers.\nThis week a New York city council member revealed in a tweet that has since been deleted that mass burials were being considered in local parks, 10 caskets per grave. He later backtracked and said it was a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d.\nPolitical leaders, from De Blasio locally, to Cuomo regionally and Donald Trump nationally, have all tried to calm emotions by pointing to high-profile initiatives intended to provide some relief for hospitals pushed to the edge. The Javits Convention Center has been turned into a military-run hospital; the USNS Comfort, a naval hospital ship, is also now docked in the Hudson River.\nBut so far these headline-grabbing schemes have been full of sound and fury, delivering very little. Between them, the Javits and Comfort have treated just over 100 patients.\nA far less glamorous but much more substantial pattern of events is unfolding in the outer boroughs where most Covid victims live, away from the cameras and the political grandstanding. Here doctors and nurses are working far longer hours, at greater pace, than ever before, and with less protective equipment.\nVentilator shortages mean making phone calls across the wards to see if other units can share. Patients are transferred between hospitals when one is running out of space. And health workers who normally wouldn\u2019t work in an ER or intensive care have been reassigned to fill the need.\nAcross the city, the practice of medicine has been turned on its head. A physician working at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan said he tries to see patients from outside the room window to minimize exposure, often guiding them to adjust their oxygen levels themselves.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having to be innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not necessarily comfortable.\u201d Dozens of health workers have become sick on his unit, he said, but most have recovered quickly and returned to work.\nA physician at Elmhurst hospital, which like Jacobi is in the thick of the crisis, and treats many low-income and immigrant populations, said he is now having conversations with patients and their families about end-of-life care six or seven times a day, instead of once every two weeks.\n\u201cThese discussions are intensely personal and very emotional,\u201d he said. And now that he can\u2019t invite the family into the patient room, or hold the patient\u2019s hand, \u201cthere\u2019s a degree of detachment and depersonalization\u201d.\nWith such heartbreaking conversations now being held across the city, racial disparities continue to distort everything. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, an urgent care physician, has witnessed the gulf in experiences of the virus in central Brooklyn where she works across several clinics.\nWhen she goes to work at a site in an African American or Latino neighborhood she knows she will be inundated with patients with Covid-like symptoms. In higher-income white neighborhoods the demand for health services has actually declined since the start of the crisis, to the extent that several clinics in these areas have been closed.\n\u201cThis pandemic is laying bare the inequities that have always existed in New York city,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t invest in people, we don\u2019t invest in neighborhoods, and this is what we get.\u201d",

        "content": "The country\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is low but frontline staff say public hospitals are unprepared for rise in cases\nChile has received early plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus crisis and boasts Latin America\u2019s highest testing rate for the infection. But health workers on the frontline of the outbreak fear authorities are overestimating hospitals\u2019 capacity to care for critically ill patients.\nThe country\u2019s health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, has praised Chile\u2019s health system as \u201cone of the best on the planet\u201d and insisted that enough beds have been available for critical patients.\nSo far, Chile\u2019s Covid-19 mortality rate is 0.95% \u2013 well below the global average of 4.7% \u2013 but medics warn that this figure is giving authorities a false sense of security.\n\u201cIt\u2019s far too soon to say whether Chile is tackling this successfully,\u201d warned Dr Claudia Cort\u00e9s, an infectious disease specialist in the capital, Santiago.\nDespite increases in the numbers of Covid cases in Chile\u2019s capital, the majority of the city is not under quarantine. Several districts have been on lockdown for the past two weeks, but these measures will be lifted next week in six affected neighbourhoods.\nEarly Covid-19 cases were concentrated in Santiago\u2019s rich neighbourhoods, imported by wealthy families returning from their summer holidays in Europe. Most of those cases were treated in private hospitals.\nBut Cort\u00e9s works between private and public hospitals attending Covid-19 patients \u2013 and she fears death rates will rocket as the virus spreads to poorer areas.\n\u201cPeople in public hospitals get sick differently from ones in private hospitals \u2014 they are like two different worlds,\u201d she said.\nDr Gabriel de la Fuente Tessler, who works with critically ill Covid-19 patients in a Santiago public hospital, also believes the statistics are misleading.\nHe identified the lack of ventilators as a key problem: his hospital has only 18 machines, 14 of which are already in use. Each day, more patients are coming in, and no one is leaving.\n\u201cThe bus is filling up, and soon there won\u2019t be any seats,\u201d Fuente said.\nTemuco, 845km south of the capital, has seen Chile\u2019s highest coronavirus death rates. Located in Chile\u2019s poorest region, Araucania, the city is plagued by high pollution levels, contributing to respiratory sickness in locals.\nTemuco\u2019s central hospital has dedicated three floors to critical Covid-19 patients.\nVideos from the overrun hospital have circulated on social media, with staff resorting to wearing bin bags and adhesive tape as forms of protection. Family of deceased coronavirus patients told local media the hospital was turning away critical patients due to lack of resources.\nDr Carolina Chahin, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, predicted the upcoming winter months would hit Chile\u2019s colder, southern regions hard.\n\u201cWe do not feel prepared,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe public health system in Chile is impoverished,\u201d she said, adding that Temuco\u2019s hospital was the only one in the region with equipment to care for critical Covid-19 cases. Last week, all of its ventilators were at capacity.\nThe health ministry immediately shipped six new machines to the hospital but Chahin said they did not have the staff to operate them.\nDoctors suspect the virus will quickly spread, exacerbated by the Easter holiday weekend. Although authorities are restricting travel, city-dwellers in Santiago have been attempting to get to their second homes on the coast.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for a big wave to break,\u201d said Dr \u00c1lvaro Piffaut, who runs the intensive care unit in Valpara\u00edso, a popular weekend and holiday destination. \u201cWe need a nationwide lockdown, now.\u201d\nPiffaut said his staff were worried and afraid. He believes Ma\u00f1alich is \u201cout of touch\u201d with the reality of public hospitals.\n\u201cWe are going to do everything we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are successful, it\u2019s credit to healthcare workers, not the government.\u201d",

        "content": "Call centre worker says colleagues are terrified of being infected because of unsafe conditions\nCall centre staff at the NHS\u2019s 111 helpline are turning up to work with coronavirus symptoms owing to a lack of adequate sick pay, according to a whistleblower who has filed a complaint to MPs.\nConcerns about health and safety have been raised by call handlers at at least three call centres where thousands of people are employed by outsourcing firms to field calls to the 111 service.\nOne employee, whose complaint has been published by a commons select committee, told the Guardian that colleagues felt ill-prepared for the mass volume of calls and \u201cterrified\u201d they would catch the virus due to \u201cunsafe\u201d working conditions.\nThe call-handler, who works for the outsourcing firm Teleperformance, said communal equipment including coffee machines, exit buttons and door handles were cleaned only twice a day \u2013 which the company does not dispute \u2013 and that staff were given only \u201cvery, very basic\u201d training on how to handle 111 calls about the coronavirus.\nThe government has asked some of the UK\u2019s biggest private call centre operators to massively scale up their NHS 111 capacity amid a 400% increase in calls due to the outbreak. Scores of often inexperienced staff have been hired in huge numbers in only a few days, posing challenges for the employees and companies involved.\nThe call handler, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said: \u201cManagers, floorwalkers and staff have all been thrown into this with very, very basic training and there are a lot of situations that we aren\u2019t prepared for.\u201d\nThe agency worker said staff with potential Covid-19 symptoms, such as a persistent cough, were coming into work as they could not afford to live on the statutory sick pay (SSP) of \u00a396 a week: \u201cThere are lots of people coughing around the call centre who haven\u2019t been self-isolating because there is no guarantee of our jobs being there when we come back\u2026 Most of us can\u2019t survive on SSP.\u201d\nConcerns have also been raised by staff at the Teleperformance\u2019s offices in Manchester and in Scotland. The French company, which is one of the government\u2019s biggest call centre operators, said more than half of its nearly 7,000 call handlers were working from home and that the health, safety and security of its staff \u201chas always been our top priority\u201d. It said it had ordered hundreds of thousands of masks for employees and that cleaning of communal areas had increased from once a week to twice daily.\nGary Slade, the company\u2019s UK chief executive, said it was \u201cfully compliant\u201d with the government\u2019s sick pay guidelines and that anyone who displayed Covid-19 symptoms was being sent home to self-isolate. \u201cThis is not about making money [or] treating people badly \u2013 we\u2019ve never been that way,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is definitely without doubt our number one priority: do what\u2019s right for our people and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\n\u201cAre we perfect? Probably not. There\u2019s always room for improvement. But we\u2019re doing everything we can, working as hard and as fast as we can.\u201d\nThe Guardian found several outsourcing firms recruiting NHS 111 operators for as little as \u00a39.09 an hour \u2013 barely above the UK minimum wage \u2013 despite their role as the first point of contact for people who think they have the coronavirus. One outsourcing firm said in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: \u201cYour personality is far more important than your previous experience.\u201d\nConcerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from \u201cdozens\u201d of staff employed at the firm\u2019s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working \u201cdesk to desk\u201d, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus.\nThe company, which is owned by one of the world\u2019s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: \u201cIf you\u2019re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.\u201d\nSitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian. A spokeswoman confirmed that the company was in dialogue with Pollard and that it was following the safety measures outlined on its website.",

His website says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London.\nThe revelations also prompted a former Tory minister to accuse Jenrick of \u201carrogance\u201d. But Jenrick defended his actions, saying he went to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents. However, the Guardian understands his parents \u2013 who are aged 69 and 79 \u2013 were already receiving help from the local community, raising questions over the necessity of his trip.\nAsked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government\u2019s stay-at-home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think that\u2019s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside.\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary.\u201d\nDowning Street defended Jenrick with a spokesman insisting the minister had complied with social distancing guidelines.\nGovernment instructions say: \u201cYou should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.\u201d The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.\nThe former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who left the party in opposition to its stance on Brexit, tweeted on Friday morning: \u201cThe selfish arrogance of 2 trips #RobertJenrick telling cramped families in inner city high rises or squeezed suburban homes to #StayAtHome is bad enough but justifying it by asserting he didn\u2019t break the rules is shameful. Snr Ministers must practise what they preach.\u201d\nShe added: \u201c#RobertJenrick didn\u2019t break #COVID-19 rules but he totally ignored his own instruction to #StayHome which he repeatedly said in media interviews & from the No 10 podium. It smacks of arrogance. For some time many of us have said Govt messaging must be clear, consistent & honest.\u201d\nSteve Reed, Labour\u2019s new communities spokesman, earlier told the Daily Mail: \u201cMPs need to set an example to everyone about the importance of not moving around the country and if Robert Jenrick can\u2019t provide a very good explanation as to why these trips were necessary then he needs to consider his position.\u201d\nThe row over Jenrick\u2019s movements broke out after Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer last week quit her post following intense criticism after she twice visited her second home. And it came amid ongoing questions over the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, whose location Downing Street has repeatedly refused to clarify when asked this week.\nAfter the Guardian\u2019s story on Jenrick was published, the minister tweeted: \u201cFor clarity \u2013 my parents asked me to deliver some essentials \u2013 including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father\u2019s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.\u201d\nDefending moving to his Herefordshire property, he told the Mail that his family considered it the family home.\nNearly three weeks ago the government published guidance warning people against all but essential travel, highlighting this \u201cdoes not include visits to second homes\u201d and that \u201cpeople must remain in their primary residence\u201d.\nJenrick\u2019s actions were defended by others, with Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), suggesting it sounded like Jenrick had remained within the four \u201cclear\u201d guidelines by travelling 40 miles to deliver medicine and other essential items.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment on Mr Jenrick. It sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking at the daily No 10 lobby briefing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made.\n\u201cWe are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules.\u201d",

At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers for the media executive persuaded the US district judge Pamela Chen to exempt Lopez\u2019s shares in the company from the bail package.\nLopez\u2019s attorney Matthew Umhofer had argued that Lopez\u2019s bond amount should be significantly reduced to $500,000 with no curfew or prior permission for domestic travel. But Chen ultimately rejected the arguments.\nIn arguing against Lopez\u2019s travel restrictions, Umhofer told the court that FBI agents had \u201cto come to Mr Lopez\u2019s door\u201d in July of 2016 with regards to the justice department\u2019s sprawling investigation of football corruption, indicating the former executive had known of his interest to prosecutors for over three years.\nMartinez, who left Fox in May 2019, according to his professional social networking page, was also forced by the government to hand over a number firearms to local police in Doral, Florida, as part of his bond.\nProsecutors allege that Lopez and Martinez had \u201crelied on loyalty secured through the payment of bribes\u201d to South American football officials in order to \u201cadvance the business interest of Fox\u201d and obtain \u201cconfidential bidding information\u201d to win American broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\nThe alleged scheme occurred during Rupert Murdoch\u2019s ownership of 21st Century Fox. He sold the company to Disney for $71bn in March 2019.\nFox and Disney have declined to comment on the indictments.\nThe US justice department\u2019s investigation into corruption in world football\u2019s governing body, Fifa, was announced at dawn raid in July 2015.\nTwenty-six individuals have pleaded guilty as part of the investigation, with two former South American administrators found guilty at trial in 2017.",

        "content": "Green activist turned China hawk shares president\u2019s brittle traits and wrote books quoting expert who turned out to be fictitious version of himself\nThe rise of Peter Navarro \u2013 the man put in charge of marshalling emergency US production of medical equipment in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 is in many ways a classic story of the Trump era.\nThe 70-year-old White House trade adviser was first recruited by Trump because he wrote a string of books about the Chinese strategic threat \u2013 one called Death by China \u2013 despite having spent almost no time in the country and having no grasp of the language.\nFive of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views.\nNavarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a showdown in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug.\nWhen asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, Navarro replied: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d\nPeople who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic.\nBefore coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego.\nHis former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics.\n\u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant.\nNavarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics. He had started out as a registered Republican but became an anti-growth, environmentalist independent, then a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1996, promoted energetically but unsuccessfully by Hillary Clinton.\nNavarro came closest to victory in 1992 when he emerged as the surprise contender to be San Diego mayor, taking on the city\u2019s entrenched Republican establishment. He stood as an independent, with a working-class background, determined to stand up for the little guy in the face of rampant development. He called his movement Plan (Prevent Los Angelization Now) and he appeared to have a good chance of winning going into a final television debate a couple of days before the vote.\nTowards the end of the debate the Republican candidate, Susan Golding, became emotional as she regretted the bruising nature of the campaign, in which the candidates had exchanged multiple slurs. Navarro misjudged the moment, accusing Golding of acting. He came across as cynical and unfeeling, and lost the race at the final hurdle.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about the process that really brings out your essence,\u201d Remer said. \u201cAnd in this case it brought out Peter\u2019s essence, which is that he has no people skills at all, and he has no empathy for other people.\u201d\nThe personality problem got worse with each defeat, according to Navarro\u2019s former spokeswoman, Lisa Ross, who worked with him on four campaigns.\n\u201cAs the years went on and as he kept losing campaign after campaign, he became more and more brittle, more and more confrontational, and ended up \u2026 alienating just about everyone,\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeter was not a nice person at the end of the day \u2026 He can really get in your face.\u201d\nRoss said she watched Navarro\u2019s extraordinary rise in Trump\u2019s world with open-mouthed astonishment.\n\u201cHe was the guy who was waving his arms in front of the bulldozer, so it was surprising when he went to work for the biggest bulldozer in the country,\u201d she said, speculating it was his personality that drew Navarro into such close orbit of the president.\n\u201cIt occurred to me that really Peter and Trump are the same kind of animal. They\u2019re very media savvy but very brittle,\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeter can be a real bully and maybe that\u2019s why Trump picked him. He wanted a bully to do the job.\u201d\nNavarro\u2019s rollicking 1998 memoir, San Diego Confidential, displays some of the bravado that appears to have attracted Trump, who is said to refer to him as \u201cmy Peter\u201d.\nIn the book Navarro acknowledged his reputation as \u201cthe cruelest and meanest son-of-a-bitch that ever ran for office in San Diego\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have any concern at all about making stuff up about my opponent that isn\u2019t exactly true \u2013 I know that bastard running against me doesn\u2019t have any scruples either.\u201d\nAs well as echoing some of Trump\u2019s own traits, Navarro has also shown, on occasion, the gift of prescience. His tirades against China and free trade anticipated the rhetoric that helped Trump win the presidency. In the first two years of the administration, though often marginalised by more powerful, pro-trade officials, he has emerged triumphant long after they have gone.\n\u201cHe is extraordinarily influential in the White House and whether you like him or not, whether you agree with his politics he caught on early with Donald Trump,\u201d said Walter Lohman, the director of Asian studies at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cHe sort of scratches an itch that Donald Trump has.\u201d\nNavarro was also vindicated in his dire warnings about the threat of Covid-19, sending a memo to the president in late January with an estimate that it could kill more than half a million Americans and cost close to $6tn. Trump has said he has no recollection of seeing the memo but the White House Cassandra has since emerged looking adept by comparison to the blithe counsel of treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nNavarro, the environmental activist turned China hawk, now has one of the most important jobs in the country as the coronavirus pandemic strengthen its grip. He has to save tens of thousands of lives in the face of woefully inadequate preparation by his own administration. He is equipped with little relevant experience and few allies, but with a fierce confidence in his own convictions.",

        "content": "Law that extends Hun Sen\u2019s authority will further weaken democratic rights, say critics\nCambodia\u2019s national assembly has passed a state of emergency law granting the country\u2019s autocratic leader, Hun Sen, vast new powers, in what rights groups say is a cynical move to exploit the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe legislation, passed on Friday, is expected to further weaken democratic rights in a country that has no functioning opposition and where key political opponents are either in prison or exile.\nWhile human rights experts agreed some restrictions were needed to slow the spread of coronavirus, it is feared that many leaders are using the emergency to grab power.\nIn Cambodia, the new legislation contains sweeping provisions allowing the government to carry out unlimited surveillance of telecommunications and to control the press and social media. The government would also gain the ability to restrict freedom of movement and assembly, seize private property and enforce quarantines.\nIn addition, a catch-all clause would authorise \u201cother measures that are deemed appropriate and necessary in response to the state of emergency\u201d.\nHun Sen initially downplayed the threat of coronavirus, and at one point threatened to throw journalists out of press conferences if they wore masks. When the Westerdam cruise ship was turned away by several other countries concerned about the outbreak, Hun Sen not only allowed the ship to dock but attracted international attention by hugging passengers as they disembarked.\nThe country, where a lack of media freedom means scrutiny is limited, has since recorded 115 cases of the virus. Schools and entertainment venues have been shut, and wider travel restrictions announced.\nThe state of emergency could be invoked whenever the country is considered to be facing a great risk, such as in a pandemic, war or disruption to public order, according to the law.\nAnyone found guilty of disobeying emergency measures, which are vaguely worded and could be used to target government critics, faces 10 years in prison.\nDavid Griffiths, director of the office of the secretary-general at Amnesty International, described the legislation as indefensible.\n\u201cThis is a blatant exploitation of public panic around Covid-19 and threatens to eviscerate the human rights protections which are guaranteed by the Cambodian constitution and international human rights law,\u201d he said.\nIndependent journalists, government critics and people speaking about Covid-19 online are being arrested on a daily basis, he added.\nThis week, Sovann Rithy, a journalist working for broadcaster TVFB, was arrested for quoting a recent speech by Hun Sen in which the prime minister said: \u201cIf motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.\u201d The police arrested Rithy, stating that Hun Sen\u2019s words were intended as a joke.\nGriffiths said: \u201cThe idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme.\u201d\nAsean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian countries, said similar laws are being used across the region to crack down on critics.\nThis includes the Philippines, where individuals can be jailed for spreading false information about Covid-19, and Thailand, where an emergency decree allows the prime minister to censor publications for a broad range of reasons. Officials in Thailand also have additional powers to arrest and hold people without charge if they are suspected of having a role in causing an emergency.\nThailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Hun Sen, \u201chave both shown in the past already creative ways to hang on to power\u201d, said Teddy Baguilat, a former Philippines MP and board member of APHR. \u201cWe need to make sure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become their new tool to further legitimise and secure their authoritarian leadership.\u201d",

But normal rules on the need for balanced budgets will apply where the cash is spent on the wider economy.\nOn the toxic issue of the so-called coronabonds, under which the EU member states would borrow on the international financial markets on the same terms and share liability, the agreed text only referred to governments working on \u201cinnovative financial instruments, consistent with EU treaties\u201d to create a rescue fund.\nFrance\u2019s finance minister, Bruno le Maire, insisted on Friday that this would ultimately equate to the joint issuance of debt, despite the opposition of the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Germany.\nLe Maire said: \u201cI have a firm conviction that the fund will see the light of day and there will be debt raised jointly in a form that remains to be determined.\n\u201cIt means what it means. The only instrument that does not yet exist in European financing is joint debt.\u201d\nWopke Hoekstra, the Dutch finance minister, said he was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the outcome after 16 hours of talks, adding of coronabonds that \u201cthere won\u2019t be any\u201d. He told Dutch TV stations: \u201cSometimes you have to put your foot down.\u201d\nThe deal will now be put to the leaders of the 27 member states, with little apparent room for compromise on the longer-term economic response to the coronavirus. For the Italian government, the pandemic has become a test of the strength of EU solidarity.\nProfessor Alberto Alemanno, from the HEC Paris Business School, said: \u201cWe can expect national leaders to offer very different interrogations of the agreement. Several major issues remain open and need to be hammered down, notably the rescue fund\u2019s sourcing.\u201d\nThe entire package included agreement on boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new \u20ac100bn scheme proposed by the European commission to keep funding employee salaries if they are put on reduced hours. All of the measures will need to be signed off by 27 heads of state and government.\nCharles Michel, the former prime minister of Belgium, who is now president of the European council, the EU decision-making body comprised of heads of member states, said he would hold an e-summit with leaders on 23 April.\nHe said: \u201cThe agreement of the Eurogroup is a significant breakthrough. More than half a trillion euros are now available to shield European Union countries, workers and businesses. With this unparalleled package, we shoulder the burden of the crisis together. This compromise is aimed at quick targeted relief... It is time to lay the ground for a robust economic recovery.\u201d",

Within a matter of a few weeks, our previous worst-case scenario is looking better than our latest estimates.\n\u201cBut without immediate government relief measures, there will not be an industry left standing.

        "content": "The state\u2019s holding of a primary during a pandemic is just the latest example of Republicans\u2019 naked bid to keep power at all costs\nLess than 72 hours before polls opened in Wisconsin on 7 April, the state legislature convened to weigh an emergency request from the governor, Tony Evers. With Covid-19 cases in the thousands, Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state.\nIt was a meeting only in name. Republicans, who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly, sent just one member. He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor\u2019s request. It took just 17 seconds. In the Republican-controlled state senate, the same thing happened, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. It took even less time.\nThe legislature\u2019s defiance was a naked display of unabashed power \u2013 an elected body refusing its governor\u2019s request and turning its back on its constituents in a time of crisis.\nThe Republican lawmakers who didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power. Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting, it was a stunning series of events.\nThat assault on democracy began in 2011, when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin. It was part of a national Republican effort, called Project Redmap, to capture state legislatures and, with those victories, to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district. The goal of Redmap was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats \u2013 a process called gerrymandering. The writer and author David Daley called Project Redmap \u201cthe most audacious political heist of modern times\u201d.\nKarl Rove, former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal, claiming, rightly, that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress. Later, according to the New Yorker, when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas, he said \u201cPeople call us a vast rightwing conspiracy. But we\u2019re really a half-assed rightwing conspiracy. Now it\u2019s time to get serious.\u201d\nFor $1.1m \u2013 a small sum in campaign dollars \u2013 Republicans won the state legislature and went on to curb Democratic power by passing a strict voter ID law, making it harder for minorities and students to vote, and later stripped statewide elected officials of some of their authority.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many people who are aware of what\u2019s going on, and are tuned into politics and government in this state, would say that it\u2019s anything even resembling a democracy,\u201d said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a government watchdog group.\nOn Tuesday, voters risked their lives to go to the polls, waiting hours in line in Milwaukee. So far, turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016, and that is believed to benefit Republicans, who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court. It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers\u2019 last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward.\nWisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state, and there had been fights over redistricting before. But in 2011, Republicans took it to a new level. They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol, where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts. They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn, even requiring Republican lawmakers to sign agreements to keep discussions about the maps secret.\nRepublicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year. \u201cThe maps we pass will determine who\u2019s here 10 years from now,\u201d one memo at the time read. One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat in the state general assembly, was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts, Daley wrote in Ratfked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count.\nThe plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted. In 2012, the first election with the new map in place, Republicans won less than half the votes, but conquered 60 of the state\u2019s 99 assembly seats. The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016, despite earning just over 50% of the statewide vote.\n\u201cIt seems impervious to what happens with voters,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt really looks like an unresponsive institution.\u201d\nMichael Li, a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU, wrote this week: \u201cWisconsin\u2019s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a minority of the vote.\n\u201cRepublicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority,\u201d he wrote. Wisconsin\u2019s maps were crafted with such micro-precision that even if Democrats managed to win a historically high 54% of the two-party vote \u2013 a level they\u2019ve reached only once in the last 20 years \u2013 Republicans would still end up with a solid nine-seat majority in the state assembly.\u201d\nAs the gerrymandering project wore on in 2011, Republicans also drafted one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country. It required Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID such as a driver\u2019s license or passport to vote. Students could only use their school IDs if they contained a signature and an expiration date.\nDespite efforts to block it in court, the law went into effect for the first time in 2016. One study estimated the law could have deterred as many as 23,252 people from voting in Milwaukee and Dane counties, two of the state\u2019s largest, and both Democratic strongholds. Donald Trump won the state by just under 23,000 votes.\nRuth Greenwood, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, said the link between voter ID laws and gerrymandering was undeniable. \u201cIt definitely all feeds on itself,\u201d she said. \u201cGerrymandering has meant there are less competitive elections and Republicans know they can maintain the majority. So they continue to restrict the electorate to advantage themselves.\u201d\nA few weeks after the 2016 election, Greenwood and a team of lawyers helped convince a three-judge panel to strike down the gerrymandered assembly map, saying it was so severely manipulated that it violated the US constitution. But in 2018, the US supreme court, in a 5-4 vote, overruled the lower court on technical grounds and sent the case back for further review. One year later, it would rule that federal courts could do nothing to stop partisan gerrymandering.\nThe maps Republicans secretly drew in 2011 laid the foundation for the power they used to force an unprecedented election on Tuesday. Had it not been for gerrymandering, voters in the state might not have had to risk their health to vote, said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, another lawyer who helped challenge the assembly map in federal court.\n\u201cIf you had fair maps, you would have an evenly divided legislature; you might well have a Democratic legislature, given how well Democrats did in 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have gone along with the governor and agreed to sensible changes in the election schedule and the manner of conducting the election.\u201d\nOne of the politicians able to consolidate the most power in Wisconsin is Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the state assembly. In addition to rebuffing Evers\u2019 efforts to postpone the election, Vos blamed Milwaukee officials for warning it wasn\u2019t safe to run Tuesday\u2019s election.\nOn election day, Vos volunteered at the polls. Speaking to reporters, he again brushed off concerns about holding elections. Dressed head-to-toe in protective equipment, he gave incorrect information about how to request an absentee ballot, before proclaiming it was \u201cperfectly safe to go out\u201d.",

        "content": "From making PPE visors to raising hospital funds, UK schools and universities are rising to the challenge\nFrom university and school closures to A-level cancellations, young people have been deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Despite this, staff and students across the UK are launching initiatives to support both their local community and the NHS.\nHarrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, has repurposed its design department as a PPE production line, and has made more than 1,000 visors so far.\nIts headteacher, Neil Renton, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had parents who\u2019ve been furloughed or lost jobs, who are ex-engineers, asking if they can help. We\u2019ve not been able to support that as we\u2019ve had so many staff members volunteer. I think it comes from an overwhelming desire from our teachers, who believe in public service, to make a difference.\u201d\nThe visors have been sent to local hospitals, paramedics and GP surgeries, as well as alumni working on the frontline.\nJack Sheriff, who left the school in 2014, is a junior doctor on a coronavirus ward in the Midlands, and received a pack of six visors last week, stamped with the school\u2019s emblem, the NHS logo, and the message \u201cwe stand together\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have contact with people from your past who helped you get to where you are, and who are still supporting you and thinking of you. It\u2019s a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.\u201d\nSchools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities.\nAt Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out 145 food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays.\nThe headteacher, Helen Stout, said: \u201cThe butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re doing our bit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a bit of a different role. It\u2019s not just being head of a primary school, it\u2019s managing community spirit.\u201d\nAlongside staff-led directives to support pupils, students are embracing initiatives to celebrate and assist the key workers around them.\nAt Thornhill College in Derry, many students expressed their fear and anxiety at the pandemic, many of whom had family and friends working on the frontline of the NHS. In response, the school asked for tributes to NHS staff to share on social media, and have been overwhelmed with the response. Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of \u00a3500 \u2013 a figure that has been trebled in just two days.\n\u201cIt really has taken on a life of its own,\u201d said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re so proud. Past pupils, teachers, mums, grannies and aunts are all doing it too.\n\u201cOur corridors are silent and classrooms are empty, it doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s only little, small things we\u2019re doing but it\u2019s contributing to that overwhelming feeling of gratitude for the frontline.\u201d\nMedical students across the UK have been supporting NHS workers by babysitting for children, buying groceries, or driving them to work, as part of the National Health Supporters organisation, which receives between 50 and 100 requests for babysitting each day.\nFourth-year medical student Saif Khan set up a branch in Manchester where he studies, which is now helping about 25 families in the city.\nHe said: \u201cWhen my course got put on hold, we had free time, and I thought we could help NHS colleagues, many are our teachers and mentors. I put a post on Facebook to our medical school society and within three days I had received 400 responses to be volunteers from not only medical students, but other healthcare students like nurses and speech therapists.\u201d\nOther medical students have been joining the NHS prematurely, taking a combination of paid and voluntary roles in hospitals to support the strained service.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at medical school for five years, and the last two years I\u2019ve been in a purely clinical setting, so I\u2019m familiar with hospitals,\u201d said Phoebe Gray, a penultimate-year medical student who signed up to work at her local hospital in Bristol on the day her exams were cancelled. \u201cIt seemed silly just to sit around. It feels like we ought to be there when hospitals need us.\u201d\nOn her induction day, Gray was joined by scores of other trainees from across the medical profession, from mental health nurses to paramedics.\nShe is now working as a nursing assistant in an intensive care unit, caring for a combination of cardiovascular and coronavirus patients \u2013 her first time working in a nursing role.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to feel like a cog in a moving machine,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou do hear horror stories, but when you hear people clapping outside on a Thursday evening, it does make you proud. Obviously it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\nCoronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

        "content": "In the coronavirus pandemic, everyone is trying to create new rules by constantly, volubly judging each other. Better to realise we don\u2019t know the pressures others are under\nBefore we went into lockdown, I was trying to persuade my mother to reduce her contact circle to five. It seems absurd, now that everyone of advanced age and comorbidities has been told to see no one at all, but way back then (three weeks ago), this seemed reasonable. She immediately bartered the number up to six. It was like negotiating with Tony Soprano: there was no way she was coming out of the deal without the upper hand. Then I asked her how she planned to tell the rest of her associates that they weren\u2019t on the list, and she said: \u201cGood heavens, I\u2019m not going to tell them. That would be so rude!\u201d\nThen the list was reduced to zero, but mysteriously, one of the original six went round anyway to fix her letterbox. I asked what was the point of fixing her letterbox, when the only important letter she was going to get would be from the government, telling her not to have anyone round, irrespective of whether or not she had a defective letterbox. She said she would prefer to have less advice, and be given a lethal injection. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d she said, graciously. \u201cI\u201dm not sure whether the main impediment to euthanasia is whether or not you mind,\u201d I observed, extremely calmly and not at all sarcastically.\nMy friend\u2019s mum got a guy round to fix her cutlery drawer, which has been broken for two years. My sister\u2019s neighbour, supposedly in full cocoon, still goes to the shop every day and, when she said she would go for him, he said: \u201cI\u2019m just in and out. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking anyone to dance.\u201d Another cocoon-candidate in my life goes out before dawn every morning just to smell the sea, like the bloody French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman. My uncle spent the night before the pubs closed in a Wetherspoon\u2019s, which I disapprove of in 17 different ways. It is very annoying trying to get the people who should take this the most seriously to take it seriously at all. But it\u2019s also sort of a duff judgment to make, because when you have a life-limiting condition, and even before this happened, you already felt like \u2013 in my mother\u2019s words \u2013 a hot-air balloon with a terminal puncture, waiting to hit the ground, it is highly debatable and a completely personal matter whether you want to spend 12 of what is a finite number of weeks completely on your own.\nNot everyone over 70 is in the same situation. For some, that \u201cunderlying health condition\u201d means they wouldn\u2019t even be admitted to hospital, nor want to be. It simply isn\u2019t possible to adjudicate across the piece, from a distance, as if the elderly were one homogeneous mass.\nYet we are all trying to build new rules, at speed, and the easiest way to do so is to constantly, volubly judge each other. Since the sun came out, it has been like a new season of censoriousness. In any normal year, the spaghetti straps would appear and society\u2019s sap would start to rise. This year, it\u2019s a super-charged indignation. Families are furious with joggers, cyclists are furious with bipeds, everyone hates dog walkers, except anyone with a dog, who is wondering why dogless people have to be out at all. The usual great sunbather debate \u2013 regular human beings getting vitamin D, or spawn of Satan? (somebody get The Moral Maze on the case) \u2013 was less interesting to me than my own bugbear, people with huge gardens and/ or no clue what it\u2019s like to live with a two-year-old and a four-year-old, waxing judgmental about why everyone couldn\u2019t do the responsible thing and remain totally indoors, open a window if they felt so stir crazy. But I got my own comeuppance with that, when I launched full tilt into a fight on Twitter with one of the \u201cjust stay indoors\u201d brigade, only to find that she was quarantined away from her own children, and had been for weeks, because she worked in a hospital. So yes, I was categorically the arsehole.\nAll bets are off, and there are no shortcuts: you cannot possibly guess why that person is behaving the way they are, or saying the things they do. You can\u2019t know what pressures they are under, or whether it was the same or better or worse yesterday. You can\u2019t know what they think about their own mortality, or why. You can\u2019t even know for sure what bubbling tensions are driving your own reactions, until you wake up at 5am, dreaming about Harriet Harman trying to save a sinking island through the medium of dance, and realise it\u2019s possible you are more anxious than you thought. There is really no alternative but to put our own finger-pointing on ice, or under lockdown, if you prefer.\nMy mother, incidentally, was right and there appears to be an unlimited number of people who wish they were on her list-of-zero. Someone left a bottle of ros\u00e9 on her doorstep the other day, and she was worrying that she didn\u2019t know who to thank. I said: \u201cPut a giant sign on your door, saying, \u2018Thanks for the ros\u00e9.\u2019 That way, the person will feel thanked, and the whole street will know that you appreciate ros\u00e9.\u201d I might be insensitive but I am also a stone cold genius.\n Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

        "content": "British Museum expert rejects claim that Europe is flooded with recently stolen artefacts\nReporting of the illegal trade in antiquities from Iraq and Syria is leading to a false impression that the European market is flooded with looted items, according to a British Museum curator.\nSt John Simpson, a senior curator and archaeologist in the British Museum\u2019s Middle East department, said a recent report claiming that more than 98% of items on some European markets did not have proven legal provenance \u2013 and in some cases could be linked to terrorist organisations \u2013 was misleading.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong tendency to say that all objects without provenance are the produce of recent looting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some objects have been circulating for decades, if not longer. It\u2019s a case of assessing each item on its own merits.\u201d\nSimpson said that in his role as an adviser for UK law enforcement on items that have been seized on exit or entry into the country, there has yet to be a proven case of a recently looted item from Syria being discovered in Britain.\nHe said: \u201cI think the really telling statistic is that over the last eight years of the Syrian civil war we have yet to prove any objects have come into Britain that demonstrably come from looting in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are investigating cases at the moment but that is a remarkable figure.\u201d\nIn March, a UN-backed report stated Germany had become an international destination for trafficking illegal antiquities from the eastern Mediterranean, including Iraq and Syria, with almost half of the 6,000 examined items coming from the two countries.\nThe study, released by the German federal cultural foundation, looked at antiquities on sale in Germany between 2015 and 2018, and found only 2.1% had proven legal provenance.\nMarkus Hilgert, general secretary of the foundation, said the report\u2019s findings were shocking, especially in light of EU trade restrictions in place for both Iraq and Syria. \u201cIn view of the ongoing, extensive destruction and looting of archaeological cultural assets in Iraq and Syria, this is an alarming finding,\u201d Hilgert added.\nSimpson said in Syria there had been \u201cad-hoc and opportunistic looting\u201d but the picture painted by the German foundation\u2019s study was down to \u201crather simplistic\u201d reporting. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like see every one of those objects personally to be confident that they are from recent looting rather than older items or fakes.\u201d\nThe curator said the situation in the UK is completely different from the 1990s, when large numbers of looted Iraqi items were sold. He called for \u201ccaution and curatorial intelligence\u201d to be used when deciding when and where items originated.\n\u201cSome of these objects floating around on the western market could actually come not from recent looting, they\u2019re probably coming from 1990s or 2003 looting,\u201d he added.\nThe British Museum recently launched the Circulating Artefacts project, to \u201ccounteract looting and trafficking of cultural artefacts\u201d. It created a database of objects designed to help curb the trade in illicit objects from Sudan and Egypt.\nBut it has also been criticised for items in its collection that were acquired by looting, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken in a \u201cpunitive expedition\u201d led by British troops in 1897.\nSenegalese academic Felwine Sarr co-authored a report that recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa. He criticised the British Museum for acting like \u201can ostrich with its head in the sand\u201d after not addressing calls for items acquired by colonial-era looting to be returned.\nIn response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a \u201ctransparent focus on the provenance of objects\u201d, adding that the museum agreed with the report\u2019s call for the establishment of \u201cnew and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa\u201d.",

Johnson was \u201cenormously grateful for the care he\u2019s receiving,\u201d the official added, saying \u201che was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward\u201d.\nA No 10 spokesman added later on Friday: \u201cThe prime minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery.\n\u201cHe has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease.\u201d\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, told the daily briefing that Johnson\u2019s condition continued to improve. \u201cHe wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas\u2019 for the incredible care he has received,\u201d Hancock said.\nThe updates came after the prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley, spoke of the improvement in his son\u2019s condition, saying he was \u201camazingly thankful\u201d for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative of the nation\u2019s outpouring of support.\nBut he insisted his son \u2013 who is still being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London \u2013 must rest, warning that he cannot get \u201cstraight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cTo use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now.\u201d\nThere will be just one daily update about Johnson\u2019s condition now he is out of intensive care, the spokesman said. Asked what contact Johnson had had with No 10, he added: \u201cThe PM is just beginning his recovery and he will be taking advice from his medical team.\u201d\nOn Thursday evening, Downing Street said Johnson, 55, had been moved from intensive care back to the ward \u201cwhere he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery\u201d. He was taken into hospital on Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and high temperature, persisted and he was moved to intensive care on Monday evening.\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for the prime minister, earlier said Johnson was making \u201cpositive steps forward\u201d.\nJohnson\u2019s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 who has also had a bout of suspected Covid-19 \u2013 responded to the news by posting a rainbow on Twitter and a series of clapping emojis to show support for the NHS.\nOn Friday morning Johnson\u2019s 79-year-old father also issued thanks. \u201cRelief is the right word,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, adding: \u201cI feel tremendously grateful obviously on behalf of the family, Boris\u2019s family, my family, family members all over the place, and also, of course, amazingly thankful as well. Thankful for the tremendous outpouring of which we have seen.\u201d\nBut he warned his son must rest. \u201cThis is pretty straightforward now. He must rest up. As I understand it ... he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don\u2019t think you can say this is out of the woods now,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.\u201d\nHe also explained his son\u2019s illness had highlighted the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cI do think about this whole event of Boris going into intensive care, and now ... coming out, it has actually served an amazing purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s got the whole country to realise this is a serious event. If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven\u2019s sake, well it does come close to home.\u201d",

        "content": "Shadow foreign secretary wants to know why thousands remain stranded a fortnight after \u00a375m rescue mission was announced\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, is demanding an immediate meeting with the head of the Foreign Office as thousands of British nationals remain stranded abroad two weeks after Dominic Raab unveiled his \u00a375m coronavirus rescue mission.\nNandy\u2019s office has let the foreign secretary know they are seeking a meeting with the permanent secretary \u201cas an absolute matter of urgency\u201d, a spokesman said after a conference call with 70 MPs and staff to discuss the continuing repatriation crisis.\nMPs expressed concern about Britons stranded in India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, which closed its borders two weeks ago.\nThey also expressed frustration that 11 new rescue flights were being laid on for India while none were being planned for Pakistan, where it emerged there could be as many as 20,000 stranded Britons.\nDuring the call there were also complaints that the Foreign Office was fobbing off politicians who were making representations about their constituents with stock emails and an \u201cauto-response\u201d saying emails were not being monitored.\nPlanes organised by the government have already been organised for Peru, Ghana, Algeria, India, Nepal and South Africa, with Ecuador and Bolivia also on the list. There have also been calls for charter flights to be laid on to Argentina.\nA retired GP, Adrienne Newton, who has been stranded for weeks in C\u00f3rdoba, 700km (435 miles) from Buenos Aires, said the embassy, had sent details at 1am on the day of a potential Air France flight from Buenos Aires.\nAfter protesting on Twitter that there were no connections to the capital because of the lockdown, the embassy tweeted details of a transport company \u201cthat has worked with other embassies, good luck!\u201d, she said.\n\u201cIf other countries are contracting companies to transport its nationals to airports for flights home, why isn\u2019t ours? Clearly it\u2019s not a logistical issue. The flight yesterday with KLM left Buenos Aires half empty. I am starting to think this is not just a question of inefficiency,\u201d she added.\nMeanwhile, the Foreign Office says that as long as the Pakistani government allows the national airline, PIA, to continue repatriation flights to London, there is no need to charter flights.\nIt says it has already repatriated 4,000 of 6,000 people stranded in that country and was confident it could get thousands more home on PIA flights.\nHowever, in a conference call between the government\u2019s South Asia minister, Lord Ahmad, the UK high commissioner in Pakistan and 10 MPs with large numbers of constituents stranded, it emerged there could be tens of thousands of Britons stuck in the country.\nSam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, who was on the call, said: \u201cI know the British high commission has been working very hard on this. They said that there\u2019s going to be a series of more flights. They\u2019re saying there are up to 20,000 people who want to come home.\u201d\nHe added that MPs on the call raised the issue of the \u201clack of faith\u201d in PIA to deliver further flights after constituents paid out thousands of pounds for tickets on flights that were cancelled. But he was told that charter flights would be difficult. \u201cThey felt the issues were going to be that the Pakistan government were not going to open the international airspace to obviously allow charter flights to take place. So they were saying essentially the only option is PIA.\u201d\nToday, I led 90 cross-party MPs & Peers in writing to @DominicRaab about the dire situation for those British nationals who are stranded in Pakistan.The Govt's continued reliance on the commercial operation of @Official_PIA is no longer tenable & they must look at alternatives. pic.twitter.com/oGQ0UHpW4r\nAfzal Khan, the shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said that British nationals in Pakistan were \u201cstill having to pay for the chaotic mismanagement of PIA and the British repatriation effort\u201d, in a letter to Raab.\n\u200bA spokesperson for the FCO said Lord Ahmad and the high commission were \u201cin close contact with their Pakistani counterparts as well as PIA, the national carrier, to ensure that commercial flight routes are kept open between our two countries.\u201d\nIt added that there had been 17 flights between Pakistan for the UK since 4 April, \u201creturning in excess of 6000 people to the UK\u201d. It said it was working hard with the local authorities to keep flights \u201coperational in the coming days.\u201d",

        "content": "North Holland thinks unproven 600mph magnetic hovertrain could help replace air travel\nSwifter than trains, safer than cars and far less damaging to the environment than planes, the Dutch province of North Holland believes the hyperloop might be the future.\nPlans are being drawn up for Amsterdam to be connected to other European cities by the futuristic high-speed mode of transportation comprising a magnetic hovertrain in an air-free tube able to travel at speeds of over 600mph due to the lack of friction and drag.\nA study carried out by a Dutch technology startup, Hardt Hyperloop, in collaboration with the province, has found the hyperloop could reduce commuting times from Amsterdam to Paris, Brussels, Du\u0308sseldorf or Frankfurt from \u201chours to minutes\u201d, boasting that \u201cborders would, quite literally, become blurred\u201d.\nCommuters stepping into a hyperloop pod in Amsterdam could arrive in Brussels in under 30 minutes or in Paris in 90 minutes rather than the current three and half hours, the study suggests.\nIt is yet to be seen how the coronavirus pandemic will affect the transnational project at a time when borders are being shut and an economic recession is widely predicted.\nIn addition, the practicality of the hyperloop has been questioned ever since the entrepreneur Elon Musk suggested back in 2013 that the aerodynamic pods could be the future of high-speed travel for passengers and freight, given its relatively low energy use.\nQuestions have been raised about its value for money, with critics adamant that incremental changes to current transport are a better bet than inventing a fifth mode to join cars, trains, boats and planes. Australia is the latest to reject it in favour of tried and trusted high-speed rail.\nBut Jeroen Olthof, the deputy responsible for mobility in North Holland, said he had been impressed by the possibility of creating a \u201ccompact region\u201d of five European cities in which commuters could travel door-to-door within an hour.\nEconomic modelling published this week suggests such time-saving would deliver an additional \u20ac275bn (\u00a3241bn) in GDP for the province, equating to growth of 121%.\nNot only would Amsterdam be served by a larger workforce but the drop in demand for short-haul flights from Schiphol airport could lead to a reduction of about 20,000 to 24,000 aircraft movements in 2040, it is claimed.\nOlthof said: \u201cWe know that people are willing to travel from door to door for up to one hour for their work. With such a super-fast hyperloop, it suddenly becomes possible to travel much longer commuting distances. That sounds promising.\n\u201cThat is why we are going to consult with other authorities and parties to continue this research.\u201d\nHardt Hyperloop, which was founded after winning the international hyperloop competition organised by Musk in 2017, is partnering with companies including Tata Steel on the project.\nA first high-speed test facility is being built in the Dutch province of Groningen with a three kilometre test track, making it the first in Europe of its kind. A 30 metre low-speed test tunnel has already been built in Delft.\nHardt Hyperloop has been looking at how its passenger-carrying pods \u2013 which will be propelled through a tube \u2013 might also be able to change routes by switching lanes without reducing speed.",

        "content": "Nick Thomas-Symonds praises police and promises to back frontline officers\nLabour must be a party of responsibility that backs frontline police officers and promises to keep the public safe from crime, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the Welsh MP, promoted to the shadow cabinet in Keir Starmer\u2019s comprehensive reshuffle last weekend, said crime was a \u201cprogressive issue\u201d, and lavished praise on the police for enforcing the coronavirus lockdown.\n\u201cLabour have a message that we will keep you, your family and your community safe. That\u2019s very much the approach that I come from,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI grew up in the constituency I represent, in the eastern valley of the South Wales coalfields, in an era when jobs and opportunities were being taken away by the Thatcher government. And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.\u201d\n\u201cResponsibility is the word that I would use,\u201d he said. \u201cResponsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Crimes have victims; they damage the fabric of that society. But there is a responsibility for government as well, and it\u2019s the responsibility to keep people safe.\u201d\nHe was at pains to praise the police officers given the task of enforcing the coronavirus lockdown, despite widely cited instances of over-zealousness.\n\u201cI\u2019ve obviously seen those various incidents that have happened. But I just think it\u2019s unfair when I as a politician have handed over this enormous set of powers, to then start picking on particular officers and particular forces.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is to recognise the difficult situation, and the latitude we do need to give to our officers,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, I think the police are getting it right.\u201d\nWith some of the best-known figures in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet relegated to the backbenches, either voluntarily or at Starmer\u2019s hand, Thomas-Symonds and his new shadow cabinet colleagues will be intently scrutinised for clues to Labour\u2019s direction.\nLike the party\u2019s new leader, he strikes a resolutely constructive tone regarding the government\u2019s handling of the virus.\n\u201cIn a public health emergency, a national crisis like this \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to think of anything comparable since 1945, frankly \u2013 my view is that we have to support the government in the aim of minimising loss of life through the crisis. That\u2019s absolutely in the national interest, and absolutely what we aim to do. But we have to balance it with scrutiny,\u201d he said.\nBut Thomas-Symonds said he hoped the crucial frontline role played by NHS workers and others in the crisis, and the weekly nationwide round of applause, would help to change attitudes to migration.\nThe government\u2019s new points-based system, due to come into force next year, is expected to set a salary threshold of \u00a325,600 \u2013 or more in some sectors \u2013 with the aim of halting low-skilled migration.\n\u201cOne thing I really hope this crisis has taught the Conservatives, is that the value of what people do is not always reflected in the salary that they\u2019re paid,\u201d Thomas-Symonds said.\n\u201cWe hear a lot of warm words about our police, the ambulance services, the fire services, our NHS workers, our care workers. But take nurses: when you look at the salary threshold that\u2019s being proposed, nurses, especially when they\u2019re starting off, are below it, and I think the government has to seriously look at how we value people in our society.\u201d\nHe declined to be drawn on what migration system Labour would like to see, saying it would be \u201cfairer\u201d, and that developing it in detail would be an important focus for the party over the next two to three years.\n\u201cIn terms of migration and broad principles, Labour\u2019s an internationalist party. Labour will always believe in the right to live and to work in other countries. Of course we will; also in terms of fairness, and a recognition that the immigration system is about people. It\u2019s not about numbers, it\u2019s not about statistics, it\u2019s about people,\u201d he said, describing the Windrush scandal as a \u201cshameful\u201d episode.\nWhile little known outside Westminster, the 39-year-old has written two biographies of Labour\u2019s great figures \u2013 Aneurin Bevan and Clement Attlee \u2013 and practised as a barrister until becoming an MP in 2015.\nBefore training as a lawyer, he taught politics at Oxford University. \u201cI\u2019ve studied the history of the home secretaries, and my impression is that the really successful home secretaries are strategic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a really strong sense of what their priorities are, and they give a very strong sense of direction, and when that disappears, I think that\u2019s when you start to get into trouble.\u201d\nHe is surprised his Tory opposite number, Priti Patel, has not played a more prominent role during the crisis. Major decisions are being overseen by a \u201cquad\u201d of senior ministers, chaired in the prime minister\u2019s absence by the first secretary, Dominic Raab, and including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove.\nAsked about Patel\u2019s absence from the inner circle, Thomas-Symonds says: \u201cI do think the home secretary should be out on the media regularly, showing her support for our police officers. We want to say them very clearly as politicians, we back what you\u2019re doing and we understand the difficulties.\u201d",

        "content": "On 10 April 1999 the King of Pop turned up and Fulham\u2019s players were not dressed for the occasion when he came in after the match \nOn 10 April 1999, a little under two years since their takeover by Mohamed Al Fayed, Fulham were a third-tier club being propelled remorselessly upwards, running away with the league title \u2013 they were 16 points clear, with seven games to go \u2013 inspired by Kevin Keegan and rocket-fuelled by their owner\u2019s chequebook.\nStill, Keegan apart they were short of superstars. Their record transfer and most famous player was Chris Coleman \u2013 at \u00a32.1m his was the highest fee paid by a third division club, a record beaten only when Sunderland signed Will Grigg 21 years later. The Welsh centre-back was a fine defender but not exactly box office, though they also had the Belgium international Philippe Albert, another centre-back, on loan from Newcastle. Hugh Grant, whose most successful film, Notting Hill, would be premiered in Leicester Square later that month, stood alone as their most famous fan. And then Michael Jackson turned up.\nThe home fixture against Wigan, then seventh in the division, attracted 12,140 to the banks of the Thames and one of them was the King of Pop, whom Fayed coaxed to Craven Cottage after spending the morning showing him around the toy department of Harrods, which the Fulham chairman also owned.\n\u201cI remember warming up, and then Fayed was leading him around the pitch,\u201d the goalkeeper Maik Taylor recalls. \u201cIt was a glorious day, very hot, and he had an umbrella up, waving and clapping the fans. Obviously we paused our warm-up. He did have an aura about him and we were blown away by it all.\u201d\nNot every Fulham player was quite so overwhelmed. Indeed, some didn\u2019t even notice. Speaking to the media after the match, the striker Barry Hayles admitted that \u201cI didn\u2019t find out he was here until we were warming down after the game. I shook his hand and posed for photos with him. He just said: \u2018Good game lads.\u2019\u201d\nMore seasoned football-watchers agreed that it most certainly was not a good game, but Fulham had done well enough to beat a defensive Wigan 2-0. \u201cIt was not a classic and I thought they\u2019d come here with more ambition,\u201d said Keegan. Afterwards Fayed brought his special guest to meet the players.\n\u201cI was about to start my team talk when Mr Fayed marched into the dressing room with a big grin on his face, followed by a tall, rake-thin guy who looked a bit like Michael Jackson,\u201d Keegan \u2013 who seems to remember the visit taking place pre-match \u2013 wrote in his autobiography, My Life in Football. \u201cHe smiled shyly, then I heard him say \u2018Hey\u2019 and it dawned on me that, crikey, this was the real Michael Jackson. It was pointless trying to continue with my team-talk \u2013 the players weren\u2019t listening to a word \u2013 so I walked the King of Pop through the corridors of the old Stevenage Road stand to make him a cup of tea in the players\u2019 lounge.\u201d\n\u201cMost of us were half-naked, having showers, in good spirits because we\u2019d won,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cAl Fayed was a great character and great among the lads in the dressing room. He came in leading Michael Jackson, and his quote, which made us all howl hysterically, as he came in was: \u2018Hide your willies boys.\u2019 He came in and met the guys briefly, then we all agreed to get our clothes on and go back out on to the pitch to have our photos with him.\n\u201cWe all got a signed photo of him with the team \u2013 I don\u2019t have it on the wall or anything, but I\u2019ve still got it. At that point he\u2019s one of most famous guys on the planet. I\u2019m still a fan now of his music \u2013 I\u2019ve been to watch the musical Thriller in London; incredible talent.\u201d\nAfter the game Jackson gave an interview to the Mirror, in which he described Fayed as \u201cvery wise and creative, talented and kind-hearted, very giving\u201d. Though the game, and particularly the scoreless first half, was by no means a thriller the singer seemed impressed.\n\u201cI knew nothing about soccer and I\u2019ve never been to any sporting event, so it was a great experience for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a soccer fan now, definitely. I\u2019m addicted. It was so exciting and passionate \u2013 the fans were like the people who come to my concerts. They were screaming and shouting and cheering their players on. I wanted to jump up and start dancing because I\u2019m used to performing on stage when I hear all that noise. Fulham seemed a really good team with a great spirit. I met all the players and they were so kind to me.\u201d\nFulham were promoted three days later, when they beat Gillingham 3-0, and made it to the top flight in 2001. Jackson never returned to the club (though there was an even more unexpected visit to Exeter City in 2002), but after the singer\u2019s death his visit was commemorated with a controversial statue, which stood outside Craven Cottage for a little under three years before being returned to Fayed in 2013 by Fulham\u2019s new owner, Shahid Khan.\n\u201cI was long gone when the statue arrived,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cBut I still tell people the story of the day I met Jacko. It\u2019s something people aren\u2019t aware of. It was short and sweet, but it was amazing to meet him and that was it, really.\u201d",

Italy announced its record daily death toll of 971 almost two weeks ago, against Spain\u2019s worst day of 950 coronavirus deaths.\nWhile Europe\u2019s worst-hit countries are now past the peak of the outbreak, the UK\u2019s figures are expected to continue to rise for at least two more weeks.\nAnnouncing the fatalities, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cWe never forget that behind this number, behind each one is a name, a loss, and a family that will never be the same again.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThis Easter will be another test of the nation\u2019s resolve. It\u2019s a time of year when people normally come together. But however warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home.\u201d\nThe figures come on the day the global death toll from coronavirus approached 100,000.\nThe UK\u2019s official daily death toll, which is calculated on a different timescale from separate figures announced in all four countries, exceeds Thursday\u2019s daily total of 881 and the previous record tally of 938 announced on Wednesday.\nEarlier on Friday, NHS England confirmed a further 866 hospital deaths, taking England\u2019s total to 8,114. In Scotland, which also counts deaths outside hospitals, there were 48 more deaths making a total of 495. Wales recorded 29 more hospital deaths, taking its total to 315, and there were 10 more deaths in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 92.\nThe figures in England showed a particularly sharp rise in fatalities in the Midlands, where the number of victims rose by more than 84% from 124 to 229 in 24 hours. London remains the worst-hit region with 249 deaths.\nThe patients who died in England were aged between 27 and 100. All but 56 of them had underlying health conditions.\nThe latest data came after it was confirmed that coronavirus had claimed the life of a 10th NHS doctor. Dr Fayez Ayache had retired as a Suffolk GP but had been working part-time in North Clacton, Essex, until three weeks ago. He had also volunteered to help refugees from his native Syria. He died on Wednesday after being diagnosed with pneumonia and Covid-19.\nDr Sharif K Al-Ghazal, a consultant plastic surgeon at Bradford Royal Infirmary, paid tribute on behalf of the Syrian British Medical Society. He said: \u201cDr Fayez was a kind-hearted man who always went out of his way to assist his patients, even at great personal cost.\u201d\nHis daughters Layla and Katie said: \u201cHe was an incredible and amazing doctor having worked as a GP, ENT consultant and surgeon in the NHS and private sector for over 40 years. We are truly devastated and will miss him dearly. He was a true foundation in our lives.\u201d\nAsked how many healthcare workers had died during the crisis at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Hancock passed the question to chief nursing officer Ruth May who said that internal numbers were available for nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and doctors but that it would be \u201cinappropriate for me to go into numbering them\u201d without family permission.\nLike Ayache, all the other nine doctors to have been named as victims of coronavirus have been from BAME backgrounds. They are:\nAbdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, who had pleaded with the prime minister for more PPE.\nSami Shousha, a British-Egyptian doctor who specialised in histopathology, and had worked for more than 40 years at Charing Cross hospital in west London.\nDr Edmond Adedeji, an A&E doctor at the Great Western hospital in Swindon.\nSyed Haider, a British Pakistani retired GP, who had worked at the Valence medical centre in Dagenham, east London.\nAnton Sebastianpillai, a consultant geriatrician who trained in Sri Lanka and died in Kingston hospital, south-west London, just over two weeks after completing his last shift there.\nDr Alfa Saadu, a retired medical director born in Nigeria, who had been volunteering at his local hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire.\nAmged el-Hawrani, an ear, nose and throat consultant of Sudanese descent who was working at Burton hospital near Derby.\nAdil El Tayar, a surgeon from Sudan, who died after volunteering in A&E departments in the Midlands.\nHabib Zaidi, 76, a GP with Pakistani origins, who died after showing \u201ctextbook symptoms\u201d of the virus.",

As concerns over the government\u2019s response have grown, however, the number of people who believe the president is doing a good job appears to be settling back to pre-coronavirus levels.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found approval of Trump\u2019s handling of Covid-19 had dipped to 42%, down from 48% the week before. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating was at 40%, close to where it has been for much of his presidency. According to a survey by CNN, 45% of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s coronavirus response.\nPerhaps more worrying for Trump are his dwindling numbers in a match-up against Joe Biden. CNN found that Biden leads Trump 53% to 42% among registered voters nationwide.\nA number of Trump\u2019s advisers and Republican allies are said to be among those unimpressed with his performance at his press briefings, which have become a daily ritual and often last several hours. Axios and the New York Times reported that a series of senior figures have become dismayed at the briefings, which Trump has used to propagate lies and disinformation about his response to the pandemic.\n\u201cWhite House allies and Republican lawmakers increasingly believe the briefings are hurting the president more than helping him,\u201d the Times reported.\nEven the Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham is among those who wants Trump to rein in his briefings, which frequently run on for more than an hour and regularly feature an upset president lashing out at the press.\nGraham told the New York Times that Trump \u201csometimes drowns out his own message\u201d, and said he had counseled the president to limit the briefings to once a week. Axios reported that Republicans are worried the rambling performances, along with the White House\u2019s wider response to the coronavirus, could harm Trump\u2019s re-election chances.\n\u201cThe next 4-8 weeks is really going to decide whether Trump gets re-elected,\u201d Stephen Moore, a former Trump nominee for Federal Reserve, told Axios.\nThe normally forgiving editorial board of the conservative Wall Street Journal has also come out against Trump\u2019s daily presentations.\n\u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him.\u201d\nDespite the pleas, it seems unlikely that Trump, who is increasingly using the briefings to push out the kind of messaging usually reserved for his campaign rallies, will put a halt to them any time soon.\n\u201cAny suggestion that President Trump is struggling on tone or message is completely false,\u201d the White House spokesman Judd Deere told the New York Times.",

Starting this weekend with four specific intersections, affected streets will be closed to thru-traffic. A list of street closures will be published by Oakland\u2019s department of transportation.\n\u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said on Thursday.\nLike many Californians, Bay Area residents have flooded parks and local beaches since a shelter-in-place order took effect in mid-March, prompting officials to close parks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.\nCity officials hope the slow streets initiative \u2013 which they are calling an emergency measure \u2013 will give residents a safe way to get outdoors for Easter weekend while area parks are restricted, but Schaaf cautioned residents on Friday that the initiative does not mean public health guidance should be ignored.\n\u201cSocial distancing is the only vaccine we have to fight this deadly virus,\u201d Schaff said on Friday.\nThe news was met with resounding applause from local transportation advocates.\nOakland is about to close 74 miles of streets to give people more space for walking and biking with social distance! They\u2019re focusing on bike boulevards - EXACTLY what we\u2019ve asked @CityofBerkeley to do.Sign our petition to support this in Berkeley!! https://t.co/qyphH0lQ89 https://t.co/LiimDFmOtv\nOakland, CA to roll out 74 miles of slow streets for people to walk, run and bike.  #OaklandSlowStreetshttps://t.co/YJQ6veJT2g pic.twitter.com/25xDwTgvFb\nSchaaf asked motorists to adhere to the restrictions and be extra mindful of children on the streets, reminding residents streets will still be open to local traffic. But Schaaf stopped short of enlisting police to enforce the restrictions.\n\u201cWe will not be giving out, at this time, citations,\u201d said the mayor, adding that people have enough to worry about amid a pandemic.\nRoughly 11% of the city\u2019s land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks \u2013 streets and sidewalks make up an additional 20% to 30%, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the expected sunny, holiday weekend.\nThe news was especially welcomein East Oakland, a neighborhood historically overlooked and impoverished, residents said at a press conference about the initiative on Friday. Many East Oakland residents continue to work, despite the shelter-in-place orders, said one community advocate, often walking to their jobs to do so. Any effort to make streets safer is good news for the community, he said.\n\u201cSome of us have to survive and we survive by working,\u201d he said at a Friday press conference. \u201cLiving in East Oakland, every day is an emergency.\u201d",

        "content": "Australia has not yet reached the Covid-19 peak, and experts say if we come out of isolation too early we risk a devastating second wave\nIt is a fundamental problem in fighting a war against an invisible enemy, one that hides among us.\nWhen is the battle over?\nWe know that we are not there yet. That end is months, not weeks away.\nWe know we have not yet reached the \u201cpeak\u201d but that it is coming. Like an invisible wave, we won\u2019t see it when it arrives, we will see only its effects. We have watched it wash over other countries: the grimly climbing toll reported daily, even hourly; the overwhelmed intensive care wards; the shuttered businesses and closed school gates; the empty streets and full mortuaries.\n\u201cThis health crisis and economic crisis is a battle on two fronts,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned, \u201cand it is going to be waged in an unimaginable and unprecedented way over the next at least six months and potentially beyond that.\u201d\nBut it is a balancing act for governments. Weighing lives against livelihoods, the financial imperative to restart shattered economies against the medical necessity to stay home and save lives.\nThe New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has promised her state\u2019s restrictions on work, gathering and movement would be assessed regularly, and flagged they could start to be eased as soon as next month. But it came with this blunt caveat: \u201cEvery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die.\u201d\nAll over the world there is far to go, but restrictions are easing in China, where this Covid-19 outbreak began, and elsewhere planning is under way for a world beyond the pandemic.\nThere will be \u2013 and have been already \u2013 massive economic, societal, environmental and ideological changes wrought by the virus. But right now, the medical questions remain fundamental: when do we know Covid-19 is sufficiently suppressed, how should the restrictions and the lockdowns be eased, and what does a post-Covid world look like?\nThere is danger in complacency. Singapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison, the exemplar of how best to suppress the Covid-19 pandemic, has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 a 60% jump in new daily infections \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions.\nIt will now close all schools and most workplaces \u2013 only essential services such as supermarkets and banks will stay open \u2013 for a full month. It has instituted jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, and banned visitors and transits through the country.\nComparisons between countries are always flawed, too great are the differences in size, development, governance and demographics. Singapore, an island city-state ruled by a single party since independence, with a high-quality public health system and a population broadly adherent to government diktat, was always inherently advantaged.\nJapan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases.\nBut the risk of lifting restrictions too early and unleashing a devastating \u201csecond wave\u201d applies to countries all over the world, and the international community itself.\n\u201cIf Australia comes out of our isolation too early, we risk an even bigger peak,\u201d Associate Prof Ian Mackay from the University of Queensland told the Guardian this week.\n\u201cThis could take six months or more. We cannot lose focus. It\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s very tough for a lot of people, there is real pain and economic hardship in the community. But we have to stick it out, because if we relax too soon, and allow the virus to re-emerge and spread widely, all the pain we have suffered will have been for nothing.\u201d\nThere is historical precedent in Australia too. In the immediate aftermath of world war one, Australia was spared the very worst of the Spanish flu outbreak, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime.\nBut when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April. The third wave, in July, was by far the most deadly.\nThere is an argument that asking \u201cwhen\u201d the restrictions will be lifted is the wrong question. The question that needs to be asked is \u201cwhat?\u201d. What needs to be in place, what needs to have been achieved, before restrictions can be lifted?\nScott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, co-authored a paper with the American Enterprise Institute, proposing a four-phase \u201croad map to re-opening\u201d. The first phase \u2013 in which Australia firmly remains \u2013 is to suppress the spread of the virus as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, to stop the \u201ccurve\u201d from rising to an unmanageable peak that overwhelms public health systems.\nIf there are more critically ill people than there are hospital beds, people who could have been saved will die.\nThis suppression involves physical distancing measures, banning gatherings, closing public spaces and potentially schools, having people work from home, and limiting all travel.\nIn the second phase, individual states, or even cities, would be able to gradually ease certain restrictions, but only when they have built up their capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts.\nThe third phase would allow for remaining restrictions to be lifted when a vaccine is developed, an effective therapy is widely available, or when testing data shows widespread immunity.\nBut there is a fourth stage too. When this pandemic is over \u2013 and it will end \u2013 governments must learn its lessons, and invest heavily in medical research and public health systems. They must prepare for the next one.\nDr Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Kirby Institute, has argued for Australia to impose a \u201cshort, sharp lockdown \u2026 followed by a phased lifting of restrictions\u201d.\n\u201cA short, sharp lockdown of four to eight weeks will improve control of the epidemic in Australia, reduce case numbers more rapidly and bring us to a more manageable baseline from which phased lifting of restrictions and economic recovery can occur. If we fail to do this, we face continued epidemic growth, potential failure of the health system, and a far longer road to recovery.\u201d\nMichael J Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies program, told policymakers each country needs to determine an individual \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d to easing restrictions on movement, travel and work.\nHe said countries need to have come off the \u201cpeak\u201d of infections and have capacity in their healthcare systems \u2013 spare beds in hospitals \u2013 as well as good data on infections, and a low positivity rate, which is the proportion of all samples tested that return positive.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see in somewhere like [South] Korea, they\u2019re testing, and 2% to 6% of their samples are positive. Last week in New York 37% of tested samples were positive. So you need to carefully look at what proportion of people that are tested are positive.\u201d\nBut Ryan stressed that \u201cthere are no absolutes here, there are no answers\u201d.\nA phased lifting of restrictions appears to be Australia\u2019s likely strategy \u2013 \u201csteps and stages that we can test and reverse\u201d, the health minister, Greg Hunt, says.\nThe Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, led by the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, is working on an \u2018exit strategy\u2019 to be presented to government.\nBut Morrison has already forecast a staggered recovery \u2013 a gradual easing of particular restrictions, in certain places, always with the caveat that they may need to be re-imposed if infections again start to rise.\n\u201cYou will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things.\u201d\nTasmania, with fewer cases, and the geographic advantage of being a small island with firmly established biosecurity laws, may be able to move sooner than other states. Those areas hardest hit by Covid-19 cases \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and south-east Queensland \u2013 are likely to be the last to be able to move.\nSouth Australia, with a relatively low number of infections, few hospitalisations, and the highest per capita testing rate in the country, could also be an early mover.\nProf Lyn Gilbert, the chair of the Infection Prevention and Control Expert Advisory Group that reports to the nation\u2019s chief health officers, has warned restrictions could wax and wane with the rate of infections.\n\u201cEveryone wants to know when it will end, and I know the politicians are desperate to be able to say when it will end, but I think we\u2019ve got to be cautious,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think the only way to do it properly is to watch what\u2019s happening and calibrate the response according to what\u2019s happening. And if restrictions were lifted, at least partly, and the numbers started to go up again, they\u2019d probably have to be reimposed.\u201d\nGovernments across the country are bracing their populations for a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you when this is going to end,\u201d the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said this week. \u201cIt is not going to be over in weeks, it is going to be months and months.\u201d\nThere is shrewd political positioning that overlays the medical advice informing this position: better to tell a population to prepare for six months of pain and proscription, and be able to lift it early, than to promise a rapid solution and find yourself apologising, and explaining why it must be extended again.\nAnd Morrison has repeatedly stressed there is no plan yet to ease restrictions anywhere.\n\u201cThere is no map for this. We are in uncharted territory.\u201d\nWuhan, the original centre of the virus, has begun to lift the restrictions on movement after 76 days of near-total lockdown. Movement is now allowed out of the city to the wider Hubei province and beyond.\nAt its peak, Wuhan\u2019s lockdown was extreme: images of doors being welded shut to lock people in their homes shocked the world.\nAuthoritarian regimes are less concerned about curtailing their citizens\u2019 civil liberties and human rights. Liberal democracies find such measures harder to implement: their populations will not tolerate such extreme impositions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to go and cut and paste measures from other places, which have completely different societies. I mean, in China they were welding people\u2019s doors shut,\u201d Morrison told reporters bluntly. \u201cThat might be OK with them, but \u2026 we have different ways of doing things in Australia.\u201d\nChina has been condemned, queried and praised for its response to Covid-19: lauded for its swift and effective lockdown measures; questioned over the veracity of its infection reporting and suppression of information; and excoriated for its failure to adequately warn the world in the initial stages of outbreak and silencing doctors who tried to raise the alarm.\nBut, even as restrictions ease across the world\u2019s most populous nation, freedom there post-Covid is scarcely unrestrained.\nChina\u2019s Health Code app has been downloaded by 700 million people. It is mandatory in some Covid-19-affected areas, such as Wuhan, for even the most fundamental freedoms \u2013 to enter a supermarket, catch a taxi, ride the subway or see a doctor.\nUsers must first fill in their personal details, including their national ID number, where they live and whether they have been in contact with confirmed cases of the virus. The app then gives them a colour-coded rating: green means they are free to travel; yellow mandates seven days quarantine, and red requires 14 days.\nThe app also quietly collects \u2013 and shares with police \u2013 a user\u2019s location and travel data.\nThe \u201cfreedom\u201d provided by this technological development has not been universally welcomed.\n\u201cI thought the days when humans are ruled by machines and algorithms won\u2019t happen for at least another 50 years, one blogger on Zhihu wrote. \u201cThis coronavirus epidemic has suddenly brought it on early.\u201d\nHuman Rights Watch described the Health Code app as \u201cautomated tyranny\u201d.\nSingapore has also used technology to surveil its citizens, pulling together a database of personal details to allow health authorities to track potential Covid-19 carriers. The TraceTogether app sends bluetooth signals to other users, and sends messages to phones warning that a person may have come into contact with a known or suspected case.\nSouth Korea\u2019s mass testing regime and radical transparency have suppressed Covid-19 infections, but at the price of civil liberties. Granular details of new infections and their whereabouts are routinely made public, leading to doxxing of suspected cases \u2013 even speculation of alleged illicit affairs \u2013 and leading the country\u2019s National Human Rights Commission to warn that people infected by the coronavirus face a potential second trauma of harassment, ridicule and social stigma.\nIsrael, Taiwan and Iran have also used mobile phone data to trace potential Covid-19 contacts and monitor its citizens\u2019 movements. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has called for a pan-European mobile app to track the spread of Covid-19 instead of the current miscellany of apps used across the EU that risk breaching people\u2019s privacy.\nIn Britain, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the UK would consider \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d for its population \u2013 medical recognition that a person has had Covid-19 and recovered, and can\u2019t catch it again or spread it. Determined through a serology test for coronavirus antibodies in an individual\u2019s blood, an immunity certificate would authorise a person to return to work and re-enter the community.\n\u201cWe are looking at an immunity certificate,\u201d Hancock said, \u201chow people who have had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity can ... get back as much as possible to normal life.\u201d\nIn Germany too, one of the first countries in Europe to begin to ease restrictions, researchers are preparing a large-scale study into immunity to Covid-19, with a hope it could allow authorities to issue passes to exempt workers from restrictive lockdown measures.\nSuch a certificate could be particularly effective in getting healthcare workers \u2013 disproportionately affected by the virus \u2013 back to work more quickly when they are no longer sick, and no longer at risk of spreading the virus.\nDenmark has also flagged lifting some of its restrictions, forecasting \u201ca gradual and controlled opening of society starting mid-April\u201d.\nPart of Denmark\u2019s plan is to offer widespread testing, not only for the virus, but also for antibodies \u2013 to determine who has immunity, and how widespread immunity is across the community.\nThere are questions, however, over the reliability of serology testing, and whether the presence of antibodies provides long-term immunity.\nAnd there are potential risks. Immunity certificates could create a two-tiered society of those with antibodies and a measure of immunity who are allowed out, and those without who must remain isolated.\nThey could also create a perverse incentive to catch the virus, particularly among demographics for whom the illness is likely \u2013 though not certain \u2013 to be mild. The certificates, too, have the potential to act as a reward to people who have not adhered to physical distancing and who have developed immunity but at the risk to others\u2019 health.\nIn the chaos of the coronavirus, the nation-state has reasserted its dominance in the global order. Country is king.\nThe virus has spread quickly because of the modern world\u2019s breath-taking interconnectivity.\nBut the reaction to this rapid global spread has been its antithesis: national governments and their people have turned inwards, closed borders, told foreign nationals to leave, and relied on national leaders and institutions for guidance through the crisis.\nCountries have formulated and run their responses on strictly national lines. Each country\u2019s \u201ccurve\u201d is compared with others as to whose measures are best (despite the inherent flaws in such comparisons). The national fight is all that most people have the energy for, the looming global calamity is almost beyond contemplation.\nBut the international pandemic must be Australia\u2019s, must be every country\u2019s, concern.\nCovid-19 is no respecter of national borders. Its virulent spread across the world is evidence that the problem is a global one, and so its solutions must be too. It can only be defeated collectively.\n\u201cFortress Australia\u201d might work temporarily \u2013 and Australia has the inherent advantage of being a large island nation-state with borders it can lock down \u2013 but it is not sustainable for a country so dependent upon exports and imports, and a people who travel.\nOther countries, many in Australia\u2019s region, face a far more challenging battle than Australia does. The virus carries the potential of immense suffering.\nMany nations in the Asia-Pacific are densely populated, with developing economies and healthcare systems ill-prepared for the Covid-19 wave to wash over them.\nThe physical distancing enforced by countries around the world, in reality, is a privilege of the rich. Developing nations face the far grimmer choices in choosing to lock its populations down to keep them alive or allowing them to work in order to survive.\nHundreds of millions of daily wage labourers in India \u2013 a country under total lockdown \u2013 don\u2019t eat if they don\u2019t work.\nPakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has warned his country cannot enact the distancing measures it needs to without people starving.\nThere are other challenges too.\nIndonesia, late to the fight against Covid-19, now finds itself battling the virus blind, because it doesn\u2019t have adequate testing. And Pacific nations are braced for the potential devastation of a virus sweeping through small close-knit communities, isolated from tertiary health care.\nVanuatu, already on high alert for a Covid-19 outbreak, bore the brunt of yet another category 5 cyclone this week, a reminder that climate-influenced catastrophes remain ever-present in Australia\u2019s region.\nHumanity\u2019s other grave challenges have not been eradicated, only momentarily obscured, by the Covid-19 crisis.\nEven if Australia succeeds in bending its Covid-19 infection curve to its will \u2013 which is at this point unusual for an Anglophone country \u2013 there will be more to do internationally before restrictions such as travel bans can be lifted.\nAustralia\u2019s success in defeating Covid-19 will depend on its willingness to help other countries less able to defeat it too.\nYou can never be safe from a virus if you are surrounded by it.",

        "content": "Personal protective equipment is a priority for vulnerable older Australians, but some suppliers are charging double\nNot-for-profit aged care providers say corporate suppliers of personal protective equipment are gouging them on prices, in one case doubling the cost of masks and gowns.\nThe aged care sector, like many healthcare services, has struggled to access PPE due to global shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe federal government has made it a clear priority to get government-held PPE reserves to residential aged care facilities where confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been recorded, given the vulnerability of older Australians.\nOther providers, where an outbreak has not yet been recorded, are being warned of significant delays in accessing the government stockpile.\nNow, aged care providers are also reporting price-gouging by their normal commercial suppliers.\nAged and Community Services Australia (ACSA), the peak body for not-for-profit aged care providers, says it is aware of corporate suppliers making significant \u201cprice hikes\u201d on PPE.\nIn one case, a supplier had more than doubled the cost of a box of masks from $9.60 to $22.50, and hiked the price of a box of gowns from $90 to $175, ACSA said.\n\u201cAt a time when we need to ensure the safety and wellness of the vulnerable older people we care for, and the staff who are caring for them, we find price-gouging for essential products unacceptable,\u201d ACSA chief executive Patricia Sparrow said.\nThe federal government has been attempting to boost stocks of PPE in Australia by procuring more from abroad, ramping up domestic production at existing supplier Med-Con, and releasing additional supplies from the national medical stockpile.\nA wide range of businesses are also pivoting into PPE production, including 3D printers, distilleries, and food packaging companies.\nHealth minister Greg Hunt this week announced 11m new masks would be allocated to health workers, including 1.7m for aged care workers.\nMasks were particularly urgent for parts of the aged care sector that had experienced an outbreak, Hunt said.\nInitial difficulties in PPE access for the sector were addressed by giving providers a direct line to the federal health department to request supplies from the national medical stockpile.\nWithin two weeks of that direct line opening, 80 aged care providers that either had confirmed Covid-19 cases or were facing \u201csevere risk\u201d to their ability to function asked for access to supplies from the emergency stockpile.\nThe Council on the Ageing (Cota) has reported that those receiving home care have been turning away support workers due to Covid-19-related fears.\nCota Australia chief executive Ian Yates said carers were being turned away even in circumstances where they didn\u2019t need to be wearing PPE. Yates said the consequences of not receiving care were serious in many cases.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t over-exaggerate it, but it\u2019s not uncommon, because there\u2019s so much fear,\u201d he told the Guardian last week.\nThe federal government has since issued guidelines on when home care workers need to wear PPE.",

Shows of good faith on both sides of the negotiating table helped smooth the process, with the club\u2019s vice-chair, Karren Brady, and the manager, David Moyes, accepting 30% deferrals and the owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, deferring interest payments on shareholder loans.\nIt emerged earlier this week that West Ham plan to do a rights issue to raise at least \u00a330m next month, laying bare the consequences of the coronavirus crisis forcing the suspension of English football last month. The club made a proposal suggesting the players accept 30% deferrals on Thursday. It is believed that the players, who have been led by their captain, Mark Noble, have agreed a lower percentage, albeit one higher than the 10% deferral Southampton\u2019s squad agreed earlier this week.\nNegotiations over pay have rumbled throughout the Premier League since the postponement of the season. However, attempts to reach a collective agreement over 30% deferrals across the league reached a dead end last weekend, forcing clubs to go it alone. Manchester City are also understood to be in talks with their players over deferrals.\nFour top-flight clubs \u2013 Bournemouth, Newcastle, Norwich and Tottenham \u2013 have placed non-playing staff on furlough. However, West Ham have continued to pay full-time and casual staff in full.\nBrady said: \u201cI would like to say a big thank you to David Moyes and his backroom team, our captain Mark Noble and our fantastic squad of players for the commitment and determination they have shown to offer their help and support. I would also like to thank the shareholders whose support through this injection of equity once again demonstrates their commitment to the future of the Club.\u201d\nNoble said: \u201cAs players we have been in constant dialogue with the Club since the situation around Covid-19 emerged and I am proud that our entire squad have made clear their strong desire to play our part in helping to support others through this situation.\u201d",

WHO wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone,\u201d he told a virtual press conference in Geneva. \u201cAt the same time, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence. The way down can be as dangerous as the way up if not managed properly.\u201d\nAmerica\u2019s top infectious disease expert also cautioned against moves to relax restrictions, echoing calls from other global public health officials but putting him at odds with Donald Trump, who is agitating for a reopening of the coronavirus-battered US economy.\nAnthony Fauci said \u201cnow is not the time to back off\u201d on restrictions, despite what he described as \u201cfavourable signs\u201d in America\u2019s early hotspots.\n\u201cWe would want to see a clear indication that you were very, very clearly and strongly going in the right direction, because the one thing you don\u2019t want to do is you don\u2019t want to get out there prematurely and then wind up back in the same situation,\u201d the senior adviser to the White House told CNN.\nTrump, seemingly concerned by deflating approval ratings and exploding unemployment figures, had told reporters that he hoped to open up the economy \u201cvery, very, very, very soon\u201d.\nOn Friday, the president struck a more emollient tone, saying he would announce next week a council of business and medical leaders to help him with the \u201cbiggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d on when to reopen America for business.\nTrump added: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great ... The facts are going to determine what I do. But we do want to get the country open.\u201d\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, the US president wants to reopen the country next month despite concerns from both economists and health experts that America\u2019s coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near over.\nNancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, also warned Trump against trying to get back to normality prematurely. \u201cI would hope that the scientific community would weigh in and say, \u2018You can\u2019t do this, it is only going to make matters worse if you go out too soon,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said in an interview with Politico.\nUS deaths owing to the coronavirus topped 17,000 on Friday, although there were signs that Americans staying home was curbing new infections. More than 7,000 people have died in New York State alone, but its governor, Andrew Cuomo, expressed cautious optimism on Friday that the state\u2019s infection rate was slowing.\nIn the latest sign of tensions with the US, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, criticised the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the outbreak as too slow.\nIn a preview of an interview for Der Spiegel, Maas took aim at the two extremes of national coronavirus responses, contrasting China\u2019s \u201cvery authoritarian measures\u201d with America\u2019s decision to play down the threat \u201cfor a very long time\u201d.\n\u201cThese are two extremes, neither of which can be a model for Europe,\u201d Maas said.\nA German official last week accused the US of \u201cwild west\u201d tactics in outbidding for or blocking shipments of vital medical supplies, and Maas said he hoped the US would rethink its international relationships in light of the crisis.\n.\nIn Asia, China weighed in on a growing row between the WHO and Taiwan, accusing Taiwan\u2019s government of \u201cunscrupulously using the virus to seek independence\u201d.\nThe WHO and Taiwan have been trading accusations in recent days, largely stemming from Taiwan\u2019s continued exclusion from the body\u2019s membership and activities because of lobbying by China, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory. Earlier this week Tedros said he had been subjected to months of racist attacks which he said were condoned by Taiwan. Taiwan says the accusations are groundless and has demanded an apology.\nIn Europe, Italian newspapers reported that the government was poised to extend confinement measures due to expire on 13 April to 3 May. Officials are using helicopters, drones and stepped-up police checks to make sure people don\u2019t slip out of their homes over the Easter holiday.\nSpain\u2019s lockdown, which came into force on 14 March, will also remain in place, its health minister said on Friday. But some non-essential workers will begin returning to their jobs on Monday at the end of a two-week freeze on all non-vital economic activity, despite warnings that the relaxation of the strict confinement policy could drive a rise in contagion.\nIn other developments:\nThe first confirmed case was announced in war-torn Yemen, stoking fears of an outbreak that could devastate its already crippled healthcare system.\nIn the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, there was a crush as people desperate for food because the coronavirus restrictions have kept them from making a living pushed through a gate at a district office in the Kibera slum.\nFifty crew aboard France\u2019s only aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, tested positive and parts of the ship have been put in lockdown. An armed forces\u2019 ministry statement said that three sailors had been evacuated by air to a military hospital in Toulon on the south coast, the home port of the carrier. The aircraft carrier, which is equipped with its own intensive care facilities, has 1,760 personnel on board.\nA Yanomami teenager became the first indigenous person to die from the virus in Brazil. Meanwhile the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, one of only a handful of global leaders still denying the virus threat, was booed and jeered in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, after he went to a bakery for a doughnut.",

The Baltimore institution says at least 1,681,964 people have been infected, while 374,509 have recovered.\nThe French death toll passed 13,000, the health ministry director J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon said. A further 554 deaths were confirmed in French hospitals and 433 in care and retirement homes.\nRestrictions will remain in place in Italy for another three weeks, the country\u2019s prime minister has said, although a few types of shop will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday. Giuseppe Conte said: \u201cThis is a difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility.\u201d\nThe US president said he is creating a second taskforce that will include a council tasked with deciding when to ease restrictions. But Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed the idea, insists he is not determined to reopen the economy if he is advised that to do so would endanger public health.\nTurkey has put in place a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara and other major cities, its interior ministry said, adding that the curbs will begin at midnight and end at the same time on Sunday. The country\u2019s known death toll stands at 1,006 people.\nKenny Dalglish tested positive for the virus while in hospital for treatment on a separate infection, his family announced.\nThe 69-year-old former player and manager was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for a course of intravenous antibiotics and, in line with current procedures, underwent a test for Covid-19 despite displaying no symptoms of the illness.\nThe government must urgently look into if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, the head of the British Medical Association said, after it emerged that the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME.\nThe country recorded 980 deaths in a day, the worst such toll since the outbreak began, taking the cumulative total of those who have died in hospitals to 8,958. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said about 19,000 tests are being carried out each day.\nThe UK prime minister has been \u201cable to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery\u201d, Downing Street said. Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit on Thursday.\nHancock said the government is issuing guidance on who needs personal protective equipment and who does not, adding that it will only be used when there is a clinical need. He promised that equipment will be distributed to hospitals daily from next week and production and imports will be increased for the future.\nMinisters have come under increasing pressure over their continued failure to provide all health workers with the means to protect themselves.",

And why did this happen to me?\u201d\nBut he said that \u201ca fundamental difference between God-fearers and secularists today is found in the approach to suffering\u201d. Pell used his imprisonment to further the point.\n\u201cI have just spent 13 months in jail for a crime I didn\u2019t commit, one disappointment after another,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI knew God was with me, but I didn\u2019t know what He was up to, although I realised He has left all of us free,\u201d Pell wrote. \u201cBut with every blow it was a consolation to know I could offer it to God for some good purpose like turning the mass of suffering into spiritual energy.\u201d\nPell wrote that the sexual abuse crisis damaged thousands of victims and that \u201cfrom many points of view the crisis is also bad for the Catholic church\u201d.\nVictoria police charged Pell after a man, known as Witness J, came forward in 2014 alleging he and another choirboy were abused at St Patrick\u2019s cathedral in Melbourne in 1996.\nWitness J, now in his 30s, said he had felt compelled to come forward after the death of the other choirboy.\nPell was convicted by a jury in December 2018. An earlier jury was unable to reach a verdict. Pell appealed his conviction, first unsuccessfully in Victoria\u2019s court of appeal, but then successfully in the high court.\nFollowing the high court\u2019s ruling, Witness J issued a statement in which he accepted the decision and acknowledged that child sexual abuse was difficult to prove to the standard required by the courts.\nBut he also issued a rallying cry to other survivors.\n\u201cI would hate to think that one outcome of this case is that people are discouraged from reporting to the police,\u201d he said.\nThe Pell matter is still the subject of a civil claim.\nThe father of the now deceased choirboy is suing the Catholic church and has pledged to continue the case following the quashing of Pell\u2019s conviction.\n\u201cWe will continue to pursue a civil claim on behalf of our client despite the high court\u2019s ruling,\u201d the man\u2019s lawyer, Lisa Flynn from Shine Lawyers, said. \u201cHe has suffered immensely and maintains George Pell was responsible for his son\u2019s sudden downward spiral after he abused his son as a young choirboy.\u201d\nIn his Easter message, the cardinal also said Christians were better able to deal with the suffering of the coronavirus pandemic. He described it as a unique moment for people of his generation and younger.\n\u201cSo, too, some would see Covid-19 as a bad time for those who claim to believe in a good and rational God, the Supreme Love and Intelligence, the Creator of the universe,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is a mystery; all suffering, but especially the massive number of deaths through plagues and wars.

In the other, TV hosts are urging the opposite\n\u201cI would say without question it\u2019s the biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make,\u201d Donald Trump said on Friday, contemplating when and how he will relax physical distancing guidelines and reopen the American economy.\nIn one ear, he has medical experts pleading caution. In the other, Fox News urges the opposite.\nThe conservative TV network has been widely condemned for downplaying the threat of Covid-19 even as it took measures to protect its own staff. And with the projected death toll poised to avoid the worst-case scenario, some hosts are resuming their gung-ho attitude.\n\u201cAt some point, the president is going to have to look at Drs Fauci and Birx and say, we\u2019re opening on May 1,\u201d Laura Ingraham tweeted this week. \u201cGive me your best guidance on protocols, but we cannot deny our people their basic freedoms any longer.\u201d\nTomi Lahren, a host on Fox Nation, added bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s time to start the reopen of America.\u201d\nThe symbiotic relationship between the Trump administration and Fox News has long been chronicled. Ideas and personnel move back and forth. The president is a regular interviewee and the host Sean Hannity once spoke at a Trump rally.\nIndeed, on some occasions Fox News echoes, amplifies and refines Trump\u2019s message, while on others the president takes his cue from its programming.\nSean Spicer, a host on the conservative Newsmax channel and former Trump White House press secretary, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question about it that he watches a lot of Fox and you can tell by the tweets and the comments and his actions. He\u2019ll tweet out, \u2018I just saw on Fox & Friends\u2019 or \u2018Hannity segment tonight\u2019. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a debatable point. I don\u2019t think the White House would debate that. I hope not.\u201d\nBut when the coronavirus outbreak began, the stakes rose. While Fox News reporters did cover it, some opinion hosts rhymed with Trump in comparing it to flu and accusing liberals of whipping up hysteria. On 3 March, Jesse Watters, a co-host of The Five, boasted: \u201cYou want to know how I really feel about the coronavirus, Juan? If I get it, I\u2019ll beat it \u2026 I\u2019m not afraid of the coronavirus and no one else should be that afraid either.\u201d\nWatters later admitted he was wrong, but this and remarks from Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and other Fox News and conservative media stars will live in infamy in a video compilation produced by The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, under the title: \u201cSaluting the Heroes of the Coronavirus Pandumbic\u201d.\nWhat effect did these comments have? Four in five Fox News viewers surveyed by Pew Research said they believed the media had exaggerated the risks of the virus. An open letter to Fox Corporation\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, and chief executive, Lachlan Murdoch, signed by 74 journalism professors and leading journalists, described Fox News misinformation as \u201ca danger to public health\u201d.\nIt argued: \u201cAs the virus spread across the world, Fox News hosts and guests minimized the dangers, accusing Democrats and the media of inflating the dangers (in Sean Hannity\u2019s words) to \u2018bludgeon Trump with this new hoax\u2019. Such commentary encouraged Donald Trump to trivialize the threat and helped obstruct national, state and local efforts to limit the coronavirus.\u201d\nHannity was unrepentant. He told Newsweek: \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d\nSome of the Trump old guard, such as Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, were quicker to recognise the virus could not be wished away. On 7 March Carlson delivered a warning in person to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. On 9 March he told Fox News viewers: \u201cPeople you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimising what is clearly a very serious problem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just partisan politics, they say: \u2018Calm down. In the end, this is just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass, and when it does, we will feel foolish for worrying about it.\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s their position. But they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\nOn 13 March Trump declared a national emergency, and soon after called himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d. Hannity and others fell into line, denying they had ever sought to downplay the virus.\nDan Cassino, a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University and author of Fox News and American Politics: How One Channel Shapes American Politics and Society, said: \u201cSome of the primetime shows have been better at shaping [Trump] than others. Hannity is all about repeating what the president says.\n\u201cHannity isn\u2019t leading him except sometimes on rhetoric: he\u2019s very good at taking what Trump is saying and making it fit the mould of conservatism. Tucker Carlson has been more effective on pushing him into certain positions. We saw it on the air and, according to reports, in a personal capacity.\u201d\nIt did not take long for conservative media to backslide. Predictive models now suggest the final US death toll could be around 60,000, staggering by any measure, but significantly lower than a projection on 31 March of between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths.\nSeveral hosts on Fox News and elsewhere have floated the conspiracy theory that the numbers might be exaggerated, using unrelated medical conditions in an effort to paint Trump in a negative light in an election year. Even Carlson said: \u201cThere may be reasons people seek an inaccurate death count. When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u201d\nCarlson has also suggested the crisis \u201cmay have passed\u201d, even as America approaches half a million cases amid hellish scenes of crowded hospitals and island burials in New York. The right has also attacked Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, fitting a longstanding narrative that derides experts and the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d. And there has been cheerleading for Trump\u2019s promotion of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that is unproven for treating coronavirus.\nFederal guidelines on physical distancing expire on 30 April. Trump is hurtling towards a life-and-death decision on whether to extend them or, with millions of jobs already lost, at least partly restart the economy. He promised on Friday: \u201cI will look at both sides of the argument.\u201d But could Fox News tilt the balance again?\nSidney Blumenthal, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \u201cFox News bears major responsibility for the vulnerability of the public to coronavirus and the fatalities, just as Trump does. Trump has said that he\u2019s not responsible. He is, and so is Fox News. They are linked together in responsibility for the consequences of coronavirus.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a moral dimension that flows from irresponsibility on which you have put hundreds of millions of people at risk for their lives, not only heedless but knowingly. But the idea that Rupert Murdoch, any more than Donald Trump, could be shamed by their moral culpability is dealing in the fantastic.\u201d",

        "content": "The once ubiquitous electric float had seen its power wane. Then came the pandemic\nThe humble milkman \u2013 a regular sight on most British streets throughout the 20th century \u2013 was almost consigned to the history books by the rise of the supermarkets.\nBut now, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, these dairy deliverers on their electric floats are busier than ever as they try to keep up with newfound demand for their services.\nDairies are reporting a boom in customer numbers, with some recruiting hundreds of milkmen and women to help deal with the extra workload as shoppers try to reduce, or forgo, their trips to supermarkets.\nScott Hughes, owner of Jackson\u2019s Dairies in Stockport, which sources all its milk from farmers in the Peak District, said he first noticed an upsurge in orders when the virus hit China in January. Since then, the \u201cphones have not stopped ringing\u201d.\n\u201cIt was just phenomenal \u2013 all of a sudden we were inundated,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cOur doorstep canvasser went out and within 40 minutes he had signed up 30 new customers \u2013 this would normally take him days.\u201d\nSince the outbreak, Hughes\u2019s firm, which has been delivering milk since the 1950s, has seen an 83% rise in business \u2013 signing up more than 800 new customers in two weeks. Another 300 customers are on a waiting list.\n\u201cOver the years, we experienced a steady decline and when we looked at it, it was always to do with price because we struggled to compete with supermarket prices,\u201d Hughes said.\n\u201cBut with this virus, and also a growing concern about the environment, we are starting to see a shift in the way people shop.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cCustomers have been ringing 24/7 and it is not just elderly people, there is a complete variety \u2013 young people, people with children. We are just hoping when this is all over those customers will stay with us because they will have felt the benefits of having milk delivered to their home.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the country\u2019s largest milk and groceries doorstep delivery service, Milk & More, is currently suspending new customer sign-ups, after reporting an increase of 25,000 customers. It has begun a recruitment campaign for 100 milk deliverers.\nThe firm\u2019s chief executive, Patrick M\u00fcller, said: \u201cWe have been at the heart of the communities in which we serve for decades, but potentially we have never had such an important role as we do now in this current health crisis.\u201d\nColin Henderson, from Chester-le-Street in Durham, who has been delivering milk for 40 years, said: \u201cThe milk has gone berserk.\u201d\nHenderson said 60% of his customers were pensioners, and they enjoyed having regular contact with him. He is now wearing plastic gloves when he drops his milk, shakes and juices off on the doorstep.\nHe added: \u201cI have got a pile of notes from customers and my round is taking an extra hour every day now. The dairy I work with said it is just manic \u2026 I just hope that after this is finished that people stay with us.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s remaining milk delivery companies have been forced to adapt in recent years, and online orders have replaced rolled-up notes inside used bottles. Many have diversified by adding grocery items to deliveries, from bread, bacon and eggs to toilet roll and even compost.\nTrade association Dairy UK said 89% of all milk bought in Britain in 1980 was on the doorstep but many firms closed because of changing consumer habits, and cheaper competition from supermarkets.\nIn the mid-1990s, just 30% of milk was still delivered, falling to 2.8% in 2015 with many of the customers mainly elderly people.\nGrowing consumer concern about plastic waste has led to a gentle increase in demand in recent years for doorstep deliveries of the reusable bottles. But the slight upward curve has now become mountainous.\nDr Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK, said many of its members had seen huge increases in demand for milk deliveries as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\u201cMany have taken on as many new customers as they are able to, and are working round the clock to get milk to as many homes as they can,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe know that milkmen and women are providing vital lifelines to older or more vulnerable consumers who are not able to leave their homes due to the restrictions, providing milk and other goods to those who need it, safely.\u201d",

        "content": "Are state responses to the virus shifting the balance of power between China and the west?\nAndr\u00e0 tutto bene, the Italians have taught us to think, but in truth, will everything be better the day after? It may seem premature, in the midst of what Emmanuel Macron has described as \u201ca war against an invisible enemy\u201d, to consider the political and economic consequences of a distant peace. Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes.\nYet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion.\nAlready everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted \u201cthis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be a return to the day before, we will be stronger morally. We will draw the consequences, all the consequences.\u201d He has promised to start with major health investment. A Macronist group of MPs has already started a Jour d\u2019Apr\u00e8s website.\nIn Germany, the former Social Democratic party foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has lamented that \u201cwe talked the state down for 30 years\u201d, and predicts the next generation will be less naive about globalisation. In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: \u201cThere can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.\u201d Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said: \u201cThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. Covid-19 is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.\u201d\nThe discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world.\nIn the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly searched for vindication in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner. Indeed, to be \u201ca nation of shopkeepers\u201d, the great Napoleonic insult, no longer looks so bad.\nThe obvious and widely drawn parallel has been, as so often in Britain, the second world war. In The Road to 1945, Paul Addison\u2019s definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September 1944: \u201cNo excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don\u2019t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we\u2019ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We\u2019ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn\u2019t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.\u201d\nIn the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish clapping on doorsteps, all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval.\nIn Europe, the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate \u2013 the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism.\nIt is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments\u2019 handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake. Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.\nThe Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: \u201cFor now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency \u2013 one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat Covid-19, and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it.\n\u201cThe crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.\u201d\nMany are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives. The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in an influential essay in El Pa\u00eds, has argued the victors are the \u201cAsian states like Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore that have an authoritarian mentality which comes from their cultural tradition [of] Confucianism. People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.\u201d\nHe predicts: \u201cChina will now be able to sell its digital police state as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.\u201d He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties. There is little liberty in being forced to spend spring shut in your own flat.\nIndeed, China is already on a victory lap of sorts, believing it has deftly repositioned itself from the culprit to the world\u2019s saviour. A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country\u2019s superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of \u201cshamelessly trying to capitalise on the country\u2019s \u2018victory against the virus\u2019 to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of Covid-19.\u201d\nThe Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take to Foreign Policy magazine, he suggests: \u201cCoronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east. South Korea and Singapore have shown the best response and China has managed well in the aftermath of its initial mistakes. The governments\u2019 response in Europe and the US has been very sceptical and likely to weaken the power of the western brand.\u201d\nMany on the European left, such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, also fear an authoritarian contagion, predicting in the west \u201ca new barbarism with a human face \u2013 ruthless survivalist measures enforced with regret and even sympathy, but legitimised by expert opinions\u201d.\nBy contrast, Shivshankar Menon, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in India, says: \u201cExperience so far shows that authoritarians or populists are no better at handling the pandemic. Indeed, the countries that responded early and successfully, such as Korea and Taiwan, have been democracies \u2013 not those run by populist or authoritarian leaders.\u201d\nFrancis Fukuyama concurs: \u201cThe major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other. The crucial determinant in performance will not be the type of regime, but the state\u2019s capacity and, above all, trust in government.\u201d He has praised Germany and South Korea.\nSouth Korea is in fact selling itself as the democratic power, in contrast to China, that has best handled the crisis. Its national press is full of articles on how Germany is following the South Korean model of mass testing.\nBut South Korea, an export-oriented economy, also faces long-term difficulties if the pandemic forces the west, as Prof Joseph Stiglitz predicts, into a total reassessment of the global supply chain. He argues the pandemic has revealed the drawbacks of concentrating production of medical supplies. As a result, just-in-time imports will go down and production of domestically sourced goods will go up. South Korea may gain kudos, but lose markets.\nThe loser at the moment, apart from those like Steve Bannon who argued for \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state\u201d, risks being the EU.\nSome of Europe\u2019s most scathing critics have been the pro-Europeans. Nicole Gnesotto, the vice-president of the Jacques Delors Institute thinktank, says: \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of preparations, its powerlessness, its timidity are staggering. Of course, health is not part of its competency, but it is not without means or responsibility.\u201d The first instinct was to close borders, hoard equipment and assemble national responses. In times of scarcity it emerged every person was for themself, and Italy felt most left to itself.\nBut the dispute has widened into an ugly battle between north and south Europe over the isssuance of common debt, or the conditions that could be set for any credit issued by the eurozone bailout fund. The Dutch and Germans suspect Italy is using the crisis in Lombardy to rebrand the rejected concept of eurobonds in which the north finances the debts of the feckless south. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is pushing the issue, telling the bloc \u201cit has an appointment with history\u201d. If the EU fails, it could fall apart, he has warned.\nThe Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, spoke of \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cpetty\u201d comments by the Dutch minister Wopke Hoekstra, while the Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, wondered whether the Dutch understood that \u201ca first-class cabin would not protect you when the whole ship sinks\u201d.\nThe former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has been scathing about Dutch resistance to helping Italy, telling the Dutch press that the Italian view of the Netherlands has been seriously damaged: \u201cIt did not help that a day after German customs officials stopped a huge amount of masks at the border, Russian trucks carrying relief supplies drove through the streets of Rome and millions of masks were sent from China. Matteo Salvini is waiting for this type of action from the Netherlands and Germany so that he can say: you see, we have no use for the European Union.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s position is not irretrievable. Salvini\u2019s closure agenda has not yet found its footing, since Conte\u2019s popularity does not make the prime minister an easy target. Conte has become the single most popular leader in the history of the Italian republic. Individual German politicians, such as Marian Wendt, have also undone some of the damage by organising for a group of Italians to be flown from Bergamo to Cologne for treatment.\nBut with the death toll mounting across Europe, and the crisis just starting to penetrate Africa, the EU discourse so far has been dominated by an unedifying and highly technical row about how to fund the EU\u2019s economic rescue.\nEurope\u2019s chief solace is to look across the Atlantic and watch the daily chaos that is Donald Trump\u2019s evening press conference \u2013 the daily reminder that rational people can plan for anything, except an irrational president. Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, wonders whether, much like the 1956 Suez crisis symbolised the ultimate decay of the UK\u2019s global power, coronavirus could mark the \u201cSuez moment\u201d for the US.\nBorrell himself insists the EU is finding its feet after a rocky start and the case for cooperation is being won. Writing in Project Syndicate, he claims: \u201cAfter a first phase of diverging national decisions, we are now entering a phase of convergence in which the EU takes centre stage. The world initially met the crisis in an uncoordinated fashion, with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone. It is now clear that the only way out of it is together.\u201d\nHe may be proved right, but at the moment the scales are evenly balanced. There is, as yet, a world still to be won.",

        "content": "Coronavirus outbreak dashes hopes of winemakers in Burgundy \nIn the village of Maligny in the valley of the Serein river at the heart of chablis country, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bordet surveys the vineyards his family has owned since 1590.\nSpring, when the vines sprout their first leaves, is an uncertain time, when late frosts threaten to kill off early growth. Like other vignerons in this region of Burgundy, Bordet has been working day and night to protect his plants, a number of which are more than 100 years old.\nIn the last four years, chablis wine producers have had only one full grape harvest, in 2018. In 2016, the vines were damaged by hail, in 2017 by frost, and last year by frost and drought.\nBordet, a man who admits he sees the glass as half full, says he and his fellow vine growers had high hopes for 2020. That was before the coronavirus struck.\nToday, the weather is just one of their worries. With bars, restaurants and brasseries closed in France and the UK \u2013 his biggest market \u2013 because of the lockdown, Burgundy winemakers are facing another bad year. The pallets in Bordet\u2019s warehouse are stacked up and marked for delivery to the UK, but new orders have dried up.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working and paying staff but at the same time we\u2019re selling nothing,\u201d Bordet says. \u201cNot knowing if and when sales will pick up is psychologically very difficult.\u201d\nBordet has 20 hectares (50 acres) of vines on the sloping right bank of the Serein facing a perfect south/south-east, from which he produces about 130,000 bottles a year.\nThis is the historical site of the birth of chablis. The soil, rich from the Kimmeridgian (late Jurassic) period 80m years ago, is made of white clay, limestone and fossilised oysters from a time the area was sea, giving chablis \u2013 100% made from chardonnay grapes \u2013 its unique flavour.\nChablis is classified under four Appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) designations, the system of French certification: grand cru and premier cru at the top, followed by chablis and petit chablis.\nBordet, who produces six different chablis from his vineyards, including a grand cru and two premiers crus, has spent the last few nights soaking his vines with cold water to protect them from the frost.\nThe water produces heat as it freezes over the sprouting leaves and keeps them at zero so that they are not damaged by the frost, he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work, but we have to keep going. Nature isn\u2019t stopped by the coronavirus.\n\u201cWe can hope there will be a big party when the lockdown is over and business will pick up. Right now we can do nothing except look after our vines.\u201d\nThe grower\u2019s Domaine S\u00e9guinot Bordet label sells 6-7m bottles of chablis to the UK each year \u2013 roughly a third of its sales. This year, the salons and tastings that produce orders have all been cancelled, as well as an important d\u00e9gustation next month in London hosted by 40 chablis winemakers.\nThe entrance to the village of Chablis, on the shortlist for this year\u2019s prettiest place in France title, is marked by a large sculpture of a hand holding a bunch of unnaturally golden grapes.\nThrough the village, the road to Maligny is a gently rolling landscape dotted with parallel lines of stumpy vines where frowning, weathered vignerons are inspecting plants for growth and damage, ploughing out weeds and repairing trellises.\nBordet, 45, president of the chablis committee of the BIVB (the Bourgogne wine board), remembers walking the family\u2019s vineyards with his grandfather when he was five, and the huge village dinner and parties when the harvest was brought in, picked by hand in those days, rather than mechanically as it is now.\n\u201cI miss that time of f\u00eate after the harvest. There was a meal, games, dances \u2013 it was very festive. But it would take 50-70 people to pick the grapes by hand and already there\u2019s a shortage of people to work,\u201d he says.\nChablis winemakers now struggle to find workers, he said. \u201cWe need around 300-400 people, but youngsters nowadays don\u2019t want to do this kind of work. It is hard, you are outside in all weather, rain, cold and shine. But at least you\u2019re out in the country, in nature.\n\u201cIn France we have scorned manual jobs for too long, but doing a job like this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not intelligent.\u201d\nAlberic Bichot is the sixth generation to work the family domaines, which produce internationally recognised burgundy wines mostly in Beaune, to the south of Chablis, where he also has a vineyard. He says the region\u2019s winemakers have built up less stock than their Bordeaux cousins, for whom this year will be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d.\nHe says, however, that with \u201cBrexit, Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose a 25% import tax on French wine and now the virus \u2026 we will suffer\u201d.\nBichot added: \u201cSome of the big UK supermarkets are still ordering wine, but with all the restaurants, hotels and bars closed, the orders are drying up.\n\u201cThere are worrying times ahead. But we Bourguignons are lucky in that we can keep our spirits up looking after the vines in the hope that everything will one day return to normal. At least we are outside, not cooped up in a small apartment or producing something that will rot if not sold.\u201d\nFor the winemakers, however, even hard work brings no guarantees, says Bordet. \u201cNothing is certain; as we have seen in recent years, sometimes it\u2019s too hot, sometimes too cold, or there\u2019s too much rain or too little rain, or frost and hail \u2026 But we\u2019re optimists. We have to be.\u201d",

        "content": "With dozens of fatalities linked to \u2018floating Petri dishes\u2019, shares have collapsed \u2013 but all may not be lost\nLike many thousands of nurses, Julie Timson has spent the past few weeks suited up in an armour of personal protective equipment fighting the coronavirus and trying to save lives.\nIn the moments when it\u2019s too overwhelming on the ward, Timson takes a minute to daydream about sipping cocktails on a cruise ship floating in some ocean paradise destination.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\n\u201cI am a cruise fan,\u201d said Timson, who has worked as a nurse for decades. \u201cI have done several cruises a year and have one booked this year in August and I\u2019m forever hoping it will still go.\u201d\nTimson, a widow who enjoys the sociability of cruising, said she cannot wait to get back out on deck, even though cruise ships have been branded the \u201cfloating Petri dishes\u201d of Covid-19.\nDozens of fatalities have been linked to cruise ships, with passengers and crew dying while at sea and after disembarking. More than 6,300 passengers are still onboard eight ships unable to dock as governments block disembarkation, fearing it will spread the disease.\nImportant update for guests on select future sailings. pic.twitter.com/5hm35dF8DW\nSome travel industry experts fear the cruise holiday business may never recover from coronavirus and shares in cruise companies have collapsed. Governments across the world have banned new cruises setting sail for months and some sailings have been suspended until at least November 2020.\nBut the analysts may be underestimating the desire of people like Timson to get back on board regardless. On dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to cruise ships, the number of people bemoaning the fact that they cannot continue cruising greatly outnumbers those worrying about the pandemic.\nRuth Bowe, 29, a primary school teacher from Leicester who has been on 13 cruises, cannot wait to go again.\n\u201cCruising is a fantastic way to see the world for a reasonable price. The ships are clean and they always ask you to sanitise around the ship,\u201d Bowe said, when asked why she was still so keen to go.\n\u201cI started cruising with my disabled mum who has multiple sclerosis. She is in a wheelchair, so, for her, cruising is the way she can see the world. She can\u2019t really fly, so cruises from Southampton were our family holiday each year.\n\u201cNow my fiance and I cruise regularly. You meet lovely people of all ages from all over the world. It\u2019s a great social experience. We have made friends with fellow passengers that we still meet up with today. There is so much to do on board the ships and it would be a real shame if the industry came to end. Millions of people would lose their jobs around the world and for some people, working on the ships is a much better life.\u201d\nWhile Timson and Bowe are keen to get back on the water, some cruise fans have vowed to give the all-you-can-eat buffets a wide berth for good.\nMike Checkley-James, 61, a retired pension manager from Gloucestershire, said he has eight cruises booked between now and September 2021 but he hopes they are all cancelled. \u201cAfter 36 cruises over 23 years my cruising days are over,\u201d he said. \u201cThe magic for me has sadly died with this pandemic.\u201d\nAll cruise companies are struggling financially. Royal Caribbean has secured a $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) loan against its ships. Norwegian Cruise Line has drawn down a $1.55bn credit line. Shares in the London-listed Carnival Corporation, the world\u2019s largest cruise ship operator and the owner of the Diamond Princess, collapsed by 80% between February and the peak of stock market panic in mid-March.\nHowever, Carnival shares have gained 60% this week after the company secured $6.25bn of rescue financing, mostly secured against $28bn worth of its ships, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund revealed it had built an 8.2% stake in the company.\n\u201cPeople got really buoyed up by the Saudis buying in,\u201d Ross Klein, a professor at the maritime studies research unit at Memorial University of Newfoundland, said. \u201cPeople say he got a great deal and he\u2019s going to make a fortune. That may be the case but I don\u2019t see cruising bouncing back quickly.\u201d\nKlein said cruise companies will have to work hard to win back consumers\u2019 trust. \u201cThere will be some great deals for consumers to convince them to come on cruises,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is going to be a hard task convincing people that cruise ships are safe. It will be a very long time until cruise ships are trusted by the Australian government and consumers.\u201d\nAustralian authorities this week launched a criminal investigation into how passengers on the Ruby Princess were allowed to disembark in Sydney despite some exhibiting flu-like symptoms. More than 600 people on the ship later tested positive for coronavirus and 11 have since died \u2013 more than a fifth of Australia\u2019s deaths so far. The New South Wales police commissioner accused Carnival of potentially breaching biosecurity laws and allowing the virus to arrive in Australia.\nA Carnival spokesperson said: \u201cIn addition to willingly participating in the investigation, Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them.\u201d\nThe industry has managed to bounce back from a series of other disasters, including the capsizing of the Costa Concordia off the coast of Tuscany in 2012, which resulted in 33 deaths, and numerous outbreaks of norovirus, rotavirus and legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nBut Klein described the coronavirus pandemic as an \u201coff-the-scale challenge\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cBy offering huge discounts they will be able to convince people who have already been on multiple cruises to return. But the industry is set up for growth, with more and more bigger ships coming through, and to fill them they will need new customers. It will be extremely difficult to convince people who have never been on a cruise before to take one now, no matter how much money off you offer them.\u201d\nRobert Cole, a senior analyst for the leisure travel at the research firm Phocuswright, said the biggest challenge for the industry will be being able to maintain physical distancing onboard.\n\u201cCruise ships by definition are a mass of people cramped together in a small space and there\u2019s not much you can do structurally to change that,\u201d Cole said. \u201cEven when the immediate crisis is over, it is likely to be 18 months until a coronavirus vaccine is developed and until then travel will be highly restricted and some form of social-distancing measures will stay in place.\n\u201cOn cruise ships there are crushes of people everywhere. There are lineups [queues] for buffet, for shows and to get on and off at every port.\u201d\nThe demographics are not helpful either. A third of cruise passengers are 60 or older, the age group most at risk of serious illness and death from the virus.\n\u201cNo company wants its customers to be looking at it and saying: \u2018Hmm, that looks a bit risky\u2019,\u201d Cole said. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019re a zip-lining company, but not cruises.\u201d",

On 30 March, Mullen was handed a 750,000-share LTIP worth more than \u00a3650,000 at present. Like ITV, Reach said it could adjust payouts retrospectively if they balloon.\nG4S granted LTIPs worth a notional \u00a39m this week to 10 senior staff. The security firm has stressed that it could retrospectively adjust LTIP payouts and said directors were taking no 2020 bonus.\nInvestment institutions managing pension fund money will be watching closely to make sure firms rein in any LTIPs artificially inflated by stock market recovery.\n\u201cIn the overall context of the company, the experience of the workforce, the experience of shareholders, companies should think about making a gesture,\u201d said Hans-Christoph Hirt of Federated Hermes, which advises investors holding $877bn (\u00a3700bn) of assets.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a relatively quick recovery there may be windfall profits that are not really related to company performance but to the fact that there was a crisis and the government supported the overall economy.\u201d\nHe also warned against the temptation to redraw LTIP criteria in favour of bosses who might otherwise face diminished rewards.\n\u201cIt is critical not to allow readjustment of performance targets at this point,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you start to fiddle around with them and say things have changed and targets need to be lowered, pay wouldn\u2019t go down for 2020.\u201d\nShareholder advisory group Pirc would also be happy to see the back of LTIPs.\n\u201cIt happened during the banking crisis,\u201d said Tim Bush, Pirc\u2019s head of governance. \u201cThe fall in share price created volatility that helped executives meet the rise in share price criteria.\n\u201cThis crisis has shown that they are not aligned with the interests of shareholders.\u201d\nAmid renewed scrutiny on pay, executive sacrifices are proving varied.\nMonzo founder-boss Tom Blomfield will forego a year\u2019s pay worth \u00a31m, while Sky\u2019s Jeremy Darroch has pledged half his more than \u00a31m salary to pandemic relief. BT\u2019s chief Philip Jansen, who has himself had coronavirus, matched Darroch\u2019s donation.\nBank bosses, accustomed by now to outrage over corporate greed, have weighed in to differing degrees, under pressure from the Bank of England to show restraint.\nAlison Rose, boss of state-backed RBS, offered up 25% of salary and all of her bonus. Lloyds executives will lose only their bonuses.\nThere is new parsimony at Persimmon, the housebuilder castigated for the \u00a376m bonus handed to former boss Jeff Fairburn.\nIts board is taking a 20% pay cut and foregoing bonuses while workers are furloughed.\nMeanwhile BAE Systems has said it will review its pay plans at the half year.\nMonzo Tom Blomfield, 100% salary cut for 12 months\nSky Jeremy Darroch, six months\u2019 salary donated\nBT Philip Jansen, six months\u2019 salary donated\nRBS Alison Rose, 25% salary cut, no bonus\nRyanair Michael O\u2019Leary, 50% salary cut in April/May\nITV Carolyn McCall, 20% cut, no 2020 bonus\nVirgin Atlantic Shai Weiss, 20% cut from April to July\neasyJet Johan Lundgren, 20% cut for initial three months\nLloyds Antonio Horta-Osorio, no bonus for 2020\nBAE Systems Charles Woodburn, pledged to review",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist with the main stories on Saturday 11 April.\nMore than 1,200 Australians are expected to land at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine airport this weekend, with flights from Peru, India and Uruguay.\nThe flight from Uruguay is bringing home passengers of the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer.\nVictoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said the Victorian and commonwealth governments had \u201creports that up to 70% of these patients have tested positive to Covid-19\u201d.\nAustralia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, said the \u201centire operation has been meticulously planned\u201d.\nThe returning passengers will be medically screened, tested for Covid-19 if necessary, and transported by Victorian authorities to hotels to undergo 14 days of mandatory isolation.\nNew Zealanders on the flight will board a second charter flight home.\nAn emergency medical officer team will be on standby to assess all passengers as the international flights come in, and paramedics will also be on hand to take passengers to hospital if necessary.\nThe death toll in Australia has reached 56, with two more deaths \u2013 a 91-year-old woman in New South Wales, and a man in his 80s in Victoria \u2013 reported on Saturday.\nHowever, the daily case numbers have stabilised or fallen in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, the states with the largest number of cases from community transmission.\nMeanwhile the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, said authorities would \u201cring-fence\u201d health facilities in Burnie after an outbreak among health workers at the North West regional hospital spread to the North West private hospital.\nHealthcare workers, their households and any patient who was discharged from either facility from 27 March onwards has been asked to self-quarantine at their homes.\n\u201cRing-fencing is what we need to do, and ring-fencing is what we are going to do,\u201d Gutwein said.\nThe popular Bondi to Bronte coastal walk in Sydney has been closed by the local council, with fines for those who ignore newly erected barriers at entry points, because large crowds were continuing to visit the area despite orders to stay home.\nBondi is a hotspot for Covid-19 and people have been advised to exercise elsewhere.\n\u201cUnfortunately, closing the coastal walk was the only way the council could help ensure that public health orders could be maintained along the walk,\u201d the Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, said.\n\u201cI appreciate that this temporary closure will be met with frustration from some residents. I also appreciate how important it is for people to be able to exercise for mental health. I encourage people to be a tourist in their own suburb and find places to exercise on other streets and parks.\u201d\nCoatsworth said Australia needed to take a \u201cnuanced\u201d approach to reducing the restrictions imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus.\nHis comments came as experts warned against a quick reversal of restrictions.\n\u201cI think another way to put it might be that it was very fast into the restrictions and they were very widespread, and it needs to be very nuanced on the way out,\u201d Coatsworth said.\n\u201cSo you need to be very clear about if you\u2019re lifting a restriction, that you have done everything you can to try and understand exactly what the implications of that lifting would be before you actually implemented it.\u201d\nThe NRL has written permission to resume its season and has been specifically exempted from public health orders, meaning it could, if it chose, resume as planned on 28 May, the Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, said.\n\u201cIn reality we could do it tomorrow if we wanted to, but we\u2019re not going to because we\u2019re going to let the infection rate continue its stabilisation,\u201d V\u2019landys told Nine newspapers.\nThe NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, who reportedly got a call from V\u2019landys on Friday reminding him of the league\u2019s apparent exemption from the public health orders, said the decision to resume the season would not be made by politicians.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018have a discussion with health authorities to see if it can be done safely\u2019 [scenario],\u201d he said.\nThe Australian Health Protection Principal Committee\u2019s position was to \u201chave an approach which covers all codes\u201d, Coatsworth said. \u201cAnd I think at this point in time it is that we don\u2019t have training and we don\u2019t have matches and we keep social distancing, which is the object of not having sporting events.\u201d\nThe Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union has raised concerns about employee safety on a BHP mine site in central Queensland, after the mining company announced late on Friday that a worker at its Blackwater mine had tested positive to the virus.\nThat employee had not been on site since 1 April, BHP said.\nCFMEU Mining and Energy Queensland\u2019s president, Stephen Smyth, said the union had received minimal information about the positive test and was concerned about \u201cmultiple points of potential cross-contamination including machinery, transport, mess facilities and camp accommodation\u201d.\nBHP said its medical team took the temperatures of all onsite workers overnight \u201cand no abnormal temperatures were returned\u201d.",

        "content": "The resignation of six directors is the latest instalment in a soap opera in which boardroom squabbles have become the norm\nThe resignation letter six Barcelona directors handed to a notary on Thursday night, deepening the club\u2019s crisis, included a demand that the external investigation into what has become known as \u201cBar\u00e7agate\u201d be completed, with anyone responsible punished and any money repaid. The allegations, first reported by Cadena SER Radio, are that payments totalling \u20ac900,000 were made to the company I3 Ventures to run social-media accounts and websites that attacked opposition figures, players past and present, and defended the reputation of the president Josep Maria Bartomeu.\nBarcelona, Bartomeu and I3 Ventures have strongly denied wrongdoing, with the president describing the allegations as \u201ccompletely false\u201d, but either way the episode has made things worse. If it did happen, it didn\u2019t work. Sometimes there are too many fires to be put out and no chance of the men in the middle not getting burnt. However zealously a president is protected \u2013 and parts of the media are ready to champion Bartomeu \u2013 when so many bad things happen so fast, they are not going to emerge unscathed. And, boy, has a lot happened at Barcelona. Even not playing couldn\u2019t stop that, which may even make sense: for so long, the team have propped up the club; without it, maybe things were bound to fall down.\nIn an interview in mid-February, Lionel Messi had said: \u201cSince January there has been problem after problem\u201d. He wasn\u2019t wrong and it hasn\u2019t slowed. Nor, in fact, has he. Instead, it has accelerated, the catalogue so endless and so absurd as to be almost comic. The resignation of six board members, including two vice-presidents and the man earmarked as Bartomeu\u2019s successor, isn\u2019t even the latest incident.\nWithin hours of resigning, Emili Rousaud told RAC1 he thought someone at Barcelona had their \u201chand in the till\u201d. That prompted a statement from Barcelona \u201creserving the right to take legal action\u201d \u2013 another court case for a club with a collection of them \u2013 and insisting that, anyway, the resignations had been all part of Bartomeu\u2019s plans to \u201crestructure\u201d the board. And, so, on it goes.\nAny list risks leaving things out, and it is long enough anyway, even when limited to what has happened since January. Barcelona sacked their manager Ernesto Valverde, despite being top of the table. They offered the job to Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, who said no, later implying that he would not return under this board and insisting that \u201ctoxic\u201d influences had to be kept away from the dressing room. They offered the job to Ronald Koeman, who said no. As they should have known he would, committed as he is to the Netherlands. And they spoke to Mauricio Pochettino. Who said no too. They gave the job to Quique Seti\u00e9n, who admitted his surprise. This appointment was part of a long process, they said; \u201cI got the call yesterday,\u201d Seti\u00e9n replied, another lie laid bare.\nNext, the sporting director Eric Abidal suggested the players had played their part in Valverde\u2019s sacking. Messi, whose patience had long worn thin, who had once claimed that the then vice-president Javier Faus \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything about football\u201d, publicly called Abidal out, accusing him of \u201csullying\u201d the players names and demanding Abidal take responsibility for his own actions.\nMessi had leapt in because, as he later admitted, he was sick of the accusations that he runs the club. \u201cI don\u2019t know why people think that,\u201d he said. Perhaps because they wish he did.\nThere was more. Barcelona needed a striker. They didn\u2019t buy one, but they did sell two. They lost Luis Su\u00e1rez and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to long-term injuries and made the emergency signing of Martin Braithwaite \u2013 for more than they had been prepared to spend when the window was actually open, leaving C\u00e9dric Bakambu stranded at an airport thousands of miles away and leaving the squad so thin that they didn\u2019t have enough first-team players to fill the bench. Defeat in the cl\u00e1sico followed, for the first time in four years. And, with every new day, new transfer targets but no new money to buy them with.\nIn the midst of it all came the I3 Ventures allegations and the suspension of Jaume Masferrer, the president\u2019s closest adviser \u2013 a scapegoat who many believe is still there behind the scenes. Then came negotiations over a pay cut \u2013 at the club that, a month before, had announced itself as the biggest sporting brand in the world \u2013 and yet another public display of discontent and division. The players were furious, a statement released by Messi expressing \u201csurprise\u201d that from \u201cwithin the club\u201d they had been thrown to the lions, strategic leaks in their preferred papers designed to pressure them and make them look bad. \u201cWe were angry because things were said that were not true,\u201d Su\u00e1rez noted this week.\nThe players also put up an extra 2%, paying those employees the club could not or would not. Good news that made the club look bad and its president look worse. His public insistence that the leaks had not come from him or the CEO Oscar Grau, pushing blame elsewhere, deepened distrust on the board, where some members were demanding answers about that and about I3: they wanted to know too why so much had been paid, and why it had been paid in instalments conveniently small enough to avoid triggering internal audits \u2013 all of which came to a head with Rousaud\u2019s accusations.\nThe debt is asphyxiating, the squad debilitated. Weaker by the year, but no cheaper: players\u2019 salaries account for an unhealthy 67% of the budget. There is mistrust everywhere: between players and board; between board member and board member, too. Bartomeu, whose mandate runs until 2021 when he cannot stand again, was encouraged to bring forward elections. Some thought his model too presidentialist, and consider him too indulgent of footballers who have even less faith in him than they do. He saw disloyalty, even among those board members who were supposed to be more firmly on his side, building to a Catalan night of the long knives.\nIt is only a month since Bartomeu named Rousaud as a vice-president, the man put into place to succeed him. Instead, Bartomeu moved against him. On Tuesday he called four directors \u2013 Rousaud, Enrique Tombas, Silvio Elias, Josep Pont \u2013 and in effect invited them to walk, knowing that he could not sack them. \u201cHe told me he had concerns about a series of directors, including me: it\u2019s illogical,\u201d Rousaud said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way he handled it.\u201d\nTwo days later, Rousaud, Tombas, Elias and Pont did indeed walk. That could be seen as a victory, but Bartomeu had not anticipated their being joined by Jordi Calsamiglia and Maria Teixidor. Besides, collective resignation is rarely a victory for any president, still less when it is as public as the players\u2019 increasing criticism, when it draws divisions even further into the open, when the crises accumulate.\nOf the board Bartomeu put together in 2015, less than half are left. There are 13 people there now, when the club\u2019s statutes say there must be at least 14. And, Rousaud claimed, \u201cthere are least three more directors considering [resigning]\u201d. Bartomeu has had four sporting directors and as many directors of communication. It is inevitable that people ask whether it really is always their fault; whether at the very least he might have chosen better; and what he will do next time someone steps out of line, where the departures will stop. He has seen seven vice-presidents depart. There are three left, two posts vacant. At least one of them is a man he\u2019s never going to sack, even as many think he should, if only because one of them is he.",

        "content": "The truth about how you can catch coronavirus, who is most vulnerable and what you can do to avoid infection\nWearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick \u2013 viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).\nIf you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill \u2013 ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.\nHowever, masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.\nAll viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection \u2013 the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most \u201csuccessful\u201d. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.\nGenetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.\nThe team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more \u201caggressive\u201d, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage \u2013 there haven\u2019t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.\nMany individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country\u2019s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.\nMost people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups \u2013 health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.\nFor flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.\nScientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking \u2013 and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.\u2019\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

Figures from Johns Hopkins University show 2,108 people died in the past 24 hours, with more than half a million confirmed infections.\nAmerica could soon surpass Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths worldwide. The news came as White House experts said the spread of the virus was starting to level off. Dr Deborah Birx said there were good signs the outbreak was stabilising but cautioned: \u201cAs encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.\u201d\nBritain has not yet reached the Covid-19 peak, which would allow for an easing of lockdown restrictions, said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. The death toll in British hospitals has reached almost 9,000, with 980 more deaths reported on Friday. The figure exceeded the deadliest day so far in Italy, the country worst hit by the virus. Hancock said the Easter weekend would be a \u201ctest of the nation\u2019s resolve\u201d. He issued another warning to the public to stay at home amid the coronavirus crisis.\nSpain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll fell for the third consecutive day on Saturday after 510 fatalities were reported in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said in a statement. It marked the smallest overnight increase since 23 March. Total fatalities from the virus rose to 16,353, from 15,843 on Friday, the ministry said, while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 161,852 from 157,022.\nSouth Korea has announced plans to strap tracking wristbands on people who ignore quarantine orders. Officials said stricter controls were required to enforce self-isolation rules.\n Some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home have apparently slipped out by leaving behind their smartphones, which are used to monitor movement.\nThe Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has decided to extend a nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, the Delhi chief minister said on Saturday. He did not say how long the extension would be. Earlier in the day, Modi held a video conference call with several state ministers. The Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said Modi had \u201ctaken a correct decision to extend the lockdown\u201d, without sharing further details.\nIran\u2019s total death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 4,357 on Saturday, with 125 people having lost their lives in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said. The total number of people diagnosed with the disease rose by 1,837 in the past 24 hours to a total of 70,029, ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpur said, with 3,987 of those infected in critical condition.

It says it now recognises that its prediction last week of 66,000 deaths caused alarm. Models are only as good as the data that goes into them. Having included more recent figures, as the institute said it would, the picture has changed.\n\u201cIHME expects, going forward, that as the model has more data, the range of possible forecasts likely will narrow,\u201d said a spokesman.\nThe 66,000 figure was disputed by scientists whose modelling of the likely shape of the UK epidemic is relied on by the government. Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said last week when the prediction was published that the IHME figures were twice as high as they should have been.\nIn a note on its website, the IHME explained how it came to the earlier high figures. \u201cOur initial release of EEA country predictions included reported daily deaths through 5 April. For the United Kingdom, daily death data during the week prior to 5 April showed sharp and steadily increasing cumulative daily deaths,\u201d it said.\n\u201cSince our last release, we have been able to include four more days of reported daily deaths for the UK (6, 7, 8, 9 April).\u201d A slower rate of increase in deaths, which will have been due to the physical distancing measures taking effect, and better data on what happened in other places in the world where epidemics had peaked, \u201chas resulted in notably lower average projections for the UK,\u201d it said.\nIt had also received updated information on bed capacity and ICU capacity, it said, and had reduced its forecasts on shortages of those.\nItaly is forecast to have the second highest death toll, at 20,000. Spain and the Netherlands are predicted to have 18,000 each and France around 16,000.\n\u201cOf countries with the highest reported or projected peak of daily Covid-19 deaths, three \u2013 Italy, Spain, and France \u2013 appear to have potentially experienced their peaks. Other European countries with relatively high daily Covid-19 deaths that may have already peaked include Belgium (peak on 7 April, 403 deaths) and Germany (8 April, 254 deaths).\n\u201cSwitzerland, which is not part of the EEA, currently has a predicted peak of 124 deaths (estimate range of 9 to 454) on about 4 May. As increasingly more data becomes available \u2013 and/or as countries adjust social distancing policies \u2013 these predictions may change,\u201d said the IHME.",

It believes the money can help improve the educational prospects of children in places where public-sector schools are poor or lacking.\nBut the funding, some of it channelled through DfID\u2019s private investment arm, CDC, has proved controversial. Among those that have received UK taxpayer cash are the private school chain Bridge International Academies (BIA) which has also been the recipient of money from Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe chain has been applauded for raising education levels in several of the countries in which it operates. But respected organisations, including the United Nations, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the UK parliament\u2019s International Development Committee have raised concerns about the quality of BIA\u2019s educational programme, its relationship with governments, its compliance with government regulations, and relatively high cost of fees.\nCampaigners claim that the IFC\u2019s decision \u2013 which will be subject to an evaluation and could be overturned \u2013 calls into question the continued use of UK money to support private education in the global south. \u201cDfID and CDC must now reflect on their continuing support for for-profit education despite significant evidence these projects exclude marginalised communities and have questionable impact,\u201d said Daniel Willis, a policy and campaigns manager at Global Justice Now.\nA spokeswoman for BIA said: \u201cA decision to freeze investment at this critical time for education in the developing world is an unfortunate one when global leaders are campaigning to increase resources and investment.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for CDC said: \u201cWe are aware of the IFC\u2019s recent announcement and are reviewing the matter.\u201d\nA DFID spokesperson said: \u201cDFID sets CDC\u2019s Investment Policy but is not involved in CDC\u2019s investment decisions. The CDC are reviewing the IFC\u2019s announcement and we are in contact with them on this.\u201d",

        "content": "Move is likely to be part of attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemic\nChina is cracking down on publication of academic research about the origins of the novel coronavirus, in what is likely to be part of a wider attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemic, documents published online by Chinese universities appear to show.\nTwo websites for leading Chinese universities appear to have recently published and then removed pages that reference a new policy requiring academic papers dealing with Covid-19 to undergo extra vetting before they are submitted for publication.\nResearch on the origins of the virus is particularly sensitive and subject to checks by government officials, the notices posted on the websites of Fudan University and the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) said. Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.\nProf Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.\n\u201cIn terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the economy and public health aren\u2019t important. But the narrative is paramount.\u201d\nWith the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and the first weeks of the pandemic \u2013 when there was a cover-up by local officials \u2013 may be considered particularly sensitive.\n\u201cIf these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,\u201d said Tsang of the reports of new regulations.\nChina University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have published and then deleted new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China\u2019s ministry of science and technology before publication.\nThe university\u2019s academic committee was expected to first go through the research \u201cwith an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,\u201d the regulation said.\n\u201cWhen the checks have been completed, the school should report to the Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST], and it should only be published after it has [also] been checked by MOST,\u201d it said.\nDespite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research.\nA separate document obtained by the Guardian, which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry.\nAnother notice, which appears to have been published on 9 April by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for \u201cstrict and serious\u201d management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak.\nPapers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of China\u2019s ministry of education.\nA source who alerted the Guardian to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process.\nThe person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication.\nA technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed. The Guardian could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy.\nThe notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said on 3 April that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted.\nIn March China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included \u201ctracing the origin of the virus\u201d on a list of national priorities. It was referenced by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders.\nThe Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the Guardian to the Chinese embassy in Washington.\nWhile the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the Huanan seafood \u201cwet market\u201d in Wuhan.\nScientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.\nScientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.\nKevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.\n\u201cThey are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,\u201d Carrico said.\nCarrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.\n\u201cThere is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face \u2026 that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,\u201d he said.\nAround a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus could have come from outside the country. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan.",

        "content": "Talks to join forces and end the deadlock have broken down at the last minute, with each side blaming the other\nA proposed unity government deal involving Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and opposition leader, Benny Gantz, appears to be in jeopardy as initial progress stalls and a deadline this week looks set to be missed.\nThe pair \u2013 who have battled for more than a year in three inconclusive elections \u2013 had both expressed a desire to come to an understanding as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. Talks to join forces and end the crippling political deadlock appeared to be in the final stages. One power-sharing deal would see them rotate the role of leader over a four-year term.\nHowever, last week Gantz\u2019s party, Blue and White, said that, after an \u201call-round agreement\u201d had been reached, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party suddenly resurrected old demands about judicial appointments. Likud countered that it was Gantz who backed away at the last minute.\nGantz\u2019s deadline to form a coalition government will expire on Monday, though Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, may allow him two extra weeks. The president could equally hand the mandate to Netanyahu, although, like Gantz, he does not have the seats to form a majority.\nLocal media speculated that Netanyahu might have \u201ctorpedoed\u201d the negotiations after polls showed his party could win a possible fourth election, which will be held if the stalemate continues.\nGantz took a significant risk last month when he went against senior members of his own party to abort attempts to push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s career in favour of restarting talks for a deal.\nBlue and White had threatened to introduce term-limits for prime ministers, and a ban on them serving while under indictment. Both scenarios would have ended Netanyahu\u2019s political career. He is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader and is fighting three major corruption cases, including on charges of bribery and fraud. Netanyahu denies all the allegations.\nHowever, in a move that came as a surprise even to his allies, Gantz nominated himself and was elected speaker of parliament, apparently to shield Netanyahu from such bills.\nThe plot twist cost Gantz more than half his Knesset members, who broke away, but the former head of the army argued that it was necessary to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.\n\u201cThese are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That\u2019s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,\u201d Gantz told the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.\nIsraeli commentators, however, have suggested that Gantz, who entered politics less than two years ago, may have been too optimistic about Netanyahu, famed as a political magician, agreeing to share the top seat.\n\u201cGantz is not at all built to deal with such phenomena,\u201d Yossi Verter wrote in Haaretz newspaper. \u201cIn his naivety, he decided in one quick moment to jump into bed with Netanyahu without guarantees \u2013 and in doing so he tore apart his party. He tried to play \u2018fair\u2019 against a competitor for whom such a principle arouses nothing but deep contempt.\u201d",

        "content": "Driver had a new lease of life with her return to racing in last year\u2019s W Series, but the coronavirus crisis has wrenched away the opportunity to build on that success\nTwelve months ago Alice Powell described her return to motor racing as a new lease of life. After four years without a drive she grasped her chance in the all-female W Series with unbridled verve. However, with her career resurgent the opportunity to build on her success has been wrenched away by the coronavirus-induced sporting shutdown. It has struck Powell as a body blow. \u201cThe thought of having another year not racing is pretty gutting,\u201d she says bluntly.\nPowell fears there may be no racing this year but is emphatic that if that is necessary to defeat the virus, then every sport must take it on the chin. \u201cMy other half thinks that we might not go racing at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI say: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly,\u2019 but in the back of my mind I think he could be right. That is really upsetting because last year was my time back racing after being out for a long time.\u201d\nAfter lack of funding forced her out of racing to the extent that she believed her career was all but over, last year Powell finished the inaugural W Series on a high. The 27-year-old from Oxford won the final round at Brands Hatch and was third in the championship. Her performances caught the attention, new seats opened up and another season in the W Series beckoned. But the promise of 2020 lies in tatters and the outbreak may yet finish it off.\nIt has clearly been a major disappointment and she admits to finding the situation depressing, but there is no pause as Powell immediately acknowledges the bigger picture. \u201cIf it means we can fight the virus, stop it from spreading, prevent illness and deaths then of course we should not go racing,\u201d she says.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s health is much more important. Clearly, there are far more important things in the world than us getting back in a car.\n\u201cWhen races started to get cancelled it really hit home. But it is absolutely the right decision. You can put so many lives at risk and we need to stop this spreading. The number of people at a racetrack, hundreds and thousands of people, you can\u2019t keep social distance at a racetrack. So it is the right thing to do.\u201d\nThe W Series is no exception to the sporting lockdown. The DTM \u2013 the German touring car championship \u2013 to which it is a support series has postponed its opening three meetings and discussions are continuing on if and when they may begin racing. Two W Series rounds were due to take place at Formula One meetings this year, in the US and Mexico, a real step forward that is now in jeopardy.\nLast year\u2019s inaugural season offered female drivers the chance to compete in F3 cars for a championship where the series covered all the costs, the intent being to promote their talent and help their careers move forward. For Powell it worked handsomely: she became one of several competitors whose subsequent success comprehensively proved the series is making a difference.\nBefore the end of the season Powell was offered a drive in the US in the IMSA sports car championship. That was followed by a contract for a full-time seat in the Jaguar I-pace eTrophy series that supports Formula E meetings. Before its calendar also came to halt Powell had made her mark, with two podium finishes helping her to third in the standings, while in February she was given a shot in the Formula E rookie test for Envision Virgin Racing.\n\u201cMy name wasn\u2019t out there, when I wasn\u2019t racing,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople started to forget about me, I hadn\u2019t been around, then the W Series came along and the attraction of interest from around the world was incredible. That surely had to help. Without the W Series I probably wouldn\u2019t have had the drives.\u201d\nPowell has been racing since she was eight. Her talent was recognised early yet despite success across a range of championships including GP3, she did not receive backing and as the money dried up so did the opportunities for her to compete.\nShe continued as a racing coach but was working with her father in house renovations when the W Series offered her a second chance. It was a life-changing moment, brought home recently in a moment of quiet reflection during the lockdown. \u201cI was looking back through photos on my phone,\u201d she says. \u201cI have lots of photos of my dog and that kind of stuff and then it hit January last year and it\u2019s just all racing.\u201d\nPowell is as engaging and enthusiastic as she is sharp and competitive on the track. That racing is everything to her is unmistakable: it is a passion to which she is wholly committed. She feels its absence almost as a physical loss, yet accepts with an admirably calm stoicism that under the current circumstances even another year out would be a small price to pay.\n\u201cWe love our sport so much,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I don\u2019t know when I will next be in a car again brings me back to when I was not racing and that sinking feeling inside that I don\u2019t know when it is next going to be, its horrible.\n\u201cBut the health of everybody is far more important. More important than racing. More important than sport.\u201d",

They also tend to take on the bulk of unpaid family care at home, a burden that has become even more all-consuming amid physical distancing and self-isolation.\nAnd, even as women represent 70% of the global health workforce, the critical resources they need to stay well \u2013 reproductive health services, maternal care \u2013 may fall by the wayside as the world\u2019s hospitals go into crisis mode. That, in turn, could lead to more maternal mortalities, young pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, according to a UN policy brief published on Thursday.\nBecause of the pandemic, the report said, \u201ceven the limited gains made in the past decades\u201d toward gender equality \u201care at risk of being rolled back\u201d.\nIn the US, the country with by far the most confirmed coronavirus cases, Covid-19 has already laid siege to people\u2019s health and livelihoods. At least 16 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past three weeks. Layoffs and furloughs will probably continue as businesses remain shuttered and workers stay home.\nWomen are suffering heavy losses, data from the Fuller Project suggest. The majority of unemployment applicants in states such as New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Minnesota in mid- to late March were women, an alarming surge compared with past years.\nThis flood of applications coincided with school closures and stay-at-home orders, as children required near-constant attention and restaurants and other services shut down.\n\u201cIf we take, for instance, the great recession, that is an economic crisis driven by economic factors, whereas this is an economic crisis which is driven by health factors,\u201d said Xanthe Scharff, co-founder and CEO of the Fuller Project. \u201cAnd that really changes the nature of the economic fallout, because at the heart of this is a need for social distancing.\u201d\nThe very notion of isolation has disrupted the hospitality, retail and tourism industries that many women rely on for their livelihoods, according to the UN. And even after the economy reopens, those workers may still find themselves in dire straits: the UN projects \u201ca prolonged dip in women\u2019s incomes and labor force participation\u201d because of Covid-19.\nWith a depleted job market, men who were in other, more lucrative industries may compete for roles traditionally filled by women, said Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women. Women, however, will have to wait to search for work until their kids are settled at school and any sick family members get well.\n\u201cI foresee that there\u2019ll be a scarcity of job openings available for women to take because they\u2019re gonna lag behind in being able to access those jobs,\u201d Van Pelt said.\nWomen are also facing existential threats to their safety and freedoms right now as domestic violence victims are constantly confined with their abusers and the pandemic threatens access to reproductive health care, the UN warned.\nViolence against women has increased by more than 25% in many places around the world, according to the UN, and helplines in the US are already getting coronavirus-related calls from domestic abuse victims. Meanwhile, states already cool on abortion rights are trying to temporarily bar such operations for the time being.\n\u201cThey\u2019re using this virus to end women\u2019s constitutional rights across the country,\u201d said Van Pelt.\nIf there were more female leaders, the world might have been able to anticipate some of the crises it is facing now, such as an increase in violence against women, Valji suggested.\n\u201cThe fact that we do not have women in leadership roles decision-making on the response to this pandemic means that we are missing huge pieces of information, of experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that affects everybody.\u201d\nA statement from the US mission to the UN read, in part: \u201cThe United States recognizes the disproportionate impact that conflict and crises often have on women and girls. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen women around the world serving on the frontlines as medical professionals, emergency workers, caregivers and other essential personnel who are courageously stepping up and responding to the needs of those affected by the pandemic.\u201d\nIt also acknowledged that measures such as stay-at-home orders \u201cmay further endanger\u201d women and girls.",

As a fluffy red mohawk and fishnet tights indicate, pop music does not impress her much. Yet even viewers who share her cynicism may find themselves weak to the psychotropic pleasures offered by this trippy sequel to the 2016 animated musical extravaganza.\nIn this latest outing, the original pop-loving Trolls discover that five other tribes exist: Techno, Funk, Classical, Country and Hard Rock, and the latter, led by Queen Barb, intends to \u201cunite one nation of Trolls under rock\u201d. The freshly crowned Queen Poppy (Anna Kendrick) heads up the revolution against Barb\u2019s fascism, but the film is wry enough to know that even pop music isn\u2019t immune to critique. A track by LMFAO from 2011 is rightly decreed \u201ca crime against music\u201d and funk legend George Clinton croons about cultural appropriation. Mercifully, it\u2019s more weird than worthy.\nAnother clever aspect of the film is the way it visually translates different musical genres. Techno Trolls have neon glow-stick hair and pulsating, pixelated hearts; the walls of \u201cVibe City\u201d undulate like a 70s-style lava lamp. Fifty Shades of Grey\u2019s Jamie Dornan cameos as the icky \u201cSmooth Jazz Chaz\u201d, flowing hair and siren saxophone making for a cheering comedy riff on Kenny G. The only bum note is the music itself, despite the presence of prestige pop stars including Justin Timberlake, Kelly Clarkson and Mary J Blige.",

        "content": "Some green spaces have reopened after public pressure, but authorities warn rules must be adhered to\nPeople in parks across the UK were urged this weekend by police, rangers and volunteers to follow physical distancing guidance after some green spaces were reopened following public pressure.\nThe government has warned people to continue adhering to the lockdown measures, despite the sunny weather and the desire to see friends and family over the Easter bank holiday weekend.\nMany local authorities took the decision to close green spaces following the introduction of lockdown measures due to concerns over public safety, prompting criticism that those living in crowded conditions would have nowhere to go to exercise and enjoy green space.\nVictoria Park in east London reopened on Saturday after more than a fortnight closed, and the local mayor said he was frustrated it had taken so long to reopen it.\nLocal police and the council were said to have taken the decision jointly after some visitors were \u201cprovocative and hostile\u201d to officers and rangers enforcing physical distancing rules, but John Biggs, Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets, suggested the Metropolitan police held up the process of reopening the park.\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated it\u2019s been shut for a while,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe made a joint decision and we needed to reassure each other that everything was in the right place.\u201d\nBiggs said there had been a number of incidents where people were not taking physical distancing seriously and that he hoped these events did not repeat themselves. Ultimately, though, he said it was important that people get fresh air and exercise.\n\u201cHaving closed it, it\u2019s been pretty hard to get it reopened again and you can see from the volume of people here today quite how much people love their local park,\u201d he said.\nA spokesperson from the Met said: \u201cThe opening of public space such as parks is the decision of the local authority. The MPS will continue to patrol through the whole borough, including Victoria Park, with Covid-19, social distancing and public safety in mind.\u201d\nIn the park, people were seen walking and exercising alone, in pairs and in families, while police on horseback and foot encouraged people not to sit down. Cyclists were not allowed to ride their bicycles through the 86-hectare (213-acre) space, which forms part of the National Cycle Network.\n\u201cIts quite nice, there\u2019s no planes in the sky, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d said 29-year-old Jack Cunningham, who lives in nearby Hackney Wick. \u201cI think a short-term closure while they planned things was probably sensible but maybe they could have said it was temporary.\u201d\nSusie, who lives locally and did not wish to give her surname, said the decision to close the park was \u201cstupid\u201d.\n\u201cI missed the park. I need it for my mental health,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it was stupid to close the park because it forced people to the canal, where they are more clustered.\u201d\nA ranger said that there had been huge pressure to reopen the historic park, which first opened to the public in 1845 after a public petition, and became known as the \u201cpeople\u2019s park\u201d.\n\u201cThe wildfowl and waterfowl had a lovely two-week holiday without any dogs chasing them, but the park is for the people,\u201d he said, asking not to be named.\n\u201cThere was an awful lot of pressure to reopen it, even people with back gardens need to get out. Mental health is a big issue and we do need exposure to other people, at a social distance, along with the natural environment.\u201d\nIn the Greater Manchester and Cheshire suburbs, the public were adhering to lockdown rules with no signs of group gatherings or people flouting the physical distancing guidance.\nIn the Cheshire village of Disley, the popular National Trust site of Lyme Park \u2013 which would normally be full of people on a sunny bank holiday weekend \u2013 remained closed. The large iron gates were locked, with signs in red informing the public of the closure.\nMeanwhile, in the suburban village of Compstall, just outside Stockport, Etherow Country Park, a local nature reserve, remained open. The car park was quiet, with a few dog walkers and families gathered around the lake. All were adhering to the physical distancing guidelines.\nThe situation was similar in Brabyns Park, in the nearby village of Marple Bridge. Play areas remained deserted and people were out walking alone or in pairs.\nIn Surrey and Sussex, as forces across the UK increased patrols, police used a talking drone to tell people suspected of breaching coronavirus restrictions to go home during the Easter weekend.\nThe \u201csky talk\u201d drone was deployed by Surrey police to target a group of 30 people who were not abiding by physical distancing measures in Walton-on-Thames on Good Friday.\nThe drone plays a recorded message, saying: \u201cAttention, this is a police message. You are gathering in breach of government guidelines to stay at home in response to the coronavirus. You are putting lives at risk. Please disperse immediately and return home.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council does not expect police to use drones to disperse groups, and that it would be up to force chiefs to justify their approach.",

        "content": "It may be months before official figures reveal the extent of decline \u2013 so analysts are using proxy data to measure it\nBritain\u2019s economy contracted in February, sending the first signals of a downturn that is expected to quickly turn into a slump. According to last week\u2019s official figures, the UK\u2019s national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), fell by 0.1%.\nEven though the Covid-19 virus had yet to take hold in the UK and the government lockdown was several weeks away, the economy was hit during the month by heavy rainfall, which closed building sites and discouraged consumers from venturing out.\nFor the past three years, the economy has stayed afloat thanks to buoyant consumer spending and, latterly, the recruitment of civil servants to help the government prepare for Brexit, offsetting the problems of a manufacturing industry that spent much of 2019 in recession. But GDP, which crept up during the first half of 2019, finished the year with a final quarter of zero growth.\nIt will be several months before official figures begin to capture the collapse in economic activity experienced since February, which has encouraged City investment banks and thinktanks to look at detailed data to build a picture of the downturn as it progresses.\nUniversal credit applications have rocketed since the lockdown. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show 500,000 people applied for universal credit, the government\u2019s main welfare benefit, in the last two weeks of March. This was followed by an additional 250,000 in the first week of April.\nThe DWP has refused to give updates since then, but the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the increase slowed last week.\nIt is not difficult to see why universal credit claims have spiralled. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that almost 30% of businesses are furloughing workers in the short term.\nBusinesses in the IT and information services sector are better off: so far only 10% of workers have been laid off. But more than half of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector have shed workers.\nThe Resolution Foundation thinktank believes the trend for further universal credit claims \u2013 often held in a queue by the slow pace of processing at DWP call centres \u2013 will continue for some time.\nOne measure to give an indication of the trend was the decline in the number of job vacancies, which only two years ago reached a record high. Another was the number of online searches for information on how to claim benefits, it said.\n\u201cThe frequency of web searches for unemployment-related terms has fallen further this week and [they] are now less than half of the levels seen in the middle of March,\u201d the foundation said. \u201cBut even though web searches have fallen, they are still around levels that were seen at the peak of the financial crisis in 2009.\u201d\nThe knock-on effect to the economy is likely to be dramatic, the thinktank believes. \u201cA 30% fall in employment \u2013 consistent with a number of published surveys \u2013 suggests GDP could end up contracting by as much as 5% in the first quarter, with much worse to follow in the second quarter. Such sharp contractions in activity would be unprecedented.\u201d\nBy the end of March, the FTSE 100 had recorded its biggest quarterly fall for more than three decades, such was the financial panic caused by the coronavirus. Investors feared the costs of coping with a global pandemic would continue to mount as more people died and governments kept their economies in lockdown.\nThe leading index of UK company shares plunged by 25% in the three months to the end of March, a slump in share values not seen since the aftermath of Black Monday in October 1987.\nThis month the index has staged a recovery, along with stock markets in all the major financial centres, in response to figures showing the worst-hit countries \u2013 Italy and Spain \u2013 are reaching the peak of new cases. On 23 March, the FTSE index slipped below 5,000 points to 4,993. Last Friday it had recovered almost 1000 points to 5,842.\nAs a proxy for the nation\u2019s wealth, the FTSE is not always reliable, given its large number of overseas-based companies, but with most British workers\u2019 pensions invested in shares, the recent turmoil has come as a shock to many. Analysts expect the volatility seen over the last month to continue as governments search for ways to ease restrictions on business.\nThe number of people taking bus and train journeys has collapsed to little more than 20% of its normal level for the time of year.\nA study by the investment bank Jefferies and the public transport app Moovit found that daily usage of mass transit across the UK, weighted by population, hit 22% on 1 April. This figure is likely to have declined further as the government discourages workers from using buses and trains in major cities, which initially continued to see large numbers of people travelling in rush-hour periods.\nTransport for London has reported that it will lose \u00a3500m in revenue from a clampdown that it hopes will drive passenger numbers on the tube network below 5% over the Easter weekend. Car use has also declined, though many key workers have preferred to drive to work over the last month, viewing it as a quicker and safer form of transport.\nBusinesses are huge consumers of energy. The shutdown of large parts of the manufacturing sector and the vast number of offices left empty has brought down electricity consumption to 85% of normal levels. The consumption of gas has held up, due to its use for domestic heating. The recent warm weather has resulted in a seasonal drop in demand, but this drop has been offset by the millions of people staying at home to work.\nAnalysts at Cornwall Insight said manufacturers were quick to scale down energy consumption in February as the spread of the virus in China hit imports and restricted domestic production. The clampdown on non-essential work meant most factories closed or switched to making products needed during the pandemic.\nThe almost total shutdown of restaurants, bars, pubs and leisure facilities has hugely affected energy consumption in that sector.\nNot surprisingly, wholesale energy prices have tumbled as demand has dropped. This situation was made worse by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over supplies that has led to international markets being flooded with oil, despite a tentative deal on Friday to limit production.",

        "content": "The outbreak has generated a tsunami of information. Here\u2019s how to sift the fact from the fiction\nSeldom have we had to get to grips so quickly with a slew of new terms and abbreviations. Had you told most people last Christmas that soon they would be WFH, they might have considered it a cryptic insult. Most probably had only a vague idea what an epidemiologist did or what a ventilator was, while PPE was (if anything) a soft Oxford degree favoured by politicians, rather than the personal protective equipment now urgently needed in hospitals. Few could have told you the difference between an epidemic (the outbreak and rapid spread of an infectious disease through a population) and a pandemic (an epidemic that occurs over a very wide geographical area, perhaps the whole world).\nEven the terminology of the virus itself is challenging: the coronaviruses are a family of pathogens, this particular one (being related to that which caused the Sars outbreak of 2002-3) denoted Sars-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the respiratory syndrome it causes, much as Aids is to HIV. A vaccine confers immunity (probably just for a limited period) to the virus; an antiviral interferes with viral replication in the body to slow or arrest its bad effects. Antibiotics attack bacterial pathogens, not viruses, but may be needed with Covid-19 to treat secondary infections such as pneumonia that take advantage of a compromised immune system. Expect to hear lots in the coming weeks about serological tests, which look for proteins in the blood that signal past infection, even if the virus has long since been cleared from the body. Those tests are under development, and they will provide vital information on how widespread infection has been \u2013 and whether many (or few) have had Covid-19 without any symptoms at all.\nWhile comparisons with wartime and the blitz spirit are deeply misleading, one analogy holds: the second world war slogan \u201cLoose talk can cost lives\u201d is apt here too.\nWhat makes the coronavirus so deadly is a combination of two numbers. The reproduction number (denoted R0) is the average number of people an infected individual goes on to infect in the absence of any social distancing or quarantining; the mortality rate is the percentage of infected people who die.\nBoth depend on the biology of the virus, but neither is fixed. R0 for the coronavirus is about 2.5 to three (compared with 1.3 for common flu), but that\u2019s an average \u2013 it varies from person to person. Reducing person-to-person contacts cuts the effective reproduction number R \u2013 and the epidemic will decay if it drops below one. The mortality rate, meanwhile, depends on the availability of healthcare for people with the most serious symptoms: it is about 0.4% in Germany, 4.6% in the UK, and more than 10% in Iran.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nThe bad news is that low testing rates means it is virtually impossible to track the progress of the virus, and can give a false sense of security. The good news is that if more people have the virus than we know, the mortality rate will be lower than the \u201cofficial\u201d value. There have been speculations that the extent of infection might be much greater than thought, and that most cases don\u2019t even show symptoms. But this idea is hard to reconcile with observations from countries with extensive testing, which seem to indicate that few people get the virus without knowing.\nWhen you see a WhatsApp message about \u201cA friend who is an A&E doctor at a leading hospital \u2026 \u201d, don\u2019t assume it is reliable, even if it came from your own friend. Don\u2019t, even with the best of intentions, tell your other friends about it.\nIf you want to check the credibility of social media posts, organisations such as FullFact and Snopes audit messages doing the rounds.\nRemember also the old quip that the plural of \u201canecdote\u201d is not data. We notice anomalies and give them undue emphasis. Some highly unusual cases, among so many infections, are to be expected but this doesn\u2019t mean they are true or examples of a common phenomenon.\nThe news website The Conversation has a handy guide to spotting fake news. Perhaps the most useful of its tips is: \u201cIf the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable.\u201d\nSorting fact from fiction has become harder in this crisis because even well informed experts aren\u2019t always united in their advice. Disagreements are normal in science, but are rarely a matter of life and death. It has been as frustrating and unsettling to science reporters as it has to everyone else to find experts at loggerheads over basic concepts such as \u201cherd immunity\u201d. It is, frankly, still a source of puzzlement why it took a single modelling study from Imperial College London to persuade expert government scientific advisers of what other experts (such as those at the World Health Organization) had been saying all along: that without stringent containment measures, the UK death rate would be catastrophic.\nSo now even the fine details of the science are being held up to us all for scrutiny. It\u2019s unprecedented for a national newspaper to publish a full, simplified version of a scientific paper, as the Observer did with the Imperial study. There will need to be more of this and with luck, it will spread understanding of how scientific results are carefully formulated and circumscribed with caveats, so that experts are seen as well-informed specialists doing their best with the tools and data at hand.\nWith the stakes this high, experts exploring speculative ideas take on a responsibility they aren\u2019t used to. A study from epidemiologists at Oxford recently caused a stir when it was reported as claiming that as much as half of the UK population might have already been infected with the coronavirus, mostly without any symptoms. The work was quite reasonably exploring a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. But the headline in the Financial Times made it sound like an empirical possibility. Researchers will need to be more explicit about what their findings do and do not mean.\nAll drugs have to pass stringent tests before they are approved for use. In general they are first tested on animals, and then enter \u201cclinical trials\u201d on humans, of which there are three stages. Phase one, conducted on small numbers of healthy volunteers, checks for safety, looking for toxicity or serious side-effects. Phase two then tests whether the drug actually works in humans with the condition targeted. Finally, phase three trials are conducted on large numbers of people \u2013 typically hundreds or thousands \u2013 to see how it will work in the clinic and make sure there are no other complications or failures before making the drug generally available.\nVaccines will have to go through all of these phases, and could, like most candidate drugs, fail at any one of them. While drug-regulation agencies are considering ways to streamline and fast-track the process because of the urgency of the situation, this can only go so far. A coronavirus vaccine would be given to millions of healthy people \u2013 ultimately, perhaps to most of the world\u2019s population \u2013 and so it\u2019s more essential than ever that its safety is checked thoroughly.\nWhat\u2019s more, even when a vaccine gets approved, manufacturing it at such a large scale will be a tremendous challenge \u2013 only a few pharmaceutical companies worldwide have that capacity. And distribution will present difficulties too, especially to more remote parts of developing countries, or among overcrowded, poorer neighbourhoods in large megacities. If, as is hoped, a vaccine is ready by the middle of 2021, that speed will be remarkable and unprecedented.\nIt is hoped that some antivirals already developed and tested for other conditions, such as Ebola (remdesivir) or Sars, could work for Covid-19, because they attack similar targets in the virus. In that case some of the testing has essentially already been done, so we would get a head start. There is also broader interest in \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d \u2013 investigating whether the many drugs that failed for their intended use, but which passed the safety trials, could prove effective for quite different conditions.\nIn tests on a new drug \u2013 how safe or effective it is \u2013 it matters how big the sample is. Drugs don\u2019t get approved until they have been tested on hundreds or thousands of people, so outcomes for just a dozen or so are highly preliminary and far from proving efficacy.\nBe especially cautious of reports that rely heavily on quotes from drug companies. They are very unlikely to be lying, but institutional press offices have become accustomed to putting a rosy spin on their researchers\u2019 work and drug companies are under commercial pressures that don\u2019t always encourage them to give the full picture. You needn\u2019t be cynical, just cautious.\nWhether Twitter is a handy, up-to-the-minute source of information, or a hive of misinformation and conspiracy theories, is largely up to you. All the usual caveats about using Twitter \u2013 beware of strong opinions from pseudonymous tweeters with 15 followers, or of hot takes from media loudmouths with no expertise \u2013 are multiplied and compounded here. For the problem with the subject of coronavirus on Twitter is that it\u2019s not just the trolls and attention-seekers who are weighing in. Plenty of serious academics, too, have taken it upon themselves to become epidemiologists and virologists overnight, criticising or praising scientific studies or government policies with all the assurance of seasoned veterans. Often what they say is not ignorant or wild, but merely narrow and lacking context \u2013 they might be good at interpreting statistics, say, while having no knowledge of viral transmission or mass behaviour. Fear seems to be causing the usual academic caution to be replaced by hubris.\nAs the site itself says, \u201cAnyone can publish on Medium \u2026 but we don\u2019t fact-check every story.\u201d Make that your starting point for anything you read there.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. But the authoritative-looking stuff you might encounter is probably not coming from experts. One post that went viral, Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance, which used an array of charts and statistics to argue for strong containment measures to avoid massive fatalities, was by Tomas Pueyo, a Silicon Valley consultant who works on educational online content and has no epidemiological training. His post was promoted by a content marketing firm and was shared by the likes of Margaret Atwood and Steven Pinker. Whether or not it was accurate in all its details, it sent out a needed wake-up call about the dangers. But other unqualified \u201ccorona influencers\u201d have spread dangerous messages, for example about hoaxes and bogus treatments. Medium has now announced that it will give \u201ccareful scrutiny to coronavirus-related content to help stem misinformation that could be detrimental to public safety\u201d, and will remove any that it deems harmful.\nFirst ask: does this theory confirm the suspicion I\u2019ve had all along? About, for instance, 5G? Because if so, double your scepticism and then double it again. We aren\u2019t so much duped as flattered into buying these theories, and the first defence against confirmation bias is to recognise that no one has natural immunity to it.\nThe harder ones to avoid are political, because they both speak more directly to our prejudices and are tougher to disprove. Is it \u201cobvious\u201d that, say, the government is just trying to keep its big-business donors happy at the expense of our own safety? We\u2019d do well to assume in the first instance that leaders and policymakers are not Machiavellian strategists but error-prone muddlers like the rest of us.\nSorting fact from fiction is made harder by the media habits acquired during Brexit \u2013 the tendency of broadcast journalists and other media reporters to tweet unattributed and unconfirmed rumours. This grave global crisis should prompt some journalists to take a hard look at the ways they have become accustomed to working.",

        "content": "Enforced closures are crippling a sector that was already in serious trouble\nWhen Debenhams filed for administration last week, it wasn\u2019t just suppliers of its stock, who are owed cash, that felt the pain. There are 22,000 jobs at risk if the retailer cannot be rescued and many of its 142 stores are unlikely to reopen, spelling more trouble for British high streets. And there is also a network of landlords who rely on quarterly rent payments from their shops.\nThe outlook for these landlords was dark enough before the pandemic brought the British economy to its knees. More than 16,000 stores closed last year and the enforced shutdown of cafes, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops is expected to result in thousands more pulling down the shutters for good.\nSince pre-industrial times, landlords and tenants have adhered to a schedule of quarterly rent payments, when annual commercial or agricultural rents were payable in four equal instalments on the \u201cquarter days\u201d, linked to religious festivals.\nThe most recent payday, the second-quarter payment date of 25 March, was a far from harmonious occasion, however. Hammerson, owner of malls such as Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Brent Cross in London, said it had only received 37% of the rent due for the second quarter. Its competitor Intu Properties, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester, received just 29% of second-quarter rents on the due date. London & Associated Properties, which owns the Orchard Square shopping centre in Sheffield, said it had collected about 50% of rent due.\nIt is not just Debenhams, New Look and Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group \u2013 to name just a few of the retailers in deep trouble \u2013 that are seeking help on rent. Vast, profitable businesses such as fast-fashion retailer Primark, sportswear chain JD Sports and Burger King are also refusing to pay their landlords the rent they are due.\nOne major problem is that the government has now allowed commercial tenants to delay rental payments for three months without fear of eviction. Some landlords are furious that certain tenants have interpreted this as permission not to pay.\nSome \u00a32.5bn in retail rents was due at the end of March, according to trade body the British Property Federation (BPF). The property industry, it says, cannot absorb vast losses, because landlords have debts to service.\nMelanie Leech, chief executive of the BPF, is calling for government and regulators to work with lenders to help commercial property businesses. \u201cAs property owners offer relief to their tenants, there is a very strong case for lenders to provide debt service deferral to owners in return, to protect the 45 million savers and pensioners across the country whose money is invested in commercial property,\u201d Leech said.\nSome investors have already been caught up in the property-sector tumult. Investment managers BlackRock and Schroders have both suspended trading in their UK real estate funds, saying it was difficult to obtain an accurate valuation of their assets.\n\u201cLandlords\u201d are treated as one group, although they vary enormously: some are private individuals, some are pension funds. And their approach to pursuing rental income varies also.\nProperty consultancy firm Lorenz Consultancy is currently involved in negotiations between more than 40 hospitality businesses based in London\u2019s West End and their landlords. It says two-thirds of landlords are offering some flexibility. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have transparency between the tenant, landlords and financiers,\u201d said Richard Russell at the consultancy. \u201cThe landlords want to protect income through this, but don\u2019t want to be left with vacant units.\u201d\nSome of the country\u2019s biggest landlords have offered tenants deferred or lower payments, which Cedrik Lachance, an analyst at the property consultancy Green Street, called a \u201cpartnership in pain\u201d. \u201cLandlords who are proactive will get better results over time,\u201d he added.\nProperty firm British Land, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall, has scrapped rent between April and June for smaller tenants, and allowed larger firms to spread rent repayments.\nA number of landlords, however, have called for their lawyers and are threatening immediate legal action. Intu, which has a \u00a34.5bn debt pile and is fighting for survival, has already threatened some tenants with a statutory demand \u2013 a formal request for payment \u2013 if they do not pay.\nAn Intu spokesperson said: \u201cWe are happy to engage with brand customers on a case-by-case basis, but we have neither the desire or financial capacity to bankroll global, well-capitalised brands who have just decided they don\u2019t want to pay their rent.\u201d\nA similar warning has been sent by Criterion Capital, which owns London properties including the Criterion Building on Piccadilly Circus, home for almost a century to the Lillywhites sports store, now operated by billionaire Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct chain. Its letter warns that non-payment of rent will lead to a winding-up petition.\n\u201cThis is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and an entirely inappropriate use of the legal process, which will result in business collapse and administration,\u201d said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, which represents the cafe and restaurant business. The trade body has written to the government asking for an extension to the ban on evictions, from three to six months. UK Hospitality wants the measures widened to prevent property owners from issuing winding-up petitions or statutory demands, a protection already introduced in Germany.\nRussell at Lorenz also believes an extension is needed, as tenants and landlords are already discussing next quarter\u2019s rent. He warns: \u201cThere will be a bloodbath in June if tenants are forced to pay double rent: lots could go to the wall.\u201d",

Yet still we fight on, as we must try to protect all the other precious flora and fauna which is at risk from the HS2 project.\u201d\nA number of MPs wrote to HS2 Ltd\u2019s chief executive, Mark Thurston, last month detailing residents\u2019 concerns about the project and urging him to halt all construction work during the coronavirus emergency.\nThere have been claims that construction teams were ignoring the government\u2019s physical distancing rules during the lockdown.\nThe RSPB has also urged HS2 not to clear woods during the April\u2013September nesting season. Destruction of active birds\u2019 nests is illegal, and the charity has asked local people to report any incidents they see to the police.\nFive ancient woodlands are the focus of HS2 \u201cenabling\u201d works: Broadwells Wood, Birches Wood, Crackley Woods and Ashow Road Wood in Warwickshire and Fulfen Wood in Staffordshire.\nPackham had been seeking an interim injunction from the high court to halt all clearance and construction works. He was also seeking a judicial review of the decision to allow HS2 to proceed, on the basis that it was predicated on the findings and recommendations of the Oakervee review. Packham said the review \u2013 by a former chair of HS2 Ltd \u2013 failed to provide an independent, impartial and rigorous appraisal of relevant environmental and climate change factors.\nCarol Day, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Packham, argued that the high court had failed to \u201cproperly address parts of his claim in relation to the loss of irreplaceable ancient woodlands and climate change\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cHe [Packham] believes that if the government is determined to proceed with this costly and damaging project, it must be on the basis of a full and proper understanding of the environmental impacts. Now more than ever it should be recognised that meeting our international environmental obligations has a vital part to play in protecting nature and human health.\u201d\nA spokesperson for HS2 said all its ecology work was carried out in accordance with the law under the supervision of professionally qualified ecologists. It said licences from Natural England ensured the correct safeguards were in place to protect wildlife.\nIts statement added: \u201cTo ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities in which we are working, only construction sites that can maintain government guidelines and are critical to the delivery of HS2 will remain operational.\u201d\nIt said work had paused at some sites, \u201calthough some sites may remobilise if our contractors are confident they can operate in line with PHE and industry guidance\u201d.\nIt said: \u201cThose sites still working are doing so because they are confident they are operating within PHE guidelines, and will be monitored and remain under constant review.\u201d\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe have tasked HS2 Ltd with delivering one of the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects. While our current priority is combating the spread of coronavirus, we must continue our work to level up the country. HS2 will be crucial to that ambition, boosting capacity and connectivity across our rail network.\u201d",

We know this is a big sacrifice for everyone, but it\u2019s one that has to be made. If the epidemic carries on going in the same direction, we may be able to alter the response, but it will always be done prudently, cautiously, and on the basis of the scientific evidence we have.\u201d\nThe Spanish government has advised people to maintain careful physical distancing as some of those who cannot work from home begin to resume their jobs. It has also said face masks will be handed out at metro and rail stations.",

Hotspots include New York, Detroit, Louisiana and the capital, Washington DC.\nBy Saturday afternoon, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally so far of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 18,860. Italy followed with 18,849.\nIt is unclear how long the US\u2019s patchwork lockdown will need to stay in place, and the federal government has been at odds with regional politicians about everything from supplies of medical equipment to testing and lockdown exit strategies.\n\u201cNo matter how long I live, I don\u2019t think I will ever get over how the US, with all its wealth and technological capability and academic prowess, sleepwalked into the disaster that is unfolding,\u201d Kai Kupferschmidt, a German science writer, told the Associated Press.\nIn Spain there was some hope after a third consecutive fall in the daily death toll that the country may now be reaching the so-called \u201cstabilisation phase\u201d.\nAlthough the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, suggested another month of movement controls were likely, from next week some non-essential workers will be allowed to start returning to their jobs, for example, in factories and construction sites. Masks will be handed out to travellers on public transport.\nWith infections worldwide now over 1.7 million and still climbing fast, however, few governments are expecting a rapid return to normal. Italy and India were among several other countries announcing official extensions to their lockdown periods, although Delhi did not say how long the new controls would last.\nItalians will now be expected to stay home until at least 3 May. With discontent about the long shutdown growing, the interior ministry issued a warning on Saturday about the risk that extremist groups may try to take advantage of the crisis to foment violence.\nThe interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, asked the police to intensify checks owing to \u201cserious tensions\u201d and the risk of \u201criots by groups of extremists\u201d. The mafia have also used the crisis to bolster support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine, authorities said.\nThere is growing consensus worldwide that the only way out of lockdowns \u2013 until a vaccine is found \u2013 is through a combination of testing, contact tracing and tight controls. South Korea is one potential model: at one point it was the worst-hit country outside China, but it has run an extremely successful suppression campaign.\nHowever, it announced that because some of the 57,000 people who have been ordered to stay at home as part of quarantine efforts had been slipping out, it would be issuing tracking wristbands to those who defy orders. At present it is using phones to monitor movement, but people have evaded those checks by simply leaving their devices at home.\nIn a worrying development, South Korean officials on Friday reported that 91 patients thought to be clear of the coronavirus had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus may have been \u201creactivated\u201d rather than the patients being re-infected.\nThe World Health Organization said it was looking into the reports. \u201cWe are closely liaising with our clinical experts and working hard to get more information on those individual cases. It is important to make sure that when samples are collected for testing on suspected patients, procedures are followed properly,\u201d it said.\nThere are also concerns about the spread of coronavirus in Africa after the continent passed the grim milestones of 10,000 confirmed cases and more than 500 deaths, the BBC reported. A shortage of testing capacity in many countries has led to concerns that the spread of the disease may be hard to trace.\nDespite efforts to lock down cities and countries, and despite donations of protective equipment, testing kits and ventilators from China, it is clear Africa has not yet flattened the curve and the room for manoeuvre is getting smaller.\nMeanwhile, in war-divided Cyprus the coronavirus crisis may have offered an unexpected boost to reunification efforts. Officials said the president of the island\u2019s internationally recognised Greek south, Nicos Anastasiades, had agreed to send vital medicines and other materials to the breakaway Turkish-run north after holding talks with the state\u2019s leader, Mustafa Ak\u0131nc\u0131.\nIn China, the government reported three deaths and 46 additional cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday. The number of new daily cases has declined dramatically, allowing the ruling Communist party to reopen factories and stores. China has reported 3,339 deaths and 81,953 confirmed infections, though critics said the real totals might be higher.",

        "content": "Health secretary pledges investigation after telling staff not to overuse equipment\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, has revealed that 19 UK health workers have died after contracting coronavirus, amid further backlash over his request that NHS staff do not overuse protective equipment.\nHancock said on Saturday he was unaware of any link between the deaths and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) but an investigation would be carried out into the extent to which health workers had caught the virus on the frontline.\nHe told Sky News his \u201cheart goes out to their families\u201d and it was \u201cheart-rending\u201d that such a high proportion of the victims were people who migrated to the UK to work for the NHS.\nOn Friday Hancock urged the public to \u201ctreat PPE as the precious resource it is\u201d following weeks of criticism over the lack of vital equipment.\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) dismissed any suggestions that healthcare staff were abusing or overusing PPE. The RCN\u2019s general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday that no PPE was \u201cmore precious a resource than a healthcare worker\u2019s life, a nurse\u2019s life, a doctor\u2019s life\u201d.\nSpeaking later on BBC Breakfast, Kinnair said she was hearing from nurses every day that they did not have enough protective equipment.\nShe said: \u201cI take offence actually that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE. I think what we know is, we don\u2019t have enough supply and not enough regular supply of PPE. This is the number one priority nurses are bringing to my attention. That they do not have adequate supply of protective equipment.\u201d\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said it was insulting to suggest frontline healthcare workers were wasting PPE. He tweeted: \u201cThere are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe. The government must act to ensure supplies are delivered.\u201d\nDr Rinesh Parmar, chair of grassroots union the Doctors\u2019 Association, said it was \u201cunfathomable\u201d that the health secretary was \u201cdeflecting the blame at dedicated frontline workers for the shortages of [PPE]\u201d.\n\u201cAt a time when healthcare workers are also dying from the virus, we\u2019re now seeing blame shifting on to NHS staff who put their lives on the line day after day,\u201d he added. \u201cGuidelines remain conflicting and NHS staff simply want to protect themselves, their patients, colleagues and family members \u2013 this is not too great an ask.\u201d\nThe union claims that official guidance as to what level of protective equipment doctors should wear while resuscitating Covid-19 patients contradicts that of leading medical organisations.\nThe Resuscitation Council UK considers chest compressions to be an \u201caerosol generating procedure\u201d (AGP) and recommends all team members wear a certain level of protective equipment before entering a room where it is being carried out.\nThis recommendation is based upon evidence from around the world and in conjunction with the European Resuscitation Council and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the association said.\nPublic Health England guidance, on the other hand, does not consider the same procedure to be an AGP. First responders can commence chest compressions without that same level of equipment, \u201cwhile awaiting the arrival of other clinicians to undertake airway manoeuvres,\u201d according to its guidance.\nThe row came as it emerged that London\u2019s Kingston hospital NHS foundation trust is set to run out of disposable gowns by Sunday. Intensive care unit staff, among others, have been issued with yellow plastic overalls as a replacement, which they will be tasked with washing.\nThe government has urged the public to stay at home over the Easter holiday to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\nA British scientist has said a coronavirus vaccine could be ready as soon as September. Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told the Times she was \u201c80% confident\u201d the vaccine being developed by her team would work, and human trials were due to begin in the next fortnight.\nShe said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine. It\u2019s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at \u2026 I would go for 80%. That\u2019s my personal view.\u201d\nMost industry experts say a vaccine could take as long as 18 months to be developed and distributed globally. However, Gilbert believes letting volunteers from places that have not imposed lockdowns become infected naturally as soon as possible will accelerate the clinical trial process.\nShe said: \u201cIf one of those [places] turns out to have a high rate of virus transmission then we will get our efficacy results very quickly, so that is one strategy for reducing the time. Total lockdowns do make it harder. But we don\u2019t want the herd immunity either. We want them to be susceptible and exposed for the trials purely to test the efficacy.\u201d\nFor the vaccine to be distributed in the autumn, Gilbert said the government would need to start production before it was proven to work. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get to later this year and discover we have a highly effective vaccine and we haven\u2019t got any vaccine to use.\u201d",

On Friday evening, the SPFL took the unprecedented step of issuing a result with 85% of votes cast.\nThe key domain is the Championship, where one outstanding vote would pass or sink the resolution \u2013 and it then emerged Dundee\u2019s declaration was missing. Dundee had issued a lengthy statement earlier on Friday, stating: \u201cNo member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today. The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of \u00a33.5m-4m lost revenue.\u201d\nThe plot thickened on Saturday afternoon, as the Inverness chief executive, Scot Gardiner, claimed he and other Championship administrators were sent a copy of a Dundee\u2019s no vote via group message on Friday afternoon. Gardiner said the Dundee club secretary followed up with a message of: \u201cDFC vote submitted.\u201d The SPFL say no ballot paper arrived from Dundee. After that came to light, Gardiner said the secretary claimed he had been asked to \u201chold off\u201d resubmitting.\nIn a fierce statement, Rangers said: \u201cWe have been presented with evidence via a whistleblower that raises serious concerns surrounding the SPFL\u2019s processes \u2026 We believe it is in the interests of all Scottish clubs and supporters that the evidence, which is alarming, be addressed as quickly as possible.\u201d\nDouglas Park, recently installed as the Rangers chairman, said: \u201cThe farcical conduct of this affair seems to me to bring the corporate governance and business operations of the SPFL into sharp focus. Other member clubs, who have seen the evidence we hold, share our concerns. We call for the suspension of the SPFL\u2019s chief executive, Neil Doncaster and its legal adviser, Rod McKenzie, while an independent investigation is conducted.\u201d\nMurdoch MacLennan, the SPFL\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cI would expect Douglas Park to present compelling evidence to back up his claims, or to withdraw them.\u201d",

Football can turn on events that seem random, unconnected, unpredictable \u2013 the bounce of a ball, the shape of the goalposts, the eruption of an Icelandic volcano \u2013 or on the unlikely influence of one man.\nTake, for example, the case of Gino Pivatelli, a forward for Bologna, Verona and Napoli who was top scorer in Serie A in 1955-56 and won seven caps for Italy. At the end of his career, he played 37 games for Milan, by which time he had lost some of his pace and sharpness in front of goal. He never managed them. And yet without him, the first two of their eras of European pre-eminence may never have come about.\nMilan\u2019s meeting with Benfica in the 1963 European Cup final was one of those rare crossroad games after which football history takes a decisive turn in a particular direction. Bela Guttmann had left (and cursed) Benfica the previous year in a dispute over his bonus for leading them to successive European titles. Under Fernando Riera, their football remained of the old school, attacking and individualistic. Nereo Rocco\u2019s Milan played a form of catenaccio and it was the mentality that underlay this that led him to pick the 30-year-old Pivatelli rather than Paolo Barison, who had scored six goals in their run to the final. Pivatelli\u2019s job was to mark M\u00e1rio Coluna, Benfica\u2019s left-half and playmaker. It was an overtly negative move. \u201cHe had practical intelligence, common sense and was extremely intuitive,\u201d said the forward Gianni Rivera. \u201cHe always knew where the least expected danger would come from.\u201d\nEus\u00e9bio put Benfica ahead after 18 minutes. Jos\u00e9 Altafini levelled 13 minutes after the break. A minute after that came the decisive moment. Coluna intercepted a Pivatelli pass inside his own half and advanced. Space was opening up. If he\u2019d been able to play the pass, Benfica would have been three on two. But he wasn\u2019t allowed to. Pivatelli closed in, clipped his back leg and brought him down. The attack was thwarted, but worse than that, Coluna had broken a bone in his foot and was forced off. In the days before substitutes it was a decisive blow. Coluna did hobble back on with 10 minutes remaining but it was a gesture, no more. Altafini had added his second 11 minutes after his first, and Milan won 2-1.\nOn the 24th anniversary of the final, RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, gathered Coluna, the Milan captain that day, Cesare Maldini, and the journalist Gianni Min\u00e0 in a studio to watch the game again. \u201cAwful challenge, eh?\u201d Min\u00e0 said after the foul, before broaching directly the suspicion that has always lingered. \u201cLads, after 24 years, can we say whether that foul was ordered or not?\u201d\nMaldini was adamant: \u201cAbsolutely not. Clearly it was a foul, but ...\u201d\nColuna, agitated, silenced him with a wave of the hand, pointing at the screen. \u201cLook how far away the ball is,\u201d he said, through an interpreter. \u201cPivatelli got nowhere near it!\u201d\nThe truth is the foul was cynical rather than malicious. It was late and clearly designed to bring the counter to an end, but it wasn\u2019t the sort of crunching foul that characterised football in the sixties. And besides, if Pivatelli had been acting under instruction to crock Coluna, why wait until nearly an hour had been played? Nonetheless, as Min\u00e0 acknowledged, the foul settled the game. Catenaccio had been validated as a style of play that could win the biggest European trophies.\nThe age of innocence, of Real Madrid and Benfica and all-out attack, of finals that finished 4-3 and 7-3 and 5-3 was over. Rocco \u2013 and two of the same players, Giovanni Trapattoni and Rivera \u2013 added a second European crown six years later. Inter, with their version of catenaccio, won the European Cup in 1964 and 1965, as well as reaching the semi-finals in 1966 and the final in 1967. Pivatelli\u2019s foul, symbolically at least, had been the moment when the Italians and defensive pragmatism took over.\nPivatelli retired that summer at the age of 30 and soon found a job coaching an amateur side in Fusignano, a comune with a population of about 8,000 in the northern province of Ravenna. He had in his squad a right-footed 18-year-old left-back who was enthusiastic but not particularly gifted. \u201cWhen you get the ball,\u201d he told him, \u201cgive it to [the playmaker] Pollini.\u201d But the full-back wasn\u2019t happy with that, less, it seemed, because it diminished his own role than because he felt football shouldn\u2019t be played like that. Eventually Pivatelli had to tell him that he would never be a regular starter; he just wasn\u2019t good enough.\nFor the full-back, it was the first major turning point in his life. He gave up his dreams of being a player and decided to become a coach, to put into practice his belief that there shouldn\u2019t be just one playmaker but that every player in the team should be a protagonist. It took a long time, but Arrigo Sacchi did become a coach. Twenty years later he took charge of Parma and, after his then Serie B side beat Milan in the 1986\u201187 Coppa Italia, he was made manager of the Rossoneri. Within three years Milan had won two more European Cups and, more than that, their hard pressing style had redefined Italian football.\nWhat if Pivatelli hadn\u2019t been so decisive? What if Sacchi had hung on playing low-level amateur football? There were many other factors in Milan\u2019s late-80s rise under the presidency of Silvio Berlusconi, but that detail was critical. Pivatelli, with a foul and some straight words to a teenager, incidents a little over a year apart, twice transformed the history of the club. Plans are important but, sometimes, stuff just happens.",

        "content": "Residents of the city where the virus was first detected are taking cautious steps outside after being confined for three months\nLast week the city of Wuhan celebrated the end of its nearly three-month lockdown. Flower beds and trees were planted in parks across from hospitals previously overwhelmed with panicked and sick patients. The streets have been scrubbed clean.\nBefore midnight last Wednesday, when restrictions barring people from leaving the city were officially lifted, state news outlets sent drones into the sky to film lit-up buildings and bridges. Cars lined up at motorway tollbooths, waiting to leave. Drivers described feeling finally \u201cliberated\u201d. Several housing developments had flags declaring them \u201cvirus free\u201d. One said: \u201cDecisive battle, decisive win.\u201d\nBut for many in the city of 11 million, where at least 2,500 have died from the coronavirus, it has not feel much like a release. \u201cWe haven\u2019t felt much of a change,\u201d said Zhang, 50, who lives in the district of Wuchang and has been quarantining at home. \u201cFor regular people, the lockdown is not over.\u201d\nWuhan\u2019s exit from lockdown is part of a broader effort by Chinese officials to assure the public that life can return to normal and that authorities have beaten the virus.\n\u201cThe high-profile re-opening of Wuhan is meant to send a signal that China is getting back to business and work can be resumed. But despite the government efforts, people will be still very cautious,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a lecturer in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cPeople can\u2019t easily forget the government\u2019s early missteps in causing the crisis, particularly for those who lost their loved ones or have their health severely impaired.\u201d\nIn the city, many shops remain closed, with restaurants reopening only for deliveries. Schools, cinemas and other entertainment venues remain shut. Many neighbourhoods are still sealed off, with only those with permission from their employers able to leave regularly to go back to work. While people are freer to come and go, there are constant checkpoints where residents must show their \u201chealth code\u201d and have their temperatures taken. Zhang says he has to go through four just to get to his local bus stop.\nThe continued restrictions, which authorities have said will be lifted in a \u201cgradual and orderly manner\u201d, are an indication that the epidemic \u2013 while much eased\u2013 is not over.\nMany residents are still worried about the number of asymptomatic patients, as well as released patients who retest as positive but do not show symptoms. Others worry about the number of imported cases, as Chinese travellers return from infected countries. Yesterday the National Health Commission reported 46 new cases from the day before, all but four of them from abroad. Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, has seen no new cases for seven days.\n\u201cWe are still worried and will stay inside. There are still people who have come out that are retesting positive,\u201d said Zhou, 68, who lives in Hankou and who had ventured outside of her home for the first time in two months.\nOthers said they were eager to return to work but still worried about the possibility of a second outbreak. \u201cGoing back to normal doesn\u2019t mean the virus disappears,\u201d said Iris Yao, 41, who also lives in Hankou.\nAt a recently reopened convenience store just outside Wuhan Youfu Hospital near the Huanan Seafood market where cases were first detected, a store owner said she would not have returned to work if she did not have to. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come out, I can\u2019t make money and I cannot eat. If I could, I would stay home,\u201d she said.\nSeveral said their neighbourhoods, after loosening restrictions, had become strict again. Some suspected new infections had emerged. Others said they did not trust what was officially reported. Coco Han, 22, who was infected with the virus in January, remembered how her compound in Wuchang still posted its \u201cvirus free\u201d sign even when she was at home sick.\nBut residents also said they believed the government had made up for early missteps, including being slow to alert the public about the virus and suppressing doctors who attempted to warn residents.\nChen, 60, from the city of Yichang, which was also placed under strict travel curbs at the beginning of the outbreak, had just returned to Wuhan to go back to work. He was proud of the government\u2019s efforts to contain the virus. \u201cThe government and the country banded together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe party really puts the people first.\u201d\nAcross the city, the after-effects of the epidemic are visible. At a funeral home in Wuchang district, relatives of those who have died over the last two months are still coming to retrieve their ashes. A tent has been put up to house those waiting, with plastic chairs spaced one metre apart. Local residents said that in recent weeks the funeral home had had to limit the number of people who could come to 100 a day.\nZhang, whose daughter is studying in Hong Kong, does not want her to come back yet because he does not believe it is safe enough. \u201cSome people believe the disaster is over, but there are also people who don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe danger here is not necessarily bigger than in other Chinese cities, but it is there. From regular people to the government, everyone knows it.\u201d\n This article was amended on 12 April 2020 to change the headline to more accurately reflect the content of the piece.",

        "content": "As virus death toll nears 10,000, Labour leader Keir Starmer calls for talks with Speaker\n Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates\n See all our coronavirus coverage\nThe government faces a chorus of cross-party calls on Sunday for the urgent recall of parliament in \u201cvirtual\u201d form as MPs and peers demand the right to hold ministers to account over the escalating coronavirus crisis.\nThe demands from leaders of all main opposition parties, as well as senior Tories, came after the death toll from Covid-19 in the UK approached 10,000. Deaths from the virus rose by 917 on Saturday compared with Friday to a total of 9,875.\nFronting the daily Covid-19 briefing for the first time, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said the figures showed the \u201cdevastating impact of this virus\u201d.\nAlthough there was a slight drop in numbers between Friday and Saturday, experts warned that the coming week could see a significant jump.\n\u201cThis is Easter weekend, and that will have affected numbers of reports of deaths,\u201d said David Spielgelhalter, a Cambridge University statistician.\n\u201cI would expect there will be a catch-up this week and a massive spike in numbers of daily deaths being reported on Wednesday or Thursday. Only in the following days will we see if we are reaching a plateau in deaths.\u201d\nIn her first-ever Easter audio message to the nation, the Queen on Saturday urged people to have hope and look forward to better times, with the words: \u201cWe know that coronavirus will not overcome us.\u201d\nBut with concerns growing that the peak may be some way off, and questions mounting over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic while the prime minister, Boris Johnson, remains in hospital, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said parliament had to be recalled as soon as possible.\nIn a letter to the Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in which he demands urgent talks with the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, Starmer said there was \u201cno substitute for parliamentary scrutiny\u201d particularly \u201cat this time of national crisis\u201d.\n\u201cThe best decisions are those that are challenged and subject to scrutiny. And by that process issues can be resolved, mistakes quickly rectified and individual concerns addressed. That will help save lives and protect our country. But if parliament is not sitting or functioning effectively that cannot happen.\u201d\nAll parliamentary business was suspended on 25 March because of fears that MPs would contract the virus while working in close proximity. There was also concern that they would spread Covid-19 when returning to their constituencies.\nWhile the parliamentary website says MPs will return to Westminster on 21 April, few believe there is any chance of this happening. But no alternative arrangements for virtual sessions have been announced.\nOne senior Labour source said: \u201cI don\u2019t think this government wants parliament to return as it will allow MPs to focus on ways they are messing things up. That\u2019s why they like daily press conferences. They give them a chance to control everything.\u201d\nPatel said discussions were taking place over how parliament would resume and function. However, she insisted all focus was currently on dealing with the pandemic. \u201cI think at this particular time, we have to focus the resources of government, all our energies, every single sinew of government, focusing on saving lives and dealing with this awful disease.\u201d\nThe SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said it was essential that parliament returned to work in a virtual form this week. This should include a virtual \u201cquestion time\u201d with whoever was standing in for Johnson, using a similar model to the video questions session with Nicola Sturgeon in the Scottish parliament.\nBlackford said he found it astonishing that he had yet to be asked to a confidential briefing on privy council terms by Downing Street. He also revealed that he had written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, more than two weeks ago raising concerns about whether money would get to the most needy but had had no reply. \u201cThis is simply not acceptable,\u201d he said.\nThe Tory MP David Davis, a former cabinet minister, went further saying MPs should return to Westminster in person as soon as possible and subject themselves to daily tests for Covid-19 if necessary. \u201dThe House of Commons met when air raids were going on in the war. I think it needs to be reconstituted even if it means MPs being tested every day,\u201d Davis said.\nThe acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said the lack of parliamentary scrutiny at this time was \u201cintolerable\u201d and could not be allowed to continue.\nThe Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhile parliament can\u2019t yet return to Westminster, the technology exists to enable a far greater level of remote accountability, even if it won\u2019t be able to exactly replicate the way parliament normally functions. It isn\u2019t lack of technology that\u2019s preventing recall \u2013 it\u2019s lack of political will. Other parliaments are already doing it \u2013 Westminster needs to urgently do the same.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, whose father was a bus driver in the capital, says in an article for the Observer online that he is exploring how protective equipment could be given to London\u2019s transport workers. By the middle of last week nine London bus drivers had died from Covid-19.\nAsked to apologise for the lack of personal protective equipment, Patel said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if people feel there have been failings.\u201d She conceded that there had been \u201cdistribution issues\u201d as a result of global demand for PPE and that there was now a \u201cclear plan\u201d for delivering it.\nPatel also launched a public awareness campaign aimed at protecting those at risk of domestic abuse. In the West Midlands alone, it was revealed that 400 domestic abuse suspects have been arrested in the last fortnight.\nAs government experts continue to say the number of people with Covid-19 entering hospital is levelling off, an Opinium poll for the Observer finds support for their handling of the pandemic has grown since last week, from 52% to 61%.\n This article was amended on 12 April 2020 to add a comment from the Green MP Caroline Lucas that was omitted during the editing process.",

        "content": "Regional and remote communities have fewer resources to fight coronavirus, but many also see potential gains from a more digitally connected Australia\nIt\u2019s odd, this coronavirus, viewed from a small rural town. The wall-to-wall news coverage that bookmarks all our days is contrary to the rhythm of our lives.\nOn a broadacre farm, work that is already isolated has not changed apart from the little things. We wipe down tractors and vehicles. We are feeding family who have returned home to wait out peak virus, while trying to ensure connectivity can handle online university lectures and work conferences.\nAgricultural supplies need to be phoned in ahead and the usual inputs \u2013 seed, spare parts and chemicals \u2013 are in high demand.\nA trip to town, though, reveals the extent of lockdown. Pubs and cafes, beauty parlours and gift shops have temporarily closed. With streets already containing a fair share of empty premises, it is alarming.\nThe supermarket \u2013 an independent \u2013 is busier than ever, but they are having trouble filling their orders. Pasta, baking and toilet paper supplies are still low or missing.\nThe majority of the chemist\u2019s shop space is roped off. Products are delivered by staff to ensure goods are not cross-contaminated. A small-town pharmacy is the frontline for supplies and advice. The flu vaccines have run out at the beginning of the season.\nDown the road, the cafes and pubs in a popular tourist stop have pivoted to takeaway. Business owners urge customers to avoid their local catch-up on the way through. Police drive past to monitor social distancing.\nIt is discombobulating, but people are not complaining. A common theme is how lucky we are not to live in a densely populated city.\nIf there is anxiety, it is about the availability of testing and the time taken for results. People with Covid-like symptoms have been perturbed by the strict criteria and limited test kits.\nThis is particularly true for health workers, who need to be removed from rosters if suspected and tested. A test result that might take eight hours in the city is more like three or four days turnaround and in some rural parts up to a week, potentially leaving a big chunk in a health service roster.\nAmanda Kenny, a professor of rural health at La Trobe university, describes a typical small-town health service which may have one or two doctors as well as a working roster of nurses, office staff and cleaners, who are all potentially exposed.\nOften those hospitals, like my local, also double as aged care facilities, which increases the degree of difficulty for staff working across the building. The same doctors often service both their general practice and the emergency ward of a small hospital.\n\u201cThe biggest risks for smaller communities are the workforce issues,\u201d Kenny says. \u201cSmaller services are at risk of GPs getting sick. If they become infected, what do you do when there\u2019s no other medical staff?\u201d\nKenny commends telehealth initiatives, but says more support is needed, in particular for older people, whose visits to their GP are important not just for health but also for emotional connection.\nDr Joe McGirr, independent MP for the New South Wales seat of Wagga Wagga and an emergency doctor, is particularly concerned about social isolation for older people who do not have access via the internet.\n\u201cThese are the people who walk down to the newsagents every day to pick up a paper and they run into a few people on the way. That is their news service. They don\u2019t have Facebook,\u201d McGirr says.\nFor many rural and remote towns, the Royal Flying Doctor Service will deliver medical services and also evacuate patients to bigger hospitals.\nFederation executive director Frank Quinlan says the the RFDS faces an unusual tension to ensure it can get into communities to provide medical services and evacuations, without carrying the virus into already isolated places.\n\u201cAll these communities are experiencing the same health issues they would be experiencing without the [Covid-19],\u201d Quinlan says. \u201cTransportation with people experiencing infectious diseases, or suspected, is a routine part of our business so we are well set up.\u201d\nThe virus outbreak closely followed the horrendous summer of bushfires in the eastern states, and the need to isolate has effectively closed down bushfire recovery centres designed to support communities coping with losses of properties, businesses and livestock.\nTowns such as Batlow and Tumbarumba in NSW were badly hit, losing significant parts of their orchard and softwood industries. Internet connectivity is an issue in those areas as well, making home-schooling and business frustrating and exacerbating the difficulties of lockdown.\nIn Western Australia, Wongan Hills pork, orange and wheat grower Sue Middleton has spent the past two months rearranging her workforce to allow for isolation and keep employees healthy, protect families and to allow products to continue to markets.\nShe ships pork to Singapore and elsewhere, so she has welcomed the federal government\u2019s export assistance, after the lack of carrying capacity increased freight charges for her business by six times.\nMiddleton says connectivity remains a huge issue but is hopeful that if that hurdle can be solved, rural Australia will emerge in a more competitive place to attract population.\nShe believes if telehealth and connectivity were strengthened, rural communities could compete with the comparative advantages of cities that provide jobs and access to health.\n\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for rural Australia,\u201d she says.\nAndrew Vann, the vice-chancellor of Charles Sturt University, Orange, says regional universities are well set up to provide external services, but he is concerned at the hit on regional economies.\n\u201cWe are worried about the loss of economic capacity, we need to be here to train people,\u201d Vann says. \u201cThere is a risk to the economic future of regional Australia in all of these towns.\u201d\nBut, like Middleton, he is bullish about rural futures.\n\u201cI think the tide was already turning in favour of regional Australia,\u201d Vann says. \u201cI think people will say, do I really want to be with 6 million people when I\u2019ve discovered I can work from home?\u201d",

There are also protections for abortion clinics against so-called targeted regulations of abortion providers restrictions that campaigners say obstruct their constitutionally-protected rights to a procedure.\n\u201cNo more will legislators in Richmond, most of whom are men, be telling women what they should and should not be doing with their bodies,\u201d Northam said. \u201cThe Act will make women and families safer.\u201d\nOn Saturday, Northam signed the Virginia Values Act, which he said \u201csends a strong, clear message \u2013 Virginia is a place where all people are welcome to live, work, visit, and raise a family.\u201d\nAccording to an official release, the VVA \u201cprohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, public and private employment, public accommodations, and access to credit.\n\u201cThe legislation also extends important protections \u2026 on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, marital status, disability, and status as a veteran.\u201d\nNortham said: \u201cWe are building an inclusive Commonwealth where there is opportunity for everyone, and everyone is treated fairly. No longer will LGBTQ Virginians have to fear being fired, evicted, or denied service in public places because of who they are.\u201d\nVirginia previously had some of the most restrictive abortion laws, and loosest gun freedoms, in the country.\nIn November, after the Republicans were swept from both state houses, having controlled one or both for a quarter-century, the New York Times examined the reasons why traditional Republican voters in Virginia had abandoned the party, especially in the suburbs. The first interviewee it quoted cited gun control.\nThe new measures did not find favor with everybody in the state, however. Virginia\u2019s Catholic bishops attacked the governor for signing the abortion law on Good Friday.\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened and disappointed by his signature of this legislation,\u201d Bishops Michael Burbidge and Barry Knestout said in a statement. \u201cThat he would take this action on Good Friday, one of the most solemn days for Christians, is a particular affront to all who profess the Gospel of life.\u201d",

He was admitted on Sunday and remains in hospital. Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care, said he \u201ccan\u2019t thank them enough\u201d.\nFor the first time in history, all 50 US states have come under disaster declarations. Wyoming became the 50th state, following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. The US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are also under the declarations, which enable federal funds to be used by state and local governments.\nOpposition parties across the UK and senior Conservatives have united to demand that parliament be recalled. In a letter to the leader of the Commons, newly elected Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded urgent talks with the Speaker, saying that there was no substitute for parliamentary scrutiny particularly \u201cat this time of national crisis\u201d.\nA World Health Organization official urged Belarus to impose measures to contain coronavirus, as the country enters \u201ca new phase\u201d of the virus. President Alexander Lukashenko has been downplaying the need for restrictive measures in recent weeks, and said that drinking vodka, driving tractors and bathing in a sauna could help fight the virus. Patrick O\u2019Connor, who led a WHO delegation to Belarus this week, warned that the virus had begun spreading through communities in the capital Minsk and parts of the country.\nThe Kremlin said that the \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus patients was beginning to put a strain on Moscow\u2019s hospitals. The city and other regions have been in lockdown for almost two weeks, but the hospitals in the capital are still stretched. \u201cThe situation in both Moscow and St Petersburg, but mostly in Moscow, is quite tense because the number of sick people is growing,\u201d Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nSeven countries have demanded that China address their concerns that Africans living in Guangzhou city are being mistreated and harassed. The countries claim African residents have been targeted out of fear coronavirus could spread through imported cases. In recent days Africans in the city have reported being ejected from their apartments by landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results, and being shunned and discriminated against in public.\nPope Francis urged people to \u201cnot yield to fear\u201d and focused on a \u201cmessage of hope\u201d as he led an Easter eve mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica on Saturday. The vigil was scaled back due to coronavirus, with just two dozen attendees compared with the usual 10,000, a smaller choir, and the elimination of several traditional features such as baptisms and processions.",

This is a massive call on the public purse and it is a debt that the country will pay for years to come and at six million people on the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s nearly half the Australian workforce.\u201d\nAsked if tax increases would be needed to pay back fresh debt, Frydenberg replied that \u201cit will be paid back in the years ahead\u201d.\n\u201cBut, again, we approach this crisis with about a quarter of the debt to GDP ratio of the US, of the UK, and about one seventh of what it is in Japan.\n\u201cThe way to meet that growing debt burden will be to grow the economy.\u201d\nFrydenberg said the Liberal party is \u201cthe party of lower tax\u201d and claimed its track record showed it could restrain government spending. \u201cWe are going to have to climb that mountain again.\u201d\nFrydenberg talked tough about the need to fight Covid-19, which he described as a \u201cfaceless and flagless enemy\u201d but warned that \u2013 despite the prime minister\u2019s call to protect Australia\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 the current crisis is \u201cnot an argument for protectionism\u201d.\nEarlier, McCormack said \u201cthe recovery out the other side is going to need that [tax reform]\u201d.\n\u201cI think the expenditure review committee and the states will be having a large say in that,\u201d he told Sky News.\nMcCormack claimed the Coalition knew how to \u201cmanage money\u201d but said the federal government would \u201cneed the help of Labor states and territories, through the [Council of Australian Governments] process and the national cabinet being its best self\u201d to manage tax reform.\nOn Sunday the education minister, Dan Tehan, guaranteed that the federal government will pay $18bn in commonwealth grant scheme funding to universities this year regardless of whether they meet the student numbers estimated at the time of the 2019 budget.",

        "content": "Whatever happens on the far side, professional sport cannot come back pretending it\u2019s all that matters now that we\u2019ve seen a world without it\nFor a while when the coronavirus first hit Australia, the main concern was apparently for professional sport. Footy might die, was the summation from the suits in charge. Footy could mean any code, take your pick. In a country shut down, the empty streets meant empty grandstands, empty changerooms, empty training fields. Any game that ceased its frantic treadmill would cease to exist. Forget planning for the other side of the crisis, there was no other side to reach.\nIt\u2019s April now and in the south the weather has started to turn, interspersing an hour of sun on yellow maple leaves or early wattle blossom with the first cold fronts lashing the Victorian coast. My mind and my year should be turning to football, deep enough into the season to start worrying about an early trend, a half-back\u2019s ankle, a road trip coming up.\nI\u2019m not thinking about it at all, though. Except for this moment of thinking about what I\u2019m not thinking about. I\u2019m thinking about friends cooped up and going mad, about creative fervour, about depressive dead ends, about the chasm between safe and unsafe shelter, about using the internet to make a sparse few people smile. I\u2019m thinking about loving New York City, and about how it\u2019s a ghost town now in every sense. I\u2019m thinking about the cigarettes and plazas of Spain and Italy, and what came of them. I\u2019m thinking about the placid blank of China\u2019s information firewall, and the futility of reporting numbers from India when millions of its residents don\u2019t have their existence acknowledged at all.\nFor those not facing eviction or infection, with enough space that isolation isn\u2019t a prison, the quietness has its good side. There\u2019s no anxiety about whether three wins in a row means my team is bound to crash, or three losses in a row means we\u2019re so behind we can\u2019t get back. If footy were here we would be saturated with it, life and death on the talkback line, breathless punditry about the Doggies\u2019 defence and which Instagram post was disrespectful and which coach would be first sacked, before debating some attention-seeking deadshittery from a former player whose new job description is to be an attention-seeking deadshit. I don\u2019t look out my window at the sun on the foliage and think that my world is missing football. I look out the window and feel still.\nPerhaps more of us than expected aren\u2019t missing it that much. Perhaps football is habit, ceaselessly reinforced by those whose lives are devoted to pushing it. A mate in Ballarat messaged me while contemplating its main oval. \u201cThe amount of man hours that go into it is astonishing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHuge amounts of money and fertiliser. Endless gazing and discussion.\u201d He wondered what custodians across the world would do with a long-term chance to tend their battered turf. The thought of humans passing quiet months, carefully caring for a patch of grass, seemed like the sort of thing our world could do with.\nOf course there are people who\u2019ll be hit harder by footy\u2019s absence. Not just those whose jobs are gone, those for whom sport forms a more central part of their life or sense of self. But the pro leagues that demand all the attention are not the major loss. All social sport is cancelled, every clubhouse empty, every ledger heading closer to oblivion. Losing this hurts more: all the people for whom their local club is one of the points that life coheres around, whether as players or members. Their chance to see friendly faces, swap stories, be part of something that is at once safely familiar but sufficiently bigger than themselves.\nIf this loss were to continue through the Australian winter, into the next spring, the sense of sadness would grow alongside. All the in-built brick barbecues abandoned as the weather swings upward, the grounds trod fleetingly by a few runners for their police-approved daily exercise. The small cricket clubs toppling after the footy clubs.\nWhatever happens on the far side, professional sport can\u2019t come back pretending it\u2019s as important as when it left. We\u2019ve seen a world without it. Premier League clubs that have sacked their staff and taken public money can\u2019t throw around transfer bonuses when the grift-mill starts again. Clubs in a global recession can\u2019t pay a defensive midfielder \u00a3300,000 a week. Australian codes can\u2019t pretend that the season is sacrosanct, that the One Day in September or the opening round or the State of Origin may not be trifled with. Nature doesn\u2019t give a fuck about Wally Lewis.\nTo be clear, though, when the administrators say that their sport might die, they really mean their administrations might die. That\u2019s their worry. When you look around the sporting landscape, you wonder if that would be such a bad thing after all. Most of the organisations right now are exactly as they were. The National Rugby League is a bloviating mess. Football Federation Australia is hanging on by its fingernails. Rugby Australia has already let go. The Australian Football League has assets and some calm, but there is also a degree of panic swirling in the air.\nFFA is best known for brawling with its fans and sucking up to a corrupt Fifa. The national team will politely try to qualify for the 2022 World Cup awarded to Qatar, bought with bribes and built on the bodies of indentured labourers. Only a few weeks ago the A-League nearly saw one of its teams sold to an embarrassingly small-time cryptocurrency shyster in London. Rugby Australia\u2019s most-watched recent contest was its legal fight with Israel Folau, who preached love for his sport and Christian modesty before kicking a multi-million dollar hole in the Wallabies after being sacked for breach of contract.\nFFA and RA have the same Rupert Murdoch problem: a drip-feed of Fox Sports funding that they can\u2019t live without, while its paywall keeps their domestic leagues undernourished. Now that they\u2019re hooked, Foxtel is trying to ease its own disastrous finances by threatening to abandon A-League football, and offering rugby one third of the previous deal. When RA boss Raelene Castle looked for a free-to-air broadcaster, Murdoch\u2019s newspapers launched an assault, insisting Castle would be sacked for having \u201cfailed to secure\u201d a deal.\nNext to these hot messes is the NRL, whose parent body is chaired by Peter V\u2019landys who also heads up Racing New South Wales. His triumphs there? Saying that the 160-year-old Melbourne Cup should move dates to accommodate a race he made up in 2017. Getting a pliable state premier to run ads for that race on the sails of the Sydney Opera House. The Four Corners episode where he insisted that NSW racehorses had happy retirements, in between footage of them being killed in abattoirs. V\u2019landys is now suing the ABC for not warning him they had the slaughter footage.\nThis is the quality at rugby league\u2019s disposal. By 15 March, before any lockdown orders had been given or emergency declared, V\u2019landys was demanding taxpayer cash. \u201cAn Australia without rugby league is not Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s not of our own doing, and that\u2019s why we need federal government support. We didn\u2019t do this.\u201d By his description, the NRL was a few months from ruin.\nSo a league that brags about its billion-dollar broadcast deals had its hand out before a match was even postponed. Its own broadcaster, the Nine Network, said \u201cwe now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on \u2026 squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters.\u201d V\u2019landys hung on grimly before pausing the season, and is back out already claiming it will resume in May, apparently annoyed that the worst local pandemic predictions from the league\u2019s scientific adviser have been averted.\nTasking the resumption to an \u201cinnovation committee\u201d is gag-worthy enough. Naming it Project Apollo, after an immaculate mission that landed a literal moonshot, is exactly the sort of insanely inflated self-regard that powers the NRL. They haven\u2019t asked approval from NSW\u2019s health minister or premier, because they have a letter from the police commissioner saying that players could be exempt from lockdown if classed as workers. \u201cIn reality we could [resume] tomorrow if we wanted to,\u201d said V\u2019landys on Saturday.\nWhat he hasn\u2019t explained is how 30 players squirming all over each other for hours can meet the spacing and hygiene requirements of shared workplaces. Nor addressed how the country\u2019s most-watched sporting competition could undermine the public approach to isolation. What matters to the NRL is that the show goes on, because that means the cash goes on. On an island, on a boat, on a plane, on a train: play those matches anywhere, so the accountants can stay one row ahead of their vanishing margins.\nSo if some or all of these institutions hit the wall, what would we stand to lose? Money would stop flowing to some places where it does good, but the same money would exist to flow elsewhere. We\u2019d see the end of some kingdoms that have somehow been built. In time we would get others rising in their place. They might be better, might be worse. None of them realise how little they matter.\nIf the National Rugby League falls over, rugby league will still be here. If the Australian Football League falls over, Aussie rules will still be here. It\u2019s in our blood and in our bootlaces, in our muddy laundry and windburned faces. As soon as the lockdown ends, kids who still dream big and creaky adults who already know better will pick up a football and trot from their homes, easing the game back into muscles that haven\u2019t known it for some time. They will head to their local fields, gather at whichever clubs remain, reanimate some or start them new, and form them back into leagues. Some of these clubs will collaborate, and some leagues will end up on television or radio, because there are those of us who love to follow what they play.\nThese are our games, taken by others who package them and sell them back to us. Our administrator friends look at this quiet April and the changing colour of the leaves, and see like Clive James an onrushing death. \u201cA final flood of colours will live on / as my mind dies / Burned by my vision of a world that shone / So brightly at the last, and then was gone.\u201d But this season is not the game, this club is not the game, this person is not the game. For the rest of us, free of this single-minded conception, the turning of the leaves is another life cycle, and life goes on. Here we are in Australia, lucky on the fringes in a worldwide fight. Footy is not as important as we thought it was. Footy will be just fine.",

Extending that cancellation to payments due in 2021 would make another US$24.9bn immediately available to help counter the virus.\nCoordinator of the Asian People\u2019s Movement on Debt and Development, Lidy Nacpil, said hundreds of millions of people in the world\u2019s most impoverished countries were facing devastating health, social and economic crises as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic that their governments were ill-equipped and under-resourced to counter.\n\u201cPermanently cancelling debt payments from these countries would be the fastest way to free up existing public resources to tackle this unprecedented crisis and to save lives,\u201d Nacpil said.\nIn Australia, Jubilee Australia, Action Aid Australia, Caritas Australia, Oxfam Australia, AID/WATCH, Union Aid Abroad-APHEDA, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, and the International Women\u2019s Development Agency have written to treasurer Josh Frydenberg urging him to support debt cancellation, arguing that the Covid-19 pandemic will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people in the most vulnerable countries.\n\u201cThe Covid-19 virus brings with it both a health and an economic crisis. Without swift action now to bolster fragile and overstretched health systems and testing in low-income countries, there are grave risks of further spread of the virus,\u201d the letter says.\n\u201cWhilst the impacts will be felt by all of us, it is the most vulnerable and marginalised in low-income-countries, including women and girls, who will be hardest hit.\u201d\nAustralia should also support the provision of new emergency finance, given as grants not loans to vulnerable countries, so as to avoid creating even more debt for the future; and the establishment of a UN-led permanent mechanism to resolve future debt crises, a public statement from the group argues.\nAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison told a virtual G20 summit last week that Australia\u2019s \u201cPacific family\u201d must be a focus of international support, and said the government was \u201creconfiguring our development assistance to ensure critical health services can continue to function and to help our Pacific neighbours and Timor-Leste to manage the immediate economic impacts of the pandemic\u201d.\nAlex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, said Australia\u2019s high commissions and embassies across the region remain open, and the government was working with Pacific governments to \u201cmitigate the economic shock\u201d beyond the immediate health crisis. The World Bank and IMF have already indicated a preparedness to suspend or forgive debt. Last month in a joint statement, they called for all bilateral creditors to suspend debt repayments from low-income countries that request forbearance.\n\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak is likely to have severe economic and social consequences for International Development Assistance countries, home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population and two-thirds of the world\u2019s population living in extreme poverty,\u201d the statement said.\nThe authors of a report by the Harvard Kennedy School of Policy Analysis for the US State Department on Chinese \u201cdeptbook diplomacy\u201d have warned that the global economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic could give China the ability take control of indebted nations\u2019 assets at an accelerated rate, or boost its soft power, by forgiving debt.\n\u201cWhatever debt leverage China had over countries is going to increase,\u201d the report\u2019s co-author, Sam Parker said. \u201cWhatever bad consequences were going to happen as a result of being unable to repay China, I think the timeline could be severely accelerated.\u201d",

        "content": "Rishi Sunak avoided calling the Bank of England last week to beg for an extension of the Treasury\u2019s overdraft facility to meet his Covid-19 spending commitments.\nThe chancellor was saved that job by Andrew Bailey, the central bank\u2019s governor, who saw the red flashing signs on the side of the Treasury\u2019s headquarters from his Threadneedle Street offices almost three miles away. In a joint statement, the Treasury and the Bank said they had agreed to extend the use of the \u201cways and means\u201d facility as a temporary measure during the disruption caused by Covid-19.\nAt the moment the Treasury has a standing facility of \u00a3400m that can be drawn on instantly and without discussion. What the total will be in a year\u2019s time is not known, but analysts who have attempted to estimate the UK\u2019s likely spending shortfall have settled on \u00a3200bn, give or take \u00a350bn.\nBailey has strenuously denied that the central bank is now the Treasury\u2019s slave after adding the overdraft facility to a \u00a3200bn quantitative easing boost announced last month, insisting that temporary means temporary. He is certainly right to say that there is a precedent for the Bank providing instant cash. Back in 2008 it extended almost \u00a320bn to the then Labour chancellor, Alistair Darling, via the ways and means facility as he battled to save the financial services industry from going bust.\nAn extra \u00a3200bn of debts \u2013 no matter how they are apportioned by the Bank \u2013 would frighten most people, and there are some officials in the Treasury who are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the UK\u2019s expected 2020 borrowing. Sunak, though, is understood to be reconciled to running up the largest debt mountain in peacetime.\nYet Bailey and Sunak cannot argue that such a large debt can in any way be considered temporary. Whether the loan sits inside the ways and means facility or is more obviously added to the Bank\u2019s quantitative-easing lending scheme, which has accumulated \u00a3435bn of government debt, it will be too large to pay down in a matter of months, years, or even decades.\nIn 2005 the national debt stood at \u00a3500bn. By 2010 it was \u00a31 trillion and it now stands at just over \u00a31.8tn. The economy has grown in that time, but not by much. From a debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005 below 40%, the ratio is now around 86%.\nSo the question must then be: does the UK face another long period of austerity, as it did after the first and second world wars and following the 2008 financial crisis, or does something else happen to the loans made by the Bank of England, and government debt more generally?\nSunak was keen to point out in his March budget that the ups and downs of Britain\u2019s debts have made little difference to the tumbling cost of financing them. In the year after the second world war finished, debt payments accounted for more than 14% of government spending. Last year that figure was below 4%.\nEveryone with money, it seems, wants to play safe by lending their savings to governments with a strong record of paying the interest on their debts.\nIn this environment, when large numbers of investors are content with receiving interest of less than 1%, the Bank and the government can work together to finance huge debts without diverting funds from the public purse.\nTemporary debts can become permanent, and a new era of monetary financing \u2013 where the Bank prints new money for the government to spend \u2013 dawns. The sooner we admit this and plot a course of action, the better.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a humbling, once-in-a-century phenomenon that has drawn historical comparisons with societies under the siege of war. It could also be an event that triggers an economic levelling on a global scale too, just as developed nations experienced a radical reduction in inequality after the second world war.\nFor now, it is a case of watching the damage being wrought. The long-term scarring to national economies is already in evidence, with more than 16 million unemployed in the US, 1.2 million applications for universal credit in the UK and Germany widely forecast to be entering a deep recession.\nBut then will come the healing. The repairs to developed economies, which are already building up ballooning deficits, will be costly. Trillions of dollars will have been spent by governments on furlough schemes, emergency lending programmes and extra health funding. The bill will have to be met.\nThe options to pay for this will fall between well-drawn policy lines: austerity, or higher taxes. The political calculus in many countries \u2013 the UK included \u2013 will probably be that more austerity is unsustainable because no electorate will tolerate it. Which leaves the spotlight on taxes \u2013 and the rich.\nThe reaction of the world\u2019s most notable billionaires has so far been commendable: $100m from the world\u2019s richest man, Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, to American food banks; $1bn from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey towards battling the pandemic; and $100m from Bill and Melinda Gates towards vaccines.\nThe world\u2019s 2,153 billionaires hold more wealth than 4.6 billion of their fellows on Earth, according to Oxfam. If that imbalance seemed intolerable before, it cannot be borne now. With a global economy on its knees, meaningful redistribution is going to be on the agenda.\nWhen the coronavirus crisis finally abates, will any prime-ministerial hopeful ever again utter the phrase \u201cFuck business\u201d?\nThose were the words that Boris Johnson allegedly used in 2018 as a retort to the alarm among business leaders about how the Brexit process was unfolding. Johnson\u2019s government subsequently showed that it would not rush to the aid of companies in distress, letting the likes of Thomas Cook and Flybe go to the wall.\nNow, though, the business community is helping to keep the country on its feet through unprecedented turmoil. Of course there are exceptions \u2013 firms that have dragged their feet protecting staff, or banks proving slow to lend to those in need. But for the most part, UK plc has shown its best side.\nManufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce are deploying their collective power to churn out medical ventilators; they would have made greater progress by now if the government had not been slow to give the order. Fashion firms including Burberry are making protective gear for the NHS amid severe shortages. Restaurants such as Leon and Honest Burger are dishing out free meals to NHS staff. Chemicals firm Ineos may not be everyone\u2019s idea of a cuddly corporate, but it has built factories to manufacture hand sanitiser. The supermarkets are keeping the nation fed.\nOf course, business is simultaneously being helped by the government in ways always previously thought impossible \u2013 with tax holidays, grants, the picking-up of staff wages and myriad other offers. The fact that some initiatives are working too slowly is largely down to the speed with which they were developed.\nPoliticians, of course, must never shy away from taking on corporate interests. But when all of this is over, the government may want to reassess its side of the social contract with business.",

        "content": "Whole families are falling victim as African Americans are hit disproportionately hard by the coronavirus pandemic\nLast weekend, at two churches in New Orleans, two pastors read from separate passages of the Bible as they buried four members of the same family. Each had died within days of each other after contracting the novel coronavirus.\nAt St James Methodist church, a single-storey red-brick in the city\u2019s seventh ward, the Rev Joseph Tilly recited Luke chapter 15 as he mourned Timothy Franklin, 61, and his brothers Anthony, 58, and Herman, 71. \u201cThe three prodigal sons,\u201d he told the small, congregation of grieving relatives sitting at a distance from each other, \u201chave gone back to their heavenly father.\u201d\nTilly had taught \u201cthe boys\u201d since they were children at Sunday school. \u201cI prayed before the service and God gave me strength,\u201d he said.\nThe next day, at Ebenezer Baptist, pastor Jermaine Landrum read from Job, chapter 1 as he remembered the brothers\u2019 mother, 86-year-old Antoinette Franklin, a lifelong worshipper at the church who, just a few weeks earlier, had embraced Landrum and thanked him for another Sunday service.\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said the pastor, reflecting on the counsel he gave to Franklin\u2019s surviving nine children. \u201cCan you imagine losing a mother and three brothers in a matter of days? It\u2019s a tragedy for our community.\u201d\nAcross the city of New Orleans and throughout the state of Louisiana, in America\u2019s deep south, similar scenes of mourning have played out among hundreds of African American families. Louisiana is among the states hardest-hit by Covid-19, with 755 deaths marking one of the highest per-capita death rates in the country. Seventy per cent of those who have died here are black, despite African Americans making up only 32% of the state population.\nThis racially disproportionate rate of death has begun to emerge among other states in the deep south, America\u2019s poorest region, where a nexus of intergenerational poverty, a greater prevalence of underlying health conditions, and less access to healthcare are certain to have more pronounced consequences for the black community as the virus proliferates.\n\u201cThe south has the perfect storm of characteristics to just be a tragic region in terms of the Covid outbreak,\u201d said Thomas LaVeist, dean of public health and tropical medicine at Tulane University.\nLaVeist pointed to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease \u2013 mostly tied to poverty \u2013 among black residents of Louisiana and other former Jim Crow states including Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina that make up the deep south. All conditions are suspected of elevating risk of death from Covid-19.\n\u201cAfrican Americans not only have higher prevalence of these chronic conditions, but they also, on average, acquire these conditions at younger ages. So when we talk about people over the age of 65 being at increased risk, for African Americans, that age is probably 55, maybe even 50.\u201d\nAlthough the majority of deaths in Louisiana are still those over the age of 70, 31% are aged between 50 and 69, a proportion that is slightly higher than in New York City, the center of America\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe \u201cperfect storm\u201d LaVeist refers to, brews over a region that has almost unanimously \u2013 bar Louisiana \u2013 declined to expand Medicaid benefits offered by Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare legislation, the Affordable Care Act, which would enable millions of low-income southerners access to health insurance.\nIn Alabama, which has seen one of the highest rates of rural hospital closures in America, and where 75% of rural hospitals operate at a financial deficit \u2013 partially due to this Republican state\u2019s decision not to expand benefits \u2013 healthcare advocates warned the pandemic could lead to a number of hospitals closing at the height of an outbreak due to the financial pressures associated with treating uninsured people.\nBut, warned Michael Saag, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the lack of benefits expansion here could also stop people from seeking treatment for Covid-19 until it is too late.\n\u201cA lot of people who live in poverty wait with an illness until they absolutely have to be seen, so they come in with much more severe symptoms of whatever they\u2019re dealing with.\n\u201cIt means the people who pick it up are going to typically be late to present [for treatment] and more likely to be hospitalized and therefore potentially more likely to have advanced disease and maybe need intensive care units.\u201d\nAlabama has begun to see a surge in cases in recent days with 80 people now dying from the virus \u2013 36% of deaths were African Americans who make up only 26% of the state\u2019s population.\nAdding another layer to a deepening crisis in the south, is the inaction that characterized many state governors\u2019 response to the pandemic just weeks ago, with a number attempting to keep their economies open for as long as possible.\nIn Georgia, the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, a close ally of Donald Trump, waited until last Thursday to issue a stay-at-home order, far behind his Democratic counterparts in other jurisdictions.\nGeorgia has released only partial data on the racial breakdown of its Covid-19 deaths, which have surged to 425.\nThe story is the same in Mississippi, where the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, issued a stay-at-home order just a day before Kemp. Two weeks earlier, as he continued to resist calls to sign the order and as neighbouring Louisiana and its Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, declared a state or emergency \u2013 Reeves had written an op-ed in the local press, advocating the power of prayer to combat the virus and advising Mississippians not to panic.\nEighty-two people have died from Covid-19 in the state. The Mississippi department of health has declined to break the numbers down by race.\nOn the eve of the Easter weekend, with churches across this deeply Christian region mostly closed, the civil rights and moral revival campaigner the Rev William Barber preached a sermon online.\n\u201cTake a candle and light it in remembrance of those who have died and are dying unnecessarily,\u201d said Barber, who has focused much of his campaigning in poor communities throughout the south. \u201cDying because of human negligence. Not what God has done, but, instead, what we haven\u2019t done. Their deaths will not be in vain. Their suffering, not without a witness.\u201d\n Lauren Zanolli contributed reporting",

        "content": "Women tell of \u2018bereavement\u2019 because they will be too old for fertility treatment when the coronavirus shutdown ends \nCoronavirus \u2013 latest updates\nSee all our coronavirus coverage\nThousands of couples may have missed their last chance of conceiving via IVF as fertility clinics shut their doors to patients on Wednesday. Some women who are only just young enough to be eligible for treatment will be too old in a few months\u2019 time.\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates Britain\u2019s fertility industry, has ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients who are in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April. All new treatments have already been banned, a decision which is likely to prevent the births of at least 20,000 desperately wanted babies if it remains in place for 12 months.\nSome couples say they have had scans and treatments cancelled hours or even minutes before they were due to take place, and many fear their chance of conceiving will have disappeared completely by the time the lockdown ends.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t rewind your biological clock,\u201d said Dr Catherine Hill, of the reproductive research charity Progress Educational Trust. \u201cTime is of the essence when it comes to fertility treatment. For some people, this shutdown means they may never become parents. This was going to be their last chance and they\u2019re not able to have it. That is deeply distressing and traumatising.\u201d\nThe latest figures from the HFEA show that more than 54,000 patients underwent 75,000 fertility treatments in 2017, resulting in 20,500 births. \u201cIf these numbers are similar for 2020 \u2013 and we expect them to have increased \u2013 this pandemic is silently affecting the lives of many more people than is immediately obvious,\u201d said Gwenda Burns, chief executive of the charity Fertility Network UK.\nShe said women in their late 30s and early 40s were feeling particularly anxious, fearing that clinicians may decide they are too old to continue their IVF treatment when the shutdown ends. NHS clinical commissioning groups do not generally allow women a second round of IVF after they hit 40, and stop offering any treatment at 42; private clinics typically refuse to treat women aged 45 or over.\n\u201cIt would be beneficial if the government could give assurances that patients will not be disadvantaged as a result of treatment being paused due to Covid-19,\u201d said Burns.\nCalls to the charity\u2019s counselling helpline have increased by 50% over the past three weeks, with psychologists warning that the coronavirus shutdown is having a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the mental health of IVF patients and putting a big strain on the marriages of infertile couples.\n\u201cFor a lot of people, their hope of a family life has just been taken away,\u201d said Christina Fraser, a relationship counsellor at Coupleworks. The infertile couples she is counselling are experiencing the same emotions people typically suffer when they are bereaved, she said. \u201cFor a lot of couples it\u2019s a secret \u2013 they haven\u2019t told people. So they\u2019re grieving on their own. And they can\u2019t even go round the corner to their mum for a hug.\u201d\nHearing others complain about how irritating it is to be around their children all day or joke about how there is going to be a baby boom in nine months\u2019 time is often particularly painful for these couples, causing displaced resentment and triggering \u201cdreadful rows\u201d about insignificant grievances. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere for them to put all their anger and grief. And if people sit on those feelings and can\u2019t express them, that can really lead to depression,\u201d Fraser said.\nThe Observer has been contacted by more than a dozen couples who were expecting to start treatment just as the shutdown began. One woman, whose husband can no longer produce sperm after undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer, will turn 39 next month and was recently told her egg reserves have begun to decline. She fears that, by the time the shutdown ends, she will be unable to conceive. \u201cEssentially, the situation with Covid-19 is my worst nightmare becoming a reality,\u201d she said.\nRose (not her real name), 41, and her husband sold their home to pay for private IVF treatment after struggling to conceive for three years. She spent the first three weeks of March injecting herself with hormones every day, before being told, just 45 minutes before she was due to attend a scan, that her entire treatment was cancelled. \u201cI broke down. I\u2019m aware that every day, at my age, my eggs diminish,\u201d she said.\nShe has been having terrible mood swings ever since and getting into \u201chuge arguments over very small things\u201d with her husband. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had discussions where we\u2019ve told each other to go and find someone else, someone younger or more fertile.\u201d Although she is seeking counselling for her feelings of despair and depression, he doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely awful.\u201d\nWorst of all, she said, is the lack of recognition that infertile couples are suffering as a result of Covid-19. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even got anything to show for your grief, if that makes sense.

        "content": "While Jair Bolsonaro sabotaged quarantine efforts in Brazil, Jacinda Ardern was quietly impressive in New Zealand. Observer writers assess premiers\u2019 reactions to the pandemic\nBrazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is one of only a handful of world leaders who have played down Covid-19\u2019s threat, for instance by sabotaging quarantine measures imposed by nearly all of the country\u2019s state governors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s raining. We\u2019re going to get wet. And some are going to drown in the rain,\u201d the far-right populist shrugged last week, after dismissing the pandemic as a fantasy. That cavalier attitude has sparked nightly pot-banging protests and daily media condemnations. They accuse Bolsonaro \u2013 who apparently thinks shutting down the economy will wreck his chances of re-election \u2013 of putting his own political future before Brazilian lives.\n\u201cBolsonaro\u2019s reckless behaviour has earned him a position never previously enjoyed by a Brazilian president \u2013 that of international villain,\u201d one conservative broadsheet recently declared. Another paper, the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, said Brazil needed a Winston Churchill-like statesman to offer \u201cblood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d. Unfortunately, the newspaper lamented, it had nothing of the sort.Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro\nWhile many of her European neighbours were fumbling around for a response, Mette Frederiksen closed her country\u2019s borders on 13 March. A few days later she closed kindergartens, schools and universities and banned gatherings of more than 10 people.\nThis decisiveness appears to have spared Denmark the worst of the pandemic: its death toll stands at less than 250, and the number of patients being treated in hospital for coronavirus is falling. It has also marked out this skilled and successful politician, who was already the country\u2019s youngest-ever PM, as a once-in-a-generation national leader. A poll at the start of this month found that 79% of Danes thought she was doing a good job, a 40 percentage point rise on the month before.\nHer straight-talking speeches and clear instructions to the nation have been widely praised. She has even managed to show a sense of fun, posting a clip on Facebook of herself doing the dishes while singing along to 1980s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during the nation\u2019s weekly TV lockdown singalong.Richard Orange\nDonald Trump has benefited from a \u201crally round the flag effect\u201d which, in a crisis, tends to give US presidents a boost, irrespective of performance.\n  But although 50% of Americans say they approve of his handling of the pandemic, only 37% believe he has shown strong leadership or taken decisive action.\n  And Trump\u2019s approval rating lags some 22 points behind that of state governors and a similar margin behind many other world leaders \u2013 cause for concern in an election year.\n  Democrats accuse the president of squandering a crucial six weeks, when he played down the virus instead of preparing for it. Ron Klain, who led Barack Obama\u2019s fight against Ebola in 2014, said: \u201cThe US response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort.\u201d\n  But the president\u2019s allies take the opposite view, praising him for imposing early travel restrictions on China and Europe and overseeing a government effort that included sending hospital ships to New York and Los Angeles. America, as ever, is divided.David Smith in Washington\nChina\u2019s initial cover-up of the emergence of Covid-19, just when the new disease might have been easiest to contain, overshadows everything it has done since. However, its move to quarantine millions in Wuhan, the centre of the crisis, was bold, unprecedented and ultimately successful in halting the spread of the disease inside China, although at considerable human cost.\nThe outbreak was a huge threat to Xi\u2019s authority, because of the high economic costs and the inevitable questions about governance prompted by the crisis, and he initially stayed very much in the background of containment efforts. However, once it became clear they were working, Xi has re-emerged to take full credit for the turnaround.\nThe country\u2019s international propaganda machine is also working overtime to focus on Chinese support for countries in the middle of intense outbreaks, and muddy the waters over the origins of the virus, in a bid to counter rising anger abroad about China\u2019s initial handling of the outbreak.Emma Graham-Harrison\nPrime minister Jacinda Ardern is good in a crisis. The mosque attacks in Christchurch, the eruption of Whakaari White Island, and now the Covid-19 crisis, which has brought only four deaths in the country so far, have proved that beyond doubt.\nChoosing to \u201cgo hard and go early\u201d, Ardern placed the country in total lockdown on 25 March. The decisive move shocked many Kiwis, but Ardern softened the blow using clear, empathetic language and urging everyone to \u201cbe kind\u201d to one another \u2013 a slogan now emblazoned on billboards around the country. On the first night of the lockdown, she appeared in her tracksuit on Facebook live to reassure the nation.\nEpidemiologist Professor Michael Baker says New Zealand\u2019s \u201celimination\u201d strategy would not have been possible without Ardern at the helm. \u201cThe brilliant, decisive and humane leadership of Jacinda Ardern was instrumental in New Zealand\u2019s rapid change in direction with its response to Covid-19, and the remarkably efficient implementation of the elimination strategy.\u201d Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin\nTaiwan\u2019s close economic and cultural links with China should have made it extremely vulnerable to Covid-19, but it has one of the most impressive track records on containing the virus. Nearly three months after its first confirmed patient, Taiwan has recorded fewer than 400 cases, and just five deaths; its economy and schools have continued to function largely as normal.\nTsai\u2019s government, helped by the lessons learned during the Sars crisis in 2003 and having Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, as vice-president, took an extremely proactive approach. Screening of travellers from Wuhan began in late December, as soon as China warned of a mysterious new pneumonia.\nAt a diplomatic level, the crisis has also helped Taiwan highlight Beijing\u2019s heavy-handed approach to excluding it from international bodies, including the World Health Organization. The world health watchdog failed to share an early Taiwanese warning of human-to-human transmission of the new virus, which could have helped global efforts to contain the disease.Emma Graham-Harrison",

        "content": "Boris Johnson\u2019s hospital stay thrust the foreign secretary into the spotlight, but revealed a flaw in the UK\u2019s constitutional processes\nLast week exposed a gap in the UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements. The prime minister fell victim to the virus his government was battling. After a week of assurances that he was able to govern as normal from a sealed flat in Downing Street, Boris Johnson was admitted first to hospital, then to intensive care.\nBefore Johnson went to St Thomas\u2019 hospital, he had the foresight to pass the baton to the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, who would combine some prime ministerial responsibilities with those of his day job of foreign secretary. Raab\u2019s primary duty would be to chair meetings of the cabinet and cabinet committees. That, in fact, is much of what occupies prime ministerial time, especially when there are daily crisis meetings. Raab said that he was acting under clear instructions from the prime minister.\nWe were assured that there was no lacuna in our national security arrangements \u2013 Raab could, if necessary, declare war. Fortunately that capability was not tested last week. But he did not have the full range of prime ministerial powers. He could not hire and fire his colleagues \u2013 and would not be meeting the Queen for a weekly audience.\nFor a week, these arrangements have worked. The tramlines of the government\u2019s Covid-19 strategy were clear: ramping up testing, reinforcing NHS critical-care capacity, making sure that the cheques promised by the chancellor to support workers and business were delivered. Raab could front press conferences. Last weekend\u2019s papers were full of unedifying mudslinging and scapegoating: one immediate consequence of the PM\u2019s hospital admission seems to have been to make the cabinet realise it needed to show it could act collectively, without a PM to impose discipline.\nThe question is whether this ad hoc arrangement can work for longer than a week.\nRaab\u2019s authority was always going to be tested when important choices had to be made: how to start the exit from lockdown; how to balance maximum suppression with the wider health and social implications of stringent restriction; and the need to support economic bounce-back. Down the line, a decision will have to be made on whether to agree an extension to the Brexit transition before the end of June.\nSkilful chairmanship might be able to fashion a consensus. But sometimes prime ministers just have to decide. That is where Raab might have struggled. In his cabinet, Johnson is the unique big beast. Raab was knocked out early in the leadership contest. He was not the architect of the election victory; cabinet members do not owe him their jobs. Under Theresa May we saw how hard it was for a prime minister to get her way when she had no political authority.\nRaab\u2019s task will be much easier if, on the big calls, a convalescent prime minister can give his cabinet a steer. That will lend Raab valuable authority. If Johnson can\u2019t do that, Raab\u2019s task will be much harder.\nSo we, like the prime minister, may have got lucky. We may never find out whether our ad hoc arrangements are robust enough to withstand the long-term incapacitation of a prime minister during a crisis. Strengthening them should be a post-crisis priority.\nJill Rutter is senior research fellow at thinktank UK in a Changing Europe",

        "content": "Anglican vicars are not the only spiritual guides fighting curbs imposed on worship, with many flouting their government\u2019s rules as more people seek solace in religion\nMembers of the Church of England are not noted for their resistance to authority. But during Holy Week, the most significant time in the Christian calendar, its leaders have faced mounting objections to its edict that all churches must close - even to their own clergy.\nSome prominent Anglicans have taken to social media and blogs this Easter to argue that churches must remain open, and that to lock their doors is to risk people\u2019s spiritual health. Even Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London \u2013 a former nurse, and number three in the C of E\u2019s hierarchy \u2013 suggested in a letter to parishes that vicars could live-stream services from their church buildings\u2026 before correcting herself on Twitter.\nJustin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, was forced to restate the reasons for church closures in a Facebook video last week. In a tone of rebuke, he said the church must \u201cset an example\u201d.\nAll this was just a minor example of people of faith insisting on their right to worship in traditional ways in the face of near-global paralysis. Some of the most extreme have claimed they have divine protection, that the virus is God\u2019s punishment for the sins of the world, or that it is a sign of the end of days.\nPerhaps the first example of religious organisations elevating their right to worship above the right of others to health came in mid-February in the South Korean city of Daegu. More than 1,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus prayed shoulder to shoulder in a windowless basement. In the congregation was a 61-year-old woman with a sore throat and a fever.\nThree days later, she became Patient 31, the 31st person in South Korea to test positive for Covid-19. By 1 March, some 2,200 cases \u2013 then about three in five of South Korea\u2019s total \u2013 were traced back to the church.\nIn the following weeks, as wave after wave of countries announced restrictive measures, evidence grew of resistance among some religious groups and organisations. In Bangladesh, at least 10,000 \u2013 some estimate 30,000 \u2013 Muslims gathered for a mass prayer session in the town of Raipur on 18 March. A religious leader in the town told people that, following the prayers, they would now be \u201cfree from the coronavirus\u201d.\nA couple of weeks earlier, 16,000 people attended a four-day Islamic conference at the Sri Petaling mosque near the Maylasian capital, Kuala Lumpur. About 1,500 were from other countries, including China and South Korea. More than 400 coronavirus patients in Malaysia were later linked to the conference \u2013 and other cases in Brunei, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand were traced back to the mosque meeting.\nFriday prayers became a point of tension in Pakistan and Bangladesh, across the Middle East. The religious obligation for Muslim men to go to the mosque for noon prayers on Friday ran up against lockdown restrictions, despite the reassurance of imams and Islamic scholars that these were exceptional circumstances.\nIn Israel, the UK and the US, ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities celebrated Purim on 9 and 10 March. People gathered in large numbersbut within days, rabbis and communal leaders were advising synagogues and yeshivas (religious schools) to close.\nAfter the Israeli government\u2019s lockdown regulations were flouted, the entire city of Bnei Brak was barricaded, with 1,000 police officers blocking the movement of its ultra-Orthodox residents. And In New York, police broke up three ultra-Orthodox funerals last weekend.\nIn Stamford Hill, north London, home to a large ultra-Orthodox population, cars toured the streets, broadcasting the message about closures. A letter, signed by 20 Jewish doctors and circulated to the community, said: \u201cYou are fully responsible for deaths that occur as a result of ignoring this advice.\u201d Communal leaders in the UK have since raised concerns about what appears to be a disproportionately high number of deaths among Jews. According to the Board of Deputies, 152 Jews had died of Covid-19 by last Wednesday \u2013 2.77% of the total UK death toll at that time. Jews make up 0.4% of the country\u2019s population.\nIn the US, churches in Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Louisiana have continued to hold services, with some states offering limited exemptions from restrictions for faith organisations. Rodney Howard-Browne, a pastor in Tampa was arrested after his megachurch hosted acts of worship attended by hundreds of people.\nAmid these tensions, faith leaders in the UK say they have been taken aback by the numbers of people tuning into online worship and prayer \u2013 far more than turn up in person. Virtual services are \u201cmeeting a deep spiritual need\u201d, said Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Ripon. \u201cPeople are asking big questions about Covid-19 \u2013 why now, why us, what does this mean for my life?\u201d\nThis month, as the world\u2019s major religions celebrate significant festivals \u2013 Easter, Passover, Ramadan and Vaisakhi \u2013 in isolation, the test of faith is set to intensify.",

The worst affected countries were the US (529,951 cases, 20,608 deaths), Spain (163,027 and 16,606 ), Italy (152,271 and 19,468), France (130,730 and 13,832) and Germany (125,452 and 2,871).\nDonald Trump has said that reopening parts of the US for working life will be one of the toughest decisions he ever makes, and he\u2019ll be making it \u201creasonably soon\u201d. Speaking on Fox News, Trump said: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the toughest decision I ever made and hopefully the most difficult I will ever have to make. I hope I\u2019m going to make the right decision. I will be basing it on a lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders. There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that. And it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and instincts.\u201d\n\u201cEaster offers a message of hope in people\u2019s darkest hour,\u201d Pope Francis said at a late-night vigil Mass in an empty St Peters Basilica on Saturday. \u201cDo not be afraid, do not yield to fear: this is the message of hope,\u201d said the Pope. The Pope was preparing to break with centuries of tradition and livestream his Easter Sunday mass to allow the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Catholics celebrate their holiest holiday.\nA \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus patients has started to put a strain on hospitals in Moscow as Russia\u2019s death toll rose to more than 100. Moscow and many other regions have been in lockdown for nearly two weeks to stem the contagion, but hospitals in the capital are still being pushed to their limit, the Kremlin said. On Saturday, dozens of ambulances queued outside a hospital handling coronavirus cases. Russia has reported 13,584 cases, and authorities said on Saturday that 12 new deaths in the last day had pushed the toll to 106.\nElderly people may have to be kept isolated until the end of the year to protect them from the coronavirus, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. \u201cWithout a vaccine, we have to limit as much as possible contact with the elderly,\u201d she told the Germany daily Bild. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult and that isolation is a burden, but it is a question of life or death, we have to remain disciplined and patient.\u201d\nAs the coronavirus pandemic causes global economic devastation, China could take control of debt-struck nations\u2019 assets at an accelerated rate, or it could boost its soft diplomacy by forgiving debt. The choice has been laid out by the authors of a Harvard report on a Chinese tactic dubbed \u201cdebtbook diplomacy\u201d, and comes amid calls for G20 nations to endorse a year-long debt moratorium for the poorest countries.\nMainland China has reported 99 new cases on Saturday, of which all but two were imported. The country\u2019s national health commission said no one had died from the virus on Saturday. The two local cases were in Heilongjiang, China\u2019s northernmost province, which borders Russia. Of the 97 imported cases recorded, 43 were in the city of Shanghai. There were no new cases reported in Hubei, the province where the outbreak began.\nA world-first Hong Kong University study has found the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 reproduces three as fast as the virus behind Sars. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, the study on infected lung tissue donated by coronavirus patients discovered that Sars-CoV-2 could replicate about 100 times within 48 hours, compared to the Sars virus peaking at about 10-20. The new virus also induced slower immune and inflammatory responses, it said. \u201cThe virus is like a ninja, replicating inside the body with lower interferons and inflammatory response,\u201d said researcher Jasper Chan Fok-woo.\nThe partner of Julian Assange has pleaded for him to be released from prison on bail over fears he could contract Covid-19. Stella Moris, who also revealed the couple have two children, aged one and three, said Assange had been in poor health for months and there were now genuine fears that the coronavirus was spreading the London\u2019s Belmarsh prison where he is being held, awaiting an extradition hearing.

        "content": "Juliette Binoche is wondrous as a woman with a fantasy identity in an exploration of the perils and pleasures of life online\nThere\u2019s something peculiarly timely about this deliciously twisty, romantic thriller, with its themes of virtual isolation and physical separation. Freely adapted from a novel by Camille Laurens, Who You Think I Am boasts a kaleidoscopic performance by Juliette Binoche as a fiftysomething woman who has been rendered invisible by society (at one point a character literally looks at her without seeing her) but finds a new face for herself online. Pitched somewhere between the icy satire of late-period Claude Chabrol and the guilty thrills of Guillaume Canet\u2019s Tell No One, Safy Nebbou\u2019s mysterious tale of love and obsession will strike a chord with anyone who has worried about the random interactions of the internet while remaining inexorably drawn to the seductive glow of their iPhone.\nBinoche is Claire, a disillusioned divorcee who recounts her story to therapist Dr Catherine Bormans (Nicole Garcia) while we watch in flashback. Having been \u201cunfriended\u201d by younger lover Ludo, Claire creates a fake online persona \u2013 an alluring 24-year-old named Clara with whom Ludo\u2019s assistant Alex (a ruffle-haired Fran\u00e7ois Civil) promptly becomes infatuated. What starts as an attempt to spy on her ex soon blossoms into something more: a virtual relationship with Alex conducted with all the crackling energy of a long-distance affair. It\u2019s intense, erotic and overwhelming. But is Alex really the subject of Claire\u2019s affections? Or is it the thrill of becoming Clara that truly fires her passion?\nSlyly characterising social media as \u201cboth the shipwreck and the life raft\u201d, the film adroitly charts Claire\u2019s descent into a second life, increasingly removed from the rules and responsibilities of the physical world, addicted to \u201cthat little green light\u201d on her screen, like Gatsby mesmerised by the light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock. One moment she\u2019s chiding her kids for using their phones at the table, the next she\u2019s furtively hiding her own calls, walking through supermarkets and libraries in a bubble, oblivious to the outside world. \u201cWhen I was with him I felt alive,\u201d she tells Dr Bormans, apparently forgetting that she was never \u201cwith\u201d Alex at all. They even have sex, albeit at a distance, leaving her feeling \u201cmore like Clara than Claire\u201d. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Bormans asks. \u201cTo live another life?\u201d \u201cNot another one,\u201d snaps Claire, \u201cmine! At last!\u201d\nIt\u2019s significant that Claire is a professor of literature, well versed in the complexities of the authorial voice. We see her in lectures, discussing Les Liaisons Dangereuses; citing Marguerite Duras as a \u201ctruly independent\u201d spirit\u2019; unpacking the role of Nora in Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House. At one point she compares her online life to a novel, and throughout the drama we watch Claire effectively writing her own story \u2013 her past, present and future. But in this brave new world, the spectre of Unfriended is never far from view, adding a tinge of horror to the unfolding psychodrama.\nNebbou cites Kurosawa\u2019s Rashomon and Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo as key cinematic inspirations, although I was put more in mind of Karel Reisz\u2019s adaptation of The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman, with its knowingly playful deconstruction of narrative. Certainly Claire is an unreliable narrator, daring Dr Bormans to become involved in (and aroused by) her recollections, exhibiting a stalker\u2019s desperation for some form of validating response from a stranger. But there\u2019s also a strange sense of empowerment in Claire\u2019s ability to un-write and then re-write her life at will, as if the internet had provided her with the ultimate blank page \u2013 a canvas upon which dreams may be made real.\nWhile the film\u2019s mirrored visuals are as crisp and glossy as an uninterrupted high-speed broadband connection (something after which many of us lust in vain), the script by Nebbou and Julie Peyr is full of cracked humour, such as the moment when Claire is caught out using an old-fashioned colloquialism online, and has to Google \u201cinsta\u201d before continuing her conversation. Binoche, who spends much of the movie alone in the frame, gets the tragicomic tone of these scenes just right, perfectly embodying the Claire/Clara dichotomy as two worlds collide \u2013 youth and age, physicality and fantasy, sadness and psychopathy. Her performance really is a thing of wonder, reminding me somewhat of Kristin Scott Thomas\u2019s subtly unhinged turn in Catherine Corsini\u2019s Leaving.\nIbrahim Maalouf\u2019s score plays dextrously upon the film\u2019s competing themes, with strings highlighting the yearning melodrama, while an apparently innocent piano riff subtly echoes the tripping, two-note chime of Claire\u2019s Facebook alarm. It all adds up to a very modern drama about age-old anxieties: the fear of ageing and death; the desire for intimacy and reassurance; the allure of artifice and deceit.\nWho You Think I Am is available on Curzon Home Cinema",

        "content": "Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has meant Obama\u2019s absence is keenly felt \u2013 but an endorsement of his one-time running mate may be imminent\nMiss me now? Barack Obama\u2019s absence has probably never been felt so keenly by his millions of supporters.\nThey feel sure the former US president would have taken a very different approach, and struck a very different tone, from Donald Trump in handling the once-in-a-century crisis of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut while for now Obama is hunkered down at home with few tools beyond Twitter, a return to the political stage could be imminent. With his former vice-president, Joe Biden, this week in effect confirmed as the Democratic candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election, Obama\u2019s endorsement is eagerly awaited.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the majority of Americans are yearning for Barack Obama\u2019s leadership right now,\u201d said Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s palpable. You can feel that around the country. He led us through the financial crisis, Ebola and several other crises. For eight years he stood at the podium and said, \u2018I take responsibility.\u2019 Now we have the antithesis of that.\u201d\nObama inherited an epic trauma of his own, the 2008-09 financial meltdown, which, supporters claim, would have developed into a Great Depression but for the actions of his administration. He also had to deal with an outbreak of swine flu, which killed an estimated 12,469 Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nEbola in west Africa in 2014-16 raised further alarm but only 11 people were treated for the virus in the US. Obama\u2019s White House Ebola \u201cczar\u201d, Ron Klain, is now a regular TV and podcast critic of Trump\u2019s disorganized response to the coronavirus. On Wednesday, Klain tweeted a video of Obama in 2014 warning of the need to be ready for the next pandemic.\nObama\u2019s former national security adviser Susan Rice told the Washington Post that Trump\u2019s failures \u201ccost tens of thousands of American lives\u201d.\nThe ex-president himself, however, declines to speak out directly against his successor. But he has tweeted more frequently than usual: 33 posts in the past month, many of which offer advice on stopping the virus spread, pay tribute to healthcare and other essential workers or share inspiring stories.\nDemocrats watching the catastrophe unfold can only imagine what might have been. Vela, who sat on the White House emergency preparedness and continuity of government working group, said: \u201cI\u2019m sure President Obama is champing at the bit. He knows what should be happening. That\u2019s why you hear such frustration in the voices of those who worked for him.\u201d\nObama\u2019s admirers say he was often at his best in the face of tragedy. He spoke movingly and wept after the killing of 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Honoring nine African Americans shot dead at church in Charleston, South Carolina, the president burst into a rendition of Amazing Grace.\nTrump not been seen crying in public. His daily coronavirus taskforce briefings seldom dwell on the monumental loss of life and human tragedy at the heart of the pandemic. But he does constantly praise his administration\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a cheerleader,\u201d he said this week \u2013 and his own TV ratings.\nVela, a board director at TransparentBusiness, commented: \u201cThis is a man who hasn\u2019t expressed one iota of empathy or compassion to the people who have lost loved ones in this pandemic. He is obsessed with Obama, he blames everything on Obama, and it\u2019s obvious where it comes from: he can\u2019t even shine Barack Obama\u2019s shoes.\u201d\nThe two presidents have always been polar opposites. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, added: \u201cTrump\u2019s narcissism is overpowering: everything is about him. Obama was a very controlled person. He would have given you the facts and nothing more. He would have been perfect for this.\n\u201cRemember the school shooting in Connecticut. Obama did cry, as any human being would after children were killed, but he was still able to speak carefully and in complete sentences. Trump\u2019s briefings are one-third true, one-third misleading and one-third complete gibberish. Can you ever remember Obama speaking gibberish?\u201d\nTypically in national emergencies, presidents make contact with their predecessors. John F Kennedy briefed and consulted with Dwight Eisenhower during the Cuban missile crisis. All five living former presidents came together to raise funds for hurricane relief in 2017 . Trump, however, has made clear he has no intention of speaking to Obama about the virus because \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much\u201d.\nBut he has frequently sought to blame Obama for the leaving the country unprepared, even though it was Trump who disbanded the national security council\u2019s pandemic preparedness unit. And this week, when Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary, he speculated on when Obama will endorse Biden.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Obama hasn\u2019t supported Joe Biden a long time ago,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThere is something he feels is wrong. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got to come out at some point because he certainly doesn\u2019t want to see me for four more years. We\u2019re not \u2013 we think a little bit differently.\u201d\nFew would disagree with that assertion. Trump is not alone in wondering why Obama has not already endorsed Biden. But it is not the first time: in 2015, Obama reportedly decided Hillary Clinton should be his successor and helped steer Biden away from running.\nSabato said: \u201cIt\u2019s about time, whenever he does it. I know there were many people close to Joe Biden who were miffed but they didn\u2019t say anything because the last thing they wanted to do was to antagonize the Obamas.\u201d\nObama kept his powder dry during a grueling primary contest that involved 28 candidates and may make Biden wait a while longer.\nSabato added: \u201cIf Obama endorsed Biden now, it would disappear into the pandemic black hole. So why would he waste that card?\u201d\nThe endorsement would presumably come before the Democratic national convention in Milwaukee, which has been postponed from July to August because of the virus. If it does go ahead, Obama and his wife, Michelle, would have a crucial role to play in making Biden\u2019s case, especially to many younger voters who flocked to Sanders in the primary.\nDavid Litt, a former Obama speechwriter and author of the upcoming Democracy in One Book or Less, said: \u201cBarack Obama is a very good person to introduce Joe Biden to younger voters. There\u2019s an old Bill Clinton saying: sometimes you need someone else to brag on you. Obama is the perfect person to brag on Biden. He can speak to Biden\u2019s abilities as a politician and is more trusted than anyone in the country right now.\u201d",

        "content": "In the first fortnight of being told to stay at home, 10 women were killed by men they lived with. A survivor tells of how easy it is to be trapped by coercive control\nChilling figures that show a surge in domestic abuse are beginning to emerge as couples spend enforced time in their homes together during the Covid-19 lockdown. Ten women were killed by men* (five of the victims were within married couples) in the UK between 23 March, when government lockdown restrictions began, and 6 April. The National Domestic Abuse hotline, run by charity Refuge, reported a 25% increase in calls in the same period, and between 26 March and 1 April, Women\u2019s Aid experienced a 41% increase in users visiting its Live Chat site, compared to the previous week.\nI fear that these statistics will tragically worsen over the coming weeks, as more and more women suffer increased levels of abuse at the hands of their partners. I know, from personal experience, what it is like to live like this, and the prospect of doing so 24/7 is unimaginable, with potentially devastating consequences for thousands of women.\nWithin weeks of me saying my marriage vows and having a simple band of gold slipped on to my finger, my life became more complicated. Lovingly prepared home-cooked dinners were angrily rejected by my new husband because I hadn\u2019t predicted his preferred meal that day. I\u2019d dress for a night out and be told he didn\u2019t like my choice of outfit. Phone calls to old friends began to feel uncomfortable as he lurked nearby, monitoring my conversations.\nI naively accepted these foibles as the reality of married life: the human flaws surfacing after the veneer of dating falls away. In reality, what I was experiencing, I recognised many years later, was coercive control. Since December 2015, this emotional and mental manipulation of someone in an intimate relationship has been formally recognised in criminal law as a corrosive form of domestic abuse \u2013 and often, as it was for me, too, a precursor and adjunct to physical violence.\nGradually, he chipped away, artfully alienating my small circle of friends, manipulating me to his moulded vision of wifely submission, undermining all my independent decisions, actions or emotions. After a while, weary of the daily commute \u2013 and perhaps subliminally hoping that I might restore some of the magic in our relationship \u2013 I began to work for myself, from a desk in the spare room of our cottage.\nBut my new-found liberation from corporate life had the opposite effect on my domestic life. I became a prisoner in my own home, answerable not to a boss but to an increasingly demanding husband, fuelled by spiralling alcohol consumption that made him more volatile than ever. The slightest thing might trigger his rage, leaving me in a state of heightened alert in his presence.\nIt was no longer a jibe or the silent treatment that came when I made the mistake of occupying the bathroom if he wanted to shower, but an angry fist punched through the ceiling or a hand around my neck, pinning me to the cold tiled wall, my feet hovering inches from the floor.\nThe stench of alcohol on his breath that accompanied a slightly maniacal glint in his eyes meant I knew I was likely to wake the next morning with a tender, dark purple patch somewhere on my body. I took to wearing rollnecks and scarves, even on warmer days, and was using concealer in industrial quantities. My wrists were often red raw from his vice-like grip, and my eyes were pink and puffy from the constant crying. Sunglasses became an essential accessory. I lost count of the vases and pieces of crockery that met their end after violent contact with the wall or floor. I began to fear I might suffer the same fate.\nThe darkest days came when the violence wasn\u2019t \u201cmerely\u201d a shove, a slap or even semi-strangulation but brutal, demanding, agonising sex against my will, that left me gasping and streaming tears into a pillow that I wished would suffocate me. It was, of course, rape. Even between spouses, non-consensual sex is a traumatic assault: no less of a crime than a harrowing attack on a stranger.\nAfter 10 increasingly turbulent years, my living hell ended in a court injunction and a prolonged, acrimonious divorce. The wounds have healed but the scars will always remain. Today, I fear for the millions of vulnerable women and men around the world who will struggle to escape abusive partners.\n *Compared to just over three on average over the same period in each of the years from 2012 to 2019, according to the femicide census\nAnyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexuality or background. If you are worried that your partner, or that of a friend, family member or neighbour, is controlling and abusive, seek help. Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chief Council\u2019s lead for domestic abuse, said this week, \u201cNo one is expecting you to be locked in an abusive relationship. This is a priority for us, and if you call us, we will respond.\u201d\nThis is a system for victims of domestic abuse who are worried about putting themselves in further danger if they are overheard when calling 999 from a mobile phone. An operator will ask which emergency service is required, but if you can\u2019t speak out loud, then your call will automatically be transferred to the Silent Solution system. You will hear an automated police message, which lasts for 20 seconds, then press 55 on your keypad. The system will detect your location and identify an emergency, signalling the call to the relevant police force.\nThe National Domestic Abuse Helpline, 0808 2000 247.

It\u2019s too much conflicting information. Do we wear masks or not? Does that malaria drug work on Covid-19 patients? Unfortunately, the same holds true for the government\u2019s small business relief efforts.\nOver the past few weeks I\u2019ve been telling thousands of business owners that they can get relief from the federal government. I\u2019ve been telling them to go for a $2m low-cost, longterm economic injury disaster loan from the small business administration and even get a $10,000 grant just for applying. I\u2019ve been saying that they can also apply for paycheck protection money where banks will lend up to $10m and then the small business owner can apply for forgiveness based on the amounts spent on payroll and other operating costs over a two-month period.\nGo, I say, go! Go to the government and they will help you survive this pandemic. Get your money! But no, that\u2019s not happening.\nNow we learn those $2m economic injury development loans are being capped at $15,000. Is that true? And those $10,000 grants are just $1,000 per employee? Really? Can we or can\u2019t we get forgiven for the costs of independent contractors? What exactly is the documentation we need and why are some banks requesting more? Why didn\u2019t you tell me that some banks wouldn\u2019t lend this money to non-customers or would cap their loans? Most importantly, how come we\u2019re waiting so long for our money?\nThat\u2019s only a smattering of the questions I\u2019m getting from confused and desperate small business owners on Twitter.\nIf you\u2019re one of them \u2013 like me \u2013 there\u2019s little we all can do about this other than soldier on. You should still apply for the relief programs but you should do so with the expectation that you\u2019re going to have to wait for your money, and the money may be less than what was initially promised. In other words: wear that face mask because it probably does something to protect you. But it may not. But wear it.\nThe federal government will tell you that that tens of billions of dollars of loans have been processed already and that many companies are starting to see funding. This is true, and somewhat encouraging. They will also tell you that many of the questions that banks had have been resolved. They will say that they have fixed the technical issues on their lending platforms and are signing up new lenders to accept applications. Also good. They\u2019re also clarifying some rules, issuing more guidelines and hiring more people to answer questions. They\u2019re also working on getting another $250bn approved by Congress to fund small businesses. I like that too.\nBut do I believe all that they are saying? If you\u2019re running a small business, do you? I guess the answer is whether or not you believe that wearing a face mask will help stop the spread of coronavirus. That\u2019s what the government says, so it must be true, right? Until next week, when someone high up in Washington says something else.",

The compositions sound overstuffed to my ear, long symphonies test my patience and, inevitably, the music slips into the background, making me feel like I\u2019m living in a period drama.\nThe repetitive structures of contemporary composers like Philip Glass and Steve Reich make sense to a techno-head, but pure classical has remained frustratingly out of my grasp.\nThis year is the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth, andcelebrations \u2013 all now sadly on hold \u2013were planned around the world. As I I\u2019ve got plenty of free time during lockdown, I decide to give Ludwig another shot, starting with his Symphony No 5 in C minor, possibly the most famous piece of classical music ever written \u2013 but my eyes glaze over after the dramatic da-da-da-DAH intro.\nLuckily, the internet offers plenty of help. The online Khan Academy has a video series on this very symphony, with a wildly enthusiastic conductor telling how when this music debuted it sounded innovative, even daring. The bombast of Beethoven would have been as thrilling as a Marvel fight scene to 19th-century Vienna. But even imagining this I still can\u2019t find the piece \u201cmind-shattering\u201d.\nAnother lesson breaks it down musically, highlighting a moment where the strings drop away to leave a single, plaintive oboe, before erupting back into action. It reminds me of how electronic dance music uses the dynamics of gentle breakdowns and explosive drops for maximum drama. So Beethoven had killer drops, too?\nThe pandemic has sent the world\u2019s orchestras into hibernation. I find a touching virtual performance of Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy by the Rotterdam Philharmonic, each player contributing from self-isolation. Hearing those strings soar, apart but together, I feel a genuine tingle.\nI\u2019m ready for the real thing. There are many options for virtual Beethoven concerts, including performances from Oxford and Berlin. I choose the Philadelphia Orchestra, who filmed themselves performing to an empty auditorium when their 12 March show was cancelled.\nThe lessons have made a difference. I can identify instruments and follow melodies, so feel more engaged. But I still get distracted. Beethoven, the Khan Academy teacher said, needs your undivided attention. So I put everything else aside, stand up, and Beethoven\u2019s emotional volatility suddenly surges through me. I do it the way I first fell in love with techno \u2014 checking nobody\u2019s there to see, I dance.",

The JDC said there was already pressure on the budgets of poor countries even before the economic shock of Covid-19, which had led to falls in commodity prices, huge capital flight, an increase in future borrowing costs, and loss of income in other ways such as remittances.\nMany African, Latin American and some Middle Eastern countries commonly pay more than 10% interest on their borrowings while richer nations can pay 1% or less.\nSarah-Jayne Clifton, thedirector of the JDC, said: \u201cIn the face of a medical emergency the scale of Covid-19, it is indefensible that poor countries are having to spend more money on debt payments than on healthcare. Before this crisis hit, 64 poorer countries were already spending more on external debt payments than on their public health systems.\n\u201cWe need urgent action by the international community to cancel developing country 2020 debt payments. This is the fastest way to help provide the financing that is desperately needed to shore up public health systems in the face of this unprecedented global crisis.\u201d\nThe 10 countries with the biggest difference between the proportion of government revenue spent on healthcare and external debt payments were Angola, Sri Lanka, Gambia, Republic of Congo, Ghana, Zambia, Laos, Lebanon, Pakistan and Cameroon. All spent more than 20% of government revenue on external debt payments in 2019.\nFinance ministers will discuss debt relief at virtual meetings of the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\nThe most likely outcome is thought to be a suspension of debt payments to other governments this year for the 76 countries classified as low-income by the World Bank because they qualify for grants and soft loans under its International Development Association (IDA) facility.\nThere is, however, pressure from a 200-strong coalition of charities and campaign groups to include the IMF, the World Bank and private-sector creditors in any deal.\nIn 2020, the 76 IDA countries countries are due to spend at least $18.1bn (\u00a314.2bn) on debt payments to other governments, $12.4bn to multilateral institutions and $10.1bn to external private creditors.\nThe IMF and the World Bank issued a joint statement last month calling on bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments from IDA countries this year. Both organisations fear that the twin impact of a simultaneous health and economic emergencies will put impossible financial pressures on poor countries and precipitate a new debt crisis.",

        "content": "British motor racing ace who, although he never won the world championship, inspired devotion in followers of the sport\nHe was content to be known, he often said, as the man who never won the world championship: a way of distinguishing him from those of lesser gifts but better luck who had actually succeeded in winning motor racing\u2019s principal honour. But it was the manner in which Stirling Moss, who has died aged 90, effectively handed the trophy to one of his greatest rivals that established his name as a byword for sporting chivalry, as well as for speed and courage.\nIt was after the Portuguese Grand Prix on the street circuit at Oporto, the eighth round of the 1958 series, that Moss voluntarily appeared before the stewards to plead the case of Mike Hawthorn, threatened with disqualification from second place for apparently pushing his stalled Ferrari against the direction of the track after spinning on his final lap. Moss, who had won the race in his Vanwall, testified that his compatriot had, in fact, pushed the car on the pavement, and had thus not been on the circuit itself. Hawthorn was reinstated, along with his six championship points. Three months later, when the season ended in Casablanca, he won the title by the margin of a single point from Moss, who was never heard to express regret over his gesture.\nSuch sportsmanship had become part of his appeal, along with the devil-may-care charisma formerly associated with Battle of Britain fighter pilots. His public image was enhanced by his willingness to invite feature writers and TV cameras into his town house in Shepherd Market, the district of Mayfair in central London where he lived, even when married, in a kind of bachelor-pad splendour amid a panoply of hi-tech gadgets.\nThe aura continued to surround him long after an accident on the track truncated his career at the age of 32, when he was still in his prime. The sight of Moss, in his later decades, entering the paddock at a race meeting, accompanied by his third wife, the effervescent and indispensable Susie, never failed to draw shoals of fans, photographers and journalists keen to hear his opinion on the latest controversy.\nHe loved to fight against the odds, and the greatest of his Formula One victories, at the wheel of an obsolete, underpowered Lotus-Climax, came in 1961 at Monaco and the N\u00fcrburgring, two circuits that placed the highest demands on skill and nerve. Those wins could be set alongside the epic victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and the historic triumph in the 1957 British Grand Prix at Aintree, when he and Tony Brooks became the first British drivers to win a round of the world championship series in a British car, prefacing a long period of British domination.\nBefore his retirement as a professional driver in 1962 he had competed in 529 races, not counting rallies, hill climbs and record attempts. He won 212 of them, an extraordinary 40% success rate. Of the 66 world championship grands prix he entered between 1951 and 1961, he won 16, a ratio unfavourably distorted by early years spent in uncompetitive British cars and by a pronounced share of mechanical misfortune.\nHe was born to parents who had met at Brooklands, in Surrey, the great cathedral of prewar British motor racing. His father, Alfred, was a descendant of a family of Ashkenazi Jews known, until the end of the 19th century, as Moses. A successful dentist, Alfred Moss also possessed a passion for motor sport, and competed at Brooklands in the 1920s; while studying in the US, he entered the Indianapolis 500, finishing 16th. His wife, Aileen (nee Craufurd), was the great-great-niece of \u201cBlack Bob\u201d Craufurd, a hero of the Peninsular war in the early 19th century; an equestrian, she also entered races and rallies in her own three-wheeled Morgan.\nWhen their son was born they were living in Thames Ditton. Two years later, after the birth of a daughter, Pat, they moved to a large house in Bray, Berkshire, called Long White Cloud. Both children rode horses competitively from an early age (Pat was to become a champion horsewoman and rally driver). Stirling, educated at Clewer Manor prep school and Haileybury, Hertfordshire, neither enjoyed nor excelled at academic work. It was at Haileybury that he was subjected to antisemitic bullying for the first time.\nHe was nine when his father bought him an old Austin Seven, which he drove in the fields surrounding Long White Cloud. At 15 he obtained his first driving licence and, with \u00a350 from his equestrian winnings plus the proceeds from the sale of the Austin, bought his own Morgan. It was followed by an MG (in which he was discovered by Aileen Moss while attempting, aged 17, to surrender his virginity to one of his father\u2019s dental receptionists) and then, in the winter of 1947-48, by a prewar BMW 328. This was the car with which he entered his first competition, organised by the Harrow Car Club, winning his class.\nResistant to the lure of dentistry, he worked briefly as a trainee waiter at various London establishments. But motor racing was where his heart lay, and for his 18th birthday his father bought him a Cooper-JAP, powered by a 500cc motorcycle engine, with which to compete in the new Formula Three series. After a couple of good performances in hill climbs, he entered and won his first single-seater race on the Brough aerodrome circuit in east Yorkshire on 7 April 1948.\nRuled out of national service by bouts of illness, including nephritis, Moss was soon a regular winner against fierce competition and before long he was making occasional trips to races in Italy and France. In May 1950, when a race was held in support of the Monaco Grand Prix, he set the best practice time, won his heat and then won the final.\nAs his reputation grew, he was approached in 1951 by Enzo Ferrari, who offered him a car for a Formula Two race at Bari, as the prelude to a full contract for the following season. Moss and his father made the long journey down to Puglia, only to discover that the only Ferrari was reserved for another driver, the veteran Piero Taruffi. No explanation was offered and Moss\u2019s fury at such treatment led to a lasting rift and a special sense of satisfaction whenever he managed to beat the Italian team, particularly in a British car.\nA victory in the 1954 Sebring 12-hours, sharing the wheel of an OSCA sports car with the American driver Bill Lloyd, opened the season in which he made his international breakthrough. Deciding to take the plunge into Formula One, he and his manager, Ken Gregory, first offered his services to Mercedes-Benz, then on the brink of a return to grand prix racing. When the German team politely indicated that they thought he needed more experience, Gregory and his father negotiated the purchase of a Maserati 250F, the new model from Ferrari\u2019s local rivals.\nNo racing driver can have invested \u00a35,500 more wisely. Moss and the 250F bonded instantly, and he was soon winning the Aintree 200, his maiden Formula One victory. By the time he entered the car for the German Grand Prix, he was being supported by the official Maserati team, which had recognised his world-beating potential. At Monza that September he was leading the Italian Grand Prix and looking a certainty for his first win in a round of the world championship when an oil pipe broke with 10 laps to go.\nMercedes had taken note, however, and signed him up for 1955, as No 2 to the world champion, Juan Manuel Fangio. Although neither spoke the other\u2019s language, a warm respect grew between them. At Aintree, having won three of the season\u2019s first four races and assured himself of a third world title, Fangio took his turn to sit in the slipstream as Moss became the first Briton to win his home grand prix.\nIn 1955, too, Moss won the Mille Miglia, the gruelling time trial around 1,000 miles of Italian public roads, in a Mercedes 300SLR sports car. During two reconnaissance runs his co-driver, the journalist Denis Jenkinson, prepared a set of pace notes that were inscribed on a roll of paper, held on a spindle inside a small aluminium box. As they charged from Brescia to Rome and back, Jenkinson scrolled through the notes and shouted instructions to the driver. They completed the course in 10 hours and seven minutes, at an average speed of 97.95mph \u2013 a record that stands in perpetuity, since the race was abandoned after several spectators were killed two years later.\nWhen Mercedes bowed out of Formula One at the end of 1955, Moss returned to Maserati while Fangio went to Ferrari. Moss won at Monaco and Monza, finishing runner-up to Fangio in the championship for the second time in a row. However he had always hoped to win grands prix in a British car, and for 1957 he was happy to accept an invitation to drive a Vanwall, a Formula One car built by the industrialist Tony Vandervell at his factory in Acton, west London.\nAt Aintree, after a patchy start to the season, he fell out of the lead with a misfiring engine. Taking over the car of his team-mate Brooks, who was still suffering from the effects of a crash at Le Mans, he resumed in ninth place and eventually took the lead with 20 laps to go after the clutch of Jean Behra\u2019s Maserati disintegrated and a puncture delayed Hawthorn\u2019s Ferrari. More conclusive were the subsequent victories at Pescara and Monza, when the British car and its driver beat the Italian teams on their home ground.\nAfter Fangio\u2019s retirement in 1958, Moss became his undisputed heir. When Vanwall did not attend the first race of the year, in Buenos Aires, he was allowed to drive a little two-litre Cooper-Climax entered by his friend Rob Walker and, through a clever bluff involving pit stops, managed to beat the Ferraris. Back in the Vanwall, he won the Dutch, Portuguese and Moroccan grands prix, but was again condemned to second place in the final standings, this time behind Hawthorn.\nVandervell was so distressed by the death of Stuart Lewis-Evans, the team\u2019s third driver, in Morocco at the end of the season that he withdrew his cars during the winter, leaving Moss without a drive for 1959. The solution was to form an alliance with Walker, the heir to a whisky fortune, whose Cooper-Climax would be looked after by Moss\u2019s faithful mechanic, Alf Francis, a wartime refugee from Poland. The dark blue car suffered from unreliability until late summer, when Moss took it to victories in Portugal and Italy.\nMoss and Walker remained in partnership for 1960, but a fine victory in Monaco with a new Lotus-Climax was followed at Spa by a bad crash during a practice session, the car losing a wheel at around 140mph and hitting a bank with such force that the driver suffered two broken legs, three crushed vertebrae and a broken nose. To general astonishment he was back at the wheel inside two months, winning his comeback race in a Lotus sports car.\nIn 1961 his virtuosity overcame the limitations of Walker\u2019s ageing Lotus and its four-cylinder engine. Twice he outran the V6 Ferraris of Wolfgang von Trips, Phil Hill and Richie Ginther, first in a mad chase at Monaco and then, on a wet track, at the 14-mile N\u00fcrburgring. He was at the height of his powers and the only problem was to find cars good enough to match his brilliance.\nBefore the start of the 1962 season Enzo Ferrari offered to supply his latest car, to be run in Walker\u2019s colours. Old resentments were cast aside and Moss accepted this rare invitation. But an accident at Goodwood, at the wheel of a Lotus, meant that it was never put to the test.\nNo conclusive evidence has ever emerged to explain why, on that Easter Monday, his car went straight on at St Mary\u2019s, a fast righthander, and hit an earth bank. It took 40 minutes to cut his unconscious body out of the crumpled wreckage.\nThe outward signs of physical damage \u2013 severe facial wounds, a crushed left cheekbone, a displaced eye socket, a broken arm, a double fracture of the leg at knee and ankle, and many bad cuts \u2013 were less significant than the deep bruising to the right side of his brain, which put him in a coma for a month and left him paralysed in the left side for six months, with his survival a matter of national concern.\nAfter lengthy treatment, convalescence and corrective surgery, he started driving on the road again. And in May 1963, a year and a week after the accident, he returned to Goodwood, lapping in a Lotus sports car for half an hour on a damp track. When he returned to the pits, it was with bad news. The old reflexes, he believed, had been dulled, and without that sharpness he could only be an ex-racing driver. In the fullness of time, he came to regret the decision. Had he postponed it a further two or three years, he felt, his recovery would have been complete and, at 35, he might have had several seasons at the top ahead of him.\nInstead he occupied himself with his property company. There was also the well remunerated business of being Stirling Moss, constantly in demand for commercial and ceremonial events. He participated in races for historic cars, taking advantage of a special dispensation that allowed him, and him alone of all the world\u2019s racing drivers, to ignore modern safety regulations by competing in his old helmet and overalls and doing without seat-belts.\nHe celebrated his 81st birthday by racing at the Goodwood Revival; a few months earlier he had fallen 30ft down the lift shaft at his Mayfair home, breaking both his ankles. Towards the end of 2016, however, he fell ill during a trip to the far east. After several weeks in hospital in Singapore he was flown home to London and his withdrawal from public life was announced.\nAlways enthusiastic in his pursuit of what, refusing to abandon the vernacular of racing drivers of the 50s, he referred to as \u201ccrumpet\u201d, he was married three times. The first marriage, in 1957, was to Katie Molson, the heir to a Canadian brewing fortune; they separated three years later. In 1964 he married Elaine Barbarino, an American public relations executive, with whom he had a daughter, Allison, in 1967, and from whom he was divorced the following year. He married Susie Paine, the daughter of an old friend, in 1980; their son, Elliot, was born later that year.\nAppointed OBE in the 1959 new year\u2019s honours list, and named BBC sports personality of the year in 1961, he was knighted in 2000.\nHe is survived by Susie and his children.\n Stirling Craufurd Moss, racing driver, born 17 September 1929; died 12 April 2020",

        "content": "\u00a3325m wiped off value of health department\u2019s emergency stockpile including PPE\nUK government stockpiles containing protective equipment for healthcare workers in the event of a pandemic fell in value by almost 40% over the past six years, the Guardian has found.\nAnalysis of official financial data suggests \u00a3325m was wiped off the value of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) emergency stockpile, reducing it from \u00a3831m in 2013 under the Conservative-led coalition government to \u00a3506m by March last year.\nThe finding is likely to raise further questions for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who faced criticism over the weekend after urging healthcare workers not to \u201coveruse\u201d personal protective equipment (PPE).\nThe revelation raises questions about why the value depreciated so quickly and how the fall related to stock-levels.\nAccording to official figures at least 19 UK healthcare workers had died after contracting coronavirus. Frontline medical staff have complained of PPE shortages, which they say are putting lives at risk.\nLast week, it emerged that three nurses who had been wearing bin bags due to a lack of PPE had tested positive for coronavirus. It was also confirmed that a consultant at a hospital in east London died from the virus weeks after making a plea to the prime minister for more PPE for NHS staff.\nHospitals have turned to schools for donations of science goggles amid shortages of eye protection, while some NHS staff have made improvised masks out of snorkels and bought kit from hardware stores.\nThe widespread shortages of equipment, which Hancock has blamed on problems with the distribution system, has raised questions about the UK\u2019s levels of preparedness for a pandemic of this kind.\nAccounts suggest funding for \u201cstockpiled goods\u201d that are \u201cheld for use in national emergencies\u201d was increased between 2008 and 2011, when pandemic preparedness was identified as a national priority for the NHS. But since 2013 the value of the stockpile has fallen.\nThe findings are likely to renew questions about whether government stockpiles held sufficient quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) before the Covid-19 pandemic and whether emergency preparations were affected by almost a decade of cuts and reduced public investment.\nOn Sunday, it was revealed that one in three UK surgeons say they do not have access to enough masks, gowns and other clothing to keep them safe.\nContacted by the Guardian, DHSC declined to provide a breakdown of its emergency stockpile\u2019s contents, which will also include medicines such as antivirals and flu vaccines. However, NHS plans drawn up in 2017 state that \u201cthe bulk of\u201d the pandemic stockpiles available to the health service consisted of PPE, including FFP3 respirator masks, gloves and aprons.\nThe stockpiled goods have shelf lives and so require frequent replenishment. According to the DHSC\u2019s financial accounts, between 2011 and 2019 depletions of the emergency stockpile significantly outstripped the amount spent on adding new supplies to the reserves.\nA spokesman for DHSC said the value of the emergency stockpile \u201cdoes not relate to the volume of its contents\u201d, adding that \u201cthrough responsible procurement\u201d officials had been \u201csuccessful in maintaining its stock\u201d.\nThe department refused to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the volume of the stockpile in 2019 compared with 2011.\nThe spokesman said the UK was \u201cone of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemics\u201d and the government \u201ccontinues to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment and support they need\u201d.\nThe reduction in the stockpile\u2019s value occurred at a time the government considered that a pandemic represented the most serious emergency threat likely to face the UK. The government has in recent years been concerned about the rapid worldwide spread of a novel virus to which people have no immunity.\nSince 2007, a series of studies and exercises to prepare the UK for an event of this kind identified the availability of PPE for health and social care workers as a cornerstone to a national response, essential to reducing transmission of a new virus.\nDr Lindsey Davies, a former national director of pandemic influenza preparedness, told the Guardian that PPE shortages were modelled as far back as 2007, during a large cross-government pandemic simulation codenamed Exercise Winter Willow. \u201cIt was a live issue at the time,\u201d she said.\nDavies explained that following the 2007 exercise \u201cthere was an increased momentum after that to develop a business case for stockpiling, and a lot of discussion about the right amounts and how far it was right to have a nationally funded stockpile\u201d.\nIn the wake of the Winter Willow exercise, and with the emergence of the swine flu pandemic two years later, the Department of Health, as it was then known, embarked on a procurement programme aimed at boosting stockpiles of medicines and PPE, according to departmental accounts and performance reports. By the end of the 2010-11 financial year, the value of the department\u2019s stockpile stood at \u00a3830m, an 80% increase from 2008-09.\nIn 2016, after years of delays, the government staged another nationwide pandemic drill, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. The exercise, which simulated a deadly outbreak of so-called \u201cswan flu\u201d, is believed to have shown that in the event of a deadly pandemic the NHS would be overwhelmed by a shortage of critical care beds and vital equipment.\nThe government is refusing to release the official conclusions from Exercise Cygnus, which have never been made public, but there are indications in reports by local authorities who participated in the exercise that PPE supplies were an area of concern.\nIt is not clear whether at a national level the conclusions included recommendations about emergency stockpile funding. But DHSC accounts show that in the three years after the 2016 drill, the value of the stockpile fell by more than \u00a3200m.\nSir Ian Boyd, the chief scientific adviser to Defra between 2012 and 2019 , told the Guardian it was difficult to get ministers to spend money on preparing for high-impact, low-frequency events like pandemics. \u201cGovernments over the years have buried their heads, and it is harder to have those conversations with people who have a small-government view of the world,\u201d he said.\nThis year, as the government began to consider the threat posed by the novel coronavirus outbreak in China to the UK, PPE soon found its way on to the agenda of meetings between officials and high-level scientific and clinical advisers.\nMinutes of meetings suggest that as early as January the government was involved in discussions with advisers about when emergency PPE stockpiles would need to be released.\nDuring a meeting on 28 January of the government\u2019s new and emerging respiratory virus threats group (Nervtag), attended by senior officials including England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, it was noted that if sustained community transmission of the novel virus in the UK was established, the numbers of infected patients in hospitals would rise. \u201cThis would entail deployment and use of the UK\u2019s pandemic influenza PPE stockpiles,\u201d a minute of the meeting states.\nAccording to minutes from early February, Nervtag went on to make a series of recommendations to the government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra about what PPE would be required for different settings and different groups of workers. A month later, in early March, advisers discussed a potential scenario where stocks of respirator masks ran out.\nAdditional reporting by Rob Evans",

Masoe was told a fortnight ago that because of the increased demand for beds for coronavirus patients at Wakefield\u2019s Pinderfields hospital he would have to continue his rehabilitation at home, despite the player insisting that he was not ready to leave hospital.\nThe 30-year-old has been in the spinal unit since suffering the injury in a game against Wakefield in January, but will now be able to stay in hospital after the benevolent fund, a charity that provides assistance to rugby league players and their families after life-changing injuries, intervened.\n\u201cWe were part of a group who insisted it was wrong to send him home,\u201d Steve Ball, the fund\u2019s general manager, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that people like him continue to get physiotherapy so his rehab stays well and truly on track. That would be impossible at home with the current social-distancing guidelines. He\u2019s made incredible progress and thankfully the spinal unit has been able to continue as normal.\u201d\nBall added that Masoe will receive support from the benevolent fund as long as he stays in this country. \u201cWe pay for everything we can, and we have made him a lifelong commitment that while he is here, he will get our backing and our help,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have guys who were injured in the 1970s and we support them the same. We\u2019re not a wealthy sport but we\u2019re rich in our values.\u201d\nThe hope is that Masoe can now stay in hospital for the entirety of his rehabilitation. \u201cWe are hoping so, though obviously Pinderfields have stressed it is always under review,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people like Mose that we ensure he gets the capacity and treatment he needs.\u201d\nMasoe has made remarkable progress since his injury. Initially paralysed from the shoulders down and able to move only his head, he is now walking with crutches. \u201cWe normally are notified of serious incidents fairly quickly and within a day of Mose\u2019s injury, I was by his bedside and holding his hand,\u201d Ball added. \u201cHe was laid prone in bed and I told him we would do everything we could to help, because he was genuinely fearful for his family.\n\u201cHull KR have agreed to honour his contract but we will sort everything else. When it looked like he was leaving hospital we paid for a stairlift to be put in at his home. His wife is self-isolating because she\u2019s six months pregnant, so we\u2019ve got Mose an iPad to speak to her and his family back in Australia. These sorts of commitments define who we are as a fund, and who we are as a sport.\u201d",

A further payment scheme is yet to be implemented.\nValentina Osuna, a craftswoman and mother of four from the indigenous Qom village of Rosarino, said she was no longer able to sell her work.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no support, there\u2019s nothing from the state. My children are hungry.\u201d\nAbdo Ben\u00edtez has apologised for the situation and called for patience.

Amid widespread outrage, the government has promised a reform of a state that is underfunded and plagued by corruption and highly skewed tax policies.\nHowever, for Alicia Amarilla, national coordinator of the Organisation of Rural and Indigenous Women, not even promises of reform can guarantee greater dignity for Paraguay\u2019s many poor families.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see many more difficult situations come from this crisis \u2013 we\u2019re in a country with far too much inequality.

        "content": "Reduction of 5% would represent biggest drop in demand for industry on record\nGlobal carbon emissions from the fossil fuel industry could fall by a record 2.5bn tonnes this year, a reduction of 5%, as the coronavirus pandemic triggers the biggest drop in demand for fossil fuels on record.\nThe unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and industry due to the coronavirus is expected to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system in 2020 alone, according to data commissioned by the Guardian.\nThis would lead to the fossil fuel industry\u2019s biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined.\nClimate experts expected global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production to rise in 2020, from an estimated 36.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. Instead, emissions may fall by about 5%, or 2.5bn tonnes of CO2, to its lowest levels in about a decade.\nDr Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.\n\u201cThis decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.\u201d\nThe fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and the abrupt halt of flights and driving could cause the world\u2019s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008.\nThe analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad.\nThe analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively.\nErik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world\u2019s total carbon emissions.\n\u201cThe last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.\u201d\nThe unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year.\nFewer cars on the road will also dent demand for petrol and diesel by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day.\nThe analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year.\nEnergy demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year.\nResio said: \u201cThe real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person. This could alter whether demand for oil ever recovers to the levels we have seen in previous years.\u201d\nHowever, Birol said if governments didn\u2019t take the right measures to include support for clean energy in new economic stimulus packages \u201cthen this decline could be easily wiped out in the rebound of the economy\u201d, once Covid-19 is brought under control.\nHe said: \u201cThese figures are important and impressive. But they don\u2019t make me happy. For me it\u2019s more important about what happens next year, and the year after that.\u201d",

The state is one of the centers of the pandemic in the US, and Covid-19 has had a particularly devastating effect on the black community. \u201cSlightly more than 70% of [coronavirus] deaths in Louisiana are African Americans,\u201d the state\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards, said last week. \u201cThat deserves more attention and we\u2019re going to have to dig into that to see what we can do to slow that down.\u201d\nThose figures are particularly stark given that approximately 32% of Louisiana\u2019s population is black. The numbers are similar in Chicago, where 30% of the population is black but 70% of those who have died of Covid-19 have been black. Latino communities have also been disproportionately affected by the virus, while white and Asian communities have generally been underrepresented in death rates.\nVarious theories have been presented as to why black and Hispanic people have suffered higher death rates during the pandemic in the US. They include the fact that black and Latinx people are less likely to be able to work from home, have less access to health insurance and good healthcare and are more likely to have underlying health issues.",

        "content": "Print papers have been defying predictions of doom for two decades. But this pandemic is likely to finish off many titles\nIt is the bleakest of ironies: the biggest news story in a lifetime is killing off the very industry that exists to report it. Coronavirus is destroying newsprint newspapers across Britain, delivering the coup de grace to businesses that were already in the process of dying.\nLocal and regional newspaper publishers have found it economically unsustainable to go on producing papers. In response, they have suspended the publication of scores of titles and placed hundreds of journalists on paid leave. \u201cFurloughs\u201d have become part of the new pandemic lexicon.\nAt national level, print runs have been drastically reduced because of distribution problems, most obviously resulting from the widespread closure of retail stores. Edition sizes have also been cut back due to the drop-off in advertisers. Similarly, many magazines are also forsaking print in favour of digital-only publication.\nAlthough formal announcements by publishers stress that their dramatic Covid-19 measures will be temporary, there is reason to believe some may be permanent. Newsprint, the transmission of news by ink on paper, might not recover from the contagion in what could eventually be seen as a transformational moment for the 380-year British newspaper history.\nThere will not be a post-pandemic \u201cold media\u201d recovery because it seems inconceivable that publishers, already struggling to fund journalism, will return to the previous status quo. That\u2019s because the status quo was, itself, one of perpetual fragility in which publishers were engaged in the delicate task of managing newsprint decline while, in parallel, seeking to create a digital journalism business model.\nAs is well known, their central problem has been the failure to find any viable alternative to advertising as newspapers\u2019 major source of revenue. Throughout the past 20 years, papers have defied forecasters who predicted that advertising income was on the verge of disappearing. Instead, it has lasted well enough to sustain newspapers, even though its decrease has necessitated severe cuts to editorial budgets and a consequent diminution in the quality and quantity of content.\nAdvertising\u2019s surprising durability has been important because it enabled publishers to play circus performers \u2013 riding two horses at the same time to provide funds for both newsprint and digital platforms. But sensible newspaper owners, managers and editors have long realised that there would come a time when advertising would dry up, newsprint\u2019s ever-decreasing audience would vanish, and they would need to find a way to fund digital journalism without ad support.\nThat there is a hunger for online news is undeniable. For the past month, every major publisher has been reporting record numbers of website visits. Page views each day have been off the chart. Dwell time, one of the key metrics to show the depth of reader engagement with individual articles, has increased, too. One result, according to some national publishers that impose charges for online access, has been a rise in subscriptions.\nTo put this in an even more positive perspective for newspapers, the expansion of interest in their content has occurred despite record viewing figures for TV and radio news and current affairs broadcasts. This interest is obviously due to coronavirus being, as everyone emphasises on a daily basis, an unprecedented event.\nWhat is not emphasised, however, is the certainty that its aftermath will also be unprecedented. Economic activity will surely be slower to revive than optimists, such as government ministers, would like us to believe. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t in a healthy state prior to the shock of Covid-19.\nBy the time the lockdown ends \u2013 and that light appears to be a long way down the tunnel \u2013 many companies may not be in a state to recover. It is true that some could seek to revive their businesses through advertising; but financial constraints on potential consumers, because of depleted income during the emergency, will make the outcome of such initiatives uncertain.\nPost-lockdown, publishers will be reassessing the state of their businesses. Aside from the difficulties they face in winning back advertisers, they will need to make rational decisions about their bottom lines. Did the closure of this or that title really matter? How much money did we save by publishing fewer newsprint issues? Do we need expensive offices when our papers have been so effectively produced by journalists operating remotely?\nIn mid-March, that wise historian, Peter Hennessy, conveyed the epoch-making significance of the pandemic during a BBC Radio 4 interview. Future historians, he said, will divide our age into BC and AC: \u201cBefore corona and after corona.\u201d\nI am convinced media analysts will make the same division. AC will likely mark the final stage in newsprint\u2019s long decline.",

A Chelsea statement confirmed he had died after a long-term illness, while the club captain, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, tweeted: \u201cRest in peace a true legend of our club. Sending love to Peter\u2019s family.\u201d\nAcross two spells with Chelsea, punctuated by a short stint in the US with the St Louis Stars, Bonetti worked his way to 729 appearances, keeping 208 clean sheets, a tally surpassed only by Petr Cech in 2014. Only the defender Ron Harris, with 795, has made more appearances for the club.\nBonetti, whom the England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland described as a \u201ctrue gentleman of the game\u201d having been trained by the former international with the national team, helped Chelsea win promotion from the Second Division in 1963 and 1977. He also played in the sides that won the League Cup in 1965, the FA Cup in 1970 and the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1971, the last with victory against Real Madrid in the final.\nThe Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, said he was very saddened to hear that the \u201chugely popular\u201d Bonetti had died. Chelsea\u2019s assistant manager Jody Morris also paid his respects to \u201ca Chelsea legend and also the goalie coach when I first got into England Under-21s in 1996\u201d.\nBonetti earned seven caps for England, conceding one goal in his first six, with much of his international career spent as back-up to Gordon Banks.\nBonetti was a member of Alf Ramsey\u2019s 1966 World Cup winning squad but did not feature for the hosts, instead waiting until 1970 to make a World Cup appearance, deputising when Banks fell ill just before the quarter-final with West Germany. With not much more than an hour to prepare, Bonetti was at fault for Germany\u2019s first two goals as England threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2. He never played for England again.\nIt took 43 years for the goalkeeper to receive his 1966 winners\u2019 medal after an FA campaign to recognise the non-playing squad members of the historic side.\nDespite Bonetti\u2019s difficult time on the international stage, Chelsea\u2019s statement noted Pel\u00e9 once saying: \u201cThe three greatest goalkeepers I have ever seen are Gordon Banks, Lev Yashin and Peter Bonetti.\u201d\nHaving stuck with Chelsea well into his 30s, Bonetti saw out his career with Dundee United and then Woking, before retiring to run a guesthouse on the Isle of Mull and work as a postman. He eventually returned to football as a specialist goalkeeping coach with Chelsea, then Newcastle, Fulham, Manchester City and England.\nThe former Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall said: \u201cPeter Bonetti was that nice when he coached us we had sessions where we tried to get him to lose his temper. After two hours he got mildly annoyed. Coolest guy ever.\u201d",

        "content": "It was Peter Bonetti\u2019s misfortune that despite his goalkeeping agility \u2013 his nickname \u201cthe Cat\u201d was well deserved \u2013 and despite the many matches he played (more than 700 for Chelsea), he is remembered above all for a disastrous hot day in Mexico in the World Cup of 1970, a match in which Bonetti, who has died aged 78, should not even have been playing.\nIt was the quarter-final of the World Cup against West Germany, whom England had beaten four years earlier at Wembley in the final. The first-choice England goalkeeper was the unrivalled Gordon Banks but on the morning of the match in L\u00e9on, scheduled absurdly for the intense heat of noon and at a breathless altitude, Banks was to be seen outside the England team hotel, pallid of countenance, walking slowly across the lawn as he was supported by the anxious England doctor, Neil Phillips. He was suffering from food poisoning.\nSo it was that Bonetti played instead of Banks, though hardly in the ideal condition to do so, as he had not had a game for some time. When England squandered a 2-0 lead to lose to West Germany 3-2, Bonetti was largely made the villain of the piece.\nHe was seriously at fault for the first German goal, when he allowed Franz Beckenbauer\u2019s low, unexceptional shot to run under his body. The second German goal, however, scored by the stocky centre-forward Uwe Seeler, was something of a freak. When Karl-Heinz Schnellinger lobbed the ball into the English goalmouth, Bonetti, off his line, was arguably out of position, but the back header with which Seeler scored was bizarre. And besides, it could be argued that a flagging England defence failed to move up in time to put Seeler offside.\nAs for the third and decisive German goal, it had as much to do with the defenders\u2019 weariness as with Bonetti\u2019s positioning. Terry Cooper, the England left-back, who should surely have been substituted, was too tired to prevent West Germany\u2019s inspired substitution, the outside-right J\u00fcrgen Grabowski, from crossing. Bonetti did not get to the high ball, Hannes L\u00f6hr headed it back, and the prolific Gerd M\u00fcller volleyed fiercely home.\nIt would prove to be Bonetti\u2019s seventh and last game for England. But his international record, until it came to L\u00e9on, had been excellent. The first match came in July 1966, a 2-0 victory against Denmark in Copenhagen, and before the L\u00e9on match he had conceded only one goal in his previous six.\nStanding 5 ft 10 \u00bdin tall and weighing 11 stone, he was something of a contrast with the giant goalkeepers to whom we have become accustomed, but he was brave and spectacular and, pre-L\u00e9on, had shown no signs of nervousness. He had also been a member of the victorious 1966 England World Cup squad, although Banks had played all the matches in that tournament.\nBorn in Putney, south-west London, to Swiss parents, Bonetti moved with his family, as a child, to the Sussex coast, where his parents opened a cafe in Worthing. His talents as a goalkeeper were soon apparent in local schoolboy football and he was enlisted by Reading for its youth teams. Then, after his mother had written to Chelsea asking them to give her son a trial, he was signed at Stamford Bridge.\nIn the 1960-61 season, at the age of 19, he became the first-team goalkeeper. Chelsea were relegated to the Second Division but, under the managership of Tommy Docherty, they at once returned to the First. Bonetti\u2019s later relations with Docherty became difficult \u2013 I remember an untypical outburst from him one day, after training, in a cafe near Stamford Bridge.\nInitially, however, a young Chelsea team flourished under Docherty and in 1965 Bonetti played a significant part in helping them win the League Cup final, then a two-legged affair, against Leicester City. That achievement was outshone when his inspired goalkeeping enabled Chelsea, after a replay in the final against Leeds in 1970, at last to gain the FA Cup which had eluded them since their foundation in 1905.\nBonetti was just as good when, in Athens in May 1971, Chelsea beat the formidable Real Madrid to take the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. His last game in goal for Chelsea was against Arsenal in May 1979 \u2013 his 729th for the club, during which he had kept clean sheets in 200 matches, conceding one goal or fewer in more than two-thirds of his appearances. In 1975 he briefly left Chelsea on a free transfer for a spell in the US with the St Louis Stars, but returned the following year.\nHe played five games for Dundee United in 1979, and on retirement he lived on the Isle of Mull, where he worked as a postman.\nHe then became a goalkeeping coach with Manchester City, Chelsea and the England team, and in 1986, at the age of 45, appeared for non-league Woking as they beat Weymouth 1-0 in the FA Cup.\nLatterly he worked on match days at Chelsea in the hospitality section.\nWith his second wife, Kay (nee McDowell), whom he married in 1992, he had a son, Scott, and he had four children, Suzanne, Kim, Nicholas and Lisa, from his first marriage, to Frances Jennings, which ended in divorce.\n Peter Phillip Bonetti, footballer, born 27 September 1941; died 12 April 2020",

With a shimmy he turns past Danny Rose and finds Jadon Sancho in the box. The winger, wearing England\u2019s red away shirt, finds room behind Harry Maguire and stands up a cross to the back post where Marcus Rashford is waiting to crash a header into the net. \u201cYes! Sancho to Rashford!\u201d screams Rashford at Sancho. \u201cI know your hands must be sweating right now!\u201d\nRashford, it turns out, has spoken too soon. Before half-time, Raheem Sterling has played in Rashford for a cool side-footed finish past Jordan Pickford: 1-1. Into the second half and it\u2019s Rashford\u2019s turn to repay the compliment, playing a cute one-two with Sterling inside the England box to score the winning goal. Final score: 2-1 to England. \u201cI swear down I\u2019m going to go back to the drawing board,\u201d Rashford says to Sancho. \u201cI\u2019m going to play you again.\u201d\nThe above events may sound like a fever dream but they did actually take place. On Friday night, Rashford and Sancho, the real-life versions, took control of their own avatars in a game of Fifa. Streamed live as part of the Football Association\u2019s #FootballisStayingatHome Cup, Sancho progressed to the round of 16 in an all-England video game challenge that continues throughout this week.\n#Footballistayingathome is just one of a growing number of online tournaments taking place during the coronavirus crisis. This week EA Sports, maker of Fifa, will launch the Stay and Play Cup, in which players from 20 of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs will compete to win a $1m donation to a charity of their choice.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold will be Liverpool\u2019s ambassador. Other competitions include one sponsored by La Liga and a Milan derby played on the Fifa rival Pro Evolution Soccer. There\u2019s also Rio Ferdinand taking on Mason Mount in a one-off.\nThe abundance of celebrity Fifa matches is proof that, just like the rest of us, footballers are looking for ways to entertain themselves during lockdown. It\u2019s a chance to raise funds for good causes, too. But it\u2019s also something of an experiment: one that could show whether video games can fill the void where live football used to be and also whether football \u2013 the kind played on grass \u2013 can engage with a generation of people who prefer their games virtual.\n\u201cYou can look at these Fifa tournaments as football coming to esports and trying to recapture the young demographic,\u201d says Adam Fitch. As editor of Esports Insider, Fitch covers the booming competitive video games industry, which now generates a billion dollars in revenue each year and whose biggest events, such as the League of Legends grand final, can attract audiences in the tens of millions.\nWhen it comes to competitive gaming, Fifa is something of an also-ran. \u201cIn esports we have rankings where we tier games,\u201d he says. \u201cFifa is in the third tier. There were 170,000 who watched the first La Liga tournament [which Marco Asensio won for Real Madrid] and for Fifa that\u2019s good. But the League of Legends European Championship pulls in more than that each week.\u201d\nFifa lacks certain dynamics that make for a great esport, not least the fact the game reboots each year. Fitch speculates that it is mostly football fans who will be watching these celebrity match-ups, as for any esports enthusiast the quality of play would be too low.\nAs of Sunday, the YouTube video of the Sancho v Rashford match had reached 100,000 views. For a football fan the interest was in seeing how the players reacted to the game as much as how they played it. Alongside the game footage and the chatter of a pair of commentators were windows into the competitors\u2019 living rooms. Sancho was sat on a chair designed for gaming, Rashford bent forward on his sofa.\nAs the game went on you could hear Rashford get more and more peeved with himself. \u201cDon\u2019t mess about with the ball,\u201d he shouted at Harry Kane at one point. \u201cI just find it fascinating listening to the players,\u201d one commentator said, as he talked over them.\nNot game enough for the gamers and not football enough for the fans, Fifa may be having its moment as a spectator sport but the jury is out on whether it is truly ready for primetime. \u201cI don\u2019t see it lasting,\u201d says Fitch. \u201cTwenty per cent may stay, the rest will go back to football.\u201d\nOne audience lapping up virtual football right now is, he points out, the bookies. Gambling sites are suddenly serving up odds on any number of Fifa contests, often in obscure eastern European esports leagues. \u201cIt\u2019s the only type of thing you can bet on,\u201d says Fitch. \u201cApart from Russian table tennis.\u201d",

And he had witnessed the \u201cpersonal courage not just of the doctors and nurses but of everyone: the cleaners, the cooks, the healthcare workers of every description, physios, radiographers, pharmacists\u201d.\nHe praised a list of nurses and doctors who had looked after him by name, and gave extra thanks to Jenny and Luis, saying their care and interventions were \u201cthe reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen\u201d.\n\u201cThat is how I also know that across this country, 24 hours a day, for every second of every hour, there are hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat is why we will defeat this coronavirus and defeat it together. We will win because our NHS is the beating heart of this country. It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love.\u201d\nHe also praised and thanked the public for observing social distancing when \u201cthe whole natural world seems at its loveliest and the outdoors is so inviting\u201d.\nHowever, he made no mention of the criticism that has dogged the government in recent weeks over its failure to get personal protective equipment to all NHS and care staff who need it, the problems with increasing testing and the UK\u2019s daily mortality rate having exceeded the deadliest days in Italy and Spain.\nNo 10 said the prime minister will head to Chequers to continue his recovery, leaving Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, deputising for him.\nA No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery at Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work. He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas\u2019 for the brilliant care he has received. All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.\u201d\nRaab has already announced the UK\u2019s lockdown will continue beyond the initial three-week period set out by Johnson and may have to take further decisions in the coming days about how much longer it should stay in place.\nJohnson was taken into hospital last Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a high temperature, persisted.\nHe was moved into intensive care on Monday evening. The government said he was not put on a ventilator but had continued to receive \u201cstandard oxygen treatment\u201d.\nOn Thursday, he was moved back to a hospital ward after three nights in intensive care, and was said to be in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d, according to Downing Street.\nFollowing his admission, colleagues expressed concern Johnson had still been receiving his red box of government papers at his hospital bed and urged him to rest.\nNo 10 has insisted it has been transparent throughout Johnson\u2019s illness but several reports have confirmed that the prime minister was more ill than officials were letting on in the days before his admission to hospital.\nJohnson is expected to take some time to recuperate, rather than returning swiftly to Downing Street, but is likely to want to be involved in the decision about when and how to end the lockdown.\nIn a statement, Johnson\u2019s fiancee Carrie Symonds said she \u201ccannot thank our magnificent NHS enough\u201d: \u201cThe staff at St Thomas\u2019 hospital have been incredible. I will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThere were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones. Thank you also to everyone who sent such kind messages of support.

        "content": "His options are to reimpose austerity, follow the post-war approach or use monetary finance\nIt\u2019s a while until payday and a big, unexpected bill has arrived. The money will eventually be there but in the meantime, there is a cash flow problem. Most of us have been there \u2013 and Rishi Sunak is no different.\nThe chancellor has a whopping cash flow problem. Locking down the economy in response to the Covid-19 pandemic means that tax revenues have dried up at a time when the state is promising to spend billions more on health, wage subsidies, small business grants and universal credit.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the state\u2019s spending to exceed its revenue and when it does the gap is normally covered by borrowing. The government sells bonds \u2013 or gilts \u2013 to investors and uses the proceeds to plug the hole.\nIn the current crisis, the government\u2019s need for ready cash is so great it can\u2019t get the gilts out of the door quickly enough. Fortunately, though, Sunak has an understanding bank manager in the form of Andrew Bailey. The governor of the Bank of England, has agreed to solve the Treasury\u2019s cashflow problem by printing as much money as the chancellor needs provided Sunak agrees to pay off his overdraft by the end of the year.\nThis may sounds a bit technical, but it matters a lot. For the time being the economy is effectively being kept going by the state. Only bits of the private sector are operating as normal and the longer the lockdown the bigger the bill for the Treasury. All of which raises the question of how it is to be paid for. More specifically, does the use of the government\u2019s overdraft facility mean that the UK is heading down a road that ends with the Bank printing money to pay for government spending?\nHow the government goes about footing the bill for Covid-19 depends on the scale of the economic damage, but it is already clear that early estimates of a short, sharp shock were too optimistic. The current crisis looks likely to prove more costly than the recession of 2008-09, until now the deepest slump of the post-war era.\nSunak has options. The first is to do what George Osborne did in 2010 and impose a period of belt-tightening as soon as the recession ends. This would involve an austerity budget \u2013 or more likely a series of austerity budgets \u2013 in which taxes would be raised and spending cut in order to reduce the size of the government\u2019s annual budget deficits.\nThis option is unlikely to prove all that attractive. The lesson of the Osborne experiment is that trying to get the deficit down too fast leads to sluggish growth, which reduces tax revenues and means it takes longer to reduce borrowing. Moreover, the tightest financial settlements on the NHS in its history left the health service poorly prepared to cope with a pandemic. There will be political uproar if Sunak goes to the austerity route.\nA second option is to to follow the example of post-war governments and rely on a mixture of growth and inflation to restore the public finances to good health over time. Between 1939 and 1945, the wartime government ran annual budget deficits of 20% of national output or more. National debt \u2013 a measure of the budget surpluses and deficits accumulated over centuries \u2013 rose to 250% of gross domestic product. Yet over the next half century, the debt to GDP ratio gradually came down to stand at around 30% by the turn of the millennium.\nBorrowing is currently dirt cheap for the government, so Sunak could decide to get the economy fully functioning again before worrying too much about the public finances. The lesson from the decades after 1945 is that governments only really have a deficit problem if they have a growth problem.\nThe third option is monetary finance, under which the Bank of England is instructed to print enough money to cover whatever the government chooses to spend. In the short-term, this is precisely what Bailey is doing with his overdraft facility. There are those who say it should be made permanent in order to help rebuild the economy and prepare it for the challenges of global heating.\nThe temporary nature of the overdraft means that it is not really monetary finance. Gordon Brown\u2019s government made use of the same arrangement during the financial crisis of 2008-09 but paid its \u00a320bn overdraft off within two months. Sunak has promised to pay off his overdraft by the end of the year, which he could do either by selling more gilts or by raising taxes. Alternatively, he could decide that his overdraft \u2013 on which he only has to pay 0.1% interest \u2013 is far too useful to dispense with in the current circumstances.\nNo question, going down the monetary finance route means a line will have been crossed. The Bank of England\u2019s independence would be called into question. Fears that printing money would lead to runaway inflation would be stoked.\nBut the lines are getting pretty blurred anyway. Back in 2009, the Bank of England launched a money creation programme known as quantitative easing. It involved Threadneedle Street buying gilts and corporate bonds from the private sector in return from cash. It was not strictly monetary financing because the Bank did not buy the gilts directly from the government and it pledged that it would later sell them again. No gilts or other assets have been sold, although the Bank and the Treasury like to maintain the fiction that they will be.\nSo, yes, Sunak\u2019s overdraft may prove to be temporary. But that was what was said 11 years ago about ultra-low interest rates and QE. In a crisis what was once taboo can quickly become mainstream.",

The \u201ctea and empathy\u201d scheme, called Project Wingman, is proving popular with hospitals.\nFielding and colleagues from a number of airlines including easyJet, Virgin, Norwegian and SAS opened their first \u201cfirst-class lounge\u201d in the Whittington hospital in London two weeks ago, and then another at the nearby North Middlesex hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s about using the skills aircrew have to spoil hospital staff and make them feel they\u2019re special. They come off shift exhausted and weary and come into our lovely lounge and we pamper them, in the same way that passengers in first-class lounges at airports are used to being looked after. NHS staff aren\u2019t used to being treated like that.\n\u201cAircrew are good with people. We know how to ask the right questions and make people feel at their ease, as that\u2019s what we do as crew. We\u2019re now doing that in the NHS rather than in planes\u201d.\nThe crew involved in Project Wingman are opening a similar facility this week in five other hospitals \u2013 two in the capital, two in Essex and one in Kent \u2013 and have a growing number of hospitals now asking if they can have a first-class lounge created on their site too.\nThe initiative is the brainchild of Fielding, Emma Henderson, an easyjet pilot, and Prof Rob Bor, a psychologist at the Royal Free hospital in London. Fielding, who usually flies an Airbus A380 to Singapore, and Henderson, whose usual routes include Europe and North Africa, run the peer support programme for pilots with their respective airlines, while Bor helps airlines look after their pilots\u2019 mental health.\nHenderson says: \u201cGiven our profession the name Project Wingman is a light-hearted nod to Top Gun. But more importantly it is rooted in the idea that someone is there to support you. That\u2019s what we are offering to NHS frontline staff, as they are working hard to support those most in need.\n\u201cLike many others I just want to give back to the NHS at this critical time and the aim is to do what we can to support those at forefront of dealing with this health emergency. Rob came up with the idea. He could see that those working in hospitals at this time would benefit from some additional practical support.\u201d\nFielding spends much of his time in the first-class lounge that has sprung up at the back of the Whittington\u2019s canteen on its first floor. Henderson, however, does most of the organisational work to recruit more aircrew as Project Wingman volunteers and roll it out to other hospitals, as the fact that she lives with a vulnerable person means she cannot put herself in a hospital setting.\nInitially, says Fielding, \u201cstaff want to talk about anything apart from Covid: about aeroplanes, places they\u2019ve been and would like to visit, holidays they\u2019re hoping to have, their fear of flying. We also get occasional aviation geeks and even had a doctor who wants to be a pilot.\u201d\nHowever, once a bond of trust has been created, adds the 52-year-old pilot, hospital staff often open up. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to hear stories from them about what a tough time they\u2019ve had that day, dealing with Covid patients.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about seeing the amount of death, and the volume of sick and dying patients. With almost every ward in the [Whittington] hospital a Covid ward now, it\u2019s hard to escape. I\u2019m astonished that they all have their own strategies for switching off. The beauty of Project Wingman is that it\u2019s a little bit of escape from this grind.\u201d\nMaria Kane, the chief executive at North Middlesex hospital, says that her staff are finding real comfort in the presence of fellow professionals in uniform who are there to help them.\n\u201cRecreating a \u2018first-class lounge\u2019 experience is such a great idea. The \u2018tea and empathy\u2019 and cake, a cheerful welcome and time to listen all helps. The Project Wingman crews are here all day. For our staff who are working in the most extraordinary circumstances of their careers, facing really hard and stressful situations for their patients and with their colleagues, this is a real bonus to begin to help with the stresses and emotions they are experiencing.",

They separated and when Leah was nine, she and her mother moved to her grandparents\u2019 strongly Jewish household in Mannheim, and she went to a Jewish school in Ulm. Hitler seized power in Germany when Leah was a teenager, and she never lost the fear that discrimination could lead to genocide.\nShe was able to leave Germany in 1938, by means of an arranged marriage, which was later annulled. She left behind her widowed grandmother, her mother (who later died in a concentration camp), and her friends and relatives, to travel to Palestine. There, after nursing training, she met and married Louis Shaw, a Jewish British soldier, and in 1945 they settled in the UK, where Louis joined his family\u2019s furniture business in London.\nHe and Leah lived in Brixton and later Northolt, and had a son and two daughters. Before the war, Louis had trained as a draughtsman; in 1957 he got a job working for Lucas\u2019s in Birmingham, and the family moved to Solihull. There Leah got involved in the Polygon discussion group, a chance to share and learn about radical ideas, and also joined the local CND branch. Later she made frequent visits to Greenham Common and took part in demonstrations.\nWhen Louis died in 1967, to help with finances Leah began to let rooms in the family home to language assistants in the local schools, from countries including Germany, Spain, Austria and France. Over the years, she had perhaps more than 50 lodgers, many of whom became her firm friends. They recall visits to the cinema in Leah\u2019s blue Mini, and long discussions about feminism, non-violence, political awareness and the struggle against discrimination.\nLeah loved reading and one lodger estimated that her book collection ran into the thousands. She was a student on a WEA literature course in Kenilworth for more than 30 years; even after she moved to Stourbridge in her later years she still managed a weekly train journey to attend the class for some time, and she was still attending meetings of her book group in Stourbridge until the age of 98.\nAnother lodger wrote of Leah\u2019s \u201cunreserved acceptance of LGBTQ+ people\u201d. Friends recall her amazing memory (her thoughts on life were included in a 1985 book A Wealth of Experience: Lives of Older Women by Susan Hemmings ) and her interest in humanism (I met Leah more than 50 years ago through the Birmingham Humanist Group).\nShe is survived by her children, Jonathan, Devorah and Judith, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.",

But yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe.\u201d\nHe held up Germany as an example of a country with a lower death rate that had \u201cvery early on introduced testing on a scale that was remarkable and continued to do that and isolate individuals and look after those who got very sick\u201d.\n\u201cBy isolating those that were positive it meant they weren\u2019t able to infect other people,\u201d he said. There were undoubtedly lessons to learn from that, he added.\nWith the UK considering ways to end its lockdown, Farrar said testing in the community had been a way for Germany to buy time to deal with the crisis. It had given it an additional six to eight weeks to ensure health systems were up to capacity, he said.\nOn the same programme, Alok Sharma, the business secretary, avoided the question of whether the UK was at risk of having the worst death rate in Europe. On Friday, its daily hospital death toll was 980, higher than either Italy or Spain before their curves started to flatten.\nFrance has recorded a daily death toll of more than 1,000, but unlike the UK, it has been including mortality in care homes in its daily figures.\nSharma said it was a global pandemic and that different countries were at different stages in the spread of the disease. He insisted that the measures the UK had taken were on course to slow the trend of number of deaths and the advice to stay at home was aimed at flattening the curve.\nLater, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, did not dispute Farrar\u2019s analysis, but said the government was advised by many different experts and that the future spread of the virus was \u201cunknowable\u201d. He said it underlined the importance of the government\u2019s advice to stay at home during Easter.\nA disputed recent study from world-leading disease data analysts projected that the UK would become the country worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe.\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle predicted 66,000 UK deaths from Covid-19 by August, but this was revised down to 37,000 later because of the recent slowing in the increase of the death rate.\nThe 66,000 figure had been rejected by scientists whose modelling of the probable shape of the UK epidemic is relied on by the government. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said the IHME figures on \u201chealthcare demand\u201d \u2013 including hospital bed use and deaths \u2013 were twice as high as they should be.\nIn March, the Imperial College London team said the number of deaths could reach 260,000 in the UK with no restrictions on movement, but they hoped to get this down to 20,000 with the lockdown strategy.\n This article was amended on 12 April 2020 to include reference to the IHME\u2019s prediction for UK deaths from Covid-19 being revised down from 66,000 to 37,000.",

        "content": "Owners call for solutions after being told they will not receive payouts for disruption\nSome of Britain\u2019s biggest insurance companies are facing legal action from small business owners who say their legitimate business interruption claims have been unfairly turned down.\nFollowing the forced closure of thousands of businesses across the UK, insurers across the board were quick to change their policy terms in an attempt to rule out claims arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAlthough several large insurers including Allianz, Aviva and Axa do not provide cover, some insurers, most notably Hiscox, sold policies before Covid-19 hit the headlines, stating they will pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease.\nBusiness interruption policies typically pay up to \u00a3100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.\nBusiness owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers in recent days, only to be told their policies don\u2019t cover the pandemic.\nLast week, the Financial Conduct Authority told insurers to halt dividend payments to allow them to pay claims. It had already told insurers it expects them to treat customers fairly.\nA group of brokers and loss adjusters havejoined forces and will ask a barrister to examine the policies, with a view to taking legal action.\nThe Hiscox Action Group said the firm\u2019s policies clearly state they will pay up where the interruption to the business was \u201cdue to restrictions imposed by a public authority following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease\u201d.\nOther insurers, including Eaton Gate, have similar terms and expected to face similar legal action in the coming months, the group said.\nAlan Dexter, who runs four restaurants in Glasgow, including Barsa Tapas, said two of his premises have business interruption cover provided by Hiscox but his claims were last week denied. He has been forced to put his 140 staff on furlough because of the crisis.\nDexter said: \u201cOur broker pointed out that the cover states we can claim in the event of a notifiable disease, and, to my untrained eye, the policy appears to cover the exact circumstance I and many other business owners find themselves in. But after taking several days, Hiscox last week came back and said it would not be paying our claim. The company markets itself in its publicity material as the insurer that always pays out, but that has not been my experience.\u201d\nRoger Topping, who runs TopMark Adjusters, a Glasgow-based firm of loss adjusters and one of those behind the legal challenge, has called on the insurers to pay or for the government to step in.\nTopping said: \u201cWe have heard ministers tell insurers to pay these claims but, to my knowledge, not a single insurer has broken ranks and paid a claim. This is not just a Hiscox issue, several other companies including Eaton Gate, an insurer backed by Royal Sun Alliance, are in a similar position. It seems that the massive losses involved have caused the insurance industry to start searching for reasons not to pay.\u201d\nHe called for the government and insurers to find a solution before \u201ca multitude of legal actions against insurers begin, and massive sums of money are wasted on legal fees. We need something along the lines adopted previously for claims following riots, flooding, or what we saw in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles.\u201d\nHiscox said: \u201cWe understand that these are incredibly difficult times for businesses affected by Covid-19. At Hiscox we strive to pay claims that are covered by the policies fairly and quickly.\n\u201cHowever, general business interruption policies across the industry, including Hiscox\u2019s, were not designed to cover these extraordinary circumstances. Like terrorism and flood, which have government-backed insurance schemes, pandemics like coronavirus are simply too large and too systemic for private insurers to cover,\u201d it added.\nLast month, the Association of British Insurers told parliament\u2019s business committee that few companies would be protected for their losses by their insurance policies.",

Their proximity to other users would be logged, and they would follow advice given in alerts to self-isolate \u2013 even in cases where they were not aware of having been in contact with someone infected.\nHancock told the press conference: \u201cToday I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing. If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you\u2019ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly.\u201d\nThere have been concerns about privacy given the app would track people\u2019s movements and their contacts. But Hancock said: \u201cAll data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research, and we won\u2019t hold it any longer than it\u2019s needed. And as part of our commitment to transparency, we\u2019ll be publishing the source code too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already testing this app and as we do this we\u2019re working closely with the world\u2019s leading tech companies and renowned experts in digital safety and ethics.\u201d\nDigital contact tracing has been a central part of the containment strategy in China and other countries attempting to suppress new outbreaks of the virus.\nIt is considered to be one of the ways that the UK could gradually leave its state of lockdown, if people are told to isolate immediately after coming into contact with those who are unwell so that they avoid potentially passing it on even if symptomless.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would look at the need for safeguards for people\u2019s privacy and data.\nRebecca Hilsenrath, its chief executive, said: \u201cWe support the use of technology to save lives during the pandemic. At the same time it must have the appropriate safeguards in place to protect people\u2019s privacy and data.\n\u201cThe right to privacy is one of our most precious rights and it is good to hear the Health Secretary give assurances of handling this information with the highest ethical standards and for the shortest period necessary. We will be contacting the NHS to offer our advice and assistance in what they will need to consider.\u201d",

He reflected the general bafflement among many experts, because \u201cherd immunity\u201d is typically achieved via widespread vaccination against a disease.\nThere is no vaccine for Covid-19, and \u201cherd immunity\u201d without a vaccine assumes that the vast majority of people who recover from the coronavirus will then be immune, which has not yet been conclusively established.\n  Hancock set out the government\u2019s position in an article for the Sunday Telegraph on 14 March, explicitly denying that it was aiming for herd immunity. \u201cWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.\u201d\n  Asked about the \u201cherd immunity\u201d concept on Andrew Marr\u2019s BBC political programme the following day, Hancock emphasised: \u201cHerd immunity is not our policy, it\u2019s not our goal.\u201d\n  Yet still, by around 23 March, a planning document used by NHSX, the health service\u2019s digital planning department, and Faculty, a British artificial intelligence company contracted to aid the response to the Covid-19 outbreak, included \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d as one of several government \u201cinterventions\u201d whose impact upon the spread of the disease could be examined via computer simulations.\n  In a list headed \u201cscenarios/interventions\u201d that could be modelled, the document includes \u201cintervention analyses\u201d of policies such as social distancing and schools closures, which the government introduced incrementally from 16 March. Below those the document lists: \u201cTargeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population).\u201d\n  Later in the document, a list of interventions that \u201crequire no new simulation dynamics\u201d of the computer modellers comprises social distancing, school closures, \u201ctargeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)\u201d, household quarantine and \u201carea quarantine\u201d.\nLawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed herd immunity simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussion and never took place. In a statement, Faculty said it was \u201cenormously proud\u201d of the work it was doing for NHSX, saying its \u201cvisualisations and forecasts\u201d would allow decision-makers to make faster and more informed decisions. \u201cThis work is saving lives.\u201d\n  The first revelation that the government might be looking to create \u201cherd immunity\u201d came on 11 March from Dr David Halpern, the chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, known as the \u201cnudge unit\u201d. No physical distancing measures were in place at that time; all schools, workplaces, pubs, restaurants and social events were still open and going ahead, and the government\u2019s only advice was that people with Covid-19 symptoms should self-isolate for a week.\nHalpern suggested to the BBC that the government was pursuing a policy like the one outlined in the NHSX and Faculty planning document seen by the Guardian.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don\u2019t catch the disease,\u201d Halpern said. \u201cBy the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.\u201d\n  On 13 March, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, defended the existing approach and said that building up some form of herd immunity, by having potentially 60% of the population (40 million people) contract Covid-19, was one of the \u201ckey things we need to do\u201d.\n  Hancock made his public denials the following day. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) began to issue public guidance that said: \u201cHerd immunity is not part of our action plan but is a natural by-product of an epidemic.\u201d\n  That, however, still suggests that, despite the lockdown measures introduced on 23 March, the government does envisage a large proportion of the population contracting Covid-19, then recovering and having immunity, and for that to prevent the further spread of the virus.\nSome medical experts maintain that, in the absence of widespread testing of people and tracing those they may have infected, this remains the government\u2019s policy: to contemplate most of the population ultimately becoming infected, and eventually achieve herd immunity.\n  The DHSC did not respond to a question about why \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d was listed on an NHSX document as a specific intervention to be modelled for its impact on the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian, is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty.",

One NHS document suggests that, two weeks ago, Faculty considered running a computer simulation to assess the impact of a policy of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d. Lawyers for Faculty said the proposed herd immunity simulation never took place.\nNHSX, the digital transformation arm of the National Health Service that has contracted the tech companies to help build the \u201cCovid-19 datastore\u201d, said the technology would give ministers and officials \u201creal-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed\u201d.\n\u201cThe companies involved do not control the data and are not permitted to use or share it for their own purposes,\u201d a spokesperson said. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said the firm only had access to aggregated or anonymised data via NHS systems.\nThe government had previously said it would use Faculty and Palantir in a Covid-19 data project. But the full scope of that operation, and the sensitive nature of patient-level data being used, is revealed in the documents seen by the Guardian.\nOne portion of the project involves giving leaders in the NHS, Cabinet Office and Downing Street a live feed of \u201caggregate\u201d statistics on hospitalisations, availability of critical care beds, ventilator orders and oxygen supplies.\nHowever, the documents also appear to show the project includes large volumes of data pertaining to individuals, including protected health information, Covid-19 test results, the contents of people\u2019s calls to the NHS health advice line 111 and clinical information about those in intensive care.\nWhile such data will be anonymised, it remains sensitive and confidential, and its use on a centralised new government database is likely to raise questions among privacy experts. A Whitehall source said they were alarmed at the \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of confidential health information being swept up in the project, which they said was progressing at alarming speed and with insufficient regard for privacy, ethics or data protection.\nThe documents also suggest that:\nWhile anonymised, confidential 111 information in the Covid-19 datastore may include people\u2019s gender, postcode, symptoms, the mechanism through which any prescription was dispatched to them, and the precise time they ended the call.\nThe project appears to be using a \u201cpseudo NHS number\u201d to cross-match large datasets, including a master patient index, an existing NHS resource that uses \u201csocial marketing data\u201d to segment the British population into different \u201ctypes\u201d at household level.\nWhile not a current priority, phone location data could be used in the datastore after it was \u201coffered\u201d to the government by two private companies for help with contact tracing. The NHS declined to say which companies had offered the location data or how it would be used.\nFaculty\u2019s proposed simulation of a policy described as \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d was part of an NHSX and Faculty planning document considered around 23 March, more than a week after ministers insisted the controversial policy was no longer being contemplated.\nLawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussions. The planning document listed potential analysis of the impact of \u201ctargeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)\u201d alongside other possible government policies such as social distancing, school closures and household quarantines.\nThe document was considered by senior NHS officials more than a week after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tried to draw a line under the government\u2019s controversial flirtation with the strategy of herd immunity, which involves enough people contracting the disease to develop population\u2013level resistance.\nThe NHS said the data in the Covid-19 datastore would remain under its control and be subject to severe restrictions under data protection legislation. \u201cStrict data protection rules apply to everyone involved in helping in this critical task,\u201d an NHSX spokesperson said.\nHowever, the Guardian was able to see confidential documents used by Palantir, Faculty and NHSX officials to plan, develop and execute the Covid-19 datastore. It is unclear who was responsible for making the documents \u2013 which did not contain NHS patient data \u2013 accessible via an unrestricted portal.\nThe Whitehall source described the open accessibility of the documents as a \u201cshocking data breach\u201d. Palantir did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said there had been no breach of patient or other sensitive NHS data.\nThe involvement of private sector data scientists at the heart of the government\u2019s Covid-19 response stems in part from a Downing Street \u201csummit\u201d on 11 March attended by executives from dozens of tech firms, chaired by the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, an enthusiast of artificial intelligence and computer modelling.\nFaculty, which had a pre-existing contract to build an artificial intelligence lab for the NHS, took on a leading role in the data response to the pandemic. It is run by Marc Warner, whose brother, Ben, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street by Cummings after running the Conservative party\u2019s private election model.\nBen Warner, who used to be a principal at his brother\u2019s AI company, is said to have worked closely with Cummings on the modelling programme used in the Vote Leave campaign to leave the European Union. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said its NHS contract was the result of a tender process that was not influenced by Cummings. \n Faculty said in a statement it was \u201cenormously proud\u201d of its work for the NHS, which it said was helping save lives. \u201cFaculty is not dealing with personally identifiable information. Faculty is helping to develop dashboards, models and simulations to provide key central government decision-makers with a deeper level of information about the current and future coronavirus situation to help inform the response.\u201d\n Palantir\u2019s role in the project involves integrating NHS datasets with the US company\u2019s data-management platform, Foundry. Microsoft, Google and Amazon products are also being used on the datastore project, but staff at those companies are understood to be less directly involved.\nSenior NHS officials have insisted the operation is only temporary, saying: \u201cWhen the pandemic abates and the outbreak is contained, we will close the Covid-19 datastore.\u201d However, the Whitehall source said there was lingering concerns in the civil service that the powerful new apparatus could outlast the crisis.\nNeither Downing Street nor Cummings responded to a request for comment. Lawyers for Faculty said Cummings did not request the proposed simulation on herd immunity, and was not the mastermind of the datastore.

He describes mild symptoms for 24 hours including a temperature. He says that he will continue to lead the government.\nSaturday 28 March\nSecretary of state for business Alok Sharma tells reporters: \u201cCan I be absolutely clear the PM has had mild symptoms, he is absolutely leading the response from the front.\u201d\nMonday 30 March\nJohnson chairs cabinet by remote video link. But newspapers later report that Downing Street sources say Johnson has been \u201ccoughing and spluttering his way through conference calls\u201d.\nWednesday 1 April\nJohnson posts a video, urging people to stay at home and saying that those with symptoms like his should stay at home. He says that \u201calthough I am sequestered \u2026 I am able to be in constant touch with my officials\u201d and says he is \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d we will beat it together.\nThursday 2 April\nWhen asked if the prime minister had a temperature, a Downing Street spokesman says only that he continues to have \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. Johnson appears on the steps of No 11 Downing Street \u2013 where his apartment is - to join the second \u201cClap for our Carers\u201d event. Some observers suggest that Johnson looks unwell in pictures. Aides say he will be coming out of self-isolation on Friday.\nFriday 3 April\nJohnson is unable to leave quarantine after seven days of self-isolation because he still has a persistent temperature. He posts a video on Twitter saying that although he is feeling better \u201cin accordance with government advice I must continue to self-isolate\u201d. But he says that he continues to work.\nLobby correspondents are told Johnson had only mild symptoms of the illness and that he chaired the morning coronavirus meeting with ministers and officials.\nSaturday 4 April\nJohnson\u2019s pregnant partner Carrie Symonds reveals that she has had the main symptoms of coronavirus for the past week but is \u201con the mend\u201d. It is reported that Johnson is \u201cstubbornly refusing to stop working\u201d, with the Mail on Sunday reporting a source as saying: \u201cHe has not been resting enough and is still leading from the front. Obviously that is beginning to slow down his recovery. He needs to go to bed.\u201d\nSunday 5 April\nHealth secretary Matt Hancock tells Sky News: \u201cHe\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve been talking to him every day, several times a day \u2026 he\u2019s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he\u2019s still got a temperature \u2026 He\u2019s working away inside Downing Street. He\u2019s in good spirits.\u201d\nBut later Downing Street says that Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests \u201cas a precautionary step\u201d because his symptoms are persistent 10 days after he tested positive.\nMonday 6 April\nMorning\nCabinet minister Robert Jenrick tells BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.\u201d\nA government spokesman says that the prime minister is in \u201cgood spirits\u201d while continuing to work on his red box of government papers.\nAsked whether Johnson had pneumonia, the spokesman says that any change in his condition would be communicated to the public. But he acknowledges that the prime minister continues to have a cough and a temperature 11 days after first reporting symptoms.\nAfternoon\nA tweet from Johnson\u2019s account says that he has gone into hospital for routine tests \u201cas I\u2019m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms\u201d. It goes on: \u201cI\u2019m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.\u201d\nAt the daily press briefing, foreign secretary Dominic Raab says that the prime minister is \u201cstill in charge\u201d from his hospital bed. He adds: \u201cHe was admitted as a precaution only as because some of his symptoms have persisted. He is in good spirits and is still in charge of the government.\n\u201cHe is being given regular updates on developments and he continues to lead the government.\u201d Raab acknowledges that he has not spoken to Johnson since Saturday.\nAt the same briefing, chief medical officer Chris Whitty is asked if Johnson could have pneumonia. He says: \u201cThis is a question for him and his medical advisers, who are outstanding. I am absolutely not going to discuss any individual patient and I do not have the full details, nor should I.\u201d\nEvening\nDowning Street issues a statement saying that the prime minister\u2019s condition has \u201cworsened\u201d over the course of the afternoon. It continues: \u201cOn the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.\u201d\nRaab is asked to deputise for him where necessary, the statement says. It notes that Johnson is receiving \u201cexcellent care\u201d.\nTuesday 7 April\nDowning Street says the PM\u2019s condition remains stable and he is in good spirits following his first night in intensive care but he would need to remain there for close monitoring.\nConcerns are raised about how the government will make key decisions about the pandemic in Johnson\u2019s absence\nWednesday 8 April\nJohnson is said to be in a stable condition and responding to treatment after a second night in intensive care.\nRishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, said the prime minister was sitting up in bed and engaging positively with medical staff.\nThursday 9 April\nThe prime minister is moved back on to a general hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care. He is in extremely good spirits, Downing Street says.\nIn response, Symonds posts a tweet a painting of a rainbow with 26 clapping emojis.\nAt the daily briefing Raab says that he has not spoken to Johnson since he went in to hospital but insisted that the government was functioning smoothly.\nFriday 10 April\nJohnson is in good spirits and \u201cenormously grateful for the care he\u2019s receiving\u201d, a number 10 spokesman says.\nStanley Johnson, the PM\u2019s father, expressed his relief in an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He says his son will need rest and the events may serve a wider purpose. \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s got the whole country to realise this is a serious event. If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven\u2019s sake, well it does come close to home.\u201d\nSaturday 11 April\nDowning Street says Johnson continues to make very good progress.\nJohnson issues a short statement thanking staff at St Thomas\u2019: \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough. I owe them my life.\u201d\nSunday 12 April\nJohnson is discharged after seven nights in St Thomas\u2019 and is taken to his country retreat, Chequers. Downing Street says the prime minister would be taking a break from work while he recovers.\nSymonds thanks staff at St Thomas\u2019 and everyone who sent a message of support. \u201cThere were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones.\u201d\nIn a video statement Johnson, in suit and tie, says the \u201cNHS has saved my life, no question\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe will win because our NHS is the beating heart of this country. It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love.\u201d\nHe paid tribute to the astonishing care he received from nurses and thanked, in particular, the \u201ctwo nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way. They\u2019re Jenny from New Zealand \u2026 and Luis from Portugal, near Porto.\n\u201cThe reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.\u201d",

        "content": "Available onlineGators and Zarabooshka, the first instalments in a new 14-part series of monologues by Philip Ridley, feature anxious characters marooned in confusing times\nThe dramatic monologue is emerging as a convenient form for online theatre as the industry adapts to the limitations of the coronavirus lockdown. There have been recent offerings from the Bunker Theatre and High Tide that are at once theatrical and eminently suited to film.\nNow comes The Beast Will Rise, a series of 14 monologues by Philip Ridley, a writer with a rich history of monologue plays that pack a punch, including Angry and Killer. The works that make up the serieswill be streamed on a weekly basis, in lieu of The Beast of Blue Yonder, Ridley\u2019s fantastical black comedy which was due to be staged at the Southwark Playhouse this month.\nThey enlist the same director, Wiebke Green, and are performed by members of the cast of The Beast of Blue Yonder. The first two works are simple in form: a female character sits speaking to a static camera, with little else in the frame. Both characters are marooned in a predatory world and exude a queasy mix of fear and loneliness, as well as a compulsive need to explain themselves. The plays capture our contemporary state of isolation and desperation \u2013 though with no mention of a virus.\nGators is 19 minutes long and based in a postdiluvian, dystopian world with fantastical edges. A woman (Rachel Bright) describes it to us from her living room, and it becomes clear that there has been a climate catastrophe. Since the flood, a generation have grown up with giant swamps in their neighbourhoods and 9ft alligators in their back gardens.\nThe \u2019gators, the woman says, have become \u201csweet\u201d on human beings, creeping out of the swamps to woo them. But their sinister stalking has turned into vengeful killing, and society lives in fear of being savaged. \u201cThe world\u2019s gone crazy and I haven\u2019t got an Uzi,\u201d the woman says tremulously as she swigs beer from a can and answers the questions of a voiceless interviewer behind the camera.\nThe play has a tacit message about environmental abuse, but the presence of the \u2019gators has a seductive side, too. In 2005, Ridley described his controversial production Mercury Fur, which involved extreme fantasies of sex and death, as \u201ca play about love. About what we do for love and what happens if there is a lack of love.\u201d As outlandish and otherworldly as its scenario seems, Gators deals with the same underlying desire. However macabre a love the \u2019gators represent to Bright\u2019s character, she has a need to be loved, and merely existing in her solitary, albeit safe, state, is not enough, it seems.\nThe world in Zarabooshka is more recognisable, and all the more discomforting for it. The sole character (Grace Hogg-Robinson) is of indeterminate age but looks like a girl. She sits on a stripped mattress and, although child sex abuse is not mentioned, there are heavy hints about human trafficking, captivity and the men who pay for girls\u2019 services and leave them bloodied afterwards.\nThe girl\u2019s reality only comes to us in interludes, between a fantasy world of picket fences and log fires that she is intent on retreating into. Imagination and make-believe, it is suggested, are her only solace in this brutal existence (\u201cWe\u2019re stuck where we\u2019re stuck and no one\u2019s going to unstick us,\u201d she says). The girl whispers to camera, her nose almost pressed to the lens, as if there is danger even in speaking aloud.\nHowever distressing her state is, there is a broad-brush generality to the story, which, at 11 minutes long, only ever reaches a certain emotional depth. But the girl\u2019s vulnerability is exquisitely rendered by Hogg-Robinson. In fact, both she and Bright lift these dramas with the intensity of their performances, and it is this, ultimately, that leaves our hairs on end.\n Gators and Zarabooshka are available online at wearetramp.com",

There has been no racing in Britain since 17 March, when the BHA abandoned a brief attempt to maintain a schedule behind closed doors and suspended all racing until 30 April. That came after the government withdrew emergency service support for non-essential activities and then banned public gatherings of more than two people.\nThe continuing suspension is thought to be costing the sport at least \u00a36m a month in terms of revenue from off-course betting alone, while several major Festival meetings have already been either cancelled or postponed. Almost all jockeys are freelancers and have been unable to work for three weeks, while all jump racing has been cancelled until at least 1 July.\nThe BHA has since been planning towards a possible resumption of some racing on 1 May and is understood to have identified several tracks, including Newcastle and Lingfield, which could stage regular meetings running for several days at a time. Jockeys and other staff could be accommodated in on-site hotels to comply with quarantine restrictions and reduce unnecessary travel. Newmarket, which has two courses and several thousand horses stabled nearby, is also thought to be high on the list for an early resumption.\nWhile much has been done to prepare for a quick return to racing whenever possible, the BHA\u2019s review of the current situation will also consider the likelihood of any easing of the lockdown measures which were introduced on 23 March. The government has warned that the lockdown is likely to be extended, and a three- or four-week extension would rule out a return to any racing until at least mid-May.\nChester\u2019s big May Festival meeting, which was due to open on 5 May, has already been cancelled as the track\u2019s city-centre location with viewing possible from outside the course would make it impossible to race behind closed doors while guaranteeing that it would not attract a crowd.\nBoth the Guineas meeting at Newmarket on the first weekend in May and the Derby meeting at Epsom in early June have been postponed, in the hope that it will be possible to test the three-year-old generation later in the year. Ascot, though, has said its prestigious Royal meeting, one of the most valuable and significant fixtures of the year for the racing, breeding and betting industries will take place behind closed doors from 16 June if the restrictions in place at the time allow it to proceed.",

He has targeted 1 May as the date when the country may begin a return to normalcy, and in a tweet on Sunday morning cited a drop in hospitalisations as \u201ca very good sign\u201d.\nBut Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert, stressed any such move should come only when it was safe and as a gradual process. He also warned of the danger of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases later in the year if things reopened too soon.\n\u201cIf you just say, \u2018OK, it\u2019s whatever, 1 May, click, turn the switch on,\u2019 obviously, if you do it in an all-or-none way, there\u2019s an extraordinary risk of there being a rebound,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThat could be a real problem. And everybody knows that.\n\u201cWhen one starts to relax some of those restrictions, we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. That is just reality. The critical issue is to be able to, in real time, identify, isolate and contact trace.\n\u201cObviously, New York, [which] is going through a terrible ordeal, is going to be very different from Arkansas, and very different maybe from some places on the west coast, like Washington state, which have been successfully able to prevent that big spike. I think it\u2019s going to have to be something that is not one size fits all.\u201d\nFauci was backed by Dr Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug administration (FDA).\n\u201cThe primary issue here is the safety and the welfare of the American people. That has to come first,\u201d Hahn told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, noting he had not felt political pressure on any decision. \u201cTesting is one component of the response to the outbreak, in addition to the mitigation effort \u2026 so all hands on deck to try to get more diagnostic tests in.\u201d\nWHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro made a grim prediction.\n\u201cWe think it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defences,\u201d he said, also on NBC.\nTrump has been highly critical of the WHO, in comments some have seen as scapegoating to deflect from the failures of his own administration.\n\u201cThe WHO works on behalf of all the governments in the world and it operates within mandates that are given to it,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cWe know there will be many things found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been, and we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. Right now, we have to move forward.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Sunday tweet appeared to indicate he was still keen to reopen the country sooner than later, having told Fox News on Saturday night he would seek advice from \u201cvery smart people\u201d. Last week, Trump announced he would establish a bipartisan \u201cOpening Our Country Council\u201d.\n\u201cA lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders are a lot of things that go into a decision like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it.\u201d\nAmong governors of hard-hit states, instincts tend towards caution. Phil Murphy of New Jersey told CNN 2,183 \u201cblessed souls\u201d had died in his state and repeated to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation: \u201cIf we start to get back on our feet too soon \u2026 we could be throwing gasoline on the fire.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Fox phone-in came ahead of another tweet in which he attacked the New York Times, which on Saturday reported that the White House failed to act on several explicit security agency warnings in January about the potential for coronavirus to spread to the US.\nTrump conflated reports on the outbreak and mis-represented Times reporting which said researchers think most Covid-19 cases in New York came from Europe \u2013 not that the virus had originated there.\n\u201cSo now the Fake News is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThis is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources?\u201d\nOn Wednesday, for example, The Times quoted Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review, as saying: \u201cThe majority [of New York cases] is clearly European [in origin].\u201d\nTrump also claimed the Times was \u201crecently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d\nTimes journalists were among Americans expelled by the Chinese government in response to the Trump administration limiting the numbers of Chinese citizens who can work for Chinese news organisations in the US.",

        "content": "Recognised as the best driver never to win an F1 world championship, Moss was revered and feted by his peers\nThat Sir Stirling Moss, who died on Sunday, remained one of the most well-known British racing drivers of any generation was in no little part down to the affection and admiration he engendered, which extended beyond motor racing and across the public consciousness. This was partly, of course, because he was the inspiration for the 1960s policemen\u2019s inquiry to speeding drivers: \u201cWho do you think you are? Stirling Moss?\u201d\nAfter a career cut short because of an accident, the other popular legacy he left was as the greatest driver of his time never to win the world championship. In truth, Moss transcended both of these footnotes. He was a driver of remarkable skill, of hard-edged determination to win allied to an uncompromising sense of sportsmanship, wit and a genuine joy in racing and life itself that was irrepressible.\nAdmired and feted by his peers and respected by drivers of note who have succeeded him, he was, crucially, also hugely successful in almost any car in any discipline, an all-round talent that ensured his place among the greats of the sport.\nWhen put in the context of when and with whom he was competing, that the F1 title eluded him in no way detracts from a record that is still inspiring. He was runner-up on four occasions \u2013 three times to the great Juan Manuel Fangio and once to Mike Hawthorn \u2013 and third three times before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 ended his career prematurely.\nFangio was at the peak of his powers when Moss joined him at Mercedes in 1955 and the British driver, often outspoken but always honest, insisted the Argentinian was the better driver. \u201cHe was the best Formula One driver of his day,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI knew that if I kept my eyes on him and followed his line, I would be very fast. But I saw no chance of being faster than him.\u201d\nHe did score notable victories against his great rival, however. He beat him to become the first Briton to win the British Grand Prix, at Aintree in 1955, and although Moss said he believed his teammate had let him win, Fangio always insisted this had not been the case.\nMoss recalled later: \u201cWhen I asked him, after the race, if he\u2019d held back, he said: \u2018No, you were quite simply the better driver today.\u2019\u201d\nIt was Moss\u2019s preference for privateer teams over manufacturers, alongside a determination to drive for British teams whenever he could, that contributed to missing out on the F1 title. After switching to Maserati after Mercedes, he drove for Vanwall and British Racing Motors before returning to Rob Walker\u2019s team for two of his most striking victories \u2013 at Monaco and the N\u00fcrburgring in 1961. Facing down the new V6 \u201csharknose\u201d Ferrari 156, his Lotus was underpowered, but his skill on the twists and turns of Monaco made up for the deficit and he won by 3.6sec, while at the Nordschleife, his decision to take wet tyres before the race proved decisive.\nA fierce competitor but great sportsman, Moss was scrupulously fair, as was displayed when he came closest to the title in 1958. Battling his countryman Hawthorn, the fight went to the final race of the season and his rival won by a point \u2013 a tiny margin that Hawthorn had maintained after a threat of being disqualified from the earlier Portuguese Grand Prix for reversing on the track. It had been Moss\u2019s fervent defence of his friend that ensured he kept the second place in that race that ultimately proved crucial in the championship.\nThe title might yet still have been his with a drive for Ferrari lined up for 1962. Enzo Ferrari believed Moss, alongside Tazio Nuvolari, to be one of the greatest drivers of all time. He desperately wanted him to drive for the Scuderia.\nSadly it was not to be, as the accident while racing for the Glover Trophy at Goodwood put Moss in a coma for a month and left him partially paralysed down his left side for six months. He later attempted a comeback but after a private test session admitted he no longer had the control and concentration required.\nHe had already scored many notable wins in sports cars. With an unbridled enthusiasm to test himself Moss gained a class win at Le Mans, victories in endurance racing at Sebring and Reims-Gueux as well as wins in the RAC Tourist Trophy and the Targa Florio.\nHe entered 527 races during his 14-year professional career, finished 375 of them and won 212. Indeed, he always chose the 1955 Mille Miglia as his best performance. It was one of the exceptional drives of his generation in a punishing race across 1,000km of public roads in Italy. Driving a Mercedes-Benz 300SLR he set a new record time and beat Fangio by 32min. His record still stands, with the race being outlawed as too dangerous two years later.\nHe recalled he and the navigator Denis \u201cJenks\u201d Jenkinson heading slightly unprepared for a humpback bridge. \u201cIn practice it had been flat-out, but that was only at about 80mph,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we arrived in the race, I was probably doing 170mph, and the damn thing took off. It was really frightening. All I could do was hope it would land true. We got away with it.\u201d\nAs he would throughout his life he succeeded with aplomb, embracing all that came with being a driver in the 50s and 60s. In conversation with his old friend John Surtees, the motorbike and F1 world champion, in 2012, he noted: \u201cWe did not have sponsors to tell us what to do, did we John? I imagine it would be a difficult decision: \u2018Shall I go and chase that bird or talk to Vodafone?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe drivers today get the same pleasure we got.\u201d\nMoss unashamedly loved what he did, yet all the time he was fully aware of just how dangerous the day job was. His remarkable success should be measured against his very real awareness of the risks involved in achieving it. Moss never underestimated the nature of racing, especially during a period when safety was coming a long second to speed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I loved the sport because of the danger,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fear of having a serious accident was always there; an ever-present black shadow lurking beside me in the car.\u201d\nThere was, however, no sign of him allowing it to affect him. His record will for ever attest that it was behind the wheel, where he so clearly belonged, that he should be remembered.",

        "content": "The voting saga engulfing the Scottish Professional Football League has taken an incredible turn after the league confirmed Dundee submitted a ballot paper on Friday which arrived after the club asked officials not to consider it.\nScottish clubs were asked to vote on a resolution that would abandon the season with current standings as final. The league took the unprecedented step of issuing an update on Friday evening, when all votes had not been cast. Key was the Championship element, where one more vote would determine the entire outcome. It soon emerged that Dundee\u2019s paper was missing from the tally; a signed and dated \u201cNo\u201d form from the club\u2019s managing director, John Nelms, was widely circulated on Saturday.\nIn a letter issued to clubs on Sunday the SPFL\u2019s chairman, Murdoch MacLennan, tried to explain this remarkable affair. \u201cOne Ladbrokes Championship club attempted to submit a voting slip, which did not reach the SPFL until late that [Friday] evening,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, at 6pm on Friday, that club had confirmed in writing to the SPFL that any attempted vote from that club should not be considered as cast. We have had a number of conversations with the chairman of that club over the weekend, in which he reiterated that his club had not yet voted on the SPFL resolution. The SPFL has proceeded on the basis of the unequivocal instruction from that club received at 6pm on Friday.\u201d\nDundee are yet to offer their side of events, with MacLennan\u2019s words unlikely to placate stunned observers. MacLennan insisted it is \u201cwrong\u201d to assert any payments to clubs, based on league placings, can be issued \u201cwithout a line being drawn under season 2019-20\u201d.\nRangers have called for an independent investigation and the suspension of Neil Doncaster, the SPFL\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI am entirely satisfied, based on all the information at my disposal, that the SPFL and its executives and legal advisers have acted wholly properly at every stage in this process,\u201d added MacLennan. Owing to a complete breakdown of trust, it is understood Rangers are unwilling to share what they believe to be key evidence with anyone other than an independent body.\nAnn Budge, the Hearts owner, is also heavily critical of the SPFL board. Budge feels clubs were coerced into accepting the resolution, which would have relegated hers from the top flight. \u201cThe board has clearly discussed and considered various options,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is exactly what we would expect of the board. However, to then dismiss all but one option and present only this option for a members\u2019 vote, within a very limited timescale, must surely raise the question of whether the board is attempting to unduly influence the members\u2019 decision-making process.\u201d\nBudge added that Hearts will propose temporary reconstruction of the league \u2013 namely an expanded Premiership \u2013 as was already rising on the SPFL\u2019s agenda. \u201cThis is a major embarrassment for Scottish football, one which I believe could so easily have been avoided,\u201d she added.",

        "content": "Aged seven in 1953, I sent the F1 driver a letter. Not only did he write back, he invited me to the paddock at Silverstone\nMy relationship with Stirling Moss started in 1953. I was seven. I lived in Coventry, then the heartland of Britain\u2019s, indeed Europe\u2019s, motor industry. The Jaguar car factory, then makers of sports cars that regularly won at the Le Mans 24 hour race, the most famous race on the calendar in the 1950s, was a couple of miles away. I was car crazy. To the chagrin of my parents, I wasn\u2019t interested in reading. Until, that is, I discovered motor racing magazines and, in the blink of an eye, I learned to read. My idol was Stirling Moss.\nI wrote him a letter in 1953, saying how much I admired him and wishing him every success. I didn\u2019t expect a reply. I was just a little kid in a small semi-detached 1930s house in Coventry, a city without much distinction apart from its car industry and its suffering in the blitz. Then soon after I got a letter from Stirling with some photos. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I wrote back.\nAnd there followed a correspondence that was to last until the late 50s, perhaps a little longer. My parents, moved by my passion for motor racing, took me to my first race, the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, in July 1954. I told Stirling that I would be going and he said: \u201cWhy not come and visit me in the paddock?\u201d He was driving a privately owned Maserati in the grand prix. I found him in the paddock behind the pits, talking to a cluster of admirers; I seem to remember being pretty tongue-tied in the presence of my hero. Our relationship continued: letters, Christmas cards, and meeting at least once a year at the British Grand Prix. He sent me birthday presents. When he was driving at the Argentinian Grand Prix, the only faraway race in those days, he would send me a postcard.\nIn the 1950s, Stirling Moss was not just my hero, he was many people\u2019s hero. He had a following way beyond motor racing. I guess the name Stirling had a certain romance to it. And he was a terrific driver. Compared with the drivers of today, he was the antihero: he never drove the best car in Formula One, with the exception of the Mercedes Benz in 1955. Otherwise he was almost invariably at the wheel of an inferior car. One reason for this was his loyalty to driving British. At the time, British cars were way off the pace in Formula One, with Ferraris and Maseratis dominant except in 1954-55 when Mercedes ruled. Moss was the inveterate underdog, the most gifted driver in a below-par car. By the late 1950s it was different, with the arrival of Vanwall, Cooper and Lotus. But even then Moss chose to drive a privately entered rather than a works Cooper or Lotus. It was as if he liked and needed a handicap. Winning was not everything.\nHe never won the world championship because he never had the best car. The year he came closest was 1958 when he drove for Vanwall and was pipped at the post by Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari, who became Britain\u2019s first world champion. But Moss\u2019s defeat shone another light on the nature of the man. Hawthorn was disqualified in the Portuguese Grand Prix but Moss pleaded on Hawthorn\u2019s behalf and his points for coming second were reinstated. Without Moss\u2019s intervention on his behalf, Hawthorn would not have become world champion, instead Moss would have been. For Moss it was not just a question of winning, but winning in the right way.\nHe was runner-up four times in the world drivers\u2019 championship. He won 16 of the 66 F1 races he competed in between 1951 and 1961. He was an all-rounder in a way that today\u2019s F1 drivers are not: they just do F1. At the 1954 British Grand Prix where I first met him, he drove in a saloon car race, a Formula 3 race and a sports car race as well as the grand prix. He was a fine sports car driver, one of his most famous victories being in the legendary Mille Miglia in 1955, a 1,000-mile open-road race around Italy. He was extraordinarily versatile. With typical modesty he always described the Argentinian Juan Manuel Fangio as the greatest driver of his era. I was never convinced, I always thought Moss was his equal, if not in the record books. Without question, Moss was one of F1\u2019s greatest ever drivers.\nAs many have previously said, it is impossible to compare drivers from different eras. Moss chose to drive second-rate machinery. Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton would never make such a choice. Winning as many grands prix and world championships as possible has become the religion. For Moss that was secondary. Moss always preferred to drive a British car: that kind of national loyalty disappeared long ago. He was a man of his time. If he had been born less than a decade earlier, he would have been a fighter pilot in the second world war: his preference for driving a car painted British racing green belonged to the early postwar era. His career finally came to an end in 1962 after an accident at Goodwood left him in a coma for a month and partially paralysed for six months. His condition was front page news for weeks on end. That he lived until the age of 90 was something of a miracle. A substantial number of his fellow racers during those years died at the wheel.\nMy correspondence with Stirling lasted, I guess, until my very early teens. As a kid I had always wanted to be a motor racing driver but by the age of 11 I was not so sure. My interest in motor racing waxed and waned over time, but to this day remains. Many years later, soon after I became editor of Marxism Today and now in my very early 30s, I bumped into Stirling at the top of Charing Cross Road. I introduced myself. He wanted to know my story. I thanked him for all his generosity when I was boy and just how much his friendship and kindness had meant to me. It was the last time I saw him.",

Instead, they must show a 30% revenue reduction.\nSpencer said commonwealth funding \u201cis vital for Christian schools across Australia\u201d.\n\u201cWe want to continue to support the government\u2019s position and provide a high-quality education and keep our students and staff safe in these very uncertain times.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, schools need funding certainty now to be able to plan for term two and beyond with any confidence.\u201d\nAt national cabinet on Thursday federal, state and territory leaders discussed how to develop a consistent national approach to which students should attend schools after the Easter holidays although no decisions were made.\nTehan defended his direction to independent schools, telling ABC TV that some \u201cweren\u2019t offering, for parents that had to work at all year levels, that opportunity for those students to be able to get that safe learning environment\u201d.\nOn Sunday Tehan said the federal government \u201cwants all schools open\u201d.\nHe noted states and territories had \u201cput in place different arrangements\u201d contrasting the Northern Territory, where students are required to attend school in person in term two, with Victoria and New South Wales which \u201care encouraging parents to, if they can, to have their students study at home\u201d.\n\u201cBut what the nationally consistent approach is, when it comes to parents who have to work and vulnerable children, schools have to be open and have to make sure that they provide a safe learning environment for those children.\u201d\nOn Sunday Tehan announced a support package for the university sector, promising their $18bn commonwealth grants scheme funding for 2020 will be paid even if enrolments fall.\nUniversities Australia, which along with Labor have called for a more generous support package, welcomed the package as a good first step but warned it would not be enough to stop an estimated 21,000 job losses in the sector.",

It carries a fine-print disclaimer that Mayfair\u2019s investment products are \u201cnot the same\u201d as a bank term deposit and might be seen as carrying a higher risk.\nCached versions of the termdepositguide.com site show it was previously online from July to October 2018, and offered to connect Australians with \u201cterm deposit money\u201d to options for \u201calternate investment products\u201d. Mayfair would not say whether it ran the site at the time.\nThe site has been marketed via paid advertising to Google, which meant it showed as a top sponsored result for searches of \u201cterm deposit\u201d and \u201cbank term deposit\u201d.\nAsic wrote to Google, which removed the site from its search results. Mayfair then added the disclaimer.\nAs recently as Sunday night, advertisements for the site continued to appear on YouTube, which is also owned by Google.\nOn 21 March the domain for a new site, tearupyourtermdesposit.com, was registered. The site, which listed Mayfair 101 as its owner, published similar content comparing term deposits to Mayfair\u2019s investments. The page appeared prominently in Google search results for term deposits last week. It has now been taken offline.\nAsic\u2019s concerns about Mayfair relate primarily to its attempts to market itself to investors; its products are only available to so-called \u201cwholesale\u201d investors who have assets of at least $2.5m or are able to tip $500,000 into a single investment, though Mayfair 101 has advertised heavily in mass circulation newspapers, including Brisbane\u2019s Courier Mail.\nIn a concise statement of claim, filed with the court, Asic objected to the use of phrases including \u201cterm deposit alternative\u201d, \u201ccertainty\u201d and \u201cconfidence\u201d in promotions for the products.\nIt also objected to Mayfair 101 marketing the products using Google Adword keywords including \u201cbank deposits\u201d and \u201cterm deposits\u201d, as well as metatags \u2013 keywords on pages that are not displayed but are used by search engines to categorise websites \u2013 including \u201cterm deposit rates \u2013 best term deposit options\u201d.\nThe products \u201cwere marketed to wholesale but inexperienced investors, at least a substantial subset of whom were unlikely to understand the significant risk associated with them\u201d, Asic alleged.\nIt also alleged Mayfair 101 \u201cmade representations to consumers that the Mayfair products were comparable to, and of similar risk profile to, bank term deposits\u201d when they actually had a higher risk.\nBank term deposits are issued by large financial institutions and protected by a government-run financial claims scheme while Mayfair\u2019s products are issued by a privately-owned group that invests in real estate and technology companies and have no government safety net.\nMayfair 101 referred Guardian Australia to an online statement regarding the Asic legal action. It said the group maintains its financial products are \u201cfully compliant\u201d with the law and will contest the Asic proceedings.\n\u201cMayfair 101 has cooperated with all Asic\u2019s information requests and has already added additional information to its website and materials to further ensure investors are fully informed about the risks and rewards of its investment products,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cThe Mayfair 101 group will contest Asic\u2019s claims in full.\u201d\nThe legal proceedings relate specifically to two financial products \u2013 M Core Fixed Income and M+ Fixed Income.\nMayfair froze redemptions of the two products on 11 March, about the same time it began suspending scheduled settlements of up to 60 investment properties it is contracted to buy at Mission Beach, the onshore hub for Dunk Island.\nAsic said 12 investors had been unable to redeem $4.4m from their M+ Fixed Income.\nMayfair says the \u201crisks and benefits are clearly stated on all Mayfair Platinum\u2019s disclosure documents\u201d.\n\u201cNo investor in any of Mayfair Platinum\u2019s products has had a capital loss and all interest distributions have been paid in full.\u201d",

        "content": "The Greens asked officials to calculate the cost of shutting down the native forest timber industry immediately rather than 2030 as planned\nEnding native forest logging in Victoria immediately, rather than phasing it out by 2030 as the state government plans, would save taxpayers $192m over the next decade, according to an estimate by the state\u2019s independent budget office.\nThe Victorian Greens asked the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) to calculate what it would cost to shut down the native forest timber industry in the state now, including bringing forward the government\u2019s promised $120m transition package for the industry and workers.\nThe assessment, seen by the Guardian, found there would be an overall $15.3m cost to the budget over the next three years as lost revenue and the cost of the transition package would outweigh savings from no longer paying grants to VicForests, the state-owned timber business.\nBut across the decade it found the money saved from no longer keeping VicForests afloat would be far greater than forestry revenue. The officials calculated it would be expected to improve the state budget position by $191.9m by 2029-2030.\nIndustry representatives and the state Liberal opposition said the PBO analysis was flawed as it did not include the cost of breaking timber supply contracts or redundancy packages for VicForests staff. They said it also did not consider the flow-on economic importance of VicForests\u2019 funding for timber industries, particularly in regional communities, where thousands of jobs were at risk.\nThe Victorian Greens\u2019 environment spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, said the PBO assessment was independent and showed the \u201chuge cost to the public of destructive logging\u201d. She said the money saved by stopping logging could be spent helping regional economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSandell said given the devastating summer bushfires had pushed many animals and plants towards extinction, it was \u201ccriminal\u201d the federal and state governments last week signed a 10-year extension to the regional forestry agreements covering logging in the state. \u201cEnding native forest logging now, rather than in 10 years, will help both the environment and the economy,\u201d she said.\nVictoria\u2019s agriculture minister, Jaclyn Symes, said ending logging immediately would put \u201cthousands\u201d out of work before jobs were available in other forms of forest product manufacturing. She said the government\u2019s policy would help businesses and workers move into jobs based on plantation timber as it became available later in the decade.\nThe PBO analysis was commissioned after the premier, Dan Andrews, announced in November that the native forestry industry would be phased out over the next decade, starting with the immediate protection of 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest and 96,000 hectares of native forest set aside to save the threatened greater glider. Andrews warned the native timber supply was already down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire such as that experienced over the summer that followed might hasten the industry\u2019s end, but said forest supply agreements would be extended to 2024, when the $120m package would start rolling out.\nBushfires burned at least 1.4m hectares in Victoria over summer. According to government assessments, they affected about 70% of the state\u2019s remaining warm temperate rainforest and more than half the habitat of at least 170 rare and threatened species. The extent of the damage prompted calls for more forest to be protected from logging to give at-risk species a better chance of survival.\nThe government plan was based in part on its expectation an extra 50,000 hectares of plantation forest would become available by 2030. Part of the industry package is earmarked to help mills invest in new equipment to process plantation timber.\nThe Victorian Association of Forestry Industries, which opposes ending native forest logging, said the PBO had underestimated the true cost and not taken into account the economic activity that resulted from grants to VicForests.\nIt cited a 2017 Deloitte Access Economics report, commissioned by VicForests, which suggested the industry then supported 2,526 jobs. A University of Canberra analysis for Forests and Wood Products Australia the following year said there were 1,639 primary processing jobs in native forestry and 2,894 in softwood and hardwood plantations.\nJonathon Duniam, the Morrison government\u2019s assistant minister for forestry, said the value of the native forestry industry was in the jobs and livelihoods it provided. \u201cCommunities and our economy are stronger when people are in work,\u201d he said.\nGary Blackwood, the state opposition forestry spokesman, said the PBO\u2019s report was \u201cabsolutely flawed in every sense\u201d. He said it did not appear to include the cost to the state of paying out supply contracts to sawmills, harvest and haul businesses and Australian Paper, and did not consider the impact of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity in the state.\n\u201cBy putting out a report like this the Parliamentary Budget Office [has] insulted every hard-working timber family in Victoria,\u201d Blackwood said.",

        "content": "Official adviser says UK could end up with highest number of coronavirus fatalities in Europe\nThe government has been warned that Britain risks having the highest death toll from coronavirus in Europe as the total number of fatalities from the disease in UK hospitals rose above 10,000.As Boris Johnson left hospital on Sunday, criticism of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic was mounting from senior medics and politicians, particularly over its failure to get enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing to NHS and care home workers.\nProf Sir Jeremy Farrar, an adviser to the government and director of the Wellcome Trust, said the figures of almost 1,000 daily hospital deaths showed the UK was in a similar situation to other European countries that had been badly affected.\n\u201cNumbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope that we are coming close to the numbers reducing. But yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show.\nIn a video message in which he stated optimism and gave thanks for his care, the prime minister attempted to reassure the nation that the UK was \u201cmaking progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus\u201d.\nHe said the NHS had \u201csaved my life, no question\u201d and praised two nurses in particular \u2013 \u201cLuis from Portugal and Jenny from New Zealand\u201d \u2013 for watching over his bedside in intensive care for 48 hours \u201cwhen things could have gone either way\u201d.\nThe total number of hospital deaths stood at 10,612 on Sunday, up by 737 from 9,875 the day before. On Friday and Saturday, the death toll rose by more than 900 each day.\nEpidemiologists and public health experts are divided over how effective the government\u2019s response has been but criticism has been increasing in recent weeks as the UK death toll rises.\nSue Hill, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said she believed UK deaths could rise to 30,000. She acknowledged that the government has a difficult job but said it gave the appearance of placing \u201cpolitical spin\u201d over action.\nDescribing the daily Downing Street briefing as \u201ca bit of a joke\u201d, she said: \u201cHe [Boris Johnson or another cabinet minister] is sitting there speaking about subjects he doesn\u2019t really understand and can\u2019t answer questions about it. It\u2019s political spin, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re not doing themselves any favours.\n\u201cThe thing that irritates me is cabinet ministers are standing up every day, addressing us as if we\u2019re on a war footing and giving Churchillian quotes when they could be doing a few simple things like getting more bits of plastic and paper [which personal protective equipment is made out of] on to wards.\u201d\nProf John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England, who has previously criticised the government over the crisis, said its performance had worsened.\nHe said: \u201cIt was the failure to convene [the emergency committee] Cobra at the beginning of February that meant everything else flowed from it, the failure to order equipment etc. Now we are into the cover-up. Any journalist worth their salt should boycott this propaganda [the daily briefing]. They don\u2019t answer any questions.\n\u201cThe chief nurse deflected the question about the number of nurses and doctors who died because of confidentiality. She wasn\u2019t being asked about individuals, she was being asked about numbers.\u201d\nHe also said that people were dying in care homes and at home without being tested while some were being sent home to die before they had been tested.\n\u201cThere are probably large numbers of people who are not being counted,\u201d said Ashton.Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said \u201cthe time for excuses has passed\u201d when it came to PPE failures and the deaths of medical and care staff.\n\u201cMinisters have been saying for weeks that the PPE situation is in hand. That there\u2019s enough to go around and it\u2019s just a matter of logistics. But it isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNHS, care and other key workers are falling ill in huge numbers. Some have already died \u2013 including nurses, doctors, care workers, healthcare assistants and porters.\u201d\nUnison said its PPE alert hotline has been told of care workers being told to wash their face masks for reuse, threatened with the sack for using them, having to buy their own stock and having to use watered down handwash.\nLabour has tried to strike a constructive tone when criticising the government, but Sir Keir Starmer warned of a \u201cmismatch\u201d between the complaints of medical and care staff that they lack protective equipment and ministers insisting there is enough to go round. The new Labour leader is also expected to press the government this week on gaps in the UK\u2019s financial support schemes for workers and businesses.\nAndy Burnham, Labour\u2019s last health secretary, said: \u201cThe issue is not whether mistakes will be made, the question is how quickly do you acknowledge them and correct them. I think on certain issues they have done that but on what\u2019s most material \u2013 PPE - they haven\u2019t.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Labour backbenchers were breaking rank with the leadership, with Barry Sheerman, the Huddersfield MP, saying the government had \u201cfailed abysmally\u201d to protect NHS staff.\nHe had, he said, tried his \u201chardest to be fair to the government \u2026 but mounting evidence of the sheer incompetence of ministers and the grim fact of 10,000 deaths means now the gloves are off\u201d.\nPeter Hain, the Labour peer and former cabinet minister, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s becoming crystal clear the government has shamefully abandoned frontline health and care workers to their Covid-19 fate as they battle to save the desperately ill.\u201d\nThe opposition has called for immediate talks on the return of a virtual parliament. But with the Commons not due to be recalled until 21 April, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the senior Tory MP and chair of the liaison committee scrutinising the government, called for ministers to agree to a hearing this week.\nWriting for the Guardian, he said: \u201cProper, considered, penetrating, constructive scrutiny does really matter. This is not about hauling ministers before MPs to blame them for the problems they cannot instantly resolve.\n\u201cFormer cabinet secretary Gus O\u2019Donnell should be commended for his searing honesty when he recently admitted, without prompting, that he should have advised previous governments to commit far more resources to flu pandemic planning.\n\u201cThis crisis calls for the same candour and transparency \u2013 that is what speeds up the learning process, leading to better decisions and more effective action.\u201d\nSpeaking at No 10\u2019s briefing on Sunday, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted that both more testing and PPE were on their way to the care sector but he could not give a timescale for when either problem would be sorted out, saying it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to say when the right kit would be in the right place across 58,000 sites.\nAdmitting the death figures meant it was a \u201csombre day\u201d for the UK, he also could not give an update on the number of NHS staff who have died, saying the last previous figure was 19. Statements from hospitals and the families of workers show the figure is more than 30.The usefulness of figures provided by the government in tracking the spread of the virus have also been called into question, with concerns about the lack of tracking of cases \u2013 and deaths \u2013 outside hospitals.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association\u2019s council chair, said with testing only going on in hospitals, it was difficult to draw any conclusions from the government statistics.",

        "content": "Saudi Arabia and Russia reach truce after collapse in demand caused by coronavirus\nThe world\u2019s largest oil producers have agreed a historic deal to cut global oil production by almost 10% to protect the market against the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nMembers of the Opec oil cartel and its allies have agreed to withhold almost 10m barrels a day from next month after the outbreak of Covid-19 wiped out demand for fossil fuels and triggered a collapse in global oil prices.\nThe biggest oil production deal in history is double the size of the cuts agreed following the global financial crisis and marks a truce in the oil price war brewing between Saudi Arabia, Opec\u2019s de facto leader, and Russia.\nThe alliance, known as Opec+, agreed to the production cuts after more than a week of tense talks between the world\u2019s biggest oil-producing nations to shore up the battered global oil market.\nOpec+ has also called in help from major oil producers outside the alliance \u2013 including Brazil, Canada, Norway and the US \u2013 which could double the size of the unprecedented deal to 20m barrels a day.\nThe planned cooperation agreement comes just weeks after Riyadh and Moscow vowed to pump record crude volumes, despite the economic slowdown triggered by Covid-19, in a bid to claim a bigger share of the market.\nThe oil price plunged to 18-year lows of less than $28 (\u00a323) a barrel as fears of a global economic recession and severe restrictions on road transport and aviation caused oil demand to fall by an average of 27m barrels a day in April.\nDonald Trump, the US president, tweeted his thanks to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia for the \u201cbig oil deal\u201d, which would save \u201chundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States\u201d.\nThe US expects its oil production to fall this year because of a slump in the shale industry, which requires higher oil prices than many other oil-producing sectors do. Oil rigs have already begun to close in some landlocked areas of the US after market prices fell below the cost of transporting the barrels to buyers, cutting almost 1m barrels a day from US production.\nIraq\u2019s oil minister welcomed the deal, saying it would help lower oil inventories and boost prices. Canada \u2013 the world\u2019s fourth largest oil producer \u2013 also welcomed the deal, saying it was committed to achieving price certainty and economic stability.\n\u201cThis is good. We welcome any news that brings stability to global oil markets,\u201d Natural Resources Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan said.\nOil prices climbed to $31 a barrel in response to the deal, but industry experts have cast doubt over whether Opec+ alone can do enough to stem the oversupply of oil in the market, and have warned that the deal will emerge too late to buoy the global oil markets.\nPer Magnus Nysveen of Rystad Energy, a Norwegian business analysis firm, said the deal \u201cis at least a temporary relief for the energy industry and for the global economy\u201d and that \u201cthe worst is for now avoided\u201d. But he warned that the production cuts are smaller than what was needed by the market and only postpones the world\u2019s growing oil oversupply problem.\nOver the longer term, the deal may help the oil market to recover from the impact of the pandemic, which is expected to cause demand to fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day over the year as a whole.",

Mississippi governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency after saying several tornadoes had struck the state.\nIn northern Louisiana, up to 300 homes and other buildings were damaged. Utility companies reported thousands of power outages.\nThe storm provided a dilemma for public safety officials trying to find a balance between wanting people to stay in lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic and wanting them to leave their homes for shelter if conditions worsened.\nThe American Meteorological Society, however, was unequivocal in its advice.\n\u201cDo not let the virus prevent you from seeking shelter in a tornado,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIf a public tornado shelter is your best available refuge from severe weather, take steps to ensure you follow CDC [federal] guidelines for physical distancing and disease prevention.\u201d\nCommunity shelters, the meteorological society said, should be a last resort.\nThe Louisiana twister touched down in the city of Monroe at lunchtime, where officials posted to Twitter images of damage from a number of locations. Buildings and aircraft at the town\u2019s airport were destroyed and managers closed runways to all air traffic.\nDue to weather conditions and debris removal from the runways, Mayor Jamie Mayo and Monroe Regional Airport Director Ron Phillips announce \u201call flights at the Monroe Regional Airport are cancelled until further notice.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Kw4zWNRtZT\nThere were reports of damage in Kingston, Louisiana, 120 miles to the east, while local media said at least two tornadoes touched down in central Texas.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued tornado watches and warnings for several states across the south, including Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, as the storm continued to march east.\nSevere weather warnings including flood watches were in place for parts of Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, the Carolinas and as far north as Tennessee. In all, up to 20 states could see some effects, weather experts warned\n\u201cStay safe and weather alert \u2013 it is a dangerous day in Mississippi,\u201d Reeves said in a series of tweets. \u201cPlease take today\u2019s severe storms very seriously. Please take precautions to keep your family safe. We are working and watching closely. Stay safe.\u201d\nMeteorologists said up to 95 million people could be affected by the massive storm through Sunday night and into Monday, with hailstones the size of tennis balls possible in places.\n\u201cThe severe weather threat currently over Mississippi will shift east into Alabama later this afternoon,\u201d the NWS storm prediction centre said in a bulletin issued at 2.45pm ET.\nThe storm, it said, was \u201clikely to strengthen further as it moves into Alabama\u201d, bringing more tornadoes, winds up to 70mph and heavy rains leading to flooding.\nIn a live broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, the NWS office in Jackson, Mississippi, told residents in some areas to seek immediate shelter as it confirmed a tornado on the ground in the state. It was not immediately clear if that touchdown had caused any damage.\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.",

        "content": "After the devastating earthquake just months previously, there seemed to be something on Japan\u2019s side that night in Frankfurt\nOn 11 March 2011, Japan was hit by the fourth most powerful earthquake in recorded history. Almost 16,000 people died, many in the tsunami that devastated the north-east of the country afterwards. The footage was memorable: that eerie black water slowly fanning out across entire towns. Fishing trawlers floating past office buildings. Cars and buses lifted from the road and turned over, as if by a child\u2019s hand. Houses gently carried off into the sea.\nThose images were used during my undergraduate degree to teach us about what philosopher Immanuel Kant called \u201cthe sublime\u201d: a feeling of being so overwhelmed by the size or power of something \u2013 particularly a natural event \u2013 that it inspires a feeling of awe.\nAnd they were the images used just four months later by Norio Sasaki, the head coach of Japan\u2019s women\u2019s national team, to inspire them to complete the most remarkable run of any Asian nation in World Cup history. Before each game in Germany, Sasaki would play the grainy footage to his players; a reminder that their efforts had significance beyond the borders of the sport.\nJapan had never made it out of a group stage before and nobody expected them to do it now. They\u2019d stumbled into 2011 after a poor showing in the Asian Cup, but two wins against New Zealand and Mexico put them on course for their first quarter-final. Their luck seemed to run out when they were drawn against the hosts.\nBut there was a sense of destiny, almost a cosmic apology, to that game. After a tense 90 minutes, it was Karina Maruyama \u2013 one of two players who had worked at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant before the meltdown \u2013 who scored the winner. A semi-final against 2003 runners-up Sweden was next and, again, Japan progressed thanks to a Sweden own goal and two Hedvig Lindahl errors. Something, you felt, was on their side.\nThat something, for me, was epitomised by Homare Sawa. 2011 was Sawa\u2019s fifth World Cup, tied with Brazil\u2019s Formiga for most appearances ever \u2013 though you wouldn\u2019t know it from the amount of ground she covered. She wore the armband at the age of 32, and in a foreshadowing of Megan Rapinoe in 2019, went on to win the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball. Like Rapinoe, it had as much to do with what was happening off the field as what was happening on it.\nThe final in Frankfurt was where it all crystallised. The USA were powerhouses of the women\u2019s game and many thought they\u2019d sail to the title. But as goalkeeper Hope Solo said afterwards: \u201cI truly believe that something bigger was pulling for [Japan].\u201d The Americans charged out from the opening whistle: Lauren Cheney\u2019s strike was swept aside within 30 seconds. Heather O\u2019Reilly wreaked havoc down the right, Rapinoe down the left. Abby Wambach hit the crossbar. But Japan stood firm, a break-wall against those thunderous waves.\nIt took a young Alex Morgan to open the scoring: a galloping counter in behind. But another moment of fortune drew Japan level, a panicked clearance finding Aya Miyama in the six-yard box instead to make it 1-1.\nMomentum was in Japan\u2019s favour as extra-time began. Just before the interval, the USA took the lead. Morgan danced to the by-line and fizzed a cross into Wambach. Header. Goal. Exhaustion. Elation. And a likely game-winner.\nBut Japan, whose resilience was forged in something greater than football, fought on. And with six minutes left, Homare Sawa scored that goal. Against this force of nature that was the US women\u2019s national team, the 5ft 5in midfielder struck, redirecting a corner kick with a flick of her heel. It was miraculous. It was sublime. My awe then was not like Kant\u2019s, though: it wasn\u2019t directed at the wave, but rather towards the woman who never gave up in the face of it.\nThe US would lose the resulting shootout 3-1, bringing the World Cup to Asia for the first time. And Japan\u2019s women\u2019s team became to their devastated nation what Sawa became to me: a symbol of perseverance and heart \u2013 a triumph of hope against all the odds.",

But as Spain\u2019snear-total lockdown stretches beyond Easter, Ana Viladomiu has found herself weeks into living a near-solitary life in one of Barcelona\u2019s top tourist attractions.\nFor more than 30 years, Viladomiu has lived in La Pedrera, a modernist jewel built more than a century ago by famed architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. The passing decades saw almost all the other tenants move out, supplanted by ever growing throngs of visitors lured by the building\u2019s rippling stone facade and knotted balconies.\nTours of the Unesco world heritage site came to a grinding halt last month as Spain began battling one of the world\u2019s deadliest coronavirus epidemics. \u201cLa Pedrera closed its doors and I stayed inside, like a guardian,\u201d said Viladomiu. \u201cAll I hear is my footsteps and silence.\u201d\nTwo other tenants remain in another part of the building \u2013 separated from Viladomiu with their own elevator and staircase \u2013 while a few security guards rotate through their shifts unseen. \u201cSo I\u2019m really by myself,\u201d she said.\nHer unusual status as a tenant in a tourist attraction came to light last year after she published a book, The Last Neighbour, weaving together the history of the building with her experience of living on the fourth floor of an attraction that received some 1.3 million visitors last year.\nThe book hinted at the trade-offs of a life within the curved surfaces that echo Gaudi\u2019s unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica; from elbowing her way through crowds to get to her front door to the many who peer into her apartment as they tour the site.\nLike much of Spain, however, the building has been transformed in recent weeks by the pandemic. \u201cWhat surprised me the most is the silence,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt alone living here, this building is always bustling. Now there is nobody.\u201d\nThe quiet has its advantages, she noted, such as the freedom to take out the rubbish in pyjamas. \u201cThere\u2019s usually so many people. I would never dare take the elevator in a nightgown,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cNow I\u2019ve been wandering around here freely. I\u2019m liking that a lot.\u201d\nShe has taken comfort in the building\u2019s cast iron pillars, bright airy courtyards and sculptural nods to nature. \u201cI\u2019m really privileged to be surrounded by art and beauty,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these tough moments, they help lift the spirit.\u201d\nAmid signs that the outbreak in Spain is slowing, the government has said it is studying how it might gradually ease the near-total lockdown. But Viladomiu said she was doubtful her solitary status would end anytime soon.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting more and more used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be shocking is that first day when they open the doors and people start pouring in. I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Madre mia, what is happening?\u2019\u201d",

Most businesses in Tehran are not due to reopen formally until 18 April, but travel has already intensified, leading to a build-up of traffic.\nSurveys cited by the government showed that a third of people are experiencing financial problems.\nAli Rabiei, Rouhani\u2019s spokesman, told the Isna news agency that the Covid-19 crisis had affected 3.3 million official employees through dismissal, suspension or reduction of wages, with a further 4 million self-employed also feeling its impact.\nIn common with most world leaders, Rouhani is wrestling with the competing needs of collapsing living standards and public health. Iranian officials describe it as a dual policy of \u201csaving lives and providing bread\u201d.\nHe is also operating against a backdrop of US economic sanctions and public scepticism about official government statistics on the spread of coronavirus. Schools, religious services, mass gatherings and many shops remain closed and Rouhani has said if the position did not improve he expected the existing closures to remain in place through Ramadan.\nHe urged people to use private cars after there were crowded buses on the first day of the relaxed rules on Saturday. The metro has called for \u201csmart distancing\u201d, although what this means in practice is not clear.\nIran\u2019s medical system organisation expressed concern, saying smart distancing \u201cwas being introduced without considering the scientific and executive justifications for the project, or the threat that the past efforts of all people, officials and medical staff will be wasted\u201d.\nThe Tehran city council chairman, warned the reopening of business might lead to \u201ca second wave of coronavirus\u201d.\nAli Maher, the planning deputy of the Tehran coronavirus taskforce, said the Rouhani government has been shifting between two different approaches against the spread of the virus, one of mass immunity and the other of implementing lockdowns and quarantines.\nThe signs of pressure on the government are growing. In an unprecedented step, union leaders have refused to back a proposed 21% increase in the minimum wage \u2013 well below the current 40% inflation rate.\nMinisters are offering individual loans to those suffering most, but even that help is being criticised, as the monthly repayment instalments will attract 12% interest.\nNewspapers have also been dealt a heavy blow, with the government proposing to ban all but online newspapers temporarily on the basis paper might transmit infection. The plan, subsequently withdrawn, led to warnings of mass permanent newspaper closures. Redundancies, including in prestigious reformist newspapers such as Etemad, have gone ahead.\nTragedies, including the death of three generations of men in one family, are being publicised in a bid to underline the seriousness of the crisis. A mother and son were reported to have committed suicide after the father died.\nThere are also growing reports of domestic violence, with one Tehran counselling service saying it had taken 4,000 calls in the last few days. Children stuck at home without education do not have the money to afford the internet required to download lessons.\nThe health ministry\u2019s latest statistics on Sunday showed a continued de-escalation of coronavirus cases, with 4,474 now dead and 71,686 infected. The government is pointing to successive falls in the daily numbers of those dying and infected.\nFigures on Sunday showed 117 had died in the previous 24 hours. The number of newly infected was 1,657, down from 2,875 11 days ago. The figures have prompted Rouhani to boast Iran has responded better to the crisis than Europe.",

        "content": "As pandemic spreads rival powers deploy soft power and aid to advance foreign policy goals\nFirst, the Chinese came to Belgrade, with planeloads of equipment and six medical experts to help coordinate national coronavirus policy. An emotional Serbian president kissed the Chinese flag in gratitude and slammed Europe for its lack of assistance.\nThen came the Russians, who flew in less crucial but nevertheless welcome resources on military jets with much media fanfare.\nFinally the Europeans came, pointing out that they had been there all along and had funded significantly more than Russia and China put together.\nIn Serbia, a candidate country for eventual EU accession that has also courted Moscow and Beijing in recent years, the intersection of competing \u201ccoronavirus diplomacies\u201d is highly visible.\nAs the pandemic gathers speed, major players are looking to use soft power and aid to fulfil their foreign policy goals. For the EU, it\u2019s trying to prove that talk of European values and solidarity is not just empty words. For China, it\u2019s changing the narrative to present the country as the solution to coronavirus, not its cause. For Russia, it\u2019s using more modest resources for maximum effect, with Russian military vehicles driving through Italy or a planeload of equipment despatched to the US partly produced by a sanctioned company. The Americans, focused internally under the Trump administration, have largely been absent from the coronavirus diplomacy game.\nIn Serbia, it all started on 15 March, the day president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 declared a state of emergency. It was the same day that a statement from European commission president Ursula von der Leyen appeared to suggest a ban on exporting medical supplies from the bloc. This infuriated Vu\u010di\u0107 and led to an emotional outburst.\n\u201cEuropean solidarity does not exist. It was a fairy tale. I have sent a special letter to the only ones who can help. That is China,\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 told the nation. He asked China for supplies, equipment and advice on fighting the pandemic, and soon after, a plane landed in Belgrade.\n\u201cIt was not exactly what we would want to hear from a government that claims it is doing its utmost to join the EU,\u201d said one European diplomat based in Belgrade. But even in Spain and Italy there has been anger at the lack of a coordinated European response to coronavirus, and for those outside the bloc like Serbia, the rejection was felt even more strongly.\n\u201cThe EU was initially a bit slow and clumsy. This is what happens very often with the EU, of course it cannot be as fast and interventionist in the way China or Russia can be,\u201d said Milena Lazarevi\u0107 of the European Policy Centre in Belgrade.\nChina was happy to step into the gap. Serbian officials say the Chinese experts, who have remained in the country, are now running the government\u2019s coronavirus policy. Unlike most of Europe, Serbia is following the Chinese model of isolating even mild cases of coronavirus in large field hospitals, rather than trusting people to self-isolate.\nThe Chinese also recommended an absolute lockdown such as the one that had been implemented in Wuhan, said one Serbian official. This was rejected on the basis that the Serbian public would not accept it, but strict curfews have been put in place, and those over 70 are confined to their homes at all times.\nA promised mass-testing regime is not yet up to speed and reports suggest the testing procedure is chaotic. But Serbian officials are hopeful that implementing the strict Chinese measures early will mean the country avoids a large-scale epidemic as seen in western European countries. As of Sunday, Serbia has 3,380 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 74 deaths.\nRussia also sent aid, mainly disinfectant solution for hospitals and apartment block entrances. Back in Moscow, opposition figures have griped that the Kremlin has been sending equipment abroad for propaganda gain, while doctors at home lack basic supplies. In Serbia, the help was welcome, though there was a sense that the fanfare around the deliveries may outweigh their actual use.\nSince Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s outburst, the EU has also been working hard to showcase the ways in which it has helped Serbia. The EU delegation in the country noted that more than \u20ac200m (\u00a3176m) of grants and \u20ac250m of loans have been provided to help build and equip medical facilities over the past two decades. An EU-funded laboratory, initially designed to do quality control tests for milk and other food products, has been repurposed as a coronavirus testing lab. A further \u20ac93m of funds has been pledged by the EU over the short and medium term to fight coronavirus and its effects.\nThe coronavirus situation is in many ways an extension of the previous battle for hearts and minds in the Serbia. A survey carried out last December showed that many Serbs believed Russia or China to be the country\u2019s largest donor over the past two decades, while in fact the EU had given about 100 times more than either.\n\u201cIn times of crisis, a plane with emergency materials may have a big public effect but the structural work in the health sector for many years is easily forgotten,\u201d said the European diplomat.\nVu\u010di\u0107 has since also praised European aid, but the big Chinese gestures are likely to stick in the public memory. The prime minister, Ana Brnabi\u0107, has said she wants to build a monument to Serbian-Chinese friendship when the pandemic is over, while a billboard in Belgrade, paid for by a pro-government tabloid, has a simple message: \u201cThank you, Brother Xi.\u201d",

When confined by walls, fences, buildings, when confounded by civilisation, look up and feel your heart lift.\nThe other day I looked up and saw an air ambulance in descent overhead, sunlit and cowslip-yellow, its downdraughts hammering the roofs of our mill town. I held my binoculars on it for a while \u2013 then noticed, beyond it, like a tiny smut on the lens, a buzzard, working a wide curve on the brink of sight.\nOur house has no garden, but it came with a lot of sky. Usually the regulars have it to themselves \u2013 black-headed gulls elbow languidly along, pigeons perform cryptic soap operas of flight, antsy jackdaws always seem to need to be somewhere else \u2013 but every now and then we have sparrowhawks, too. Kestrels nest at the foot of the disused mill chimney. Once or twice, a peregrine has sailed in, all burly charisma, show-offy strut. And buzzards \u2013 more than ever, this spring.\nToday\u2019s buzzard is as low in the sky as I\u2019ve seen one here. I\u2019m out on my walk. I wasn\u2019t looking up until it drifted into my periphery; now I am. I can make out its long-fingered wings and tightly ruddering tail, its maculate underside. As common as anything, these days, buzzards \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere they\u2019re not in Britain \u2013 but a big raptor, up close, will always stop you in the street. This one rides its winding thermal across the double track of a plane\u2019s contrail.\nMost of the buzzards I see here come drifting in from the north, over the brink of the great gritstone hummock that separates us from the Wharfe valley. They nose their way warily into our airspace, mentally mapping out the cricket fields, football pitches, wooded parkland below. They are insistently territorial, so I suppose they reckon that in, too \u2013 this is mine now, this is mine now, and this, and this\u2026\nToday\u2019s seems quite at home just a cherrypicker\u2019s height above our sandstone gables. It\u2019s silly, but at this time of human withdrawal I can\u2019t help wondering if the birds are growing bolder. Later, I watch a magpie stroll slowly across a neighbour\u2019s shed roof. Not a worry in the world.",

        "content": "Top hospital boss says frankness is only way to help service, even if opponents \u2018weaponise\u2019 admission\nMinisters must admit when the NHS is heading for shortages of personal protective equipment for staff, even if opponents \u201cweaponise\u201d such openness, an influential hospital boss is urging.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, wants the government to start alerting health service trusts when they are about to face a lack of equipment such as the ongoing dearth of gowns and visors that frontline staff need to repel Covid-19.\nWriting for the Guardian about PPE shortages, Hopson says: \u201cNational NHS leaders will continue their massive efforts to fill current PPE gaps. But trust leaders believe that they should be included earlier in helping to find the solutions. For example, if there is going to be a stock shortage of a particular item, then far better to know about it well in advance.\n\u201cTrusts then have more time to effect the solutions like the mutual support approach they\u2019ve adopted for gowns over the last few days.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a risk to sharing potentially difficult information more widely, especially if it reaches the public domain and can be weaponised to attack. But fully enlisting the skill, commitment and ingenuity of trusts to solve PPE challenges is key. And then all those who want the NHS to succeed can join together in ensuring this happens.\u201d\nHopson believes that any future public inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will have to look into PPE shortages, which have triggered huge anxiety, alarm and fear among doctors and nurses.\n\u201cWe know the time will come for a public inquiry into the UK\u2019s response to coronavirus, including the issue of PPE. That will explore questions around whether we as a country should have been better prepared.\n\u201cWas the UK as prepared as it should have been for coronavirus including holding the right levels of the right PPE equipment? It will be vital, when the time is right, to explore this question and learn lessons for the future.\u201d\nHopson\u2019s remarks come hours after he revealed on Sunday that the efforts to get adequate supplies of adequate PPE delivered to settings offering NHS care such as hospitals and GP surgeries had \u201call been a bit hand to mouth\u201d.\nHe also disclosed that getting regular supplies of PPE from China, the world\u2019s main manufacturer, had become \u201cerratic\u201d, with some boxes of gowns turning up in the NHS UK found to be full of face masks instead.\nWhile ministers are right that record numbers of pieces of PPE are reaching hospitals and other settings, \u201cfrontline staff, and those representing them, are pointing with increasing frustration to multiple instances of PPE not being available when required\u201d.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, admitted at Sunday\u2019s daily government press conference on coronavirus that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to say when hospitals would have all the PPE they needed.\nThe Royal College of Nursing increased the pressure on ministers over PPE on Sunday when it said that nurses should refuse to treat patients with Covid-19 \u201cas a last resort\u201d if there could not access the full PPE they needed.",

        "content": "I often thought I would lose my mind from being entombed and cut off from the world, but then something happened \nI\u2019ve been watching the rain outside my bedroom window for several hours. An eerie, familiar feeling haunts me as I observe the outside world from inside four walls. It\u2019s starting to feel like this room is all I\u2019ve ever known. I feel disoriented, like I\u2019m still in prison. I sip my coffee and steady my thoughts.\nI\u2019m a 41-year-old woman who has spent almost half her life incarcerated. I sometimes fear there\u2019s nothing meaningful I can contribute to society, but with a global pandemic forcing much of the world into lockdown, I have an unexpected opportunity: to share the lessons from my prison experience that might help others to adjust.\nWhen I was released, I unknowingly walked right into another lockup. Parole mandated that I wear a GPS ankle monitor for the first year of my so-called freedom. I would have to make weekly schedules and would only be permitted to go to locations approved for the day. Approved locations consisted of work, church, medical appointments, the grocery store, the bank, the post office and gas station. Essential daily living needs only. At least living under house arrest and two 10-year stints in prison prophetically prepared me for worldwide lockdown.\nStay-at-home orders from world governments range in severity but more than a third of the human population is under some type of lockdown or restriction. Some people might wonder whether I find it irritating that people call this house arrest. I don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter how either of us got here or what you call it, it\u2019s painfully difficult just the same.\nIn prison, I found myself believing that walls were all that existed. They stood unsympathetic to my suffering and closed in a little bit more each day. I simply refused to make peace with them. I resisted, pounding and screaming into their flat, cold, cement faces. I often thought that I would lose my mind from the feeling of slowly being entombed and cut off from the world, but then something happened.\nAs the outside world disappeared, a new one took shape. The inner world within myself surfaced, as if it had always been waiting to do so. The most important lesson I learned during this time was that I had to accept my circumstances as they were, then change my perspective about them. To my surprise when I did this, those once menacing walls, with their obscene graffiti and chipped paint, transformed. They were no longer holding me hostage but offering refuge.\nRestrictions and stay-at-home orders are the reality, but if we can shift our perspective, our homes become sanctuaries, not prisons. We are not locked in but rather the threat of disease, and hundreds of other harmful things are locked out, distractions and misaligned priorities among them.\nSolitude challenges you to look at things differently. Before prison, my worldview had been rather limited and selfish. I was known to throw terrible tantrums as I tried to bend reality to my will, but peace depended on my bending to reality. Life wasn\u2019t all about me. I had to learn what was within my control and what wasn\u2019t. I also discovered that time exists in relation to an emotion or experience, and it slowed or sped according to my ability to be present. So, I learned how to flow with it, not rushing nor procrastinating, but fully engaged in whatever was before me.\nWhat did that look like? It was as simple as just paying attention. I read books carefully. I listened to others deeply. I stopped mindlessly flipping through the channels of my mind. I gave my full attention to every activity, no matter how small it might be. Full engagement strengthened my gratitude, and gratitude strengthened my will.\nJust a few weeks ago I was told that the parole board had approved the removal of my GPS ankle monitor. After hearing the news, I celebrated by making plans to visit friends in Dallas and Austin. I allowed myself to dream again about better jobs, better places to live and a thriving social life. Freedom was finally within my reach when the walls threatened to close in on me again.\nNow I\u2019m staring out the window and dreading another confinement. Earlier in the week I had spoken to my brother about the unfairness of it all. \u201cWhy is this happening now?! Just when I\u2019m free of the monitor, just when I got my life back together, the whole world goes on lockdown.\u201d He laughed: \u201cBaby sister, the whole world isn\u2019t conspiring against you. A pandemic is not happening just to interrupt your plans.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, life isn\u2019t all about me.\u201d After we hung up, I paced the floor as I often would in my cell. I ran my hands over the walls of my small apartment and knew they would either transform into a prison cell or a refuge. I decided that a refuge sounds nice right about now.",

My flatmate had the symptoms, she had the cough, but she went back to Korea and because everyone going into Korea has to be tested, she got tested and it came back negative.\u201d\nAsked how she thought the UK was faring with coronavirus compared to Korea she said: \u201cThe UK, I\u2019m sorry to say this, is quite bad. I think the important thing is that everyone gets tested.\u201d\n\u201cIn Korea you can walk into a GP surgery and get tested. You don\u2019t need to make an appointment and there is a supply of masks for everyone. It\u2019s just an everyday thing.\u201d\nAkeim Ansine, 22, Amazon worker\nOn his way to work for Amazon at its Park Royal delivery warehouse, Akeim is helping keep the nation in toilet roll.\n\u201cWe do same day or next delivery groceries. We used to do the normal things like paper, pens, staplers, just general homeware.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s pasta, toilet paper, oils. Everybody is pretty much overwhelmed,\u201d he said.\nBut in an important message for the nation he says, \u201cthere is an abundance of toilet roll\u201d.\n\u201cPeople should not be worried. Every day, trucks come and deliver five to 10 pallets a day with about 500 to 1,000 packs per pallet.\n\u201cWe sell all of that every single day. It\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d\nAlex, homeless, normally sleeps at Charing Cross station\n\u201cThey\u2019ve closed Charing Cross and they\u2019re putting us all in hotel rooms, but we\u2019re being allocated rooms miles away. How are we supposed to get there when we have no money for the tube? Last night I tried to get on a bus and the bus driver tried to fight me to get off. We are the victims. When we get to the hotels all the rooms are gone, then where are we supposed to go. It\u2019s a joke,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve closed all the public toilets. How are we meant to wash our hands? I just don\u2019t understand. How can they not allocate free transport to us when they can suddenly allocate housing to people, something they\u2019ve never done before.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get enough food. People aren\u2019t going to work so we can\u2019t get money begging. It used to be okay. We used to get fed on the Strand. Over the past 10 years, 500 people got their food there every night and there\u2019s never been any trouble. Now they have police out moving us on. The victims of this are the homeless.\u201d\nFernanda Harwicke, 37, assistant manager, Leon restaurant, South Kensington\nLike many, the Leon restaurant chain, continues to operate but as a supplier of meals to NHS workers and online customers.\n\u201cYesterday we did 368 meals for the hospital nearby [Chelsea and Westminster]. But we are also supplying food to our customers.\n\u201cIn the very first week we turned our restaurant into making meals, it has taken time to adapt but it\u2019s good now and it\u2019s good to help the NHS,\u201d she says.\nThe escalators at Canary Wharf move passengerless to the outside.\nIt is said that more people use this vast cathedral-like station at the heart of Britain\u2019s financial district than Oxford Circus during rush hour.\nBut the grandeur and elegance of Lord Foster\u2019s Docklands tube station is exposed as the hustle and bustle of this station at the heart of Britain\u2019s financial services Docklands district is replaced by an empty, eerie silence.\nEscalators move passengerless. Some trains pass through without a single passenger getting on or off.\nLouis Nicholl, 21, from Norfolk\nLouis is travelling to Southwark for his first day in his new job as a police officer.\n\u201cWhen I was getting the bus from Sidcup I was more afraid. I came here on the DLR and the driver is barriered off and people can be 10 feet apart so it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nRoxy Yang, 28, and Sue Yang, 54\nRoxy works on the beauty counter at Selfridge\u2019s in Oxford Street and was among the first batch of workers to be furloughed.\nShe decided to leave London because her housemate was still working and she felt she might bring the virus home. Her mother, Sue, came down from Manchester to accompany her home.\n\u201cShe was very worried I might catch the virus in London. She\u2019s been asking me to come home every day for more than a week. She\u2019s very relieved and happy that finally we are going home,\u201d says Roxy.\n\u201cThe trains are so empty. It is so different from what it usually is. I\u2019m happy to see that because it means people are staying at home,\u201d she adds.\nCharlie Briars and Varelie Ivalor \nThe couple have just walked from nearby Poplar to get their cash out of Santander bank but the branch isn\u2019t open so they are on their way on the tube network in search of a branch that is.\n\u201cI\u2019m really annoyed, they don\u2019t answer the phone. The website has the wrong information. We need to get our money out,\u201d said Charlie.\nNorthern line platform at Bank.\nA deserted London Bridge concourse.\nLondon Bridge, one of the critical interchanges in the country, with packed commuter trains connecting with the Jubilee and Northern line tube services, is like a ghost town with shops shuttered and empty concourses.\nTiti, 40, support worker, mental health services\nTito is on her way back from Elephant and Castle after a supervisory visit to a residential unit for adults with learning and mental disabilities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard. They don\u2019t understand why they have to stay indoors and they are not very happy about it. They like to go out and about. One of them managed to leave the house and they had to call the police. The problem is when they are out they touch everything because they don\u2019t understand about not touching things or about social distancing, so they can bring the virus home.\n\u201cThe last three weeks have been very stressful. Some of them were crying and on the phone wanting to go. Some have family, some don\u2019t,\u201d she said.\nMargaret\nShe is travelling from Canning Town to Clapham North hoping to pay her last respects to her friend who has died at home, she believes, of bronchitis.\n\u201cI am going to a funeral of a friend. Her husband has just died. He was 73 and had bronchitis. I don\u2019t know if the body is still at home.\u201d\nOnly immediate families are advised to attend funeral services in England, according to government guidance, so it is an especially challenging time for all the bereaved.\n\u201cAt least he died at home and wasn\u2019t in hospital because she wouldn\u2019t have been able to be with him,\u201d she says.\n*Margaret asked for her real name not to be used.\nRicky, 36, security staff\nRicky is on his way to work at an office block and is anxious about travelling on the tube.\n\u201cI follow the distancing rules but when you are on the underground there is more virus because it\u2019s more compact. They gave us gloves and the mask at work. But you notice some sort of crazy people on the tube,\u201d he says as a young adult male, possibly on drugs, bounces erratically around the platform shouting.\nA lone figure at a Bank tunnel, normally crammed with City types working in financial services.\nA discarded begging cup and the Mind the Gap warning at Bank.\nWhitechapel station in east London is the stop for NHS staff working at the Royal London, one of the biggest hospitals in London and home to London\u2019s air ambulance. We visited outside rush hour (due to Tfl restrictions) and the station was near deserted.\nSarah, NHS worker\nSarah commutes from Essex to the Royal London hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in the capital. She works in \u201cbackline\u201d duties in a non-face-to-face job in blood sciences.\nShe was recently redeployed to another department as part of the hospital\u2019s coronavirus response.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to particularly come out and travel on the tube but some of us have got to do this. Coming in, there is only one train an hour and the hard part is connecting with the train on the way back,\u201d she says illustrating how hard travelling to work has become after the reduction of transport services. But she is positive. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve not had to breach the two-metre rule.\u201d\nGiuseppe Casser from Naples\nHe restores antiques but is currently out of work and staying at home. He\u2019s on the tube at Whitechapel where he lives to go to Sloane Square to help an 80-year-old friend who is vulnerable and needs food and cleaning products. \u201cEvery day the tube is full, full, full, but now there are fewer people, it is good.\nAndrea Peter, 25, from Hungary\nAndrea is on her way to work in the dispensary at a branch of Boots in Hyde Park.\n\u201cIn the past two weeks it was a bit scary on the tube. It was quite chaotic in the first few weeks. In the beginning there were a lot more people on the tube. There were lot of homeless people and beggars on almost every train. Now everybody is used to it so it is better.\u201d\nMonument underground station.\nMonument station on the north bank of the Thames is linked to Bank through a warren of underground walkways that connect the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Northern lines and \u201cthe drain\u201d, the nickname for the Waterloo and City line, which is closed during the coronavirus lockdown.\nEmpty train with doors open at Monument underground station.\n This article was amended on 14 and 28 April 2020 to clarify that only immediate families are advised to attend funeral services in England, rather than \u201callowed\u201d to do so as an earlier version said; and to correct the date of the tiling at Piccadilly Circus.",

        "content": "Come on in \u2026 the big blue is lovely in these immersive videos and live streams \u2013 from diving on the Great Barrier Reef to swimming with sharks off Mexico\nExploring the world\u2019s best-known coral environment, on the east coast of Australia, David Attenborough\u2019s Great Barrier Reef is an interactive journey around this \u201cbeautiful but threatened world\u201d. It delves in detail into some of the 1,500 fish species and 600 coral types that live on the 133,000-square-mile reef, to tell the story of one of Earth\u2019s most biodiverse ecosystems and the damage done to it by climate change \u2013 through interactive timelapses, videos, weather maps and even a \u201cmantis shrimp vision\u201d tool. As part of the Netflix documentary Chasing Coral, which investigates coral bleaching around the world, the Ocean Agency has created a series of 360 degree images on Google Earth (click through the tabs bottom left to fly between locations). Also try AirPano,which offers a glimpse of a multicoloured reef near Komodo Island in Indonesia via an interactive photo.\nDuuun dun. Duuun dun. Dun-dun dun-dun dun-dun \u2026 Perhaps nothing will ever beat that film when it comes to galeophobia-inducing experiences, but there are plenty of virtual ways of getting up close, too . The great white can grow up to six metres in length and reach a speed of 35 mph. It gets spine-tinglingly close in this 360 degree video in Guadalupe Island off Mexico\u2019s Baja California, where the viewer sits just outside the cage. Elsewhere, National Geographic has created an immersive video of a face-to-face encounter with a hammerhead shark in the Bahamas. The Discovery Channel captured a whale shark \u2013 the largest fish on the planet- in 360 degrees. And the MythBusters team from the same channel also shot around 30 reef sharks together near the Bahamas\u2019 Ray of Hope shipwreck, as part of a wider research project on sharks\u2019 fears. If you\u2019re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of one on Exploreorg\u2019s webcam stream in the Atlantic off Cape Fear, North Carolina.\nSwim with wild dolphins in a 360-degree video by the Dolphin Swim Club, created as a \u201ccruelty-free alternative for so-called dolphin-assisted therapies with captive dolphins\u201d. The research organisation has also developed waterproof UnderwaterVR goggles, allowing swimmers to experience virtual wild dolphins and associated therapeutic effects. In the Bahamas, the Dolphin Project calls for viewers to take the pledge, during its 360-degree video, not to buy tickets to shows that use captive dolphins. And BBC Earth\u2019s Our Blue Planet VR video series includes an immersive virtual reality experience of bottlenose dolphins and oceanic manta rays. A marine biologist narrates the scene off the coast of Mexico, near San Benedicto island, and although filmed for 3D, it is worth a watch even without a VR headset.\nUnderwater jungles of kelp cover around 25% of the world\u2019s coastlines, and each wide blade of the ribbon-like seaweed can grow up to two feet in a day. Helping to fight climate change, kelp is highly efficient at storing carbon from the atmosphere \u2013 an estimated 600m tonnes a year, around twice as much as the UK emits. Ocean First Education, which provides marine science courses online, has created an immersive video venturing through Anacapa\u2019s kelp forests in California\u2019s Channel Islands national park, which also has its own webcam stream. The nearby Channel Islands national marine sanctuary takes a narrated virtual dive with some playful sea lions. Elsewhere, BBC Earth\u2019s 360 degree footage takes a dip in a Norwegian kelp forest, and another at Monterey Bay, California.\nExploring shipwrecks usually requires a diving qualification, but these interactive virtual tours take viewers into underwater sites without any danger. There are several 360-degree videos of exploration around New Zealand, including the HMNZS Canterbury, a frigate warship, sunk to provide an artificial reef and dive wreck in 2007; and the MS Mikhail Lermontov, an ocean liner. The latter\u2019s central staircase and starboard entrance collapsed after an earthquake in 2016, so this video is now the only way to see these features. Another 360-degree video tour with voiceover narration explores the wreck of the SS Thistlegorm, an armed Merchant Navy ship that was bombed in October 1941 near Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea, and is now a well-known diving site.\nThere is something magical about sea turtles \u2013 they can hold their breath under the water for up to seven hours, the live to around 100 years old, and their favourite meal is jellyfish with seagrass. National Geographic shot this 360-degree video in Buck Island Reef in the US Virgin Islands, one of the first protected marine monuments in the US, created in 1961. It includes a rare glimpse of tiny hatchlings as they head from nest to sea at night. Similarly, this 360-degree footage by the BBC captures a nest on a desert island beach in the Caribbean. An Airpano video captures a larger adult sea turtle off Cuba\u2019s largely uninhabited Jardines de la Reina archipelago in the Caribbean. Almost all species of turtles are now endangered, facing an increasingly difficult battle against a range of threats \u2013 from mistaking plastic for food to poaching and light pollution on the beach.\nRays have the greatest brain-to-size ratio of any fish. The largest is the manta ray, which can grow up to seven metres in length. One of the best places to see them is Indonesia, as seen in this 360 video by AirPano, shot off the coast of Raja Ampat, West Papua, which captures one of the giant aquatic gliders over a reef. The Discovery Channel also caught a close-up immersive video of mantas swimming with whale sharks, and has a marine biologist explaining why anchor species like these are vital to the survival of the oceans. Often confused with manta rays, devil rays are their smaller cousin, with a mouth slightly under the face instead of in front, and pointier \u201chorns\u201d. This 360-degree video takes a dip with a group of them off the coast Santa Maria island in the Azores.\nThey may not have a brain, a heart, bones or eyes, but jellyfish can be deadly. The gelatinous sea creatures have a \u201cnerve net\u201d controlling feeding, swimming and protective actions, and often a set of trailing stinging tentacles \u2013 which in the case of the near-invisible sea wasp, the deadliest jellyfish on Earth, can kill a human with a dose the size of a grain of salt. Capturing the less terrifying, stingless, medusa species, in a lagoon in Raja Ampat in Indonesia, AirPano\u2019s 360-degree video takes viewers in among a vast swarm \u2013 known as a smack of jellyfish. Another hypnotic immersive video shows a singular pulsating translucent blob off Cuba\u2019s Jardines de la Reina.\n\nThe way fish move instinctively in coordinated unison is known as schooling, which is different to shoaling, when fish stick together for social reasons, such as defence, foraging or finding a mate. The shape of the schooling depends on the species - some form rectangles or ovals with back-and-forth swimming; others move in tornado sequences. Showing a variety of formations, this AirPano 360-degree video shows thousands of caranx and other reef fish near Malpelo Island, 300 miles off Colombia\u2019sPacific coast. Another set of still 360-degree images, shot in the New Caledonian barrier reef in the South Pacific \u2013 the longest continuous barrier reef in the world at 930 miles \u2013 shows hundreds more colourful reef varieties (click the white arrows to explore the site). And this spectacular 360-degree footage by the BBC, captures a barracuda tornado off the coast of Sipadan Island, near Borneo, shot during filming for Attenborough\u2019s Blue Planet II.\n\n\nWith a brain in the middle of the body controlling the nervous system, and several million neurons in their eight tentacles (allowing them to touch, taste and move objects independently), octopus are, not surprisingly, highly intelligent animals. They have been seen unscrewing jars, carrying coconut shells as armour and stacking rocks. Try to find the octopus at the start of this 360-degree video by YouTuber Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B \u2013 it is almost completely disguised and continually changes the colour of its skin as it darts around, camouflaging itself against the rocky seabed. A narrated BBC Earth 360-degree diving video (shot for 3D headsets where possible), descends with a dive team at Browning Wall in British Columbia, Canada, passing giant Pacific octopus, a huge wolf eel out hunting, sea lions and starfish.",

There have been more than 114,000 deaths globally. The US has the most confirmed cases at more than 557,000, with 22,108 deaths. In the UK, there are more than 85,000 cases and more than 10,600 deaths.\nMainland China reported 108 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, up from 99 a day earlier and 46 reported on Friday. Chinese authorities are increasing restrictions and monitoring in the northern regions bordering Russia, after a rise in people with Covid-19 crossing the border.\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron is expected to warn on Monday that the country\u2019s lockdown will continue for several more weeks at least. On Sunday, France reported a lower number of Covid-19 fatalities over the past 24 hours, with 315 deaths in hospital over the past day, compared with 345 the previous day.\nSome companies are set to resume operations at the end of a two-week halt of all non-essential activity. Spain\u2019s death toll has fallen over recent days, but as a small bump in deaths was reported on Sunday, the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, warned said: \u201cWe are all keen to go back out on the streets ... but our desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen by 2,537 to 123,016. That was lower than a 2,821 increase reported on Sunday and marked the third decline after four days of increases.\nThe move comes in response to the coronavirus crisis and a Russia-Saudi price war, and with hopes to boost plummeting oil prices. The agreement between the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners foresees deep output cuts in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.\nThe ruling came after efforts in Texas, Ohio, Alabama and other US states to prohibit abortion services during the Covid-19 outbreak. States have argued they need to conserve medical equipment and potential hospital beds during the pandemic and that abortions are elective medical procedures.",

Instead the Foreign Office replied on 31 March, saying the UK would continue to support the implementation of the EU-Turkey deal, which for the past four years has aimed to prevent asylum seekers from travelling to Europe.\nVickie Hawkins, executive director of MSF UK, described the response as \u201cshameful\u201d, arguing that the deal was ostensibly a containment policy and an abandonment of the EU\u2019s responsibilities towards refugees. \u201cThis cynical deal traps thousands of people \u2013 many of them children or deeply vulnerable \u2013 in squalid conditions on the Greek islands,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe UK government must stop sacrificing basic refugee rights for the sake of its migration agenda.\u201d\nHolding facilities on all five Aegean isles, including Moria, the squalid refugee camp on Lesbos, opposite the Turkish coast, are currently six times over capacity. Humanitarian organisations have warned that a coronavirus outbreak in the camps, where social distancing is impossible for many, could prompt a public health emergency.\nThe European parliament\u2019s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee recently urged the evacuation of 42,000 people on the islands as \u201can urgent preventive\u201d measure.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are continuing to process Dublin cases, including children, as far as the current restrictions in place across Europe permit.\n\u201cIt is widely known that arrangements to complete a transfer are the responsibility of the sending state.\n\u201cThis is a fast-changing situation and we, along with EU member states, will be subject to wider decisions from respective governments, including travel restrictions related to coronavirus.\u201d\nIt has also emerged that charities recently asked EU countries to help \u201cdecongest\u201d the Greek island camps ahead of a possible Covid-19 outbreak. Again, the UK government is understood to have refused to offer assistance, with MSF saying that a number of EU countries including Germany, France, Luxembourg, Finland, Belgium and Bulgaria had volunteered to help transfer 2,000 children from the islands.\nAur\u00e9lie Ponthieu, MSF\u2019s forced migration team coordinator, said: \u201cThe UK has so far not volunteered to help the children. These measures are symbolic; if these camps get the virus it\u2019s going to be a disaster. Access to healthcare is very limited.\u201d\nThe legal charity Safe Passage last week sent the Home Office a list of unaccompanied children and vulnerable adult refugees who have been legally accepted for transfer to join family in the UK, but who are now trapped on the Greek islands because of the coronavirus travel chaos.\nBeth Gardiner-Smith, chief executive of Safe Passage International, said: \u201cThe government cannot now sit on its hands. We have a small window of opportunity to evacuate all those unaccompanied children and vulnerable adults who have families here in the UK waiting to receive them now at grave risk in overcrowded and unsanitary camps and settlements.\n\u201cWe know children will be leaving on charter flights to the EU next week, why not to the UK too?\u201d she added.\n This article was amended on 13 April 2020 to include a comment from the Home Office.",

        "content": "Top health experts sign letter saying badly needed medications used in lethal injections \u2018could save the lives of hundreds\u2019\nDeath penalty states in the US are stockpiling medicines for lethal injections that could save the lives of hundreds of coronavirus patients were they released for medical use.\nA group of prominent medical practitioners and experts has issued an appeal to capital punishment states to release their stocks of essential sedatives and paralytics that they hoard for executions. The drugs are among the most sought after in hospital intensive care units around the country where shortages of the key medicines are putting lives of Covid-19 patients at risk.\nA letter, co-signed by seven leading anesthesiologists, pharmacists and medical academics, is being sent out to the corrections departments of all death penalty states. It points out hospitals are facing desperate shortages of sedatives and paralytics used for intubations and mechanical ventilation of the most severely ill coronavirus patients who cannot breathe for themselves.\nThe letter to the directors of state prison departments warns the drug shortages could put even the lives of those departments\u2019 own top officials in peril.\n\u201cYour stockpile could save the lives of hundreds of people \u2026 Those who might be saved could include a colleague, a loved one, or even you,\u201d it warns.\nIt is not known how many states are stockpiling lethal injection drugs, though 19 out of 28 death penalty states in the US have execution protocols that involve the use of sedatives and paralytics. These include midazolam, vecuronium bromide, rocuronium bromide and fentanyl, which are all currently listed by pharmacy organizations as being in short supply in hospitals.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also recorded shortages for midazolam and fentanyl. As a result of the dearth of supplies, doctors are having to ration the use of the drugs that are critical in the process of mechanically ventilating patients on the verge of death from Covid-19.\nThree states \u2013 Florida, Nevada and Tennessee \u2013 have disclosed they are stockpiling large quantities of sedatives and paralytics for executions. Florida alone is hoarding 20,000mg of rocuronium bromide which the medical experts estimate could be used to intubate about 100 Covid-19 patients.\nIn addition, there are many death penalty states that keep their supplies of medical drugs procured for lethal injections hidden under a veil of secrecy. The experts believe these secret supplies could help save the lives of hundreds more Americans.\nJoel Zivot, one of the signatories who is an Emory University anesthesiologist currently caring for critically sick coronavirus patients in intensive care, said the medicines being stockpiled in order to kill death row prisoners were vital in the process of treating severely ill Covid-19 patients.\n\u201cNone of these medicines were designed for executions. Stockpiling drugs intended to save lives in order to kill people was never acceptable, but that is especially the case now when it is actually harming the public in the face of the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Zivot said.\nBlaire Andres of Reprieve, a human rights group that monitors lethal injection procedures, said: \u201cAll of the medicines used in executions are life-saving products and were never designed to cause harm. Healthcare companies have warned that diverting medicines into death row storerooms creates dangerous drug shortages.\u201d",

        "content": "Available onlineMercury Theatre Colchester and St Helens Theatre Royal have both launched online pantomimes for isolated audiences\nI once had to prepare a class of American students for their very first pantomime. The more I talked, the more I lost confidence. I sounded preposterous. What could possibly be appealing about the eccentric mix of fairytale, music hall and folk tradition I was trying to enthuse them with?\nAs it happened, they loved it. Evidently, the joy of panto is beyond words. You just have to be there.\nIn these days of coronavirus lockdown, however, being there is no longer an option. Which is why going online to watch Ryan McBryde\u2019s production of Cinderella (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606) leaves me conflicted.\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s a generous idea to share a show with housebound families for this Easter week \u2013 and a clever way to campaign for funds for the Mercury Theatre Colchester\u2019s \u00a39.8m redevelopment project.\nOn the other hand, watching such an exuberant and interactive form in the solitude of your living room makes you feel oddly detached. It isn\u2019t us shouting out our names to Mari McGinlay\u2019s self-assured Ella when she asks us to introduce ourselves. It isn\u2019t us getting peed on by the Ugly Sisters\u2019 dogs as they carry them around in their handbags. And it isn\u2019t us joining in a competitive bout of Get Me to the Church on Time before the final curtain.\nNone of this is a massive loss, but it\u2019s enough to take the edge off a classy production. Pantomime trades on controlled chaos, something that needs you in the same room as the unfolding anarchy. What must have seemed naughty, rambunctious and funny on stage too often feels tame on screen. As a result, the fairy-story romance between McGinlay\u2019s no-nonsense heroine and Samuel Knight\u2019s Prince Charming comes across best.\nAs pantos go, this Cinderella is at the posher end of the scale. Less the rough-and-ready vigour of the music hall (although Mercury regulars Antony Stuart-Hicks and Dale Superville provide grit as the Ugly Sisters), more the polish of legit actors lending psychological depth to Andrew Pollard\u2019s script. That\u2019s when they\u2019re not being put through their musical-theatre paces on the free-range soundtrack put together by musical director Nick Barstow. In one medley alone they go from Meghan Trainor\u2019s All About That Bass to Rosemary Clooney\u2019s Sisters.\nTicking all the panto boxes, Pollard jazzes things up with a cross-dressing Dandini, going in disguise to improve her work prospects. It adds a touch of Twelfth Night playfulness, works in a spot of feminist commentary and gives an excellent Nerine Skinner the chance to exercise her comedic muscles. That\u2019s in addition to providing an alternative love interest for Nicholas McLean\u2019s Buttons. If we lose the poignancy of seeing him unlucky in love after Ella lands her prince, we gain in the pleasing symmetry of a double romance.\nThis article includes content provided by Facebook.

Rapunzel: The Lockdown Panto (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606), by contrast, is every bit in the here and now. Created by Regal Entertainments and St Helens Theatre Royal, James Lacey\u2019s delightful show turns social distancing into an asset.\nEach cast member has recorded their part at home, so we get Abby Middleton\u2019s spirited Fairy Anna(logue) guiding us through a story that splices together domestic interiors framed by cartoon palaces, towers and cuckoo clocks. With its mix-and-match cameras and simulated audience participation, it marshals a chorus-line of back-garden dancers in matching denim tops and a cast decked out in homemade props (check out the king\u2019s pan-lid crown) to produce a show bursting with panto\u2019s ramshackle spirit.\nAfter a dispute over stolen cabbages, Lacey\u2019s bumptious Witch claims Olivia Sloyan\u2019s Rapunzel as her own and brings her up in lockdown isolation, making sure to maintain her supplies of pasta, paracetamol and loo roll. It\u2019s as daft as it is enthusiastic, cheekily aware of its own topicality even as it keeps a grip on the story\u2019s urgency.\nBroadcast in 10-minute helpings through the week, it is a joyful act of resilience. Oh, yes it is!\nCinderella is available to watch online until 19 April at mercurytheatre.co.uk/cinderella-online; Rapunzel is available at facebook.com/sthelenstheatreroyal.",

        "content": "Despite facing personal hardship, a team of refugees has been delivering food to hospital staff in Malaysia\u2019s capital during the coronavirus outbreak\nIn a small shop-turned-kitchen on the ground floor of a block of flats in Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Jaber, 60, is preparing a feast: 20 portions of bechamel macaroni with minced chicken and lentil soup, accompanied by basbousa, a traditional semolina sweet cake he and his family often ate back in Syria before they fled to Malaysia in 2012.\n\u201cWe have so many desserts in Syria, but Malaysians seem to like basbousa the most,\u201d his 21-year-old son, Tarek Jaber, says.\nCooking is what Mohammad Jaber does. For almost 30 years before war broke out in Syria, he ran a restaurant in Damascus. Since 2013, he has been catering for restaurants and private events out of this small kitchen in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Taman Melati neighbourhood.\nNow though, Mohammad and his assistant Mahmoud Mohammed Salad, a 22-year-old Somalian, are feeding a different community: frontline health workers at the Ampang hospital, a public healthcare facility in the Malaysian capital. They are part of a group of 15 refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan who have joined forces to feed those on the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis. Here, cases have risen above 4,000, and 70 deaths have been recorded.\nThree weeks ago when the Malaysian government imposed a movement control order prohibiting the operation of all but essential services, two advocacy groups, the Syrian Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and Malaysian Beyond Borders Malaysia, put a call out to members of their community to form a refugee kitchen.\nThe response was immediate and overwhelming. \u201cJust on the same day, 10 chefs came forward. We said we had nothing to pay them, but they said they wanted to help,\u201d says Hasan Al-Akraa who founded the Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and launched the refugee kitchen with Malaysian film-maker Mahi Ramakrishnan.\n\u201cIn the end, Mahi and I raised some funds and gave each of them enough for two days of groceries. They have responsibilities and children to feed.\u201d They have now cooked more than 400 meals for nurses and doctors and other frontline staff since they opened their kitchen on 23 March.\nThe first time he took part, Jaber \u2013 who now cooks wearing gloves and a protective face mask \u2013 made mandi chicken with rice, a popular Arabic staple.\n\u201cMy father feels it is his duty to provide services for the people of Malaysia who have been affected by this difficult situation,\u201d Tarek says as his father stirs saucepans in the kitchen.\nThe refugee chefs \u2013 12 women and three men \u2013 start cooking in the morning and have the food ready by 11am. A volunteer or hired driver picks it up and takes it to the health workers at the hospital. Al-Akraa helps to coordinate all this from his room at Nottingham University\u2019s Malaysia campus, or even while out running errands.\nLike Mohammad, Al-Akraa arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Syria in 2012, with his parents and four siblings. When he was 14, while trying to help his family, he was arrested by the Malaysian authorities for working at a restaurant without a permit. Although the Malaysian government works with NGOs to provide some assistance for refugees, it does not recognise them legally, meaning they have limited opportunities to study and work.\nIn detention for nine days, Al-Akraa met three Rohingya refugees who inspired him to start helping others when he was free. \u201cI told myself I shouldn\u2019t be complaining. At least I have a UNHCR refugee card, so I would be released, but they came by boat and didn\u2019t have any documentation.\u201d\nAt the refugee kitchen, the chefs rotate every day, and next on the rota is 43-year-old Elham Jaber Jasim Musawi. She prepares chicken macaroni \u2013 which she often cooks for her kids \u2013 with the help of her husband, Hussam Kadhim Younes Al Mohammedawi. Her 14-year-old son, Danial Husam Kadhim, had helped her with the shopping the day before.\nMusawi left Baghdad with her husband and children in 2014 when Islamic State escalated its attacks in her country. Now they live in a three-bedroom flat in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Ampang neighbourhood. Lockdown has been hard for the family. The children watch TV and play football indoors to pass the time and Musawi is worried that the family won\u2019t be able to pay their rent. Both her job at a local school and that of her husband have been affected by the restrictions on movement.\nStill, she is happy to help. \u201cThis is an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t have passed up for anything. It\u2019s not always that we get a chance to do something meaningful. We are all thankful to the doctors and all other medical workers who sacrifice their lives to keep us safe,\u201d she says.\nThe food is gratefully received by the nurses and doctors.\n\u201cEven though they\u2019re not from our country, they want to help us while we carry out our work,\u201d says Shuhaida Shuib, 42, a nurse at Ampang hospital. \u201cI think that\u2019s very compassionate and it means a lot in these difficult times.\u201d",

        "content": "Figures from Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium suggest UK may be underestimating care sector deaths\nAbout half of all Covid-19 deaths appear to be happening in care homes in some European countries, according to early figures gathered by UK-based academics who are warning that the same effort must be put into fighting the virus in care homes as in the NHS.\nSnapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium between 42% and 57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in homes, according to the report by academics based at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nPublished official data for care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate deaths in the sector, with the Office for National Statistics only recording 20 coronavirus-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March. New figures are due out on Tuesday, but are unlikely to be up to date.\nLast week the industry body Care England told the Guardian the total figure was probably approaching 1,000, with deaths reaching into double figures at numerous homes. Over the weekend details of more deaths emerged, including 13 residents who have died at the 71-capacity Stanley Park care home in County Durham, and there have reportedly been five deaths at Almond Court in Glasgow.\nOn Monday Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said 13.5% of the UK\u2019s care homes had a confirmed case of coronavirus among their residents, up from 9% last week, with 92 more homes detecting cases in the previous 24 hours.\nBut the spread of the virus and its lethality in care homes in five EU countries appears to be higher, according to academics who are calling for better UK data and a more urgent response to the crisis in care homes.\nIn its first review of early international evidence, researchers from the International Long Term Care Policy Network (LTCPN) found the most robust data was available in Ireland where, as of Saturday, 54% of deaths from coronavirus occurred in care homes, according to centralised government figures.\nIn Italy, a government survey covering deaths in 10% of the nations\u2019 care homes suggested 45% of all deaths in that country could be in care homes, while central government data in France released at the weekend showed the same proportion of the 13,832 deaths in that country happened in care. In Belgium, health ministry figures showed 42% of Covid-19 deaths happened in care homes, and in Spain leaked regional government data suggested 57% of the country\u2019s death toll from 8 March to 8 April was from care homes.\nThe figures came from different sources and the academics stressed that differences in testing availability and policies and approaches to recording deaths make international comparisons difficult.\nBut one of the report\u2019s author\u2019s, Adelina Comas-Herrera, of the LSE\u2019s care policy and evaluation centre, said that given the fast-moving situation \u201cwe\u2019re trying to document it as it happens and share it\u201d.\n\u201cIf we wait for perfect standards of evidence it will be too late to make any difference,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTo me it shows we will have to give equal resourcing in dealing with Covid between the NHS and social care. Care homes are places where physical distancing is almost impossible. It\u2019s like a perfect storm: a susceptible population, not being able to implement the measures and the staff are not well supported and trained enough. Many of the staff are care assistants with very little medical knowledge.\u201d\nThere have been three epidemiological studies of Covid-19 in care homes carried out by authorities in Seattle, one of which found that by 18 March, of 101 care home residents who contracted the virus in the preceding weeks, 34 died.\nDr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said the LCTPN\u2019s summary of evidence \u201cclearly shows the lack of focus on the elderly in care homes, despite their conclusion that care home residents may account for around half of Covid deaths in five European countries. Our elderly populations deserve better than to be ignored and forgotten.\u201d\nHe cautioned that it remains hard to draw conclusions on precise numbers of deaths of elderly people in nursing and residential care around Europe and said that given there are few tests available, very few suspects cases will end up as confirmed cases.\nHe said: \u201cDespite these limitations, we know that a range of infections can spread easily in vulnerable populations who live in nursing or residential care, for example norovirus, scabies, influenza, and here, the novel coronavirus.\u201d\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are determined to give the social care sector the support it needs to respond to coronavirus and continue to work closely with Public Health England to monitor the impact on cares homes.\n\u201cWe have published extensive guidance for care homes on admitting and caring for people during the outbreak, and have announced \u00a32.9bn to help local authorities respond to pressures in key services, such as adult social care, and enhance the NHS discharge service, allowing patients to return home safely.\u201d",

        "content": "The Treviso and Italy fly-half, who has fought back from losing sight in one eye to relaunch his career, describes the profound impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on his home town in Italy\n\u201cThe two things that you usually hear are silence and sirens. It\u2019s a haunting sound and it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re in a war,\u201d Ian McKinley says as he begins to explain the impact of the lockdown in Italy which began on 9 March and will now continue for at least another three weeks. McKinley, the Irish rugby player who lost the sight in his left eye when he was raked at the bottom of a ruck in Dublin in 2010, understands adversity.\nThe 30-year-old also understands better than most how you come back from uncertain times. Having been forced into retirement he took a chance in 2012 and accepted an offer to do some informal coaching in a small Italian city, Udine, near the Slovenian border. Neither he nor his girlfriend, Cordelia, who is now his wife, could speak any Italian but they adapted. Then, with the help of his brother, McKinley decided to try to play rugby again while wearing specially designed goggles which could protect his eyes. Slowly, but with inspirational determination, McKinley came back to professional rugby \u2013 with such impact that he has played nine Tests for Italy at fly-half.\nMcKinley and his wife now live in Treviso, in northern Italy, close to the area that has been hit so severely by Covid-19. He is engaging and intelligent \u2013 and also a compelling witness to the Italian lockdown. Britain and Ireland are weeks behind Italy, both in terms of facing the worst of the pandemic, and also in coping with such stringent self\u2011isolation. Hearing his calm voice from Treviso, and seeing his wry and wistful expressions on my laptop screen, McKinley is like a guide from the future. Amid the ghostly life he has lived the past six weeks, and the continuing worry, he has found hope and light.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a lockdown for over a month now and thankfully the silence and the sirens have subsided somewhat. It\u2019s become a bit better the past few days. The numbers are going down a little. But it still feels very surreal to have gone from living your life to the fullest, being involved with lots of things, to basically zero. You can only walk around if you have a pet to exercise and so we\u2019re lucky we have a little dog. We\u2019re allowed out once a day to walk the dog and there\u2019s no one around. This little city I live in is not like Dublin or London \u2013 but 70,000 people still live here. And it\u2019s completely dead.\n\u201cYou still need a certificate if you go out. The only other thing you can do is get to the shops for food. Two of you cannot go shopping together. If you\u2019re in a car of two people, the police have every right to pull you over and if you don\u2019t have the correct certificate you could be in trouble. It\u2019s been hard for people with children. It seems crazy you can take your dog out for a walk but not your children. But over the last week, people with no garden can go 200m [from] their property to try and find something. It\u2019s not a massive area in comparison to Ireland, where it\u2019s 2km. But at least it gives people some availability to manoeuvre, particularly in the city centre. If you live in an apartment, like we do, it\u2019s very difficult to find a park.\u201d\nThe curbing of freedom is working, slowly, even if the death rate is still distressing. \u201cIt\u2019s well over 19,000 now,\u201d McKinley says, \u201cbut the rate of deaths per day is going down. The rate of infection is going down. That\u2019s all you can do \u2013 try and find something positive. Time will tell which measures have been most effective. It seems as if the UK started out doing things differently and now the lockdown is maybe not being followed as closely as in Italy.\u201d\nBritain has now passed the highest daily death rate suffered in both Italy and Spain. \u201cThe measures that have been taken by the Italian government have been heavily criticised by a lot of people,\u201d McKinley says, \u201cbut they\u2019ve worked pretty well. I think they\u2019ve acted in the best way they could have.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also helped that, from the outset, virtually all Italians have adhered to the rigorous lockdown while avoiding the kind of panic buying that accompanied the UK\u2019s initial response. \u201cA huge amount of credit has to go to the Italian people because there\u2019s been no panic buying. We\u2019ve not had any toilet paper wars here. Certain things like flour and eggs are a bit lower than normal. But it\u2019s never got to a stage where people are fighting over things. When people are backed into a corner, and there\u2019s a lot of adversity, you definitely get a sense of community spirit in Italy, of making sure that each person is OK. People are pulling together.\u201d\nMcKinley praises the way in which his club, Benetton, have tried to look after their players remotely but is he worried about pay cuts? \u201cThere is uncertainty. I would be happy to give an answer if I knew. But I really don\u2019t. I just know that many people \u2013 friends, family members and even my wife now \u2013 have lost their jobs. I\u2019m sure whenever that bridge needs to be crossed [in terms of his own contract], we\u2019ll cross it.\u201d\nHis own situation feels more precarious because, as McKinley admits, \u201cI haven\u2019t played many games this year. The difference with Italian clubs in relation to British and Irish rugby is that there are no second teams. We\u2019re a squad of 52 and only 23 people go out on to a rugby field to play. It\u2019s been a bit up and down for me this year.\n\u201cSo, yeah, this virus has thrown a spanner in the works. I have a contract this year with Benetton \u2013 but we can\u2019t say what will happen next season because people can\u2019t commit to anything. When you\u2019re cooped up in a house for months you can definitely think of the worst-case scenario. Or you can look at it as a good break for your body and time to reflect on what\u2019s really important. In terms of pay cuts I\u2019m sure players will not begrudge that because this is just such a huge issue.\u201d\nMcKinley has obviously come through testing times before. \u201cMy life was turned upside down in 2010 with the eye injury. And then, ultimately, when I made the decision in 2011 to retire. I moved to Udine when I was 22 and not knowing the language is tricky. You certainly learn a lot about yourself. You basically sink or swim in those situations. I adapted so I\u2019m forever grateful I made the decision to come over. I\u2019ve made friends for life.\u201d\nHe laughs when saying that he often dreams in Italian now. But McKinley pauses when I ask if Italy has changed him as a person. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question. I think it has. Absolutely. People have said to me: \u2018You were on course for this great career in Ireland,\u2019 and I was dealt that hand. Other people are dealt their hand and they have to get through whatever problems they\u2019ve faced. For me, it\u2019s opened up the world. So for example, working with the Laureus organisation in so many different areas of Italy has made me see how they use sport against violence, discrimination and disadvantage around the world. Now we\u2019re at a standstill Laureus is working closely with 200 sports and their development programmes globally to ensure they get support during the pandemic.\n\u201cSo, going back to your question about change through adversity, I would not be speaking Italian if I was still living in Ireland. I would not have been exposed to everything that has been so positive for me in Italy. I still want to perform at the highest level but so much else matters more.\u201d\nThousands of young rugby players around the world wear the goggles that McKinley helped pioneer \u2013 and he is contacted regularly by partially sighted people who still want to succeed in sport. \u201cI get messages weekly from people who have had similar injuries or problems to mine. That\u2019s incredible. And knowing that 2,000 people around the world are using rugby goggles is wonderful. The idea of the goggles were in the pipeline but my brother Phillip put me in touch with Johnny Merrigan, an Irish design student, who is a very important part of this story. Myself, Phillip and Johnny got together and basically pushed the product over the line.\u201d\nHas McKinley made anything out of the idea? \u201cNo. I\u2019ve never received one cent. But I was just happy when [the All Blacks\u2019] Ardie Savea started using them. You can\u2019t get a bigger name than him. I think being educated on the matter counts most. Like Covid-19, not many people knew about it. Now everyone seems to have read up on it.\u201d\nWhen I suggest that even the first time he gets tackled hard on the training field will feel good, McKinley grins. \u201cDepends who it\u2019s from. But the little things in life that you take for granted are going to seem sweet. To walk down to a coffee shop, and just talk to the people you know, your friends and rugby mates, will feel very special. But everybody is in the same boat. It helps to know that the vast majority of the human population is in this together.\u201d\nIan McKinley and Laureus encourage everyone to stay home, stay safe and stay healthy.",

People who have been in sustained proximity with someone who may have Covid-19 could then be warned and advised to self\u2013isolate, without revealing the identity of the infected individual.\nHowever, the memo stated that \u201cmore controversially\u201d the app could use device IDs, which are unique to all smartphones, \u201cto enable de-anonymisation if ministers judge that to be proportionate at some stage\u201d. It did not say why ministers might want to identify app users, or under what circumstances doing so would be proportionate.\nIt added that alternatives to building an NHS app included \u201cmaking use of existing apps and other functions already installed on people\u2019s phones (eg Google Maps).\u201d\nA spokesperson for NHSX, the digital transformation wing of the health service, which is overseeing the development of the UK contact-tracing app, denied there were ever plans to de-anonymise data, or use data from apps such as Google Maps.\n\u201cNHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cTo be very clear \u2013 there have never been plans to make use of existing apps and other functions already installed on peoples phones such as Google Maps and neither have there been plans to look to use the device ID of users in any app-based solutions.\u201d\nNHSX plans to harness data for the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic were made public after confidential documents, used by private contractors, were made accessible via an unrestricted portal that was seen by the Guardian.\nOn Friday, Google and Apple announced an unprecedented collaboration to provide the back-end technology that will enable governments to introduce contact-tracing apps that run on both iPhones and Android phones. Hancock did not specify which technology the government would use but said the NHS was \u201cworking closely with the world\u2019s leading tech companies\u201d.\nExplaining how the NHS app would work, Hancock said: \u201cIf you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you\u2019ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly.\u201d\nAdvocates of contact-tracing apps argue they could prove a vital tool to help governments emerge from lockdown conditions currently restricting the movement of millions.\nResearchers at the University of Oxford, who have been advising NHSX on the app, published a paper in the journal Science last month concluding that traditional contact tracing of those with Covid-19 was of limited use, in part because it can be spread by those who are asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic.\nInstead, the researchers argued, a contact-tracing app could speed up the process by automatically notifying contacts of people diagnosed with Covid-19. Prof David Bonsall, a senior researcher at Oxford University\u2019s Nuffield Department of Medicine, told the Guardian that \u201cwe see it as the only alternative to \u2026 applying isolation to the whole population.\u201d\nPrivacy International has said a Bluetooth LE system would be far less intrusive than other forms of tracking, such as using GPS or wifi data, because it would only keep a record of which devices had been near one another, rather than their actual locations.\nHowever, the draft memo raises questions about the use of contact-tracing apps if they are introduced without sufficient safeguards or transparency. The notion of \u201cde-anonymisation\u201d of users, in particular, would appear to contradict advice given by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) that identifying individuals from their location data may breach privacy law.\nThe deputy information commissioner said in a recent statement that data protection laws were not infringed as long as location data was \u201cproperly anonymised and aggregated\u201d. An ICO spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWhen personal data can be identified, organisations must comply with data protection law, including putting the appropriate safeguards in place to protect people\u2019s information.\u201d\nHowever, the creation of apps to battle Covid-19 raise unprecedented questions about privacy. Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who exposed the US National Security Agency\u2019s mass surveillance programmes seven years ago, has said the coronavirus could be exploited to usher in an era of bio-surveillance that persists even after the pandemic has ended.\nOthers are asking whether contact-tracing apps can really work, given that such large numbers of the population will need to download and use the technology for it to be effective, the lack of reliable testing, and the risk that such an open system could be abused by people fabricating symptoms. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, recently wrote that \u201canyone who\u2019s worked on abuse will instantly realise that a voluntary app operated by anonymous actors is wide open to trolling\u201d.",

About 47 people on the fourth boat were rescued on Monday morning by SMH, a Spanish NGO. In calls made to Alarm Phone from the boat, which was at sea in freezing temperatures for four nights, migrants said five people were unconscious and that a pregnant woman and her seven-year-old child were in need of urgent medical help.\n\u201cThey were really in a dire state,\u201d said Maurice Stierl, a researcher at the University of Warwick and member of Alarm Phone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous: EU states have known about this for 58 hours and have failed to intervene. We have no idea where the other three boats are, whether the people might have been rescued or whether they drowned.\n\u201cSome sources say there may have been one shipwreck but it\u2019s difficult to match boats that have capsized as there is no evidence and they simply disappear. There is also no evidence because states refrain from sharing information, and so we have asked Italy, Malta, Libya and the EU to provide information.\u201d\nThe boats are said to have been in distress in waters between Malta and Italy. On Saturday, the Maltese government banned rescue ships from bringing migrants to Malta.\nThe decision came a few days after the Italian government declared its own ports \u201cunsafe\u201d as the country struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Libya, where thousands of migrants are kept in detention camps, also closed its ports in March.\nBut migrants are still attempting journeys from Libya. On Sunday, Italy\u2019s transport ministry ordered those onboard the Alan Kurdi, a ship run by the German NGO Sea-Eye, to be moved to another vessel and tested and quarantined rather than be permitted to disembark.\nIn a letter addressed to the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, on Sunday, the 23 Italian MPs and three MEPs, wrote: \u201cWe implore you to act quickly to help those who need to be rescued at sea. We hear news of a shipwreck, of boats laden with humanity, desperately trying to reach the European coast. We ask the Italian government to intervene before it is too late.\u201d\nGregorio De Falco, one of the senators who signed the letter, said: \u201cThis is the time of year when migrant arrivals increase as the sea is usually calmer. In addition, there have been bombings in Libya very close to the coast where migrants are kept in detention centres \u2026 and so this pushes them to try and leave.\u201d\nIn Italy\u2019s unprecedented decree last week, the government said it would block the arrival of migrant rescue ships until the end of the coronavirus emergency. The decree was signed by the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese; the health minister, Roberto Speranza; the foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio; and the infrastructure minister, Paola De Micheli.\n\u201cThis decree is really ignominious,\u201d De Falco added. \u201cCoronavirus is being used as an excuse to say that Italy, and its people, would not be safe for shipwrecks or for migrants in general.\u201d\nThe EU has been criticised for failing to act. The Italian unit of Sea-Watch, the German NGO, tweeted on Sunday: \u201cLeft to die alone on the day of Easter by a Europe that speaks emptily of solidarity towards people who suffer.\u201d",

        "content": "Attacks and boycotts escalate amid false claims that Muslim group to blame for epidemic\nThe men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out \u201ccorona jihad\u201d.\nThe allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: \u201cTell us who else is behind this conspiracy.\u201d Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital.\nFive days after the attack Ali\u2019s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. \u201cIf we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,\u201d said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a \u201ccorona suspect\u201d, though he had no symptoms.\nThe attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India\u2019s Muslim community, who are being accused of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority.\nAlready a minority under attack \u2013 it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims in religious riots in Delhi \u2013 Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called \u201ccoronavirus terrorists\u201d, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.\nThe troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India.\nAcross the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (\u00a3105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering.\nIn a statement this week, the Indian Scientists\u2019 Response to Covid-19 group said \u201cthe available data does not support the speculation\u201d that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat. The scientists emphasised that while testing for coronavirus is extremely low across India, a disproportionate number have been of members of Tablighi Jamaat, as per a government order, therefore heavily skewing the figures.\nYet the test results were swiftly seized upon by members of the ruling ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who claimed Tablighi Jamaat members had intended to infect millions as part of an Islamic conspiracy and were carrying out \u201ccorona terrorism\u201d.\nSenior BJP leaders accused Tablighi Jamaat of carrying out a \u201cTalibani crime\u201d, described their members as \u201chuman bombs, but in the guise of coronavirus patients\u201d, and called for Tablighi Jamaat leaders to be both hanged and shot. Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader notorious for hate speeches, tweeted: \u201cTablighi Jamaat people have begun spitting on the doctors and other health workers. It\u2019s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them.\u201d\nThough quickly debunked, the rumours of Tablighi Jamaat members refusing to go into quarantine, assaulting hospital staff and throwing bottles of urine at Hindus quickly spread.\nHashtags such as \u201ccoronaJihad\u201d, \u201cCoronaTerrorism\u201d and \u201cCoronaBombsTablighi\u201d began to trend on Twitter in India. Mainstream Indian media repeatedly asserted that Tablighi Jamaat members were coronavirus \u201csuperspreaders\u201d.\nDr Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said that while Tablighi Jamaat had been shortsighted in holding the convention, there were \u201cdozens of examples of government, political parties and other religious groups who also flouted the coronavirus restrictions and gathered in large numbers\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cBut the whole focus is being directed only on Muslims. In the past few days, we have noted a new wave of attacks on Muslims across the country. There is talk of social boycott of Muslims, harassment of Muslims by Hindutva groups and Muslims are even being harassed by police in various areas.\u201d\nThere has been a concentration of attacks against Muslims in Karnataka, where a BJP MP, Anant Kumar Hegde, has denounced Tablighi Jamaat as terrorists. Shortly after, an audio clip began to be shared widely over WhatsApp, urging people not to allow Muslim fruit and vegetable sellers into their areas, claiming they were spreading the virus through their produce.\nSayed Tabrez, 23, and his mother, Zareen Taj, 39, were among seven Muslim volunteers who were assaulted by a gang of local BJP members on 4 and 6 April, as they tried to distribute food to impoverished people in the Marathahalli and Dasarahalli districts of Karnataka.\n\u201cSome 20 local BJP members came on motorbikes and started shouting at us, saying, \u2018You are not allowed to give out rations \u2013 you are Muslims so you all are terrorists spreading the disease. We know you are spitting in the rations and have come from Tablighi Jamaat to spread the virus\u2019,\u201d said Tabrez. Two days later, about 25 local BJP members followed them in vehicles before attacking Tabrez, his mother and the other volunteers with bats. Police have since arrested two people.\nIt is not an isolated incident. Manohar Elavarthy of the NGO Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been distributing lockdown rations, said dozens of attacks had been carried out against their Muslim volunteers in the past few days, including some by police.\nIn Mangalore this week, posters started appearing that said Muslims were no longer allowed in certain neighbourhoods. \u201cNo Muslim trader will be allowed access to our hometown until the coronavirus is completely gone,\u201d read a sign in Alape. In the Hindu-dominated village of Ankanahalli, a video seen by the Guardian shows Mahesh, the village panchayat president, issuing a warning that if any Hindu in the village is caught fraternising with a Muslim \u201cyou will be fined 500 to 1,000 rupees\u201d.\nThe hijacking of coronavirus as an excuse for discrimination comes after a growing state-sponsored campaign to turn Muslims into second-class citizens in India, as part of the BJP\u2019s agenda of Hindu nationalism. Attacks on Muslims have become commonplace and the recent citizenship amendment act, passed by the BJP in December, prompted millions to take to the streets in protest, saying it discriminated against Muslims.\nThe situation got so bad last week that it prompted Equality Labs, a US-based south Asian human rights organisation researching Islamophobic hate speech, to release a statement urging the World Health Organization to \u201cissue further guidelines against Covid-19 hate speech and disconnect it to religious communities\u201d.\n\u201cJust weeks after the Delhi pogrom where hundreds of Muslim houses and shops were vandalised, an uptick in misinformation and harmful communal language are leading to violence,\u201d said Equality Labs\u2019 executive director, Thenmozhi Soundararajan. \u201cThe threat of another pogrom still looms.\u201d",

We want to learn more about \nrecent decisions taken at the heart of government. If you're a \nwhistleblower or source and with new information, you can email\u00a0investigations@theguardian.com\u00a0or\n (using a non-work phone) send us a Signal or WhatsApp to this number \n(UK) +44 7584 640566. (The number does not take calls.) For the most \nsecure communications,\u00a0use SecureDrop\u00a0and for general advice on confidentially contacting the Guardian\u00a0see our guide.\nDespite plans from the Opec oil cartel and its allies to hold back about 10% of the world\u2019s supplies, or nearly 10m barrels a day, the price of Brent crude retreated to just above $30 a barrel on Monday morning.\nThe oil price steadied at just below $32 a barrel by the afternoon, but remained well below the $36 mark reached earlier this month in anticipation of the deal. The oil market began the year at $65 a barrel.\nThe rare global co-operation pact hammered out over the Easter weekend was backed by G20 nations outside of the Opec+ alliance including the US, Canada and Norway. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, told reporters the deal would help deepen the Opec+ production cuts to about 19.5m barrels of oil a day in total.\nHe said the G20 nations plan to cut about 3.7m barrels of oil a day from the world\u2019s global production. At the same time the Internal Energy Agency has agreed to buy 200m barrels of oil over the next few months which will be held in strategic reserve.\nBut industry experts fear the plan will not counter the debilitating effectthe coronavirus pandemic has had on global oil demand and leave the market oversupplied with crude for most of the year.\nGoldman Sachs warned that the \u201chistoric but insufficient\u201d deal would not go far enough to prevent supplies from overwhelming the world\u2019s oil storage facilities and forcing producers to shut their wells.\nThe US bank said oil prices would fall further in the coming weeks because the voluntary production cuts brokered by Opec were \u201cstill too little and too late\u201d to tackle a 19m barrel a day demand slump during April and May.\nMarket analysts at the French investment bank BNP Paribas said the deal may \u201cat best\u201d help to set a floor on the market\u2019s sliding oil prices before a recovery was possible later this year.\nDonald Trump said the plan to cut 20m barrels a day from global oil production would ensure that the energy industry is \u201cstrong again, far faster than currently anticipated\u201d.\n\u201cHaving been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that Opec+ is looking to cut is 20 million barrels a day, not the 10 million that is generally being reported,\u201d the US president said on Twitter.\nOpec plans to keep a hold on oil production until April next year. This may help to buoy prices in the second half of the year as demand for oil to produce transport fuels begins to recover as coronavirus travel restrictions ease.\nMorgan Stanley lifted its forecasts for oil prices for the second half of the year by $5 to between $30 and $35 a barrel, and Citi believes prices could climb to between $35 and $45 a barrel.\nEnergy market experts at Rystad Energy said oil prices would be unlikely to return to pre-coronavirus levels this year, despite production cuts, because surplus oil supplies have already created a glut in the market.\n\u201cIt will take some time for the stocks to fall back,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cAfter weeks of volatility, the market is now reacting with more caution to speculation and waits for concrete agreements to risk hiking prices to different levels.\u201d\nBrent crude climbed from 18-year lows of below $23 a barrel earlier this month to more than $36 a barrel last week, as talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia appeared to signal an end to a bitter price war that threatened to compound the impact of the pandemic on the oil market.\nRiyadh and Moscow planned to pump record oil volumes this year to increase their market share before agreeing to lower production. Saudi Arabia appears to have changed tack by offering buyers discounted prices on oil deliveries next month to maintain a competitive edge while it adheres to the new deal.\nThe kingdom\u2019s biggest discounts, of between $3 and $5.50 below the market price for Brent crude, will be offered to buyers in Asia, according to a statement from the state oil company Saudi Aramco.",

The decision had been prompted by the government allowing some non-key workers to return to work this week but the plan was abandoned after a call from Irene Lozano on Sunday night.\nSociedad\u2019s squad were to return to their training complex individually and follow strict protocols whereby they would work one after the other rather than in groups. They would not shower there or occupy the dressing room. They had also been told the sessions were voluntary: players who wished to could continue working at home.\nThe club had discussed the plans with local police and health authorities but the decision lay with the government via the Consejo Superior de Deportes, which is in effect Spain\u2019s sports ministry. An email exchange was followed up by a call from Lozano, the CSD head, to the club\u2019s president, Jokin Aperribay.\nShe pointed out that the state of alarm does not allow a return for mass entertainment industries and, although Sociedad\u2019s interpretation of that rule differed from that of the CSD because there was no plan for group work still less public access, the club accepted Lozano\u2019s intervention.\nThe midfielder David Zurutuza said he could not understand the decision but Lozano praised Sociedad\u2019s attitude on social media. \u201cDialogue and understanding, always,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn order to return to some normality it is vital to fulfil the rules of confinement. Training sessions will return but not as an individual or irresponsible act from football, rather as another step along the path for a society returning to normality bit by bit.\u201d\nA club statement said: \u201cWe are fully aware of our responsibility and we are working on a plan for getting both our athletes and employees back to work following the protocols established by the [health] authorities.

The tweet noted that Bono had been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. The rock star met South Korea\u2019s president last December after performing in the country.\nSouth Korea makes PPE and other medical kit that many countries are seeking to combat Covid-19.\nIreland\u2019s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, contacted Bono in late March to enlist him in a public-private collaboration that last week obtained supplies from China, the Irish Times reported.\nIn addition to Moon and Cook, Bono has contacted Jack Ma, the head of the Chinese retailer Alibaba, Marc Benioff of the software giant Salesforce and Doug McMillon of Walmart.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think this is the moment for U2 to be doing a sort of Kumbaya thing. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for me \u2013 it feels like a time for action rather than words,\u201d the singer told the Irish Times, which described the collaboration as an example of Ireland\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d.\nLiam Casey, the founder of the tech supply chain business PCH, which is part of the public-private alliance, said Bono\u2019s lobbying had clinched new suppliers including a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Tencent. \u201cThe power of Bono on the ground \u2013 I was able to go to some of the bigger companies and that really opened the doors for us.\u201d\nU2 has pledged to donate \u20ac10m (\u00a38.7m) to support healthcare workers in Ireland, which is expected on Monday to pass 10,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. It has recorded 334 deaths.\nLast month Bono performed his first new music since 2017 with a song inspired by quarantined Italians.

        "content": "Global movement encourages honest and open conversation online about mortality\nHosts of \u201cdeath cafes\u201d are reporting a global surge in demand for honest conversation about \u201cthe nitty-gritty of dying\u201d, and say the coronavirus pandemic has made frank discussion about our mortality more necessary than ever.\n\u201cIn these difficult times, as death comes closer, it\u2019s very important to have a forum to talk about our fears and anxieties,\u201d says Sue Barsky Reid, a psychotherapist who chaired the UK\u2019s first death cafe in 2011 and now coordinates, with her daughter Jools, the international movement that has established more than 10,000 similar meetings in 70 countries over the past decade.\nShe adds that hosts around the world have quickly moved events online as interest grows in the social franchise, which brings together strangers in an accessible, respectful and confidential space to reflect both on the finite nature of life and also how they might best plan for its ending.\nNicole Stanfield, organiser of the Taunton, Somerset, death cafe, held two online events over a recent weekend and welcomed virtual visitors from across England as well as one from France: \u201cIt was amazing to see the geographical spread. I\u2019ve been surprised by the amount of interest, but people are looking for answers. We\u2019re only going to see more death during this pandemic, so people are suddenly thinking about living wills, advanced care discussions and funeral planning.\u201d\nHosts in the US describe a similar online effect, despite the physical restrictions of lockdown. \u201cPeople are being forced to face their own mortality every waking moment,\u201d reports Megan Sipe-Mooney, who organises cafes in Missouri. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge need right now and I\u2019m getting lots of requests on our Facebook page. I\u2019ve been training other hosts in how to host virtual death cafes and make sure tea, coffee and cake is still present.\u201d\nThe reference to cake is not flippant: proper refreshments are fundamental to the relaxed and often upbeat atmosphere that death cafes aim for, and which marks them out from a more traditional counselling or educational setting.\nDeath cafes have become a global phenomenon, spreading across Europe, North America and Australasia since Jon Underwood held his first one in September 2011 at his home in Hackney, east London, chaired by his mother Sue. Underwood \u2013 a web developer and Buddhist who died suddenly in 2017 \u2013 had been inspired by the Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz, whose stated mission was to liberate death from an atmosphere of \u201ctyrannical secrecy\u201d.\nConversations have become far more practical since the outbreak, explains Aly Dickinson, a death cafe host based in Exeter. \u201cPeople are realising that deaths during this pandemic won\u2019t be what they might have envisaged, or thought of as a so-called \u2018good death\u2019 \u2013 gently slipping away, surrounded by family and friends. So the conversations are about how death from Covid might look now \u2013 for example, people may decide they do not want to be hospitalised and receive invasive medical interventions or face restricted visiting from loved ones.\u201d\nDickinson has been involved with half a dozen cafes since the pandemic began, in her role as secretary of End of Life Doula UK, a membership organisation for death doulas, who provide non-medical support to those with a terminal diagnosis.\n\u201cThey want to discuss the nitty-gritty, like: will I be able to get out to register the death, could we have a wake remotely, how do we share grief and memories when we\u2019re apart? People are wanting hard facts and information about what dying of Covid-19 is actually like. Maybe there\u2019s not quite so much laughter, as the mood is more serious.\u201d\nWith cafes also planned in Australia, Canada, Japan, Denmark and beyond throughout April, some hosts suggest that the gradual embrace of online meetings will allow death cafes to extend their support even further.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked in the past about how nobody wants to discuss death and dying\u201d, Dickinson adds, \u201cand suddenly that conversation is right in front of us, in the media and also our own families and communities. So at the death cafes that have taken place since the pandemic, the biggest change is that people are talking about death in a here-and-now way, rather than as something distant.\u201d",

He urged Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to present \u201ca single, united line\u201d on how to tackle the pandemic.\nIn a clear dig at Bolsonaro\u2019s repeated defiance of distancing guidelines, Mandetta said: \u201cWhen you see people going into bakeries, to supermarkets \u2026 this is clearly something that is wrong.\u201d\nPresidente @jairbolsonaro p\u00e1ra para comer numa padaria de Bras\u00edlia. pic.twitter.com/uVcRWqyZDj\nBrazil\u2019s far-right leader visited a supermarket in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, on 29 March and a bakery last Thursday, where he hugged and took photographs with fans.\n\u201cNo one will hinder my right to come and go,\u201d Bolsonaro vowed at a pharmacy on Friday.\nDuring Mandetta\u2019s interview \u2013 which Bolsonaro reportedly took badly \u2013 he also appeared to liken his boss\u2019s aversion to distancing to the behaviour of an uncooperative diabetic who refused to follow doctor\u2019s orders not to eat sweets.\n\u201cWe can say to them: \u2018This is going to cause you problems, your kidneys will fail, you might suffer vision loss, or have your leg amputated\u2019,\u201d the health minister said. But some would insist on eating sweets.\nOthers have harsher words for Bolsonaro, who experts fear is hastening Brazil\u2019s march towards a healthcare calamity.\nOn Saturday, Merval Pereira, a prominent political commentator, accused the president of behaving like \u201ca mystical leader leading his followers to collective suicide\u201d.\nBolsonaro, who claims to be defending Brazil\u2019s economy, has championed what he calls \u201cvertical isolation\u201d \u2013 the domestic shielding of only the elderly and at-risk groups.\nWithin Brazil\u2019s medical community, that suggestion has been opposed as ineffectual and misguided.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. To me it is like a swimming pool with four people in it \u2013 and only two of those people are allowed to urinate,\u201d said Ricardo Sobhie Diaz, an infectious diseases specialist from S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Federal University.\nOn Sunday, as Brazil\u2019s recorded 99 new Covid-19 deaths, taking the death toll to 1,223, Bolsonaro falsely claimed \u201cthis matter of the virus appears to be going away\u201d.\nMandetta warned \u201cvery tough days\u201d lay ahead, with May and June likely to be critical months.",

It is the lowest number since NHS England began recording comparable data in 2010, and the health service said it was likely to be a result of the Covid-19 response.\nA separate dataset from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, released on 3 April, which collects figures from 50 NHS trusts in England, shows emergency attendances had fallen to 58,447 \u2013 down from 73,801 the previous week.\n\u201cWe are concerned that this drop in attendance may mean that people with serious health problems are avoiding going to their emergency department for fear of getting coronavirus,\u201d said the college\u2019s president, Dr Katherine Henderson.\nShe added: \u201cWhile this is the lowest number of attendances since 2010, it is the highest-ever level of admissions as a proportion of attendances \u2013 this of course reflects the high acuity of patients presenting with Covid-19 problems, but in fact is something that has been increasing for some time. Even before Covid-19, we knew that patients were getting sicker \u2013 people are living longer and acquiring more health problems.\u201d\nThe government is now planning a major public awareness campaign to stress that the NHS is still there for those who need it. The advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi is understood to be working on the campaign without payment and it is expected to be launched in the next few weeks.\n Simon Ray, president of British Cardiovascular Society, said he welcomed a campaign to draw attention to the problem. \u201cThe biggest concern is that it seems there has been a uniform reduction in hospital attendances for heart attacks that has been noted in Italy, Spain and here. The magnitude looks the same everywhere: it\u2019s around 40% down in terms of callouts for emergency treatment for heart attacks.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThen there also seems to be substantial reduction in referrals in for with acute coronary syndrome, which is one step down from a heart attack, so people coming in with chest pain \u2013 those attendances also seem to have gone down a lot. That is harder to quantify, but the decrease in those is at least as large, and also seen across southern Europe and the US.\u201d\n \u201dAnecdotally, and only anecdotally, a number of units have also reported people presenting late with complications due to having a heart attack that we don\u2019t normally see. The concern is people sitting out symptoms rather than calling help.\u201d\nDavid Davis, a spokesman for the College of Paramedics said: \u201cThe NHS is still open for business, thanks to the sacrifice that everyone is making by staying at home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that members of the public who are suffering with life-threatening emergencies like stroke, heart attack, severe bleeding or breathing difficulties still call 999. By having a long-lasting, nationwide lockdown it means that there are still paramedics available to provide emergency care.\u201d\nThe number of people attending A&E with heart attack symptoms dropped from 300 per day at the beginning of March, to 150 by the end of March. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is extremely serious, but it\u2019s concerning if it also means people\u2019s fears about the virus are putting them off calling 999 when they suffer heart attack symptoms.\n\u201cThese are uncertain times, and it\u2019s understandable that people might feel apprehensive about having to go to hospital or putting unnecessary strain on the NHS. But heart attacks don\u2019t stop for a global pandemic.\n\u201cDon\u2019t delay because you think hospitals are too busy \u2013 the NHS still has systems in place to treat people for heart attacks and they are still a top priority \u2026 you should always dial 999 immediately if your chest pain is sudden, spreads to your arms, back, neck or jaw, and feels heavy or tight, or if you become short of breath or start to feel sick.\u201d",

Such flexibility could be critical since many jurisdictions have had to significantly scale back in-person voting options as poll workers have dropped out over Covid-19 concerns.\n\u201cWe know that barriers to voting existed before this crisis, especially for young people and communities of color,\u201d Obama said in a statement.\n\u201cExpanding access to vote-by-mail, online voter registration and early voting are critical steps for this moment \u2013 and they\u2019re long overdue.\n\u201cThere is nothing partisan about striving to live up to the promise of our country; making the democracy we all cherish more accessible; and protecting our neighbors, friends and loved ones as they participate in this cornerstone of American life.\u201d\nDonald Trump has strongly resisted calls to increase vote by mail. The president, who himself voted by mail in March, has falsely said that casting mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud, which is extremely rare.\nTrump has also said making it easier to vote would mean \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d.\nRepublicans in Congress have strongly resisted efforts to expand voting by mail and other efforts to ease voting restrictions.\nObama\u2019s announcement comes less than a week after a disastrous election in Wisconsin, where voters went to the polls while the state was under a stay-at-home order.\nAn unprecedented 1.2 million people requested absentee ballots, overwhelming election officials. There were several reports from voters who never received ballots in the mail, prompting an investigation from the Wisconsin elections commission and the United States Postal Service.\nWithout mentioning Trump, Barack Obama indirectly weighed in on his comments last week, tweeting that a pandemic shouldn\u2019t be used to \u201ccompromise our democracy\u201d and encouraging Americans to \u201ccheck the facts of vote by mail\u201d.\n\u201cEveryone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen,\u201d Obama said in another tweet.\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue.\u201d",

A costume designer for The Lion King stage show has even helped connect them with a tailor.\n\u201cIs there a case of saying this really shouldn\u2019t be necessary? It\u2019s unprecedented circumstances and I think the procurement process perhaps isn\u2019t sufficiently nimble for the current situation,\u201d Price said.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m constantly welling up and humbled by people\u2019s loveliness,\u201d she added. \u201cFrom people dropping off quarantined fabric in a socially distanced way with a shy smile, to the top West End tailors, everyone is just desperate to do what they can to help.\u201d\nDenise Cleal is the wardrobe supervisor at the Barn Theatre in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. After finding herself at a loose end when the theatre was shut, she has instead turned her sewing machine skills to making scrubs at home.\n\u201cYou do feel quite under pressure because you know that a surgery is sitting there waiting for you to finish making them,\u201d said Cleal, who has been using spare material from the theatre wardrobe. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a hobby or \u2018Oh yeah, I think I\u2019ll do a bit now\u2019. I\u2019m working 10 hours a day.\n\u201cBut the sewing is a pleasure and to be able to put it to such a worthy cause is tremendous for me,\u201d she said.\nWhile some hospitals specify plain dark fabrics, others have said they are happy for the scrubs to be made from different coloured or patterned material, meaning the sewers can use fabric donations such as good quality, clean bedding.\nFor Maxwell, making the scrubs is an important way of supporting her daughter Emma, a nurse sister at Rotherham hospital working on the frontline treating Covid-19 patients.\n\u201cIt takes my mind off where she is and what she\u2019s doing because obviously as a parent I worry when I see things on the TV,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do, not for a round of applause.\n\u201cThe business might not come through this, and if it doesn\u2019t then so be it \u2013 we\u2019re trying to save lives and that\u2019s what it\u2019s got to be about now.\u201d\n Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

A swarm of just more than a third of a square mile can eat the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people.\nThis second invasion from breeding grounds in Somalia includes more young adults which are especially voracious eaters.\nIn its latest locust watch update, the UN said the situation was \u201cextremely alarming\u201d as an increasing number of new swarms form in north and central Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.\nUganda reported two swarms arriving last week from neighbouring Kenya, further destabilising food security and the livelihoods of people in the east and north of the country. The insects follow spring rains, seeking emerging crops and other vegetation.\nHellen Adoa, a minister at Uganda\u2019s agriculture department, said: \u201cThis is very active, destructive and we are worried it has come at the time of lockdown. We are a bit overwhelmed.\n\u201cThe moment they arrive in a place the first thing they do is to eat anything green. They have destroyed some fields of crops and vegetation,\u201d she said.\nKenyan officials have said coronavirus crackdowns have slowed efforts to fight the infestation, as crossing borders has become harder and pesticide deliveries are held up. Aerial spraying is the only effective means of controlling locusts but there have been complaints that the pesticides are affecting livestock.\nIn February, eight east African countries experienced the worst outbreak in 70 years, exacerbated by climate change and war in Yemen.\nThe insects can travel about 90 miles a day and eat their own body weight in crops.\n\u201cHeavy rains in late March established favourable breeding conditions for yet another generation of locusts in the Horn of Africa. These will emerge as young swarms in June, just as many farmers start to harvest,\u201d said Antonio Querido of the UN\u2019s food and agriculture agency in Uganda.\n\u201cBy now, most farmers have planted the first season annual crops. If the locust swarms persist and control operations are not effectively undertaken the food crops will be lost and agriculture-based livelihoods will be impacted upon.\n\u201cImmature swarms are the most voracious stage of locust development. They are aggressive feeders and as such can cause a lot of damage to crops and forage.\u201d\nChristine Apolot, the chairperson for Uganda\u2019s Kumi district, which was hit by a swarm last week, said people were filled with despair, having already endured flooding and the previous swarm: \u201cThis is seriously going to bring food insecurity. It\u2019s the fear we have at hand right now.\n\u201cAs we were hopeful of to receive some relief food to support the situation on ground, the locust invaded and Covid-19 lockdown is moving towards devastating the economy.\n\u201cWe expect government, number of partners and World Food Programme to come to our rescue with relief food. Otherwise our people will end with starvation.\u201d",

A Downing Street spokesman said on Monday the prime minister had spoken to the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, who is currently deputising for Johnson, over the weekend. \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work,\u201d the spokesman said.\nFor the moment, it seems, Johnson is heeding the advice of medics, family, friends and cabinet colleagues and concentrating on getting well. And Chequers, set at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, and 40 miles (65km) away from the hustle and bustle of the government base in Whitehall, is the perfect place to do so, with its views of fields of cattle and sheep. To aid his recuperation, he can swim gentle lengths in the heated indoor swimming pool housed in the orangery.\nWhile in Downing Street, the prime minster was confined in his sealed-off flat with his meals left at the door between Nos 10 and 11. Chequers has its own kitchens, led by a head chef well used to providing formal dinners for a rich variety of VIPs including the Queen, world leaders such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and celebrities including Sir Elton John, Bryan Adams and David Bowie.\nCarol Thatcher once likened Chequers to a \u201cboutique hotel, albeit with top-level security\u201d and the \u201cperfect weekend retreat\u201d in complete contrast to the Downing Street terrace. Her father, Denis, used to enjoy practising his chipping and putting on the vast lawn, while her mother, Margaret, did her prime ministerial work in the study.\nDavid Cameron once told the former French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande that it was \u201ca good place for thinking \u2013 away from London\u201d.\nChequers was given to the nation in 1917 by Sir Arthur Lee, a Conservative minister and a director-general of food production during the first world war, and in Lloyd George became its first prime ministerial occupant in 1921. As set out in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, it was hoped to draw the sitting PM to \u201cspend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern Hills and woods\u201d.",

In Britain, that has meant the propagation of a random conspiracy theory about a link between coronavirus and 5G wireless technology \u2013 which almost a third of people say they can\u2019t rule out.\nIn the US, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center, about a third of Americans surveyed believe that Covid-19 was created by humans in a laboratory.\nPew surveyed 8,914 American adults, asking them whether they believed that 1) the current strain of the coronavirus \u201ccame about naturally\u201d; 2) \u201cwas developed intentionally in a lab\u201d; 3) \u201cwas made accidentally in a lab\u201d; or 4) \u201cdoesn\u2019t really exist\u201d.\nMost Americans surveyed in the report (43%) believed that Covid-19 most likely came about naturally, but nearly three in 10 (29%) said it most likely was created in a lab. What\u2019s more, most of those who believed the virus was created in a lab believed it was done so intentionally (23%). A quarter said they weren\u2019t sure where the virus originated, while 1% believed that the virus does not exist.\nThose most likely to believe in the conspiracy were Republicans or Republican-leaning independents (37% v 21% of Democrat or Democratic-leaning voters). About four in 10 conservative Republicans who replied believed in the conspiracy theory (39%), the largest share of any ideological group.\nThe research showed that the conspiracy was more prevalent among younger people than adults: about a third of adults aged 18 to 29 said the virus was developed in a lab (35%), compared with 21% of adults 65 and older. A fifth (19%) of people with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher believed that the coronavirus was created in a lab.",

That is a 50% increase on the 2,000 identified in 2018.\nWhat does the term \u2018county lines\u2019 mean?\nThe name \u2018county lines\u2019 refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares. Gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool use children to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones\u00a0to smaller towns and rural areas.\nWho are the victims and how are they recruited?\nThe majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted.\nMany victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them with images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation.\nHow big is the problem?\nIn 2015, about seven forces reported county lines behaviour. Now, 44 forces, including British Transport Police, have recorded county lines behaviour on their turf.\u00a0\nNo one really knows how many young people across the country are being forced to take part. Children without criminal records \u2013 known as \u2018clean skins\u2019 \u2013 are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives. The Children\u2019s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children\u2019s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs.\nHow many children have been affected\nThe number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 \u2013 nearly three times the 720 previously established.Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making \u00a3800,000 profits in a year.\nThe Children's Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs.\nDespite the drug runners being heavily dependent on the rail network, in the last week the BTP county lines taskforce has made 10 county lines arrests and seized two consignments of drugs, three lots of weapons and \u00a38,000 in cash.\nAmong the arrests made since lockdown conditions were imposed on 23 March was that of a 16-year-old girl in Preston who was found to have a sizeable quantity of cash.\nThe activity, which Williams said was reflective of a typical week for the taskforce, is set against the backdrop of a 94% reduction in rail travel. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen a reduction,\u201d Williams said of county lines activity in the lockdown period. \u201cBut the reduction in train services and the requirement to have an essential purpose for your journey is making it incredibly easy for us. If you\u2019ve got a 15-year-old from London in Bournemouth in the afternoon but he hasn\u2019t got an essential purpose, then they are easy to spot.\u201d\nThe taskforce was established in December after receiving a \u00a31m government grant to tackle county lines drug trafficking. Williams set up a dedicated team of 35 staff across London and south-east England, Birmingham and the north-west.\nWilliams said that while those in the team were based in major drug \u201cexport\u201d locations, they had been deployed to unexpected areas to tackle the problem, including Colwyn Bay, Skegness, Telford, Basingstoke and Shrewsbury.\nIn its first four months the taskforce has been involved in 272 arrests, 145 seizures of drugs, including class A substances, and the confiscation of \u00a3108,000.\nThe Covid-19 lockdown was expected to hit county lines gangs\u2019 chosen method of distributing drugs across the country \u2013 that of forcing young people to carry them by public transport. But despite coaches no longer running and some hire car companies providing vehicles only for essential journeys, BTP is still identifying runners and victims of exploitation on the rail network.\n\u201cOur ambition before this became well known was to stop the railway network from being the option of choice for criminal gangs to use people. If we succeed in that, then at the very least we\u2019re moving our demographic from ages 14, 15 up to 18, 19, 20 \u2013 people who can hire cars,\u201d said Williams.\nHe said he expected restrictions on international travel to lead to a slowdown in the supply of illicit drugs, which will have a knock-on effect on prices and in turn could raise the risk of violence.\nMeanwhile, Nottinghamshire police have said the lockdown measures made it easier to spot drug dealers in the community, with neighbours reporting large numbers of people visiting certain properties for short periods of time.\nDet Supt Mike Allen, of the force\u2019s serious organised crime unit, told the Nottingham Post: \u201cThese citizens used to be at work in the day and did not see what was going on in their community, but now they suspect. Drug dealers rely on hiding in plain sight, but because of lockdown these tactics do not work and pose a problem. They do not have that luxury any more.\u201d\nHe added that officers had been redeployed from roles such as policing city centre streets over the weekend to help the department out, while quieter roads had given them the opportunity to catch more dealers attempting to transport drugs in and out of the county.",

        "content": "From Vertonghen to Cavani, there are a lot of players in Europe who do not know if they will finish the season with their clubs\nA Premier League best XI in this predicament come 1 July:\nBen Foster. The 37-year-old is a consistent shot-stopper and has nine clean sheets from 29 games for Watford this season. Without a player of his calibre, Watford would not have climbed out of the relegation zone.\nJan Vertonghen may have not had his best season with Tottenham but he has more than 300 Premier League appearances and a fresh start could inspire a return to his best. At the other end of the spectrum Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has in Japhet Tanganga another talented centre-back whose contract is due to end. The 21-year-old has been one of the few positives from a difficult period at the club. Tanganga withstood a baptism of fire on debut against Liverpool despite switching from right- to left-back in the second half.\nAt right-back, Nathaniel Clyne has fallen so far down the pecking order at Liverpool, some people still think he is out on loan at Bournemouth, where he made 14 league appearances last season. The former Crystal Palace defender is still only 29 years old and has 14 England caps to his name, so is not a lost cause for any willing clubs. The cupboard looks a little bare at left-back but Christian Fuchs is a Premier League winner with Leicester. The little playing time the Austrian has had this season and last should mean he has plenty in the tank even at 33.\nAdam Lallana, Jeff Hendrick and John Lundstram. Lallana has featured only in patches for Liverpool but has shown he can drive his team forward. When called on late by J\u00fcrgen Klopp he delivered an equaliser against Manchester United to save the leaders\u2019 unbeaten run in October.\nBurnley\u2019s once-record signing Hendrick scored a game-saving goal of his own against Brighton and a winner against Everton. After a dip Sean Dyche\u2019s team have impressed with Hendrick a key part of the industry that has led to a five-game unbeaten run, their best this season.\nLundstram has shone in his first season in the Premier League with Sheffield United. He was the fall guy after Sander Berge signed for a record fee in January but a return to the starting lineup in United\u2019s final game before the shutdown paid off for Chris Wilder. Lundstram\u2019s delicious cross for Billy Sharp was the creative spark needed to beat Norwich.\nRyan Fraser admitted in January he had not \u201cplayed for the team\u201d at Bournemouth in the first half of the season and the left winger\u2019s form has suffered. With a change of scenery he could bounce back. Fraser managed seven goals and 14 assists last season and the lack of such a contribution has been missed by Eddie Howe.\nChelsea\u2019s Willian and Olivier Giroud complete a formidable front three. The Brazilian is one of Frank Lampard\u2019s most consistent players, as is his touch, range of passing and delivery from free-kicks. A match-winning double at Tottenham in December showcased his devastating ability. Giroud has been frustrated by Lampard using him sparingly while Tammy Abraham was injured. Giroud finally got a start against Tottenham in February and link-up play was so good it resulted in a goal for himself in Chelsea\u2019s win. Giroud\u2019s header found Mason Mount, who squared to Ross Barkley and the latter\u2019s shot rebounded for Giroud to lash past Hugo Lloris.\nNice\u2019s Walter Ben\u00edtez is the best goalkeeper available, with Gianluigi Buffon on speed dial should he not sign a new deal with Juventus. The Argentinian kept the most clean sheets in Ligue 1 last season with 16. Ben\u00edtez will need to be on his toes too as Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s attack-minded trio Thomas Meunier, Tanguy Kouassi and Layvin Kurzawa slot into defence with their experienced teammate Thiago Silva. The 17-year-old Kouassi showed his eye for goal with a pair of headers that helped drag PSG to a 4-4 draw with Amiens in February.\nIn midfield Milan\u2019s Giacomo Bonaventura and Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Charles Ar\u00e1nguiz flank Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Mario G\u00f6tze. G\u00f6tze has declined since he won the World Cup for Germany in 2014 but, if he can stay fit, he has a lot to offer at 27.\nThe front three have an eye-watering 811 league goals between them: Napoli\u2019s Dries Mertens, PSG\u2019s Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are up for grabs, assuming the one-year option is not triggered at Milan on Ibrahimovic\u2019s contract.",

Almost half of the deaths (280) were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. The civil protection authority said the number of people who were currently infected had risen by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, a further sign that the curve there is flattening.\nAt least 1.8 million people have been infected and 116,098 have died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have been tracking official and media reports. The tallies are likely to be underestimates due to different testing regimes and suspected underreporting of figures.\nA total of 11,329 patients have died in UK hospitals after testing positive, the UK\u2019s Department of Health said, up by 717 from 10,612 in 24 hours.\nBelgian health authorities reported 303 more deaths in 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,903. Its death toll is lower than those in other European countries and the US due to its smaller population, but proportionally, the outbreak is now more deadly than in Italy.\nHealth authorities in Singapore confirmed 386 more cases, the city-state\u2019s biggest daily jump since the outbreak began there. That takes its total to 2,918 cases. A large number of the new cases are linked to outbreaks in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories.\nAs time runs out on emergency measures to limit the outbreak in Germany, the country\u2019s National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions, as long as new infections stabilise and personal hygiene measures are maintained.\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves to lift some lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating were still crucial to controlling the outbreak.\nRobert Redfield, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told NBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are nearing the peak right now \u2026 You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before. We are stabilising right now.\u201d\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said it was \u201cstill far too early\u201d to change the advice, adding that the UK would be getting ahead of itself if ministers relaxed restrictions before medical experts advised them to.\n\u201cThere will come a time in the future where we can talk about relaxation or transition, but we are not there now,\u201d he said.\nSpain\u2019s overnight death toll fell by 102 to 517 in 24 hours, bringing the total to 17,489, the country\u2019s health ministry said, adding that it was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began.\nThe country\u2019s death toll rose to 4,585, with 111 deaths overnight, a health ministry official said, adding that the total number of infected cases had reached 73,303 in the most affected Middle Eastern country.",

But it is a profession that has suffered badly as a result of government policy in recent years.\nSince the Conservatives came to power in 2010, the average salary for a nurse has fallen by 8% based on the consumer prices index (CPI) \u2013 or by \u00a32,646 in real terms, according to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN).\nRehana Azam, GMB national secretary, said that health workers \u201ccontinue to be punished by austerity pay policies\u201d, adding: \u201cThe government\u2019s new NHS salary arrangements fail to account for this grotesque loss which has consigned NHS workers to real-terms pay cuts. We need pay justice for the NHS workers, who are currently putting their safety at risk to save lives.\u201d\nMigrant nurses \u2013 as both McGee, 35, and Pitarma, 29, are \u2013 may face other difficulties too. During last year\u2019s election campaign, Johnson announced plans to increase the yearly surcharge for all non-EU migrant workers by more than 50% from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 and to extend it to all EU citizens who migrate to the UK after Brexit.\nThe fee is payable for each member of a family migrating, meaning nurses who come to Britain with a spouse and two children would have to pay the government \u00a32,500 a year for the privilege of working in the NHS.\nAnnouncing the change in November last year, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s the National Health Service not the International Health Service. Everyone should make a fair contribution towards our NHS.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the National Health Service not the International Health Service. Everyone should make a fair contribution towards our NHS - so after Brexit we\u2019ll extend the NHS surcharge to all non-UK residents. https://t.co/hYeBprtvrG\nFigures obtained by the Liberal Democrats last year showed that almost 5,000 nurses who were EU nationals had left the health service since the Brexit vote in 2016. Additionally, figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council showed that the number of nurses arriving from the EU dropped hugely, from 6,382 in 2016-17 to 805 in 2017-18.\nUntil 2018, a cap on skilled workers led to thousands of foreign nurses from outside the EU being denied visas. The rules were relaxed to make nurses exempt, amid a staffing crisis in hospitals. Nevertheless, according to the RCN, vacancies for nurses in England alone are running at about 40,000 currently.\nDonna Kinnair, RCN chief executive and general secretary, said: \u201cInternational staff are expected to pay twice for the very services they keep running \u2013 the government should remove this immoral immigration health surcharge for nursing staff without delay.\n\u201cAcross the UK, health and care services were already missing tens of thousands of nurses before this began \u2013 making this unprecedented challenge even more difficult to face.\n\u201cWhen this pandemic is over and pay negotiations begin, ministers must remember the dedication and sacrifice that was on display \u2013 properly rewarding staff will begin to address the long-term shortages in the nursing workforce.\u201d\nA cap on pay rises for NHS workers was lifted in 2018. The previous year, both Johnson and Hancock had voted against ending the cap. Sara Gorton, Unison\u2019s head of health, said pay freezes and caps had \u201ccaused much financial hardship and fuelled staffing shortages\u201d.\nMunira Wilson, the Lib Dems\u2019 health spokeswoman, said: \u201cNow more than ever, it is obvious to us all how much we value each and every healthcare worker \u2013 and just how many of them are from overseas yet risking their lives for our country.\u201d\nMcGee\u2019s mother, Caroline, said on Monday that her daughter had described the experience of treating the prime minister as \u201csurreal\u201d.\nShe told broadcaster TVNZ that her daughter, from Invercargill in New Zealand, was \u201cvery professional\u201d and waited until Johnson, 55, was out of intensive care to let her parents know that the prime minister was one of her patients.\nShe said her daughter told them \u201cshe had just had a most surreal time in her life, something she will never forget, and that she had been taking care of Boris\u201d. The prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, said the country was \u201cvery proud\u201d of McGee.\nFor his part, Pitarma, a senior staff nurse, was thanked by the Portuguese president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. His cousin, Ivo, a firefighter who lives in Aveiro, Portugal, said: \u201cI\u2019m obviously very proud. I knew of course that Luis was a nurse in London but had no idea he had been looking after Boris Johnson so this has come as a real surprise for me.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cDoctors, nurses, paramedics and health professionals from all over the world continue to play a leading role in our country\u2019s healthcare \u2026 as part of the national effort to combat coronavirus, frontline NHS workers will automatically have their visas extended free of charge, as outlined by the government in early April.\u201d",

It said there was an \u201cabundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints\u201d.\nIt was intended to be submitted as an annex to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry into Labour\u2019s approach to dealing with antisemitism. It is understood that it will now not be submitted.\nThe report was completed this year in the last months of Corbyn\u2019s leadership and its conclusions clash with complaints of whistleblowers, formerly working for Labour, who told BBC Panorama last year there had been political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn.\nThe report, seen by the Guardian, says it found no evidence of antisemitism complaints being treated differently from other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being \u201cmotivated by antisemitic intent\u201d.\n\u201cWe have also asked for immediate sight of any legal advice the Labour party has already received about the report,\u201d Starmer and Rayner said in a statement.\n\u201cIn the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the general secretary to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report.\u201d\nThe previous Labour leadership\u2019s handling of allegations of antisemitism against party members overshadowed parts of the 2019 general election campaign.

The majority of these souls are, like myself, foreign healthcare workers.\nI see worry on my wife\u2019s face every day I go to work. I understand she is imagining what will happen if I get the infection. What if I transmit the infection to our beloved son or to her? Will they be deported if I die? We were actually in the process of buying a home. What will happen to my family if I die and my wife has to pay a mortgage for a home they can\u2019t live in? I hear many of my non-UK citizen colleagues echo these concerns. We are really worried.\nThe government recently announced a one-year visa extension for foreign nationals who have expired visas. Is our need only limited while this pandemic lasts? Will our services then be no longer required? I and my colleagues believe the government should grant indefinite leave to remain to all foreign NHS staff. They will then have the right to permanently and freely reside in the UK without fear of deportation. It will give them the reassurance that the life they have built in the UK will be protected and their sacrifice is valued.\nOur plea is backed by the BMA and by a letter from 60 MPs to Priti Patel (Report, theguardian.com, 7 April). There is also a petition to parliament at tinyurl.com/NHScitizens (Letters, 8 April) with over 32,000 signatures.Dr Mohammed ElshamyPreston\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

You published a letter from us on 2 April, but we now feel the need to write a follow-up.\nOn Friday Matt Hancock stated: \u201cWe need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is \u2026 Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines; no more and no less\u201d (NHS workers angered at Hancock\u2019s warning not to overuse PPE, 10 April), thereby implying that our daughter and her colleagues are using PPE unnecessarily, without any clinical need. Does he think our healthcare professionals (HCPs) are putting on cumbersome personal protective equipment not because they are at risk from a deadly virus, but because they like the look of it?\nThis is an astonishing statement considering that this government is currently demonstrably failing to supply NHS employees with sufficient quantities of PPE. It is a monstrous diversion to claim that our daughter and her colleagues are somehow responsible for Mr Hancock\u2019s lack of foresight, planning and strategic management. Shame on him.\nOf course, we do not have any reliable government data relating to the number of deaths of HCPs. If Mr Hancock is so certain that staff are using PPE unnecessarily, he should publish this data so we can judge for ourselves; otherwise this is just a diversion and an attempt to cynically shift the blame for the lack of PPE on to overworked and distressed HCPs.\nRegarding the use by Mr Hancock and his colleagues of words like \u201cprecious resource\u201d, he will find none more precious than our daughter, who is watching her colleagues become ill, resulting in intensive care admission, patients left to die because they are too ill to rescue, and patients having to be left to die in isolation. Our most precious resource is going to be left with these images all her life.\nWe wonder how Mr Hancock is sleeping at night.Name and address supplied",

It points to an \u201cindustry\u201d whose longstanding structural failures have been brought to a tragic crisis by the epidemic. This grim situation should mobilise people to demand and initiate change in the way communal care-giving is organised in the UK.\nMy colleague Prof Chris Phillipson at the University of Manchester has posted a challenging proposal for radical reform on the British Society of Gerontology\u2019s Ageing Issues blog site. This would make it mandatory for homes to be restricted in size, for staff to be properly paid, and for businesses to be democratised within a model of common ownership. Anyone interested in building support for such a programme is invited to visit the site and add their comments.John MilesLondon\n Re your report on deaths in care homes from Covid-19 going unrecorded in official figures, this is an appalling example of older people in homes (as well as staff) being treated as third-class citizens. Urgent reforms of the sector are required but, in the meantime, immediate action is necessary.\nFirst, greater transparency is needed on the coronavirus-related deaths occurring in residential and nursing homes; the numbers should be reported at least once a week in the government\u2019s daily briefings. Second, any clusters of deaths should be highlighted, whether in an individual home or chain of homes, with the reasons explained and a record of the action taken. Third, the government should underwrite an immediate tripling in the average hourly pay rate of care workers; it is now below the basic rate paid in most supermarkets.\nThe situation is a tragic reminder of the effects of decades of neglect of social care. The need for change to the care home model has never been more pressing.Chris PhillipsonProfessor of sociology and social gerontology, University of Manchester\n The callous neglect of older people in nursing homes is a national scandal, but it is the predictable result of the long-term neglect of the care sector, compounded by the cuts to local authorities under Tory austerity. It used to be said that the test of a civilised society is how well it cares for its most vulnerable. Not only have we failed that test, but now the frailest and their poorly paid carers are on the Covid-19 frontline \u2013 just as they would have been if the immoral policy of herd immunity without a vaccine had continued.\nThe deep-seated ageism that governs policies on social care must be abandoned and frail older people, thousands of whom die of cold every winter, must be treated as full citizens with the right to good-quality social care. When they die, the least we could do is count their numbers.Alan WalkerProfessor of social policy and social gerontology, University of Sheffield\n Your report on care home deaths quotes a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson as saying: \u201cWe have also delivered 7.8m pieces of PPE to more than 26,000 care settings across the country and are rapidly working to extend testing to social care workers.\u201d This equates to 300 PPE items per care setting. I assume they mean since the start of the pandemic \u2013 a paltry three items per day. This is totally inadequate for the smallest care setting. At least one cannot accuse the department of being dishonest \u2013 just totally lacking in understanding, both of need and of the data it has on it.Roger GibsonBulkeley, Cheshire\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

A lot are saying how grateful they are.\u201d\nHowever, AA has had to issue guidelines and advice on how to secure the popular video meetings app Zoom, and prevent sessions from being \u201chijacked\u201d by what it described as \u201cbad actors.\u201d\nThe guidelines, which include using online waiting rooms and taking care not to include AA in the title of meetings held virtually in public, state: \u201cOf course, nothing prevents them from raising their hand and once called upon to start their obscene gibberish, but at least it\u2019s only one person, very easy to ban and not let back in for the rest of the meeting. Just like what happens at real meetings sometimes.\u201d\nThe AA warns members to expect \u201cexplicit, obscene porn, lewd images, foul language and verbal abuse (often directed at the lead/chairperson to invoke chaos). First and foremost, remain calm, having expected to experience this. Shock their primary goal. If you are calm, you can act quickly and decisively instead of react.\u201d\nBen, a pub owner from south-west England who spent a month in rehab before Christmas to try to overcome a 30-year alcohol habit, welcomed the prevalence of online forums but was concerned about reports of trolling from other users.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about people coming into Zoom meetings, stripping naked, or opening a can of booze and just sitting there,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey communicate with each other before and then come online in massive numbers, so it\u2019s really difficult to find them and block them.\u201d\nHe said he had remained sober since the lockdown began, despite the challenges: \u201cSelf-isolation is the perfect excuse to have a drink. If I was drinking at the moment, I would be completely out of control. It would be something I\u2019d really need and want, so I\u2019d find a way to get hold of it.\u201d\nDr Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK, said the treatment sector had adapted very quickly to the lockdown. As well as AA, Smart Recovery, another international organisation, is recruiting additional facilitators to run temporary online meetings as the Covid-19 crisis rolls on.\n\u201cBut we would still expect to see increasing challenges for people who have gone into recovery as this goes on,\u201d said Piper, who spoke of how the nature of the lockdown was heaping immense pressure on people who had established new routines as part of their recoveries.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the vast majority of problem drinking relates to people who drink at home. If your home is a place that you associate with drinking then you work really hard not to associate it with that. But if you are stuck in that home, essentially what we are speaking about are constant triggers.\u201d\nMichael Rawlinson, a treatment consultant at Clouds House, an addiction treatment centre, said he had seen a positive response to their recovery programme, with more frequent meetings, higher attendance and a greater geographical spread.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people accessing our online meetings from places like Chicago, people from all over the world hopping in and out,\u201d Rawlinson said. \u201cWhere we usually have 20 or 30 people, we\u2019ve now got three times that amount.\u201d\nBut he warned: \u201cI think we\u2019re in the honeymoon period at the moment. People are finding the Zoom meetings really new and exciting. As time progresses, I\u2019d expect to see people\u2019s behaviours change.\u201d",

But with racing across the world suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, he was taking part in an online competition called Monza Madness, organised by fellow driver Landon Cassill on Sunday night.\nLarson was streaming his participation live on Twitch when he appeared to lose communication on his headset. The 27-year-old then said to his spotter, \u201cYou can\u2019t hear me?\u201d before following up his question with the N-word.\nThere was immediate shock and outrage from his fellow drivers. Anthony Alfredo reminded Larson that viewers could hear his comments: \u201cKyle, you\u2019re talking to everyone, bud,\u201d said Alfredo.\nOn Monday, Ganassi issued a statement suspending Larson. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by what Kyle said last night during an iRacing event,\u201d read the statement. \u201cThe words that he chose to use are offensive and unacceptable. As of this moment we are suspending Kyle without pay while we work through this situation with all appropriate parties.\u201d\nNascar reacted shortly afterwards, indefinitely suspending Larson. \u201cNascar has made diversity and inclusion a priority and will not tolerate the type of language used by Kyle Larson during Sunday\u2019s iRacing event,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur Member Conduct Guidelines are clear in this regard, and we will enforce these guidelines to maintain an inclusive environment for our entire industry and fan base.\u201d\npic.twitter.com/RPsp7ARIea\nLarson has since apologised in a video posted to social media. \u201cI just want to say I\u2019m sorry. Last night I made a mistake and said the word that should never, ever be said,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for that. I wasn\u2019t raised that way. It\u2019s just an awful thing to say. I feel very sorry for my family, my friends, my partners, the Nascar community and especially the African-American community. I understand the damage is probably unrepairable, and I own up to that. But I just want to let you all know how sorry I am, and I hope everybody is staying safe during these crazy times. Thank you.\u201d\nLarson, whose mother is Japanese American, is a graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity programme, which is intended to promote wider participation in the sport. He has won six races in his eight years in the Nascar Sprint Cup series and was rookie of the year in 2014. In 2015 he won the 24 Hours of Daytona.\nThere has been a proliferation of esports competition since racing was suspended earlier this year, and Larson is not the first driver to find himself at the centre of controversy. Last week Bubba Wallace was dropped by a sponsor after he \u201crage quit\u201d during a race being broadcast live on Fox Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t take this shit serious. Peace out,\u201d he said before exiting.\nBen Blessing, an executive from Wallace\u2019s sponsor, Blue-Emu, condemned the driver\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sponsoring Bubba any more,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine if he did that in real life on a track? You find out that you aren\u2019t sponsoring a Nascar driver, you are sponsoring someone like my 13-year-old son who broke his controller playing some game where he builds houses.\u201d",

Monday is a public holiday in much of the country, including some of the most populous regions such as Catalonia and Valencia. Few commuters were visible at Madrid\u2019s usually bustling Atocha railway station.\nThe prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has insisted the country remains firmly in lockdown despite the easing of some restrictions. Shops, bars and public houses will remain closed until at least 26 April. The health ministry has called on those returning to work to stagger arrival times and to wear masks where physical distancing is not possible.\nRegional leaders have criticised the move amid fears that the hard-fought public health gains of recent days may be lost. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from the virus fell to 517 on Monday from 619 on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said.\nIt was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. Overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said the epidemic had passed its peak. The challenge now was to consolidate the second stage of the struggle against the virus and to reduce new infections, he said.\nThe trend across Europe appears to show a similar modest flattening of infection and death rates. Italy reported 566 deaths on Monday, 135 more than on Sunday. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 280 \u2013 were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus.\nThe civil protection authority said the number of people who are currently infected rose by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, in a further sign that the curve is flattening. The number of intensive care beds in use continues to decline, as does the number of people hospitalised for the virus.\nEuropean countries face the same dilemma as Spain: whether to ease some lockdown restrictions in order to salvage their battered economies, or to persevere with draconian measures until the decline in cases is conclusively achieved.\nItaly\u2019s government has set up a taskforce led by the former chief executive of Vodafone Vittorio Colao to navigate the country\u2019s exit from the coronavirus lockdown. The team of 17 will be responsible for devising a plan as part of \u201cphase two\u201d of the emergency.\nIt includes Enrico Giovannini, a former labour minister and professor at Tor Vergata University of Rome, as well as other economists, businesspeople, lawyers, sociologists and psychologists. Italy\u2019s lockdown is in place until 4 May, after which the country is expected to gradually reopen.\nGermany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, will decide on Wednesday whether to extend restrictions imposed in mid-March. They are due to expire on Sunday. The latest figures from the Robert Koch public health institute show the rate of infection slowing, with 2,537 new cases on Monday, taking the tally in Germany to 123,016.\nThe country\u2019s Academy of Sciences Leopoldina has recommended a gradual relaxing of measures. It said schools should reopen as soon as possible, starting with primary and middle schools, followed by shops and restaurants. All government officials should return to work, it said.\nAustria is to allow small shops to reopen from Tuesday, and larger ones from 1 May. All restaurants and hotels are due to resume business from mid-May. Denmark will reopen schools and day care centres from Wednesday, although restrictions on public gatherings and on bars and restaurants remain.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves by countries to lift lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus, and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating was still crucial to controlling the outbreak.\nHe said: \u201cWe know that in some countries, Covid-19 cases are doubling every three to four days. However, while Covid-19 accelerates very fast, it decelerates much more slowly. In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez said Spain\u2019s decision to reboot some sectors of the economy was taken following consultations with a committee of scientific experts. Any further winding \u2013 down would depend on gains made against the virus, he stressed. So far 500,000 people have been fined an average of \u20ac300 (\u00a3260) for breaking lockdown.\nIn other developments:\nRussia introduced a new digital permit system for anyone seeking to travel around Moscow during its lockdown. However, the website offering Muscovites a QR-code went offline just hours after launch. Moscow\u2019s mayor blamed an attack by foreign bots.\nChina reported 108 new cases, 98 of which were imported from overseas, its highest figure since early March. The country where the disease first emerged has largely brought its domestic outbreak under control, but it faces a fresh battle against imported infections, mostly involving Chinese nationals returning home.\nIndonesia announced 316 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections to 4,557, according to data provided by a health ministry official, Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto said there were also 26 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 399.\nJapan said it saw no reason at the moment to extend its state of emergency beyond Tokyo and a handful of other cities. The central government declared a state of emergency last week, giving legal authority to governors in Tokyo and six other potential virus hotspot prefectures to ask people to stay home and businesses to close.\nIndia and Pakistan are planning to partially open up some parts of their economies, officials in both countries said, as the cost of lockdowns mount across the region. Indian officials said the number of cases in the country increased to 9,152 on Monday, including 308 deaths. This is a sharp rise from fewer than 1,000 two weeks ago.",

Over 550 independent farmers supplied the plant.\nThe company that runs the plant, Smithfield Foods, announced the closure of its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on Sunday, a day after the state\u2019s governor, Kristi Noem, asked the company to suspend the plant\u2019s operation for at least 14 days.\nThe number of employees who worked at the plant and contracted the virus makes up over half of the state\u2019s positive cases. About 240 employees from the plant have contracted the virus.\nThe company said in a press release that the plant\u2019s furloughed employees will be compensated for the next two weeks.\nIn a statement, Smithfield\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth Sullivan, warned of \u201csevere\u201d repercussions to the meat supply chain if more manufacturing plants see similar spreads of Covid-19.\n\u201cThe closure of this facility, combined with a growing list of other protein plants that have shuttered across our industry, is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply,\u201d Sullivan said in the statement. \u201cIt is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running.\u201d\nOther meat manufacturers similarly shut down plant operations after multiple employees contracted Covid-19.\nTysons Food Inc halted a pork processing plant in Iowa after two dozen employees got the virus, while JBS USA closed a beef plant in Pennsylvania for two weeks after multiple plant managers reported flu-like symptoms.\nAcross the country, agricultural and food production workers are deemed essential and are allowed to work, often in close quarters, regardless of local shelter-in-place orders.\nWorkers at processing plants, like other groups of essential workers, have demanded workplace protections as the virus continues to spread. Plant workers have petitioned companies for better benefits, like paid sick leave and more protective equipment. In response, some companies have implemented pay raises and tried to utilize social distancing in plant operations.\nExperts say US consumers should not necessarily be worried about food shortages in the near future. Storage levels of staples including chicken, beef and soybeans were high before the virus hit the US full-force, and food suppliers are starting to reroute their inventories that would typically go to restaurants to supermarkets.\nBut concerns about the global food supply chain are growing, largely due to unease over trade.",

        "content": "Available online\n There are striking moments in the films of this dance group\u2019s performances, inspired by New York Trilogy and The Odyssey\n Hottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance to watch online\n The best arts and entertainment during self-isolation\nPre-coronavirus, one of this month\u2019s most intriguing premieres was set to be Project XO, a dance installation inviting the audience to wear a robotic exoskeleton and be choreographed by its movements. Masterminded by New Movement Collective, a group of superlative contemporary dancers who come together to make ambitious happenings, we\u2019ll have to bookmark that one for the future. But in the meantime, the company has made full-length films of its previous works available for free online.\nIt\u2019s an interesting proposition since the majority of NMC\u2019s work is immersive performance, the very opposite of watching a static screen. Even in well-shot pieces such as these, there\u2019s a question about whether the film stands alone as a piece of art, or merely a record of what took place. The live-ness of the experience is flattened, and rather than experiencing the serendipities of an improvised journey, the camera decides your view.\nYet, as anyone who\u2019s wandered confused around an immersive show will know, enforced focus can be a good thing. In Collapse (2016), one of the simplest scenes is made the strongest by the camera\u2019s framing. Four dancers run on the spot, side by side, with detached determination, variously overtaking and dropping back in an interminable race with each other that has no destination. A perfect physical metaphor for modern life.\nOne signature of the company is closely handled duets, often stripped of traditional gender roles. Another is their appetite for collaboration with technology, design and architecture. Casting Traces (2012) involved navigating a paper maze designed by architect Elin Eyborg. Inspired by Paul Auster\u2019s New York Trilogy, it\u2019s a piece full of mysterious strangers and doppelgangers, silhouettes and clever shadow play, and also a sense of cautious weariness that permeates a lot of NMC\u2019s work.\nNest (2013), took over the former Welsh Chapel (and ex-Limelight nightclub) in the West End of London to create a journey based loosely on Homer\u2019s Odyssey. Architects Studio Weave designed huge, grid-like steel frames for the dancers to move in and around (at one point a boat cleverly appears inside them), and stunning lighting projections from Marshmallow Laser Feast make it look as if the floor is buckling in waves under the dancers\u2019 feet. The flashing lights in the darkness, the clubby music mixed with Monteverdi \u2013 it was all pulse-raising when seen live and it\u2019s still impressive on screen.\nBut NMC\u2019s architectural attention to space loses potency when you\u2019re not experiencing it in three dimensions. And the things that make for curious surprise when you\u2019re exploring an atmospheric building \u2013 discovering someone wedged up into the ceiling or two dancers wearing pig masks \u2013 just feel random on film. Yet there are also small moments, easily missed, that shine through, such as a snippet of a duet from Jonathan Goddard and Gemma Nixon, two dancers with rare affinity, moving with absolute seamlessness (the bit where Goddard rubs his temple along Nixon\u2019s calf I rewound to savour again).\nOn film, there\u2019s no doubt that narrative is an easier sell than thematic or abstract dance, which demands a commitment from the viewer that we\u2019re not in the habit of giving to the small screen. Without the excitement of being at a live event, weaknesses of choreography or concept are more exposed \u2013 you can sometimes feel the lack of a single, driving vision in the collective nature of NMC\u2019s work. But whether it\u2019s a document or a standalone work (jury\u2019s out), there are still rewards to be found by delving into the archive. At least until the chance to be choreographed by robots comes around.\n New Movement Collective\u2019s previous works are available online.",

        "content": "The SPFL wanted clubs to end the season but Dundee\u2019s missing vote has resulted in the game\u2019s governing body being questioned\nScottish football does not have a monopoly on toxicity. At times like these it just feels that way. In a period when serious discussions should be taking place about the recalibration of football post-pandemic open warfare has broken out. People with involvement spanning decades admit they have not encountered anything quite like the past few days.\nWhen the chairman of the Scottish Professional Football League rounded on \u201cdamaging misinformation\u201d in the media he had a cheek. The SPFL\u2019s reputation has been damaged, all right to the point of laughing stock by a voting farce which barely feels believable.\nThe league\u2019s board stands accused by the owner of a major club of exerting undue influence. Another club wants the SPFL\u2019s chief executive and legal advisor suspended. The SPFL has routinely been harmed by thousands belting out verses from a sectarian hit parade on live television and missiles from the stands resulting in no proper sanction at all.\nThis body has no title sponsor for next season, a television deal \u2013 plus plenty more \u2013 beholden to one fixture, an annual split which distorts the fundamentals of league football and has been a recurring on-field laughing stock beyond its own border for years.\nIf Murdoch MacLennan believes the media has tarnished what he presides over one wonders about his sense of perspective on the weekend his league deemed it acceptable to release results of an incomplete vote.\nDundee haven\u2019t enjoyed, if that is the appropriate term, as much time in the limelight since they were jousting with Milan in the 1962-63 European Cup semi-finals. In the context of 2019-20, the Dens Park club has become embroiled in an almighty and unsatisfactory mess; about which, three days later, they remain conspicuously silent.\nThe earlier chain of events would have rocket scientists scratching their heads. After weeks of background talks, clubs were hastily delivered with a proposal that would close and call the campaign. Despite glaring fixture imbalances, average points per game \u2013 as never heard of before \u2013 would be implemented. The top flight planned to delay an announcement of Celtic as champions and relegation for Hearts until they could tickle Uefa\u2019s tummy on 23 April. Finance was mooted as key; define league placings, issue more than \u00a39m of prize money deemed vital during coronavirus.\nThe SPFL has told clubs of its anxiety to be in a position to start the new season on the first weekend of August as per a new contract with Sky. An early April letter from the Scottish government to the SPFL curiously states \u201cbased on the specialist advice you received it would be likely to take around six weeks of group training and conditioning before players are ready to safely play SPFL fixtures again\u201d. Season 2018-19 ended on 19 May, with Rangers playing in the Europa League on 9 July; after a close-season break.\nClubs had guidance to deliver votes by Friday; 75 per cent in the top flight, 75 per cent in the Championship and 75 per cent in Leagues One and Two combined would pass the resolution. It exposes a woeful governance structure that Albion Rovers and Cowdenbeath have influence on outcomes for Celtic and Hearts and vice versa.\nBy an uncanny quirk, three clubs represented on the SPFL board would appear to benefit from a yes vote; Motherwell to the tune of third in the Premiership, Hamilton in respect of guaranteed safety and Brechin \u2013 this is the most extraordinary aspect \u2013 spared a relegation play-off when rooted at the bottom of League Two.\nRangers have a man on the SPFL board but in a football sense are in the rare position of having precious little to lose nor gain with the league being abandoned; it hasn\u2019t prevented a row of epic proportions with the league.\nDundee\u2019s vote, a key one, was missing as the SPFL took the unprecedented step of telling the public how 39 of 42 clubs had voted on Friday evening. By Saturday Inverness chief executive Scot Gardiner confirmed a \u201cNo\u201d ballot paper, signed and dated by Dundee\u2019s managing director, was valid as circulated around fellow clubs.\nMacLennan\u2019s explanation, 24 hours later, insisted Dundee \u201cattempted to submit a voting slip, which did not reach the SPFL until late that evening\u201d. The league chairman added: \u201cEarlier, at 6pm on Friday, that club had confirmed in writing to the SPFL that any attempted vote from that club should not be considered as cast.\u201d So there we have it; Dundee somehow knew their vote wasn\u2019t going to land imminently and, in the meantime, asked the league to disregard it anyway.\nIt is perfectly plausible that an electronic firewall blocked Dundee\u2019s email. Far more concerning is the as yet unexplained events and communications that caused the club to back off from its casting. Dundee were obliged \u2013 by everyone apart from the SPFL \u2013 to resubmit precisely the same paper. In not doing so, and somehow being cast as kingmakers, Dundee and the SPFL have fatally undermined the outcome of this resolution. It simply cannot be taken seriously.\nThe SPFL\u2019s desperation to have the resolution passed was laid bare last week. \u201cThe alternative is further weeks, and possibly months, of uncertainty and financial hardship for dozens of clubs which are desperately looking for a way to survive,\u201d said a spokesman. This language appeared needlessly aggressive, even before the Hearts owner, Ann Budge, raised the question of \u201cwhether the board is attempting to unduly influence the members\u2019 decision-making process\u201d. Clubs are, surely, allowed to vote as they see fit.\nRangers\u2019 central grievance, never understated, relates to evidence in their possession which they allege \u201craises serious concerns surrounding the SPFL\u2019s processes relating to its stewardship of the voting on the resolution presented to member clubs\u201d.\nMacLennan has compelled Rangers to hand over said paperwork. On the face of it, not unreasonably, the Ibrox club don\u2019t want to furnish the very people they are complaining about with information. Rangers\u2019 problem relates to what their alternative is. If the league are absolutely adamant there have been no dark arts they should call Rangers\u2019 bluff and convene an independent investigation.\nRangers also failed with an initiation of a resolution aimed at releasing end-of-season funds to SPFL clubs. A Rangers spokesman said on Sunday that \u201cthe SPFL board already has the authority to provide loans to member clubs\u201d. Such a principle questions the league\u2019s position on \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d given that the prize money is already in its bank accounts.\nCeltic are in an invidious position albeit a rump of their support, casting aspersions at Rangers\u2019 broadsides, are specialists in railing against Scottish football officialdom. This discord for now has nothing to do with Celtic, spare a wish to have a ninth title in succession confirmed at some point and the recurring suspicion of Scotland\u2019s dominant force exerting too much influence at the game\u2019s summit.\nThat Rangers don\u2019t want Celtic\u2019s retention of the trophy nailed down is as obvious as Tuesday follows Monday; it may be that a sufficient racket has been made for any title celebrations to be laughed off anyway.\nWe are entitled to act similarly. Calm heads, sensible decision-making and working for a greater good has never been so vital nor so absent.",

That is why I am announcing the strict lockdown will continue until Monday 11 May.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate the effort I am asking of you,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is new hope but nothing is won at the moment \u2026 the epidemic is not under control.\u201d\nIt was Macron\u2019s fourth televised address since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis and expectations were high, not just that he would make concrete announcements but that he would give some direction and reassurance.\nHospital admissions and death rates appear to have levelled off \u2013 though as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of France\u2019s health authority, has repeated, they remain at a \u201chigh level\u201d \u2013 and the French were keen to know if and when the four-week lockdown restrictions may be eased.\nIn a 30-minute speech marked by a tone of humility, Macron gave an explanation, a response and a calendar for the next few weeks.\nHe admitted several times that there had been failings in dealing with the pandemic, particularly with the lack of masks and equipment, but promised that by 11 May there would be enough tests for \u201cthe elderly, health workers and the most vulnerable\u201d and masks for everyone.\n\u201cWere we prepared? No. Clearly not enough. There were failings, there was a lack of material,\u201d he said.\nMacron added that the coming four weeks would be used to obtain more tests, masks and equipment, and organise financial aid not only for businesses but for those families in a precarious situation.\n\u201cThese are difficult days and we are now feeling afraid and anxious for our parents and ourselves,\u201d Macron said.\nFrom 11 May, creches, schools, colleges and lyc\u00e9es will be \u201cprogressively opened\u201d as a priority, he said.\n\u201cMany children are missing out of school and there is an inequality in that there are those who don\u2019t have access to the internet and can\u2019t be helped by their parents.\u201d\nWhile schools will open from 11 May, Macrons said restaurants, cafes, hotels, museums and cultural sites must stay closed and large festivals and events may only be allowed after mid-July.\nMacron made reference to EU solidarity and the need to support African countries, including the possibility of cancelling their debt.\nHe said France\u2019s borders with non-EU countries would remain closed. This is not thought to include the UK, as Britain is still in the Brexit transition period.\nHe concluded: \u201cWe have to reinvent ourselves, and me first of all \u2026 We are vulnerable. When can we hope for an end to this? I understand you have many questions and I would like to answer all of them. But I say in all humility, we don\u2019t have definitive answers today.\n\u201cWe will share with you what we know and what we don\u2019t know, we will come out of this, but we still have several months of living with this virus.\u201d\nMacron added: \u201cTake care of yourselves and each other and we will get through this.\u201d",

Plus, the government expects unemployment to double\nGood morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 14 April.\nAustralian police have been criticised for interrupting a funeral while enforcing social distancing rules over Easter weekend. Helen Kolovos, who buried her father on Saturday, says she was \u201cinconsolable\u201d after two officers began counting the number of people attending the funeral as her father\u2019s coffin was carried down the aisle. The news came amid an increase in fines for breaching public health orders, as the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was \u201cnow seeing consolidation of the flattening of the curve\u201d after new cases continued to grow less than 2% a day. Meanwhile, a Guardian Essential poll has found that Australians are just as happy as they were before the lockdown measures came into place, despite worries about the economy.\nThe federal government is bracing for 10% unemployment when jobless figures for the June quarter are released, almost twice the level of 5.1% recorded in February before the fight against the coronavirus closed businesses and pushed workers out of jobs. But the government is already is arguing the jobs disaster for the three months to June could have been more like 15%. The only thing stopping this was the $130bn jobkeeper scheme passed by parliament last week to subsidise the wages of staff kept in employment. The shock workforce deterioration will be foreshadowed by the latest figures for the March quarter to be released this week. It comes as an academic tax expert warns tax reform, including a GST increase and higher land tax, will be needed to avoid the debt burden of the $214bn Covid-19 economic response falling on young people.\nNew York governor Andrew Cuomo has spoken of the \u201chorrific level of pain and grief and sorrow\u201d as deaths in the state exceeded 10,000. New York lost 671 patients to coronavirus yesterday, as Cuomo told reporters there would be no single moment when coronavirus would be defeated despite being confident \u201cthe worst was over\u201d. The White House has denied Trump was planning to fire the popular health expert Dr Anthony Fauci, after the president retweeted a message that called for Fauci\u2019s removal. Trump\u2019s rambling press conferences and tweets have popularised numerous conspiracy theories during the Covid-19 crisis. A recent Pew Research report shows that almost a third of Americans believe the virus was created in a lab.\nThe UK government is under increasing pressure over its Covid-19 response after it was revealed it missed three chances to be part of an EU scheme to bulk-buy PPE. The development comes as anger grows over PPE shortages in Britain, with stocks of full-sleeve gowns running out and plans to buy thousands of ventilators from a group including the Red Bull Formula One team now scrapped. Spanish authorities were able to relax lockdown rules as the country began to show a modest flattening of infection and death rates. Italy has seen a similar reduction in deaths and infections, but the death toll in the worst-hit country in Europe is now over 20,000.\nAustralian researchers have found a way to safely \u201csplit\u201d ventilators so a single machine can be used by multiple patients.

Some are refusing shifts out of concern for their health.\nBHP confirmed on Friday that a Rockhampton-based worker at the BHP-Mitsubishi Alliance Blackwater mine had tested positive for Covid-19. He was last at the mine site on 1 April.\nAnne Baker, the mayor of the Isaac Regional Council, which covers the northern section of the Bowen Basin, said isolated resources communities would be devastated by any potential outbreak.\nBaker said the situation was also a risk to mine operators, who would be forced to cease operations if workers on site became infected.\n\u201cFor weeks now we have been calling on [Queensland] government to implement tighter restrictions on mass movements of workers coming into region,\u201d Baker said.\n\u201cConfirmed community transmission is too late to trigger stronger action.\n\u201cOur regional health system, the critical resources industry and our hard-working communities will all be devastated by an outbreak in our regional areas where mining continues to underpin the national economy.\u201d\n\u201cGet them into our region healthy and safely, and keep them here longer as has been adopted within resources industry in other states.\u201d\n It is understood the infected mineworker travelled from Rockhampton to Blackwater and back by bus during his last roster period, returning on 1 April. Any colleagues who had potential contact with the man have been placed into isolation as a precaution.\nBHP said in a statement that the worker\u2019s diagnosis was due to the successful operation of screening processes for remote workers before they return to mine sites. It said strict social distancing, hygiene and cleaning practices were in place at the mine.\nThe CFMEU mining and energy division\u2019s Queensland president Stephen Smyth has raised concerns about \u201cmultiple points of potential cross-contamination\u201d, including on machinery, transport to mine sites, mess facilities and camp accommodation.\n \u201cWorkers across the whole operation needed reassurance that all of these risks have been identified, that they are being managed, and that all potential exposure will be appropriately tracked,\u201d Smyth said.\nThe Queensland government this month closed its borders to non-essential fly-in workers, but large numbers continue to cycle through communities from Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton.\nAmong miners, the situation has exposed a schism dividing many of those who base themselves in nearby communities and those who live remotely and stay in camps during their roster periods.\nMany locals are fearful of the impact of any coronavirus outbreak in a remote location and want the regular stream of fly-in and drive-in workers stopped.\nIn Moranbah, for instance, there are seven hospital beds, two ventilators and no intensive care unit. A local GP, Margaret Swenson, told the ABC last week that if coronavirus spread to work camps \u201cthen we\u2019re in real strife\u201d.\nA drive-in, drive-out worker based at Mackay told Guardian Australia he was considering declining future work over concerns about incidental contamination on transport to mine sites.\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen the mining companies are going so far out of their way to keep people doing the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they have stopped 99% of contacts. But I still look around every time and think, if one bugger has the virus then there\u2019s no way they can do anything to stop more people getting it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to get heated too, some of the stuff that\u2019s said to [drive-in, drive-out] guys, or some of the stuff you read on social media. There\u2019s always a bit of a divide between the two groups but it\u2019s almost nasty. If one person does the wrong thing then we\u2019ll all be blamed.\u201d\nBaker said the solution was to drastically reduce movements of people by seeking to house remote workers in mining communities for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cIt will be hard for workers to live away for extended periods of time, however this may be a small price to keep families safe, workers employed and doing their essential role to support an economy desperate for productivity,\u201d Baker said.\n\u201cWe must keep the mines open and people in jobs, but not at the expense of lives.\u201d",

The value of non-performing loans rose at the fastest pace since September 2009, with a somewhat slower increase expected over the coming quarter.\nA jump in bad debts could be worrying for banks, which are on the frontline of the Treasury\u2019s coronavirus rescue plans. Those plans include doling out up to \u00a3330bn worth of cheap loans to businesses affected by the outbreak. While the government has pledged to cover 80% of losses if borrowers default, banks are still on the hook for the remaining sums. Bank margins are also expected to be squeezed even further, as banks cover the arrangement fees for the government loans.\nThe survey also showed that the outlook for the financial sector had deteriorated sharply, as the economy heads into a deep recession. Just 12% of firms were more optimistic about overall business conditions compared to three months earlier, while 53% were negative about future prospects, resulting in a balance of -41%.\nWhile some firms expect to increase spending on IT, overall investment is expected to drop due in part to uncertainty about business demand over the months ahead.\nThe CBI\u2019s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, said: \u201cThe bulk of the survey took place before social distancing measures were ramped up, but there were already signs of the Covid-19 pandemic leaving its mark. Expectations for business volumes and headcount weakened, non-performing loans rose sharply and financial firms are planning heavy cuts to investment in the year ahead.\n\u201cFinancial services are already playing an essential role in helping companies with their cashflow, through channelling funds from the government\u2019s support schemes. But like other businesses, they\u2019ve also been struck by staff shortages and changes to how they operate.\u201d\nWhile about 30% of financial services firms said they had hired more staff, 39% reported a drop in headcount, resulting in a score of -9%, which was the fastest decline in employment in a year.",

Although no formal exception was published, local defence officials who facilitated the flight were later able to confirm the shortened quarantine period.\nAttempts to discover why the change was made, and whether the seven-day requirement remained in place generally were unsuccessful.\n  World Health Organization guidelines suggest the virus can live on plastics and other packaging materials for hours or days. It recommends treatment of potentially infected surfaces with common disinfectants.\n  Dr Christopher Bartlett, an independent climate change expert who was stranded in the remote western part of Espiritu Santo Island by Vanuatu\u2019s Covid-19 domestic travel ban, has accompanied local government officials in visits to dozens of coastal villages where they have conducted damage assessments.\n  \u201cIt was like a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire landscape was transformed.\u201d\n  In one village, he said, two small children emerged from the ruins of their house and asked their parents if they\u2019d been transported to a different land.\n\n Bartlett was able to coordinate with provincial authorities to deal with urgent medical matters. Two children suffered multiple fractures when their house collapsed on them. They had been untreated for days when he found them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an immediate need for relief, especially for shelter. Hours, days matter. People are sleeping in the ruins,\u201d said Bartlett.\n \u201cPlaces have changed beyond recognition,\u201d said Andrew Gray, a secondary school science teacher on Pentecost Island. \u201cIn the short term, food is rotting in gardens because paths everywhere are blocked by fallen trees. In the medium-term people know that the government will send aid.\u201d\nAdditional quarantine restrictions have created a lag in a response where conditions in affected areas are the worst in living memory.\n Covid-19 seems to have dried up charitable donations, too. \u201cWithin 72 hours of [Cyclone] Pam, we had AU$7m [in donations]\u201d, said World Vision country manager Kendra Gates Derousseau. \u201cIf we crest $1m at the end of this week, we\u2019ll have done a good job.\u201d\n Caretaker deputy prime minister Jotham Napat, who was chair of the national disaster committee during Cyclone Pam, has repeatedly expressed concern that delays could cost lives. Assistance is needed, and urgently, he wrote on Facebook last week.\n \u201cWe need logistics, food and shelter, and we know and are grateful for our friends and neighbours who have already committed much needed support.\u201d\n Days later when a third death was reported, he struck out, writing \u201cAnother life lost ... please advise as to why we are unable to save this life. Was it because we were too slow to act? We need some explanation or I will ask the director and [director general] NDMO to voluntarily resign or we will find a way to remove them for incompetence.\u201d",

        "content": "News Corp says acquitted cardinal faces new claims over alleged incident in the 1970s when he was a priest in Ballarat\nCardinal George Pell is being investigated by police over a new allegation of child sexual abuse, according to News Corp reports.\nPell was released from jail last Tuesday after the high court acquitted him on five historical child sexual abuse charges. Pell, 78, spent more than 400 days in jail after being convicted by a jury in December 2018. The high court acquitted Pell after finding the jury should have held a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\nPell has given an exclusive interview to his longtime friend and supporter from Sky News, Andrew Bolt, which is due to air on Tuesday night.\nOn Tuesday the Herald-Sun reported that Pell was being investigated by police over an incident in the 1970s, when Pell was a priest in the Victorian town of Ballarat. The report did not suggest the allegation was true, and Pell has always vehemently denied all allegations of sexual abuse against him.\nA Victoria police spokesman said: \u201cVictoria police will not be providing any comment in relation to these allegations.\u201d\nGuardian Australia has contacted the Catholic archdiocese of Sydney for comment.\nPell\u2019s spokeswoman, Katrina Lee, was quoted by the Herald-Sun as saying: \u201cIn any police matter there should be due process through the proper channels.\u201d\nPell may also face a number of civil cases.\nIn a preview of the Pell interview released by Sky News, Bolt alluded to the possibility of new investigations and said Pell would respond to questions about Victoria police in the interview. In the preview Bolt asks Pell: \u201cHow would you react if the Victorian police were to keep trawling for victims, keep trawling for attempts to prosecute you?\u201d\nPell responds: \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprised. But who knows. That\u2019s their business.\u201d\nAt a Victoria police media conference on Tuesday afternoon, deputy commissioner Shane Patton was asked for his response to allegations police had a vendetta against Pell.\nPatton said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any comments to make at all in respect to Cardinal Pell.\u201d\nBolt wrote numerous opinion pieces in support of Pell before the criminal case had concluded.\nThe conclusion of Pell\u2019s criminal trial last week sparked renewed calls for the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, to release the redacted sections of the child sexual abuse royal commission\u2019s final report that related to Pell. The commission, which examined institutional abuse throughout Australia, published its final report in 2017 but pages relating to Pell were blanked out so as not to jeopardise his criminal case.\nHowever, a new criminal investigation may place the release of the commission report in doubt. The redacted section examines the actions of Catholic church authorities in Ballarat, including at the time when Pell was a priest in the region.\nPell was cross-examined by the commission in 2016 on what he knew about the notorious paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale, who was a friend of Pell\u2019s at the time in Ballarat. Pell responded: \u201cIt was a sad story and of not much interest to me. I had no reason to turn my mind to the evils Ridsdale had perpetrated.\u201d\nPell shared a house with Ridsdale and sat on a committee of priests who made decisions to move Ridsdale from parish to parish.\nThe comment to the commission from Pell drew the ire of Bolt at the time, who said it revealed Pell was lying about or \u201cdangerously indifferent\u201d to the abuse occurring around him.\n\u201cWhether or not he directly knew \u2013 and the case against him is circumstantial \u2013 did he actually do what was necessary for any moral person and pursue the interests of the children being abused?\u201d Bolt told Sky News at the time. \u201cAnd on that ground I think the case against him is very damning.\u201d\nBut he rowed back on those comments just one day later, stating: \u201cI feel embarrassed because I think I\u2019ve joined the pack attacking Pell.\n\u201cWhat he [Pell] seems to have said, meant to say, was that he had no reason to look at what was happening in that parish of Inglewood by Gerald Ridsdale and as a result, those things slipped his mind.\u201d\nBolt secured an exclusive interview with Pell in 2016 after Pell concluded giving evidence to the commission.\nThe Catholic archdiocese of Sydney also confirmed on Tuesday that NSW Police\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Squad visited Cardinal Pell at Good Shepherd Seminary in\n Homebush in relation to security threats.\n The NSW police squad\u2019s visit to the seminary is unrelated to any police investigation involving Cardinal Pell, the archdiocese said.",

Thin, white wisps of cloud sail through the blue sky. Sitting in our small walled garden, I close my eyes and focus my hearing on the sounds around me, scanning each, one by one, in a kind of meditation. The house sparrows chirp, chirrup and chitter loudly, bad-temperedly, from the hazel bush they favour in the corner. Wings softly whirr as they fly back and forth from the branches to the feeders, to the tall alder tree outside the garden.\nLaughter floats over the walls, a child is bouncing a ball somewhere, a delivery truck passes. Jackdaws chuck as they fly over. Honeybees and bumblebees buzz as they visit the fading blooms of the dwarf cherry blossom tree beside me. Wood pigeons call softly to each other on rooftops. A blackbird warbles its pure, joy-filled song. A greenfinch rasps a slow, falling note \u2013 it isn\u2019t pretty, but it is a welcome addition to the garden soundtrack. Greenfinches have bred here in the past, but have been absent for four years, so I\u2019m glad to see them return. There\u2019s even a chiffchaff singing in the distance, somewhere on the edge of town. The lack of traffic on the nearby bypass and planes heading to Gatwick means I hear them all clearly this afternoon.\nButterflies are also appearing more on these warmer days. A male orange-tip flew through earlier, and now a large yellow male brimstone flickers randomly across the bottom of the garden, catching the light, and for a few moments it seems a broken fragment of the sun is sparkling mid-air over the grass.\nThe bright, butter-yellow male brimstones first emerge from hibernation in February, but the pale, white-green females come later, with the warmer days, their numbers reaching a peak in mid-April. They have one brood from mid-July, preferring areas where they can find their larval food plant \u2013 buckthorn, or alder buckthorn.\nThe wandering, buttery butterfly, with its distinctive scalloped, leaf-shaped wings, rises over the brick wall and disappears. I note down the birds, bumblebee and butterflies for the British Trust for Ornithology\u2019s Garden Birdwatch, and I continue to listen to birdsong as the sun disappears, leaving a soft, pale glow in the sky.",

        "content": "The crisis has brought the economy to a near halt, and left millions of people out of work. But thanks to intervention on an unprecedented scale, a full-scale meltdown has been averted \u2013 for now\nIn the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.\nOn the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201cRona rigs\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been wiped off the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.\nWhat the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is not only Europe and the US that have been shut down, but once-booming emerging market economies in Asia. Commodity exporters from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa face collapsing markets.\nIt is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. From the street hawkers of Delhi to the personal trainers of LA, the service sector \u2013 by far the most important employer in the modern economy \u2013 has been poleaxed. Never before has the global economy suffered a shock of this scale all at once. In the US alone, at least 17 million people have lost their jobs in the last three weeks. A severe global recession is now inevitable.\nThe crucial question is how much of the world economy will survive the lockdown, and this depends on the availability of credit. Business runs on credit. The bits of the economy that do continue to function \u2013 the warehouses, the mobile phone providers and internet firms \u2013 all need credit. Wage bills for those still working are financed through credit. Even greater is the need of those who are not working. If they can\u2019t get loans, bills will go unpaid, which spreads the pain. To survive the lockdown, millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit, too. Across the world we are witnessing the largest surge in deficits and government debt since the second world war.\nBut who do we borrow from? Banks, financial markets and money markets provide the financial fuel of the world economy. Normally, credit is sustained by the optimistic promise of growth. When that dissolves, you face a self-reinforcing cycle of collapsing confidence, contracting credit, unemployment and bankruptcy, which spreads a poison cloud of pessimism. Like an epidemic, if left uncontrolled, it will sweep all before it, destroying first the financially fragile and then much else besides. It is not for nothing that we speak of financial contagion.\nWhat began with the lockdown in Wuhan in January is more intense and more fast-moving than any recession we have seen before. In a matter of weeks we have been confronted with an economic outlook that is as grim as at any moment since the 1930s. But it could have been even worse. Imagine a situation in which, on top of the pain of the lockdown and the hellish scenes in hospital wards, we also face calls for austerity because the government cannot safely finance extra spending. Imagine that interest rates were surging, and the terms for credit cards, car loans and mortgages were suddenly getting stiffer. All of this may still happen. It is already happening to the weaker economies around the world. But for now at least, it has not happened in Europe and the US \u2013 even after the turbulence of March 2020, when the pandemic hit with full force.\nWhat Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. Without that, large parts of their economies would not be on life support \u2013 they would be stone dead. And our governments would be struggling with a financial crunch to boot. Maintaining the flow of credit has been the precondition for sustaining the lockdown. It is the precondition for a concerted public health response to the pandemic.\nDuring major crises, we are reminded of the fact that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. When financial markets are functioning normally, it remains in the background. But when they threaten to break down, it has the option of stepping forward to act as a lender of last resort. It can make loans, or it can buy assets from banks, funds or other businesses that are desperate for cash. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited. That means it can decide who sinks and who swims. We learned this in 2008. But 2020 has driven home the point as never before.\nThe last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. The results have been momentous. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system. We may never know what went on behind the closed doors of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England during those critical moments in March. So far, only muffled sounds of argument have reached the outside. But as the virus struck, the men and women in those three central banks held the economic survival of hundreds of millions of people and the fate of nations in their hands. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.\nThe financial markets scan the world for risk. Even the slightest disruption in the vast networks of finance, production and trade offers the opportunity for profit or the threat of loss. So the news on 23 January, that the outbreak of an unknown virus was serious enough for the Chinese authorities to impose a gigantic quarantine, hit the traders on their Bloomberg terminals hard. Bank economists struggled to get a grip on the dimensions of the problem. Would this be a minor disruption like Sars in 2003? Or were we facing the nightmare scenario of the Hollywood film Contagion?\nIn late January, investors began to move more and more money out of things like commodities and shares in companies, and into the relative safety of government bonds. What comforted them was the idea that the virus was a problem contained in China. The day that illusion burst \u2013 the day that investors realised that Covid-19 was becoming a global pandemic \u2013 was Monday 24 February. Over the weekend the Italian government had announced that it was imposing a quarantine in parts of northern Italy. It was the first place in the west to do so.\nEver since the financial crisis of 2008, Italy\u2019s economy had been stagnating. Both its banks and its public finances were in a precarious state. Italy\u2019s debt levels were high enough to cause bond markets to periodically panic. Now the country would become the frontline in the virus fight. The coronavirus would test the solidarity of the eurozone at its weakest link.\nAt this point, not everyone was taking the threat seriously. The caseload in the US still looked tiny. Donald Trump dismissed the virus as a \u201cscare\u201d. But investors were now seriously worried. Over the week that began on 24 February, America\u2019s main stock market index, the S&P 500, lost 10% of its value. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, was concerned enough to signal that he would soon be bringing forward a cut in interest rates, in order to stimulate consumption and investment. It was a conventional reaction, but Covid-19 was no longer looking like a conventional threat.\nBy early March, whatever complacency had prevailed was long gone. The death toll in northern Italy was rising into the hundreds and it was only a matter of time before the government in Rome would be forced to declare a nationwide lockdown.\nInvestors around the world started to panic. In times of uncertainty, they want safe-haven assets. What makes a government bond a safe investment is not only the financial standing of the borrower, but the depth of the market in which lenders can sell them if they want to get their money back sooner. There is no deeper market than that for US Treasuries, as US government bonds are known. The greater the demand for safety, the lower the interest rate the US government generally has to pay to borrow. In the first week of March, those rates were at record lows.\nFor the rest of the world economy, this run to safety was an alarming signal. One sector that knew it was heading for trouble was oil. When the global economy slows, so does the demand for energy. The oil industry of the 21st century consists, on the one hand, of large, state-controlled producers \u2013 above all the Opec group dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 and, on the other hand, of the US\u2019s upstart fracking industry. To match falling demand for oil, the Saudis wanted to cut overall production and thus prop up the price. For this they needed the agreement of the other big producers, but Russia refused to go along with them. As Moscow saw it, cutting production with a view to propping up prices was an invitation to American shale producers to fill the gap. If the politics of climate change meant that the future really would bring a transition away from fossil fuel, winning the end game involved seizing as much of the market as possible for as long as oil was being pumped. So Russia decided not to cut production, but to launch a price war. Not wanting to be outdone, over the weekend of 7-8 March, Saudi Arabia took up the challenge. It announced that it would be maximising production and discounting its prices.\nOn Monday 9 March, as markets opened, oil prices plummeted. The benchmark Brent crude fell 24% by the end of trading. By the end of the month its value had halved. From the point of view of the financial markets, the ferocity of the competition in the oil industry was a harbinger of things to come. Falling demand would force industry after industry to either slash prices or contract production. Either way, it was bad news for profits.\nWhen trading opened on Wall Street that morning, the situation was so dire that the circuit-breakers \u2013 automatic stops to trading that are triggered when prices fall by a certain amount \u2013 were soon activated. This was supposed to slow a wild selloff. But it sent a message of panic. As soon as trading resumed, everything sold.\nA rout like the one that began on 9 March has a perverse logic. When fund managers face withdrawals from the people whose money they manage, they need cash and have to choose which assets to sell first. They might prefer to sell the riskiest investments, but those can be disposed of only for a large loss. So instead, they attempt to sell their most liquid and safe assets \u2013 government bonds. That means the prices of those bonds fall, dragging them into the maelstrom. This has the knock-on effect of unravelling a basic relationship on which many investors rely: typically, when shares go down, bonds go up, and vice versa. So to protect yourself against risk, you buy a portfolio made up of both. If everything works as it\u2019s supposed to, the swings should balance each other out. But in the panic that began on 9 March, this was no longer happening: rather than balancing out, the price of shares and bonds were collapsing together. The only thing that anyone wanted to hold was cash, and what they wanted most of all were dollars. The surging US dollar in turn spread the pressure worldwide to everyone who owed money in that currency.\nThe Fed had desperately tried to halt the run. To signal its willingness to support the economy and ease the pressure on the world economy from the strong dollar, it had brought forward an interest rate cut that had been expected for the middle of the month. But with the darkening horizon, lower interest rates did little to help. Who would borrow or invest under such circumstances? Confidence was broken. Just how badly would become clear over the following two weeks.\nIt was a cruel twist of fate that Italy was the first European country struck by the virus. Italy has a sophisticated medical system; Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, is among the richest places in the world. The weakness lies in the country\u2019s public finances. To fight the crisis, Italy needed to be spending money on public health and to support the economy during the lockdown. But would the corset of the euro give it the leeway?\nThe problem was that spending to meet the coronavirus crisis would raise Italy\u2019s public debts. The more indebted you are, the higher the price you pay to borrow. For a European government, that premium is measured by the difference, or \u201cspread\u201d, between your interest rate and that paid by Germany, the highest-ranked borrower in Europe. With its pre-crisis debt at just under 135% of GDP, Italy was perilously close to the point at which rising spreads would drive up its deficit and thus, in a vicious circle, make its debts less and less sustainable.\nTo ensure that investors stay calm, it is the job of central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. But because Italy is a member of the eurozone, it no longer has an independent national central bank that can buy its debt. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from directly buying a member country\u2019s newly issued debt. That left the Italians exposed. As the coronavirus crisis intensified in late February and investors became concerned by the prospect of greater state spending, the spread to German interest rates increased. If they rose too far, Italy would face not only a public health disaster but a financial crisis, too. What could Europe do to help?\nItaly already had reason to feel abandoned by its European partners: they had done little to help it tackle its chronic unemployment problem, or to take in the refugees arriving from north Africa. The coronavirus was a new test. The signs were not good: other member states were grudging in their reaction to Italy\u2019s appeals for help. But what really mattered, for the country\u2019s financial survival, was the stance taken by the ECB.\nUnder its former president, Mario Draghi, the ECB had emerged in the course of the last financial crisis as the pivot of the European economy. Draghi\u2019s promise to do whatever it takes to hold the eurozone together, uttered at the height of the crisis in July 2012, has become a mantra of modern economic policy. Faced with a financial panic, restoring confidence is key \u2013 and because a central bank is in charge of issuing currency, it is the only crisis-fighter with truly unlimited firepower.\nNorthern European fiscal and monetary conservatives had always been suspicious of Draghi\u2019s interventions, which they saw as a way to transfer Italy\u2019s liabilities on to Europe\u2019s balance sheet. And his final round of bond-buying, in 2019, proved particularly controversial. By the time he ended his stint at the ECB that autumn, it was all Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Berlin could do to ensure that there were no unseemly scenes at his retirement party.\nChristine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France and IMF boss, took over as head of the ECB in October 2019, and inherited Draghi\u2019s extraordinarily difficult position. Now she would have to demonstrate that she could handle a major financial crisis. The ECB press conference on 12 March was the crucial test.\nThe ECB had good news for Europe\u2019s banks: they would receive a huge amount of low-cost funding. It was also going to buy an additional \u20ac120bn in assets \u2013 although if that was spread across the members of the Eurozone, as the rules demanded, it would hardly give Italy the support it needed. But the critical moment came when Lagarde was asked a question about the ECB\u2019s attitude to sovereign debt. Her response was remarkable. \u201cWe are not here to close spreads,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the function or the mission of the ECB. There are other tools for that, and there are other actors to actually deal with those issues.\u201d\n\u201cSpreads\u201d meant Italy. And what Lagarde seemed to be saying was that it was somebody else\u2019s problem. But if the ECB wasn\u2019t going to help Italy, who would? Did it really expect the other member states of the eurozone to string together a fiscal safety net for Italy? Obviously, given the bad blood between Italy and the northern Europeans, Lagarde had to walk a fine line. But with hundreds of people dying every day, with global financial markets in a state of repressed panic, was the ECB seriously suggesting that it would wait for Berlin, Paris and Rome to settle their differences before putting out the fire? It was breathtaking.\nFor investors, Lagarde\u2019s comment came like a bolt of lightning. And within minutes, she started to backtrack. She went in front of the cameras to promise that the ECB would use the flexibility of its \u20ac120bn programme to prevent the fragmentation of the euro area \u2013 code for helping Italy. But the damage was done. The markets slumped, and the price that Italy had to pay to borrow leaped: averaged out, the spread moved by 0.65%. That may not sound like a big difference, but when applied to a mountain of debt the size of Italy\u2019s, it raises the interest bill by as much as \u20ac14bn for just one year. It was the last thing Italy needed. In a rare public rebuke, both Paris and Rome distanced themselves from the ECB. The crisis was pulling Europe further apart.\nAfter five terrifying days of market turmoil, the weekend of 14-15 March was a moment for central banks around the world to coordinate their response. What everyone wanted was dollars, so it was above all the Federal Reserve that needed to take the lead. And as its chair, Powell did. He called an unscheduled press conference for the afternoon of 15 March. What he announced was remarkable.\nWith immediate effect, the Fed was cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 something it had done just once before, at the height of the crisis in 2008. To stabilise the US Treasury bonds market, it would be buying $700bn in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. And it would start big, buying $80bn by 17 March. In the space of just 48 hours, it would spend more on treasuries than the Fed spent in most months in the aftermath of 2008.\nThese were measures for the US economy. But the coronavirus was a global problem. The flight to safety and the ensuing rise in the dollar had put pressure on everyone who had borrowed in the US currency. So, to ensure that dollars could be piped to every financial institution in every major financial centre in the world, the Fed announced that it was improving the terms on the so-called liquidity swap lines \u2013 deals by which the major central banks agree to exchange dollars for sterling, euros, swiss francs and yen in unlimited amounts.\nPowell was deploying the main weapons of the 2008 crisis with far greater speed than his predecessors ever had. But it was still not enough. When the markets opened the next day, 16 March, the fall was vertiginous. The circuit-breakers are supposed to come into effect if the market falls by more than 7%. That morning, the fall was so quick that the S&P 500 dropped by 8.1% before trading could be stopped. The so-called fear index, VIX \u2013 a measure of market volatility \u2013 surged to levels last seen in the dark days of November 2008.\nThe fear in the markets was now feeding on itself. If the Fed\u2019s magic of 2008 no longer worked, then what would?\nThe foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded, is the biggest market in the world. And the place where the most transactions are booked is the City of London. On an average day, transactions back and forth total $6.6tn. But on Wednesday 18 March, there was only one trade: people wanted to sell everything. The only thing they wanted to buy were dollars. Every other currency was falling.\nThe central banks\u2019 failure to calm the markets had set the stage for the worst days of the panic. Coronavirus cases were piling up in Europe more rapidly than at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Hedge funds were placing multi-billion-dollar bets that the recession in Europe would be protracted. Blue chip companies like Apple were facing stiff premiums to borrow for as little as three months ahead. Even gold, a classic safe haven, was selling.\nThat Wednesday, on his third day as governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey organised a press conference in an effort at reassurance. But as he was speaking, sterling plunged by 5% to its lowest level since 1985. Meanwhile, the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts \u2013 the oldest major asset market in the world \u2013 was witnessing unprecedented turmoil. It was, in Bailey\u2019s understated phrasing, \u201cbordering on the disorderly\u201d.\nIn response, the Bank of England monetary policy committee met the next day in emergency session and announced that the Bank would be buying \u00a3200bn in gilts. Unlike in 2008, it would not be doing so on a prearranged schedule. As Bailey explained: \u201cWe will act in the markets promptly and rapidly as we see appropriate.\u201d This was no time for timetables. The central bank was, by its own admission, flying by the seat of its pants.\nOn an emergency conference call on the evening of 18 March, the ECB executive board decided that it, too, needed to act. Under a pandemic emergency purchase programme, it announced that it would begin by buying \u20ac750bn of government and corporate debt. But the ECB was willing to go even further than that. It said that, if necessary, it would revise some of its \u201cself-imposed limits\u201d.\nFor an institution as hidebound as the ECB, this amounted to a revolution. Self-imposed limits \u2013 inflation targets, rules on which European government\u2019s debt it could buy and in what quantities \u2013 are what the ECB lives by. It is clear that conservative members of the bank\u2019s governing council continued to resist such a move. But in the end it was the turmoil in the markets that decided the issue. The ECB needed to send a signal of determination. If Lagarde had fluffed her \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment, the ECB was now at least promising to do whatever was necessary.\nBy the end of the third week of March, 39 central banks around the world, from Mongolia to Trinidad, had lowered interest rates, eased banking regulations and set up special lending facilities. To ease the pressure on emerging markets, the Fed widened the network of liquidity swap lines to cover 14 major economies including Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. This was a remarkable wave of activism. But the pandemic itself was only beginning to bite. Central banks could cushion the financial shock, but not address the actual economic implosion, let alone the health crisis.\nEuropean governments had been quick to move. Germany had thrown aside its fiscal caution and was committed to a gigantic programme of government guarantees for business lending. But this made all the more glaring the gap to Italy and Spain, which were not only hardest hit by the virus, but also constrained by the financial legacy of the eurozone crisis. They did not want to risk sliding back into a debt crisis.\nIn the US, the Fed had leaped into action. But where were the politicians? Congress was distracted by the upcoming presidential election. What was needed was an unprecedented rescue package for an economy in freefall. How were Republicans and Democrats to reconcile fundamental differences over health care and unemployment insurance, or the notorious cronyism of the president and his clan? Since the Democrats had won control of the House of Representatives in 2018, legislation had been largely paralysed. Now, in the face of a tsunami of job losses, the two parties had to come to an agreement.\nAs trading began in Asia early on the morning of Monday 23 March, the news from Washington made it clear that there had been no deal on Capitol Hill. The futures markets plunged so violently that circuit breakers were activated again \u2013 by now this had happened an unprecedented five times in two weeks. If it wanted to avoid a meltdown when Wall Street opened, the Fed would have to make another move.\nUntil this point, Jerome Powell had been moving in the shadow of his predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who had been Fed chair in 2008. But by 23 March, Powell had activated all the basic elements of the 2008 repertoire \u2013 slashing interest rates, using quantitative easing, supporting money markets. But it had not worked, partly because it could not reach the source of the crisis itself \u2013 that is, the virus and the lockdown \u2013 and also because it was not reaching the bit of the credit system that was most vulnerable in 2020: the borrowing by big corporations.\nThe Fed has always steered clear of corporate debt, which it considered politically sensitive. If you bought debt from individual firms, you were vulnerable to accusations of favouritism. If you bought a cross-section of debt you ended up holding many very poor-quality loans. But by the early hours of 23 March, it was clear that something had to be done to stabilise the corporate debt market. Since 2008, bonds issued by non-financial corporations have surged from $3.3tn to more than $6.5tn. If their value fell too far, US corporations would not only face shutdowns and a complete loss of revenue, but also a crippling credit squeeze.\nIdeally, the Fed would have made a grand announcement in conjunction with a Congressional stimulus package. But by the evening of 22 March, it was clear that the package being proposed by the Republicans was unacceptable to the Democrats. It might take days for them to square the difference. The financial markets would not wait.\nOn 23 March, 90 minutes before markets opened, Powell made his move. He announced that the Fed was setting up legal entities \u2013 off the books of the Fed, but guaranteed by it \u2013 that would have the capacity to buy highly rated corporate debt, or at least any debt that the ratings agencies were still willing to declare investment-grade. In effect, the Fed was establishing itself as the backstop to the trillion-dollar corporate bond market. The Fed ramped up its asset-purchase programme, to an astonishing $375bn in Treasury securities and $250bn in mortgage securities in a single week.\nIt was an extraordinary move to widen the scope of central bank intervention into the corporate economy. And it was understood as such by the markets. Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, as well as the FTSE 100, had lost 30% of their value. That day, they began to recover.\nTwo days later, on 25 March, backing arrived from Congress when the Senate passed its giant package of $2tn \u2013 more than twice the size of the stimulus bill passed in 2009. It provided funds to top up unemployment insurance, to support small businesses and the US\u2019s privatised hospital system. Crucially, it also set aside $454bn to cover Fed losses. Since most loans would not be expected to go bad, this would enable the Fed to make more than $4tn in loans, if necessary.\nIn the US, the public health campaign against the virus was still a shambles. But as far as economic policy was concerned, the full power of the American state was now being deployed behind the emergency programme. And the Fed was also acting as a provider of dollar liquidity to the world economy. In the UK, too, the Treasury and the Bank of England were working closely to link the huge increase in government spending to efforts to stabilise financial markets.\nBut in the eurozone, that kind of coordination was lacking. The ECB had managed to stop the immediate panic. Yet there was still the question of whether the member states could come up with a financial plan to support their hardest-hit neighbours, Italy and Spain. The obvious solution was to issue debt jointly to fight the crisis together \u2013 an idea raised repeatedly during the eurozone crisis, when it had been bitterly resisted by a conservative northern European coalition led by Germany. This would ensure that Italy was not constrained by its pre-existing financial weakness.\nFor a coalition of nine states led by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the case was obvious. On 25 March they called for a \u201ccommon debt instrument\u201d to fund a crisis response. The ECB threw itself energetically behind the proposal. But, once again, the Netherlands and Germany refused to budge. The issue was shoved off into the Eurogroup, a meeting of the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, where the outline of a deal did finally emerge two weeks later. By then the immediate panic had passed. As Lagarde and her central banking colleagues had feared from the outset, it was on their shoulders that the stability of the eurozone continued to rest.\nWill the massive financial firewalls built by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic be enough to withstand the bad news that is headed our way over the coming weeks and months? It is too early to tell. But the first test came on Thursday 26 March, when the US Department of Labor announced that, in a single week, 3.3 million Americans had signed on for unemployment insurance. It was completely unprecedented. A graph stretching back half a century simply turns upwards in a vertical surge. In the next two weeks, another 13.5 million people would be added to the insurance rolls. And there was no end in sight. America is on pace for national unemployment to reach 30% by the summer \u2013 greater than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nThe shutdown spelled disaster for millions of American families, at least half of whom have no financial reserves to speak of, and for businesses up and down the land. How would the markets react? Astonishingly, they ended 26 March up 5%. The largest surge in unemployment ever recorded in history was met with a relaxed shrug.\nWhy weren\u2019t investors more terrified? Because the scale of Congressional stimulus made clear that, no matter how divided American politics were, that wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of a huge surge of spending. And the Fed, for its part, would make sure that the huge flow of new debt was absorbed, if necessary on to its own accounts. The private credit system, the government budget and the balance sheet of the Fed were welded together in a closed loop.\nWhat the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB managed to do in March was prevent the damage caused by the shutdown being made even worse by an immediate collapse of corporate credit. At the same time, by stabilising sovereign debt markets, they have enabled a huge surge in public spending to fight the crisis and cushion its social and economic side effects. To do this they have both widened the safety net to parts of the financial system never before protected, and intervened on a scale far greater even than in 2008.\nIn the final days of March, the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $83bn per day, or just shy of $1m per second. On 9 April, at the same moment as the latest horrifying unemployment numbers were released, it announced another $2.3tn in support targeted specifically at municipal debt and lower-grade corporate debt. That same day, the Bank of England adopted an even more radical approach. Rather than going through the process of having the Treasury issue debt that would then be bought by the central bank, it announced that it would be offering direct monetary finance to the government, to provide it with whatever funding it needed. This would be temporary, but it was still a radical move. The government\u2019s current account at the Bank of England would be repurposed to allow, if necessary, tens of billions of pounds in coronavirus spending. The last time the British government resorted to this mechanism was at the height of the crisis in 2008.\nWhat we have seen in the financial system, over the past few weeks, is a victory of sorts \u2013 but it is a defensive one. Once again, we are propping up a fragile, profit-driven system to avoid something even worse. It is also a victory limited in scope.\nBy flattening the curve of financial panic, the central banks of advanced economies have managed to ensure that life under the lockdown is not made even more unbearable by the shutting off of credit to business and households. They have also ensured that the public health response to Covid-19 can proceed at any scale that is required. Within Europe, there are questions about the differences between eurozone members: Germany has been able to deliver a conspicuously larger fiscal response to the crisis than have Italy or Spain. But those inequalities pale next to the problems facing much of the rest of the world. There the crucial supply of credit is being cut off even before coronavirus cases begin to mount, meaning, once again we have confirmed that the global financial system is hierarchical. At the apex stands the US Federal Reserve. The ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and their advanced-economy counterparts all enjoy the Fed\u2019s direct support. Thanks in no small part to that support, the advanced-economy central banks enjoy great latitude in propping up their credit systems. They might face moderate movements in their currency\u2019s exchange rate, but no devastating financial squeeze.\nThat is what the emerging-market economies have been suffering since February. Covid-19 is hitting every part of the world economy. The World Bank is warning of a devastating setback to the economies of Nigeria, Angola and South Africa, along with the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Almost half the countries in the world \u2013 more than 90 so far \u2013 have been forced to apply to the IMF for financial assistance.\nIf flattening the curve in Europe and the US was the battle of March, the next challenge is to reduce the shockwaves radiating out to the rest of the world. The last few weeks have seen a remarkable display of technocratic energy and imagination in western financial centres. That same level of commitment now needs to be brought to bear in supporting the rest of the world. We cannot control the epidemic or restore the world economy without it.\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

        "content": "Russian president suggests army could be drafted in as China also sounds alarm at cross-border cases\nThe number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.\nThe country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow. The overall nationwide tally stood at 18,328 and the death toll was 148.\nPutin told officials in a video conference the situation was \u201cchanging practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better\u201d and Russia\u2019s next few weeks would be \u201cdecisive\u201d.\n\u201cWe have a lot of problems, we don\u2019t have anything especially to brag about and we definitely mustn\u2019t relax,\u201d he added.\nHe told officials they needed to \u201cconsider all scenarios for how the situation will develop, even the most complex and extraordinary\u201d.\nHis warning came as the number of global infections rose to more than 1.92 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 119,678 people around the world have died, with the highest death tolls in the US and Italy. About 450,000 people have recovered.\nThe true number of infections is likely to be higher, with suspected underreporting or limited testing in some countries. President Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus has made the claim of zero infections or danger from the virus.\nIn the video conference, Putin called for measures to end shortages of protective equipment for medics and added that Russia would also bring in the defence ministry to help if necessary.\nChina has also voiced concern about spread of the virus in Russia.\nWhile China\u2019s daily reported infection rate remains far below its peak during the pandemic, the majority of new cases have been in regions bordering its northern neighbour. The area has become the new focus of containment measures, with some lockdown measures brought in for the cities of Hubin and Suifenhe.\nOn Monday, China\u2019s national health commission reported 79 of the 89 new imported cases were in Heilongjiang province. They were all Chinese citizens travelling home from Russia, state media said on Tuesday.\n\u201cRussia is the latest example of a failure to control imported cases and can serve as a warning to others,\u201d said the state-owned English-language Global Times in an editorial.\n\u201cThe Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country \u2026 This should sound the alarm: China must strictly prevent the inflow of cases and avoid a second outbreak.\u201d\nChina last week closed one of the last remaining land borders with Russia, in Suifenhe. Russia had already stopped flights to China and closed its land borders to incoming traffic in late January and early February.\nIn the US, President Donald Trump repeated his threat to withhold funding from the World Health Organisation.\nIn a bizarre and combative press conference, which some journalists labelled \u201cNorth Korea style\u201d, the US president played video clips of state governors praising him and wrongly claimed he had the \u201cultimate authority\u201d to reopen the country and scale back distancing measures. Trump said the country would learn soon if he had decided to reopen the economy on 1 May.\nHe refused to admit any mistakes in his government\u2019s virus response, amid continuing fallout over a New York Times investigation which revealed how little was done by Trump and his administration when they had time to prepare for the arrival of the virus in January and February.\nMore than 23,000 Americans have died. The director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, said the US was nearing its peak.\nOfficials around the world have warned that halting quarantine and social-distancing measures could undo the hard-earned progress against the disease.\nIn other developments:\nThe International Monetary Fund said on Monday it would provide immediate debt relief to 25 member countries under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) to allow them to focus more financial resources on fighting the pandemic.\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron said the country would remain in lockdown for another month and would start to reopen schools on 11 May.\nThe World Health Organization has stressed a vaccine is needed to fully halt transmission of this coronavirus, which it said is 10 times more deadly than swine flu. Its head urged caution over moves to lift lockdown conditions, saying much was still unknown about the virus and that finding, testing and isolating cases was still crucial.\nSpain has eased its restrictions, with hundreds of thousands of non-essential employees returning to work. Businesses in the construction and manufacturing sectors tentatively reopened but shops, bars and pubs will remain closed until at least 26 April.\nIn Australia police have been accused of disrespectful behaviour after entering a funeral to check social distancing rules were not being breached.\nJapan\u2019s health ministry reported 390 new cases, bringing the total to 7,645. The country has been under a state of emergency since last week but large crowds of people are still queuing for groceries and other necessities in Tokyo.\nA sailor has died onboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Almost 600 crew members have tested positive for Covid-19.\nSouth Korea, which was at one time one the largest outbreak outside of China, has just recorded its 13th day of fewer than 100 new infections. The centers for disease control and prevention said on Tuesday it had recorded 27 new cases. At least 940 of the country\u2019s total 10,564 cases were linked to passengers arriving from overseas, and mostly in the last three weeks.\nGerman experts recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions, as long as new infections stabilise and hygiene measures to control the spread of the virus are maintained, and French president, Emmanuel Macron, says cr\u00e8ches and schools will begin to reopen on 11 May. The lockdown will continue until then.",

So far, 119,687 people have died in the pandemic.\nIn a televised address, the French president said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were \u201ccivic, responsible and respected the rules\u201d \u2013 and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. He said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won.\nAs Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. Russia reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, bringing the overall nationwide tally to 18,328. Eighteen people diagnosed with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 148. In a video conference with officials on Monday, Putin said the next weeks would be \u201cdecisive\u201d for Russia\u2019s fight against the virus as the situation \u201cis changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.\u201d\nChina reported 89 new coronavirus cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. China\u2019s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day\u2019s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases.\nIn a bizarre and antagonistic press briefing that included the airing of a campaign-style video attacking the press and Trump announcing his authority over lockdown rules is \u201ctotal\u201d, the US president said he will also decide this week whether he plans to reopen the US by 1 May. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\nA glimmer of hope. Deaths and hospitalisations are falling in New York. \u201cYes, I think you can say the worst is over,\u201d governor Andrew Cuomo said, announcing an alliance with six other governors in the region to explore how to lift restrictions. \u201cIf you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we\u2019ve seen that with other places in the globe,\u201d Cuomo said.\nMonday\u2019s new cases were lower than the 530 new cases reported by the health ministry on Sunday. The country\u2019s total is 7,645. Japan was put under a state of emergency last week, but many people were still seen queuing up at grocery stores and crowding shopping arcades in parts of downtown Tokyo.\nThe debt relief will be made available under the IMF\u2019s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). About $215 million of the total will be used for grants to the first 25 countries over the next six months, with extensions possible up to two years. The first countries that will receive debt service relief from the CCRT are Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Togo and Yemen.",

Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the recovering PM, Boris Johnson, said it was \u201cabsolutely crucially important\u201d not to let up at this point. The head of the World Health Organization has urged caution over moves to lift lockdown conditions, as the global number of infections approaches 2 million. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned the situation there is getting worse rather than better, while China says its neighbour has failed to control imported cases. \u201cThe Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country,\u201d said an editorial in China\u2019s state press. To get you up to speed quickly here is our latest at-a-glance summary.\nDonald Trump has declared in a White House briefing that his \u201cauthority is total\u201d when it comes to lockdown rules during the coronavirus pandemic. The president delivered a bizarre performance in which he played a campaign video produced by White House staff \u2013 in a possible violation of election laws \u2013 that consisted of Fox News clips praising his response. Trump\u2019s assertion of sweeping powers over the states has been rejected by legal analysts as a gross misreading of the US constitution, which assures the states of autonomy. David Smith writes: \u201cA toddler threw a self-pitying tantrum on live television on Monday night. Unfortunately he was 73 years old, wearing a long red tie and running the world\u2019s most powerful country.\u201d\nThe US is nearing the peak of its outbreak, according to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield: \u201cYou\u2019ll know when you\u2019re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before.

The conclusions clash with complaints of ex-Labour whistleblowers who said there was political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn. Plans to submit the report to an Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry have been scrapped. The previous Labour leadership\u2019s handling of antisemitism allegations overshadowed parts of the 2019 election campaign.Sienna Rodgers, editor of LabourList, writes that the leak inflames factional warfare just as Starmer seeks to unite the party.\nFires nearing Chernobyl \u2013 Wildfires in Ukraine have spread to just over a mile from the Chernobyl power plant, according to activists. Ukraine\u2019s emergency services agency said 310 firefighters and dozens of fire trucks, as well as three aircraft and three helicopters, had been sent in. A Chernobyl tour operator, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, wrote that the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat: \u201cThe situation is critical. The zone is burning.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s emergency services said the fire was \u201cdifficult\u201d but called for calm and urged people not to listen to \u201capocalyptic messages \u2026 The main thing we can say is that there is no threat to the nuclear power station, the spent fuel storage, and to other critical sites in the exclusion zone.\u201d Chernobyl is the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history.\n\u2018Need you in the White House\u2019 \u2013 Bernie Sanders has endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president. Appearing with Biden in a live stream, the senator said: \u201cWe need you in the White House. We\u2019ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.\u201d\nBiden called Sanders \u201cthe most powerful voice for a fair and more just America \u2026 the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror. If I am the [Democratic] nominee \u2013 which it looks like now you just made me \u2013 I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern.\u201d In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, Sanders will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates. The pair announced their staff had set up task forces to help find common policy ground.\nSeat of his pants \u2013 A civilian passenger was launched out of the cockpit of a French fighter jet doing 500km/h after panicking and pulling the ejection lever, an investigation has found. The flight had official approval and was given to the defence company executive as a gift, but the 64-year-old was terribly nervous beforehand and pulled the lever while trying to steady himself during takeoff. He parachuted to the ground and sustained only minor injuries. The pilot was not ejected and managed to land the plane.\nGovernments in at least 25 countries are employing vast programmes for mobile data tracking, apps to record contact with others, CCTV equipped with facial recognition and drones to enforce social isolation regimes. The unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance has researchers and privacy advocates around the world worried that it may prove difficult to roll back.\nIn our science podcast, Nicola Davis speaks to Dr Andy Whittamore about the effects of Covid-19 on people with asthma and what they can do to protect themselves.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/13-44703-gnl.sci.20200414.ms.cv19_asthma.mp3\nAs of Monday in Greece there had been 2,145 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 99 deaths \u2013 far lower than elsewhere in Europe. This despite after almost a decade embroiled in a debt crisis from which the health system is by no means recovered. A rapid move to social distancing has helped, but still, the government is somewhat unexpectedly basking in the limelight of having flattened the curve, writes Helena Smith.\nIn February Germany and Britain were taking a similar approach to testing for coronavirus. But over the subsequent weeks they began to go in very different directions. Guardian health editor Sarah Boseley and Berlin bureau chief Philip Oltermann look at what happened next.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/13-76663-2020414TIFtests.mp3\nIt is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. The bits of the economy that do continue to function rely on credit to pay costs and wages. Meanwhile millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit too.\nWhat Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. During major crises, we are reminded that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited \u2013 and the last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system by the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.\nBradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish have aimed stinging criticism at British Cycling, the sport\u2019s national governing body, in a Q&A session on Instagram. Cavendish hoped to compete in the Madison in Japan and win the Olympic gold medal that has eluded him but he was not selected. Wiggins\u2019s verdict: \u201cI think it\u2019s shit, to be honest, but hey, cycling has changed so much.\u201d\nCounty cricket\u2019s defiantly low-key nature has brought joy to millions but may not save it in a looming era of belt-tightening, writes Jonathan Liew. \u201cThere were times during the gloriously sunny weekend when it was perhaps only natural to wonder how the opening day of the 2020 County Championship season was going \u2026 Instead: nothing. A whispering void.\u201d\nEwan Murray reports how Scottish football\u2019s voting farce led to open warfare breaking out: the SPFL wanted clubs to end the season but Dundee\u2019s missing vote has resulted in the game\u2019s governing body being questioned. And from Vertonghen to Cavani, there are a lot of players in Europe who do not know if they will finish the season with their clubs. Graham Searles runs through some whose contracts expire on 30 June.\nAsian stocks have bounced in early trading on hopes the coronavirus outbreak may be peaking. Chinese shares started firm with the blue-chip index up 0.7%. Australian shares were up 0.6% while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei each gained 1.4%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.2%. The pound is worth $1.256 and \u20ac1.147 at time of writing.\nAn oddly serene-sounding headline for the Telegraph\u2019s splash this morning: \u201cMinisters plan gentle path back to normal life\u201d. The Guardian has \u201cRevealed: how Britain missed three chances to bulk-buy protective kit\u201d. The Mirror composes its front page from pictures of Covid-19 victims and declares \u201cNo more\u201d as it demands protective equipment for NHS staff.\nThe Times says Britain faces \u201cLockdown for 3 more weeks\u201d. The Mail sounds the alarm over \u201cCare home catastrophe\u201d, saying almost 100 more homes had reported outbreaks in the previous 24 hours. \u201cStick with lockdown\u201d, says the Metro, citing Dominic Raab \u2013 its front-page picture is labelled \u201cOn your bikes\u201d and it shows a group of cyclists being moved on from Primrose Hill in London by a council officer.\n\u201cLockdown continues as UK not yet at virus peak\u201d, says the i. \u201cThanks for doing your Brit\u201d \u2013 the Sun relays the gratitude of England\u2019s head of nursing to everyone who stayed home over Easter.

        "content": "Tim Ecott asks fellow travel writers which books are helping them to spread their wings and escape the lockdown \u2013 in their imaginations at least\nEditor of The Faber Book of ExplorationI\u2019m rereading William Fiennes\u2019 The Snow Geese, a glorious quest by the author, who had been confined by poor health, in search of the strangely enigmatic birds. \u201cI wanted to spread my wings,\u201d he writes, and so begins his flight from his sick bed. Slowly, his journey with the migrating flocks brings him back to life. I\u2019m also enjoying Epic Continent: Adventures in the Great Stories of Europe by Nicholas Jubber. He takes us on a fascinating excursion through the epic poems that have knitted together European history, from Beowulf to the Icelandic sagas to the Odyssey, and it\u2019s compelling stuff.\nAuthor of Outpost: A Journey to the Wild Ends of the Earth\nRichard Brautigan\u2019s Sombrero Fallout is probably my favourite book; it\u2019s certainly the one I\u2019ve recommended and reread most often. Funny! Surreal! Existential! Catastrophic! Sad! At one point a librarian gets her ears shot off. The novel takes place in deserts, wastepaper baskets, the dreams of sleeping Japanese women and the apartment of a singularly humourless, moping, heartbroken writer. Every time I read it, I laugh and discover something new. In 2020, the strand of the story that focuses on the failure of government to deal with an escalating apocalypse feels prescient.\nAuthor of Tangier: From the Romans to the Rolling Stones \nI found Jonathan Raban\u2019s book Passage to Juneau profoundly comforting. He sails north along the Pacific seaboard from his home in Seattle, and along the way we learn how Kwakiutl and Tsimshian indigenous peoples navigated canoes through a foggy Inside Passage using echoes of their voices rebounding off the rocks and skerries. But it is also an internal voyage in which Raban deals with the death of his father. It is staggeringly beautiful.\nAuthor of The Lost Pianos of Siberia\nI\u2019ll devour anything Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry ever wrote on the desert. His writing takes you to places in the Sahara no one will ever go, even when we aren\u2019t in a lockdown. He was a pilot who knew how freedom felt, his descriptions of flying are the closest my imagination will ever get to soaring like a bird. That feels good at a time when I can\u2019t leave the house. His desert classic Wind, Sand and Stars speaks perfectly to these times and how we\u2019re going to have to all pull together. \u201cOnce we are bound to our brothers by a common goal that is outside us, then we can breathe. Experience teaches us that to love is not to gaze at one another but to gaze together in the same direction. There is no comradeship except through unity on the same rope, climbing towards the same peak.\u201d\nAuthor of The Immeasurable World: Journeys in Desert Places\nThe best travel writing offers not escape but connection. That\u2019s why it remains vital. What does it mean to be a stranger? What are the obligations of guest and host? T\u00e9t\u00e9-Michel Kpomassie\u2019s An African in Greenland (1981) is an absorbing bildungsroman about the Togolese author\u2019s stay on the Arctic island of Upernavik. More recently, Kapka Kassabova\u2019s To the Lake and its predecessor, Border, are lovingly crafted and meticulous tracings of the historic fault lines scarring southern Europe.\nAuthor of Around the World in 80 Trains\nThe parameters of travel writing have shifted, with traditional narratives now making way for stories from defectors and refugees for whom travel is not a whim but a matter of survival. Behrouz Boochani\u2019s No Friend But the Mountains was written by text message from an Australian detention centre on Manus Island, a brutal but beautiful piece of literature that reminds us during this time of isolation that there is always someone whose plight is worse than ours.\nAuthor of When the Last Lion Roars: The Rise and Fall of the King of the Beasts\nStories about Africa have always captured my imagination. The first travel book I ever read was Paul Theroux\u2019s Dark Star Safari and it remains my favourite. Describing his overland journey from Cairo to Cape Town, Theroux transported me to places I\u2019d never heard of. Here were new landscapes, wild animals and remarkable people \u2013 some filled with hate, others with love, but all written with such humanity. I fell in love with Africa before I\u2019d even visited it.\nAuthor of Pravda Ha Ha: True Travels to the End of Europe\nAs I travel around my room, trying to catch sight of the far horizon beyond the bedroom window, two irrepressible travellers help me to celebrate a borderless world and the forces and urges that are greater than any single one of us. First is Jay Griffiths\u2019 untameable Wild: An Elemental Journey, an exhilarating journey that pleads for the preservation of wilderness. Second is Nicolas Bouvier\u2019s The Way of the World. Bouvier \u2013 the Jack Kerouac of Switzerland \u2013 inspired a generation of young 1960s Europeans on to the road, taking me with them. He revelled in the way a journey \u2013 and a traveller\u2019s tale \u2013 can change our lives. \u201cYou think you are making a trip, but soon it is making you \u2013 or unmaking you.\u201d\nAuthor of Kings of the Yukon\nJohn McPhee\u2019s Coming Into the Country drew me to Alaska, drew me back to Alaska and made me want to write about it. McPhee\u2019s career spans dozens of books, but this is perhaps his finest, an intimate, closely observed portrait of the ways a place can shape the mentality of a people. Whether canoeing the remote Brooks Range rivers or spending months in the bush town of Eagle, it is a seemingly effortless blend of reportage, travel, nature writing and politics. There\u2019s no better writing I know on our frequently confused and conflicted relationship with the natural world.\nAuthor of Wanderland: A Search for Magic in the Landscape\nFelicity Aston\u2019s Alone in Antarctica is laden with emotion, vulnerability and humility. The way she describes the isolation, the cold and the landscape is vivid and immediate. It transcends the genre, too. Also, what she achieved was simply extraordinary \u2013 I mean 1,700km across Antarctica, alone! Her grit, her resilience, her honesty, her sheer ability to be alone with herself day after day after day inspired me no end. I plan to reread the book as a way of reminding myself that I can get through this. I know it will take me out of myself too, and I need some of that right now.Tim Ecott\u2019s latest book is The Land of Maybe: A Faroe Islands Year (Short Books, \u00a314.99)",

It ranked 108th out of 153 on the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2020 Global Gender Gap Index, while women comprise just 17% of MPs in the national assembly \u2013 well below the global average of about 25% - according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\n\u201cAlmost all male politicians, regardless of being progressive or conservative, are traditionalists when it comes to women\u2019s rights,\u201d said Lee Soo-jung, a criminology professor at Kyonggi University near Seoul, adding that some did not understand the difference between pornography and sexual crimes.\nLaunched only last month to coincide with International Women\u2019s Day, the Women\u2019s party is expected to struggle to attract votes from the two main parties \u2013 President Moon Jae-in\u2019s liberal Democratic party and the conservative United Future party \u2013 and their smaller allies, as it attempts to win four of the 47 seats being contested through proportional representation in the 300-seat assembly.\n\u201cThe two biggest parties dominate the political scene, but many diverse voices need to be heard,\u201d Kim Eun-joo, co-leader of the Women\u2019s party, told the Guardian on the eve of the election. \u201cWe\u2019re not a party for women to discuss a wide range of issues \u2013 we\u2019re about improving the lives of women, and that\u2019s why we only have a small number of campaign pledges.\u201d\nTo win a seat, the party would need to secure a minimum of 3% of the popular vote. But given that it is unlikely to attract male voters, it would probably have to win the backing of double that proportion of female voters.\n\u201cThe setting up of the Women\u2019s party is significant, but as a minor party it would be fairly difficult to tap into a broader electorate,\u201d said Chae Jin-won, a professor in politics at the Kyung Hee University in Seoul.\nChai Hyun-jung, a 33-year-old working mother in Seoul, said she had been put off by the party\u2019s sole focus on women\u2019s issues, adding she was more likely to vote for a candidate who pledged to improve early-years education and address high property prices in the capital.\n\u201cI have too many other responsibilities in my life to solely focus on gender issues,\u201d Chai said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m angry about cyber sexual violence, but I\u2019m sceptical that giving a single seat to a feminist party will actually make a noticeable difference.\u201d\nKim said the party\u2019s campaign had been held back by a ban on loudspeakers and other rules that apply only to candidates vying for proportional representation seats, and by social distancing rules imposed in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\u201cTeenagers and young women are the groups whose voices are heard least,\u201d said Kim, whose members have received death threats and had stones thrown at them during the campaign.\n\u201cSouth Korean women have been forced to put up with injustices such as digital sex crimes for years. If we put off confronting these problems until the next elections in four years\u2019 time, it will be too late.\u201d\nAgencies contributed reporting.",

Every corner of society is exposed; each one of us battling our own problems. For headteachers in England, those problems are multiplied by the anxieties of the 8.7 million children for whom they are responsible.\nThe past month has been brutal for school leaders, and we all need to act cautiously if we don\u2019t want thousands of teachers to be yet another casualty of this virus.\nIt took just nine minutes for the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to change everything. In less time than it takes to hard-boil an egg, Williamson last month told parliament that schools would \u201cclose until further notice\u201d, that national exams were cancelled, that schools would continue caring for vulnerable children, and children of keyworkers \u2013 even during the Easter holidays \u2013 and that all pupils on free meals would continue to be fed.\nHeadteachers went from running an ordinary school to organising a virtual school, a childcare centre and a food delivery service. They had two days to turn it around. Education was never the sole focus of schools, and it\u2019s a shame it has taken a pandemic to prove it.\nTen years ago, heads may have found it easier. Under Labour, education was managed by a large and well-funded Department for Children, Schools and Families \u2013 a title the Conservatives mocked for its length, and which some, such as the then education secretary, Michael Gove, disliked because it suggested schools should focus on child welfare. He wanted to get back to concentrating on discipline and academic rigour, the sort of words that get booming rounds of applause from rightwing audiences.\nHence, Gove\u2019s first act on becoming education secretary, was to change the name back to the Department for Education, and then to set fire to almost every initiative related to children\u2019s wellbeing.\nFor a decade, headteachers have felt every budget cut to children\u2019s services, and endured every slice to the cash pot for psychologists, nurses, or a school police officer. They have felt every hour they have had to spend coordinating help for a child after Children\u2019s Trusts were disbanded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d they were told, \u201cit\u2019s not your job.\u201d\nExcept, of course, it was. Cancel schools, and look: who is there for children with protection orders? Who is feeding the vulnerable? Who is writing mass bereavement policies to explain to year 4 why their teacher isn\u2019t coming back? Who is (virtually) sitting with the sobbing kid whose GCSEs have been cancelled?\nTeachers. Gove may have taken the words \u201cfamilies\u201d off the wall and decimated budgets, leaving little in the pot for welfare, but schools never gave up on helping. In families\u2019 hour of most desperate need \u2013 when the government failed to quickly deliver its national food voucher scheme, when its promise of online resources was slow and limited \u2013 school leaders stepped in to make these things happen.\nOf course, heads are well-paid professionals with prized job security, and 12 million parents have now taken on the burden of home-schooling alongside trying to keep or find a job. Amid these difficulties, the wellbeing of school leaders is no one\u2019s main concern. But survey data shows a third of heads are working longer hours than before (they already did 60-hour weeks), most are still regularly attending school, and alcohol use is creeping up as a coping mechanism. Let us also remember the average age of a headteacher is 50, meaning many are at higher risk if infected with Covid-19.\nTalking to school leaders, many are at the edge of their nerves. Some will leave, more will stay \u2013 and those who do will likely find a new zeal for fighting back.\nTo get ahead, the government should make two moves. First, it must accept that schools cannot return to a situation where slashed budgets mean leaders scrimp on soap and mental health services are impenetrable. Austerity has had its day.\nSecond, ministers must resist pressures to whimsically bounce schools back into service. Anyone who thinks proper social distancing can be done in a full (or even half full) school has either never met a child, or been in a school. A properly planned and clearly communicated return is the least everyone is owed.\nFinally, I would implore everyone, parents, governors, the entire public, to go easy on schools. They cannot be perfect at this time. Children will be upset about cancelled exams. Not every school can stay open for Easter. One may have sent home a whizzy digital learning package, another may have sent textbooks and a wish of good luck. When the world changes in nine minutes, it rarely changes equally. No one is having an easy pandemic. Let\u2019s hope it is over soon.",

They were working with a small Essex-based specialist, Darwood IP, whose founder, the junior doctor Alastair Darwood, designs medical devices.\nThe devices had not been formally ordered or paid for because they were yet to receive regulatory approval.\nWhile the BlueSky machine was capable of ventilating patients, clinicians on the government\u2019s technical design authority and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found it was not suited for treating Covid-19.\nThis is because fluid builds up in the lungs of coronavirus patients faster than in people suffering from other ailments. The devices must be switched to a different setting while the patient\u2019s lungs are being cleared and the BlueSky machine did not lend itself to frequent changes.\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said the decision had been taken \u201cfollowing a reassessment of the product\u2019s viability in light of the ever-developing picture around what is needed to most effectively treat Covid-19\u201d.\nFormula One teams are assisting with several ventilator projects under the umbrella title Project Pitlane. A spokesperson for Formula One said: \u201cThe F1 team project leads for BlueSky \u2013 Aston Martin Red Bull Racing and Renault DP World F1 Team \u2013 have shown brilliant dedication and skill throughout the project and should feel proud of the work they have undertaken to develop a new device with an NHS entrepreneur and will continue to provide vital contributions to Project Pitlane.\u201d\nOne source familiar with multiple ventilator projects said the issues that affected BlueSky showed why regulators could not rush through new devices.\n\u201cPeople are still testing these things in clinical trials and our understanding is evolving every day, so that might be part of why it\u2019s taking a bit longer,\u201d they said.\nThe MHRA approval process can take years but officials are working round the clock to move faster.\nOne device, made by Oxfordshire-based Penlon with backing from manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, is expected to win approval soon because it varies only slightly from proven machines.\nThe Ventilator Challenge UK consortium has offered to build 5,000 of these and some have already been delivered to hospitals where doctors are performing clinical trials.\nThe same consortium has also delivered the first of up to 10,000 ParaPAC ventilators made by Luton-based Smiths Medical, which are already approved for use.\nBut tens of thousands of the machines that have won provisional orders from the government are yet to be rubber-stamped.\nThey include 10,000 of the Zephyr Plus model made by the defence firm Babcock and German medical device specialist Dr\u00e4gerwerk. The Zephyr Plus has the advantage of being based on existing designs.\nDyson\u2019s brand new CoVent prototype is not thought to have undergone rigorous testing yet, while another device made by a Cambridge-based company called Science Group is also untried.",

Administrators are also able to disclaim uneconomic contracts, freeing the company from onerous obligations.\nTo succeed, a deed of company arrangement requires support from half the creditors, by number and amount owed.\nDeloitte and Virgin Australia declined to comment. McKnight could not be reached.\nVirgin Australia has asked for a $1.4bn loan from the government as part of a proposed broader $5bn airline industry bailout, but so far the deputy prime minister and transport minister, Michael McCormack, has resisted calls to prop up the sector through a direct cash injection.\nOn Tuesday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said both Virgin Australia and Qantas had \u201csubstantial shareholders\u201d \u2013 a reference, in Virgin Australia\u2019s case, to Singapore Airlines, the Chinese state-owned group HNA and Etihad, which is owned by Abu Dhabi.\nHe said the government was \u201cabsolutely committed to the aviation sector\u201d, pointing to a $1bn support package it has already announced.\nHowever, airline sources say the package does little to help because $700m of it is made up of waivers of fees that are not charged when planes are grounded.\nAirline industry sources said the sector is hopeful the government will fund key domestic routes, which have become unprofitable because planes are about 30% full.\nIt is understood the government is looking at providing additional support worth tens of millions of dollars for Virgin and Qantas, in order to ensure secure and affordable access for passengers and freight on essential domestic air routes.\nThere has also been speculation in government circles that a foreign airline might swoop on Virgin Australia.\nOn Tuesday, Albanese dismissed this idea as unrealistic and said that if Australia was going to lose the two-airline model, the government should intervene.\n\u201cThe idea that Virgin can disappear and someone will just come in and pick up what\u2019s left is just a triumph of hope over reality, which is why people in the government are talking about opening up Australian domestic routes to foreign carriers, which would carry foreign crew and pay foreign wages.\u201d\nAsked whether any mooted assistance should be available to other airlines, Albanese said it was Virgin that needed support now, but the point was to bolster the industry as a whole.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about favouring one airline or another. This is about favouring an industry structure that serves the national interest.\u201d\nBut Albanese said taxpayer money should not be given unconditionally. He said Labor was flexible about the structure of the support, but there was no reason the government could not make a financial injection through equity with the ability to sell that stake down the track.\n\u201cThis is an ideal time \u2013 if anything this is the bottom of the market, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Albanese said.\nThe head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, has also insisted Australia needs new two airlines, and has launched an investigation into attacks on Virgin Australia by Qantas and its chief executive, Alan Joyce.\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic financial markets have become increasingly nervous about Virgin Australia\u2019s financial stability.\nThe company has been in the red every year for the past five years, running up losses of more than $1.6bn. It lost an additional $88m in the six months to the end of the year.\nOf the $4.8m the airline owes to its banks, $540m needs to be repaid or refinanced before the end of this calendar year.\nAt the start of the year Virgin Australia had $900m in free cash, but has continued to burn money despite grounding its fleet.\nIts ability to raise more money by borrowing against its planes, as Qantas has done, is restricted.\nAs of the middle of last year, it had already borrowed $2.3bn against $3bn in planes, and industry sources say the value of the craft will have declined due to the pandemic, making further lending less likely.\nIncluded in the mountain of debt is $700m owed to investors in junk bonds that pay a high interest rate of 8%, issued to fund the takeover of the company\u2019s frequent flyer program, Velocity.\nThe bonds, issued in November at a face value of $100, last changed hands on Friday for just $39, indicating that traders believe the risk of default is very high.",

        "content": "Figures for facilities operated by HC-One and MHA sign of rising scale of fatalities\nTwo of the largest providers of care homes in the UK have revealed the deaths of 521 residents from coronavirus in recent weeks, in the clearest sign yet of the rising scale of fatalities outside the NHS which have not been officially announced.\nHC-One, which operates about 350 homes, said that as of 8pm on Monday there had been 311 deaths from confirmed or suspected Covid-19, with outbreaks in two thirds of its homes. MHA, a charitable operator, said there have been 210 deaths across 131 homes, with outbreaks in about half of its homes.\nThe figures contrast both with Monday\u2019s assertion by Chris Whitty, the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser, that there are outbreaks in one in seven care homes in England and data published weekly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which has a 10-day time lag.\nThe latest weekly care home death toll published by the ONS on Tuesday showed that only 237 people died in care homes in England and Wales in the two weeks to 3 April, with all but 20 cases in the last seven days of that period.\nHC-One and MHA together operate 3% of England\u2019s care homes but their combined death toll is already higher than the ONS figures, which either suggests undercounting due to the ONS\u2019s method of relying on what is recorded on death certificates, or there has been a recent sharp rise in care deaths. \nMHA\u2019s figures up to Monday also suggest a considerable increase of 89 fatalities in the last six days. Last Tuesday, it told the Guardian, there had been 121 deaths.\nA study published at the weekend by academics at the London School of Economics of early figures from Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium appear to show that care home deaths may account for about half of the total death toll.\nThe National Care Association has warned that deaths in care homes risk being \u201cairbrushed out\u201d with the headline daily death toll announced by the government only relating to deaths in the NHS. The ONS is gathering care home figures from death certificates where doctors report that a fatality was confirmed or suspected of having occurred because of the virus.\nSir David Behan, executive chairman of HC-One, said: \u201cCovid-19 deaths are representative of about a third of all deaths we have had over the last three weeks. We have staff feeling anxious not just about PPE [personal protective equipment], but that they will catch the virus and bring it home to their loved ones.\u201d\nHe said staff also felt helpless about seeing people they had cared for, in many cases for several years, perish from the disease.\nScotland has officially confirmed that Covid-19 is present in about a third of its care homes. On Monday the Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, said it had been identified in 406 facilities. As in England there have been clusters of deaths in Scotland including 13 in one Glasgow care home. Whitty said on Monday that in the preceding 24 hours there had been 92 new outbreaks in care settings in England.\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, defended the government\u2019s approach to publishing data only after it has been extracted by the ONS from death certificates saying that it was \u201ctrustworthy\u201d.\n\u201cThat is a fair system of getting that unfortunate picture across the country where there are deaths from coronavirus,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe are absolutely being transparent, but what the gov wants to provide at its daily briefing is quick information, accurate information.\u201d\nRos Altmann, the former government minister, has said care home residents \u201care being abandoned like lambs to the slaughter\u201d.\nShe told Today: \u201cIt\u2019s what one or two people from care homes have said to me. They are left without protective equipment, they can\u2019t find it, or testing even if they request it, it\u2019s not always given to them. They haven\u2019t got the staff they need \u2026 and they feel that the NHS has kind of left them in the lurch. GPs are not coming into the care homes in the way that they used to and some are finding if people need to be hospitalised either that tends to be very difficult or if people are sent to hospital they are sent back very quickly and there are no tests so they don\u2019t know if these people are infecting others in their care homes.\u201d\nShe added that \u201cbecause no family are allowed to visit, there is very little scrutiny\u201d.",

Staff are being retrained and non-essential operations across the country have been cancelled.\nBut the health system still needs more medical personnel to care for patients, increase the levels of testing, and track down people who have been in contact with those who are sick. The Robert Koch Institute, which advises the government on public health, has said 2,300 doctors are believed to be off sick or in quarantine. But with no central collation of data, the real figure is believed to be much higher. In the state of Bavaria alone, 244 doctors\u2019 practices have had to close because of coronavirus infections.\nMatch4Healthcare, a website backed by medical authorities which was created by a volunteer team of students and hackers, seeks to match healthcare workers and volunteers \u2013 both citizens and foreigners living in Germany \u2013 to clinics and care homes needing support.\nThe eastern state of Saxony is at the forefront of a campaign calling on foreign doctors, including the thousands of refugees who arrived in 2015, to help. According to the Facebook group Syrian Doctors in Germany there are 14,000 Syrian doctors waiting for their qualifications to be approved.\n\u201cWe are keen for anyone to get in touch who is in a position to help,\u201d said a spokesman for the medical association in Leipzig, Saxony. \u201cIt could be someone who does not yet have their medical licence, but is on their way to getting it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date around 400 have been in touch.\u201d\nSaxony, with a population of just over 4 million, has not been as badly hit by the virus as other regions, but concern is growing. By Friday, there were almost 4,000 confirmed cases and 76 of them had died. \u201cRight now the situation is still under control, but as it gets worse we need to prepare for that,\u201d the spokesman said.\nIn its Facebook appeal the medical association calls on German-speaking \u201cforeign doctors already living in Saxony but who have not yet got their medical licence to help with coronavirus support\u201d.\nWhat makes Saxony\u2019s plea salient is that it is the home of Pegida, the anti-Islam protest movement, and the heartland of the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party. The AfD rose to prominence \u2013 becoming the largest opposition in parliament in 2017 \u2013 on the back of voter anger over Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to allow almost 1 million refugees into the country in 2015.\nThe chancellor\u2019s resistance to closing Germany\u2019s borders prompted a huge backlash against her Christian Democrats\u2019 refugee policy, with many accusing Merkel of undermining national security. Now, although the government was initially reluctant to do so, closing the national border to most neighbouring countries is regarded as a matter of national safety, to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\nOpponents of the government\u2019s open door policy argued refugees would be a drain on the economy and compromise national security. Those in favour said that, as the majority were young, they would help plug a growing skills shortage caused by an ageing population.\nSafwan Adnan Ali arrived from Syria in July 2016. He studied general surgery in Latakia for four years, then moved to Iraq to avoid military service, where he worked as a general practitioner for a year.\nSince arriving in Germany as a refugee, he has been learning the language and preparing for exams which will allow his qualifications to be recognised.\n\u201cI was waiting for the exam for medical language use, but then the coronavirus came and everything has ground to a halt,\u201d the 37-year-old said. \u201cWhen the appeal was announced \u2026 I thought I\u2019d really like to help. I need to do something useful, and I\u2019d like to give something back to the country which has helped me so much, so I sent off my CV immediately.\u201d\nHe has also applied to help Bavaria, one of the worst-hit regions, which recently announced that doctors without medical licences would be given immediate permission to work there for a year. In recent days other states have announced easier access to exam procedures and a relaxation on qualification rules.\nAdnan Ali said: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to go anywhere I\u2019m needed. Although as I have my wife and one-year-old daughter in Saxony, I\u2019d prefer to work here close to them if I can.\u201d\nHis WhatsApp group of Syrian doctors living in Germany has been debating whether access to the medical system due to the pandemic will shorten their wait to enter the profession.\n\u201cI really hope this will make it easier by maybe cutting down some of the unwieldy bureaucratic procedures,\u201d he said.\nAhmad Dahhan, 35, said when he arrived in Germany from Syria in December 2015 he hoped to be able to resume his medical career as soon as possible. \u201cEveryone has their dreams,\u201d he said, \u201cbut bureaucracy has made things very difficult and slow, and it has been an extremely frustrating time.\u201d\nDahhan studied biochemistry at the University of Aleppo before training as a gynaecologist at Damascus University. \u201cThey say they are in need of doctors, even when there isn\u2019t a health crisis, but it\u2019s not at all straightforward to get into the profession.\u201d\nHe has studied German, spent two months working alongside doctors at a gynaecology department in Leipzig, and attended courses of advanced training for foreign doctors, but since the coronavirus struck, he has been confined to his apartment.\n\u201cIt is extremely discouraging to know that I could be doing something far more useful,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I welcome the opportunity to be able to do so and hope that will help Germany recognise we can also be helpful even when there is not a crisis on.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s health ministry said it was in the process of \u201cinvestigating all possible legal options\u201d to speed up the applications of qualified doctors, especially those who only required a medical language exam.",

        "content": "Scientists say the rapid change could have negative effects on fisheries and aquaculture, and impact coastal vegetation\nWater in estuaries along 1,100km of Australia\u2019s south-east coast warmed by more than 2C between 2007 and 2019, a new study finds.\nThe rapid change could have negative effects on fisheries and aquaculture, as well as impact coastal vegetation such as mangroves, scientists behind the study said.\nScientists analysed 6,200 measurements from 166 estuaries along 1,100km of the New South Wales coastline. All the estuaries were acidifying.\nThe study used data collected by field staff from the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment and covered five different types of estuaries \u2013 rivers, creeks, lakes and two kinds of lagoons.\nLagoons warmed 3.65C over the 12 years and rivers warmed 2.79C, the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found.\nThe warming in estuaries was occurring at a much faster rate than the average warming in the atmosphere or in the oceans \u2013 demonstrating that impacts of warming were not uniform and some habitats could see more rapid change.\nThe study said: \u201cOur results highlight that air or ocean temperatures alone cannot be relied upon to estimate climate change in estuaries; rather, individual traits of any estuary need to be considered in the context of regional climate trends.\u201d\nThe study did not try to directly link the warming in estuaries to climate change but the authors noted that temperatures in estuaries had risen against a backdrop of Australia\u2019s changing climate.\nAccording to Bureau of Meteorology data, NSW has not had a year where temperatures were below average since 1997. The two hottest years on record were 2019 followed by 2018.\nDr Elliot Scanes, a marine biologist at the University of Sydney and lead author of the study, told Guardian Australia that he was confident that global heating was partly to blame for the rising temperatures.\nHe said the data showed that \u201cclimate change has arrived in Australia; it is not a projection based on modelling, but empirical data from more than a decade of investigation\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThese sorts of affects have been anticipated, but maybe not at this rate. We have known that climate change will manifest in estuaries in some capacity.\n\u201cThis sort of rapid change could have negative effects for fisheries, but it\u2019s going to be species specific.\u201d\nAs well as rising air temperatures, a reduction in rainfall over the 12 years was also likely to have cut streamflow which meant the estuaries were shallower and more prone to heating.\nProf Pauline Ross, of the University of Sydney\u2019s School of Life and Environmental Sciences and a co-author of the study, said estuaries provided \u201cimmense ecological and economic value\u201d.\n\u201cThe rates of change observed in the study may also jeopardise the viability of coastal vegetation such as mangroves and saltmarsh in the coming decades and reduce their capacity to mitigate storm damage and sea level rise.\u201d\nDr Ben Henley, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cThis is an interesting study and a very useful dataset but I would caution against extrapolating long-term trends or attributing climate change from a 6 to 12 year record. Ongoing monitoring will be important to confirm the trends in these observations.\u201d\nThe study also found that estuaries were acidifying with an average drop in pH of 0.5 between 2013 and 2019.\nThe causes for this drop, said Scanes, were harder to understand but could be down to higher CO2 in the atmosphere and the lower rainfall reducing the exchange of waters between the oceans and estuaries, causing minerals to build up.\nEstuaries in eastern Australia tended to be shallower, but shared characteristics with many other regions of the world that were also experiencing warming and drying climates, the study said.\nProf Perran Cook, of Monash University and an expert in estuaries and changes in coastal environments, said warming temperatures in estuaries would tend to lower oxygen levels in the water, increasing the risk of fish kills.\nBut he cautioned that the study covered a relatively short time period. Australia\u2019s climate was already variable and he questioned whether that 2C warming trend over just 12 years would continue.\n\u201cThat\u2019s saying that estuaries would be 6C warmer (in 20 years\u2019 time) and I find that hard to believe,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "With families and couples filming themselves dancing or performing skits, the app has become even more popular in recent weeks. I asked its British stars to help me get started\nAndy Warhol predicted a time everyone would have 15 minutes of fame. He was nearly right \u2013 it is actually 15 seconds. That is the maximum duration of a video clip with music (non-music clips can last up to a minute) on TikTok, the video-sharing platform that has taken the world by storm. Favoured by under-25s, who make up its core audience, TikTok this year surpassed Facebook and WhatsApp as the world\u2019s most downloaded non-gaming app.\nTikTok\u2019s content doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, and ranges from food to fashion, pranks to pets \u2013 as well as the ubiquitous dance challenges. It is a perfect fit, in other words, for the lockdown, when many of us are stuck inside and in desperate need of some silly fun. This may be why, even if you haven\u2019t downloaded it, you suddenly find, clogging up your social media, clips of Justin Bieber dancing to I\u2019m a Savage by Megan Thee Stallion, or Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez swapping outfits to Drake\u2019s Flip the Switch. It seems everyone from doctors and nurses in PPE to bemused parents quarantined with teenagers are flocking to the app \u2013 and sometimes going viral in the process.\nWhat makes it stand apart from Snapchat or the now defunct Vine is one crucial difference: the closely guarded algorithm that produces the app\u2019s opening dashboard. Unlike other apps, this home screen is not full of people you are following. That is because the algorithm searches for new clips rather than pushing already popular ones. Translation: you don\u2019t need lots of followers to go viral. It is this tantalising prize that gives the app its USP, and what keeps TikTokers ticking over.\nBut how easy is it to become a TikTok influencer? I decided to try my hand at becoming TikTok\u2019s next big thing, with the help of some of the app\u2019s current British stars.\nI am not a total TikTok novice, having tuned in almost daily for a year. I like the food and travel videos, as well as young female comedians (in particular Brittany Broski and ChiwithaC). Mostly though, I\u2019m in it for the cat videos. (I\u2019m not the only one: the #catsoftiktok hashtag has 5.9bn views.) In fact, my first foray into creating TikTok content was a (now deleted) video of a kitten grooming. I filmed it on Instagram, added a filter to give it a heavy-metal soundtrack and flames to make it look as though the cat was headbanging. Hilarious, right? It received a handful of views and no likes. Later, while complaining to a friend\u2019s little sister that headbanging cats is objectively great content, I was instructed that the issue was using the wrong hashtags and not using a TikTok filter.\nHer explanation tells you a lot about TikTok culture. The app, which launched in 2016 in China under the name Douyin  with a focus on lip-syncing, was specifically designed with teenagers in mind. The hashtags invite you to take part and set challenges. Any user not sure what to create has not only topics but tools at their disposal, from image filters to options to use other users\u2019 music or visuals.\nI start by figuring out what is popular in the hope that I can ride the wave. As usual there is a dance challenge, currently #blindinglights, which sees people do a set sequence to a song by the same name from the Weeknd. But as dancing is not my strong point, I pass. Luckily, nearly all the other current trends are related to lockdown. As I too am in lockdown, I smell an opportunity.\nI try out the tools by using two clips I already have. First, using my clip of a fox yawning in my back garden, I\u2019ll shoot myself looking bored around the house. Then I\u2019ll add music so it looks as if the yawning fox is singing. For my second video, I\u2019ll try a traditional \u201chands in pans\u201d food instruction clip. I have a video of a big box of Cornish fish I received from relatives, as well as pictures of the process of prepping, portioning up and freezing it. I know haddock storage doesn\u2019t sound the most appealing subject for the under-25s, but I need something.\nThat is when I encounter my first hurdle. The great illusion of TikTok is that the best content is off the cuff. Some is, but for those who do TikTok seriously, it is a craft. I was shocked by how long my first few videos took. I needed to convert all my pictures into short videos, then find a song that delivered the right high note, at just the right moment, so it would look as though my yawning fox was singing \u2013 genuinely one of my most tricky journalistic assignments.\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok.

Based in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, London, Soni performs magic tricks on his TikTok. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes into it. Planning ideas, rehearsing the right tricks for the right moment, then editing the video. Then I have to figure out the best time for me to post. There\u2019s lots of tactics.\u201d\nSoni posts on other platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, but his biggest audience is on TikTok. When he is recognised on the street, \u201cit\u2019s usually TikTok\u201d. His TikTok reputation helps him get corporate bookings, but he is beginning to generate income working with brands such as Burger King to promote their products, as well as record labels who pay him to use certain songs in his clips in the hope others will borrow that music \u2013 and so on \u2013 until it goes viral. Indeed, TikTok\u2019s influence on the music industry is huge. It is seen as an incubator for smash hits and a way to turn lesser-known artists into stars: Lizzo\u2019s Good As Hell and Doja Cat\u2019s Say So became hits after being repeatedly used in clips on the site while Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road was popularised through a viral dance challenge.\nSoni\u2019s passion for magic shines through on his clips. I realise that if I want to be a big TikToker, I need a focus. I choose \u201cLondon lockdown nature moments\u201d as my subject. I figure that seeing flowers, bees and beautiful trees thrive in the green spots near where I live is exactly what people want to see.\nI check on my first two videos. Weirdly, fish storage is outperforming the fox. I pull together another video from clips and pictures of a walk I had taken in a secluded wood as part of my government-approved walk. A friend gives me a tip about some nearby fields and I plan to head there the next day for my daily exercise.. But when I wake up, I feel camera shy. I had not worn makeup in the previous posts and am suddenly self-conscious.\n\u201cI try to go makeup-free, or not look so great some days,\u201d says Abi Else, AKA @aaaaaaaaaabi, a 22-year old TikToker from Brighton who focuses on style. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that younger people know that it\u2019s fine to not look perfect all the time.\u201d Pressure to conform to certain beauty standards is one of a range of pressures women face online; their appearance is often targeted in the abuse they receive. And TikTok has come under fire after reports that moderators were told to suppress videos from ugly, obese, poor and disabled users. TikTok claims the policy was to prevent bullying and has since changed its guidelines.\nElse, however, says her 80,000 followers are \u201creally nice ... When I\u2019ve had videos go viral, that\u2019s when all the hateful comments come in. I think a lot of the time it\u2019s because it\u2019s a young audience. They don\u2019t understand that it is actually someone on the other side.\u201d\nShe tells me that it is important to engage with your audience and let them get to know you. Else likes to ask her audience questions so they feel part of the clips. I shoot a video of me in a tree with a fact about London\u2019s green spaces so that my new followers (all two of them) can get a sense of who I am. The next day I find it is my best performing video so far. Well, after the one about fish.\nIf anyone can tell me about how to build an audience based around personality, it is Perrin Hooper, AKA @persworld, an 18-year-old TikToker with 380,000 followers. Hooper\u2019s style is to talk straight to camera and muse on life \u2013 a video diary with the odd dance thrown in. Hailing from Cornwall, Hooper says: \u201cWhere I live, social media is your main way of reaching out.\u201d\nHooper spends roughly three days a week working on TikTok, and the rest of the week is spent running an Etsy store selling pendants and other crafts. Recently, Hooper \u2013 who uses the pronoun they \u2013 has started producing and selling their own merchandise, a project they are working on with their mother. Mum does the \u201cnitty gritty, stuff like costs, margins, packaging\u201d while Hooper takes care of the creative side of things.\nDespite its focus on young people, TikTok as a family business is not uncommon. One of the most famous TikTok families is the Harfins (@refelicity) \u2013 AKA Felicity and her sons, Finlay and Harrison \u2013 from Edinburgh, Scotland. Their 1.8 million followers watch the family play pranks, dance, cook and generally muck about. Felicity, a former marketer, runs the account and has helped to turn it into a business giving clients \u2013 from Mattel to the Brits \u2013 the chance to be mentioned or promoted in their videos. Indeed, it is now Felicity\u2019s main job. But it was the boys who initiated the project. \u201cThey grew up watching videos online and always wanted to create themselves.\u201d It took them years to persuade her. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much fun it was going to be.\u201d\nFelicity says that TikTok has given them \u201csomething creative to do as a family\u201d. But the Harfins are often recognised in their daily life \u2013 and her sons are growing up internet-famous.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had to learn younger than most about behaviour in public. People film them, so they\u2019ve learned not to do something they\u2019d be worried about being put online.\u201d\nI am curious about Felicity\u2019s opinion on TikTok\u2019s safety protocols, which have been the subject of sustained criticism from children\u2019s charities. The concerns centre around how quickly inappropriate content spreads, owing to the very algorithm that defines the app. One such example is the #kidnap hashtag, which saw boys pretend to kidnap girls or girls pretend to be kidnapped. It\u2019s acting, but such graphic themes are usually the preserve of 18-rated movies, not a fleeting challenge of schoolchildren.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that criticism is limited to TikTok,\u201d she says, noting that YouTube is \u201cfar worse\u201d and that TikTok has \u201csorted out\u201d a lot of its problems. TikTok recently raised the age for using its live broadcast function from 13 to 18 after it was reported that predators were using the feature to groom children. It has also added functions such as restricted mode and family safety mode, which allow parents and children\u2019s accounts to be linked.\nAfter we speak, Hooper sends me some suggestions to improve my ratings \u2013 they advise I try a voiceover so people can hear me and to shoot vertically rather than in landscape. I have a brainwave. What better way to show TikTok more of myself, focus on nature and join in with the stay-home trends than with a guided tour around my garden \u2013 from the cherry tree to the chewed-up slippers the foxes leave each night. Given the time, skill and expertise of the people I have interviewed, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to cut it as a TikTok superstar any time soon. But I don\u2019t mind, as long as I can some day beat the 375 views of my frozen fish.",

        "content": "The pandemic is hitting already struggling communities in places such as Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and the Navajo Nation\nThe coronavirus pandemic is hitting hard in America\u2019s most vulnerable communities already burdened by toxic industries and environmental pollution. Experts warn that this elevates the risk of developing complications from Covid-19.\nPolluted neighbourhoods in cities such as Los Angeles, Houston, Newark, and Detroit, as well as the Navajo Nation are among the country\u2019s worst virus hotspots, a Guardian analysis found. It follows a preliminary US study published last week indicating that even small exposure to pollution in the years before the virus outbreak is associated with a 15% higher risk of death from coronavirus.\nAs the virus sweeps across the US, major risk factors include poverty, pollution, pre-existing medical conditions, substandard housing and inadequate health care, running water and nutrition. These are issues that most commonly afflict poor people of color.\n\u201cEnvironmental justice communities were already the most vulnerable, marginalized, uninsured and sickest, with high rates of asthma, respiratory illness, diabetes and heart disease,\u201d said Robert Bullard, professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University.\nThe Guardian researched deaths per capita, and speed of spread of the virus in a number of US cities and communities and found:\nLos Angeles, California. There have been at least 296 deaths from Covid-19 in Los Angeles county, which includes the city of Los Angeles, and where the death rate was three per 100,000 people on Monday \u2013 50% higher than the statewide average. The county has some of the worst air quality in the US.\nDetroit, Michigan. Wayne county \u2013 which includes Detroit \u2013 has had more than 700 Covid-19 deaths, and its death rate of 40 per 100,000 people, is more than 250% higher than the statewide average. Detroit had the country\u2019s 12th worst soot pollution in 2019, according to the American Lung Association (ALA) and thousands of households lack running water.\nHouston, Texas. Harris county, which includes metropolitan Houston, had 79 confirmed coronavirus cases per 100,000 people by Monday \u2013 61% higher than the state average. Last week, officials confirmed that African Americans accounted for two-thirds of the early Covid-19 deaths in the city \u2013 home to widespread heavy polluting industries \u2013 despite accounting for only 22.5% of the total population.\nThe Navajo Nation. Navajo county has the highest virus rate in Arizona with 317 cases per 100,000, compared with 53 per 100,000 statewide. The Nation has longstanding environmental and health inequalities.\nPre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and heart disease alongside older age, obesity and compromised immune systems from cancer treatment or smoking, increase the risk of developing Covid-19 complications requiring critical care, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nMany such health problems are more common among lower-income neighbourhoods, data on Native Americans and people of color from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows.\nIn addition, polluting heavy industries such as power plants, manufacturing facilities and toxic chemical sites are much more likely to be built near these communities, described as \u201csacrifice zones\u201d by environmental justice advocates.\n\u201cThe sacrifice zones are where the virus definitely is taking hold, because you\u2019ve got all these pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Mustafa Ali, formerly an environmental justice official at the EPA in the Obama era.\nThe pandemic is hitting already struggling communities, just as the Trump administration advances sweeping regulatory rollbacks of protections for the environment and public health. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has told companies they don\u2019t need to monitor and report pollution \u2013 if they can argue they have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.\nAge-adjusted death rates from heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, pneumonia and influenza are all higher in Detroit, where almost 80% of the population is black, than the US average\nAbout 300 out of every 100,000 Detroit residents died from heart disease compared with 165 in the US at large, according to the CDC and Michigan health department.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we begin, and then there has been another really dangerous overlay of diseases as a result of the [mass] water shutoffs,\u201d said Gloria House, an activist with We the People of Detroit. \u201cNow comes Covid-19, so of course our numbers are going to escalate, because our community is so vulnerable already.\u201d\nNearly a quarter of Wayne county, more than double the national rate, lives in poverty, which has been exacerbated by factory shutdowns over several decades.\nEPA rollbacks could have devastating consequences around Houston \u2013 a massive industrial region with more than 500 petrochemical facilities, a busy shipping channel, sprawling highways and commercial railroads. \u201cBy anyone\u2019s standards, Houston has one of the highest densities of polluting industries in the country, if not the world,\u201d said Elena Craft, senior director at the Environmental Defence Fund (EDF), which coordinates a local project tracking air quality.\nLocated on the pollution-heavy east side is Pleasantville, a community of 3,000 people, which is 75% African American and 25% Latino, and is close to the port, a freeway and metal recycling plants. Forty per cent of the population is over 50, and most families do not have private medical insurance. The closest county hospital is 10 miles away, since the local one was permanently closed after flooding during Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sick and vulnerable people in our community and we\u2019re absolutely worried. But the disparities existed before Covid, and will still be there after unless action is taken to improve the quality of life for all citizens,\u201d said Brigitte Murray, a retired nurse and activist.\n\u201cLos Angeles has some of the worst air pollution in the country and there is very good epidemiological evidence that particle and gaseous pollutants exacerbate both asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease],\u201d said Dr John Balmes, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital.\nBoth conditions increase the risk of bad Covid-19 outcomes. Before this pandemic, air pollution was believed to cause around 30,000 deaths annually in the US.\nDespite significant improvements over the last two decades, the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area topped the latest list for the highest number of smog days and ranked among the worst places for soot pollution, according to the ALA\u2019s most recent air quality index, which analyzes annual and short-term spikes in contaminants.\nIn 2017, 38 per 100,000 adults in LA county were admitted to hospital for asthma \u2013 one of the highest rates in the state.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that LA county and environmental justice communities across the country are suffering a disproportionate burden of Covid-19,\u201d added Balmes. \u201cHealth disparities always come down to economic disparities which is shameful in the United States.\u201d\nAlmost 49% of the county identifies as Latino or Hispanic, 15% as Asian and 9% as African American. Just under 84% are US citizens; one in six residents lives in poverty.\nThe Navajo Nation was quick to ramp up prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March. But it\u2019s struggling to contain the spread on its vast territory through Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, with 813 confirmed cases including 28 deaths as of 13 April. \nIn Coconino county, where Navajo people account for about 60% of cases, the death rate is eight times the state average.\nChronic environmental and health inequalities could be significant: the Navajo Nation is an extreme food desert with just 13 stores for 180,000 people on the reservation. In addition, about a third of people lack indoor plumbing and electricity. As a result, many Navajo struggle to access affordable fresh produce and clean drinking water \u2013 essential for a strong immune system.\nOne consequence is higher rates of diabetes, which affects one in five Navajo, compared with one in 11 in the general population. The evidence suggests diabetics face a higher chance of serious complications including death from Covid-19.\nJust west of the US focus of the coronavirus in New York City, 10 New Jersey counties are among the country\u2019s 50 hotspots with the highest rate of cases.\nThis includes Essex county, home to the city of Newark, which is surrounded by heavy polluting industries, including \u201cthe state\u2019s largest incinerator, the country\u2019s longest Superfund site, fat-rendering plants, plastic plants, natural gas plants \u2013 you name it,\u201d said Maria Lopez-Nunez, director of environmental justice and community development at the Ironbound Community Corporation.\nAlmost half of Newark residents are African American, and 36% are Latinos.\nMustafa Ali said the coronavirus crisis represented a crossroads for vulnerable populations. \u201cWe can either continue down the path that we\u2019ve been following, or begin to build a real medical infrastructure in our country \u2026 and tie it to the [pollution hotspots] that have been unseen and unheard.\u201d",

        "content": "Everyone remembers the cricket but few recall the day John Walker took to the track in Melbourne\nIt started with a tweet. On 4 March 2018, reacting to the news that barrier-busting miler Roger Bannister had died, Mike Selvey \u2013 the long-term lord of this manor \u2013 posted the following: \u201cThe great John Walker ran a sub-four-minute mile on a track laid out on the outfield of the MCG during the Centenary Test in March 1977.\u201d\nHold up. He did what? During the most fondly recalled Test ever staged at the G?\nWhen Google turned up nothing, my interest was piqued. I pledged to Selvey \u2013 a member of that England touring squad and a trifle unlucky to miss selection after an impressive showing in the warm-up game \u2013 that I would get to the bottom of it. Well, that was more than two years ago. As is often the case current events overtook but with no such excuse anymore I went digging.\nAs context for those less familiar with the events of that week the occasion would still have been remarkable. Before the Test was played Wisden already declared it would be the \u201cgreatest event in cricket history\u201d. Of the 244 living Ashes players invited to Melbourne, all but 26 made it. Jack Ryder, at 87, was the oldest Australian, dying three weeks later. His opponent from 1920-21, Percy Fender, led 79 Englishmen off their flight, the 84-year-old in a wheelchair.\nThe tale of the match turned out to be just as momentous, the touchstones of it requiring little further explanation: Lillee, Marsh, Willis, Hookes, Greig, McCosker, Randall, the collapses, the chase\u2026 the Queen! Oh, and that the margin was 45 runs in favour of the hosts \u2013 spookily, just as it was in the inaugural fixture they were marking from exactly 100 years before.\nBut let\u2019s zero in on the third day \u2013 the one that opened the door to this Test evolving into a classic after a pair of first-innings collapses. It was on that third afternoon when the 21-year-old debutant David Hookes brashly drove and pulled the England captain Tony Greig\u2019s off-spin to the rope five times in a row. Later, Rick McCosker emerged with a mummified face after Bob Willis broke his jaw the first time around. My dad, in attendance as a 15-year-old, remembers the crowd singing \u201cWaltzing McCosker\u201d as he continued hooking safely through to stumps. As he\u2019s relayed to me many times \u2013 employing an old MCG trope \u2013 55,399 were in the stands for this memorable day in Australian Test history but \u201chalf a million say they were\u201d.\nBefore lunch, Walker \u2013 an Olympic champion nine months earlier \u2013 changed into his famous all-black running kit. At this point Selvey recalls catching his first glimpse of the mighty New Zealander\u2019s distinctive long blond hair and thick thighs. Having won gold in the 1500m at the 1976 Montreal Olympics he was a superstar in the tradition of Trans-Tasman middle-distance giants of the previous quarter-century, from Herb Elliott and Peter Snell to Ron Clarke and John Landy.\nBut when Walker emerged for the start of the Centenary Mile, as it was billed, it would not be alongside the man he expected \u2013 Australia\u2019s best at the distance, Graham Crouch. The \u201clittle Australian\u201d, as he was described on commentary during the frenetic 1974 Commonwealth Games 1500m, was also in the placings when the Kiwi became the first man to break 3:50 for the mile in 1975 and then trailed Walker in his successful Olympic final in 1976. He elected to sit out the race, watching from the stands. Ken Hall, the national champion from only three days earlier, did likewise, citing exhaustion.\nThe field of four Walker had left were, The Age described, \u201cwilling but weak\u201d by comparison. Combined with blustery conditions and a grass track, the organisers\u2019 hopes of a sub-four-minute time were dashed. The champion sat back before going to work in the final 300m, newspaper reports saying he bolted in by 30m in 4:05.\nMemories of Walker\u2019s storming finish, with a final lap of 54sec, tallies with the recollection of Jim Maxwell \u2013 26 at the time \u2013 who then had just called his first of more than 300 Tests the month before. He made the trip partly to work but mostly to socialise, as he did with John Arlott and Alan McGilvray, the man from whom Maxwell would later inherit the tag as the voice of Australian cricket. \u201cWhen you saw him you had to stop,\u201d he recalls of the race. \u201cYou didn\u2019t turn your head. You just watched because he was a very attractive athlete.\u201d\nWalker\u2019s disappointment in his rival Crouch was unmistakable, calling it a \u201cvery bad show\u201d from the local lad. \u201cGraham is supposed to be the best runner in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crowd expected him to run and he should have run.\u201d But Dr Larkins\u2019 perspective is that this was simply reflective of their competitive relationship. For taking part in the race, they all received a brass wine goblet in which Larkins keeps his pens at home to this day.\n\u201cIt always surprises people when I say the biggest crowd that I ran in front of was not at the Olympics but at the MCG during the cricket! And I have very fond memories of John. He was the track star.\u201d\nAfter finding out all there was on the public record and talking to those who remembered it Walker (Sir John, since 2009) kindly agreed to talk to The Spin from his home in Auckland. He might have slowed down over the past two decades owing to Parkinson\u2019s disease but it has not lessened his broader contribution, a decade as a local government councillor only ending last October on retiring at 67.\n\u201cYou are the first person to bring it up with me for over 40 years,\u201d Walker began. He was understandably reluctant to reflect on what happened that day with his old sparring partner Crouch, who died from cancer last year, instead focusing on the honour of performing in front of packed grandstands.\n\u201cI remember going down the back straight being a fair way behind and realising that if I didn\u2019t get into gear I wasn\u2019t going to catch them. So, I took off and won quite easily in the end. Thank you for bringing it up.\u201d\nWalker would not top his 1976 triumph, thwarted by injury and then a boycott, which denied him a chance to defend his Olympic crown in 1980. He never stopped running the mile, becoming the first to break four minutes on 100 occasions in 1985 and going on to do so 135 times.\nAs for Selvey he is pleased his affinity with New Zealand and running did not collude to trick him into believing something that wasn\u2019t. \u201cI thought it might have been something I wanted to have happened,\u201d he says. \u201cThere didn\u2019t seem to be any recollection from anyone.\u201d Well, there is now.\nSigning off from the telecast, Frank Tyson described the Centenary Test as \u201cthe Olympic Games of cricket\u201d. What\u2019s irrefutable is that Olympic spirit did return to a cricket ground that magnificent week, through one of the greatest of them all.\n This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

It said there had been outbreaks in two-thirds of its homes. MHA, a charitable operator, said there had now been 210 deaths across 131 homes and there were outbreaks in around half of its homes.\nThe care home figures contrast with the assertion by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser, that there are outbreaks in one in seven care homes in England. And the ONS figures showed that 237 people died in care homes in the two weeks to 3 April, all but 20 of them in the latest week. Nine of the 217 care home deaths recorded in the week ending 3 April were in Wales.\n\u201cThe latest comparable data for deaths involving Covid-19 with a date of death up to 3 April, show there were 6,235 deaths in England and Wales. When looking at data for England, this is 15% higher than the NHS numbers as they include all mentions of Covid-19 on the death certificate, including suspected Covid-19, as well as deaths in the community.\u201d",

        "content": "Bill Beaumont has pledged to organise a major review of the way World Rugby is run if he is re-elected as chairman next month. The former England captain faces a challenge for the role from his vice-chairman, Agust\u00edn Pichot, who is campaigning on a reform ticket.\nBeaumont published his manifesto on Tuesday \u2013 supported by the French Rugby Federation chairman, Bernard Laporte, who is running for vice-chairman. It proposes a major administrative shake-up with greater emphasis on emerging nations.\n\u201cOur aim is to have a more representative and diverse international federation that better serves the game, not one that is seen to only support the \u2018old guard\u2019,\u201d said Beaumont, who is being painted as a diehard traditionalist in comparison to Pichot.\n\u201cTo achieve our aim of a strong international federation with a clear vision, we are proposing a wide-ranging governance review led by two independently appointed people. All major rugby stakeholders will be consulted, as will experts from outside the game, to help bring in fresh ideas and perspective.\n\u201cWe believe that rugby is at a crossroads. If we work together there is an opportunity to make it a truly global sport played by more at the highest level and enjoyed by more at every level.\u201d\nBeaumont is driving World Rugby\u2019s review of the state of the game with sport suspended throughout the world because of coronavirus. Contingency plans are expected to be announced this week with not only the July tours to the southern hemisphere highly unlikely to go ahead but the November window in Europe under threat as governments consider continuing the restrictions on international travel into the autumn.\n\u201cCoronavirus is having a big impact on rugby globally,\u201d said Beaumont. \u201cIn tough times like these we need our sport to come together. It is only by working together that we can succeed. It is often true that the biggest challenges create the biggest opportunities and it is no different for rugby. We must help each other through these tough times.\n\u201cWe need World Rugby, as our international federation, to be fit for purpose and seen as world leading. We need to define our purpose and mission and what kind of organisation we want in order to lead us into the future. Only then can we decide what the strategic objectives are.\n\u201cFor rugby to thrive we need it to grow into a global sport and move beyond its traditional territories. We need a coherent and meaningful global calendar that supports those at the top of the game and develops those aspiring to be there. We also need to make our sport more attractive to everyone who plays and watches as well as the broadcasters.\u201d\nBeaumont, who is campaigning for women to be represented at every level of decision-making in the game, was behind World Rugby\u2019s plan for a nations championship that foundered last year because it failed to attract the support of all of the Six Nations. Scotland and Ireland were concerned at the potential impact of relegation as the tournament, along with the Rugby Championship, would have divisions of emerging nations beneath it.\nThose divisions are being set up. The plan was to start them next year, but the launch may be pushed back to 2022 because of the present uncertainty. Pichot has made it a central part of his campaign and Beaumont believes it would offer unions, some of which are fearing losses of up to \u00a350m this year, greater financial security.\n\u201cWorld Rugby needs to review its financial policies and not rely on those who have traditionally underpinned the game,\u201d said Beaumont. \u201cA review of how World Rugby funds the game needs to be transparent and, most importantly, we have to look after the health and welfare of our players. Without them, there is no game.\u201d\nBeaumont wants to develop a season that eliminates the overlap between club and country. \u201cWe will bring the tier one and two unions together to devise a plan for a global competition structure that better supports unions at the top and those aspiring to get there. We will consider plans that support international competition between countries and, in consultation with stakeholders, consider concepts that could support an international club competition after the 2023 World Cup.\u201d\nHe said World Rugby was setting up a coronavirus recovery working group made up of key leaders from across the game. Its remit will be to make recommendations to the executive on how the governing body can help unions to recover from the financial impact of Covid-19.",

        "content": "The entertainment media cooperative considers itself a \u2018post-capitalist\u2019 streaming service \u2013 and a critical counterweight to rightwing media\nNaomi Burton and Nick Hayes met at a meeting for the Detroit chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Both were working for automakers in the city: Hayes created freelance video content for them while Burton ran social media for the same companies. Together, they launched Means of Production, a media company that would take no corporate clients.\nFive months later, they made Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s viral Courage To Change video. The social capital they accrued, plus a bit of savings, led them to launch Means TV \u2013 a worker-owned, leftist entertainment media cooperative, supported entirely by subscriber money. As of 7 April, they have 3,700 subscribers, most of whom pay the full fee of $10 a month, though Burton notes that they \u201calways offer discounted subscriptions to anyone who can\u2019t afford it\u201d.\nBurton and Hayes describe Means TV as a \u201cpost-capitalist\u201d streaming service. \u201cWe can start projecting a vision beyond capitalism, and couch our entertainment within this idea of imagining a reality similar to our own, but without the corrosive and toxic effects of capitalism,\u201d says Hayes.\nThe interface for Means TV reminds one of a pared-back Netflix, with content divided by format: full-length films, series, comedy, animation, even kids\u2019 content. Wrinkles and Sprinkles, for example, is a kids\u2019 show which finds two cats \u2013 one a crusty, wisened elder and one a peppy kitten \u2013 learning about direct action and solidarity. Feature-length documentaries detail the Palestinian resistance movement, invasive swamp rats threatening the Louisiana coast\u2019s communities and culture, and indigenous children in Guatemala dodging police in the city while finding ways to provide for their families.\nMeans follows a simple metric for determining suitability of content: \u201cIs this punching up or down? Is this going after people that have more power than us, or is this denigrating people that have less power than us?\u201d\nDavid Jackson, an instructor in Carleton University\u2019s communications department and organizer with the collective Improvising Musicians of Ottawa, says Means provides a critical counterweight to rightwing media. \u201cThere has to be a counter to Breitbart and the \u2018alt-right\u2019 [media] who seem to have a command both on social media and through the press,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cThe political stakes are becoming really, really clear that it is, as it always has been, a matter of life and death.\u201d\nWhile we\u2019re usually able to discern between ideological biases in news media, entertainment media is less overtly politicized. But Hayes and Burton say there are subtle ideological markers which make entertainment an effective \u201ccultural reproduction tool\u201d.\nThey cite the example of the sitcom Friends, which depicted a group of working-class New Yorkers who somehow occupied an enormous apartment. From a young age, Burton couldn\u2019t understand why she \u2013 also from a working-class background \u2013 didn\u2019t have access to the sort of leisure time and aesthetic pleasures that the characters in the show did. \u201cEven Full House, it\u2019s like, \u2018Damn, look at their house, these people seem to be regular working people, but their cars aren\u2019t weird minivans like mine,\u2019\u201d says Burton. \u201cIt totally distorts your idea of the kind of life you\u2019re supposed to live, the way you\u2019re supposed to look, the way you\u2019re supposed to act. We don\u2019t realize we\u2019re being given a political framework from which to look at the world.\u201d\nLos Angeles-based director, comedian and writer Sara June, who works full-time with Means TV, notes that the accessibility of digital media and affordable production options have enabled working-class entertainment media creators to find success. \u201cIt\u2019s never been possible before to do something like this with such a small amount of money,\u201d says June. \u201cPeople without a lot of money didn\u2019t get to make media, and that used to be tied to the mechanics of making media. A worker-owned media has never been possible with video before.\u201d\nThe co-op is divided into three tiers, which determine the percentage of end-of-year profits each worker member gets. Full-time worker members get 70%, contractor members get 20% and royalty members get 10%.\nWashington DC-based journalists and podcast creators Sam Sacks and Sam Knight host Means Morning News, a weekly news show that airs on Means TV. Sacks says that years of neoliberal policy and broadening class gaps have made leftist ideology more palatable. \u201cThe conditions in this country have deteriorated so much, going back decades. People are desperate to figure out why things are breaking down and how we can build a new world.\u201d Knight says young people are interested in leftwing ideas \u201cin ways that the United States hasn\u2019t seen in decades\u201d. Means arrives amid brutal layoffs across US newsrooms, which have increasingly unionized in the past five years. Calls abound for more worker-owned media, and the In These Times labor reporter Hamilton Nolan, who has written for the Guardian, observes that the trend is the product of firsthand experience in poor working conditions. \u201cYou had all these workers going through the experience themselves and getting class consciousness in a sense,\u201d says Nolan.\nFor inspiration, American media workers can turn to successful co-op efforts abroad. When the Argentinian newspaper owner Sergio Szpolski decided to shutter Tiempo Argentino in late 2015, the workers pooled their money to keep it alive as a co-op. Javier Borelli, general information editor with Tiempo Argentino and elected member of the co-op\u2019s executive board, was there during the transition \u2013 a period that saw the paper\u2019s offices attacked by a group of 20 men.\n\u201cWe were very committed to the idea of doing something that could be ours, and we had the energy and time to spend in this situation,\u201d says Borelli. He acknowledges starting the co-op was a risk made possible by situational factors, like most of the workers being young and without families to provide for.\nTiempo Argentino, which is 70% reader-funded, is one of thousands of worker-recovered enterprises across Argentina. \u201cWe followed the examples of the recovered enterprises that started in Argentina in the 1990s,\u201d says Borelli. When neoliberal measures forced private domestic businesses to close in the face of rising imports, workers reopened them as co-ops.\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s the right way,\u201d says Borelli. He studied worker-owned, explicitly leftist media models in France and Spain, including France\u2019s Mediapart which is governed by a non-profit trust that guarantees editorial independence. Borelli found that 95% of its revenue came from readers. The paper\u2019s slogan is appropriate: \u201cOnly our readers can buy us.\u201d\nHayes says they would like to develop similar models in radio and video games to give those industries alternatives to relying on advertising, \u201cor some billionaire\u201d. Right now, these concepts seem like tall asks. But June points out: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to do anything incredibly radical. We\u2019re trying to create media in a space where there\u2019s a democratic workplace and everybody gets paid for what they do. You\u2019d be surprised at how revolutionary that is.\u201d",

        "content": "William Haggas says horses from around Britain must be allowed to run at Newmarket if racing returns at the track\nHorses from around Britain must be allowed to compete at Newmarket when racing returns there, the trainer William Haggas has said.\nHaggas, delighted to have won two Group Ones in Australia in the past month, has been turning his mind to how racing in this country may resume behind closed doors and is firmly against suggestions that trainers may be restricted to running at their local racing \u201chub\u201d.\n\u201cI think Newmarket is an obvious place to resume racing,\u201d Haggas said, \u201cand I think most people agree, because we have a lot of horses here, we have two racecourses; the Rowley Mile in particular is well known as about the bleakest racecourse in the country and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to social distance there. I think it\u2019s very workable and I\u2019m sure it will happen.\n\u201cBut what I am vehemently opposed to is racing for Newmarket horses only. I think that\u2019s nonsense. If you\u2019re going to race in Newmarket, do it for everyone. We\u2019re not going to start until the lockdown relaxes and if the lockdown relaxes, there is no problem transporting horses round the country. It would be a nonsense to have Newmarket races only for Newmarket trainers. We\u2019re not that desperate. We can\u2019t encourage that, that is not the right way forward.\u201d\nThe government is expected to announce an extension to the lockdown this week, with periods of three or six weeks being mooted. Once it is over Haggas said Britain should be looking to copy Australia, Hong Kong and Japan, where racing has continued without spectators and is subject to strict physical distancing measures. The Newmarket man was among those to benefit on Saturday when Addeybb won the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at a racecourse in Sydney.\nHaggas said: \u201cThey have proved it can keep going in a guarded fashion, safely. We only have to copy those models, surely. Provided we can do it with no detrimental side effects to the National Health Service, the emergency services and ultimately government, then let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d\nWhenever Flat racing does resume, Haggas predicts one of the biggest difficulties for officials will be deciding which horses are allowed to run, with each race certain to be oversubscribed.\n\u201cThe first three weeks are going to be chaos. There\u2019ll be six or seven races a day, maximum fields of maybe 12 because I can\u2019t see them having big fields, and probably 800 entries in every meeting because everyone\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\nIn the meantime his team at Somerville Lodge are doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to protect the health of staff. \u201cThe horses go out in pairs rather than a large string. It just takes a bit more organising but it\u2019s very doable. We try to keep people apart as best they can. It\u2019s not straightforward but they can\u2019t do this work from home, so they\u2019re here and we do it as quickly and responsibly as possible.\u201d",

        "content": "The Mash Report has always turned tough topics into comedy. As it returns in lockdown, host Nish Kumar and standups Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Tom Mayhew talk about satire\u2019s role in a crisis\nWhen Nish Kumar\u2019s political comedy show The Mash Report returned to our TV screens earlier this month, things looked very different to the last series \u2013 and not just because he\u2019d accidentally shaved his beard off. With the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown in place, Kumar hosted the show from his spare room, forcing him to grapple with a professional camera and lighting on his own.\nWriting the show had been challenging, too. He knew that viewers who were isolated from loved ones needed a laugh. But making jokes while respecting the gravity of the situation is a tricky balancing act. In the end, Kumar decided to not to hold back: \u201cThis whole situation is a weird combination of boring and terrifying, like an epidemiology lecture delivered by Freddy Krueger \u2013 or Dominic Raab being, well, Dominic Raab,\u201d he announced. Meanwhile, co-star Rachel Parris tackled self-appointed coronavirus experts, including \u201ctesticle with teeth\u201d, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin.\nThe Mash Report \u2013 and Kumar and Parris\u2019s segments in particular \u2013 has never shied away from tough topics. In past series, Kumar has taken on the rise of the far right, Conservative immigration policies and climate change, somehow making them all funny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not providing people with a full escape,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last few years have been very frenetic. We\u2019ve tried to take those news stories and make them into something that is entertaining, funny and gives people some catharsis, but also doesn\u2019t denigrate the seriousness of the issues.\u201d\nKumar has been creating political comedy for around a decade. During that time, multiple Conservative governments, Brexit and Trump have provided fuel for his best material, causing his profile to rise as he became host of the BBC\u2019s topical radio comedy Newsjack, before taking the lead on The Mash Report.\nHis personal politics are on the left: \u201cI\u2019d hoped, after the financial crisis in 2008, that we would look at the systemic failures that had allowed the crash to happen and rebalance our economy. I\u2019m sad that anger has been directed towards groups of people who are entirely blameless \u2013 people on benefits, people from minority groups. These are not the enemies.\u201d\nThat sense of injustice fuels Kumar\u2019s best work, when, as he puts it, \u201cyou believe in the idea that you\u2019re writing the joke about.\u201d\nIt\u2019s clearly easier, then, to write impassioned comedy when objectionable politicians and policies provide your punchlines: Nigel Farage\u2019s xenophobia, Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment, Donald Trump\u2019s everything. If things were different \u2013 a socialist government, fully funded public services, impeccable leaders \u2013 would the material dry up?\n\u201cI would much rather work a bit harder,\u201d Kumar laughs. \u201cI would rather be writing jokes in a less volatile political climate, still committed to ideals, but without the world burning. Doing comedy can make you a bit hardened, but I\u2019m not a full psychopath yet that I would be like: \u2018Yes! Everyone\u2019s afraid to go outside. Great for me and my content!\u2019\u201d\nKiri Pritchard-McLean, current host of Newsjack and regular on Frankie Boyle\u2019s New World Order and Have I Got News For You, agrees. \u201cIn the last election, I wouldn\u2019t have chosen the Tory government, but that is probably easier to satirise than a hung parliament or a Labour government,\u201d she says. \u201cI would always much rather we had a political system that reflected what I think is fairest, and it was my difficult job to satirise that, than having people I don\u2019t agree with in power, and it being much easier to take potshots at them.\u201d\nEach episode of Newsjack begins with a monologue where Pritchard-McLean jokes about events from the previous week: \u201cIf I don\u2019t care about the subject, I find it quite hard to write a monologue about it.\u201d She\u2019s tackled the racism suffered by Meghan Markle, online abuse and the death of Caroline Flack, and Harvey Weinstein\u2019s crimes.\nShe describes herself as leftwing and anti-inequality \u2013 \u201cwe don\u2019t need as many billionaires and there are a lot of people living in shit places that could do with some money\u201d. That comes through strongly in her standup. It\u2019s there in Newsjack, too, but across the show, which has other writers and receives submissions from the public, there\u2019s a drive to satirise each end of the political spectrum. \u201cIt\u2019s not a party political broadcast for anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big journey for me \u2013 you can\u2019t just say: \u2018These are the bad guys\u2019. We\u2019ve got do better than that. A level of analysis goes into stuff that you might not appreciate when you hear that sketch about a dolphin or whatever. It\u2019s a really hard balance to strike, but it\u2019s also part of making a good show.\u201d\nOver on The Mash Report, Kumar has freedom to broadcast his opinions. \u201cWe wanted to do something that had a point of view. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re there to campaign for one party, but you\u2019re definitely there to represent a set of principles you believe in.\u201d\nNevertheless, he wouldn\u2019t shy away from making others on the left the subject of his jokes. \u201cThere always needs to be accountability, regardless of who\u2019s in government,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cI would almost think you\u2019d want to do that more to people you agree with, because you want to push them to achieve the ideals you share.\u201d\nLike Kumar and Pritchard-McLean, standup comedian Tom Mayhew hasn\u2019t yet had the chance to make comedy under a government he agrees with, but his work has been fuelled by this opposition. His 2019 Edinburgh show I, Tom Mayhew was a takedown of austerity, based on his own experience of the benefits system and the way claimants are treated. His next show looks at so-called low-skilled jobs \u2013 how they\u2019re integral to our society (as proven by the current crisis) and bring joy and worth to many workers, despite the fact they\u2019re not well-paid.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re passionate about something, it makes it easier to write comedy about it,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it\u2019s tough, you\u2019ll find a way to write something funny because you want to express these thoughts and feelings.\u201d\nIf we did end up in a socialist utopia, Mayhew admits that his onstage persona would become cheerier. \u201cBut even if the political landscape changed there will always be people to be held accountable, and there\u2019ll always be perceptions that will need challenging.\u201d\nLike Kumar\u2019s material about climate change or Pritchard-McLean on misogyny, Mayhew\u2019s comedy doesn\u2019t shy away from heavy topics. Yet he\u2019s conscious that audiences don\u2019t want to be preached to. \u201cI want my comedy to be funny first, but meaningful a close second,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t change people\u2019s minds, they\u2019ll hopefully be a bit more understanding of a viewpoint that isn\u2019t theirs. There are some times you go to shows and it does feel a bit like a lecture. That\u2019s not what comedy should be.\u201d\nPritchard-McLean agrees: \u201cI hate seeing satire monologues where they\u2019re tapping in open goals, like \u2018The NHS are the real heroes!\u2019 Yeah, we already know that, you\u2019re not bringing anything to the conversation.\u201d\nAvoiding those easy jokes can be difficult when events are either too absurd or too horrible to find humour in. Kumar says: \u201cWhen the health secretary gets coronavirus, you think: this is almost beyond comedy.\u201d\nWith \u201ccartoonish figures\u201d like Donald Trump, Kumar strives to go beyond obvious quips about hair or fake tan: \u201cThey\u2019re not fringe candidates, they\u2019re the most powerful men in the world. We\u2019re always trying to write jokes that treat them with the appropriate level of seriousness.\u201d\nThe next few episodes of The Mash Report are set to be filmed under lockdown. Kumar and co are ready to make it funny for their captive audience: \u201cPrior to 2016, you had to convince people that politics was something they wanted to hear about \u2013 that was part of the trick of doing political comedy. Now, people understand the impact of politics, and corona has given them even more time to focus on being terrified by the news.\u201d\nThe Mash Report is on BBC Two on Fridays; Kiri Pritchard-McLean hosts Comedy at the Covid Arms online on Saturdays.",

        "content": "Donald Trump claims to have \u2018total authority\u2019 as he throws another presidential tantrum. Plus, how the coronavirus almost crashed the financial system\nGood morning, and welcome to a slightly different morning briefing. With First Thing, we want to focus more on the biggest story in the world right now \u2013 whatever that might be \u2013 and listen more closely to the voices of the Guardian journalists and experts who get to the bottom of the news every day.\nWe also want to make sure we keep looking beyond the coronavirus crisis to whatever else is happening in the US and around the world \u2013 plus some longer or lighter reads that might help to take your mind off the punishing news cycle. Speaking of which \u2026\nYes, Donald Trump devoted most of his Monday coronavirus press briefing not to the coronavirus, but to the press. The president opened his daily display of Trumpian id with a showreel of news clips compiled by White House staff, which he said highlighted the media\u2019s downplaying of the pandemic in its early stages, in contrast to his administration\u2019s supposed swift response.\nWhile he continues to insist the states are responsible for any failings in that response, Trump also claimed his own \u201cauthority is total\u201d when it comes to the lockdown rules and when to lift them. Clearly he felt wounded by the weekend\u2019s big New York Times story, which portrayed a president fumbling through January and February without a pandemic plan, writes David Smith:\nDonald Trump, starved of campaign rallies, Mar-a-Lago weekends and golf, and goaded by a bombshell newspaper report, couldn\u2019t take it any more. Years of accreted grievance and resentment towards the media came gushing out in a torrent.\n\u201cTotally under control\u201d. That\u2019s how Trump (dubiously) described the US\u2019s first Covid-19 outbreak back on 22 January. Tom McCarthy compiles a timeline of all the disinformation spread by the president about the coronavirus and the threat it poses.\nContrary to Trump\u2019s claims, it is the states which are taking the initiative about when and how to ease their coronavirus lockdowns. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Monday he believed the \u201cworst is over\u201d for New York, as he announced that his state would work with five others in the north-east to coordinate the relaxation of stay-at-home orders. California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar plan for the west coast.\nA crew member from the virus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt has died of complications related to the disease, the first active-duty military member to die of Covid-19.\nA Guardian analysis has found that the most polluted neighbourhoods in cities such as Los Angeles, Houston and Detroit, are also among the country\u2019s worst virus hotspots.\nSan Francisco has shut down a nightclub that continued to operate illegally during the lockdown, with the city attorney calling the club\u2019s actions \u201cthe epitome of irresponsibility\u201d.\nVladimir Putin has acknowledged Russia faces a \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d challenge from the coronavirus after recording 2,558 new cases on Monday \u2013 the country\u2019s highest daily figure to date. Emmanuel Macron admitted failings in the French response as he extended the country\u2019s lockdown for another month.\nIn Brazil, Dom Phillips hears from residents of Rio\u2019s favelas who say they have been abandoned to face the crisis alone. But Helena Smith has better news from Greece, where \u2013 despite a decade of health cuts \u2013 efforts to flatten the curve appear to be paying off.\nMoon rises in South Korea. As South Korea becomes the first country to hold a national election in the shadow of the coronavirus, his government\u2019s widely praised handling of the pandemic should boost president Moon Jae-in\u2019s chances. But the nation\u2019s first feminist party is also hoping to win seats.\nA surveillance surge. Billions of people around the world face enhanced monitoring to combat the spread of the virus. And the Guardian\u2019s correspondents say those extraordinary measures may prove difficult to roll back later.\nThe Guardian and Kaiser Health News are combining to try to document the life of every doctor, nurse, hospital cleaner or EMT who dies in the US from Covid-19 during the pandemic. If you know a healthcare worker who has died, we\u2019d like you to share their story.\nMedical staff are being laid off. Remarkably, in the midst of a pandemic, workers in the US\u2019s for-profit healthcare sector are facing furloughs, layoffs and salary cuts.\nBiden wins in Wisconsin. Almost a week after the state controversially went ahead with its primary vote, the former vice president was declared its victor. He also received a warm endorsement from his erstwhile rival Bernie Sanders, making him the presumptive Democratic nominee.\nDeadly storms ravage the south. The Easter weekend\u2019s extreme weather has killed at least 30 people in the southern US, after bringing tornadoes, flooding and mudslides to a swath of states from Texas to West Virginia.\nChernobyl is burning. Well, almost. A huge wildfire in Ukraine is inching ever closer to the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history \u2013 and to a disposal site for radioactive waste.\nAnother plague \u2026 of locusts. A biblical swarm is threatening food security in east Africa, with experts predicting a fresh plague of the insects, 20 times worse than the one that descended on the region just two months ago.\nNick Offerman: \u2018If you\u2019re not offending anyone, it\u2019s not art\u2019\nBest known for his comedy chops, Nick Offerman was surprised when he got the call to star in Alex Garland\u2019s new sci-fi drama, Devs. But thanks to his background in theatre, he tells Stuart Heritage, \u201cI have experience on stage of making people laugh, certainly \u2013 but also making people cringe, vomit and sob.\u201d\nHow coronavirus almost brought down the financial system\nCovid-19 has brought the global financial system to a grinding halt, leaving millions out of work and the world on the brink of a yawning depression. But after tossing out conservative wisdom and intervening on a vast scale, writes Adam Tooze, governments have averted a full-scale meltdown \u2013 if only for the time being.\nAn unfortunate executive from a French defence firm got the shock of his life last March, after colleagues presented him with the \u201cgift\u201d of a ride in a fighter jet \u2013 from which he accidentally ejected himself at approximately 1,300 feet and 320mph. Fortunately, the 64-year-old\u2019s parachute deployed automatically, and he landed safely in a field near the town of Saint-Dizier.\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

        "content": "The night many Sunderland fans heard the Roker Roar for the first time and our team felt like they mattered \nWhat stands out still is the silences. After every line of every chant, the silence was complete: everybody was joining in, nobody shuffling or muttering, 26,000 people united. We\u2019d heard the stories, of course. We knew about the Roker Roar. We thought we\u2019d heard it \u2013 but we hadn\u2019t, not till then, not till the night Sunderland beat Chelsea to reach the 1992 FA Cup semi-final.\nThe sense that something extraordinary might be happening came with a 3-2 win at West Ham in a fifth-round replay. We were second division, hopeless. Denis Smith had been sacked at Christmas and his assistant Malcolm Crosby, who looked like Robin Williams playing the wacky manager of a toy shop in an oversized prosthetic nose, took over on a caretaker basis. Then we nicked a draw at Chelsea with a late John Byrne header. None of this made any sense. We clearly weren\u2019t any good but somehow, in the Cup, fortune seemed with us.\nThen suddenly we were good. On a blustery night, Sunderland had much the better of the first half and took the lead through Peter Davenport, tucking in the rebound after Dave Beasant had saved from Byrne. But in the second half, Sunderland\u2019s legs went. Chelsea battered us. Tony Norman made save after save. Paul Bracewell twice cleared off the line. Tony Cascarino headed against the woodwork. Second by agonising second the clock ticked down. When a Dennis Wise header somehow deflected over the bar off Norman\u2019s chest, that most treacherous of thoughts began to creep in: it\u2019s our night.\nAnd then, with six minutes to go, Wise equalised. My thought then was that it would be best to get it done, lose before extra time, when, exhausted, we might easily lose by three or four \u2013 and we didn\u2019t deserve that. But then Byrne swept a long diagonal into the box, David Rush slipped and Frank Sinclair conceded a needless corner.\nBrian Atkinson slung it in. Gordon Armstrong, with his great shiny forehead, met it. I was at the other end of the ground, almost 150 yards away. The ball hung. For an eternity it hung. I could see Beasant dive but the perspective was wrong. It hung for ever, largely because it hadn\u2019t been apparent that Armstrong was 15 yards out when he met the cross. Then the Roker End, given up that night entirely to Chelsea fans (my dad, annoyed at being kicked out of his usual spot, refused to go as a consequence), slumped in unison and we knew it was in.\nThere was pandemonium. There were still three or four minutes to be played but nobody saw much of it. I remember John Kay nailing Vinnie Jones and giving away a free-kick in a dangerous position to make some hardman-on-hardman point.\nThen it was over, and there was a pitch invasion which, looking at the video, featured a surprising amount of turquoise. A huge red-and-white striped banner was passed down from the back of the Fulwell End and out on to the pitch, to which somebody struck up a chant of \u201cMalcolm Crosby\u2019s red-and-white hankie\u201d. And for the first time in my experience, there was a profound sense that we mattered, that the country would be watching us.\nSunderland went on to beat Norwich in the semi-final and so we got our day out against Liverpool at Wembley, by which time Crosby had been given the job full-time. Sunderland were barely in the game and lost 2-0. But the quarter-final replay lives on, my generation\u2019s equivalent of the 3-1 fifth-round replay win over Manchester City in 1973, our night.\nAs I walked home \u2013 alone, thanks to my dad\u2019s ludicrous cussedness \u2013 there were people celebrating: in pubs, in the streets, in their gardens. And they\u2019d see your scarf and they\u2019d ask if you\u2019d been there and you could say you were, as if you\u2019d had some part in it, and at the time it seemed the most important thing in the world.",

I woke up the next morning, and I was like: \u2018This is not real life\u2019,\u201d says McLaughlin.\nAfter placing fifth in her semi-final, she failed to progress to the final, but the experience was significant for McLaughlin. \u201cI think it actually took me going to Rio to understand that, OK, this one is out of the way \u2026 now I can really go to the Olympics,\u201d says McLaughlin, who is now 20.\nFor the past four years, Tokyo 2020 has been her primary focus, her chance to have the full Olympic experience. And everything seemed to be lining up perfectly.\nMcLaughlin ended the 2019 season by reaching the 400m hurdles final at the world championships in Doha. The race was a showdown with her US teammate, and Olympic champion, Dalilah Muhammad. Though McLaughlin surged towards the end of the race, Muhammad maintained her lead, setting a new world record with McLaughlin only 0.07 seconds behind in second.\n\u201cAnyone would be upset falling a little bit short, but to end it with a half a second PR and that close to the world record, I couldn\u2019t really complain. And it was perfect timing setting it up for this year,\u201d says McLaughlin.\nThere was no doubt. McLaughlin was ready for the Tokyo Games, but there was something out of her control. At the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 swept across the world, upending nearly every facet of society and ultimately resulting in the postponement of the Olympics until 2021.\nMcLaughlin, like other professional athletes, said she understands why the Games were postponed. \u201cPersonally, I agree with the decision,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cAlthough it is unfortunate for all the athletes who have been working so hard up until this point, the safety and wellbeing of athletes, fans and coaches should be the first priority.\u201d\nMcLaughlin is using the extra time to her advantage. \u201cThis just gives us more time to prepare mentally and physically,\u201d she says.\nOnce her normal training schedule resumes, she will focus on the little things, like hurdle technique, stride pattern and confidence going into the first hurdle. These seemingly small details can add up to major gains in a race that lasts less than a minute.\nThough workouts are different during times of social distancing, technology has enabled McLaughlin to remain connected to her teammates and coach, Joanna Hayes. Hayes, who won the gold medal in the 100m hurdles at the 2004 Olympics, says she draws on her past successes and mistakes when coaching McLaughlin.\n\u201cThere are times when I\u2019m like, \u2018I did that, we\u2019re not going to do that. She\u2019s not going to make that same mistake,\u2019\u201d says Hayes, who has been coaching McLaughlin since November 2018.\nIn just over a year, they have already gelled, forging a relationship that extends beyond that of coach and athlete. The energy between them is focused and driven, while simultaneously lighthearted and carefree. McLaughlin describes Hayes \u2013 her first female coach\u2013 as nurturing and caring.\n\u201cSyd knows that I have her complete best interest at heart, not just on the track but in life. I am not going to steer her wrong,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell her what\u2019s best for Sydney not Sydney McLaughlin.\u201d\nHayes says she is careful not to overwhelm McLaughlin. The goal is not necessarily to win gold or set a world record right away. There is plenty of time for that. Instead, the focus is simply on ensuring that McLaughlin is consistently faster with every race \u2013 which was the case in 2019.\n\u201cWinning races comes and goes, and records come and go with it,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cEvery year, the only goal I set for myself is to beat my own times. I try to be better each year than I was the last.\u201d\nMaintaining balance is also important to McLaughlin, who, with the help of Hayes, prioritizes time to pursue passions and interests outside of running. \u201cShe understands that at the end of the day I\u2019m 20, and there are things that I want to go do in life. She\u2019s very open to fitting those things in and making the process fun,\u201d says McLaughlin.\nLast summer, after the Wanda Diamond League competition in Monaco, the duo traveled throughout France. Driving to the summit of a mountain in Marseilles was a highlight for McLaughlin, who said she appreciates having time to enjoy race destinations instead of simply running and going home.\nRecently her sponsor, New Balance, supported McLaughlin in launching her own YouTube channel, which gives her subscribers a peek into her training journey and the more personal \u2013 and goofy \u2013 side of \u2018Syd the Kid.\u2019 McLaughlin is also active on Instagram, where she has amassed almost 500,000 followers. There she posts pictures and videos of herself modeling her latest fashion finds, displaying her impressive juggling skills and cuddling with her new Goldendoodle.\nThat\u2019s not the only new thing in McLaughlin\u2019s life. Over the past four years, she graduated high school, competed for the University of Kentucky for one year before becoming a professional athlete, moved to Los Angeles and learned how to drive a car \u2013 a Mercedes she calls Chili.\nHer transition to the west coast was made easier by having her athletic family close by. For her first year in California, her mom, who ran in high school, lived with her, and now she periodically visits from New Jersey. Both of McLaughlin\u2019s brothers have also moved to Los Angeles \u2013 only a couple blocks away from her. McLaughlin\u2019s brother Taylor, who placed second in the 400m hurdles in the 2016 Under-20 World Championships, even trains alongside her, just as they did when they were kids.\nAs McLaughlin now looks toward the Olympics in 2021, she says her accomplishments have kept her grounded. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m halfway through my story, but technically it\u2019s just starting. It\u2019s really motivating to know that we\u2019ve done this, and there\u2019s still so much more to do.\u201d",

        "content": "The Wisconsin city has a reputation for being the country\u2019s most segregated, and it\u2019s made clear in the pandemic numbers\nTasha Colbert of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, thinks of her 83-year-old grandmother Loraine as a pillar of the family. \u201cMy grandmother is like my mother; she raised me.\u201d But for the past two weeks, the matriarch has been battling Covid-19 in the intensive care unit at Community Memorial hospital.\nLoraine\u2019s fight with Covid-19 started with a slight fever. But after her condition worsened, Colbert said her grandmother, who already has chronic lung disease, has been on a breathing machine, and family members are not allowed to see her in person. \u201cTo me the isolation is what can kill more than anything,\u201d Colbert said.\nColbert\u2019s grandmother lives on the north side of Milwaukee, a predominantly African American part of a city whose black residents are carrying much of the load of the novel coronavirus, and suffer worse outcomes. As of 9 April, the state of Wisconsin had more than 2,500 positive coronavirus cases, 1,500 of which are in Milwaukee county. Milwaukee is among the most segregated cities in the US.\nThe disparity in the city of Milwaukee is clear. Census data shows that black people comprise about 41% of the city\u2019s population, yet they have nearly half of the city\u2019s Covid-19 cases. And 44 of the 67 people who have died in the county were black. Most live on the city\u2019s north side.\nThe way the pandemic has hit the black community here has some people asking why this is happening. But local health experts and community activists are not surprised, given the health and economic disparities black people in Wisconsin face.\nWisconsin has the highest black-white unemployment gap in the US. Black men and women have higher rates of heart disease mortality, and nearly 34% of black people in Milwaukee live below the poverty line. Additionally, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that 9% of black people in Wisconsin were uninsured in 2018, which means they probably had even less access to basic healthcare already.\n\u201cI think any place you see, any community you\u2019re in, if you have a group of poor people and discriminated against people, their ability to withstand anything coming in, let alone something as devastating as Covid, it\u2019s going to affect them here,\u201d said Dr Patricia McManus, the director of the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin, Inc, an advocacy group.\nMcManus, who is 71, is herself part of the at-risk age group more likely to develop severe illness from Covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMeanwhile, Milwaukee\u2019s reputation for being one of the most segregated cities in the country plays a part, as well. \u201cYou\u2019ve got urban communities in which black people are more likely to live than white people ... that are often quite densely populated,\u201d said Joshua Garoon is an assistant professor of community and environmental sociology at University of Wisconsin in Madison. Density makes the virus spread more quickly.\nThe Milwaukee health commissioner, Jeanette Kowalik, said government officials are mainly using technology to get much of the Covid-19 messaging out through social media. In 2018, about 10% of black people in the city had no internet subscription, and over 12% of black people in Milwaukee didn\u2019t have a computer at all.\nKowalik added that there is another challenge facing public health efforts in the city: getting some black people to take the coronavirus seriously. \u201cMessaging was out there, but people were thinking, \u2018Oh it didn\u2019t pertain to me because I\u2019m not traveling, or I didn\u2019t know anybody that went to China\u2019,\u201d Kowalik says.\nBut local activist Vaun Mayes said that attitude has a lot to do with lack of government outreach. \u201cThat has, I know, caused a huge effect as far as how serious people take it here on the north side,\u201d he said.\nTeran Powell is a race and ethnicity reporter for Milwaukee\u2019s NPR affiliate, WUWM, where you can check out more of their coverage of the city\u2019s coronavirus outbreak.",

        "content": "UK survey of Gloucestershire flocks shows birds hang out in small social networks\nThe sight of tens of thousands of flamingos flocking together to create a huge pink cloud may be one of the wonders of the natural world but research suggests that within these vast congregations, individual birds form intimate, long-lasting friendship groups.\nA five-year study of captive flocks in Gloucestershire has found that flamingos spend large amounts of time with specific close \u201cfriends\u201d in groups of up to four or five.\nThe report says that some of these friendship groups appear to avoid others they do not get along with. No loners were spotted but some individuals, dubbed \u201csocial butterflies\u201d by the researchers, did flit from group to group.\nIt has long been known that gatherings of flamingos in the wild, which can number up to 2 million individuals, are complex social structures. It is also known that the birds have very different individual characteristics.\nSome are pushy and aggressive, barging their wayinto the middle of the best feeding areas, while others are quieter, feeding around the edge and trying to not get in other flamingo\u2019s way. But there are many mysteries, including how long pairs stick together.\nScientists from the University of Exeter studied about 350 birds, comprising four species, at the WWT Slimbridge wetland centre. The researchers have not yet been able to establish how long pairs mate for but did spot consistent friendship groups.\nDr Paul Rose, a zoologist and ornithologist, said: \u201cOur results indicate that flamingo societies are formed of long-standing friendships rather than loose, random connections.\n\u201cFlamingos don\u2019t simply find a mate and spend their time with that individual. We see pairs of males or females choosing to hang out, we see trios and quartets that are regularly together.\n\u201cFlamingos have long lives \u2013 some of the birds in this study have been at Slimbridge since the 1960s \u2013 and our study shows their friendships are stable over a period of years. It seems that, like humans, flamingos form social bonds.\u201d\nPrevious studies have found strong social networks in species ranging from zebra finches to red junglefowl. The vastness of flamingo groups in the wild means it is hard to study individuals or groups.\nFor the Gloucestershire study, ringed birds were photographed between three and four times a day to establish which were sticking together. The friendship groups identified contained between two and five individuals and were inevitably both male and female.\nThe study examined flocks of Caribbean, Chilean, Andean and lesser flamingos at the wetland centre. The flocks varied in size from just over 20 to more than 140.\nIt found that seasons affected social interactions, with more bonds forming in spring and summer \u2013 the breeding season. But the health of the birds did not seem to matter. They maintained their groupings even if one of them was not in tip-top condition.\nRose said sticking together in smaller groups could help the individuals find food, keep an eye out for predators and know when the whole flock was about to move.\nHe believes the same sort of social groupings identified at Slimbridge would happen in the wild and understanding the birds\u2019 inter-flock relationships could help conservation work.\nMore immediately it may inform how flamingos in captivity are cared for. \u201cWhen moving birds from one zoo to another, we should be careful not to separate flamingos that are closely bonded to each other,\u201d he said.\nThe findings are published in the journal Behavioural Processes.",

        "content": "Absence of normal rituals to say goodbye to loved ones can have profound impact\nOn a cold, bright day a couple of weeks ago, a hearse drew up at a crematorium in Leicestershire for the funeral of an elderly woman who had died of natural causes. Six pallbearers hoisted the coffin, decorated with spring flowers, on to their shoulders and carried it to the catafalque as Vaughan Williams\u2019 The Lark Ascending played.\nDuring a short ceremony, Sally-Ann Best, a civil celebrant, introduced music chosen by the family and read two poems. Between her, at the front of the crematorium chapel, and the funeral director standing respectfully at the back, there were rows of chairs. Every single one was empty.\nIt was a funeral with no mourners \u2013 and not for a lack of relatives and friends. The woman\u2019s family, most of whom lived 100 miles away, were unable to attend because of coronavirus restrictions.\nThey were among increasing numbers of grieving people who are being denied the opportunity to say a final goodbye to their loved ones, leaving celebrants, priests and funeral directors to stand in as \u201cproxy mourners\u201d.\nBest, a member of the Institute of Civil Funerals, said she felt \u201cvery protective of the lady who had died\u201d in the absence of family. \u201cThe words I was speaking seemed to be even more important; it was a massive mark of respect to go ahead with the ceremony even though I was the only person there.\u201d\nThe family told her \u201cit brought them some comfort to know that their mum was still having a dignified and respectful funeral service\u201d.\nGovernment guidelines, drawn up in conjunction with ethicists and faith leaders in recent weeks, permit close family members to attend funerals while observing physical distancing.\nThe Church of England has banned church funeral services, saying immediate family only may attend at gravesides, and that burials can be live streamed to other relatives and friends.\nAnd a number of local authorities have banned funeral ceremonies in crematoria and cemeteries. Instead they are offering only \u201cdirect cremations\u201d, in which there is no ceremony and mourners are not present, and burial services at gravesides, with a maximum of 10 mourners observing physical distancing guidelines.\nSome celebrants and funeral directors have called for an outright ban on ceremonies or clearer guidance, saying it is unfair to grieving families to have different rules applying in different parts of the country.\nMaggie Kinloch, a registered celebrant and chair of the Humanist Society Scotland, said the impact on grieving relatives of being unable to attend funerals would be profound and last a long time.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the moment is a generalised sense of grief across the world \u2013 not just for those we\u2019ve loved and lost, but for our own ability to get on with our lives. This veneer of grief is massively compounded when a family lose someone they love. It\u2019s grief upon grief. If you are unable to attend their funeral, it\u2019s yet another layer of grief.\n\u201cFamilies want to give their relatives the best possible celebration of their life, surrounded by people who knew them. The comfort of hugs and handshakes is hugely important.\n\u201cThese life rituals are shared acts of community. We want and need people with us to mark these significant moments in our lives.\u201d\nMichael Cooper from Durham was unable to attend his mother\u2019s funeral after she died aged 87 last month. The ceremony was livestreamed to him and other close family, but he said he was left with feelings of guilt and shame.\n\u201cYou should be there at the end, and I wasn\u2019t. I felt ashamed in case other people were judging me. This is what was in my head \u2013 guilt and shame,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe ceremony was impeccable, except there was no one there who should have been there. I felt my mother was alone.\u201d\nThe funeral of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13-year-old boy from Brixton, south London, who died of Covid-19, took place earlier this month without any immediate family present after his mother and six siblings went into isolation.\nMark Stephenson, a friend of the family who delivered a short speech on behalf of the family, said the child\u2019s relatives were devastated they could not attend.\nCruse, the bereavement charity, said it had already been contacted by people in distress over being unable to attend funerals, and it expected many more to calls its helpline in the coming weeks.\n\u201cThe rituals of saying goodbye to people we love are really important. The added complication for those in grief at the moment is the backdrop of countless other unattended funerals, the constant noise of news coverage, worries about their own health, income loss, children needing home-schooling,\u201d said Andy Langford, clinical director of the charity.\n\u201cSome people are saying they feel so numb they can\u2019t express any feeling. Others find it comforting to know other people are going through a similar experience. Grief is individual.\u201d",

Asked by Bolt why he thinks the complainant made the allegations, Pell said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder whether he was used,\u201d Pell continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this poor fellow was up to.\u201d He did not elaborate on who the complainant may have been used by. But he spoke of corruption in the Vatican, and also made allegations of corruption in Victoria. Pell said he was unpopular among some Vatican officials for his efforts to get the institution\u2019s finances in order. Asked by Bolt \u201chow high up the corruption goes\u201d, Pell responded: \u201cWho knows.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Victoria,\u201d Pell said. \u201cYou\u2019re not quite sure where the vein runs, how thick and broad it is, and how high it goes.\u201d Asked if police had persecuted him, Pell said: \u201cWell I think the onus is on them, in the face of that evidence, to show why that\u2019s not true.\u201d\nPell has moved from Victoria to Sydney since being released from jail last Tuesday, and is staying at a seminary in Homebush. On Tuesday it was revealed by the Herald Sun that Pell is being investigated by Victoria police in relation to a new allegation.\nBolt accused Victoria police and the ABC of engaging in a witch-hunt. In what was a soft interview, Bolt said there was a campaign against Pell that \u201cwas like Salem it was so primitive\u201d.\nPell said \u201cI\u2019m the scapegoat that\u2019s copped most of this\u201d. He said his actions setting up the Melbourne Response \u2013 the scheme established by the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne in 1996 to respond to allegations of sexual abuse within the church \u2013 had not been adequately recognised.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the church has ever got enough credit for the fact we broke the back of this problem [child sexual abuse],\u201d Pell said. \u201cIt stopped. Not completely.\u201d Bolt did not press Pell about the numerous issues raised about the Melbourne Response by child sexual abuse survivors when Australia held a five-year-long royal commission into institutional responses to abuse. Survivors described the Melbourne Response as biased against victims and designed to dissuade victims from pursuing legal action.\nBolt described the royal commission as \u201cextremely hostile\u201d towards Pell.\nThe royal commission\u2019s findings about Pell have never been released due to the previous criminal trial. Now that the appeals process is complete, there have been calls including from politicians for the findings from that report to be made public. Pell told Bolt he would \u201cbe very surprised if\u201d, when the report is made public, \u201cthere were any bad findings against me at all\u201d.\nPell told the royal commission in 2016 that although he lived and worked alongside the notorious paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale in the 1970s, Ridsdale\u2019s abusing \u201cwas a sad story and of not much interest to me\u201d. \u201cI had no reason to turn my mind to the evils Ridsdale had perpetrated,\u201d he told the commission.\nPell told Bolt that Ridsdale had \u201cdone an immense amount of harm\u201d. \u201cHe acknowledges that and regrets it\u201d. However, prosecutors have questioned Ridsdale\u2019s remorse, given he failed to confess to crimes that would have meant his victims could have avoided a drawn-out legal process. Pell was not grilled by Bolt about his actions when he shared a house with Ridsdale, or when he sat on a committee of priests who made decisions to move Ridsdale from parish to parish. Pell accompanied Ridsdale to court when he was finally charged.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trained to think well of people and I don\u2019t regret that,\u201d Pell told Bolt. \u201cWe\u2019re trained not to believe gossip unless it\u2019s established. Most don\u2019t run around detailing the faults of others. Back then, the first instinct would be to disbelieve [allegations].\u201d\nHe said it was not unusual for police to work with priests to move offenders from parish to parish.\n\u201cSometimes \u2026 the police would work with the bishop to move the person on to deal with it,\u201d Pell said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as though we were alone in this.\u201d\nPell said now that he was free he planned to stay in Sydney, with a little bit of travel to Rome.\n\u201cI\u2019m 14 years past retirement age in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go quietly. I\u2019ll probably do a little bit of writing, keep reading, I\u2019ll certainly stay in Sydney. I might go to Rome for a while. I might grow a few cabbages, and a few roses and things.\u201d",

        "content": "Latest World Economic Outlook describes shock of coronavirus pandemic as \u2018like no other\u2019\nThe International Monetary Fund has slashed its forecasts for global growth in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and warned of a slump in output this year unparalleled since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nIn its half-yearly forecasts, the IMF said the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d would cause a dramatic drop in activity that would be far more painful than the recession that followed the banking meltdown of the late 2000s.\nThe IMF said the sudden shock caused by the spread of the coronavirus meant it had been forced to tear up an estimate it made just three months ago of 3.3% global growth this year and replace it with an expected contraction of 3%.\nUntil now the downturn that followed the near meltdown of the global financial system in late 2008 has been the most serious of the postwar era, with global activity shrinking by 0.1% in 2009\nGross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of activity in the economy over a given period of time.\u00a0\nPut simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing; if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.\u00a0\nGDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.\u00a0\nThe ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number.\n\u2022 The value of all goods and services produced \u2013 known as the output or production measure.\u2022\u00a0The value of the income generated from company profits and wages \u2013 known as the income measure.\u2022\u00a0The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas \u2013 known as the expenditure measure.\nEconomists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation.\nBritain's government statistics body, the\u00a0Office for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.\u00a0\nThe ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.\u00a0\nThe most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year; for the three months to March, June, September and December.\nThe figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here. GDP per capita shows whether we are actually getting richer or poorer, by stripping out the impact of population changes.\u00a0Richard Partington\nBigger output losses have now been pencilled in for 2020, concentrated in the rich economies of the west, which are forecast to shrink by 6.1% on average. Italy and Spain \u2013 the two worst-affected European economies from Covid-19 so far \u2013 will see GDP falls of 9.1% and 8%, respectively, the IMF said in its world economic outlook. Britain\u2019s drop in output is put at 6.5%.\nOf the big emerging economies, China\u2019s growth rate is expected to fall from 6.1% last year to 1.2% in 2020 \u2013 its lowest in decades. India is on course to expand by 1.9%, down from 4.2%.\nAdjusted to take account of population changes, the IMF\u2019s forecasts were even gloomier. Gross domestic product (GDP) per head \u2013 one measure of living standards \u2013 is expected to fall globally by 4.2% in 2020, by 6.5% in advanced countries, and by 7% in the UK.\nGita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said the size of the hit to the global economy, uncertainty about the how long the shock would last, and the need to discourage economic activity to contain the virus had to led to a crisis \u201clike no other\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cIt is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago. \u2018The Great Lockdown\u2019, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.\u201d\nThe IMF is predicting a partial recovery in 2021, when it is estimating that growth will recover to 5.6%, but Gopinath said the level of GDP would remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound.\nShe warned: \u201cMuch worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely.\u201d\nThe IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook (WEO) is assuming that economic disruptions are concentrated mostly in the second quarter of 2020 for almost all countries except China (where the impact was most intense in the first quarter). The time taken for production to be scaled back up means the sharp plunge in output will be followed by only a gradual recovery.\nThe IMF said its forecasts were highly uncertain and that the risks were that the economic cost of the pandemic would be worse than currently envisaged. Recovery relied on stimulus measures being effective in preventing widespread company bankruptcies, limiting job losses, and easing financial strains.\nThe WEO modelled three alternative scenarios: a 2020 lockdown lasting 50% longer than it is forecasting; a mild recurrence of the virus in 2021; and a protracted pandemic and longer containment effort in 2020, as well as a recurrence in 2021.\nIn the worst case, the global economy would shrink by around 11% rather than 3%.\nGopinath said: \u201cThe economic landscape will be altered significantly for the duration of the crisis and possibly longer, with greater involvement of government and central banks in the economy.\u201d\nAt a time when Italy and Spain have started to lift their lockdown restrictions, Gopinath said: \u201cThere are many reasons for optimism, despite the dire circumstances. In countries with major outbreaks, the number of new cases has come down, after strong social distancing practices were put in place. The unprecedented pace of work on treatments and vaccines also promises hope. The swift and substantial economic policy actions taken in many countries will help shield people and firms, preventing even more severe economic pain and create the conditions for the recovery.\u201d\nAlthough the effects of the pandemic have been more severe so far in developed countries, the IMF said they were better equipped to cope. It added that many emerging and developing economies faced a multilayered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital flight, and collapsing commodity prices.",

        "content": "Available onlineThe labyrinthine corridors of Battersea Arts Centre become a rabbit hole of live acts in this bewitching single-take film\nThe Way Out, part of the BBC\u2019s Performance Live strand, is set within the bricks-and-mortar reality of Battersea Arts Centre, with a camera capturing the drama in one unbroken shot. This might have given the 40-minute film a gritty, documentary feel but the story quickly slips into less solid space and drops down a rabbit hole.\nOur latter-day Alice (Bl\u00e1ith\u00edn Mac Gabhann), named only as the Outsider, enters the building at night to find it alive with entertainment. The white rabbit figure is played by Omid Djalili, a Guide dressed in the red coat and hat of an impresario, and Wonderland is what Mac Gabhann finds along the labyrinthine corridors and halls of the arts venue.\nDjalili quotes Lewis Carroll to drive the point home as he and a silent Mac Gabhann stumble across seemingly impromptu live acts. There is song, dance, spoken word, cabaret, hula-hooping and acrobatics, all strung together in a structure that imitates an immersive theatre show, with snatches of dialogue between the acts.\nIt is a curious adventure indeed, and might easily have become clumsy in its central endeavour to showcase the talents of the performers who appear around the next corner. But it works, wondrously, and if the idea of capturing the magic of live performance though the static medium of film sounds like a contradiction in terms, Suri Krishnamma\u2019s production pulls it off and builds to some bewitching moments.\nThe uninterrupted \u201csingle-take\u201d filming helps to give it a seamlessness and fluidity that conjures the sense of an organic, moving show, without becoming giddy or breathless.\nDjalili is a co-writer, along with Krishnamma and Nicholas Mark Harding, and his character talks in endless \u2013 and initially infuriating \u2013 oxymorons (\u201cwe need to go up to go down\u201d, \u201cthe longest way round is the shortest way home\u201d and so on). But he wins us over with comic vulnerability: \u201cI look in the mirror and see a wizened, short, fat kebab-shop owner\u2019s son \u2026 but inside me there\u2019s a thin, high cheek-boned, flamboyant luvvie.\u201d\nThere is one showstopper after another within the performances: Botis Seva emerges as a misshapen shadow along a corridor and his hip-hop infused choreography in Quicksand grows into a mesmerising series of staggers, flails and falls. Le Gateau Chocolat sits in a cavernous room, a melancholic figure in folds of fabric, and sings a stunning solo, Liminal. Sanah Ahsan\u2019s fierce performance poetry, Come As You Are, is set to Sam Pe\u00f1a\u2019s improvised piano music and is an exhilarating declaration of love and an invocation to bare the soul.\nThe Grade II-listed building in which it is set \u2013 damaged by fire in 2015 \u2013 adds to the romance. Its frescoes are shown alongside its pockmarks, exposed pipes and crumbling plaster, and there is glory in the unvarnished beauty.\nAs a show, it is unapologetically sentimental in its message about the transformative power of performance. It\u2019s not the destination but the journey that counts, say Djalili in another of his paradoxes. But it reminds us of the journey that performance takes us on, imaginatively, and it leaves us with yearning.\nAvailable to watch on BBC iPlayer.",

        "content": "From lockdown in Dublin, the actor talks about working with the makers of Fleabag on his new show Run and the shadow of his famous father\nIt\u2019s 2.15pm on a Wednesday afternoon when I ask Domhnall Gleeson what he\u2019s wearing. With face-to-face interviews abandoned in favour of the telephone, and the actor confined to his Dublin home, Gleeson could have made up something classy. Instead, though, he opts for total honesty: \u201cOh shit, this is embarrassing.\u201d\nGleeson is, in fact, sat on his bed in a pair of pyjama-adjacent bottoms his mum got him a few years back for Christmas, and a scruffy T-shirt that \u2013 looking down to jog his memory \u2013 he realises is on inside out. He recently finished shooting a Channel 4 sitcom in which he plays Doofus. His haircut, Gleeson says, perfectly suits the name.\nReally, he assures me, most days have gone better. He\u2019s getting dressed, going for walks within the prescribed 2km radius. It\u2019s just this afternoon that he is still in bed, looking like a Lego man in his pyjamas.\nLazing around the house in Dublin is something of a novelty for the 36-year-old. He has been busy the past few years, appearing in three Star Wars films, Peter Rabbit and its 2021 sequel, and the widely slated The Kitchen, which we will place to one side. Soon there will be Frank of Ireland (with its aforementioned haircut) and Run, the much-anticipated HBO comedy-romance-thriller created and written by Vicky Jones \u2013 director of the original Fleabag stage show \u2013 and produced by her long-time collaborator Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\nGleeson and Merritt Wever (Nurse Jackie, Godless) play exes with an escape plan from the new lives they have created since their breakup. On receiving a one-word text, both know a time and location at which to meet. From there they attempt to rekindle their love affair. That is, if the other decides to show up.\nAside from an episode of Black Mirror and a handful of sketches, Gleeson has, until recently, steered clear of television. You can end up treading water while nothing happens in TV, he says, unlike films, which have to be wrapped up by the credits. In Run, though, Gleeson saw something different: a pilot script full of energy and excitement, although he makes no secret of the fact it was Waller-Bridge\u2019s name which first got his attention.\nThe writer and star of Fleabag arrived on the shoot halfway through filming in Toronto and then out on location. \u201cIt\u2019s such a funny thing to throw more praise at Phoebe,\u201d he says. Yes, she\u2019s talented, funny and quick on her feet; her reputation for being one of the most skilled people in her field is well-deserved. \u201cBut,\u201d he asks, \u201cwho the fuck needs to read more people speaking about how unbelievably amazing she is?\u201d\nHe could just say she was crap ...\n\u201cYeah fuck it, let\u2019s go big and give people something to read about. She hits people; she\u2019s got body odour. I\u2019m not really sure where to go with this \u2026 No, she didn\u2019t hit anyone that I saw, and as far as I can remember she smelt lovely.\u201d At least he tried.\nDespite the considerable hype around the release \u2013 it is Jones\u2019s first big post-Fleabag project \u2013 Gleeson says he didn\u2019t feel a heightened sense of pressure being a leading man with all eyes watching. And to be fair, with roles in both Star Wars and the Harry Potter \u2013 two of the biggest movie franchises of all time \u2013 he is used to high expectations. Instead, he says, the names on the script were a comfort.\nGleeson is more tuned in than he would usually be to Run\u2019s critical reception, now that there\u2019s little he can do to distract himself; nothing stopping him clicking on links to reviews he otherwise might avoid. But whatever the reaction, the momentum of Run\u2019s train-based storyline is maintained with the tense, fizzing on-screen chemistry between the lead characters. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing when people talk about chemistry and worrying about it. I\u2019ve never thought: \u2018Oh shit, I wonder if I\u2019ll have good chemistry with X person.\u201d He reckons if you work hard and try to be generous \u2013 as long as your partner has some talent \u2013 the rest looks after itself.\nAnd Gleeson is quick to praise Wever\u2019s talent, even if he\u2019s unsure about their off-screen relationship. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I really know Merritt at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI think she would probably say that I don\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s not to say they didn\u2019t get on; Gleeson definitely enjoyed her company. He just often finds himself meeting people he has worked with after finishing a job \u2013 from Margot Robbie to Saoirse Ronan \u2013 and thinking: \u201cJesus, they\u2019re totally different to how I remember them.\u201d\nMaybe Gleeson has got a bad memory, or more likely he is just not a fan of the showbiz life. That could explain why he steered clear of a move to Hollywood, instead opting to stick around in Ireland close to friends and family \u2013 a family that casts a long shadow.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for Gleeson to object to talking about his dad, Brendan, in interviews. Constantly being compared with your Emmy-award-winning actor father could become irritating. But Gleeson Jr clearly admires his dad greatly, bringing him up twice of his own accord.\nRight before we speak, he had been listening to Gleeson Sr discussing on the radio how Ireland is coping with coronavirus. A few years ago, Brendan appeared on national television to talk about the sorry state of the country\u2019s underfunded health service. \u201cHe was on again today saying how proud he is that people in Ireland have come together to flatten the curve.\u201d His son agrees.\nAnd when talking about his tendency to be overly self-critical (something he wonders if he should have just never have mentioned during previous interviews: \u201cEveryone feels it\u201d), he compares his work ethic with that of his father. Stepping into a parent\u2019s shoes makes him work harder. The pair are close; Dad is always on hand for advice.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in which he is a hindrance. I was aware, when I\u2019d turn up on stuff, that there\u2019d be a certain amount of: \u2018Maybe he got the job because of who is dad is,\u2019 or whatever. But it\u2019s hard to make a film or a play happen, and if anyone has spent money on anything they\u2019re not going to hire someone who can\u2019t do the job just because they know your dad.\u201d\nPossibly, he adds, that was naive. Still, he never considered using a different surname when starting out, in an effort to distance himself from his father. Brendan Gleeson was less of a name during his son\u2019s early years in the industry, he suggests, and everyone in Ireland \u2013 where Domhnall cut his teeth \u2013 would have known anyway.\n\u201cMaybe it would have been nice to take my mam\u2019s surname just to get it out there. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m just not a good-enough son that it crossed my mind.\u201d\nDespite appearing in his fair share of dystopian sci-fi, he fears none have helped him prepare for this pandemic. He has got a few projects to keep himself busy enough for now \u2013 and he\u2019s excited about a play he was due to appear in this year, although he won\u2019t tell me more in case it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping and trusting that people will still want to go to the theatre on the far side of this,\u201d he says, \u201cThat there is another side.\u201d When we emerge, he believes, people will still want to go to the cinema and to the theatre. The Jackass film was on TV last night; seeing it at the cinema was the most communal event he has ever experienced. Everyone laughing and talking, holding each other; praying they wouldn\u2019t do that thing with sandpaper. \u201cWe have to be responsible now, but we\u2019ll get back to those things. We\u2019ll want to experience stories; to laugh and cry together.\u201d\nUntil then though, Gleeson\u2019s going to focus on the small victories, such as getting out of his pyjamas more often.\n Run is on Sky Comedy and NOW TV, 15 April, 9pm",

At least two prospective buyers are thought to have come forward but a deal is unlikely to be finalised before the imminent administration.\nUncertainty around the coronavirus crisis is understood to have made a solvent sale impossible to conclude, according to Sky News.\nOasis and Warehouse\u2019s stores in the UK all closed temporarily last month under the government\u2019s lockdown aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus.\nThey continue to trade online. Staff are understood to have remained on full pay, and were not furloughed ahead of the insolvency process.\nThe talk of administration comes only days after Debenhams, a major stockist of Oasis and Warehouse fashions, also called in administrators as clothing retailers struggle to survive the high street shutdown.\nWarehouse, founded in 1976 by the designer Jeff Banks, and Oasis, which also first appeared in the 1970s, recorded sales of \u00a3293.2m in the year to March 2019, up 6.5%.

A slow starter academically, he failed his 11-plus but later managed to secure a place at Cowbridge grammar school, going on to study at what is now Queen Mary University London, and then at the University of London\u2019s Institute of Education, where he did his teacher training and became president of the student union. It was there that he also met and later married Eileen Darby, who was studying at nearby University College London.\nDoug worked as an English teacher in some of London\u2019s first comprehensive schools, including Eltham Green school in the south-east of the city. In 1967 he took up his post at Leicester, where he remained until his retirement in 1992.\nDuring the 1970s Doug had three books published in quick succession: Society, Schools and Humanity (1971), Beyond Curriculum (1973) and Education or Domination? (1974), the last of which contained contributions from some of the UK\u2019s top educationists and sociologists. Together they represented an important body of deeply philosophical and critical writings on education and society.\nDoug and Eileen divorced in 1979, and thereafter he lived alone. But he was never lonely \u2013 anyone who knew Doug would attest to his sociable personality. He gathered around him a wonderful group of friends, including many of his ex-students, and travelled extensively. Nobody loved a party more than Doug.\nHe was also active in a range of campaigning organisations, including CND, Campaign Against Arms Trade and Friends of the Earth.\nHe is survived by the three daughters from his marriage, Sue, Judi and Maggie.",

Strengthening the standards to 11 micrograms could save about 12,000 lives per year, according to one Harvard study of US seniors.\nOther research, noted in the government\u2019s own analysis, found that maintaining the soot standard at its current level could allow as many as 52,000 deaths a year in just 47 urban areas.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is now proposing to to freeze the standards. The move comes as experts warn the coronavirus pandemic is unequally devastating communities of color that have been disproportionately burdened by pollution. It also follows the announcement of laxer fuel-efficiency rules for cars and other efforts by Trump to advance his political agenda before the November election.\nThe agency is also retaining its current standard for coarse particle pollution.\nThe EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler on a call with reporters argued that the agency\u2019s science review \u201cidentified a number of uncertainties\u201d and based on those believes that \u201cthe current standard remains protective and does not need to be changed.\u201d\nRachel Fullmer, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, said: \u201cthe administration\u2019s effort to rush this action, without considering public input, is just the latest in a long line of attempts to ignore and undermine the science-based assessment required when [the government] establishes national standards.\u201d\nThe US government is required to consider new science in evaluating whether air pollution rules are strong enough every five years.\nWheeler disbanded the 26-member expert panel meant to review that research, appointing a smaller committee with less specific expertise in the pollutant to provide advice to the agency. Wheeler populated the committee with scientists from state-level agencies and industry \u2013 arguing they had long been underrepresented.\nEPA career staff have raised questions about whether the soot standard is protective enough, conflicting with the independent panel.",

It resulted in JP Morgan\u2019s earnings for the first three months of the year plunging 69% to $2.9bn compared with $9.2bn a year earlier.\nThe chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said the lender had had a strong start to the year but that JP Morgan needed to prepare for the realities of an economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak as well as the recent plunge in oil prices.\nDimon said: \u201cThe underlying results of the company were extremely good. However, given the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves of $6.8bn, resulting in total credit costs of $8.3bn for the quarter.\u201d\nThe bulk of the extra provisions \u2013 about $4.4bn \u2013 are meant to cover consumer loans that might go sour, most of which is expected to come from credit cards.\nThe remaining $2.4bn will help JP Morgan prepare for potential loan losses from business customers, with the largest losses expected from oil and gas companies, as well as real estate and retail.\nDimon said the bank was well-capitalised, with around $1tn worth of of liquid assets ready to be deployed to cover losses if necessary.\nHowever, analysts believe it is still too soon to predict how severe the economic downturn caused by coronavirus could be.\nNeil Wilson, the chief market analyst for Markets.com, said: \u201cThe bank is preparing for a severe recession and needs to set aside capital to cover expected losses \u2013 the problem is no one has a clue how big these might be.

        "content": "Cathedral can still be repaired by 2024, says general, but decisions must be made fast\nThe army general in charge of rebuilding Notre Dame has said it is still possible for the cathedral ravaged by fire exactly one year ago on Wednesday to reopen in 2024 as pledged by Emmanuel Macron, if everyone \u201crolls up their sleeves\u201d.\nJean-Louis Georgelin insisted unexpected delays in work to restore the 13th-century cathedral to its previous glory \u2013 including the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 need not derail the five-year deadline.\n\u201cIf everyone rolls up their sleeves and the work is well planned, it is conceivable that returning the cathedral to a place of worship within five years will not be an impossible feat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cObviously, the area around the cathedral will be far from finished, and perhaps the spire will not be completed, but the cathedral will once again be a place of worship and this is our aim.\u201d\nThe fire was discovered at 6.43pm local time on 15 April 2019, at the base of a 93-metre-high (305 ft) wood and lead spire added in 1859 by the architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. The flames quickly spread to the cathedral\u2019s ribbed roof, made up of hundreds of centuries-old oak beams known as la for\u00eat (the forest).\nAs it spread, horrified Parisians turned out to watch as flames roared from the edifice, lighting up the night sky. Just before 8pm, the spire collapsed onto part of the cathedral\u2019s vaulted transept.\nThe question of what do with the spire, a later addition, has raged since the days after the fire. Georgelin warned that arguments over whether it should be reconstructed as before or reflect a \u201ccontemporary gesture\u201d, as Macron suggested, risked slowing things down.\n\u201cWe have to be left to get on with the work and not caught up in the controversies,\u201d Georgelin told L\u2019Express magazine. \u201cThe quicker the decision is made about the spire, the quicker we will be able to really concentrate on the real reconstruction. It\u2019s important that the objectives are set.\u201d\nAbout 500 firefighters struggled for 15 hours to prevent the fire spreading from the roof to the two belfry towers housing the cathedral bells. If the tower\u2019s wooden frames had caught fire it could have sent the bells \u2013 including the largest Emmanuel bell weighing 13 tonnes \u2013 crashing down and collapsed the entire structure.\nThe fire was finally put out at 9.30am the following day. Two-thirds of the roof was destroyed, la for\u00eat was gone, part of the vaulted ceiling had collapsed and up to 400 tonnes of lead from the roof and spire had been reduced to dust, part of it dispersed to the wind \u2013 but Notre Dame was still standing.\nMacron immediately promised the shocked nation that the cathedral would be reborn in five years. \u201cWe will rebuild this cathedral. Together. It\u2019s part of our French destiny. I promise to do this,\u201d he said.\nSince then, the 40-strong public committee overseeing the restoration headed by Georgelin has faced a number of challenges. Work was halted last summer until lead contamination could be removed, then again in the autumn when Paris was hit by winds of up to 40km/h (25mph).\nSpecialist artisan builders, known as compagnons drawn from all over France to take part in the rebuilding operation, were sent home when France went into strict Covid-19 lockdown on 17 March.\nThe operation to remove the 40,000 tubes of damaged scaffolding that were around the spire at the time of the fire and collapsed with it, described by the committee as \u201ccomplex and spectacular\u201d and expected to take several months, was to have begun in March but was halted by the lockdown.\nGeorgelin said he was looking at ways for the work to partially restart. Although the building is still officially declared \u201cat peril\u201d, the general said monitoring equipment attached to different parts of the edifice showed it had not moved in the last year.\nAs for the three honey bee colonies on the roof of the sacristy, that almost miraculously escaped the flames and firefighting operation, their keeper Sibyle Moulin, said she visited them a week ago and the 30-45,000 bees were getting on with their cycle and \u201ccompletely unbothered\u201d.\nSpring is the time the queens mate and begin producing eggs to boost the colonies\u2019 numbers and the worker bees are busy finding food, she said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it was raining when I visited, but they all seem well. It\u2019s the busiest time of the year for them,\u201d Moulin said.",

Family and friends gathered on the streets to accompany the coffin carrying Rosario Sparacio, 70, the older brother of Luigi Sparacio, who was considered one of the most important heads of the Cosa Nostra in the 1990s and who eventually turned supergrass.\nThe news, first reported by the newspaper La Gazzetta del Sud, has sparked a row in Italy where since the beginning of March a government decree has banned all religious gatherings, including funerals and weddings, in order to contain the spread of Covid-19.\nIn the cities hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, coffins are awaiting burial, held in churches, and the corpses of those who have died at home are being kept in sealed rooms.\nClaudio Fava, the president of Sicily\u2019s anti-mafia commission, said: \u201cWhile in Italy there are no funerals and weddings how is it possible that in Messina dozens of people accompanied the dead body of the brother of a Mafia boss to the cemetery?\u201d\nFava, commenting on the photographs published by the local news website Messina Ora, said that behind the coffin \u201cthere were cars, motorbikes and friends\u201d.\nThe deceased man\u2019s brother, Luigi Sparacio, was once considered the most powerful mafioso in eastern Sicily and was very close to the Sicilian boss of bosses, Nitto Santapaola.

Appearing alongside him, the chief medical officer for England said they would stop testing people with mild suspected cases. \u201cWe will pivot all of the testing capacity to identifying people in hospitals who have symptoms,\u201d Chris Witty said.\nFour days later, the World Health Organization told countries battling Covid-19 that testing should form the backbone of their response to the pandemic. \u201cTest, test, test,\u201d said the body\u2019s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nBut one of England\u2019s deputy chief medical officers, Jenny Harries, dismissed this as a message aimed at less developed countries. \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention,\u201d she said.\nIn an apparent U-turn on the initial strategy, Hancock announced on 2 April a new aim of increasing testing to 100,000 a day by the end of the month.\nIn Monday\u2019s press conference, nearly five weeks after first turning away from a policy of testing outside a hospital setting, Whitty said: \u201cOne of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks.\u201d\nAfter first implying that they had not taken part in an EU scheme to source life-saving ventilators because the UK was \u201cmaking its own efforts\u201d after Brexit, Downing Street admitted on 26 March that it had failed to take part in the programme because it had accidentally missed the deadline. In another twist, it was then revealed that British officials had taken part in four meetings where EU projects to bulk-buy medical kit were discussed \u2013 the earliest of them in January.\nSpeaking to the BBC on 5 April, Hancock said the UK was on track to have ventilators for 18,000 patients, but admitted they may not be in place in time for the peak in hospital admissions \u2013 expected by the end of the month. He said that 1,500 ventilators should come into use in the NHS in the following week.\nHowever, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said on Monday that there had been an increase of just 200 in the previous seven days.\nAsked about the decision by countries including the US to advise people to wear face masks, England\u2019s other deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said on 3 April: \u201cIn terms of the hard evidence, and what the UK government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing.\u201d\nTwo weeks later, amid growing calls for the UK to change its advice, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told Monday\u2019s Downing Street press conference: \u201cThe evidence on masks is much more persuasive for masks stopping you giving it to somebody than it is for you preventing you catching it.\n\u201cWe have a review ongoing at the moment on the evidence around masks.

He said: \u201cWe are looking at the busiest parts of our road network to see where we can give people walking more space.\n\u201cTfL and City Hall will work with London boroughs who are looking to reduce traffic on residential streets as long as this does not hinder the emergency services or other essential journeys.\u201d\nIn Manchester, residents of the city\u2019s Northern Quarter have segregated at least one street using cones to allow bikes and pedestrians more space.\nChris Boardman, the Greater Manchester cycling and walking commissioner, said: \u201cCreating safe space for people to make essential journeys without a car or take exercise is essential if we are to be able to sustain isolation, so seeing streets cordoned off is really important. It\u2019s particularly heartening to see these measures being implemented by the people who live there, telling us this is how they want their street to be.\u201d\nSome councils, including Hackney in London, and Brighton & Hove, are also considering moves. Hackney councillors will vote on a list of potential \u201cfiltered\u201d streets \u2013 that would only allow access or emergency vehicles \u2013 as early as next week.\nBrighton\u2019s environment, transport and sustainability committee has commissioned feasibility studies on reallocating space from cars to pedestrians, although councillors warned it may not prove legally or practically possible.\nStephen Edwards, the policy director of Living Streets, a charity that promotes active travel, said Covid-19 had underlined the lack of space given to pedestrians compared with the car. He said: \u201cBanning cars from certain roads can help thin out overcrowded pavements and make our daily exercise easier and safer.\n\u201cWe also need lower speed limits to accommodate the fact that more people are being forced off the safety of the footpath and into the carriageway.\u201d\nTraffic dropped to its lowest level yet on Easter Sunday, according to the AA motoring organisation, with just 20% of the usual number of vehicles on the road. However, police and city authorities around the country have reported an increase in speeding among those continuing to drive.",

The reality is, it\u2019s going to be weeks still,\u201d the prime minister said on Tuesday. \u201cIt is going to be important to get our economy going \u2013 but we\u2019re going to have to remain vigilant until such a time as a vaccine is found.\u201d\nTrudeau\u2019s measured comments come in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the protracted slowdown of the American economy and has clashed with state governors over deciding when measures will ease.\nOn Monday, the US president told reporters that his administration was \u201cvery close to completing a plan to open our country. Hopefully, even ahead of schedule.\u201d\nThe Canadian economy has also ground a halt in recent weeks following advice from health officials to lock down much of the country, prompting the government to pass billions in temporary aid.

We\u2019re not through this first wave of Covid-19.\u201d\nHe also suggested that the border with the US would remain closed to all non-essential travel for weeks to come, calling it an \u201cextremely important\u201d measure of curbing the spread of the virus.\nAs of Tuesday, Canada had recorded more than 26,100 cases of the coronavirus and 823 deaths, many of which happened at long-term care facilities.\nTrudeau extended his condolences to families that have lost loved ones in retirement homes.\n\u201cWe recognize the tragic and terrible stories that have come out of long-term care homes.

        "content": "My friend Sir Brian Crowe, who has died aged 82, was a diplomat who, after a career at the Foreign Office, spent his last eight years as a civil servant at the European Union, where as director general for external affairs he tried to create a common foreign and security policy for the EU.\nThe job, which he took at the behest of the British government in 1994, was both \u201cfascinating, but also very frustrating\u201d, he later recalled. A pragmatic Europhile, he lacked the institutional backing in Brussels to forge an effective EU foreign policy. But his role, a creation of the Maastricht Treaty, also kept him engaged with issues he had encountered previously in Moscow, Washington, Bonn, Brussels, Vienna and London during 33 years with the Foreign Office.\nBrian was born in London into a diplomatic family. It was in Tokyo that his UK diplomat father, Eric, who died when Brian was 14, met and married his mother, Virginia (nee Teusler), an American descended from Robert E Lee, the confederate general, and the Native American princess Pocahontas.\nAfter Sherborne school in Dorset he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics. He joined the Foreign Office straight from university, and was posted to the Moscow embassy in 1962. He was there for two years and enjoyed his posting during the relative freedom of the Nikita Khrushchev era.\nHe returned to Britain in 1964 as a desk officer for Romania and Hungary until 1967, during which time he was also a resident clerk, covering at the Foreign Office on evenings and weekends in return for a free flat at the top of the department building. In 1967 he helped negotiate Britain\u2019s withdrawal from Aden, and in 1968 he was posted to the Washington embassy as a first secretary, dealing with the press.\nIn 1973 he went to Bonn as head of chancery, also working on issues related to the European Economic Community (EEC). Three years later he was promoted to head the FO policy planning staff in London, and in 1979 he was transferred to Brussels as head of chancery in what was effectively the UK embassy to the EEC. By 1982 he had returned to London as head of the FO\u2019s external EEC department, dealing with EEC trade relations in Africa and elsewhere.\nAfter a posting in 1985 back to Washington as minister (commercial) at the embassy there, in 1989 he was made UK ambassador to Austria, later in that role engaging in ill-fated efforts to bring about a peaceful break-up of Yugoslavia. His final FO posting, in 1992 was as deputy under secretary of state, with responsibilities that included trade policy. He then left the FO to take up his post with the EU, before retiring in 2002.\nOf powerful intellect, Brian could be brusque and perhaps because of this he never reached the pinnacle of his chosen profession. Instead he operated efficiently and effectively in many roles on both sides of the Atlantic and as an occasional troubleshooter.\nHe married Virginia Willis, a House of Commons researcher, in 1969; her charm and empathy complemented his more reserved character. Virginia died in 2019. He is survived by their two sons, Alex and Charlie, and by three sisters.",

This figure includes products bought from major liquor retailers but also small business owners such as cellar doors which have had to innovate and switch to online sales.\nAustralia Post said it had taken steps to protect its employees and customers, including introducing physical-distancing measures and moving to contactless delivery. Customers no longer have to sign for parcels.\nBut increased volumes and additional breaks for hand hygiene purposes have contributed to delays. Retailers have also had to take time to process a flood of orders from customers.\nA Target spokesperson said the retailer had seen a significant increase in demand for its online services over the last few weeks, which had \u201cimpacted stock availability on some of our more popular lines and has also meant home deliveries may take a little longer than usual\u201d.\nTarget reported rising demand for gym and fitness equipment, home office and stationary, homewares and comfort clothing.\nBig W, too, has reported a growing volume of online orders and has reduced its weekday trading hours to give its staff more time to fulfil these orders.\nWhile Australia Post\u2019s parcel volumes are booming, other parts of the business have experienced declines as the health response to the Covid-19 outbreak ushers in major changes to the country\u2019s economic and social life.\n\u201cAlthough our parcels to consumers are growing strong right now, our letters business, our international business and many of our other great services such as providing passports, have almost immediately shrunk,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cEven though we are seeing a large number of letters through our business, we have witnessed our letter volumes fall over 45%, as has our international revenues and some of the other key services like passports, have halved.\n\u201cAround 97% of our letter volumes come from businesses, and as they close their doors, they send less.\u201d\nAustralia Post announced on Tuesday that reductions in air freight capacity would result in delays in delivering letters and parcels.\nIt said delays would mean that priority mail services may be suspended. Delivery times for Perth and Brisbane may increase by up to five days; north Queensland by up to seven days, and Tasmania by three days.\nAustralia Post also warned that it may not be able to maintain next-day express post services into regional and rural communities. It said it was exploring all available transport alternatives and options while working with the federal government to minimise impacts for customers.\nThe health department has advised mail and cargo workers to follow similar hygiene procedures that apply across the community more generally, including washing their hands frequently with soap and water and staying more than 1.5 metres away from other people.\nIt says there is \u201cnot considered an increased risk to cargo and mail workers as on most dry surfaces, coronaviruses die within a few hours as secretions dry out\u201d.\nThe department also points to advice from the World Health Organisation that it is safe to receive international letters or packages.\nThe union representing postal workers has urged delivery drivers who haven\u2019t been provided with portable supply of hand sanitiser to avoid delivering an article to a home or business location if it would require touching any hard surface such as door handles, intercoms or lift buttons.",

        "content": "As Port Douglas, Cairns and Airlie Beach turn into ghost towns, businesses are wondering how to survive the dual spectres of a pandemic and global heating\nAbout this time of year, the weather in tropical north Queensland takes a turn towards glorious. Last Saturday in Cairns would have made a postcard, had any tourists been in town to experience the onset of the dry season.\nHotel occupancy rates in Cairns have fallen to single digits and most tourism businesses have closed their doors \u2013 some forever \u2013 as the region\u2019s lifeblood industry is brought to a standstill by coronavirus travel bans and other restrictions. The local tourism lobby estimates losses of about $2.5bn and 11,000 jobs this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s eerie around town, the weather is beautiful but no one is around,\u201d dive instructor and singer Tanya Murphy told Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve lost both my jobs and everyone I know in the tourism industry is in the same situation.\u201d\nAt Port Douglas, the smaller resort town to the north of Cairns, the experience of the shutdown is more acute; most of the cafes and restaurants up and down Macrossan Street have closed.\nAt Airlie Beach, the mainland hub for the Whitsunday islands, dozens of tour boats are now permanently moored at the harbour jetty. Many tour operators say they\u2019re still paying full price for berthing fees, premises rentals and insurance.\n\u201cShutdown is almost putting it too politely,\u201d says Tony Fontes, a semi-retired dive instructor from Airlie Beach.\n\u201cNo boats at all on the Great Barrier Reef coast are running out to the reef. Towns are shut down, restaurants are shut down, hotels are shut down \u2013 either because of the restrictions or because of a lack of people. Obviously with international air travel closed, there\u2019s just no people in town; even backpackers aren\u2019t there.\n\u201cYou can walk down the middle of Main Street without any risk of being hit by a car. I\u2019ve been here since \u201978 and of course it was a much smaller town, but I\u2019ve never seen it like this.\u201d\nThe Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told ABC News Breakfast on Tuesday that any moves to reopen the domestic tourism market would be \u201cnegligent\u201d.\n\u201cI know that tourism operators are struggling, Cairns is a tourism industry megacentre,\u201d Palaszczuk said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t open up tourism, it would be absolutely negligent to open up tourism when we are flattening the curve. We don\u2019t want to give any false sense of hope [to people] that suddenly there is going to be planes flying in the sky in the next two months and tourism is going to be back to normal because we are in a world pandemic.\u201d\nMost tourism operators and industry groups in north Queensland acknowledge that a restart is not a quick fix, and that the region\u2019s reliance on international tourists and the Great Barrier Reef means the recovery will likely be slower than other regions, with short, medium and longer-term challenges.\n\u201cWe will be one of the last destinations to recover and estimate that the region will lose at least $2.5bn in visitor expenditure which is 15% of our gross regional product in 2020,\u201d Tropical North Tourism\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Olsen, said.\n\u201cThe region received more than $200m worth of cancellations in March with the impact to the end of April estimated at $500m in lost visitor spend.\n\u201c[We were] the first region in Queensland significantly impacted as the Chinese stopped travelling over Chinese New Year \u2013 the peak travel time for our largest international market.\u201d\nTourism operators say international coverage of Australian bushfires, though nowhere near Cairns, also deterred some travellers.\nNikki Giumelli, who runs Cairns jet boat tour business Bad Fishy, said the situation became \u201cvery concerning\u201d about mid March.\n\u201cAt this point in time all our boats are tied up and unable to be used,\u201d Giumelli said. \u201cIt\u2019s very quiet down on the waterfront and it would usually be bustling.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a beautiful destination that\u2019s well positioned for a domestic recovery once the conditions are right for that to happen. But there are quite a few hurdles to get there. You would be negligent to think this is something that\u2019s going to be solved quickly. We may take longer than other regions to recover.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fed by the aviation sector, the tourism sector. There\u2019s an anxiety sitting there about when a trickle of reasonable business will return. There are many businesses that are very good at what they do, but it\u2019s really difficult and it\u2019s uncharted for many business owners to hibernate their business. There\u2019s a real concern that not everyone will survive this even if they hibernate.\u201d\nFor most international tourists who have come into Cairns and beyond, the Great Barrier Reef has always been the most significant drawcard. It consistently ranks as the top reason for foreign visitors.\nWhile the coronavirus situation poses an immediate and severe threat to the industry, some worry the recovery might also be hampered by the climate damage occurring to the reef, which has suffered its third mass bleaching in five years.\nMurphy, who is the coordinator of Divers for Reef Conservation, said economic stimulus to support the tourism industry to recover needed to be matched by commitments that supported the sector in the long term, including action on climate change.\n\u201cEveryone I know in the tourism industry, hundreds of people, are in the same situation as me at the moment. If we don\u2019t do everything we can to bring the reef back to its former state, then our economy is not going to be very well off even after things return to normal.\u201d\nFontes said he thought some tour operators who may be considering whether to re-establish their businesses after the coronavirus outbreak \u201cmay be discouraged by the health of the reef and think it\u2019s all too hard\u201d.\n\u201cI do talk to my dive mates up in Cairns, and they are talking of ghost towns in Port Douglas and Cairns as well,\u201d Fontes said.\n\u201cI wish we could take lessons from what the government is doing in fighting the pandemic ... they\u2019ve turned the economy on its head and shown what can be done when it\u2019s required.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s just unfortunate people don\u2019t look at climate change and the future impacts of that as they do about pandemic. It\u2019s just a slow-motion disaster that doesn\u2019t startle people into action. But it is possible to move mountains when you want to.\u201d",

While the prime minister was later criticised for joking that the plan might be called \u201coperation last gasp\u201d, British industry wasted no time in getting to work.\nThe\n Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is \nresponding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic. We want to learn more about \nrecent decisions taken at the heart of government. If you're a \nwhistleblower or source and with new information, you can email\u00a0investigations@theguardian.com\u00a0or\n (using a non-work phone) send us a Signal or WhatsApp to this number \n(UK) +44 7584 640566. (The number does not take calls.) For the most \nsecure communications,\u00a0use SecureDrop\u00a0and for general advice on confidentially contacting the Guardian\u00a0see our guide.\nThe NHS had about 8,175 ventilators at the time of Johnson\u2019s request and he called on firms to deliver 30,000 within weeks, a task some experts have said was unrealistic. Health secretary Matt Hancock has since revised that requirement down to 18,000.\nBut with the peak of coronavirus cases expected soon, the target has still not been met and time is running out. Meanwhile, the government has been criticised for failing to to take part in an EU scheme to procure the devices. One project called BlueSky, involving Formula One teams, was cancelled over the weekend after the government changed its specifications for the devices, raising concerns other projects could also be axed.\nSo far ventilator stocks have been increased to 10,120, around 1,000 commandeered from the private sector and the rest obtained through imports and orders from small suppliers.\nHere\u2019s how the rest of the ventilator effort is shaping up.\nWho are they?\nA consortium of nearly 30 firms, including Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, are helping scale up production of existing machines made by specialist firms Smiths Medical and Penlon.\nWhat are they making?\nConsortium members are lending their expertise, helping 3D print components and building new assembly lines to give Penlon and Smiths the muscle to increase production.\nHow many?\nThe government has provisionally ordered 5,000 Penlon machines and up to 10,000 of the Smiths paraPac device.\nAre they ready?\nThe paraPacs don\u2019t require regulatory approval and a small number have already been delivered to hospitals by the military. Penlon\u2019s is a slight variation on its original design. Some are undergoing clinical trials in hospitals, but they have yet to receive approval from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), so cannot yet be used to treat patients. The consortium says it will eventually be able to make 1,500 a week, but probably not until early May.\nWho are they?\nSir James Dyson\u2019s engineering company and Cambridge-based The Technology Partnership.\nWhat are they making?\nDyson was the first company to reveal that it had a provisional order from the government. Its brand new prototype, dubbed the CoVent, was developed with TTP in about a fortnight.\nHow many?\nA provisional order for 10,000.\nAre they ready?\nNo. The CoVent has yet to undergo MHRA trials and there is no sign that regulatory approval is imminent.\nWho are they?\nDefence company Babcock, working with German medical equipment specialist Draegerwerk.\nWhat are they making?\nThe Zephyr Plus, another new prototype, has support from a supply chain including weapons firm Raytheon, Plexus, Amtek-Precision and Astute Electronics.\nHow many?\nA provisional order for 10,000.\nAre they ready?\nNo. Like Dyson\u2019s CoVent, the Zephyr Plus requires regulatory approval.\nWho are they?\nScience Group\u2019s subsidiary Sagentia employs about 50 staff, a mixture of mechanical engineers, PHD physicists and experts in software and electronics.\nWhat are they making?\nThe Sagentia ventilator differs from some other models in that it uses laser-cutting and computer numerical control technology to manufacture components, meaning they don\u2019t need to be sourced from elsewhere.\nHow many?\nA provisional order for 10,000.\nAre they ready?\nNo. Like Dyson and Babcock\u2019s models, the machine is brand new and requires MHRA approval.\nWho are they?\nSwedish-owned Breas is a specialist medical device with a UK site in Stratford-upon-Avon.\nWhat are they making?\nBreas has been tight-lipped about its involvement but its website details an array of ventilator products under the Nippy brand name.\nHow many?\nUnknown\nAre they ready?\nBreas was already making ventilators so should not require MHRA approval. However the models listed on its website appear not to be designed for intubation, which is required in the most serious cases of Covid-19 requiring \u201cinvasive\u201d ventilation.\nWho are they?\nDiamedica is an anaesthesia and respiration specialist based in Devon. Plexus is a high-end manufacturing specialist with a base in Kelso, Scotland.\nWhat are they making?\nDiamedica already makes the Helix portable ventilator, which it claims is the leading device in emerging markets. It is working with Plexus to increase production.\nHow many?\nUnknown\nAre they ready?\nNeither Diamedica nor Plexus has said whether the Helix has MHRA approval.\nWho are they?\nFormula One racing teams Aston Martin, Red Bull and Renault were to help produce a design by junior doctor and inventor Dr Alastair Darwood.\nWhat are they making?\nProject BlueSky, previously called Remora, involved manufacturing designs by Darwood, a member of an NHS scheme for clinical entrepreneurs. The website for his company Darwood IP advertise a low-cost portable device called the Aura. The F1 teams worked 18-hour days to prepare their factories to scale-up production of the machine, if required.\nHow many?\nDarwood had an order for \u201cthousands\u201d.\nAre they ready?\nThe government has cancelled its provisional order. The machine was awaiting MHRA approval when the Department for Health and Social Care changed the specifications it required, rendering the machine unsuited.\nWho are they?\nThe UK has sourced 300 ventilators from China, the Germany military has donated 60 and Donald Trump promised 200 would be sent over from the US. Inspiration Healthcare, based in West Sussex, has a \u00a34m order for fewer than 500, coming from the US and Israel. Even BBC medical drama Holby City has lent a couple.\nWhat are they ?\nThe government has said very little about what type of ventilators are being imported but they are likely to be a variety of proven models.\nHow many?\n8000 orders, according to the Cabinet Office. More than 500 have arrived already and 1,500 are expected in the next few weeks.\nAre they ready?\nThe majority are yet to arrive.\nWho are they?\nThe European Union is using the combined purchasing power of its member states to buy new machines.\nWhat is this?\nThe UK was invited to join this scheme but did not. A spokesperson for No 10 initially said this was deliberate choice but the government later changed its mind, saying it had missed the invitation due to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d.\nHow many?\nUnknown\nAre they ready?\nNo. The EU procurement process is still ongoing and leaked documents have said that delivery could take anything from 10 weeks to a year.\nWho are they?\nThe Mercedes-Benz Formula One team is working with University College London.\nWhat are they making?\nThey are producing continuous positive airway pressure machines, which are designed to treat patients before they require full-blown invasive ventilation. Patients using a CPap receive oxygen through a mask, rather than having a tube inserted into their trachea to breathe on their behalf.\nHow many?\nThe government ordered 10,000\nAre they ready?\nCPaps are easier to build than heavy duty ventilators and hundreds are already being delivered to the NHS.",

Heathrow\u2019s busiest day for cargo so far was on 31 March, when it handled 38 cargo flights in only one day. The airport usually deals with 47 cargo flights per week.\nHowever, the absolute volume of cargo has dropped, by 32% in March, according to the latest figures. This is because more than 95% of cargo is usually transported in the hold of passenger planes.\nThe airport said passenger numbers had already tumbled by 52% to 3.1m in March, compared with a year earlier, after the UK government advised against all but essential travel. Meanwhile, the total number of flights landing and taking off at Heathrow \u2013 covering passenger planes and cargo \u2013 fell 35% to 25,798.\nThe airport warned that the decline in travel would have \u201clasting and significant\u201d effects on the industry, as it confirmed that the decline in April traffic would be even steeper than the previous month\u2019s.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nThe bulk of the passengers who travelled in March were flying back to their home countries owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. Last month the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, announced that the government would spend \u00a375m to rescue hundreds of thousands of British nationals stranded abroad as airlines suspended flights and grounded planes.\nHeathrow said the remaining passenger flights in April would also be part of repatriation efforts, for UK citizens returning home and for foreign citizens en route to their homes.\nDestinations and arrivals on the departure board on Tuesday included Manchester, Doha, New York and Frankfurt \u2013 operated by airlines such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and United Airlines.\nHeathrow said it was prioritising cargo flights transporting medical supplies, including ventilators, medicines and Covid-19 testing kits.\nSome airlines have had to reroute to the airport during the outbreak. The Glasgow-based Loganair flew to Heathrow for the first time in its 58-year history after the closure of London City airport and will continue to do so in order to maintain a \u201cvital connection\u201d between London and the Isle of Man. Heathrow is also Britain\u2019s only remaining air link with Belfast during the pandemic.\nHeathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: \u201cHeathrow continues to serve the nation by keeping vital supply lines open and helping people get home. Now is the time to agree a common international standard for healthcare screening in airports so that when this crisis recedes, people can travel with confidence and we can get the British economy moving again.\u201d",

        "content": "Doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients told to do simple PPE checks themselves\nDoctors and nurses are being put at risk of catching Covid-19 because hospitals are abandoning vital checks to ensure their personal protective equipment (PPE) fits properly.\nGrowing numbers of hospitals are running so short of FFP3 face masks they are no longer insisting staff have a \u201cfit-test\u201d before they start wearing a mask while treating infected patients.\nNHS trusts do not want to deplete their limited supplies of the disposable masks by using them up during what until now have been seen as routine and necessary checks to ensure the virus cannot get past the mask and into the wearer\u2019s nose or mouth.\nThe fit-test is a rigorous process which ensures health workers wear the right size mask, which does not leak. The masks are sprayed with a chemical mist to see if staff can taste it.\nHowever, trusts are instead telling staff to carry out what doctors fear is a crude and unreliable manual assessment, known as a \u201cfit-check\u201d, to see if masks have any gaps. This involves checking the seal by covering the filter, breathing in and seeing if the mask sucks in.\nThe Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK) says that hospitals which no longer do fit-tests are playing \u201cRussian roulette with doctors\u2019 lives\u201d at a time when Covid-19 has already claimed the lives of at least 40 NHS doctors, nurses, paramedics, midwives and porters.\nHospitals appear to be in breach of Health and Safety Executive guidelines, which specify that anyone using a disposable respirator such as an FFP3 in the course of their work should always have a fit-test first.\nFor example, Northwick Park hospital in London emailed its staff last week to tell them: \u201cAs you know, there is currently an international shortage of FFP3 masks. That means we can\u2019t rely on receiving the same types of mask that have been used in the fit testing process. Instead we are needing to change masks as supplies come into place.\n\u201cTherefore, we are adopting an approach that has already been put in place in a number of trusts both in London and nationally: we are training staff to properly identify and use the best fitting FFP3 mask presently available, and to check that they have a good seal.\n\u201cThis is designed to keep you as safe as possible, regardless of which masks we have in stock.\u201d\nHospitals are also ditching fit-tests because they have been unable to get hold of the chemicals involved.\nSamantha Batt-Rawden, DAUK\u2019s president and an intensive care specialist, said: \u201cThis is a scandal which shows a flagrant disregard for the safety of frontline NHS staff. Many doctors will \u2018fail\u2019 a fit-test on certain brands of mask, which means it will not work for them.\n\u201cWith mask brands and types regularly changing due to shortages, sometimes shift to shift, doctors are now going in blind, with no way of knowing whether a particular mask will give them any protection whatsover. It is simply unacceptable to play Russian roulette with doctors\u2019 lives.\n\u201cThis flagrant disregard for the safety of dedicated NHS staff must be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u201d\nOne hospital consultant said: \u201cI\u2019m worried. I tried to get fit-tested and my hospital isn\u2019t testing anyone now. I\u2019ve just been told to breathe deeply and see if there is a leak. How is this safe? They won\u2019t admit it but they are gambling with our lives because they don\u2019t have enough masks.\u201d\nProf Neil Mortensen, the president-elect of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \u201cRespiratory protective equipment needs to fit the wearer\u2019s face and must be tested before it is used to ensure it is effective. Surgeons who responded to our survey said they have been told to \u2018fit-test themselves\u2019, highlighted mask shortages, and mentioned shortages of the testing solution.\u201d\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England, said the NHS had a \u201cplentiful\u201d supply of FFP3 masks but that there were \u201cseveral challenges around fit-testing\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThe current emergency PPE distribution system, which proactively delivers PPE to trusts without them having to order it, means trusts are receiving up to five different brands of face mask. Each time a person starts using a different brand of mask, they need a new fit-test. This can take up to an hour for each member of staff.\n\u201cThere has also been a shortage of fit-testing solution, though we understand this is now easing. Trust leaders will always do everything they can to ensure every member of staff is appropriately fit-tested.\u201d\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cNational guidance is clear that fit-tests are required in hospitals. Government is continuing to procure vital protective equipment in line with its PPE strategy, and over the bank holiday weekend more than 48m pieces of protective kit were distributed to us, including 160,000 fit-test solutions and 8,000 fit-test kits.\u201d\n This article was amended on 15 April 2020. A reference to Derriford hospital having suspended mask fit-testing was removed after University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust informed the Guardian that testing had not been stopped.",

        "content": "Wisconsin Republicans lost a state supreme court race on Monday after pushing to hold an election amid the Covid-19 pandemic\nIn the end, it wasn\u2019t even close.\nLess than a week after forcing Wisconsin voters to risk their health and go to the polls, Wisconsin Republicans suffered a stunning defeat on Monday night.\nDaniel Kelly, a conservative justice on the state supreme court, lost his seat to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger, by more than 163,000 votes. Such a wide margin is remarkable in Wisconsin, where a race for a different state supreme court seat was decided last year by just 6,000 votes.\nThe election served as an early litmus test of Donald Trump\u2019s political strength in Wisconsin, a state he critically needs to win in November. And it was the most significant test so far of whether a state could hold a fair election in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans in the state refused a last-minute request to delay the election. That decision was widely seen as a cold political calculation \u2013 fewer people would turn out to vote in person, which would benefit Kelly.\nUltimately, that calculation was wrong. Turnout was just over 34%, the highest for a spring election in the state since 2016, when both parties had competitive presidential primaries. It was only the second time in over half a century that a challenger defeated an incumbent for a seat on the state supreme court, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Karofsky\u2019s victory means the conservative majority on the supreme court will narrow from 5-2 to 4-3.\nThe election offers a strong rebuff to Trump, who insisted that Democrats wanted to postpone the election and move to an entirely vote-by-mail contest to boost their political chances. Trump has also repeatedly, and falsely, claimed that mail-in balloting leads to widespread voter fraud \u2013 there is no evidence of that in Wisconsin or elsewhere \u2013 and that it only benefits Democrats.\nIt\u2019s more likely that Democratic turnout benefited from the party\u2019s presidential primary being on the ballot. And at a time when Americans are spending more time consuming news at home, the controversy over whether to hold the election may have actually wound up encouraging voters, said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\u201cIronically, isolation at home might have fostered higher voter turnout,\u201d he said.\nBut the election still came at a high price and probably disenfranchised many voters. People waited hours in line in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Waukesha to vote on election day, even as the state was under a formal stay-at-home order. State health officials are tracking whether holding in-person voting led to more cases of Covid-19.\n\u201cAlthough we were successful in this race, the circumstances under which this election was conducted were simply unacceptable, and raise serious concerns for the future of our democracy,\u201d Karofsky said in a statement on Monday evening. \u201cToo many were unable to have their voices heard because they didn\u2019t feel safe leaving their home or their absentee ballots weren\u2019t counted.\u201d\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Karofsky said she was still hearing from voters who were unable to vote because they never received an absentee ballot or did not feel comfortable going to the polls. Even though she won, she said she still believed the election should have been moved.\n\u201cTheir voices matter no matter what the result was yesterday,\u201d she said of disenfranchised voters. \u201cI do not think it can ever happen again. We can never have the type of voter suppression that we had last week, which resulted in people having to make an impossible choice between voting and staying healthy or alive.\u201d\nKarofsky added she thought last-minute Republican maneuvering around the election only reinforced the anti-corruption message her campaign pushed. \u201cWhen it happens that quickly, it\u2019s really easy for people to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.\nCharles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT who studies elections, said that voter turnout in Milwaukee county was between 35,000 and 50,000 votes short of what it \u201cshould\u201d have been compared with other counties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that turnout would have been greater in towns like Milwaukee and Green Bay had in-person election day voting not collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this race showed the value of the belt-and-suspenders approach of making mail voting available for everyone who wants it, but still maintaining as much of an in-person program as possible.\u201d\nThere is a nationwide push to prepare for a mail-in election in November, and the Wisconsin contest offered a case study of the challenges. State officials got an unprecedented 1.2 million people to request mail-in ballots through early and consistent public messaging. But the flood of requests overwhelmed local clerks, who were unable to issue ballots promptly. Reports of people who requested ballots but never received them were being investigated by the Wisconsin elections commission and US Postal Service.\nWisconsin\u2019s election highlighted the way last-minute court rulings and changes can bring havoc. Days before election, a federal judge extended the deadline to receive absentee ballots, but on the eve of the election, the US supreme court stepped in and added a requirement that ballots be postmarked by election day. That ruling caused enormous confusion after ballots started arriving at election offices without postmarks, disenfranchising voters who had put their ballots in the mail close to election day. It\u2019s still not clear how many viable ballots were thrown out.\nThe contest also illustrated how severely Covid-19 can curtail in-person voting. In Milwaukee, city election officials faced such a shortage of poll workers that they closed down all in-person voting and offered just five locations to vote on election day, compared with the usual 180. Turnout in the city dropped 20 points from 2016.\n\u201cIt is indisputable that thousands upon thousands of voters were disenfranchised,\u201d said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party. \u201cVoter suppression might not be as clever as Republicans think it is. It can backfire by pissing voters off.\u201d",

There were no nightly tributes to Prince titled Purple Reign. The $7 steak and egg deal in an all-night restaurant would not be available from midnight to 6am.\nIn front of Caesars Palace, the fountains were dry and still. A stone-faced Caesar gestured from a pedestal as a lone goose waddled down the street, alongside the few passing cars. Gondolas docked at the entrance to the Venetian on still water the color of toilet bowl cleaner.\nTop: The entrance to the closed Caesars Palace Casino in Las Vegas on 31 March 2020. Bottom: The Las Vegas Strip sits empty with all businesses shuttered.\nMost of the businesses on the Vegas Strip and on Fremont Street, the city\u2019s old strip, shut down in mid-March, when Steve Sisolak, the Nevada governor, ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses. (One holdout was Little Darlings, a strip club which defiantly stayed open, advertising \u201ccoronavirus-free\u201d dancers and nude hand sanitizer wrestling. They\u2019ve since closed. Their billboard read, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re clothed,\u201d featuring a photo of a woman in a short, frilly skirt and a cloth face mask, looking over her shoulder in apparent alarm.)\nThis is the first time the entire strip has been shut down since the JFK assassination; even the devastating mass shooting in 2017 only resulted in a partial closure.\nThe effects on the local and state economy are expected to be catastrophic. Las Vegas saw 42.5 million visitors in 2019, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority estimates that the city hosted 3 million visitors in February alone.\nThe economic indicators for the state as a whole, which relies just as heavily on tourism, are devastating: the Nevada Resort Association (NVA) has warned the state has lost an estimated $2bn from cancelled meetings and conventions, and could lead to $39bn in economic losses overall. The NVA says that one in three jobs in Nevada are connected to the tourism industry, responsible for $20bn in annual wages and salaries. \u201cNo other state in America depends on travel and tourism at the magnitude Nevada does,\u201d the Association warns.\nAnd so Las Vegas has become one of the most striking places in the United States to be able to see the toll the crisis has taken on fun and leisure.\nTop/middle: Closed casinos at the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas on 30 March 2020. Bottom: An empty Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas during the Covid-19 shutdown.\nOther tourist destinations that have shut down, such as Disneyland, are closed to visitors, but on the strip stragglers can float across the empty places like they\u2019re scrambling around in the ruins of an empty civilization. Before they closed, the casinos posted goodbye-for-now messages on the digital screens they usually use to welcome guests. They make for a haunting backdrop: \u201cStay safe, stay strong, we look forward to welcoming you back soon,\u201d from the MGM Grand, and \u201cDoors closed, hearts open\u201d at Palace Station. In a particularly grim twist, many establishments have been using the hashtag #VegasStronger in their signage, since #VegasStrong was already used, in the aftermath of the 2017 shooting. The giant resort hotels behind the casinos are walls of black, every hotel room dark.\nThe strip and Fremont Street aren\u2019t totally empty, of course. All the left-behind establishments are carefully watched by security guards, some of whom will try to stop photos being taken of a casino with caution tape strung across its entrance. Much of the street is also webbed in construction netting and the sounds of workers hammering during the day, the pause of the pandemic becoming a good time to give the sewer system a facelift. Overnight, police clustered at the intersections and the entrances to the higher end casinos. Unhoused people looked for places to rest and food to eat in empty trash cans.\nTop Left: A sign notifies drivers that the entrance to the Encore Casino is closed. Top Right: The entrance to Circus Circus Casino during the Covid-19 shutdown. Bottom: People sleep in a parking lot in Las Vegas on 30 March 2020.\nVegas, of course, is more than its tourist quarter. When the awful silence from the strip faded away, it was replaced with the hum of life in any major city right now: people riding bikes, walking dogs, cautiously getting groceries.\nSome marks of how coronavirus has altered the city, though, are more disturbing than empty casinos or shuttered daiquiri bars. A Catholic Charities-run night shelter temporarily had to close on 25 March, after an employee and a guest both tested positive for the virus (the shelter reopened on 1 April). For a week, people who would have spent the night in the shelter slept instead in a parking lot outside Cashman Field, directly on the concrete, in neatly taped-off rows. Behind them, in the distance, the strip shimmered, the walls of empty hotel rooms safely encased in glass.\nThe empty Las Vegas Strip on 30 March 2020.",

        "content": "Club with no full-time players have won promotion but will not be changing their ethos or their pay structure\nRichmond\u2019s return to the Championship is a parable for the most challenging period rugby has faced. A club that do not have contracts with their players and whose priority is the organisation and everyone involved in it rather than the first team stood alone the last time they were first promoted to English rugby\u2019s second tier three years ago. But their model is set to be copied by others as the financial impact of the coronavirus lockdown deepens.\n\u201cThe finances of the Championship simply don\u2019t work,\u201d says Steve Hill, Richmond\u2019s director of rugby for the past 10 years and first-team head coach. \u201cWith the cuts to it that will be made by the Rugby Football Union, more clubs will have to look at our model. Outside Ealing Trailfinders, who have a wealthy backer, virtually all are losing money and it cannot continue. You do not want clubs going out of existence but we are in danger of that happening as things stand.\u201d\nRichmond\u2019s two-season fling in the Premiership ended in 1999 when their backer pulled out and they dropped to the bottom of the league pyramid. They are trading places with Yorkshire Carnegie, who survived last season at the expense of the south-west London club after parachuting in players to help them to avoid relegation. Yorkshire controversially retained their status after agreeing a company voluntary agreement with creditors, having piled up debts of more than \u00a3500,000. This season Yorkshire have lost all 14 league games, are set to leave Headingley and are reverting back to being called Leeds.\n\u201cI suppose it made our promotion doubly sweet,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThe RFU told us Carnegie were going to be very competitive this season. We knew that would not be the case, but 12 months on we really enjoyed our season in National Division One, a cracking, incredibly competitive competition. We were not the favourites to win it, with some clubs paying a lot more than our match fees . The highest payers hit trouble and lost players, reinforcing my belief that rugby beneath the Premiership needs to be reset.\n\u201cMore teams will have to become part-time. There is no other way if rugby is to become financially sustainable. All sports will have to consider how and where money is spent. If rugby goes back to the days when clubs invested in facilities, coaching and creating a really good social atmosphere, that will attract players because they will not be able to do so by offering money. Some of the amounts being offered at level four and below are ridiculous: a lot of that will now have to disappear, which will be a good thing.\u201d\nLike all clubs, Richmond have had to make adjustments as income all but stops but they have not had to furlough players who hold full-time jobs in spheres ranging from teaching and recruitment to carpentry and sourcing film locations for production companies. \u201cWe pay a match fee and it is the same whether you have played 150 matches for the club or are making your debut,\u201d Hill says.\n\u201cThere are no contract negotiations and no one talks about money when they are having a meal after a game. They have proper conversations and I do not envy rugby directors who have to pick certain players because they are on big money. I can say to any new player that if they are good enough, they will be in the team; it is a powerful recruitment tool and I would struggle to explain to someone why another player was worth twice as much as him. \u201d\nNext season, Richmond will play Saracens for the first time in 21 years, the overspenders against the unsalaried. \u201cIt will be amazing,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt is the first question everyone asks me. There will be no pressure on us. When Bristol were last in the Championship, we were level 24-24 with them at half\u2011time at home. Pat Lam [the Bears\u2019 director of rugby] was going ballistic in the stand. They pulled away in the second half but we showed we can compete and in our three seasons in the Championship, Bristol and London Irish were the only clubs we did not beat.\n\u201cI do not know how many of Saracens\u2019 superstars will face us but anyone who plays for them is outstanding: their academy is second to none. It will be a fantastic occasion and we are looking forward to the away games at Cornish Pirates and Jersey, great weekends. We will stay over in Jersey and have a night out. We are not going to change as a club because we are in the Championship: ethos, environment and spirit are far more important than where your first team play.\u201d\nThe lockdown means Hill cannot do any recruitment. \u201cI like to meet someone face-to-face and see the whites of their eyes. What they are like as a person is more important than how good they are as a player. We don\u2019t need many because I have faith in the players who got us there.\u201d At least he does not have to deal with agents. \u201cThere is no need: 10% of not very much is even less.\u201d",

Most would mutter \u201coh shit\u201d and reconcile themselves to a night without sleep as they try to come up with some vaguely convincing answers to possible questions about the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Some might even have switched on the news and realised that deaths in care homes had become a hot topic.\nNot Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey. She just mumbles a simple \u201csure thing\u201d and settles down to a good night\u2019s sleep, certain she can wing her way through any interview. Seldom has confidence been so badly misplaced. Last week in her only previous outing, the secretary of state for work and pensions managed to underestimate the number of people claiming universal credit by 200,000. Now she was planning on going full Priti Patel in her desire never to be asked to make another public appearance.\nFirst up, she got completely rinsed by Dan Walker on BBC Breakfast. This was the equivalent of being taken apart by La-La of the Teletubbies. No disrespect to Dan, who comes across as a thoroughly likeable man, but he is most at home asking unthreatening lifestyle questions. Yet within minutes of the interview beginning, Coffey was behaving as if she had been waterboarded. \u201cI think we have been well prepared,\u201d she repeated desperately. Though admittedly her definition of being well prepared might be a little different to everyone else\u2019s.\nThings went rapidly downhill when she squared up to Piers Morgan, on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, and Nick Ferrari, on LBC radio. \u201cHow can you not know the answer to how many NHS staff or care home workers have died?\u201d Morgan asked. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answer to that,\u201d Coffey admitted. Which was odd, because many of that morning\u2019s newspaper front pages had precisely those figures.\nThen it was hard to find any questions to which she did have an answer. She didn\u2019t know how many care home residents had died and she didn\u2019t have a clue why it had been a bad idea to apply for an EU procurement scheme on 24 February but a good one just a few weeks later.\nIn normal times, this could have been a career-ending series of interviews for Coffey. But in the year of the coronavirus such stupidity and incompetence gets forgotten within hours. No doubt all will soon be forgiven and Coffey will be back on the airwaves within a week. And just as hopeless.\nStill, the government had been clearly rattled enough to send out its star performer for the daily 5pm Downing Street press briefing. Just weeks ago almost no one outside the Tory party \u2013 and precious few within it \u2013 had heard of Rishi Sunak, but he has now become one of the cabinet\u2019s few beacons of sanity and competence. You just have to suspend disbelief rather. It\u2019s disconcerting to have a chancellor who looks younger than most teenagers and is so small that he has to peer round the sides of the Downing Street lectern as he can\u2019t see over the top.\n\u201cWe must be honest with the British people,\u201d Sunak said with his best honest man-of-the-people face, as he addressed the latest Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. Though not quite so honest that he could actually bring himself to spell out that the OBR was predicting a possible 35% fall in GDP with two million unemployed for the next three months. Only that it was just one forecast that could easily be wrong and even if it wasn\u2019t then he wouldn\u2019t sit around and let it happen.\nSunak has already delivered five separate budgets inside two months and you could almost see him writing his sixth and seventh as he was speaking. Many chancellors don\u2019t get to deliver that many in their entire political career. Sunak is on course to easily break double figures by the end of the year.\nNow was not the time for ideology or orthodoxy, he added, rather pointing out the obvious. Those horses have long since bolted. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice between the economy and public health,\u201d he concluded. Here he was sticking his neck out. There are quite a few of his cabinet colleagues who might beg to differ if they start to see the end of the Brexit transition receding further into the distance.\nNot all the media shared Rishi\u2019s faith in his own abilities. He might be the best of a bad bunch but the gene pool of ministerial talent wasn\u2019t exactly overloaded. Sunak tried to insist the UK would bounce back and that the government was committed to levelling up opportunities for everyone, but it was hard to see many winners in the coronavirus pandemic other than the hedge fund managers who had bet on a stock market collapse.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Rishi insisted, before bitterly regretting his choice of words. David Cameron had said exactly that back in 2012 and in the intervening years the NHS and public services had been cut and the gap in inequality widened. The chronicle of more deaths foretold.\nNor was there much faith in the way the UK reported its statistics, as it was now clear our mortality rate would be higher than France\u2019s if we included deaths in care homes and the community.\nLuckily, Sunak could palm this off to the two medical officers who insisted this was a blip and that they personally longed for the day when the charts had the UK outperforming Italy and Spain. The most telling question, though, was what they might have done differently in hindsight. On that they were all agreed. They would never have signed up to a daily press briefing. This one will run and run. As they all did for the exit.",

        "content": "Government figures only tell part of the story as they only cover hospital deaths\nThe UK death toll has risen past 12,000 deaths yet we know that this figure is not the complete picture as it excludes deaths occurring in other settings, including care homes.\nOne care home told the Guardian a third of its residents had died, but deaths in care settings may not be captured in official figures for weeks after they occur. What does this mean for the UK\u2019s true fatality count?\nAccording to government figures, there were 12,107 deaths in the UK to 5pm on 13 April. The problem is that this figure only tells part of the story as it just covers hospital deaths that had been verified as of that date. What we do not know is how many more deaths there have been in the community and, most pressingly, in care homes.\nTo give an indication of just how far out the daily figures are, as of 3 April the Department of Health and Social Care reported 4,093 coronavirus deaths in England and Wales. But the true figure \u2013 as revealed in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 latest release \u2013 was at least 52% higher than was known at the time.\nMany of these deaths will have been reported in the days after 3 April, but others, including care home deaths, are counted separately and never make it into the daily government announcements. Put simply, the big death toll you hear every day is an undercount.\nThe truth is we have no way of knowing for certain. The Guardian has revealed hundreds of deaths have occurred in care homes to date: two of the UK\u2019s largest care home providers have reported 521 coronavirus deaths between them so far.\nThe only official figures for care home deaths are those published by the ONS. These come out weekly, but there is a time lag because there is a delay between a death occurring and it being registered.\nThe latest ONS figures provide a breakdown of the locations where 4,122 registered Covid-19 deaths took place. They show that 217 or 5% of deaths that occurred in England and Wales registered by 3 April actually happened in care homes. A further 136 deaths occurred in private homes, while 33 were in hospices.\nIn its briefing note the ONS said, when all comparable data was taken into account, the number of deaths in England was about 15% higher than the NHS figures.\nHowever, the difference may well turn out to be higher as more deaths are registered. A recent report indicates that about half of all Covid-19 deaths could be happening in these settings in some European countries.\nWe cannot directly compare care home deaths in the UK with those in other countries as there are different ways of recording these deaths.\nIn Ireland, France and Germany, official data on deaths includes those in care settings. Of Irish deaths up until 11 April, 54% had occurred in care homes, according to the country\u2019s chief medical officer. Figures released by the French public health authority show 45% of deaths took place in care homes.\nRemoving care home fatalities from the French statistics reveals that the UK hospital death toll is higher than France\u2019s \u2013 which government briefings have failed to note when stating that Britain is behind France in official cumulative death figures.\nItaly and Spain, by contrast, do not report deaths in care settings regularly. In Italy, best estimates were based on a survey of 10% of care homes in the country. The death rate in this sample was extrapolated to reach an estimate for all care homes, which suggests 53% of coronavirus deaths were happening in care. In Spain, estimates based on regional totals submitted to the government also suggest those in nursing homes accounted for more than half of deaths.\nThe ONS figures are expected to be the gold standard as they will include deaths in both hospital settings and in the community. However, as the ONS bases its figures on death certificates, there are delays in its figures, meaning we may not see the true scale of the deaths for a number of weeks.\nSarah Caul, head of mortality at the ONS, said in a blogpost explaining the methodology: \u201cNumbers produced by ONS are much slower to prepare, because they have to be certified by a doctor, registered and processed. But once ready, they are the most accurate and complete information.\u201d\nHowever, concerns have been raised regarding the death registrations on which the ONS figures are based. A whistleblower told Channel 4 News death certificates may be undercounting the true number of deaths, because coronavirus is not always correctly listed as a suspected cause.",

It is a question that racing\u2019s planners, executives and fans seem sure to be asking themselves over the next few weeks as the sport plots what seems sure to be a very slow return to some kind of normality when the lockdown starts to ease. What, if anything, can be done to save British Flat racing\u2019s most famous Classic?\nThere has been a Derby winner every year since Diomed\u2019s success in the first running of the race in 1780. The first four Derbys were staged over a mile but it switched to 12 furlongs from 1784 and all but 10 of the 240 horses to win the Derby since 1780 did so at Epsom in either late May or early June.\nThe 10 Derbys staged at Newmarket during the two world wars \u2013 from 1915 to 1918 and then from 1940 to 1945 \u2013 were also run on or near the usual date in early June.\nThe decision has already been taken to postpone the Derby from its traditional slot on the first Saturday in June and there is a general feeling at Jockey Club Racecourses that it would be impossible to stage a Derby at Epsom behind closed doors.\nThis means that unless the restrictions on mass gatherings are relaxed much more swiftly than anyone expects, the 241st Derby will, for the first time in its long history, be staged at neither its traditional venue or at its traditional spot in the season.\nSo will it be a Derby at all? Marcus Tregoning, who saddled Sir Percy to win the Classic in 2006, thinks not. Tregoning said on Tuesday that to his mind the timing and location are essential aspects of our most famous Classic.\n\u201cThe Derby is run at a certain time of year, on particular course and that is part of the test,\u201d Tregoning said. \u201cIf you move it until later in the year or run it at a different course, it is obviously not the same race. The Derby is unique. You could run a Group One over the distance somewhere else and call it something else but it would not be the Derby.\u201d\nIn a purely racing sense Tregoning may well be right. You can conceivably lose either the time or the place but not both and in the case of the Derby the place is of paramount importance.\nFederico Tesio\u2019s famous quote about the existence of the thoroughbred breed being dependent on the \u201cpiece of wood\u201d that marks the finishing line at Epsom sums up the extraordinary test the famous course poses for an inexperienced three-year-old. Even now, if Derby winners like Dante (1945) and Owen Tudor (1941) ever get a mention, it tends to be followed by a reminder it was a \u201cwartime substitute race at Newmarket\u201d as if they are not absolutely 100% worthy of the status.\nBut the Derby \u2013 and having a Derby winner - is hugely important to the breeding industry, too. It is not always won by the best horse in the race and the winner does not always turn out to be an outstanding stallion. At the same time, though, it is essential to have a race that brings the most promising three-year-old colts together in the hope one will emerge as the clear leaders of his generation.\nThe Derby winner is a vital waypoint in the centuries-old process of trying to breed great racehorses, both when he competes against older horses later in the season and then, ideally, as a four-year-old the following season. Wartime Derby winners, the products of a much-reduced breeding industry, have varied in quality but included Gainsborough, a Triple Crown winner in 1918 and then the sire of Hyperion, the 1933 Derby winner and six-times champion sire, and Solario, the 1925 Leger winner, who was also subsequently a leading sire.\nEven if the Derby is rescheduled behind closed doors at Newmarket later in the year it seems unlikely there will be many trials in the run-up. Getting a representative field could depend on close co-operation between the organisers, handicappers and the biggest Flat racing operations. But if there is any way to do it, it should be done, and the 241-year sequence of Derby winners should be maintained. None of us, after all, will be worrying too much about the technicalities in another 200 years\u2019 time.",

Two properties and a car linked to the suspect were searched. He was released on conditional bail.\nIn a separate investigation, a 39-year-old surveyor from Uxbridge, west London, was stopped while driving his car, in which 250 Covid-19 testing kits were found. He was arrested under the Fraud Act 2006 after making false and misleading claims about the capability of the tests, which he told investigators he was planning to sell to construction workers. He was released on conditional bail.\nIn another unrelated move, the NCA took down a website trying to fool victims into buying suspected non-existent personal protective equipment (PPE) through phishing emails.\nNikki Holland, NCA director of investigations, said: \u201cIllegally selling testing kits completely undermines the nation\u2019s collective response to the pandemic and actually endangers lives.\n\u201cAnyone thinking of trying to profit in this way should take note of these arrests and that bringing these offenders to justice and ceasing their activities is a key priority across law enforcement.\u201d\nGraeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, added: \u201cCovid-19 is increasingly being used as a hook to commit fraud \u2013 and we think these offences are likely to increase during the pandemic.\u201d\nOffenders are targeting people trying to buy medical supplies online and have been sending emails offering fake medical support and scamming people who may be vulnerable or isolated at home, the NCA said.\nFrauds have been attempted by trying to lure victims with offers that look too good to be true such as high return investments, \u201chealthcare opportunities\u201d or appeals to support bogus charities.\nTariq Sarwar, head of operations for enforcement at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said: \u201cThe use of products for the diagnosis of coronavirus infection in community settings, such as pharmacies, for home use, is not at present advised by Public Health England.\n\u201cThere are no CE-marked tests for home use, and it is illegal to supply such products. The safety, performance or quality of the products cannot be guaranteed and this poses a health risk.\u201d He added: \u201cAlways make sure you are buying your medicines from a registered pharmacy or website and your medical devices from reputable retailers.\u201d",

The US is the single largest contributor to the WHO.\nRichard Horton, the editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, wrote that Trump\u2019s decision was \u201ca crime against humanity \u2026 Every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.\u201d\nAntonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said it was \u201cnot the time\u201d to cut funding or to question errors. \u201cOnce we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis,\u201d said Guterres.\n\u201cThe lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future. But now is not that time \u2026 It is also not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus.\u201d\nEchoing Guterres\u2019s plea, Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said the WHO did make mistakes and may need reform but that work needed to take place after the crisis had passed. \u201cIt\u2019s not the middle of a pandemic that you do this type of thing,\u201d he said.\nDr Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease doctor and associate professor at Boston University\u2019s school of medicine, said the cut was \u201can absolute disaster. WHO is a global technical partner, the platform through which sovereign countries share data/technology, our eyes on the global scope of this pandemic.\u201d\nLaurie Garrett, a former senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the decision was a \u201cdamnable\u201d act by a \u201cspiteful\u201d Trump and would cost lives. \u201cMeanwhile, WHO is the only lifeline most African, Latin American and Asia Pacific nations have.\u201d\nLawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO centre on public health and human rights, predicted the US would ultimately lose out because other countries would step into the vacuum with increased funding. \u201cIn global health and amidst a pandemic, America will lose its voice,\u201d said Gostin.\nThe WHO has come under fire over some aspects of its handling of the pandemic, and has been accused of being too deferential to China, considering the Communist party\u2019s early suppression of information and punishment of whistleblowers. Much of the focus of the criticism has been on a 14 January tweet from the WHO that said \u201cpreliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d. But WHO officials also told their counterparts in technical briefings on 10 and 11 January, and briefed the press on 14 January, that human-to-human transmission was a strong possibility given the experience of past coronavirus epidemics and urged suitable precautions.\nThe WHO has also been attacked over its continuing exclusion of Taiwan from membership because Beijing considers it to be Chinese territory. Trump\u2019s decision to cut funding was welcomed in some quarters, including by the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who called the WHO an \u201carm of Chinese diplomacy\u201d.\nThe WHO is an arm of Chinese diplomacy under the guise of liberal internationalism or global governance. Transnational cooperation is of course crucial to combating pandemics, but the institution in question is the anthesis of it, as the shunning of Taiwan makes painfully clear. https://t.co/00MYt2lBfo\nTrump\u2019s pronouncement came amid sustained criticism of his failure to prepare for the epidemic, which has infected more than 600,000 people and killed more than 24,000 inside his country. The US is the worst affected country in the world in terms of infection numbers. On Wednesday it was reported that $1,200 relief cheques for as many as 70 million people could be delayed for several days because Trump wanted his name printed on them.\nIn other developments:\nSouth African police fired rubber bullets and teargas at Cape Town township residents protesting over access to food aid during lockdown.\nMainland China reported a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday (46 down from 89), although an increasing number of local transmissions in its far north-east bordering Russia remained a concern.\nIn Italy, one of the worst-affected countries, dozens of doctors and nurses have died from Covid-19 and thousands of healthcare workers have become infected.\nAustralia jailed its first person for breaching isolation laws. The 35-year-old man will spend one month in jail after he repeatedly snuck out of a quarantine hotel to visit his girlfriend.\nNew Zealand\u2019s prime minister said she and other ministers would take a 20% pay cut to show \u201cleadership and solidarity\u201d with those affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for global growth and warned of a slump in output not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nGlobal cases moved towards two million.",

The restrictions on movement dramatically changed life overnight for millions of people in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nAt the time there were 967 new cases and the reported daily death toll was 87. The daily death toll on Tuesday was 778.\nNumber of new cases per day\nThis is a key factor in determining whether the lockdown is working. The number of positive cases has actually increased since it was put in place, however more people are being tested. Unfettered movement, particularly in densely populated areas where there is infection among the population, will lead to a rise in cases and deaths.\nNumber of hospital admissions\nMore than 20,000 people are currently in hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. The largest number of admissions is in London, with 4,433 patients, followed by the Midlands, with 3,092 admissions.\nThe number of intensive care beds has increased with the addition of Nightingale hospitals in London and Birmingham and new capacity being added elsewhere in the UK. Admissions and ICU bed capacity will also be central in making any assessments on the possibility of easing restrictions on movement, as limited access to critical care beds will have a knock-on effect on how may people die from the virus.\nNumber of deaths per day\nIn the UK, the daily death toll has risen from 87 when lockdown began to 778 on Tuesday. However due to delays in reporting, it is impossible to accurately assess the number of deaths, and those in care homes and the community are not included in the government\u2019s daily count. We are likely to be experiencing more deaths than reported and we will not know when we have reached and passed the peak for a number of days.\nOther issues likely to be taken into account include the impact of the restrictions on the economy, as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts the lockdown could lead to the loss of 2 million jobs and shrink gross domestic product by 35%; the knock-on effect on people\u2019s wellbeing including additional deaths, the effect on people\u2019s mental health and increased reports of domestic abuse.\n This article was amended on 15 April 2020. An earlier version said more than 20,000 people with Covid-19 symptoms had been admitted to hospital \u201cto date\u201d; this has been changed to make clear that this was the number in hospital at the time of publication.",

Five years on, Amazon Prime has put wind beneath its wings as part of its bid to muscle in on the standup special market. Much improved since its fringe appearance, Savage may still be too self-conscious and self-serious for some comedy fans. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough room in civilised society for sadness anymore,\u201d argues Fraser, whose show is certainly bigger on poignancy than good cheer. The filmed version cuts to audience members who are in tears.\nThe show\u2019s ostensible subject is the death of Fraser\u2019s mother, a musician with multiple sclerosis, after decades\u2019 of illness. There are audio clips of Fraser interviewing her mum. But although she warns us at the beginning to expect tragedy, she doesn\u2019t fully address it until the final third. For the most part, her show circles around ideas of faith, carpe diem, and how \u201conly the unfinished can contain the infinite, right?\u201d There are more tenuous ruminations where that comes from, as Fraser tells us how \u201cart is a great way to turn pain into beauty\u201d, and marvels at the innocent pleasures of infancy. \u201cHow good was it to be a baby? ... Do you remember how amazing it was?\u201d\nIt can all start to resemble the Ted Talk Fraser once delivered, as recounted in one set-piece here. The show withholds catharsis and ends in solemnity. Humour feels like a means of shepherding us towards the life lessons, rather than Fraser\u2019s instinctive response to the world. But it does that job well: Savage is nothing if not artfully constructed. And there are adroit comic manoeuvres, as she navigates from happy funerals to anal bleaching, advances her no-nonsense take on female body image issues or depicts her horror at having to follow an inspirational burns victim on to the Ted stage. With that routine, as often elsewhere, the audience\u2019s laughter sounds very much like relief that Fraser has broken one more portentous silence with a smile.",

        "content": "Unrepairable phones and laptops are one of the scandals of our throwaway society. But the pushback is building \u2013 and the coronavirus crisis has added more pressure for change \n\u2018Imagine you showed someone a smartphone 20 years ago. You said: \u2018Here\u2019s this thing, it\u2019s going to be awesome, and it\u2019ll cost $1,000. But the manufacturers are going to glue the battery in, and you\u2019re supposed to get rid of it when the battery wears out.\u2019 You would have thought that notion was completely bananas.\u201d\nNathan Proctor is talking via Google Hangouts from Boston, Massachusetts, about an allegedly central feature of modern manufacturing known as planned obsolescence. This is the idea that some of the world\u2019s biggest companies have been selling us products either knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years, or having deliberately built a short lifespan into the itemor its software.\nIt is a charge the companies would reject, but we all have everyday knowledge of what he is talking about \u2013 the suddenly dead or \u201cbricked\u201d \u2013 made as useless as a brick \u2013 phone, discarded printer or broken laptop. Most of us dismiss the phenomenon as an irritating but unavoidable feature of modern life. But Proctor is the director of the Right to Repair campaign spawned by the US\u2019s Public Interest Research Group (founded in 1971 by the celebrated activist Ralph Nader), and he wants us to see things very differently.\nAs we throw away machines and devices damned as out of date, the result is a growing mountain of e-waste. Last year alone, it was reckoned that more than 50m tonnes of it were generated globally, with only around 20% of it officially recycled. Half of the 50m tonnes represented large household appliances, and heating and cooling equipment. The remainder was TVs, computers, smartphones and tablets.\nNow, finally, across the world, tentative moves are being made to end this culture of obsolescence. In the US, Apple has recently agreed to pay up to $500m in settlements related to allegations that software updates caused older iPhones \u2013 such as the iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7 and 7 Plus \u2013 to slow down (the company denied any wrongdoing, and insisted the technique prevented older devices from shutting down altogether). In France, the same issue resulted in a fine of \u20ac25m (\u00a321m).\nIn Norway, the supreme court is deciding on the battle between Apple and Henrik Huseby, the owner of a small phone-repair shop, and the company\u2019s pursuit of claims about \u201ccounterfeit\u201d replacement screens that he insists were taken from old Apple devices. Meanwhile, the European commission has recently announced plans aimed at ensuring that a range of products will be \u201crecyclable, repairable and designed to last longer\u201d as part of a plan to halve waste across the EU by 2030.\nDifferent consumer choices might also be part of the answer, and Proctor\u2019s life as a tech consumer offers examples. The computer he is using to talk to me, he explains, is a Frankenstein PC \u2013 custom-built from parts of different computers, some of which were bought in the early 1990s. His iPhone dates from 2013. But he emphasises that what we choose to buy is much less important than the actions of governments and companies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix this problem person by person, changing how we treat smartphones. The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break.\u201d A few computer companies do better (\u201cHP and Dell provide access to firmware, spare parts and tutorials \u2013 they\u2019re really good, as far as we can tell\u201d), but their actions heighten his exasperation that many tech corporations are reluctant to follow suit.\nMeanwhile, the coronavirus crisis has brought our need for greater resilience and sustainability into sharp focus. Proctor noticed this from the start. \u201cA lot of new equipment \u2013 whether it\u2019s your electric fan or iPhone or networking equipment for your school or office \u2013 comes from China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because Chinese manufacturing was affected first, a lot of wholesalers saw a pretty significant increase in the demand for used equipment \u2013 whether that was laptops that schools were trying to redistribute so that kids could do homework, or hardware so that people could handle more remote operations.\u201d\nBut wholesalers and refurbishers found much of the equipment was locked against reuse because of manufacturers\u2019 systems. \u201cYou can buy the hardware, but you don\u2019t have the permissions to use it without getting some kind of new service agreement. So that\u2019s another problem.\u201d\nThe idea of planned or built-in obsolescence is certainly not new \u2013 it was first written about in 1928 by the American marketing pioneer Justus George Frederick. In the words of one subsequent account: \u201cHe stated that it was necessary to induce people to buy an ever-increasing variety of things, not in order to use them but to activate commerce and discard them after a short period of time.\u201d The concept even has its own film \u2013 in The Man in the White Suit (made in 1951, and recently screened as part of a BBC Two Ealing comedies series sparked by the lockdown), a chemist falls foul of textile producers and trade unions for creating a material that never needs replacing.\nNearly a century on from Frederick\u2019s description, it seems his idea is everywhere, and it sometimes feels as if we are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. The average time an individual keeps a smartphone is reckoned to be between two and three years. Astonishingly, according to EU research, the average lifetime of desktop printers is a mere five hours and four minutes of actual printing time. Ever-changing software spells the demise of fully functioning devices \u2013 which is why so many of us have household drawers filled with old ones, left behind \u2013 and often bricked \u2013 by the same companies that made them.\nSymbols of the extent to which companies make user repairs of their devices either impossible or extremely difficult are everywhere. iPhones are partly held together by Pentalobe screws, which are immune to standard screwdrivers. Some Amazon Kindles are constructed using glued plastic casing that is all but impossible to prise open. The reluctance of big companies to release information about the workings of their products is a constant source of frustration.\nAll this is being closely watched by a Brussels-based organisation called the European Environmental Bureau. One of the groups\u2019s key staff members, 28-year-old Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, tells me the EU\u2019s plans for digital devices promise to extend the rules that apply to such household objects as fridges and washing machines to laptops, tablets and smartphones. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about really serious requirements, which include things about spare parts and product information,\u201d he says. Yet this prospect is still five or six years away, while Brexit means that even such belated moves may not apply in the UK, and our own mound of discarded electronic stuff could just carry on growing.\nSchweitzer has a few betes noires. \u201cOne is wireless headphones,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople single out the Apple ones, but a lot of the other manufacturers are just as bad. The problem with lots of them is that you can\u2019t replace the batteries. As soon as they run out, that\u2019s it. Anything where you have an issue with the battery is really problematic, because they are all lithium-ion. Those are really rare, valuable resources. But because head-headphones are so small, people just throw them in their waste bins.\n\u201cIncreasingly, I\u2019m hearing a lot of complaints about products from Amazon. All of their stuff: Kindles, the hardware connected with Amazon Prime \u2013 apparently it has a very short lifespan. We\u2019re just getting to see that now.\u201d\nWhen I contact Apple, I get an email about its use of recycled materials: \u201cApple is using recycled cobalt from iPhone batteries recovered by its disassembly robot Daisy combined with scrap from final assembly sites for brand-new Apple batteries.\u201d\nIt sounds impressive, yet Proctor points out that recycling is only a small part of any solution: \u201cRecycling is an incredibly destructive process that doesn\u2019t really get that much raw material back. Say your phone is kinda old and buggy. A refurbisher could switch the battery out, maybe reinstall the operating system and get another two years. If you scrap that phone for its commodity value \u2013 the plastic, glass, aluminium and copper \u2013 you\u2019re probably not recycling more than 20% of it.\u201d\nI then get a second email, which points to an announcement from last year, about \u201ca new repair programme, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.\n\u201cApple will provide more independent repair businesses \u2013 large or small \u2013 with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers.\u201d This sounds like a modest victory for Right to Repair campaigners, but the announcement also contains a warning about using counterfeit parts.\nWhen I contact Amazon, a spokesperson says it is committed to sustainability. \u201cWe have built a refurbishment and trade-in programme that kept millions of devices from ending up in landfills in 2019 alone. We also design our products to last so that customers do not have to upgrade to new hardware every year \u2013 in fact, many of our products are still in use after five years.\u201d\nWith a hint that Amazon, too, is at least starting to hear the noise made by Right to Repair campaigners, it goes on: \u201cWe know we have more work to do to allow our customers to make informed choices and to provide transparent information about the environmental impacts of devices through their whole life cycle.\u201d\nMartine Postma is a former journalist, and founder of the international network of Repair Caf\u00e9s that began in 2009 in her native Amsterdam. Volunteers meet people who arrive with items that needs fixing, and in the process learn about bringing products back to life. The network now extends to 36 countries.\nBut when Postma runs me through the 10 most common items that people bring to Repair Caf\u00e9s, the difficulty of fixing digital devices is underlined. At the top are coffee machines. No 2 is trousers. Computers and laptops come in at No 8, and smartphones are absent. \u201cOur repairers tend to be older people, who haven\u2019t been brought up with [advanced] electronics. But we have seen growing interest in people becoming skilled in those areas.\u201d Despite this, she says, people often have an epiphany when they watch their first repair. \u201cThey often don\u2019t even expect that their repair will be possible. But something happens when you open a machine and see what\u2019s inside. You see that there is a way that things work. We\u2019ve seen that many, many times.\u201d\nIn Levenshulme, south Manchester, 33-year-old Jack Laycock is one of the key organisers of his local Repair Caf\u00e9 which, until the Covid-19 outbreak, met once a month, with five or six repairers, and at least 20 customers. When I ask him why he does it, the answer comes back in a flash. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much waste,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much stuff we throw away. The Earth can\u2019t sustain it. That was my reason for getting involved. But also, where I live is quite a diverse area: there\u2019s a lot of people who just can\u2019t afford to buy new stuff all the time.\u201d\nWhen I mention technology, the conversation takes a forlorn turn. Computers, he says, often prove impossible to fix. And smartphones? \u201cWe don\u2019t even take phones. They\u2019re so fiddly and small: if the screen\u2019s cracked, it\u2019s possible to repair it, but we don\u2019t have the tools.\u201d\nIn search of hope, I speak to Olivia Webb, the outreach co-ordinator at iFixit. The Wiki-based website is the online home for a global community and offers a world of advice about how to fix tech devices, plus a shop selling repair tools. It is starting to build up a stock of information about the maintenance and repair of hospital equipment, including ventilators.\niFixit has two HQs, one in Stuttgart, the other in San Luis Obispo, California, where about 150 people work. Its origin dates back to the early 2000s, when one of its founders broke his MacBook and, on finding no helpful information online, created his own repair guide. Now the site has an estimated 10 million visitors a month \u2013 thanks to the refusal of large swathes of the tech industry to help people to do their own repairs.\niFixit is a private company, but Webb also works on advocacy for the Right to Repair, which is now focused on lobbying the US government. \u201cWe were doing really well this year until the coronavirus happened,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had got legislation introduced in 21 states. We were making progress, but when the virus happened, it threw everything into question. But we\u2019re in a really good position, I think.\u201d\nWhat, ultimately, is it all about? \u201cOur goal is to take back ownership of what we have. That means being able to open it, tinker with it, change things inside it or whatever, without getting into trouble with the manufacturer.\n\u201cThere are thousands of tonnes of e-waste we throw away every year that are just marinating. That really has to change.\u201d",

        "content": "The story of a gay conscript in the army in the 80s gave one critic a panic attack \u2013 but its director says it sheds light on the nation\u2019s toxic masculinity\nFrom an outside perspective, South African cinema tends to announce itself through occasional breakout films rather than consistently visible directorial careers. Back in the 1980s, The Gods Must Be Crazy was a global hit that didn\u2019t do much to raise the profile of its director, Jamie Uys. Fourteen years ago, gritty township fable Tsotsi won the country one of its first Oscars, only to send director Gavin Hood directly into a proficient but culturally anonymous Hollywood career.\nIn Oliver Hermanus, however, the country has produced its most significant auteur in several generations. The 36-year-old Capetonian studied at the London Film School, but returned home for his art. His 2009 graduation film Shirley Adams, a tough-minded mother-son portrait set on the Cape Flats, set the tone for a career marked by global critical acclaim. He stepped up to Cannes with his follow-up, Beauty, a startling study of a closeted Afrikaner that made it to UK cinemas; his third film, The Endless River, did not.\nMoffie, Hermanus\u2019s poetic yet visceral fourth feature, feels like the one that will cement him in the contemporary arthouse canon. A war film that returns to the anxious queer terrain of Beauty, it has been collecting awards and plaudits \u2013 including three British Independent Film Award nominations \u2013 since premiering at Venice last autumn. It\u2019s his most pristinely accomplished film yet, though, in its conception at least, not his most personal: it adapts Andr\u00e9 Carl van der Merwe\u2019s semi-autobiographical 2006 novel, based on his experiences as a gay teenage conscript sent to fight in the South African Border War in the early 1980s.\nA gay director born after the events depicted in the film, Hermanus was intrigued by the possibilities of exploring a regimented realm denied to men of colour in the apartheid era, while finding common ground in his closeted white protagonist\u2019s suffering under a vicious Afrikaner patriarchy. \u201cThe subject matter did bother me at first,\u201d he says from his home outside Cape Town, where he\u2019s self-isolating under coronavirus lockdown. \u201cIt was my mum who actually said to me, \u2018Why make another film about white men in apartheid South Africa?\u2019\n\u201cBut the challenge is to find the centre of it that resonates with you completely. And for me, that became not just about the character\u2019s sexuality, but about the shame factor: the fact that under this regime, boys were sort of shamed into becoming a certain kind of man. Because we keep asking the question, especially in South Africa: where does our toxic masculinity come from? When I looked at it that way, when I sort of saw this as an exploration of our past that informs our present, I was more comfortable with it.\u201d\nVan der Merwe\u2019s novel had a more defined romantic throughline; though Hermanus\u2019s film outlines an attraction between protagonist Nicholas (Kai Luke Brummer) and a fellow misfit recruit, he deliberately downplayed the love story. \u201cA key rule of mine from the very beginning was that there was going to be no kind of conventional love scene: it wasn\u2019t going to be a relationship drama,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was going to be more about our connection to this problematic era, and the generation of men who lived through that.\u201d\nIn doing so, Hermanus was prepared to be confrontational \u2013 taking the book\u2019s title, a common Afrikaans anti-gay slur, as his cue on that front. \u201cI know it\u2019s a very triggering film \u2013 it had to be,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an overwhelming range of reactions to the film in South Africa: some from gay men who had been to the army and felt identified and recognised, some from men who don\u2019t necessarily acknowledge the fact that they are still traumatised. One member of the press had a panic attack at a screening. These are common experiences but they haven\u2019t been widely addressed in South African culture.\u201d\nThough the film is set in the whites-only domain of the army, Hermanus doesn\u2019t skimp on depicting anti-black violence: \u201cIt was a dangerous choice, I know, to have all of the black characters be physical objects, victimised on the sidelines. But that\u2019s how it was: there\u2019s a white gaze there, and we needed to see that.\u201d He cites inspiration from the 2010 Abdellatif Kechiche historical drama Black Venus \u2013 which depicted the white objectification and abuse of black South African performer Saartjie Baartman, to divisive effect.\nHermanus is prepared for pushback on the point of view he\u2019s taken, but doesn\u2019t see South African cinema evolving via kid-glove treatment of its own ugly history. \u201cThe challenge in the South African film landscape right now is that it still seems to exist very much within racial boundaries: white money making nostalgia pieces for white people that are devoid of black people, and then you\u2019ve got black film-makers making romantic comedies and genre films about black lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThe films I make don\u2019t really exist in that market. And then I didn\u2019t want to make a safe film like Long Walk to Freedom, where you kind of get everyone\u2019s perspective on everything.\n\u201cSo I decided we were going to put the world in the headspace of white South Africa in the 80s, to show what that looked like from the inside,\u201d he concludes. Moffie delivers vividly and discomfitingly on that promise: Hermanus continues to make films that feel as bracing and urgent to locals as to international onlookers.\nMoffie is released on 24 April on Curzon Home Cinema.",

        "content": "With financial help reportedly secured, the most pressing issue now is to work on governments to get the season back underway\nIn the spectrum of power games currently being played in rugby league, Peter V\u2019landys and the NRL appear to now have the upper hand following a reported injection of $250m, secured through a loan from a consortium of British banks. The threats from broadcasters, who seemingly had the game over a barrel last week, now square off with an aggressive NRL who are holding the aces.\nNine can no longer threaten the viability of the league. Participants will be brought into the tent through the ability to offer financial security. The tables have turned and they have turned in favour of the NRL.\nV\u2019landys has been bullish about a 28 May return in spite of significant broadcaster backlash, government trepidation and internal disagreement about how the competition would be structured. He now looks like that confidence was well placed.\nNine looked to have scuppered the hopes of an early NRL return last week when they launched a scathing attack on the league in a thinly-veiled attempt to exit the current broadcasting arrangement that current management appear unhappy with. The broadcaster blamed the NRL for \u201cmismanagement of the code over many years\u201d and claimed the league \u201cwasted those funds\u201d brought in from broadcasting arrangements, \u201csquandered by a bloated head office\u201d.\nNine CEO Hugh Marks met with V\u2019landys at Racing NSW offices on Tuesday, a meeting described by a buoyant V\u2019landys as \u201cconstructive\u201d. News Limited publications on Wednesday reported, however, that Nine want the 2020 season scrapped and a new two-year reworked deal signed. Nine newspapers meanwhile reported this would mean dropping Thursday Night Football coverage, forcing Fox Sports to drop the Friday 6pm game and removing simulcasting, with Nine\u2019s outlay to be significantly less than what it currently pays the game.\nWhile Fox Sports have been far less vocal about their views on what the game needs to look like in 2020 despite missing their 1 April payment to the NRL, their subscription-driven model means they would likely welcome a return as soon as possible.\nWith the cash injection from British banks brokered by Oakwell Sports Advisory, V\u2019landys will now be increasingly unlikely to rework any deal with Nine, meaning the broadcaster will be expected to broadcast any games played and pay for the same. There is only an infinitesimal chance that the season will be scrapped \u2013 something that would result in a $130m saving to Nine that was part of a $266m cost-saving plan presented at the JP Morgan virtual conference \u2013 and the NRL are unlikely to leave any money on the table that they don\u2019t have.\nMore pressing for V\u2019landys and the NRL will be working with governments to get the competition stood back up. While the NRL has received the support of the NSW government, led by deputy premier John Barilaro who has volunteered to help the game at an all-of-government level, there has been resistance from both the Queensland government and the federal bureaucracy while the prime minister remains cautious.\nWhile Scott Morrison called the proposed 28 May return date \u201cambitious\u201d, the league fan did say: \u201cI like they\u2019ve got an ambitious date.\u201d Queensland premier Anastasia Palaszczuk was far more sceptical and said there would be no travel exemptions for rugby league and that State of Origin was unlikely to be held in Queensland in 2020, also scuppering any plans for an \u201cNRL Island\u201d or a bubble near the central Queensland city of Gladstone.\nThe most pressing government-facing issue for the NRL outside of adhering to health guidelines is working to get exemptions for travel. New Zealand Warriors CEO Cameron George said his club had received no detail around travel plans for his team while there has been no official stance taken by any state government to go with no firm plan by the NRL.\nIf the NRL is to be played exclusively in Sydney \u2013 the most likely scenario \u2013 the Warriors, the three Queensland clubs and Melbourne Storm would all likely need to go into quarantine by this weekend. It appears almost certain the competition will most likely be played in bubbles at ANZ Stadium and Penrith Stadium. There will likely be no crowds for the remainder of the season.\nThere has been no decision made on the structure with options ranging from a 15-round season concluding at the regular time and a full season wrapping up in December, but one high-ranking club official estimates a 20-round season is the most likely outcome. Points accrued across the first two rounds will remain despite noise being made about all teams starting from zero. State Of Origin is a very real chance of opening the season as it will be significantly easier to manage fewer numbers of players.\nThe NRL still has plenty of work to do to colour in the outline of their plan. They need to gain majority approval from stakeholders on the structure. They need to properly incentivise participants to leave their families and enter a bubble. They need to work their way through government bureaucracy. But while V\u2019landys can drive a train through the eye of a needle, even he understands that the game cannot resume without at least the tacit approval of health officials.",

        "content": "Mixed messages as Victoria starts term two with a plea for families to stay home and use remote learning during the coronavirus crisis\nThe Australian education minister has told parents they shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about sending their children to school, as the Victorian government launched term two with a plea for families to stay at home and undertake remote learning wherever possible.\nThe mixed messages come ahead of another meeting of the national cabinet on Thursday, when leaders are expected to discuss further steps to safeguard the health and safety of teachers.\nThroughout the coronavirus crisis, the Australian government has maintained that its health advice is that children are at low risk from attending school, although it has conceded there are issues to ensure the safety of teachers, particularly in higher risk groups such as those of advanced age and with underlying medical conditions.\nVictorian state schools are the first to resume after the Easter holidays, following a pupil-free day on Tuesday. The state government has urged parents to keep their children at home and undertake the new system of online, remote learning wherever possible.\nSchools will resume in other states and territories over the next two weeks. Many jurisdictions are opting to provide remote and online learning, with on-site instruction still available for those who need it.\n\u201cIf you can have your kids educated at home, that\u2019s exactly what you must do,\u201d the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Wednesday.\nAndrews added that every Victorian government school was open for those who were unable to learn at home \u2013 including vulnerable children, those with special needs, or those whose parents were working. But he said he was grateful to families who were keeping their children at home.\n\u201cThat is essential to avoiding the spread of this virus,\u201d Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.\n\u201cIf you think about it, common sense simply dictates if you\u2019ve got a million kids getting to and from school, a full complement of teachers, parents moving around the community, dropping kids off, picking them up \u2013 that is not at all consistent with social distancing rules.\u201d\nThe federal government has made no secret of its desire for schools to resume normal instruction as quickly as possible and has emphasised that many frontline workers need to be able to send their children to class.\nIn a video message on Wednesday, Scott Morrison sought to reach out to teachers, saying students and families were relying on them more than ever.\n\u201cI want teachers to know from me, both as a parent and as a prime minister, just how appreciated you are and how important the job is that you\u2019re doing right now, and how much you are needed,\u201d Morrison said.\nWarning that the education of our children \u201changs in the balance\u201d, the prime minister said many students would continue distance learning, but some did not have this choice, particularly for families who were disadvantaged and on lower incomes.\n\u201cIt is even more essential for those vulnerable students who we know won\u2019t get an education at home,\u201d Morrison said.\n\u201cThese children need you for our schools to remain open. They need you as our great teachers, more than ever. We cannot allow a situation where parents are forced to choose between putting food on the table through their employment to support their kids and their kids\u2019 education.\u201d\nThe federal education minister, Dan Tehan, backed up this message, saying the government had \u201cgreat concerns\u201d about vulnerable children suffering as a result of the pandemic.\nTehan said, for example, that a family with three or four children at home but just one computer would face a \u201cvery tough\u201d situation undertaking remote learning. Regional and rural settings were another challenge.\n\u201cCan I say, too, to all those parents who are out there working: please do not feel guilty about sending your students to school,\u201d Tehan said during a media conference in Canberra.\n\u201cYou are playing a vital role in helping our economy, helping our society get through this. You are playing a vital role in us dealing with this pandemic, so we want you to be able to safely know that your children are getting the education that they want at school, because school\u2019s open for you, while you\u2019re working.\u201d\nMeredith Peace, the president of the Australian Education Union\u2019s Victorian branch, said her members felt that the official messaging around schools had been confusing.\nSpeaking to the ABC, she said public messages about the importance of physical distancing and staying at home contrasted with Morrison\u2019s apparent plea for teachers to be at school.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nPeace said teachers, principals and support staff throughout Victoria were working hard to continue to educate students, whether they were at home or school. She said she had heard early reports of a small number of students attending school in person on Wednesday.\nBut Peace called on authorities to resolve the issue of the safety of staff in schools, as physical distancing was impossible in settings when 25 to 30 children were together with a teacher in a classroom. \u201cWe need that issue addressed if we\u2019re going to have all of our students and staff return to schools,\u201d Peace said.\nThe New South Wales Teachers Federation described the current arrangements as \u201cemergency learning\u201d. Its president, Angelo Gavrielatos, argued that as health restrictions begin to be eased, the return to regular schooling should be carried out in stages, starting with kindergarten and year 12.\nThe nation\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Nick Coatsworth, told reporters the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee continued to view schools as safe places because of the low rates of transmission.\nHe confirmed the body was giving advice to the national cabinet on how to make schools safer for teachers and staff, signalling this was unlikely to include providing them with masks.\nBut the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, tweeted that he had advised the Victorian government to switch to remote learning for term two to reduce risks.\nThis is because having around a million children and their parents in closer contact with each other, teachers and other support staff has the potential to increase cases of coronavirus not just in schools but across the community. 2/3",

        "content": "With numbers plummeting and food hard to find, African penguins face a bleak future \u2013 but a novel conservation plan is under way\nIt\u2019s amazing to see wild creatures in their natural homes,\u201d says Gaja Rojec, as she sits next to a group of African penguins that don\u2019t seem at all bothered by her presence. It is late January 2020, and the Slovenian film-maker is just one of about 800,000 people who have visited Boulders Beach on South Africa\u2019s Cape Peninsula every year to get up close to these charismatic flightless birds.\nAt Boulders, just over an hour\u2019s drive south of central Cape Town, African penguins swim, loaf around and breed within a few metres of visitors, who can even get into the water with them. Penguins normally nest on offshore islands, but this small beach is surrounded by houses which form a barrier to land-based predators such as caracal lynxes and baboons, making it a \u201cpseudo island\u201d where the birds feel safe. They have bred here since the early 1980s, and it\u2019s now part of the Table Mountain national park.\nA visit to Boulders and its penguins is a high point of many South Africa trips, but the idyllic #bouldersbeach images that brighten more than 100,000 Instagram accounts mask a blunt fact: Spheniscus demersus is rapidly heading into extinction.\nThe species, which only breeds in South Africa and neighbouring Namibia, numbered about 1.5\u20133 million in the early 20th century. That dropped to 300,000 by 1956, and the numbers kept on falling. In 2018, just 15,000 pairs were found breeding in South Africa, and last year that slumped further to 13,300 pairs. About 5,500 pairs may still breed in Namibia, according to Namibian biologist Jessica Kemper, but no recent surveys have been done there.\nBecause only about 2% of its former population remains, the species is classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. A 2018 study predicts the \u201cfunctional extinction\u201d of African penguins from the west coast of South Africa by 2035 if current patterns are maintained.\nChristina Hagen of BirdLife South Africa says the main cause of the penguin\u2019s dramatic decline in recent decades is the lack of nutritious small fish \u2013 sardines and anchovies \u2013 left in the right areas of the ocean. Decades of overfishing off the south-west coast of Africa, once one of the world\u2019s richest fishing grounds and where the vast majority of penguin nesting islands are, have demolished many fish stocks.\n\u201cThe jellyfish are thriving, though, and that\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d says Kemper of the Namibian waters where huge numbers of seabirds used to feed on fish. Ocean warming appears to have pushed many of the remaining small pelagic fish away from the west coast to areas off the south coast of South Africa, where there are very few islands.\nNesting penguins starve if there are too few nutritious fish near breeding colonies; the parents can\u2019t hunt farther than 40km, at most, from the nest if they are to feed their young regularly. So Hagen and colleagues are pushing the traditional conservation envelope by trying to establish a new penguin colony on a stretch of the south coast of South Africa that has no offshore islands but is near some of the last remaining sardine stocks.\nThey identified a small headland in De Hoop nature reserve and turned it into a pseudo island by cutting it off from the mainland with a predator-proof fence. In January last year they stocked it with skilfully made concrete replicas of penguins along with speakers playing penguin calls to try to lure passing birds into nesting there.\nWhile this could be considered a mild form of assisted migration, the often controversial practice of moving species to new areas so they can keep up with changing environmental conditions, in this case the penguins are not being moved outside of their natural range, but are being encouraged to create a new breeding colony about 100km away from the nearest natural one.\nSo far the fake penguins haven\u2019t persuaded any wild birds to set up home in the new pseudo island, but Hagen will soon release young penguins from a Cape Town rehabilitation centre into De Hoop in the hope that this will lead them to breed there some years down the line, as penguins tend to breed at the places where they were raised.\nBut even if penguins breed at the new site and their youngsters leave the nest healthy and well-nourished, a large percentage still might not make it to maturity. Research has shown that the typical behaviour of young African penguins is not compatible with a warming, overexploited ocean.\nAdult African penguins prefer to hunt in groups because it is far more efficient than hunting alone. These adults aggressively exclude inexperienced, first-year birds \u2013 who are easily identified by their blue-grey plumage \u2013 from fishing parties so they do not disrupt the hunt.\nSo the young birds move away until they are of breeding age. Researchers who satellite-tracked young penguins found that they tend to move long distances from their original colonies \u2013 sometimes more than 1,000km \u2013 mostly to cooler, nutrient-rich areas of the ocean that historically were rich in small fish, but where numbers are now low.\nYoung penguins that spend their first years off the west coast of southern Africa, where fish stocks have collapsed most seriously, are far more likely to starve than those that go south and east, where fish stocks are healthier. It appears that young penguins are falling into what scientists from the University of Exeter and the University of Cape Town refer to as an \u201cecological trap\u201d, and this explains much of the overall population collapse. Even if birds breed at the new colony, their offspring might also fall into this trap.\nConservationists are now fighting on many fronts to keep African penguins alive, pointing out that thousands of other species are dependent on them and the cash they bring in from visitors. National park entry fees at Boulders Beach raised more than 72m rand (\u00a33.2m) in 2018-2019, helping to make Table Mountain one of South Africa\u2019s few parks to turn a profit and in turn subsididsing other parks in this megadiverse country. Since the Covid-19 outbreak and consequent shutdown of all South Africa\u2019s national parks, this income has \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 disappeared.\nBirdLife South Africa is working with the South African government to declare no-fishing zones around penguin colonies and juvenile feeding areas, but the process is slow and complicated, says Hagen.\nBut even if fishing stopped in the areas where sardines and anchovies were once abundant, stocks might not recover. Ecological \u201cstate shifts\u201d may have occurred, so that species such as jellyfish and gobies have moved in, for example, making it hard for sardines to reoccupy their place in the system even if they are no longer fished.\nHagen is not giving up on the birds, though. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that if all the conservation measures we\u2019re putting in place are successful, the penguins will survive,\u201d she says.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

Seven West Media is considered particularly at risk due to $683m of debt.\nDespite rebuffing calls to abolish content quotas and cut TV licence fees as recently as November, Fletcher extended an assistance package based on those measures on Wednesday.\nHe said the government was offering \u201curgent short-term support\u201d to the media sector because it was \u201cdoing it tough\u201d and in recognition of the fact \u201cpublic interest journalism is essential in informing and strengthening local communities\u201d.\nHe explained that content obligations had been suspended because Covid-19 had \u201ceffectively halted production of Australian screen content\u201d.\nIn addition to $51m in spectrum tax rebates, the government will create a $50m public interest newsgathering program for commercial television, newspaper and radio businesses in regional Australia.\nThe bulk of the funding for the program \u2013 $36m \u2013 will come from \u201crepurposing unallocated funds\u201d from the undersubscribed regional and small publishers jobs and innovation package.\nIn its digital platforms inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommended that the government restructure regional media grants, after criticism that the first round of \u201cinnovation\u201d grants was too restrictive.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nGuidelines for the new program would be released \u201cin coming weeks\u201d, Fletcher said, promising it would be \u201cavailable to a wider range of organisations\u201d than the earlier program, negotiated under a deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to loosen media ownership laws.\nFletcher also released an options paper by Screen Australia and the Australian Communications and Media Authority proposing \u201charmonising regulation to support Australian content\u201d \u2013 which could see online streaming services like Netflix and YouTube forced to produce Australian content, in line with a recommendation from the digital platforms inquiry.\n\u201cRegulated free-to-air broadcasters are competing with unregulated digital platforms and video streaming services,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cIt has been evident for some time \u2013 and the Covid-19 crisis has made it even more obvious \u2013 that this is not sustainable.\n\u201cThese arrangements threaten the sustainability of television broadcasters \u2013 and in turn the sustainability of the film and television content production sector.\u201d\nThe Labor communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said the package was \u201can admission of deep failure by this government, now in its seventh year\u201d.\n\u201cAustralian media was already in crisis before Covid-19,\u201d she said. \u201cFor years Labor has been calling on this government to overhaul the policy and regulatory framework and implement a real plan to support Australian content, public interest journalism and regional media in a landscape transformed by digitisation and convergence.\u201d\nRowland said the package was \u201calso an admission the Nick Xenophon-inspired regional and small publishers innovation fund is the failure Labor warned it would be, back when it was announced in 2017\u201d.\n\u201cThe government has only itself to blame for the poor results and wasted time.\u201d\nThe Greens communication spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the government had failed \u201cto offer any real relief\u201d to the arts and entertainment industry, and relaxation of local content quotas \u201cwill in fact make things worse for many thousands of artists and entertainers who have already lost their jobs\u201d.",

        "content": "For millions of young people, coronavirus restrictions have made access to food, water and shelter even more precarious\nTimothy, a teenager on the streets of Mombasa, wonders how he will eat. \u201cRich people can stay home \u2026 because they have a store well stocked with food,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a survivor on the street your store is your stomach.\u201d\nHowever, says another, if the rumours are true and street children are arrested in the city during the Covid-19 crisis, he\u2019d be happy to go to Shimo women\u2019s prison, because there \u201cyou are sure to get free food, shelter and medical services\u201d.\nAs the pandemic takes hold across the globe, few groups are as vulnerable as the children who rely on the streets for food and shelter, who risk being further stigmatised and criminalised when cities lock down. In Kenya\u2019s second city, a 7pm\u20135am curfew has been imposed, and fear is mounting.\n\u201cWe are all really worried,\u201d says Bokey Anchola, country director for Glad\u2019s House, an NGO working with hard to reach young people in Kenya. \u201cStreet children are having a rough time during the curfew. Food and water are a real problem as hotels and eating places where they would normally get food have closed down. Movement is restricted.\u201d\nThe closure of eateries, drop-in centres and feeding services, as well as the limits on movement, are just some aspects of a terrifying scenario for street children during the pandemic, say those working with young people in Kenya and elsewhere.\n\u201cStreet children are precisely in the space that everyone is supposed to be getting out of,\u201d says Duncan Ross, CEO of UK-based StreetInvest, which has launched an urgent appeal for its partner organisations working with street children and is calling for cities to allow them to lead the response. \u201cThe usual response to these children is: \u2018how do we get them off the streets\u2019, and Covid-19 has brought this into sharp focus.\u201d\nA global total of 100 million street children is often quoted, but the true number is believed to be much higher.\nWhile its partners have not reported police roundups yet, StreetInvest says lockdowns in many cities are still fresh and heavy-handed tactics are likely if the death tolls start rising. Street children are also likely to be caught up in outbreaks in slums, where social distancing and good hygiene are hard to observe.\nOn Monday plans were announced in Cameroon to clear thousands of homeless children from the streets of Yaound\u00e9, but it was not clear where they would be taken.\nMegan Lees-McCowan, head of Africa programmes at Street Child, said she feared Covid-19 would drive more children to the streets across Africa as schools shut and desperate families looked for alternative incomes. Last week the NGO helped hand out food to children in the Sierra Leone city of Waterloo, near Freetown; some recipients were as young as seven, and had gone for two days without eating.\n\u201cFor us, there is also the spectre of the past,\u201d said Lees-McCowan, recalling how during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, some children were abandoned by destitute families, and shunned by communities that suspected they carried the disease.\nFor Mpendulo Nyembe and his team at uMthombo in Durban, one early casualty of the coronavirus crisis has been trust; until Monday street workers in the South African city had been prevented from doing frontline work while the government took over. Private security firms hired to clear the streets were taking homeless youth to temporary shelters that lack qualified workers to look after them.\n\u201cYoung people on the streets were asking where we are. They said they were expecting to see our faces. But we couldn\u2019t engage with them. It is not OK that after a week of lockdown I was begging for permission to be with them,\u201d says Nyembe, whose organisation has now received a permit to do outreach work during the crisis.\nBefore South African president Cyril Ramaphosa announced a three-week lockdown on 27 March, Nyembe and his team were informing homeless youth about Covid-19 symptoms, offering advice and providing food. He is concerned the private security companies have increased fear, citing one encounter between a group of 11 youth and heavily armed guards. \u201cThey are terrified. We are terrified. The people dealing with them have no idea who these children are, of their backgrounds.\u201d\nRoss says: \u201cThe vulnerability of this group will go up [in the crisis], their need for services will go up and isolation won\u2019t protect them. The danger is that many people see them even more as diseased and criminal. Anecdotally, this is already happening.\u201d\nA 2016/17 study found there were between 9,000\u201310,000 street children in Durban, but Nyembe believes the number has since doubled due to the availability of drugs, mainly heroin-based \u201cwhoonga\u201d. He warns that the health and lives of children using drugs or alcohol \u2013 or who are HIV-positive \u2013 are at greater risk if they cannot access the right treatment, or if they have to go through sudden withdrawal.\nIn Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, many police now understand that for some children the street is home, says Paul Sunder Singh, founder of NGO Karunalaya. But as small businesses have shut up shop in the lockdown, jobs that earned street dwellers a pittance, like carrying goods in markets or selling food to drivers, have vanished. Pavement dwellers are ordered to stay in makeshift structures and can not look for food.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s survival is suddenly in jeopardy. Many families that live on the streets have been there for generations. They have no stocks and could starve,\u201d says Sunder Singh, adding that the government is asking companies and NGOs to donate food.\nAnother fear is that the virus could drive homeless children back to families where they are at risk of abuse, he says.\nThere is also a sense that the coronavirus crisis could set back years of progress on childrens\u2019 legal situation, says Si\u00e2n Wynne, of StreetInvest, pointing out that the UN general comment on street children grants rights to freely assemble in a public space, but that Covid-19 is altering everyone\u2019s rights to occupy such spaces.\nRoss says: \u201cIf this crisis brings understanding that we need a specific response for street children, that would be a good thing. If it makes other people see these children as we do, as young people with fuller potential who are facing tough challenges, that would also be a good thing.\n\u201cWe need to deal with the realities of their existence rather than just wish these children away.\u201d\nFor homeless youth like Alfred, in Mombasa, for now the most pressing reality is the need for food. \u201cThe police have told us they don\u2019t want to see us around after 7pm. Are we going to die of hunger instead of coronavirus?\u201d",

        "content": "Previous suspensions have seen radical changes proposed, some of which were rejected only to be introduced later when the opportunity to capture public attention had already passed\nThe most popular book in the makeshift library at the Tarsao prisoner of war camp was a bible, the second a copy of the 1939 Wisden Almanack. It belonged to Jim Swanton and so many people wanted to borrow it that he\u2019d only lend it for six hours at a time.\nHe had carried the book with him from Britain, through Nova Scotia and South Africa, to Singapore, where he was captured by the Japanese. Swanton repaired it over and again, bound it with rice paste and recovered it with rubber. He used it to invent pretend radio commentaries for the other internees and as the basis for a lecture on \u201cThe Life of Bradman\u201d.\nLost in Wisden, Swanton wrote, \u201cour minds were strangely at peace\u201d. There wasn\u2019t any first-class cricket being played, even if they had had a way to follow it, but there was solace in the thought of the game, in the memory of what it had been before it all started and the promise of what it would be once it was all over. During the English summer the County Championship runs like a clock, the tick-tock of runs and wickets unbroken through the season. You notice it most when it\u2019s stopped.\nIn that \u201939 Wisden, among the reports of Len Hutton\u2019s 364 against Australia at the Oval, an obituary of Lord Hawke and a tribute to Frank Woolley, there\u2019s an article by Bradman, which he called Cricket at the Crossroads. \u201cNo matter how much we love cricket,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe cannot possibly disassociate its future from the cold, hard facts of finance. Nor can we blind ourselves to the fact that at this very moment public support for cricket suggests either that cricket is becoming less attractive or other forms of entertainment are gaining ground.\n\u201cWith the quickening of modern tempo, the more Americanised trend which is demanding speed, action and entertainment value, it behoves all of us to realise we are the custodians of the welfare of cricket and must guard its future even more zealously than its present.\u201d Bradman argued for better pitches, a change to the lbw law, and more modern scoreboards. \u201cI am quite sure the administrators of England and Australia are more closely united now than ever before. To me, therefore, it seems an appropriate time to try and achieve a greater measure of uniformity of opinion.\u201d\nBradman\u2019s words echo in both directions. You find similar when the County Championship was suspended for the first time, in 1914, and they still sound familiar now when it has been suspended again, for the first time since its postwar resumption in 1946. Either cricket mirrors life so closely that its crises are synchronised with everyone else\u2019s or it is a game in perpetual ill health. But either way, on both previous occasions when play stopped in the County Championship, the break was used as an opportunity to debate what was wrong with the game and how best to try to fix it.\nDuring the first world war the game was in a fret, again, about its waning popularity with the public, worried that its slow tempo was out of touch with the fast times. \u201cIt occurred to some peculiar people that cricket stood in need of drastic alterations,\u201d the Wisden editor, Sydney Pardon, wrote in 1919. So the authorities decided to cut county matches down to two days and play longer each day. They considered scrapping the tea break, shortening boundaries and penalising the batting side for maiden overs. The Times even floated a plan to ban left-handers to save time altering the field between deliveries.\nPardon felt the authorities blundered by tinkering too much. The two-day matches were scrapped the following season, when games were played over the old length of three days. \u201cI trust,\u201d he wrote in that year\u2019s Wisden, \u201cwe shall hear no more about the need for drastic alterations in the game.\u201d His trust was misplaced. By 1939, the game was going through it all over again.\nDuring the war years, large crowds had turned out for exhibition one-day games at Lord\u2019s. Sir Home Gordon wrote: \u201cOne wartime development is that spectators have become thrilled over close finishes.\u201d There was a drive, in the mid-1940s, to introduce a one-day knockout cup, to be played on Sundays, to scrap the distinction between amateurs and professionals \u2013 all proposals that would come to pass, decades later, but were rejected at the time by authorities who, Swanton wrote, \u201ccondemned without hesitation all proposals to tamper with the fundamentals of the game\u201d.\nThey wanted also to cut county matches back from three days to two, but that plan was rejected as well. This time they erred the other way and the upshot was that they postponed reform so long they ended up performing emergency surgery on the game in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nAnd in 2020 the game is in the throes of a similar debate, as it weighs the competing needs of 18 counties and four separate formats. The most recent of these, the Hundred, is wildly unpopular with a lot of the people who love the others. Its few supporters argue, however, that it is the best way to sustain cricket in the long term. The ECB has said economic necessity dictates it will prioritise the T20 Blast if and when play resumes this summer, with the Hundred in the balance.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s the bigger question of how it all fits together, of what it is we\u2019re all pining for here: the game as it was or the game as we want it to be? This break is one last opportunity to ask whether the sport really wants to press on with these radical changes or reconsider them altogether.",

However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d it stated.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nUnderlying WHO\u2019s concerns are the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.\nThere is also concern the public will not understand how to use a mask and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.\nMost of all, there is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form or trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them.\nN95 masks, worn by doctors and nurses who are treating people with Covid-19, certainly do. But the virus particles are thought to pass through other types of mask.\nNevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected by the virus.\nIt is accepted that they can block the transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.\nIn the US, Donald Trump has advised people to wear masks whenever they go out, while stressing it is not compulsory, citing advice from the Centers for Disease Control. In France, the Academy of Medicine has recommended the use of a \u201cgeneral public\u201d mask \u2013 to differentiate it from the mask used by healthcare workers.\nThere is now increasing pressure for the UK stance on masks to change. Even marginal gains could make a difference is at the heart of the argument.\nProf Trisha Greenhalgh from the Nuffield department of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, and colleagues wrote a paper published by the British Medical Journal last week that argued in favour of \u201cthe precautionary principle\u201d.\nThe standard level of scientific evidence is no good in this issue, she told the Guardian. Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard in drug development, but not appropriate to face masks in a pandemic, she said.\n\u201cThe point is we have now got a hugely complex issue going on. The last thing we need is a controlled experiment. We need to follow the logic of complex systems,.\u201d\nGreenhalgh thinks the whole population of the UK should wear masks \u2013 just as they do in South Korea, where the epidemic curve is far lower than ours.\nWe could make that acceptable, she said, by making it fun \u2013 encouraging people to make and personalise their own.\nEven if masks do not become the norm, it is quite possible they will anyway become part of the strategy for the exit from lockdown, at which point not only will every possible way of preventing new infections be considered, but the public will be so keen to resume \u201cnormal\u201d life that it is hard to imagine anyone refusing to comply.",

But he said it was essential for more details to be disclosed about how the government plans to leave the lockdown, as ministers would need to start planning for the availability of mass community testing.\nIn a round of broadcast interviews on the BBC, LBC and Sky, Starmer said the government \u201ccan\u2019t just park this\u201d and ought to publish its \u201cprinciples and approach\u201d so that people can have an idea how the lockdown might end.\nHe said, for example, there was a good argument for measures such as the mandatory use of face masks, which France and Austria were looking at.\nStarmer also expressed concerns that inequalities would be growing between children whose parents were putting effort into homeschooling them and those who were not.\n\u201cThe longer the schools are closed, the bigger the gap between children who are getting pretty good homeschooling and those that aren\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nHe said he thought reopening schools and mass testing should be among the first priorities but he could not set out his own timetable or a \u201crival strategy\u201d.\nHis requests for an exit strategy were set out in a letter to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who is deputising for Boris Johnson while the prime minister recuperates from coronavirus at Chequers.\nA government source dismissed the idea of setting out a plan this week before the death rate has come down, saying: \u201cOur strategy is focused on saving lives. We have been clear that all decisions will be guided by the scientific advice and data. Talk of an exit strategy before we have reached the peak risks confusing the critical message that people need to stay at home in order to protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d\nScientific advisers including Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, have said it is too early to talk about lifting the lockdown.\nThere are splits in the cabinet about when to end the lockdown but an exit plan is unlikely to emerge until Johnson is back at work and the tide has begun to turn on the UK\u2019s high death rate in hospitals and care homes.\nWith projections showing a huge hit to the economy, Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, said he agreed that it was important to \u201cphase out this lockdown as soon as we possibly can based on scientific advice\u201d.\nHe also told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that he would as chancellor have looked at guaranteeing 100% of emergency loans to businesses amid reports that banks are refusing to lend.\nAsked about Labour\u2019s strategy of trying to be constructive in its criticism, Starmer said there was a need to challenge the government without scoring points.\nHe said he was worried about the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medics and care workers, the failure to hit testing targets and a lack of transparency around scientific advice to the government.\nOn testing, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not as confident as I would like to be. We are supposed to be at 100,000 tests in two weeks\u2019 time. I haven\u2019t heard a good answer about why we are behind the curve still.\u201d\nHe said the government had been too slow in bringing in a lockdown, while stressing that now was not the time to interrogate past mistakes.\nAsked whether the government should publish details about the scientific advisers on the crucial Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and their advice, he said: \u201cI think they should and I genuinely think this is a situation where the more the public can see the more they will trust.\u201d\nHe said everyone was \u201canxious\u201d about the lockdown and their economic positions, and people needed \u201chope and light at the end of the tunnel\u201d.\nHelen Whately, a health minister, defended the government\u2019s position on Wednesday morning, and promised testing would be increased for care home workers and residents.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe have been doing everything that we can to protect those really vulnerable people living in care homes or receiving care at home.\n\u201cFrom the moment it looked like coronavirus was coming our way ... we have been working really hard to do whatever we can to protect those receiving care from this truly awful, horrible illness.\u201d\nBut she also risked infuriating medics and care workers by suggesting some PPE was not always being used appropriately.\n\u201cPeople have been crying out wanting to use PPE all the time for everything and actually that is not the best use for it. It has to be used when necessary,\u201d she said.",

I can press a button to go left or right, and up or down. Rather cruelly, the on-screen controls also allow me to make the guide \u201crun\u201d and, bizarrely, \u201cjump\u201d on the spot. I can\u2019t resist as the camera pans down onto a black sand beach and the disembodied voice declares (even more breathlessly) that he really enjoys running on sand. The highlight of this atavistic performance is when an anonymous user makes the guide head for slippery rocks and an incoming wave swamps his legs and feet, prompting a shout of \u201cOh God, I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d\nAn hour passes quickly in the online company of Levi, my guide, a former player for the Faroe Islands\u2019 national football team, who is still very fit. Though it\u2019s fair to say that at the end of it I have seen rather too much of the half-dozen alleyways of B\u00f8ur, which is home to only about 70 people. However, as the camera is propelled up and down the quiet roads and in between turf-roofed houses, I am immersed in the sounds and sights of the Faroes, rugged hills, misty sea-scapes and colourful grazing sheep.\nIn fact, this is not a computer game but an experience provided by a camera being worn by a real person \u2013 a \u201ctour guide\u201d \u2013 who responds to commands from anonymous people anywhere in the world. I feel like I\u2019ve been back in the islands enjoying the fresh Atlantic breeze. Thanks to remote-tourism.com, a new marketing campaign launched on Wednesday, you too can exercise a very personal level of control over a Faroese person who has volunteered to be your guide.\nThis year should have seen tourism revenues double in these remote north Atlantic islands from a base of around \u00a360m five years ago. Coronavirus has ended that ambition, but to combat at least some of those losses and keep the destination fresh in people\u2019s minds, a new interactive online guide service has been launched. According to Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 H\u00f8jgaard, director of Visit Faroe Islands, the remotely operated guide is \u201ca unique platform to allow people in isolation to take a walk across our wild landscapes and regain a sense of freedom\u201d.\nThe guides may be in kayaks, on horseback or hiking around the mountain villages. Being halfway between Shetland and Iceland has always meant that the Faroese have had to rely on their wits to survive. Scaling the cliffs to catch seabirds, herding sheep in the mountains or braving the North Atlantic in small fishing boats have, until very recently, all been an essential part of survival for the islands\u2019 50,000 people. And they have relied on their wits to market their islands, too. H\u00f8jgaard was tasked with doubling Faroes tourist revenues over the past five years, and 2019 saw more than 100,000 visitors to the 18 islands.\nShe has overseen a number of innovative marketing schemes in the past few years. In 2017 it was Sheep View, where cameras were attached to some of the islands\u2019 80,000 sheep in a spoof version of Google Street View, and last year it was announced that for one weekend the country was Closed for Maintenance, and open only to 100 foreign volunteers who could travel to the islands to help maintain paths, erect signposts and landscape viewpoints at some of the most well trammelled beauty spots.\nThe remotely steered Faroese tours will be online twice daily at 2pm and 5pm (BST) for a period of 10 days initially. Users will have two minutes of control over the guide, who all speak English, but can rejoin the queue any number of times. The ability to operate a live streaming service smoothly is dependent on the islands\u2019 super-fast broadband connections, which cover almost all of the territory and mean that, in spite of the remote location, internet download speeds are faster than in London, and second only to South Korea.\nHaving invested heavily in tourism marketing over the past few years, the current crisis has hit just when two 200-room hotels were about to open in the capital, T\u00f3rshavn, and the capital\u2019s prestigious Hotel F\u00f8royar is halfway through an ambitious building programme to double its room capacity. This was the year that should have seen bed-nights double to a total of 200,000 \u2013 excluding an unspecified number of Airnbnb rooms.\nTim Ecott\u2019s latest book is The Land of Maybe: A Faroe Islands Year (Short Books, \u00a314.99)",

There are also fears Beijing will begin to interfere with new judicial appointments.\nIt said Beijing was seeking to hobble the judiciary, posing the gravest threat since the territory was handed back to China by the UK in 1997.\nIn a ruling that partially upheld a face mask ban enacted by Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s court of appeal also pushed back at accusations that its role in assessing the constitutionality of laws was an affront to Beijing.\n\u201cWe know from our interactions with senior mainland judges that they just don\u2019t get Hong Kong at all,\u201d said one judge. \u201cThey always want to know why Hong Kong is so confused and chaotic, and not \u2018patriotic\u2019.\u201d\nThis week the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) also accused opposition lawmakers of abusing their power and creating a legislation backlog, failing to appoint a House committee chairman, and paralysing the legislative council.\nThe HKMAO, which was defended by pro-Beijing figures in the legislative council, suggested the lawmakers might be guilty of misconduct.\nPan-democrat lawmakers rejected the statement, accusing Beijing of \u201cblatant intervention\u201d and breaching the separation of powers, which escalated into a continuing war of words with pro-Beijing legislators.\nOn Wednesday, the Hong Kong bar association urged the Chinese offices to exercise restraint, as its statements could \u201ceasily be perceived as interference in contravention of the principle of one country, two systems\u201d.\nMartin Lee QC, a pro-democracy veteran, politician and barrister, said: \u201cFor the past two decades Beijing has been reneging on its promises on democracy. If you look at the Basic Law it\u2019s stated quite clearly that universal suffrage is the ultimate goal for the election of the chief executive and all members of the legislature.\u201d\nHe said the terms of the handover from British rule to China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u2019 policy said that Hong Kong would have full democracy after 10 years, but it had been 23 years and \u201cwe have no idea when we will finally reach that goal\u201d.\nLee said he believed Beijing and its supporters were delaying the promise, and \u201cresorting to all kinds of tricks\u201d with Hong Kong elections to stifle pro-democracy candidates out of a reasonable fear that they might win power.",

If you have a colleague or loved one we should include, please contact us here.\nLost on the frontline is a project by the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to honor every healthcare worker in the US \u2013 from doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics \u2013 who dies from Covid-19 during the pandemic.\nThese are the frontline health workers who risk their own lives to care for the sick. In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. But no reliable national database exists to track their deaths. As of 10 July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 510 deaths among health workers \u2013 but our reporting shows that is likely an undercount.\nSome of these deaths are preventable. Across the world, healthcare workers face a disproportionate risk of severe infection from coronavirus due to their high exposure to sick patients. But in the US, a lack of preparedness for the pandemic increased that risk. Inadequate access to testing among the general population, a nationwide shortage of protective gear such as N95 masks, and lack of basic supplies like hand sanitizer are driving up the death toll among health workers.\nCollectively, our healthcare workforce has already saved thousands of lives. And in the face of a pandemic so dangerous that families can\u2019t visit sick relatives, these workers are often the last people to comfort the dying. But some won\u2019t make it themselves. While we can\u2019t profile everyone in depth, our goal is to mark every death that we can confirm. The nationwide database we create will allow us to identify patterns and find new stories about the unfolding pandemic and its impact on healthcare workers, shedding light on the workings, and failings, of the healthcare system.\nOur count will include any healthcare worker who was likely exposed while helping patients with Covid-19 during the pandemic. That includes nurses, paramedics, doctors and other medical workers who treat patients, operate ambulances and take X-rays. It includes nursing home staff and home health aides who are caring for patients outside of hospitals. It includes cleaners, porters, administrators and other on-site staff who are disinfecting hospital rooms, washing linens and managing crucial operations to help our healthcare system function in crisis.\nWe hope this project will become a collective memorial to honor their sacrifices. But we can\u2019t do it alone. We\u2019re asking the family members, friends and colleagues of healthcare workers to contribute by sharing information, photos and stories about their loved ones and co-workers who died while taking care of patients infected with coronavirus. You can share information here.\nWe\u2019re also inviting news organizations across the country to partner with us. We will link to local newsroom stories about workers in their communities who have died, and we will invite them to co-publish our stories. We will also work with partners to produce content in multiple languages to reflect the rich diversity of America\u2019s healthcare workforce and reach the many communities in America experiencing loss.\nBecause of the scope of the project, and the many categories of workers we\u2019ve chosen to include, this database may never be completely comprehensive. It will function as an imperfect work in progress \u2013 and grow over time.\nYou can reach the editors of this project at frontline@theguardian.com.\nWe hope this project will honor those lost to the pandemic \u2013 and spark ideas for positive change in our healthcare system.",

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.\nA widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days has led to it being touted in some quarters as a potential cure for Covid-19. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.\nHowever, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigour to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea. US president Donald Trump has claimed he takes hydroxychloroquine despite FDA warnings.\nHere is a guide to the scientific studies into hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus carried out so far.\nRegardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not. The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.\nOliver Milman\n\u201cThey gave me chloroquine,\u201d she told American TV channel CBS. \u201cI know people have been talking about this drug. But I can only tell you that \u2013 I don\u2019t know if the drug worked or if it was just time for the fever to break.\n\u201cMy fever did break but the chloroquine had such extreme side effects, I was completely nauseous, I had vertigo and my muscles felt very weak \u2026 I think people have to be very considerate about that drug.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Gold Coast University hospital would not confirm whether Hanks and Wilson were given chloroquine, but said that \u201cselected patients\u201d did receive the drug.\n\u201cGold Coast Health has used a variety of medication in patients with more severe Covid-19,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cChloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir have been used on selected patients.\u201d\nTrump proclaimed the chemical\u2019s effectiveness in March, but the US\u2019s top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned that there is not enough medical evidence to prove that it is useful.\nAustralian researchers have also said it could cause potentially life-threatening side-effects, such as heart damage.\nIn March, a man in Arizona died after taking chloroquine phosphate \u2013 a chemical used to clean fish tanks \u2013 after Trump\u2019s advice. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d his wife told NBC.\nLast week, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 the expert panel on health emergencies \u2013 recommended against using the drugs in hospitals, contradicting the federal health department.\nThe department has told hospitals they can prescribe the drug \u201cin a controlled environment in the treatment of severely ill patients in hospital\u201d, after the government waived therapeutic goods registration requirements to fast-track their import into Australia.\nWilson and Hanks have both recovered from the illness, and said their blood had been taken for a study to determine the level of antibodies they developed.\nWATCH: In her first interview since her COVID-19 diagnosis, @RitaWilson says she's feeling great \u2014 and giving back.Wilson told @GayleKing about the story behind her #HipHopHooray remix benefiting @MusiCares, her journey to recovery, and her symptoms when she first got sick. pic.twitter.com/yF3IZrFjCS",

        "content": "Alan Yang\u2019s film about the lack of understanding between generations strikes a chord, and is so relevant as coronavirus racism spreads\nInflamed by President Trump\u2019s casual phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d, anti-Asian sentiment is erupting all over the world. As a British-Vietnamese person who has been spat on because of the colour of her skin, the film Tigertail is a glimmer of hope \u2013 a way of showing the truth, and connecting Asian communities at a time when panic and misinformation serve to break us apart. Alan Yang\u2019s multi-generational love story Tigertail weaves in Yang\u2019s cultural self-discovery and features memories of Taiwan, as experienced by the protagonist Pin-Jui. Weighted against the present tide of anti-Asian bigotry, this tender story about honesty and lost love is more relevant than ever.\n\u201cAmerican culture has been negligent in portraying Asian-American people as fully realised human beings,\u201d Yang told the Deadline podcast. Yang, who worked on Parks and Recreation before co-creating Master of None, recalled the trepidation he felt in the early days of his career, in a cultural landscape where east Asians were rarely represented, or stereotyped as hardworking automatons. Yang said he had felt restricted to using only white characters in his early pilots, fearing that all-Asian or Asian-American scripts would never be accepted. But this was before the film successes of Crazy Rich Asians, The Farewell and Parasite brought real Asian faces to mainstream culture.\nI felt utter joy and relief at seeing my own identity conflicts explored on screen. With dialogue almost entirely in Mandarin and Taiwanese from an all-Asian cast, Tigertail illuminates the Taiwanese immigrant experience by showing it through emotions. Yang\u2019s drama traces the journey of Taiwanese factory worker Pin-Jui from his home town to America, as well as the sometimes painful discord that separates us from those we love the most. A rallying cry against caricatures of the stoic \u201cAsian dad\u201d, Tigertail lays bare the complexity of Pin-Jui\u2019s interiority: the path he takes towards his American dream, how he stumbles and learns from his mistakes and how he grows from them. The film moves between his life as a young man in the 1960s and the present day in New York. The dual time-frames reveal a mind shifting uneasily between a new, chosen culture and the vibrant one left behind. In the present-day timeline \u2013 deliberately desaturated and drained of vibrancy \u2013 an older Pin-Jui struggles to empathise with his US-born daughter Angela, who has spent her life feeling as if she couldn\u2019t talk to her father.\nThat resonated deeply with me. My parents fled to Britain as Vietnamese refugees in their late teens. Because my father speaks very basic English and I speak poor Vietnamese, honest feelings cannot easily be communicated between us. The unrest within Asian families comes not from what is said out loud, but often from what is left unsaid. This cultural muteness echoes throughout Tigertail. In the film\u2019s opening sequence, a young Pin-Jui sobs in desperation for his parents. \u201cCrying never solves anything,\u201d his grandmother scolds him sternly in Taiwanese. \u201cBe strong. Never let anyone see you cry.\u201d In many Asian traditions, including my own, the way to be strong is to conceal your emotions. But non-traditional circumstances call upon us to readjust. How can this silence persist during a global pandemic, when the elderly are being asked to isolate themselves entirely?\nPiecing together my family\u2019s story has helped me grasp the sacrifices that my family made in order to secure hope for the next generation. It\u2019s brought me closer to my parents. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate their perspective and our differences. Like Pin-Jui\u2019s leap into the unknown, my family\u2019s journey paved the way for successive generations, even if each generation is a little further from that original sacrifice, a little more removed from the country that was once home.\nWhile Yang\u2019s personal life informs Tigertail in many ways, the film is also about being human and knowing that we can\u2019t face hurt on our own. It reinforces the perseverance and strength of the Asian community in embracing new lives, often at the cost of giving up another. Tigertail\u2019s window into a Taiwanese-American family speaks volumes for those who have felt unable to express themselves, through being marginalised or because they don\u2019t know how to.\n Georgina Quach is a freelance journalist",

By 3.30pm he reached \u00a32m, and had passed \u00a34m by midnight.\nOn Wednesday morning his Twitter account said: \u201c6 MILLION POUNDS!! Thank you everyone, this is all for our incredible NHSCharities.\u201d\nMoore, who lives with his family in Bedfordshire, told the BBC: \u201cI think that\u2019s absolutely enormous. At no time when we started off with this exercise did we anticipate we\u2019d get anything near that sort of money.\n\u201cIt just shows that people have such high regard for matters of our National Health Service and it\u2019s really amazing that people have paid so much money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost unbelievable isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe number has continued to climb, and shortly after the veteran was name-checked by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in the Downing Street daily briefing on Wednesday, the total passed the \u00a38m mark. By the evening it was well on the way to \u00a310m\nHe is walking 10 laps of the garden a day with the help of his walking aid, and had hoped to hit 100 laps in time for his birthday on 30 April \u2013 but according to his daughter, Hannah, he is likely to reach his goal on Thursday.\nMoore served in the second world war after being selected for officer training in 1940 and completed postings in India and Sumatra. He returned to work as an instructor at an armoured fighting vehicle school in Bovington, Dorset.\n\u201cOur brave nurses and doctors are frontline in this case \u2026 this time our army are in doctors and nurses uniforms and they\u2019re doing a marvellous job,\u201d Moore said.\nHis wife was ill for several years and died in 2006, while Moore had been treated for a broken hip and skin cancer, so he continued to feel a close connection with the NHS, his daughter said.\nHannah said that although her father was overwhelmed when he raised \u00a31m he responded with a determination to walk more.\nShe said: \u201cHe\u2019s a typical Yorkshireman, so he\u2019s very stoic, very controlled and takes everything in his stride. We always knew that he was this incredible gem of a man, but we never had any idea that his story would capture the hearts of the nation.\n\u201cWe thought we could give people a little bit of happy and we wanted to share a little bit about him, and it has just gone beyond even our wildest, wildest, dreams.\u201d\nAll the money Moore raises will be donated to NHS Charities Together to go towards wellbeing packs and rest and recuperation centres for staff on the frontline, as well as electronic devices for patients to communicate with their families while in isolation.\nEllie Orton, the chief executive of NHS Charities Together, said: \u201cI think I join the rest of the country in being truly inspired and profoundly humbled by Capt Tom and what he\u2019s achieved.\nIn a direct message to Moore, she said: \u201cThank you from the bottom of our hearts, and thank you for being such a good role model \u2026 let\u2019s also get other people doing the same and following your example.\u201d\nA fellow war veteran, Harry Billinge MBE, 94, also offered his support: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased for you. Carry on, you\u2019re doing a good job. Carry on, old boy!\u201d\nHannah said she was feeling the pressure to make Moore\u2019s next birthday a special one after they had to cancel his big party.\nMoore has announced his determination to walk another 100 lengths if it means he can raise more money.\n Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

        "content": "Music has been shown to improve both productivity and cognitive performance, especially in adults\nIf you\u2019re attempting to work from home, a conundrum has probably presented itself: how can you get anything done in a distracting environment amid unsettled times?\nYour streaming service or record collection may hold the answer. Beyond providing background noise, music has been shown to improve both productivity and cognitive performance, especially in adults. Listening to music can help people manage anxiety, become motivated and stay productive. You just need to know how to make the right playlist.\nKick off the day with a trick from music therapy. The concept is known as the iso principle, which is a technique therapists use to alter the mood of a patient. The therapist will match music to how the patient is feeling, and then gradually alter the songs to achieve the desired mood state.\nThe songs at the beginning of the playlist shouldn\u2019t force you into a state of productivity, but they should gradually bring you there. While song choice will vary by person, Kirsten Nelson, a music therapist at the University of Iowa Stead family children\u2019s hospital, suggests tracks like Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles and Ooh Child, by the Five Stairsteps as places to start.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling really down in the morning, then find something peaceful to start with,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cFrom there, you can bring yourself into a more motivating song to achieve the state you want.\u201d\nResearchers have found that a faster track speed can result in increased performance. In one study that examined the relationship between music tempo and productivity, most test subjects performed best while listening to songs paced at around 121bpm. This is about as fast as tracks like Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Call Me Maybe, Whitney Houston\u2019s I Wanna Dance with Somebody, and I Will Survive, by Diana Ross.\nNelson refers to this phenomenon as finding the \u201cpower song\u201d, which can used to motivate the listener to be productive. \u201cI think that music can activate people in a way that other things cannot,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking to get into a place where we might have some more energy and motivation, a power song can be very helpful.\u201d Nelson says that adding power songs at strategic points in a work playlist, such as right when the day starts, while transitioning between tasks, and as the day ends, can help maintain motivation.\nNelson says that the choice to include lyrical tracks in a playlist should depend on individual preference. While research suggests that listening to upbeat, complex music can help workers stay alert and motivated while performing repetitive tasks, narrative lyrics can be distracting to those trying to do cognitive work. The bulk of a work playlist should include songs with innocuous or subtlely performed lyrics, such as those by artists like Grouper, Brian Eno and Jenny Hval. For those who prefer non-lyrical music, music by Dawn of Midi, Steve Reich and John Adams are great places to start.\nAnd, while lyrics can be a powerful motivator, don\u2019t automatically reach for your favorite tracks. One study found a decrease in performance while listening to songs characterized as \u201cfamiliar vocal music\u201d. The research suggests that, while it is important to listen to enjoyable music, songs that are very familiar can be distracting.\nCreating a work-from-home playlist should never feel like a chore. Rather, it can be something that accretes over time. \u201cIf you hear a song and know that it makes you feel good, pop it into a playlist,\u201d says Nelson. As the playlist grows, arrange tracks in the order that makes sense for the way you work. \u201cAllow yourself permission to listen to new music, try out new things, take things out, bring things in,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cAllow yourself that flexibility.\u201d If you don\u2019t feel like listening to your playlist, you don\u2019t have to.\nTracks 1-4 are for transitioning into work. Tracks 5-16 are good tracks for when you\u2019re in the flow. Tracks 17-20 are for transitioning back out.",

        "content": "The virus has swept one nursing home after another as one in five has seen an outbreak, resulting in about 4,800 deaths\nThe first alarming symptoms were spotted by nursing assistants three weeks ago, and word of the coughing patient sent a ripple of fear through the Detroit nursing home.\nThe staff had been on alert since a Washington state care home was engulfed by coronavirus, killing at least 35 people in the first major outbreak of Covid-19 in the US.\nThe virus has since swept from one nursing home to another across the country, leaping between patients and staff. Carers at the Ambassador nursing and rehabilitation center in Detroit, home to about 150 long-term elderly residents, were disturbed as the symptoms spread.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any protective gear,\u201d a nursing assistant, who did not wish to be publicly identified out of concern over losing her job, told the Guardian. \u201cWe had residents with symptoms and nothing to protect ourselves with \u2026 The management didn\u2019t seem like they really cared.\u201d\nPatients with symptoms were given masks but otherwise left sharing rooms with other elderly residents. A week ago, the nursing assistant tested positive for Covid-19.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because I\u2019m at home and I\u2019m worried about the patients when I should be worried about myself right now \u2026 I\u2019m frightened we are going to lose a lot of them,\u201d she said.\nWith about 1 million elderly residents, long-term care homes have emerged as incubators for Covid-19 outbreaks across the US. It is not a coincidence that the industry is already notorious for creaming profits off while pleading poverty in order to pay low wages to a workforce overwhelmingly of women, usually African American, Hispanic or immigrant. Too often, they are forced to take more than one job to make a living, a factor that has helped spread the virus between care centers.\nIn Europe, about half of coronavirus-related deaths in some countries have occurred in care homes. The situation is less clear in the US where the government is not issuing figures and some states, such as Florida, are refusing to identify which nursing homes have confirmed infections. A rough tally of states where figures are available suggests that at least one in five of the country\u2019s 15,000 residential care facilities has been hit by the virus, resulting in about 4,800 deaths. However, health specialists warn that is almost certainly an undercount.\nThe crisis can be seen in one nursing home after another from Massachusetts and Tennessee to West Virginia. In Iowa, nearly half of Covid-19 deaths have been in care homes. In Texas, nearly 80% of the residents of one San Antonio nursing home were diagnosed with Covid-19 along with eight staff members. The national guard helped evacuate a nursing home outside Nashville after about 100 people contracted the virus and four died.\nAt the Ambassador home in Detroit, carers worried they could carry the virus home to their families. If they fell sick, they wouldn\u2019t be able to work and most lived close to hand to mouth. Others were concerned that they were the ones carrying Covid-19 into the nursing home and endangering the very people they spent their days caring for.\nThrough it all, some staff said the management was not taking the threat seriously enough, resulting in at least eight confirmed infections and three deaths to date.\nIn a complaint against the Ambassador home to Detroit officials, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) included statements from nursing staff who said they spent weeks making repeated requests for masks, gowns and gloves to protect themselves and the people in their care.\nThe staff said equipment suddenly appeared hours before Detroit health officials arrived to inspect the home on Wednesday last week.\n\u201cApparently, Ambassador had been hoarding all of this equipment in their storage, but forcing us employees to work without it. This makes me angry! Why would they put our lives at risk, simply because they want to save a few bucks? Even still, we still don\u2019t have enough because we only have two masks and one of the other items,\u201d said one of the nursing assistants in a written submission to city officials.\nSeveral other carers at the home said the management refused to tell them when a patient tested positive for Covid-19 or was suspected of having the virus. Neither, they said, did the company limit exposure to those showing symptoms by putting them into isolation. Some continue to share rooms with other patients.\n\u201cFor those people testing positive, Ambassador should have made sure that people who interacted with those patients were warned that they have been exposed, and given some safety protocols. Otherwise, we will unknowingly take this virus to our homes and neighborhoods,\u201d a nursing assistant wrote in a complaint to the city.\nThe Ambassador is part owned and managed by Villa Healthcare which runs 34 nursing homes across the midwest. In response, the company accused critics of seeking \u201cto impugn our Villa Heroes based on the false allegations of biased parties\u201d, including the union.\nIt said the first confirmed case of coronavirus at the Ambassador home was not until 6 April and that since then a total of eight residents have tested positive, including four who are now in hospital.\nThe company denied that staff had been deprived of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment (PPE), saying that they were available to carers who asked for them. \u201cAt no time during this pandemic has Ambassador not had adequate PPE for the use and protection of its staff and residents,\u201d it said.\nThe company said that none of the deaths of residents since the Covid-19 outbreak had been shown to be attributable to the virus.\nBut workers at nursing homes across the country are making similar complaints. Dale Ewart, an SEIU official in Florida, said that even care homes trying to do the right thing struggle to find protective equipment.\n\u201cYou have this every man for himself situation where every healthcare company, every hospital, every state, is in this free market system where scammers and fraudsters and profiteers are charging five, six, seven, eight times the normal cost and nursing homes are always going to be losing out,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re engaged in a science experiment that\u2019s putting at risk the health of our entire population but first our healthcare workforce, and then the elderly and sick people that they take care of.\u201d\nEwart said that more than 70 staff in the 75 nursing homes where the union has members in Florida are now in quarantine, many without sick pay which he called \u201ca disgrace\u201d.\nMayors in Tennessee and Texas have even blamed care workers for exacerbating the danger by moving between jobs in different nursing homes or going to work despite showing Covid-19 symptoms. But care home staff are often paid minimum wage or close to it, and say they have had little choice but to carry on just to survive.\nThey also say that many nursing home owners refuse to pay sick leave without a confirmed coronavirus diagnosis. The nursing assistant who spoke to the Guardian said that she works at the Ambassador home and also for a second firm seeing individual patients.\n\u201cNursing staff are living in fear. Some of them are sick but they are pushing it because this is all that they have and they don\u2019t have the means to just to walk away. They\u2019re providing for their families \u2026 they don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d she said.\nIn other places, staff have stopped coming to work out of concern for their health. More than 80 patients, nearly half of them coronavirus positive, were evacuated from a Riverside, California, nursing home last week after most of the nursing assistants stayed away.\nEwart said falling numbers of carers to look after patients will become a growing problem.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t figure out a way to make workers feel like their basic health is being protected \u2026 then I would expect that they are going to be people who are going to ask themselves whether they really should be doing this,\u201d he said.\nNursing home owners blame low pay and poor working conditions on the economics of the industry. About 70% of long-term care homes in the US are run for profit. They rely on the Medicaid public health scheme paying for care for the bulk of their income. Nursing home owners complain that the reimbursements, which vary by state, barely cover costs. That, according to the industry trade group, the American Health Care Association, drives down staffing levels and pay, the availability of equipment and the quality of care.\nBut while the accounts of many nursing homes show slim profit margins, that obscures a widespread practice in the industry of bleeding income into the owners\u2019 pockets through management contracts and other fees.\nA Kaiser Health News investigation in 2017 found that nearly three-quarters of nursing homes use financial arrangements intended to suck profits out of the businesses and make it look like costs by paying fees to firms in which their owners have an interest or control. It said the arrangements ranged from renting premises owned by a sister corporation to contracting out basic functions such as management.\nThe Ambassador home is part-owned by the Olympia Group which is in turn is part-owned by Villa Healthcare. Ambassador said it pays Villa for \u201cconsulting services\u201d including providing staff.\nEwart said the industry used the claim of lack of money to weaken regulations on staffing levels in Florida, further endangering patients. The American Health Care Association has pressed the Trump administration to reduce \u201cextremely burdensome\u201d regulation including an Obama-era requirement for increased measures to prevent infections, a recurring problem in nursing homes.\nThe risk of contracting Covid-19 in care homes is now so great that in California, the public health director for Los Angeles county advised families to take their loved ones out of them. But many residents don\u2019t have anywhere to go or anyone to look after them.\n\u201cMost of them, we are the only family that they have,\u201d said the nursing assistant. \u201cThey depend on us. They look forward to seeing us. They don\u2019t have access to talk to the people in the outside world. We\u2019re all that they have.\u201d",

By Monday, it had more than doubled that, hitting a new record of 2.4 exaflops, faster than the top 500 traditional supercomputers combined, thanks to almost 1 million new members of the network.\nThe breakthrough reflects a huge spike in support for the Folding@Home project. Backers run a simple piece of software on their home computer, which then downloads and performs small tasks to help determine the physical structure of proteins.\nAll complex proteins are made of one or more strings of amino acids, folded in on themselves in complex \u2013 but predictable \u2013 ways to make 3D shapes. By applying those predictable rules, even a home computer can carry out folding calculations, and when millions of home computers are running the software at the same time, the total network can far outpace traditional supercomputers.\nIn March, Folding@Home announced a new set of tasks related to Covid-19 that would put contributors to work simulating the dynamics of the proteins that make up Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) to hunt for new prospects for drugs to tackle the disease.\nIt is already paying off. One effort has been focusing on the \u201cspike\u201d protein that Sars-CoV-2 uses to invade human cells, says Greg Bowman, one of the researchers coordinating the effort. \u201cIt is well established that the spike must undergo a dramatic opening motion to reveal the interface that ultimately binds a human cell. Understanding how the spike opens up \u2026 could be extremely useful. Every step along the way could potentially be targeted with therapeutics.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there is no way to watch a spike undergo this transition, at least with existing experimental techniques. Data on what the open state even looks like is also limited.\u201d But after just a few weeks of project time, the team was able to create a simulation that showed the first stage of the \u201cmouth\u201d opening up.\nThose successes have taken the project far beyond its previous peak in 2007, when Sony built support for Folding@Home into its PlayStation 3 consoles, increasing the amount of processing power available at a stroke.\nSince then, interest has waxed and waned. Folding@Home and similar projects were hurt by the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which offered another, less altruistic, use for \u201cspare\u201d processing power: \u201cmining\u201d for coins that could make real money. But the project also saw a boost in early March, just days before it announced its new Covid-19 focus, when SETI@home, the pioneer distributed computing effort, shut down.\nSETI@home had been sending radio telescope data to computers around the world since 1999, which would then be analysed for signs of extraterrestrial life. But last month, the researchers behind it closed the program, saying they had analysed \u201call the data we need\u201d for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work for us to manage the distributed processing of data,\u201d SETI@home\u2019s organisers said. \u201cWe need to focus on completing the back-end analysis of the results we already have, and writing this up in a scientific journal paper.\u201d",

The man, referred to as AQS in the judgment issued last week, was evicted last month for property damage after he became angry with the situation. After sleeping rough, he was taken in by a friend who subsequently developed \u201csymptoms of a high fever\u201d.\nA witness statement from Refugee Action\u2019s London asylum service manager in another legal case this month said people were being deterred \u201cfrom applying for asylum support for fear that they will have to share a room and put themselves at risk should they contract Covid-19\u201d.\nAn asylum seeker in a south London hostel said that since the lockdown two strangers had shared the only double bed in his room for a week.\nHe said there had been four people in the room \u2013 a video seen by the Guardian shows three beds a few inches apart \u2013 but two of them left last week and a new person moved in.\nSimon (not his real name) said: \u201cThey tell you to sleep in the double bed with other people. Every three or four days new people come in. I am very scared. You are not in a safe place.\u201d\nThe man, who has latent tuberculosis, said another occupant of the hostel had been taken to hospital with coronavirus symptoms.\nA woman in different temporary asylum accommodation in London described her fear about sharing a double room with three strangers. Mary (not her real name), who is HIV positive, said people had regularly arrived at the hostel since the lockdown began.\n\u201cLast night there was someone sneezing and there is a lot of tension in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cI have flu [symptoms]. I am feeling scared.\u201d\nThe judgment in the case of AQS shows his eviction came after another man was moved into his shared room who had \u201ca persistent cough and night sweats\u201d. The man left the next day but AQS developed \u201csymptoms of a high fever and a persistent cough\u201d.\nAlthough AQS, who has mental health problems, was offered a single room, he became angry and was kicked out after an incident with the manager. Following judicial review, he was rehoused in \u201ca facility operated specifically for those entitled to asylum accommodation with symptoms of Covid-19\u201d.\nThe migration lawyer Simon Cox of Doughty Street Chambers, who represented AQS, said as far as he was aware this accommodation in London was the only dedicated housing for symptomatic asylum seekers in the UK.\nHe said: \u201cAnother of my homeless clients was asked to share a room with five other men on Friday [3 April]. The Home Office should be urgently sourcing extra accommodation, not crowding people into existing rooms. That\u2019s a recipe for transmission.\u201d\nStephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said it was impossible for many asylum seekers to practise physical distancing and self-isolation. He added: \u201cOvercrowding in poor accommodation and delays in providing even paltry levels of support have always been rife but now these problems are putting lives at risk.\u201d\nSabir Zazai, the chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, said it was hearing daily from asylum seekers in Glasgow fearful of sharing accommodation with strangers.\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: \u201cAsylum accommodation providers are following public health guidance and are providing additional accommodation for individuals with symptoms who need to self-isolate.\u201d",

The two halves don\u2019t add up to anything like a satisfying movie; somehow The Host manages to be both ridiculous and dull. Awkward performances don\u2019t help: it\u2019s as if the actors are clapping eyes on each other for the first time, having had five minutes to give the script the once over in a broom cupboard.\nMike Beckingham plays Robert, a cashier at a bank for the filthy rich, who becomes the victim of two far-fetched criminal conspiracies in one weekend, poor chump. His problems begin when he steals \u00a350,000 from a safety deposit box at work and blows the lot on a single poker game at an illegal gambling den owned by triads. Actually, the entire match is a set-up job concocted by triad boss Lau (Togo Igawa) to blackmail Robert into carrying a briefcase of cash to Amsterdam as part of a heroin deal. Director Andy Newbery and his scriptwriters are not exactly making an effort here to dispel stereotypes with their portrayal of Lau, who disguises his menace behind a veneer of Zen-like calm, or his crew of thick-necked thugs.\nIn Amsterdam, Robert\u2019s luck appears to be looking up when he arrives at his palatial Airbnb, owned by gorgeous and single socialite Vera (Maryam Hassouni). Alas, she turns out to be a female Norman Bates, and what she does to Robert in her dungeon \u2013 kitted out with a surgical table and all manner of agony-inflicting goodies \u2013 has him crying out for the less creative punishments of the triads. Newbery doesn\u2019t go full-on yuck with the gore. Still, his film is a nightmare for all the wrong reasons.\nThe Host is released on 17 April on digital platforms.",

Professional sports across America, and the world, have been shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic, and Trump said he was bored of watching repeats.\n\u201cWe have to get our sports back. I\u2019m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t actually had too much time to watch.

I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.\" pic.twitter.com/FSUKLHI5U0\nDr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s prominent public health adviser, said sports could only reopen if fans are excluded and players put under strict quarantine. \u201cThere\u2019s a way of doing that,\u201d Fauci told Snapchat\u2019s Peter Hamby. \u201cNobody comes to the stadium. Put [the athletes] in big hotels, wherever you want to play, keep them pretty well surveilled ... have them tested every single week and make sure they don\u2019t wind up infecting each other or their family and just let them play the season out.\u201d\nMeanwhile New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, gave a cautious response when he was asked about reopening sports.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an on-off switch [reopening] and we should get it right, one false move and we will see a resurgence , that\u2019s the worst of all scenarios, so let\u2019s get this right ... it will be about smart, careful, staged reopening. If you put 50,000 people in Yankee stadium and see a resurgence [of Covid-19] that would be the worst thing. We have one chance to contain this thing,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday morning. More than 10,000 people have died in New York City during the pandemic.\nTrump has repeatedly spoken of his desire to get the US to reopen for business as soon as possible, as the Covid-19 shutdown takes a massive toll on the economy. As part of that drive, Trump has assembled a team of advisers from the sports world. They include the commissioners of the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, MLS, PGA and LPGA as well as Robert Kraft, Jerry Jones and Mark Cuban, the owners of the New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys and Dallas Mavericks respectively.\nTrump singled out two men on the panel for special praise, calling UFC president Dana White and WWE chairman Vince McMahon \u201cgreat\u201d. Both men are long-term allies of the president and White spoke at a campaign rally for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nBoth White and McMahon have made steps towards resuming their sports. White told ESPN on Tuesday he wants to put on a fight card on 9 May, while WWE has resumed live broadcasts in Florida after the state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, ruled professional wrestling is an \u201cessential service\u201d alongside hospitals, fire departments and law enforcement. A spokesperson for DeSantis, an ally of Trump, said WWE is \u201ccritical\u201d to Florida\u2019s economy.\nThere have also been reports baseball could start its season in May with players under strict quarantine and all games played in Arizona.

He added with a laugh, however, in an interview with the Associated Press: \u201cOne can\u2019t predict the future.\u201d\nSanders suspended his presidential campaign last week, setting the stage for a November general election battle between two candidates, Trump and Biden, with radically different visions of presidential leadership and America\u2019s role in the world. The contest will unfold in a political landscape transformed beyond all recognition by the coronavirus pandemic that has already claimed at least 14,000 American lives and nearly 10m jobs.\nOn Tuesday night, Sanders criticized his own supporters who have so far resisted his vow to do whatever it takes to help Biden win the presidency.\nHe seemed to distance himself from his campaign\u2019s former national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, when asked about her recent statement on social media refusing to endorse Biden.\n\u201cShe is my former press secretary \u2013 not on the payroll,\u201d Sanders noted. A spokesman later clarified that all campaign staffers were no longer on the payroll as of Tuesday, though they will get a severance check in May.\nSanders said his supporters have a simple choice now that Biden has emerged as the presumptive nominee: \u201cDo we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive direction? Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president in modern American history to get re-elected?\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cI believe that it\u2019s irresponsible for anybody to say, \u2018Well, I disagree with Joe Biden\u2019 \u2013 I disagree with Joe Biden! \u2013 \u2018and therefore I\u2019m not going to be involved.\u2019\u201d\nSanders said he would not actively campaign or spend money on advertising in the primary contests that are still on the calendar in the coming months. But he still encouraged Democrats in those states to vote for him, hoping to amass as many delegates as possible for leverage to shape the party platform and the direction of Biden\u2019s campaign.\nHe also vowed to continue fighting for progressive priorities such as his signature \u201cMedicare for All\u201d as a senator, even though Biden has refused to embrace the government-backed single-payer healthcare system.\n\u201cIf people want to vote for me, we\u2019d appreciate it,\u201d Sanders said of the roughly 20 primary contests that remain where his name will appear on the ballot. He later added, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign into a more progressive direction on a whole lot of issues.\u201d\nUpon gaining his endorsement on Monday, Biden said: \u201cYou\u2019ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America. You don\u2019t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cIf I am the nominee \u2013 which it looks like now you just made me \u2013 I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern.\u201d Biden has previously said of Sanders\u2019 most fervent supporters \u201cI hear you.\u201d But some progressives are concerned that he is paying lip service more than shifting to the left in his platform.\nSanders did not outline any specific plans to begin helping Biden in earnest, though he noted that he held dozens of rallies for former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton four years ago and would be at least as active for Biden.\nIn the short term, he said he\u2019s essentially \u201cincarcerated in his home\u201d because of coronavirus social distancing guidelines and did not know when he would return to the campaign trail.\n\u201cI will do everything I can to help elect Joe,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cWe had a contentious campaign. We disagree on issues. But my job now is to not only rally my supporters, but to do everything I can to bring the party together to see that [Trump] is not elected president.\u201d",

The Royal Shakespeare Company is not expecting that from the public but instead, how about teaching your dog to bark the word Macbeth?\nOr recreate the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene with vegetables. Shout some Hamlet over the garden fence to your neighbour. If you\u2019ve got flour, bake a Shakespeare-themed cake.\nThe RSC has announced that because it cannot celebrate Shakespeare\u2019s birthday on 23 April with physical events in Stratford-upon-Avon, it will do it virtually.\nIn partnership with the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC, it has launched a worldwide initiative, #ShareYourShakespeare, encouraging people to think laterally to celebrate the Bard.\nThe project is supported by David Tennant, who recruited fellow actors including Jane Lapotaire, Paapa Essiedu and David Threlfall for a film of them delivering the monologue \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage\u201d, from As You Like It.\nGregory Doran, the RSC\u2019s artistic director, said that with productions cancelled and buildings closed, \u201cit feels more important than ever to connect with our audiences, artists and partners across the world through shared experiences\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cTogether we can celebrate those everyday acts of human creativity and resilience that continue to inspire us, raise a smile and propel us forward, together in times of crisis.\u201d\nThe idea is that people everywhere film or photograph something Shakespeare-related and upload it to Twitter, Instagram or YouTube tagging @theRSC and using the hashtag #ShareYourShakespeare. Or they can email or post.\nOrganisers have offered a few ideas that also include: perform \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage\u201d with your family; paint your favourite scene; tell a Shakespeare story using only emojis; rewrite a speech as a song. Or even teach your dog to bark some Shakespeare.\n\u201cI\u2019d love someone to do that, wouldn\u2019t that be brilliant,\u201d said Kerry Radden, the head of audiences at the RSC. \u201cWhen we were reaching out for ideas the first two people who came back, one said: \u2018I\u2019m going to read a sonnet to my cat,\u2019 the other said: \u2018I\u2019m going to read a sonnet to my new puppy.\u2019\n\u201cWe are expecting the animal community to take part.\u201d\nThe idea is to create a huge montage of the most surprising and creative ideas that will, on 23 April, be \u201cthe biggest ever digital birthday card to Shakespeare\u201d.\nRadden said the idea was to bring people together. \u201cInstead of being the Royal Shakespeare Company, we want to become the Royal Shakespeare Community and embrace people\u2019s creativity while they are stuck at home.\n\u201cShakespeare gets into all nooks and crannies of our lives and we would love to get lots of wacky, creative ideas. It is whatever Shakespeare means to you, whether that is kids dressed up performing Macbeth in the garden or baking a cake with a quote on top.\n\u201cWe want it to be a happy, joyful thing which brings people together. Fun not worthy.\u201d\nMichael Witmore, the director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, said it did not matter how polished the endeavours were.\n\u201cWe just want to show what ordinary creative people \u2013 which means all people \u2013 can do when we put our minds and hearts together in a time of crisis. Just because we are sheltering in place doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t create in place too.\u201d",

Coronavirus is a global challenge and it\u2019s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat.\u201d\nAsked if this meant No 10 was disappointed by the president\u2019s move, the spokesman said: \u201cI can only set out the UK\u2019s position and that is we have no plans to stop funding the WHO.\u201d\nSpeaking earlier to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Javid, who resigned as chancellor in February, said that while he did not endorse Trump\u2019s actions over the WHO \u2013 \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he said \u2013 there was a need to consider China\u2019s role in the outbreak.\n\u201cI think one of the lessons to learn from this, when we are past the worst of the crisis, is that we are going to have to look carefully into \u2026 was China providing the right information to us, and to the WHO, and to others,\u201d he said.\n\u201cChina, for example, didn\u2019t even admit to human-to-human transmission until some time in January, which was very late in the day. I think it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask, what they knew, when, and how that could have made a difference.\u201d\nAlso speaking to Today, Sawers, who was also the UK representative to the UN, said there was \u201cdeep anger in America at what they see as having been inflicted on us all by China\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cChina is evading a good deal of responsibility for the origin of the virus, for failing to deal with it initially. At the same time we can\u2019t find a way out of this without working with China. So it\u2019s going to be a complex set of issues we\u2019re going to have to work with, and the world will not be the same after the virus as it was before.\u201d\nMinisters are understood to be keeping an open mind over the Chinese government\u2019s actions at the start of the pandemic, and Downing Street has repeatedly called for \u201ctransparency\u201d from all countries facing the virus, a clear nod towards the fact that Beijing has been far from open about both the origin of coronavirus and its spread in the country.\nHowever, there is a keenness to avoid any tensions that could jeopardise international cooperation over efforts to tackle the pandemic, with an emphasis on pragmatic politics for now.\nA government source said: \u201cWe have one overriding focus now, which is getting a grip of the crisis and defeating the virus. Even if they hold very strong views on what might or might not have happened, the people who are calling for action have to explain: why now, and what will it achieve?\u201d",

        "content": "Critics say banks are failing to meet demand despite doubling number of loans in one week\nOnly one in five UK businesses who have formally applied for government-backed loans have been granted emergency funding during the Covid-19 lockdown, raising concerns that the programme is failing to get money out fast enough to support struggling firms.\nFigures released by the banking lobby group UK Finance showed that British banks have nearly doubled the number of business loans for customers impacted by the Covid-19 lockdown in just one week, but critics say the government-backed scheme is still failing get money out fast enough to support struggling firms.\nA total of 6,020 loans worth \u00a31.1bn had been issued under the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) as of Tuesday. That is nearly twice the 3,309 issued last week, and marks a 150% rise in the total amount lent to small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 worth an additional \u00a3700m.\nUK Finance said 21% of the 28,460 formal applications had so far been approved for the government-backed loans, which are interest-free for 12 months. However, more than 300,000 firms have reportedly made informal inquiries about seeking help from the scheme, which is part of the government\u2019s wider business support package worth \u00a3330bn.\nA survey released on Wednesday by the British Chambers of Commerce showed that just 2% of respondents had successfully accessed the CBILS programme this week. While that is double last week\u2019s figure, some businesses said lenders were failing to respond to informal inquiries fast enough, if at all. UK Finance is not releasing data showing which banks are releasing the most loans under the scheme. More than 40 lenders are issuing CBILS loans.\nMike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said: \u201cThis improvement marks a starting point, but while one in five formal CBILS applications are approved, the major banks claim their approval rates for standard commercial loans are many times higher than that. These loans are state-backed, so approvals should be higher still. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u201d\nThe UK Finance chief executive, Stephen Jones, said banks were trying their best to keep up with demand: \u201cFrontline staff in local branches and call centres are working incredibly hard to help firms access finance as quickly as possible amid unprecedented demand. Like all businesses they are working at reduced capacity as many staff are self-isolating or looking after family.\u201d\nThe Treasury has had to change its criteria to get money out more quickly to businesses which may otherwise fail to survive the lockdown. It has banned personal guarantees that put business owners\u2019 property at risk, and scrapped a controversial requirement for banks to offer loans at commercial interest rates \u2013 reportedly as high as 12% \u2013 to any eligible businesses before offering a CBILS application.\nHowever, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said the CBILS programme should be expanded so the UK government guarantee covers the entire loan and therefore bolsters banks\u2019 appetite to lend. Under the current terms, the government covers 80% of a CBILS loan.\n\u201cThese figures show that the CBIL scheme is simply not working well enough. We need change now. The chancellor must move to a 100% guarantee of loans for smaller businesses as other countries have done. In this economic emergency, it is the right thing to do,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cIn the coming days, businesses are facing critical decisions about their future.\u201d\nCherry said there was also concern about the future of Britain\u2019s loss-making startups, which were not eligible for CBILS but should not be allowed to fail.\n\u201cThe question of support for early stage, loss making start-ups remains a pressing one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe list of businesses that spent their early years in the red only to go on and be great successes is as long as your arm. They must not be abandoned.\u201d\nNeil Massey, shave shop owner\nNeil Massey, 56, runs Mr Massey\u2019s Emporium, which specialises in handmade facial hair and skincare products in Brighton.\nMassey has not received any wholesale orders since the lockdown was enforced and, with the high street shop also shut, he has had to rely solely on online sales for income.\nHe approached Santander for a CBILS loan on 17 March when the chancellor expanded the scheme but has so far failed to access emergency funding. \u201cWe applied for a business interruption loan on the day it was launched. Three weeks later, and after several calls and emails to Santander and our MP, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, we still have no funding,\u201d Massey said.\n\u201cThe bank has sent two updates to say they are inundated, but a friend who works at a senior level at the bank says they are not willing to lend to businesses which are struggling in a time of such uncertainty, even with government backing.\u201d\nHe has since made a formal complaint to the bank.\nGraham Constantine, marketing agency boss\nGraham Constantine, 59, who runs a three-person digital marketing agency on the south coast, has suffered a 50% drop in client contracts since the coronavirus outbreak.\nAfter hearing about the government-backed CBILS programme three weeks ago, he has made at least five calls to Barclays, tried to contact the lender online, and requested two callbacks by the British Business Bank, which is in charge of administering the CBILS programme.\nHe eventually visited his local branch in Brighton: \u201cI was told by the five people standing around in the foyer that they were not authorised to help.\nConstantine has since abandoned the idea of CBILS assistance, as few banks besides RBS are offering loans worth less than \u00a325,000, which is too large for his business.\nHe is now chasing Barclays for an emergency overdraft. While the bank has called back twice, neither of the agents were authorised to deal with Constantine\u2019s request and told him they would be in touch soon.\n\u201cLike all small-business owners I am very resilient and will trade my way through it. But I know that the cavalry are not coming.\u201d",

We will also continue to work with all stakeholders and provide the necessary clarifications as we have done since the beginning of this unprecedented crisis.\u201d\nThe bulk of the criticism of the firm, in the case, was levied at its health and safety failingsThe judges said it had \u201cevidently failed to comply with obligations to protect the health of employees\u201d.\nThe company has come under criticism worldwide for its failings, and on Tuesday admitted that one of its employees had died of Covid-19 in late March.\nDozens of Amazon warehouses have experienced clusters of infections. One, on Staten Island in New York, had at least 14 positive tests, and workers said the true figure was far higher.\nThe outbreaks have caused internal dissent, which Amazon has so far responded to harshly: three employees who were at the centre of internal protests have been fired, though the company denies a connection between their complaints and terminations.\nAmazon temporarily, in late March, stopped taking orders for some non-essential products in France and Italy, in a move to implement social distancing guidelines at the company\u2019s dispatch centres in those countries. Now the company says it is \u201cprioritising\u201d essential products in those countries, but non-essentials continue to be available.\nA few days before the French limits, Amazon told third-party sellers in the US that it would not let them stock non-essential items in its warehouses. The company provides a service, Fulfilled by Amazon, which entails handling shipping for independent companies, but on 18 March it limited that to only essential items sold by those firms. Last week, an investigation by the newsroom The Markup revealed that some items stretched the definition: \u201cYou could still order a bowling ball, a 10-pack of rubber chickens and a prom dress, and have them show up at your door within a week.\u201d On Monday, Amazon lifted the non-essential ban.\nAmazon has not implemented an absolute ban on non-essentials in the UK but has said it will prioritise essential items. In practice, that means that Amazon Prime customers, who pay an annual fee for next-day delivery, now have to wait up to a week for items such as novelty bottle openers or garden shovels; most items through the store can be delivered by Monday if bought before the end of the previous Wednesday. The company\u2019s dry food delivery service, Pantry, continues to offer next-day shipping, while its online supermarket, Fresh, has limited delivery slots.",

It also said VAT was still being applied to PPE bought by care homes because of EU procurement rules.\nBut some hospitals have already begun cleaning single-use gowns to preserve stocks, according to separate emails seen by the BBC.\nIt is understood that the chief medical officers and chief nurses of the four UK nations recently discussed the issue.\nFollowing the meeting, a draft document written by PHE and dated 13 April suggested solutions for \u201cacute supply shortages\u201d of PPE.\n\u201cThese are last-resort alternatives, but, given the current in-country stock and the reduced ability to resupply, we are suggesting that these are implemented until confirmation of adequate resupply is in place,\u201d it said.\nThe plans suggested a series of \u201clast-resort arrangements\u201d, including buying \u201cbuilding\u201d or \u201csportswear\u201d eye protection with extensions to cover the side of the eyes if there were no available goggles or face shields, and using washable laboratory coats and patient gowns when there were no available disposable gowns or coveralls.\nIt also suggests repurposing face masks using various disinfection or sterilisation methods, including steam and UV disinfection.\nThe document said some of the last-resort measures would need to be reviewed and approved by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).\nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of vaporised hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate certain masks and respirators for use by staff.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA), told the BBC: \u201cThis underlines the urgency with which we need this situation sorted.\n\u201cThe government must be honest about PPE supplies.

Temporary Distortion, the producer of this show \u2013 performed in New York in 2009 and now available online \u2013 has long combined artistic forms and brought film and installation together on stage.\nCo-created by William Cusick and Kenneth Collins (the latter also wrote and directed), the production involves actors speaking from inside lifesize shadow boxes at either end of the stage while an accompanying film plays on a screen. The boxes create a claustrophobic effect between the characters, who play out the tensions and paranoias of a relationship ending in violence and demonic revenge. Their dialogue has an intensity that is strange at first but becomes magnetic.\nFilm noir tropes combine with those from Japanese horror and the story is told elliptically. Impressionistic sequences on screen blend with John Sully\u2019s jagged soundtrack and reality seemingly coalesces with fantasy, taking on the pace and strangeness of a dream.\nThis unpinning of normal life chimes with the drama\u2019s greater theme of the distances or dishonesties within relationships. \u201cI know where you go at night,\u201d says an unnamed female character (Yuki Kawahisa) to her partner (Ryosuke Yamada). \u201cI never go anywhere,\u201d he replies, \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head. It\u2019s a dream.\u201d\nBecause of the jumps in time and place, the plotline is at times opaque. The central story revolves around a single couple, an infidelity and a murder, but it is not always clear which of the four actors is playing whom, and Japanese is mingled with English without always being translated for added disorientation.\nThere are some gimmicky edges to the piece\u2019s creepiness and several over-familiar horror ideas are rolled out: a screeching phone that remains unanswered, a film of an empty hotel corridor that looks like a shot from The Shining, a long-haired succubus who moves towards the screen, her mouth opening as if to swallow it, like the avenging figure from Ring.\nThe problematic gender politics of traditional film noir are there, too: the quietly murderous men, the eroticised violence against women, (\u201cSome men, they enjoy a girl\u2019s body all black and blue,\u201d says Brian Greer\u2019s character), and the mix of love, lust and jealousy that inevitably leads to the torture or death of a woman.\nBut strangely, Americana Kamikaze feels both chilling and original nonetheless, possibly because these stock-in-trade aspects feel reinvented in this theatrical arrangement. In the few instances when bloody violence erupts, it startles, but more often the horror is intimated, and there is potency in its constantly buzzing threat.\nAmericana Kamikaze is available online",

She described how she had panic attacks before police coerced her into signing a confession that she had fabricated the assault.\n\u201cThere was no other way out of that police station other than [to] sign that retraction statement,\u201d the woman, who remains anonymous and was referred to as Emily in the programme, said.\nWithin hours of her revoking the accusation the alleged assailants were allowed to fly home. Overnight, the woman, 19, who was subsequently diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder, was turned from victim to suspect. She spent more than four weeks in Nicosia general prison, and on her release had to remain on the island for court proceedings that would drag on for the next five months.\nIn January, a judge sitting in Paralimni, the nearest town to the party resort, found her guilty of fabricating the rape claim and sentenced her to four months in prison, suspended for three years, for the crime of fomenting public mischief.\nWith the ITV documentary again putting the case in the news, Greek Cypriot police rebutted suggestions of improper conduct, saying all the officers involved had not only followed the right procedures but had been exonerated in court.\n\u201cThe court ruled that there was nothing wrong in the way the officers acted,\u201d the force\u2019s spokesman, Christos Andreou, told the Guardian in Nicosia, the capital. \u201cThe court said that, not the police, and so there is nothing more to say.\u201d\nThe Briton is trying to clear her name by taking her case to Cyprus\u2019s supreme court, but her case is expected to be substantially delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nHer lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, who is overseeing the appeal said: \u201cThe court had instructed us to submit skeleton arguments but everything has now been suspended. A new date has not been set.\u201d\nThe Derbyshire student has vowed to go all the way to the European court of human rights, if need be, with activists saying the case has highlighted the problem of rape \u2013 and women frequently not being believed by authorities when they report it \u2013 and the trauma associated with sexual assault.\nZelia Gregoriou, who teaches gender politics at the University of Cyprus, said. \u201cWe will all be there supporting her again.

Bans on mass gatherings like festivals and concerts should be among the last to be lifted.\nThe commission also said it could be a year before a vaccine was widely available and urged a massive increase in testing, performed in the same way across the bloc. Data collection, including through apps on mobile phones, could reduce the risk of further transmission but should be voluntary, it said.\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, the coronavirus has infected nearly 2,000,100 people and killed 128,000 around the globe. More than one third of humanity is living under some form of lockdown restrictions.\nIn countries where the outbreak has passed or is near its peak, leaders are wrestling with difficult decisions over lifting containment measures to jump-start economies and avert crippling recession, while still avoiding a second wave of infections.\nItaly has allowed bookshops, laundries, stationers and children\u2019s clothing stores to re-open on Tuesday - although many decided to stay shut - while Spain allowed work to restart in some factories and construction sites, and Denmark reopened its schools.\nBill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, now firmly established as the heart of the global crisis after revising its death toll sharply upwards to more than 10,000 people, also urged a cautious and deliberative approach to reviving the economy, warning that moving too quickly could create an opportunity for the coronavirus to resurface.\n\u201cWe cannot allow that,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cWe get one chance to get it right. I think we have to be smart about doing it in stages, making sure that we can confirm that we\u2019re containing the disease more and more, getting it back to where it was a month or two ago, before we start to open up a lot.\u201d\nElsewhere, people braced for several more weeks of restrictions. Japan on Wednesday urged its citizens to stay at home as media cited an unpublished health ministry projection suggesting as many as 400,000 could die without mitigation and 850,000 could end up needing ventilators.\nJapan has so far recorded more than 9,000 infections amid an accelerating infection rate in recent weeks, particularly in Tokyo. The government has declared an emergency in Tokyo and six other areas including Osaka, and a goal to cut interactions between people by 70% \u2013 although there are no fines or penalties.\nMeanwhile the virus is slowly taking hold in Africa, with 15,000 cases and 800 deaths continent-wide as fears mount over growing hunger and possible social unrest. \u201cA lockdown is unenforceable and unsustainable across much of Africa,\u201d said Jakkie Cilliers of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in Pretoria, South Africa.\n\u201cYou are trying to do something that is not possible, and you are condemning people to a choice between starving and getting sick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for 10 people living in a tin shack... to not go outside for three weeks.\u201d\nIn South Korea, meanwhile, more than 17 million people wore masks and disposable gloves to vote in parliamentary elections \u2013 the highest turnout in nearly three decades despite the coronavirus, with another 11.8 million casting their ballots early.\nSouth Korea has been widely praised for its success in using mass testing and contact tracing to contain the spread of the virus, and to hold the elections as scheduled, officials and health authorities carefully prepared safeguards to reduce the risk.\nIn the US, which on Tuesday counted a record of 2,228 victims over the past 24 hours, Donald Trump sparked global outrage by announcing that Washington would halt payments to the WHO amounting to about $400m last year.",

        "content": "The standoff between Arsenal and their players over wage reductions risks sending an untimely ripple through waters that, after a turbulent first half of the season, seemed to have calmed since Mikel Arteta\u2019s arrival in December.\nArsenal want their players to take a pay cut of 12.5%, which would apply if they did not qualify for the Champions League when football restarts, but that suggestion has been rejected by a significant number of the squad.\nTalks are continuing and Arsenal were conciliatory in their summary of the situation presented to supporters via the club website on Wednesday.\n\u201cOver the past 10 days we have been in discussions with [the players] around the potential financial challenges ahead and how we are planning for those now,\u201d it read. \u201cThese are productive and ongoing conversations about how our players might support their club in an appropriate way.\u201d\nA faint undertone could be detected, because the definitions of \u201cappropriate\u201d differ. The suspicion remains that everyone will eventually meet halfway.\nThe players\u2019 position is that only a deferral will do and, while the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association representative, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, is the conduit for negotiations with the club, the soundings being taken generally cement this stance.\nOne agent with high-profile representation in the Arsenal first team said his position is simple: the solution has to be a deferral and, furthermore, one without caveats relating to the Champions League. Another with interest in the negotiations has the same view, saying anything other than a request for deferral with a fixed reimbursement date for the full amount should simply not be deemed acceptable from a club in the Premier League.\nUsing a player\u2019s agreed salary as \u2013 in effect \u2013 a bonus contingent on Champions League qualification was, he suggested, not an honest way to proceed, particularly given Arsenal\u2019s chances of returning to that stage for the first time in four seasons remain slim.\nThere is clearly some way to go before the situation mirrors that at Brighton, a considerable distance down the top-flight food chain, where Glenn Murray said talks about wage reduction details were \u201cbringing the club together even more\u201d.\nArsenal have a wage bill of around \u00a3230m, a huge figure to sustain when European football of any kind may be off the table next season, and there is an urgency to mitigate a state of affairs that \u201cputs our operating model under pressure\u201d.\nThere remains a sense in some with links to the squad that footballers who already make plenty of charitable contributions should not be taking the hit for billionaire owners.\nOne of the representatives pointed out Arsenal\u2019s academy has produced several players with first-team experience who are not yet regulars and could fetch eight-figure sums if agreements are formed now for when the transfer market grinds back into gear. That could make up a big chunk of the Covid-19 shortfall. It is an approach that has raised plenty of money before but the club see the potential for greater certainty in their current proposal.\nThe announcement on Wednesday that Arsenal\u2019s executive team \u2013 comprising the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, the head of football, Raul Sanllehi, the technical director, Edu and 11 others \u2013 will waive more than a third of their earnings over the next year would appear to place the ball firmly in the players\u2019 court. All the executive team are well remunerated but none earn close to a top-end Premier League salary.\nThe club also made it clear they are \u201cnot currently intending\u201d to furlough staff and nor are they considering redundancies.\nThere is no desire from any party to be caught up in a public relations battle, although the emergence over the weekend of details about such tightly guarded discussions may not have aided the players on that front, given recent sensitivities about footballers\u2019 responses to the crisis and the agreements publicly made at \u2013 for example \u2013 several Bundesliga clubs.\nIn any case, it is hard to tell where the balance of power lies. Arsenal do not want to risk alienating certain players to the extent that contract negotiations, which already look more challenging than ever, are compromised further.\nPlenty of time had been spent trying to persuade Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to entertain the possibility of an extended stay before the Covid-19 shutdown, while the club already knew they might not have it all their own way in securing Bukayo Saka \u2013 one of the Premier League season\u2019s revelations \u2013 with Europe\u2019s giants paying attention.\nFirst of all, though, an amicable way out of the deadlock is required if Arsenal\u2019s prospects are not to look even more blurred.",

Others say they cannot afford to pay because they have lost jobs vital to fund their living costs during their studies.\nAmong those caught up in the lockdown are international students from countries across the globe, including China, Japan, Pakistan, India and the US, who are stranded thousands of miles away from their families.\n\u201cWe are stuck between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Jamsheed Cooper, a 27-year-old masters student, who is stranded in his \u00a3650-a-month student accommodation on the Sussex University campus, unable to get home to Dubai. He is one of about 150 supporting the rent strike at Sussex.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to withhold my rent. We can\u2019t leave even if we wanted to. Almost all the campus services are absolutely closed. What are we paying for? The cleaners are not even coming. It\u2019s a ghost town right now.\u201d\nAlso stuck in the East Slope accommodation block at Sussex and withholding his rent is George Grammer-Taylor, 23, a first-year law undergraduate, who lost his job in a seafront bar and is now relying on savings to survive.\n\u201cI\u2019m refusing to pay because it almost feels like forced imprisonment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. There\u2019s just nothing on campus. It\u2019s desolate. A lot of people are struggling. I just feel there\u2019s no support for students when this should be the time when the university is supporting us the most. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d\nA University of Sussex spokesperson said students were told in March that rental payments for the final term would not apply for those who were no longer living on campus, costing the institution more than than \u00a35m in lost rent.\nWhile many students were able to get out, others found themselves caught by the lockdown restrictions after the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, wrote to them urging them to stay put and not attempt to travel.\nWhile all teaching has moved online at Sussex, around a fifth of student residents have stayed on campus. \u201cProviding these students with the many services required to enable them to live on campus and support their welfare at this very difficult time has, and will continue to be, our overwhelming priority,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe university said reception and security services were available 24/7, as well as catering, a supermarket, wellbeing services and regular cleaning and maintenance: \u201cWe do appreciate this is an extremely unsettling time for our students on campus and we wish their time at Sussex could be different. We hope that our students know we will continue to do everything we can to respond to their needs.\u201d\nElsewhere, students living in privately owned accommodation are finding themselves tied into tenancy agreements costing thousands of pounds, even though many have travelled home to be with their families during the Covid-19 crisis.\nStudents at the University of Warwick have also started a rent strike. While the university has waived rent and cancelled contracts for students renting on campus, many of those renting off-campus from private landlords are still obliged to pay, though many of the rentals will have been arranged via the university\u2019s property management agency. A Facebook group in support of the strike has gathered more than 650 members.\nSecond-year management student Alfie Brepotra told the student newspaper, the Boar: \u201cStudent tenants are already in a precarious position where it is easy for landlords to manipulate us and this crisis only highlights that, especially for working-class students and those who rely on part-time work who are now temporarily unemployed.\u201d\nA Warwick University spokesperson responded: \u201cOff-campus renting during the current situation continues to present complex challenges to everyone concerned.\n\u201cOur principal and immediate focus is on student hardship, ensuring that students with real financial support needs can access the support they need through the university\u2019s students hardship scheme, rather than taking any other action that could lead them into potentially costly, and lengthy, legal disputes, particularly with private sector landlords.\u201d",

        "content": "Health secretary says people can visit those with Covid-19, but care sector warns of lack of PPE\nMatt Hancock has announced new proposals to allow people to be with relatives in care homes who are gravely ill with coronavirus before they die, so that they can fulfil their \u201cright to say goodbye\u201d.\nBut the care sector responded with caution to the promise, saying that far more PPE (personal protective equipment) than is currently available would be needed to make the health secretary\u2019s pledge possible.\nRevised guidance for the care home sector, published on Wednesday, says that while homes should limit unnecessary visits, \u201cwe are clear that visits at the end of life are important both for the individual and their loved ones and should continue\u201d.\nThe initiative follows a long series of reports about care homes going into effective lockdown, with relatives forced to say goodbye to loved ones through windows, by phone, or by letters read out by a care worker in protective clothing.\nIn one care home in Buckinghamshire, the wife of a dying man passed some of her perfume through to a care worker to place under her husband\u2019s chin to evoke a final memory. In another home in Nottinghamshire, one family\u2019s only opportunity to say goodbye was to gather in the car park and watch as undertakers removed their loved one\u2019s body.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said that rather than a change of policy, the move was an attempt to help care homes to be as flexible as possible in allowing visits when a resident is approaching death, given proper infection control measures.\nSome care homes have been taking steps to allow people in to see their loved ones in final moments, but it has been done on an ad hoc basis.\nA spokesperson for MHA, one of the largest charitable providers of care homes, said that the announcement had little practical impact. \u201cThere is nothing stopping relatives saying goodbye in care homes now as long as they have sufficient PPE,\u201d they said. \u201cSo this goes back to the problem of there not being sufficient PPE for the staff, never mind families.\u201d\nProf Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, welcomed the promise of \u201cnew procedures\u201d to allow loved ones to say goodbye, but noted that it would not be practical in many settings.\n\u201cIf that is going to be developed, that is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be easier to do in some settings than others. Some sites will have to make the decision about whether there is a risk to others in the home. If they provide much higher levels of PPE, that should make it possible.\u201d\nSpeaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Hancock said the revised guidelines had been drawn up with Public Health England and the care sector \u201cso we can limit the risk of infection while, wherever possible, giving people\u2019s closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye\u201d.\nThe new guidelines relate only to care homes. For hospitals, existing NHS England guidance, last updated a week ago, says that during the pandemic, one immediate family member or carer can visit if the person \u201cis receiving end-of-life care\u201d, a category which includes patients who are critically ill with the coronavirus.\nThe health secretary used the press conference to repeatedly praise carers for the role they had played in the crisis and showed a carers\u2019 badge, intended to provide the same discounts and advantages given by some businesses to NHS staff.\nHe praised the work of care home staff in providing occupants with \u201cdignity at end of lives\u201d, but said this work had been hampered by the coronavirus. Hancock said this would be changed so that, \u201cwherever possible\u201d, loved ones could say goodbye.\n\u201cWanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts and it\u2019s a moment that will be with you forever,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cDone right, it can help those left behind to cope and it brings comfort to those who are dying.\n\u201cCoronavirus, of course, has made this much more difficult, and I\u2019ve been really moved and upset by some of the heartbreaking stories of people dying without a loved one nearby.\u201d\nHancock cited the example of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13-year-old boy who died in hospital without any family members present.\n\u201cAs a father of a 13-year-old myself, the reports of Ismail, dying aged 13 without a parent at his bedside, made me weep,\u201d Hancock said.\nHancock also pledged an end to the occasional practice of older care home residents being categorised as a group as not requiring resuscitation, without consultation with their families.\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019re making it crystal clear that it is unacceptable for advanced care plans, including \u2018do not attempt to resuscitate\u2019 orders, to be applied in a blanket fashion to any group of people. This must always be a personalised process.\u201d\nThe updated 34-page guidance for care homes stresses this message on mass do-not-resuscitate orders, also covering areas such as how to limit infection, caring for staff and funding options.",

        "content": "Plans to ease coronavirus lockdown prompt clashes among state premiers over timetable\nConservative politicians vying for the leadership of Angela Merkel\u2019s party argued over a timetable to exit the nationwide lockdown as the German chancellor announced plans to partially reopen schools and shops in the coming weeks.\nHailing latest figures indicating a slowing down of the infection rate as a \u201cfragile intermediate success\u201d, Merkel said on Wednesday evening that teaching at schools across the country would start again from 4 May, initially for students in their final years of primary or secondary school.\nHairdressing salons will also be allowed to reopen on 4 May if they take special steps to guarantee customers\u2019 hygiene. Shops of up to 800 square metres in size, as well as bookshops, bike stores and car dealerships, will open again from this coming Monday.\nSocial distancing measures will remain in place until 3 May and large cultural events, such as concerts and beer festivals, will remain banned until the end of August.\nMerkel \u201curgently recommended\u201d people to wear protective masks on public transport and while shopping, but stopped short of making them mandatory. \u201cWe have achieved something that wasn\u2019t guaranteed,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cOur health system has kept running\u201d.\nHowever, under Germany\u2019s federalised system the closure and reopening of schools and nurseries falls under the jurisdiction of the states or L\u00e4nder, meaning any concerted exit strategy envisioned by Merkel requires a consensus among the 16 state premiers, which has been hard to achieve.\nMerkel stepped out in front of the cameras to make her announcement an hour and a half late following a video conference that reportedly involved clashes between the most powerful state premiers. Disagreements over the timetable for an exit route out of the lockdown have cut across German party line in unexpected ways.\nUntil the crisis rewired the dynamics of German politics, Armin Laschet, the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, was seen as the frontrunner in a trio of male politicians vying to take over the leadership of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, and the closest option there was to a continuity candidate.\nBut in the heated discussion over the timetable for relaxing the current restrictions on social movement, Laschet has at times found himself at odds with the chancellor whose decisions he loyally defended at the peak of the 2015 refugee crisis.\nOn Tuesday this week German media reported that North-Rhine Westphalia was intending to start reopening schools as soon as next week, after the end of the Easter holidays \u2013 a unilateral move that put him at odds with the head of government. \u201cArmin Laschet, the barger\u201d, ran a headline in the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.\nMerkel appeared to hint at her opposition to Laschet\u2019s stance on Wednesday when she warned against \u201crushing ahead\u201d to end the lockdown.\nLaschet has also been accused of trying to rush researchers into providing the scientific data to support his call for a speedy path out of the lockdown. A pioneering case study Laschet helped to commission of the Covid-19 outbreak in Heinsberg, a municipality on the Dutch border that has been described as \u201cGermany\u2019s Wuhan\u201d, has gained much media attention but scientists question whether its findings can already be applied to the rest of the country.\nFor the conservative premier of Bavaria, Markus S\u00f6der, the pandemic has boosted his national profile. The leader of the Christian Social Union, sister party to the CDU, is not officially in the running to fill the soon to be vacant seat at the top of Germany\u2019s biggest political party, but his leadership has given him a reach that is historically unusual for politicians from Germany\u2019s southernmost state, whose strong cultural identity and Catholic roots can make its public figures less relatable further north.\nAs others dithered over lockdown measures, S\u00f6der took decisive steps to close down schools, bars and restaurants that the rest of the country eventually followed. One subsequent popularity ranking had the 53-year-old overtaking Merkel, making him Germany\u2019s most popular politician for the first time.\nIn a statement on Wednesday S\u00f6der was keen to remind the public of his achievements, noting that while Germany had coped with the pandemic better than other states across the world, \u201cwe should not forget that things could have been different if we have acted wrongly or too slowly\u201d.\nThe two remaining candidates aspiring to lead the CDU, the veteran rightwinger Friedrich Merz and the foreign policy expert Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, have meanwhile struggled to build a profile as neither of them hold executive positions. Merz, who is popular with large parts of the membership, announced that he had been infected with Covid-19 on 17 March, but has reportedly since recovered.",

        "content": "Government urged to end speculation as national primary school offer day looms\nThe head of England\u2019s most successful academy trust has called on the government to set a date for the reopening of schools, as parents across England anticipate national offer day for primary schools.\nHamid Patel, chief executive of Star Academies, which runs a string of outstanding state schools in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, said setting a date would provide a sense of purpose and put a stop to the distraction of endless speculation.\nHe was speaking on the eve of national offer day, when parents across England find out if their child has got a place at their primary school of choice for this September. This year it has been overshadowed by the continuing uncertainty about when schools will reopen following the Covid-19 lockdown.\n\u201cConfirmation of a date will of course be subject to medical advice \u2013 but having a date in mind is essential,\u201d said Patel. \u201cThis could either be in mid-May or immediately after May half-term.\n\u201cSetting a date will provide a clear sense of purpose and avoid the confusion and distraction of endless speculation. People will be more likely to maintain compliance with social distancing measures if there is an end point in sight.\u201d\nThere has been increasing speculation about when schools will reopen. The government has already had to clarify they will not open straight after the Easter holidays, while some school leaders have suggested a return in July for a few weeks before the school holidays are due to start.\nA number of ministers are reported to be pushing for a much earlier date, suggesting that younger pupils should be allowed to return to school as early as 11 May to enable other lockdown restrictions to be relaxed.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, calling for the government to set out its plans for lifting the lockdown, said he thought reopening schools and mass testing should be among the first priorities.\nThe government has said it will only reopen schools when the scientific evidence says it is safe to do so. Ministers will, however, be watching other countries closely as they grapple with the same dilemma. In Denmark, where there have been far fewer deaths and lower rates of infection, children up to the age of 11 are returning to nurseries and schools this week.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, suggested a phased approach to reopening, with certain year groups going back first. \u201cThe reality is that a vaccination against Covid-19 could be 18 months or more away. So, we are going to need an interim plan,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat could be built around social distancing measures \u2013 such as limiting class sizes and staggering break times, the use of protective equipment such as face masks, and regular cleaning of premises.\u201d\nCommenting on national offer day, Paul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, which represents the majority of primary school leaders, said: \u201cIt is vital that no child going through the primary admissions process this year should be disadvantaged.\n\u201cFor those families not getting their first choice of school, the appeals process will be going ahead, albeit virtually. This process must be as robust as ever and be made clear to parents.\u201d\nLast year, 90.6% of pupils were offered their first choice of primary school and 97.5% of pupils were offered one of their top three choices.",

All of us \u2013 even the most experienced Sunday Supplementers (your Winters, your Samuels, your Liews), have done \u201cI miss football\u201d and \u201cDoes it matter anyway?\u201d We do and it kind of does. So what now?\nLike a manager desperate for a result at any cost \u2013 perhaps you revert back to old tactics, your Wilsons analysing the influence of 1920s Hungarian tactics on Dave Bassett, your Delaneys and all your Harrises giving their mentions another hammering by questioning Middle East states buying Premier League clubs.\nMy fallback, as Barry Glendenning politely puts it on the Guardian Football Weekly podcast, is \u201cWhat I did on my summer holidays\u201d journalism, perhaps something about my dad and my childhood and amateur football. It resonates \u2013 other people have dads, play football and were, at one point, children.\nMaybe it\u2019s time to accept the inevitable and trot out some transfer rumours. How many of us will sleep better tonight if we speculate where Jack Grealish, Declan Rice and Donny van de Beek might be in six months? As long as it\u2019s outside \u2013 and permitted \u2013 that will surely do.\nIt\u2019s too early for \u201cWhat isolation has taught me\u201d, given many of them are already in people\u2019s drafts, and sports journalists should make a collective solemn vow never to publish them. Really, you just need a column to go in off your backside and then they\u2019ll start to flow.\nOne alternative, for all of us, is to completely reinvent ourselves. After all, no one can see you and the only thing we\u2019re really concentrating on is trying to avoid people walking directly towards us. If it doesn\u2019t work, no one will remember and you can blame it on the lockdown.\nSo here goes. For too long now (not that anyone would notice) I have been avoiding confrontation, trying to keep gainful employment by just offering inoffensive platitudes and harmless nostalgia. Well not any more. I\u2019m here for clicks and retweets. Here to cause controversy for the sake of it. The 5G conspiracy theorist of football. Here to expose what the mainstream media \u2013 excluding Eamonn Holmes, of course \u2013 have tried to hide from you for years. In footballing terms that means taking something good and exposing it as somehow fraudulent.\nIt\u2019s 6 September 1995. A meaningless England friendly against Colombia at Wembley. We all know the moment. Ren\u00e9 Higuita\u2019s scorpion kick to clear Jamie Redknapp\u2019s overhit cross. A moment so extraordinary it ranked 94th in Channel 4\u2019s 100 Greatest Sporting Moments in 2002, above Arthur Ashe winning Wimbledon and one place below Zola Budd\u2019s and Mary Decker\u2019s collision in 1984.\nBut Higuita\u2019s scorpion kick was a fraud. I know. I was there. Not many of us were. As Richard Williams wrote in this paper: \u201cIf there were in reality even half the officially reported number of 20,000 spectators in the stadium it would be a surprise.\u201d\nIt was my second England game, and my second goalless draw after watching a stalemate with Norway the previous year when Dennis Wise filled the troublesome left side and Steve Bould played his last game for his country. Anyone who was at that game would be forgiven for being put off international football for life.\nThere were first starts for Nicky Barmby and Steve McManaman, while Redknapp got his debut. It turned out to be John Barnes\u2019s final outing in an England shirt. That should be the story of this game when we look back. A man who scored that goal at the Maracan\u00e3, who gave us hope where there had been none against Argentina in \u201986, who had to put up with vile abuse for much of his international career.\nBut it is Higuita\u2019s game. In the Guardian in 2007, the brilliant Marcela Mora Y Araujo said: \u201cHis scorpion kick in a friendly against England at Wembley is of undeniable wow status, and\u2026 served to position him in fandom psyche as one of the most entertaining players ever to grace the pitches.\u201d\nDavid Ospina talked about it on the eve of the 2018 Carabao Cup final: \u201cWe were delighted \u2026 we talked about it a lot. It was great he did it at Wembley, too. For us Colombians, Higuita is a really important figure, it\u2019s nice that he is remembered here for something special.\u201d\nAfter the game, Higuita said: \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing only one person can do. I have a massive repertoire but I don\u2019t plan them ahead.\u201d I beg to differ, Ren\u00e9.\n\u201cGoodness me!\u201d exclaimed Ian Darke in commentary. \u201cHave you ever seen anything like it in your life from a goalkeeper?\u201d Well yes I had. For the entire warm-up. Over and over and over again. Scorpion kick after scorpion kick after scorpion kick. When it happened in the game, I remember thinking: \u201cI\u2019ve seen that before, about 25 minutes ago.\u201d And it was offside and the ball from Redknapp was so perfect you wonder if he was in on it \u2013 there\u2019s your 5G mast right there.\nYou may ask whether this really matters? Why can\u2019t we just have fond memories, even if it means we can\u2019t handle the truth? It\u2019s also quite obvious now that in attempting to move away from my \u201cWhat I did on my summer holidays\u201d Fisher Price school of journalism, I have drawn upon a story quite literally from my summer holidays.\nAnd while we\u2019re here, I should point out that even if Higuita did see the linesman\u2019s flag, and even if he did practise the move, so what: it\u2019s still some feat to pull that off and make clean contact. So I take it all back. What a glorious \u201cI was there\u201d moment.\nSo (leans back in chair) perhaps that is what isolation has taught me. There will be no reinvention in lockdown. Not for me, not for you, not for Ren\u00e9 Higuita. Those of us lucky enough to emerge from this will come out pretty much the same as we went in. If that means living off a split-second acrobatic jump, then you are probably winning.",

        "content": "A dig into the data on the business interruption loan scheme unearths several areas of concern\nDo not be misled by the government\u2019s painful attempt to present a doubling in coronavirus loans to small businesses as good news. The numbers are still shockingly low: 6,020 firms have borrowed a grand total of just \u00a31.1bn in three weeks. The doubling in the past week merely represents an improvement from a dribble to a trickle. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, had promised a flood.\nDig deeper into the statistics around the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme, or CBILS, and there are at least three areas of concern.\nFirst, \u00a31.1bn of lending needs to be seen in the context of the stock of outstanding loans to small and medium-sized businesses before the pandemic. That figure was roughly \u00a3155bn, according to the Bank of England\u2019s figures in February. So CBILS has barely moved the dial.\nSecond, Royal Bank of Scotland says it has approved roughly 3,000 loans and lent \u00a3500m under CBILS. So it accounts for almost half the total by value and volume, about twice its \u201cnatural\u201d share under normal conditions. Why? Are other banks dragging their feet? Or are the RBS systems just better equipped to handle requests for ultra-low sums such as \u00a35,000, where demand is said to be greatest?\nOr, as some suggest, are other banks being entangled in the thicket of \u201cknow your customer\u201d rules when lending to first-time borrowers? If so, why wasn\u2019t the problem, a long-standing industry grumble, foreseen by the Treasury? At the very least, the authorities should insist that lending data is reported on a bank-by-bank basis so everyone can see where the blockages lie.\nThird, why is there a massive gap between the number of inquiries about CBILS, which is estimated at over 300,000, and the 28,461 actual applications? Duplicate inquires distort the picture, but that\u2019s not a full answer. As the Federation of Small Businesses asks, how many firms are dropping out at the application stage, and why? UK Finance, the bankers\u2019 trade body, does not even offer a figure for rejected applications, another gap in the data. Visibility is terrible.\nA quick and popular proposal is to extend the state guarantee over CBILS loans to 100%, rather than 80%. Germany made that switch and has lent \u20ac7bn under its equivalent scheme. Pressure is building on the Treasury to follow.\nThe danger in a free-and-easy 100% approach is the moral hazard. Some unviable businesses would be funded, increasing losses for the state. Fraud might also go up. An 80% system gives banks skin in the game, in the jargon, and so protects the public purse, so one can see why the Treasury took that route.\nYet the risk in the current set-up is that too little money reaches small businesses at their point of maximum stress. They need to be around for the recovery. One tweak, as discussed at the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, would be to put a 100% guarantee only on loans below \u00a325,000. It\u2019s an idea, and the Treasury may have others. But it ought to do something: CBILS isn\u2019t delivering.\nIf the shareholders will not cooperate, change the shareholders. This seems to be the approach at Ferguson, the FTSE 100 builders\u2019 merchants we still remember as Wolseley.\nThe company\u2019s operations are almost entirely in the US these days and, with the local activist Nelson Peltz making mischief in the wings, the board wants to move the primary stock market listing to New York, supposedly in search of a deeper pool of capital. There\u2019s a problem, though: 75% shareholder approval is required and Ferguson doesn\u2019t think it would get it. UK investors, some constrained by their mandates, rather like owning UK-listed shares.\nFerguson\u2019s solution is either ingenious or devious, depending on your point of view. First, it will seek a secondary listing in the US, which should attract more US funds to the register. Then, within a year, the board will reheat the idea of a full shift to New York and hope the newly-arrived shareholders will shove the majority above 75%.\nIt\u2019s a plan, and it may work. Yet the Ferguson board\u2019s obsession with a full-fat US listing seems perverse. Just get a secondary listing and assess the \u201ccapital pool\u201d thesis over the course of a few years. It\u2019s the obvious compromise solution when shareholder opinion is divided. UK investors, let\u2019s hope, will stand their ground.",

At the same time US oil prices tumbled to 18-year lows of $19.20 a barrel after the quickest rise in surplus oil supplies in history.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) told the market to brace for the lowest oil demand in 25 years because of the global lockdown across numerous countries and territories to contain the virus.\nOil demand will this month hit its lowest levels for the year, according to the agency, falling below last year\u2019s average by 29m barrels per day to reach levels not seen since 1995.\n\u201cEven assuming that travel restrictions are eased in the second half of the year, we expect that global oil demand in 2020 will fall by 9.3m barrels a day versus 2019, erasing almost a decade of growth,\u201d the IEA said.\nThe sharp collapse in oil demand has left the global market oversupplied with enough crude to overwhelm storage facilities in landlocked oilfields. In the US, oil inventories climbed by more than 19m barrels in the last week, the biggest one-week increase in history.\nThe fresh price falls come days after the world\u2019s largest oil producers within the Opec cartel agreed with its allies and other G20 countries to cut up to 20m barrels a day fromproduction from next month.\nThe IEA said there was \u201cno feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset\u201d the impact of the virus on global oil demand but added that the plan was a \u201csolid start\u201d.\nThe IEA\u2019s warning emerged hours after the International Monetary Fund predicted the deepest recession since the Great Depression because of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe latest IEA report says the oil market is at its darkest moment in what will be a historic year for the industry because of the unprecedented global lockdown.\nOver the second quarter of the year, demand for oil will fall 23.1m barrels a day below 2019 levels, before a gradual recovery over the second half of the year. By December, oil demand will be 2.7m barrels a day lower than at the end of last year.\nData commissioned by the Guardian this month shows that the coronavirus is likely to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system and erase 2.5bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel industry.\nThis would be the biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined.\nThe IEA\u2019s findings underline fears among oil traders that the deal hammered out between Opec and its allies over the Easter weekend would prove \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to prevent further oil price falls.\nThe plunging oil market price has forced oil rigs producing more than a million barrels a day to shut and wiped billions from the market value of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies.\nOn Wednesday morning, shares in Royal Dutch Shell fell by almost 5% to \u00a31,348p, while BP shares fell by 5.5% to 303.35p.",

The IMF thinks the UK\u2019s deficit will rise from 2.1% of GDP to 8.3%, the same as in Spain but slightly lower than Italy\u2019s 9.5% of GDP shortfall.\nThe fiscal monitor also said there was likely to be a sharp increase in national debt ratios for governments as a result of the hefty budget deficits they would run in order to cope with the twin health and economic emergency. \u201cAlthough a sizeable increase in deficits this year is necessary and appropriate for many countries, the starting position in some cases presents vulnerabilities (global public debt was 83% of GDP in 2019).\u201d\nGlobal debt is expected to rise from 83.3% to 96.4% of global GDP, with only Germany (68.7%) and the UK (95.7%) of the G7 group of major industrialised nations having ratios below the world average. The US national debt is projected to rise from 109% to 131% of GDP; Italy\u2019s from 134.8% to 155.5%.\nWhile the budgetary position is predicted to deteriorate sharply in developed countries, the IMF said the situation was more concerning for emerging market and developing economies because they faced multiple shocks that include the pandemic, an abrupt worsening in financing conditions, weak external demand and, for commodity exporters, lower commodity prices.\n\u201cEven after the global community\u2019s efforts to alleviate such financing constraints, these countries will need to reprioritise expenditure toward the health sector while safeguarding key public services (transport, energy, communications) and social protection.\u201d\nGeorgieva said the IMF was responding to the pleas for help from more than half its membership. \u201cWe have just doubled access to our emergency facilities, which will allow us to meet the expected demand of about $100bn in financing. Lending programmes have already been approved at record speed for over 20 countries, with many more to come.\u201d\nThe G20 group of developed and developing nations threw a six-month lifeline to more than 70 of the world\u2019s poorest nations on Wednesday by agreeing to suspend sovereign debt payments until the end of the year, and urged private creditors to join the initiative on a voluntary basis.",

The Scottish Professional Football League has also, as expected, started a consultation process on an expanded top flight.\nThe SPFL\u2019s process of calling placings for the lower three tiers via a resolution descended into farce after it emerged Dundee rescinded their delayed \u2018no\u2019 vote last Friday. By Wednesday the Championship club had delivered a vote in favour \u2013 sufficient to pass the motion to trigger promotion, relegation and payment of prize money.\nThe Premiership now has a mandate to do likewise but has been anxious not to antagonise Uefa, which asked that no leagues were to be decided until the end of this month.\n\u201cWhilst more than 80% of clubs agreed with the directors\u2019 written resolution it\u2019s clear that others were strongly opposed,\u201d said Murdoch MacLennan, the SPFL\u2019s chairman. \u201cThere has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward.\u201d\nDundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers have thereby been handed championships. In the top league Celtic are 13 points clear of Rangers, having played 30 matches to their rivals\u2019 29.\nHearts, Partick Thistle and Stranraer - all now facing relegation - have an element of hope via reconstruction talks that were in the pipeline before Dundee\u2019s volte face. Ann Budge, the Hearts owner, and Hamilton\u2019s Les Gray will head a taskforce with a 14-team Premiership regarded as the most realistic plan.\nWhether Partick follow through with a legal challenge to the league remains to be seen. Their QC\u2019s advice was that passing of the resolution would be invalid. Stranraer, who were eight points adrift in League One, have said ending the season is \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d.\n\u201cAt this unprecedented time we felt unanimously as a committee that no football club, Stranraer FC or any other, should be at a detriment due to this horrendous situation,\u201d a club statement said. \u201cIt is grossly unfair that any club should be relegated from their respective league whilst a quarter of the season still remains.\u201d\nDundee reflected on a period \u201cfraught with anxiety, vitriol and conspiracy theory\u201d. They added: \u201cWe have discussed options with a variety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal. Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on a more equitable footing.\u201d\nA lower league chairman said Dundee, through an apparent wish to help demoted clubs, floated the possibility of diverting funds intended for those being promoted to ones being relegated. The chairman in question rejected the notion as \u201cmorally not acceptable\u201d and it was not advanced any further.\nRangers have reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the SPFL\u2019s handling of the voting affair. The league, which has called on Rangers to hand over evidence the club insist raises \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d, has shown no willingness to allow such an inquiry.\nRangers are unwilling to provide documentation directly to the league, as reiterated in a letter sent to the SPFL.",

Fellow England players such as Maro Itoje and the Vunipola brothers are set to be similarly affected as the disgraced Premiership champions fight to stay afloat.\nSaracens have asked all players earning more than \u00a375,000 to defer wages until the start of next season - currently scheduled for September - and for Farrell that means a deferral of around 90% of his wages for five months. The measures would lead to the majority of their squad affected, with wages deferred, and suggest a degree of scepticism at Saracens that their current Premiership campaign will be finished.\nThe club announced that deferred salaries would be repaid over an 18-month period but it is unclear whether they would be included in this season\u2019s wage bill or for the 2021-22 Premiership campaign, assuming Saracens are promoted next season.\nSaracens - already condemned to relegation due to their salary cap breaches - have already imposed a 25% pay cut on their squad as part of a blanket move by Premiership clubs that was strongly criticised on Wednesday by the Rugby Players\u2019 Association(RPA). Saracens also became the latest club to announce they are taking advantage of the government\u2019s furlough scheme.\nSaracens did not say whether the proposed wage deferrals have been formally accepted by the players but they are said to be \u201coverwhelmingly supportive\u201d. Itoje, who has been the subject of a lucrative loan offer from Racing 92 for next season, said: \u201cIn order to see this through the whole organisation needs to pull together and do what we can for the future of Saracens and our individual careers within the sport.\u201d\nSympathy for Saracens players may be in short supply given the salary cap scandal but the chairman, Neil Golding, insisted the measures were necessary to keep the club afloat. \u201cWe understand this is really tough for everyone, but the reality is that the only way to survive this unprecedented situation as a club is to make these adjustments.\u201d\nThe RPA player liaison officer and former chairman, Christian Day, meanwhile, has hit out at the clubs\u2019 handling of the blanket 25% cuts. As revealed by the Guardian, clubs are likely to face a number of claims for unlawful deduction of wages, with players on low salaries or out of contract at the end of the season unhappy with how the reductions were imposed. \u201cAll clubs have done this their own way,\u201d Day told the BBC. \u201cThere was no discussion with us beforehand and no central discussion from Premiership Rugby either.\n\u201cWhat we would have preferred from the start was a lot more dialogue and understanding which is what seems to be happening in football currently. They are not just saying, \u2018This is going to happen\u2019, there is instead a discussion of why it needs to happen and how it is all going to work.\u201d",

A resolution to consign the 2019-20 campaign to history by 30 June, whether or not the entire schedule of games has been completed, will be among the proposals put to the league.\nAccording to some reports, one of the most significant factors driving the idea to finish by that point \u2013 favoured by a large number of the league\u2019s members \u2013 is the expiry of numerous player and staff contracts by the end of June. One executive from a leading club told the Guardian he was relatively relaxed, with Fifa having issued guidelines last week stating contracts can be extended until such time as the season ends. But he admitted the subject was on the table, with other clubs worried that English contractual law would render the governing body\u2019s stipulations irrelevant. That would lead to hundreds of potentially unresolved situations should fixtures be honoured into July. In theory, an out-of-contract player could then stand himself down from action even if still relied upon by his club for its remaining games.\nIf the proposal to settle the season by 30 June is put to a vote, the Premier League would require a 14-club majority to approve any decision. Should it go through, the chances of completing a 38-game schedule would appear distinctly remote. Most teams have nine games left to play while four \u2013 Manchester City, Sheffield United, Arsenal and Aston Villa \u2013 must play 10. While clubs in Germany have returned to training, that scenario is still some way off in England. Then there would be the issue of getting players match-fit ahead of what, even if the league was cleared to resume behind closed doors at the start of June, would be an intense schedule.\nCurtailing the campaign along the proposed lines would not equate to voiding it if some fixtures remain unplayed, although it is unclear what efforts would be required to land upon a final league table that broadly satisfied everyone. Redoubling efforts to draw a line under 2019-20 would, the clubs believe, mean planning for 2020-21 could take place under less of a cloud and reduce the extent to which two seasons are hampered by the crisis.",

Its technical expertise, guidance and leadership is supporting countries to implement optimum science-based strategies to prevent and control Covid-19, and will catalyse global action against future health emergencies.\u201d\nTrump announced late on Tuesday that US funding would be put on hold for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the WHO\u2019s warnings about the coronavirus and China. He accused the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat, even though it declared a public health emergency on 30 January.\nOn 26 February, during a coronavirus task force press briefing at the White House, Trump said: \u201cI want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it that \u2013 and I spoke with Dr Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it: the flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me.\n\u201cAnd, so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery, one is \u2013 one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover, but the others are in great shape. But think of that: 25,000 to 69,000.\u201d\nMark Suzman, chief executive of the Gates Foundation \u2013 the second largest funder of the WHO after the US \u2013 said he would \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d any cuts to the funding of the WHO which was critical to the Covid-19 crisis. He also announced a further $150m donation towards the hunt for a vaccine, for which the foundation plans to build factories and therapeutics.\nThe UK government\u2019s response was lukewarm. Asked about Trump\u2019s decision, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cOur position is that the UK has no plans to stop funding the WHO, which has an important role to play in leading the global health response. Coronavirus is a global challenge and it\u2019s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat.\u201d\nAsked if this meant No 10 was disappointed by the president\u2019s move, the spokesman said: \u201cI can only set out the UK\u2019s position and that is we have no plans to stop funding the WHO.\u201d\nAt his daily press briefing in Geneva, the director general of the WHO expressed regret at the US move and warned that the coronavirus would exploit divisions among those trying to fight it.\nWhen the pandemic was over, WHO\u2019s performance against Covid-19 would be scrutinised, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, but now was not the time. \u201cCovid-19 does not discriminate between rich nations and poor, large nations and small. It does not discriminate between nationalities, ethnicities or ideologies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle against a common threat. When we are divided, the coronavirus exploits the cracks between.\u201d\nThe US had been a long-standing and generous friend to WHO and they hoped it would continue to be so, said Tedros. \u201cWe regret the decision of the president of the United States to order a halt in funding to WHO.\u201d\nHe and his colleagues mounted a robust defence of their actions. WHO had not hesitated to warn of the possibility of human-to-human transmission, they said. As early as 11 January, it issued guidance on the dangers of droplets spreading from one person to another, which could transmit the infection to frontline health workers, as happened in Sars, said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, an American infectious diseases epidemiologist working at WHO.\nExperts fear that the work of the WHO in fighting disease and improving health and healthcare systems around the world could be jeopardised. At issue is not just the response to the current pandemic, and major programmes such as polio eradication which receives substantial funds from the US, but the collaboration between scientists and doctors at institutions around the world, who will hesitate to pool their knowledge and expertise if they think there may be political consequences.\n\u201cThe WHO is a place where anxieties and concerns can be discussed without the sense that you are going to be somehow called out,\u201d said David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College London who worked at the highest levels of WHO for many years.\n\u201cThe challenge for the director general of WHO is always to maintain the core values of public health even when this goes against some of the political priorities of elected leaders. It is not unusual for there to be some form of conflict. The challenge is to try to create an environment where the opportunity for people to share is maintained and they are not having to look over their shoulder in fear that they are going to fall foul of the political priorities of leaders.\u201d\nDavid Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, also emphasised WHO\u2019s role as a forum for the world\u2019s scientists and health experts.\n\u201cThe strength of WHO is that it is able to bring together public health experts from around the world to exchange information, review scientific evidence, and make evidence based consensus recommendations on disease prevention and control,\u201d he said.\nPublic health and infectious diseases experts said the WHO needed more funds, not less, to lead the fight against the pandemic and help low and middle-income countries, where it plays a crucial role.\n\u201cWe are facing the greatest challenge of our lifetime and the WHO is doing an extraordinary job ensuring every country can tackle this virus, protect citizens and save lives,\u201d said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of research charity the Wellcome Trust. \u201cNo other organisation can do what they do and we owe them all our respect, thanks and gratitude. This is a time for solidarity not division.\u201d",

The commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, has already relaxed the rules to help governments provide financial lifelines to companies, which in normal economic times would be seen as anti-competitive.\nThe latest paper assesses further measures that may be needed, after economists at the International Monetary Fund warned the world was on the brink of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.\nThe document examines how governments might support ailing companies by taking equity stakes as part of rescue schemes, described as \u201can intervention of the last resort\u201d.\nInsiders are uncertain when the document will be published, and expect it to be changed after discussions between Vestager and her fellow commissioners, followed by EU member states.\nCompanies benefiting from a coronavirus-related equity stake would be barred from \u201caggressive commercial expansion financed by state aid\u201d.

People are being sent home, essentially, to die there.\n\u201cWe are going to people in their late 60s and have been told before we get there that they have tested positive for Covid and have a DNR, do not resuscitate[order], that\u2019s been put in place by a doctor, so they are not for resuscitation. We arrive and they have oxygen levels of 85% or below and they are not going to recover.\n\u201cThere has been a significant increase in people dying at home. It\u2019s rare now for me to do a shift and not to use a procedure called ROLE \u2013 which stands for recognition of life extinct \u2013 with someone, but it used to be maybe once a week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening a lot in care homes and that is heartbreaking. Big care homes will have 70 to 80 residents and carers will wander from one room to the next without changing personal protective equipment as they don\u2019t have any. A colleague was saying to me last Friday that it\u2019s very likely coronavirus will decimate entire care homes, and everyone in them is so vulnerable and the policy is so lax.\n\u201cA number of other patients are also dying at home from cardiac arrest. Now in our area the ROLE procedure has changed because of the volume of patients who are dying. We have always had ROLE but what is new is that, because of the volume of [such cases], they are changing the way we do it. You would normally need a GP to confirm that someone has died and why, but due to the sheer volume at the moment that is not practical.\n\u201cIn the job last week we did three ROLEs in one nursing home in one night. That is almost unheard of.\n\u201cThis is really significant. Are these deaths at home being recorded in the daily statistics of deaths? No, they\u2019re not at the moment. Is that a way of the numbers [of overall Covid-related deaths] being fudged?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the policy is elsewhere, but here in the West Midlands ambulance personnel have been told to continue trying to resuscitate people who do not have a DNR in place, including those who have suffered a cardiac arrest, even though hospital doctors in the region have been told not to undertake an active attempt to resuscitate someone. The resuscitate procedure is important because it puts clinicians at risk of catching the coronavirus.\n\u201cA nurse I know was left heartbroken by the new policy. She said that she saw a 25-year-old die and there was no attempt to resuscitate. You have got nurses breaking down in corridors saying they became a nurse to help, not watch people die.\n\u201cBefore, when we brought patients in, they would be taken to resuscitate. But now a doctor jumps in the back of the ambulance and calls it. The doctor will say \u2018stop all active attempts to resuscitate life\u2019 and they are probably correct in doing that. But the difficult question is that it is putting stress on paramedics. Why are we being hung out to do all we can and then a doctor just jumps on and says \u2018stop\u2019?\u201d",

        "content": "Health secretary puts plenty of bounce into Care badge but bunks off over virus test queries at Q&As\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. Or perhaps not. Matt Hancock had been expected to give the previous day\u2019s Downing Street press briefing but got pulled in favour of Rishi Sunak, following the publication of Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s report suggesting GDP was set to tank by 35% over the next three months.\nSo you might have thought the health secretary would have used the extra 24 hours to fine-tune his announcements on social care.\nNot so much. Over the past few weeks Hancock has been one of the few cabinet ministers to look even vaguely competent, but today he let his department down, he let his country down, but worst of all he let himself down. And there\u2019s nothing worse than a Tigger who lets a Tigger down. The best he can do now is go home to watch a replay of his press conference and cry himself to sleep.\nHancock began by praising 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore for raising \u00a37m for the NHS by walking round his garden. As well he might. For that \u00a37m probably represents roughly the sum of what the Conservative government has taken out of the NHS each day over the past 10 years or so. Certainly, the legendary Chris Grayling has managed to waste twice that in a single visit to the despatch box in the Commons.\nThereafter it was all downhill. I am here to tell you the next steps in our social care package, Tigger bounced. Which was news to everyone as up till now even the first baby steps had been kept a closely guarded secret.\nWhen Boris Johnson became prime minister he assured the country he had a social care package ready and waiting to go. To go precisely nowhere, as ever since we\u2019ve heard precisely zilch. Nada. Social care for the elderly still appeared to be the government\u2019s lowest priority even during a coronavirus pandemic that disproportionately affected old people.\nSo here was the deal. More workers and care home residents would be getting tested and there would definitely be more personal protection equipment available. Though starting from a baseline of near zero this wasn\u2019t quite the earth-shattering announcement that Hancock had led everyone to expect.\nBut luckily, Tigger was planning on saving the best till last. Because he knew that what social care workers really wanted wasn\u2019t testing, PPE, more money or a home secretary who dismissed them all as low-skilled. It was a shiny new green badge, saying CARE, that he was proud to model.\nA badge. A sodding badge. Even the writers of the TV series The Thick of It wouldn\u2019t have dared come up with something as crass as this. Especially as it was a badge that had already been launched a year previously to the general indifference of everyone in the care home sector.\nThis was Tigger\u2019s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire moment. He was sorry that no social care workers had won the jackpot this week; the producers were withholding the \u00a31m top prize because they suspected cheating had taken place as there had been a lot of background coughing during the recording of the show \u2013 but as a gesture of goodwill, and to make sure no one went home empty-handed, he would be giving every contestant a badge. And a Tigger cuddly toy.\nHard to believe, but the badges really were the high point of the entire 45-minute briefing. Hancock looked genuinely dismayed that the media weren\u2019t quite as wowed by them as he was \u2013 Fighting Corona, a Badge at a Time \u2013 and he rather went into meltdown during the question and answer session.\nFirst he made out that the reason testing levels had actually fallen in recent days was because NHS workers were far too busy sunning themselves in the park during the Easter Bank holiday weekend and they couldn\u2019t be arsed to come in for a test. You can only imagine the conversations that must have been taking place all over the UK. \u201cShall I go and get the test for which I\u2019ve been begging for for weeks? Or shall I just not bother and top up the tan?\u201d\nHancock also appeared to be clueless as to why the government was seemingly unable to give even a hint of what criteria it would be using when considering a possible relaxation of the lockdown rules. There was no strategy to have a strategy. The best he could come up with was that different governments were at different stages of preparation so it would be wrong to make any comparisons.\nThe strong implication was that our government was still at the \u201ccompletely hopeless\u201d stage of preparation so we shouldn\u2019t be holding our breath for any news any time soon. This is a decision that appears to be well above everyone\u2019s pay grade, including the prime minister\u2019s.\nEven that wasn\u2019t the nadir. Matt can\u2019t go out to meet the press without having a plan of action involving numbers. Last time out he had a five-pillar plan, almost none of which had yet to happen. So why should anyone believe a word he said now?\nLaura Hughes, of the Financial Times, gently pointed out that he had promised 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April and we were still down in the 16,000s. Which made the 100,000 promise in two weeks\u2019 time look totally unrealistic.\nHere Tigger lost the plot. It was all a big lie. A conspiracy. He had never said 25,000 tests by the middle of April. FAKE NEWS. He had said 25,000 by the end of April which he had then increased to 100K. So just wait and see. He believed he could fly. He believed he could touch the sky. Mystic Tigger. Unaccountably, Hughes was the only journalist not granted a supplementary question in which she could nail the inconsistencies in his memory. Instead, he bounced out the room, kissing the badge in triumph. And there we all were thinking it was the bear who had the little brain.",

New York has revised its death toll to more than 10,000 \u2013 adding 3,778 victims that were not tested but are presumed to have died from the virus, with over 27,000 fatalities across the US. World leaders continue to criticise Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cut funding from the World Health Organization, with health experts labelling the move a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d. The European Union\u2019s medicine regulator has predicted it could take a year before a vaccine is available for widespread use, while the G20 has moved to suspend loan debt repayments from poorer nations, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Caribbean from 1 May until the end of the year.\nOne of Australia\u2019s biggest youth travel operators has changed its refunds policy and applied it retrospectively, denying customers who had trips cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Topdeck instead will offer future credit, including to customers previously promised cash refunds. Around Australia, 63 people have died from Covid-19, but South Australia recorded no new cases overnight and Queensland just five new infections in a 24-hour period.\nSweden\u2019s \u201clight-touch approach\u201d to restricting the movements of its citizens has been criticised as the nation marks 1,200 deaths \u2013 nearly 100 times the rate of neighbouring Finland, which enacted a strict early lockdown.

German chancellor Angela Merkel has announced plans to partially reopen schools and shops in coming weeks, hailing the slowing of new cases as a \u201cfragile intermediary success\u201d. And Amazon owner Jeff Bezos has seen his personal fortune rise $24bn since the coronavirus pandemic began, due to his 11% stake in the company that has seen record online sales.\nSix major Australian environmental organisations have petitioned the government to delay its once-a-decade review of national environmental laws, asking for more time for public submissions given the twin crises of bushfires and the coronavirus.\nThe defence department\u2019s use of toxic firefighting chemicals is the subject of a major new class action, with 40,000 residents from towns around Australia having been potentially exposed to carcinogenic chemical compounds, lawyers have argued.\nAn ambitious $150m government-backed research and development program could arrest coral die-off on the Great Barrier Reef, with ideas being considered ranging from brightening clouds with salt crystals to deploying slicks of coral larvae.\nFrontline doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France working during the Covid-19 pandemic will receive bonuses of up to \u20ac1,500 as part of a \u20ac8bn \u201curgent economic plan\u201d announced by the prime minister. There will also be \u20ac4bn allocated for increased protective surgical equipment for staff.\nElizabeth Warren has endorsed Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee, the third significant declaration in as many days following Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, as the Democratic party unifies ahead of the November election.\nScientists have documented a dramatic melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, with a volume of ice equivalent to 197 gigatonnes disappearing during July 2019 alone. High-pressure systems for 63 days during summer \u2013 instead of the average of 28 \u2013 are believed responsible for what\u2019s been called a global \u201calarm signal\u201d.\nIn the era of self-isolation and physical distancing, if you can\u2019t touch others, you may as well touch yourself. Since entering lockdown, the sale of sex toys in New Zealand has tripled and in the US there has been a 30% uptake. \u201cIso for many singles is the equivalent of a sexual ice age. For those who have tried virtual dating, the experience can be frustrating,\u201d writes Brigid Delaney. So is the silver lining of isolation a golden opportunity to explore your own sexuality?\n\u201cIt\u2019s never good to experience the worst growth for a decade right before a global pandemic.\u201d But with private sector building activity declining precipitously and travel arrivals all but completely nonexistent, is a public sector wage freeze the answer? According to Greg Jericho and a new survey from the Centre for Future Work: no.\nDonald Trump\u2019s decision to suspend funding to the World Health Organisation is unconscionable.

One month ago they were changing hands at $1,689.\nBezos, who also owns the Blue Origin company aimed at providing passenger flights into space, has faced criticism for not donating more of his fortune to the efforts to tackle the coronavirus and the economic destruction it is causing.\nHe has so far handed $100m (\u00a380m) to the food bank charity Feeding America; critics have pointed out that the $100m donation made public by Bezos represents less than 0.1% of his fortune.\nAmazon has also been accused of not doing enough to protect its workers from the virus. The company this week fired two employees who criticised Amazon over allegedly unsafe conditions at some of its warehouses.\nAbout 75 Amazon warehouses and delivery workers in the US have been infected with the virus, according to the Washington Post, the newspaper owned by Bezos.\nThe jump in Amazon\u2019s shares came as financial analysts said they expected the company to be crowned \u201ca clear winner\u201d from the Covid-19 crisis and to report record sales and profits this year due to demand for deliveries and its cloud-based services.\nJosh Brown, chief executive of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said on Twitter: \u201cAmazon became a utility in this crisis \u2013 defensive, reliable, indispensable.\u201d\nAnalysts at the US investment bank Cowen likened the impact of the lockdown to the Black Friday shopping frenzy in November.\n\u201cCovid-19 surge led to \u2018Prime Day in March\u2019,\u201d the analyst said in a note to clients. \u201cAmazon has seen an \u2018enormous increase in demand\u2019 as shoppers are forced to stay home, essentially creating an extended Prime Day/Black Friday type of situation.\u201d\nWhile many companies across the world have been forced to make staff redundant or place them on government-funded furlough schemes, Amazon is hiring tens of thousands of staff as the business struggles under the weight of orders from consumers trapped at homes all over the world.\nThe company on Monday said it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. The recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month.\nThe additional workers will take Amazon\u2019s global workforce to nearly 1 million. Amazon said: \u201cWe know many people have been economically impacted as jobs in areas like hospitality, restaurants and travel are lost or furloughed as part of this crisis. We welcome anyone out of work to join us at Amazon until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.\u201d\nBrent Thill, an analyst at the US investment bank Jefferies, said the hirings were \u201cdirect proof consumers are breaking the Amazon supply chain with overwhelming demand\u201d.\nMike Pence, US vice-president, took to Twitter to thank Amazon staff for \u201cworking every day to meet the needs of the American people as we face this pandemic together\u201d.\nIn addition to the 100,000 workers already hired, @Amazon is adding another 75,000 & increasing hourly pay. Thank you, @Amazon for working every day to meet the needs of the American people as we face this pandemic together.https://t.co/nDmoy02E6u\nAnalysts expect Amazon to increase its annual sales by nearly 20% to reach $335bn.\nAmazon on Wednesday threatened to withdraw all deliveries in France, after a French court ruled that it must stop selling \u201cnon-essential\u201d items or face a fine of \u20ac1m a day.\n\u201cOur interpretation of the ruling suggests we might have to suspend the activities of our fulfilment network in France,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said, \u201cWe\u2019re working rapidly to understand the judgment and evaluate our options, and we expect to appeal.\u201d\nJoshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: \u201cAmazon shines from all angles during coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from.\n\u201cAmazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,\u201d he added. \u201cOf all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.\u201d\nJeff Bezos is not the only very wealthy person to have seen their fortune swell as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\nReed Hastings\n The founder and chief executive of Netflix has seen his estimated fortune rise by $195m so far this year to $5.1bn as shares in the entertainment service rose by 40% from the market nadir last month. Hastings owns 2.5% of the shares. Analysts said they expected more people stuck at home to sign up to the streaming service. Analysts at Pivotal Research Group said: \u201cWe believe the unfortunate Covid-19 situation is cementing Netflix\u2019s global dominance .\u201d\nTim SteinerThe co-founder and chief executive of Ocado has seen his the value of his stake jump 40% over the past month as shoppers flock to online supermarkets. Steiner owns about 4% of the shares, which are worth more than \u00a3400m at current prices. He is also in line for a \u00a359m pay package to be voted on at Ocado\u2019s AGM next month.\nThe WaltonsThe family behind Walmart, which also owns Asda in the UK, have seen their combined net worth rise 5% this year to $169bn.

Last year, undocumented immigrants paid $2.5bn in local and state taxes, Newsom said. But still amid this crisis, many find themselves in the impossible situation of having to choose between healthcare and legal status, or continuing essential work without protections.\nCalifornia contributed $75m of the $125m disaster relief fund for undocumented immigrants, with philanthropic groups such as the Emerson Collective, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the James Irvine Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation and the California Endowment providing the additional $50m.\nThe amount should allow for $500 to $1,000 in household assistance, which Governor Newsom acknowledged barely scratched the surface in a state with as high a cost of living as California. \u201cI\u2019m not here to suggest that $125m is enough, but I am here to suggest that it\u2019s a good start and I am very proud that it is starting here in the state of California,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI recognize that we still have more to do in this space,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe will endeavor to find more areas of support in the next days and weeks and over the next year as we transition back to some version of normalcy.\u201d\nThe relief fund comes as the number of Californians filing for unemployment insurance tops 2.7 million, Newsom said. The need for unemployment assistance has risen to a point that the governor signed an executive order launching a new call center to run 12 hours a day, seven days a week to handle the influx.\nNewsom\u2019s announcement was met with both applause and backlash, with the conservative political commentator Tomi Lahren calling the \u201cfund for illegals\u201d \u201cunbelievable\u201d.\nJose Antonio Vargas, journalist and founder of Define American, a not-for-profit that advocates for accurate representation of immigrants in the media, tweeted that other governors, particularly New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, should take note.\n\u201cAs an undocumented immigrant who was raised in California and call the Bay Area my home, thank you,\u201d Vargas wrote to Newsom. \u201cThank you for remembering that undocumented Californians are an inextricable part of our state.\u201d\nThere were 24,421 positive cases reported in California on Wednesday, with 821 deaths. On Tuesday, Newsom cautiously outlined the state\u2019s next steps, saying that there was no specific timeline for when he will modify the stay-at-home order.",

One focused largely on people who had experience of mental health problems while the other involved the UK general public.\nThe team say the surveys flagged widespread concerns among participants about the impact of the coronavirus on mental health, from access to support services to concerns around social isolation and increases in anxiety and other problems.\nWhile Bullmore added that it was understandable that the physical health impacts of Covid-19 had received significant funding, it was also important to prepare for the mental health aspects.\n\u201cWhen we are thinking about this as a health crisis we need to keep thinking about mental and physical health together and not apart,\u201d he said.\nProf Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, welcomed the team\u2019s call for action, adding that mental health research is significantly underfunded, lagging behind funding for illnesses such as cancer.\n\u201cThe long-term mental health impacts of this unprecedented pandemic \u2013 on people with existing mental illness and other vulnerable groups, on the health and social care workforce, and on the healthy population \u2013 are not yet fully known but they may be equally unprecedented,\u201d she said.\n In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

It is vital the government does everything it can to keep them safe too,\u201d the Labour MP wrote in a letter shared with the Guardian.\nThe Labour spokesman asked why the UK \u201cdoes not publish data on testing of military personnel, whereas other countries such as the US do\u201d, and demanded that Wallace make testing \u2013 and its results \u2013 widely available.\nA growing number of soldiers, currently about 3,000, are helping carry out a number of frontline tasks in the UK, including 200 working in the ambulance services, as well as assisting the emergency delivery of protective equipment, oxygen and ventilators for hospitals.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home.

Three weeks ago, sources said there had been fewer than 10 cases, but that figure is well out of date.\nAn MOD spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome dialogue on the important work of Armed Forces during this global crisis, and how to keep them safe while they do their vital job.\n\u201cThe safety and wellbeing of our people is of the utmost importance and we have issued advice in line with the guidance from PHE and the NHS.

After spending a week in self-isolation in March suffering from symptoms of the disease, he returned to work at the beginning of April saying he had recovered from his illness, although he did not take a test to confirm he had been infected.\nThe defence secretary met his Nato counterparts in a special video conference on Wednesday afternoon to discuss how the military alliance can respond to the coronavirus crisis. Ministers discussed the importance of Nato continuing its core function of western defence while member countries were also deploying personnel at home.\nThe UK provides 800 troops to the ongoing defence of Estonia against Russia, while the RAF contributes to the air defence of the Baltic states from Lithuania. Wallace also promised to supply two experts in countering disinformation to formation of a Nato coronavirus communications hub.\nIt also emerged Downing Street had paused work on the planned integrated review of defence and foreign policy due to the pressing need to focus on the coronavirus crisis, according to a letter written by Alex Ellis, the deputy national security adviser, to the defence select committee.",

As snow fell, others got out of their vehicles and raised signs, one of which read, \u201cGov Whitmer We Are Not Prisoners\u201d. Another said \u201cMichigander Against Gretchens Abuses\u201d.\nThe protest, in Lansing, was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, who have dubbed the effort \u201cOperation gridlock\u201d, with the slogan: \u201cShe\u2019s driving us out of business. We\u2019re driving to Lansing.\u201d\nHours later, Whitmer shot back, telling reporters that the rally put health at risk.\n\u201cThe sad irony here was the protest is they don\u2019t like being in this stay-at-home order and they may have just caused a need to lengthen it,\u201d Whitmer said.\nThe ripples of the protest were widely felt: traffic was barely moving for miles in some areas of Lansing.\n\u201cThis arbitrary blanket spread of shutting down businesses, about putting all of these workers out of business, is just a disaster. It\u2019s an economic disaster for Michigan,\u201d a coalition member, Meshawn Maddock, said. \u201cAnd people are sick and tired of it.\u201d\nWhitmer, a Democrat, extended a stay-at-home order through 30 April and has shut down schools and businesses deemed non-essential. The governor acknowledged the pain but said the restrictions were necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness that has killed more than 1,900 Michigan residents and overwhelmed hospitals in the Detroit area.\nDonald Trump has repeatedly attacked Whitmer, a popular Democratic governor, in recent days as she has requested emergency medical supplies for Michigan. The \u201clock her up\u201d chant echoes those leveled by Trump supporters against his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton.\nThe protesters appear to be a vocal minority; Whitmer\u2019s handling of the crisis receives a favorable review from 71% of Michigan residents.\nWhitmer expressed sadness that the thousands of people who attended the protest may have jeopardized their own health by participating in close proximity without masks.\n\u201cWe know this demonstration is going to come at a cost to people\u2019s health,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s how Covid-19 spreads.\u201d\nThe Democratic governor added that ignoring the social distancing guidelines would probably only serve to extend the stay-at-home order.\n\u201cI saw someone handing out candy to little kids barehanded,\u201d the governor told reporters. \u201cPeople are flying the Confederate flag, and untold numbers who gassed up on the way here or grabbed a bite on the way home. We know that this rally endangered people. This kind of activity will put more people at risk and, sadly, it could prolong the amount of time we have to be in this posture.\u201d\nFour sheriffs in the north-western Lower Peninsula called Whitmer\u2019s orders a \u201cvague framework of emergency laws\u201d that are frustrating citizens. The Leelanau county sheriff, Mike Borkovich, said people did not understand why they could not take a child fishing in a motorboat but they could use a kayak.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep the peace with people ... The economy is coming apart in northern Michigan. People are upset,\u201d Borkovich told the Associated Press. \u201cPeople are frantic to get back to work. They have been very edgy.\u201d",

The group\u2019s main brands will continue to trade online while administrators assess options for the future of the business.\nRob Harding, a joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \u201cCovid-19 has had a devastating impact on the entire retail industry, and not least the Oasis Warehouse group.\n\u201cDespite management\u2019s best efforts over recent weeks, and significant interest from potential buyers, it has not been possible to save the business in its current form. Therefore it has been placed into administration.\u201d\nThe government-imposed shutdown of the high street last month has already led to the administration of weak retailers including Debenhams and Cath Kidston. Others are expected to follow.\nThe footwear chain, Office, is also under pressure. Its South African owner, Truworths International, has hired advisers to find a buyer. It seeks a quick deal, which may also involve an administration process.\nThe fashion business\u2019s problems emerged alongside new figures which indicated that retail sales across the UK slumped by more than a quarter in the first two weeks of the UK\u2019s high street lockdown as food stockpiling and a surge in online orders failed to offset the loss of trade in non-essential stores.\nThe British Retail Consortium said the sales decline was the worst on record.\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said sales of fashion and shoes had taken a significant hit while sales of computers and accessories, board games and fitness equipment all rose sharply as a result of the move to home schooling and working from home.\nThe high street closures fuelled a near-20% rise in online non-food sales in March, taking internet sales to an unprecedented 43.5% of the retail market, up from less than 30% in 2019.\nSeparately, Barclaycard reported an 18% jump in digital and content subscriptions, such as Netflix and Now TV, at the end of March. There was also a 17% rise in spending on home improvement and DIY.",

Praising them as \u201csuperparents\u201d, he told them: \u201cThis is hard on everyone but it is especially hard on you.\n\u201cHopefully, through this video we can make it more clear and obvious to government and everybody else that you are in the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 bracket and WellChild needs more help.\u201d\nMore than 100,000 children and young people in the UK have serious health needs. Colin Dyer, the WellChild CEO, told Harry: \u201cThese families are always isolated and hidden. Now they are more isolated and hidden than ever before. Getting recognition that they are amongst the most vulnerable people is really tough, because the focus isn\u2019t on families like this.\u201d\nLeanne Cooper, 37, from Lincoln, has a daughter, Sophie, 13, who has cerebral palsy, uses a wheelchair, has multiple medical needs and has a tracheostomy and so is on a ventilator. She told Harry: \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying.\u201d Sophie needs care \u201c24 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d. With the virus and lockdown, \u201cI can\u2019t really put into words how scary it is,\u201d she said.\nShe and her husband, Craig, have three daughters and must shield. As the manager of Sophie\u2019s care package, she also has to make sure that there are protective measures to safeguard Sophie\u2019s care workers, which is stressful. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a position where carers can\u2019t come to work because they might be symptomatic, there is no way we would survive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if we had no care, I don\u2019t know where we would be.\u201d\nCraig Hatch, 55, and his wife, Elizabeth, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, have stopped using external care workers for their son Fraser, 21, who has cerebral palsy, a chronic lung disorder and diabetes, and uses a wheelchair. The couple, who have four children, said the decision was \u201cpartly to protect the carers, and partly to isolate us\u201d.\nCraig said: \u201cWe are frightened because we know if the virus gets into our house, and if Fraser contracts it, we know the implications are quite severe.\u201d It was \u201cexhausting\u201d, he admitted, and they were worried about obtaining vital medication.\nA WellChild long-term ventilation nurse, Rachel Gregory, said of the families she supports: \u201cThey have to open their doors at this vulnerable time to external carers, which is a huge concern for them, and a huge risk, potentially. There are lots of issues around PPE. The guidelines come out, but often the supply seems to be lacking or slow to be fulfilled.\u201d\nWellChild is wholly reliant on voluntary funding but has lost 60% of its projected income as fundraising events have been cancelled. It has set up a JustGiving resilience fund. Dyer said it was adapting and in \u201csurvival mode\u201d.\nHarry praised the \u201cresilience and the strength\u201d of WellChild families, and the support they gave each other. \u201cYou are a shining example of being superparents, spinning so many plates, juggling so many balls,\u201d he said.\nOf course, there was \u201cthat fear of what might happen\u201d, he added. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much of this out of our control. All of a sudden we now realise how small we are in the grand scheme.\u201d\nHe told them: \u201cThere is no way you can run away from it. As long as you guys and looking after yourselves and each other, that is the best you can do.\u201d\nLeanne said later: \u201cIt was really special he took the time to speak to us.\u201d He was \u201creally intently listening\u201d, she said. \u201cI really hope the video will shine a light and raise awareness for vulnerable families like ours.\u201d The lack of specific advice and guidance mean that \u201cfamilies are feeling lost, and forgotten, and as if they have fallen through the net\u201d, she added.",

        "content": "Independent Sentencing Council recommendations cover seven types of assault including attempted murder\nJudges will be able to impose tougher punishments on anyone convicted of assaulting emergency workers or threatening to transmit diseases under sentencing guidelines proposals published on Thursday.\nThe Independent Sentencing Council recommendations implement changes introduced under the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018, in which a higher statutory maximum of 12 months in prison was introduced.\nDuring the first nine months of last year, the consultation notes, 6,400 offenders were sentenced under this offence.\nEmergency workers include police officers, prison officers, firefighters, search and rescue personnel, NHS medical and support staff as well as doctors\u2019 receptionists and NHS administrative staff whose activities involve contact with the public.\nThe council this month published interim guidance on dealing with cases involving attempts to spread coronavirus. It states: \u201cWhere sentencing common assault offences involving threats or activity relating to transmission of Covid-19 the court should treat this as an aggravating feature of the offence.\u201d\nThe courts are taking such assaults more seriously. In Manchester on Wednesday, a man was sentenced to a year in jail for spitting at three police officers in Greater Manchester.\nIn its consultation, the sentencing council states: \u201cThe legislation has not increased maximum sentences for these more serious offences, but instead makes the commission of an ABH [actual bodily harm] or GBH [grievous bodily harm] against an emergency worker a statutory aggravating factor, to provide for an uplift to be applied to the sentence in the same way in which other statutory aggravating factors, such as previous convictions of an offender, provide for an increased sentence.\u201d\nThe council said its proposed changes reflected \u201cthe clear intention of parliament to increase sentences for assaults on those designated as emergency workers. All but one offence category therefore provides for a custodial sentence to be imposed, and half of the categories include custodial starting points.\n\u201cThe most serious offence category provides for a sentence of up to the full statutory maximum sentence of 12 months\u2019 custody to be imposed. While parliament may yet consider if this maximum sentence should be increased further, the guideline reflects the current statutory provisions.\u201d\nThe consultation also introduces an additional aggravating factor relating to \u201cemergency workers who may be isolated and unable to escape an assault\u201d. This would include offences where medical staff are assaulted when isolated while treating an individual. Spitting or coughing has also been included as an aggravating factor.\nThe sentencing council proposals cover seven different types of assault including attempted murder. The council spokesperson, Mr Justice Julian Goose, said: \u201cAssault offences can be very personal crimes. It is important that sentences should be appropriate and proportionate, and reflect the harm caused to victims.\n\u201cThese guidelines will provide the courts with a framework for sentencing a range of offences, from high-volume common assault to attempted murder. When in force, they will provide protection in the years ahead for the public and the people who serve them by providing public services or as emergency workers.\u201d\nCommenting on the proposals, the justice minister Chris Philp said: \u201cNever has the debt of gratitude we owe our emergency workers been greater \u2013 they are heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe.\n\u201cThese guidelines send a clear message that those who seek to harm them will feel the full force of the law.\u201d",

        "content": "Coronavirus changing alcohol habits, as one person in five consumes more\nThe coronavirus lockdown is transforming Britons\u2019 relationship with alcohol, as research reveals that some have increased their consumption, but an even larger number are drinking less or have stopped entirely.\nWhile one in five people \u2013 equating to 8.6 million adults \u2013 said they were drinking alcohol more frequently in lockdown, to researchers\u2019 surprise one in three (14 million) were taking steps to manage or stop drinking.\nA small but significant proportion (6%) said they had stopped drinking entirely, according to the Opinium survey of more than 2,000 adults for the charity Alcohol Change UK.\nAn example of the pressure of lockdown on those struggling to maintain their alcohol recovery was \u201cLizzie\u201d, one of the charity\u2019s clients and the mother of a young child, who has managed to remain alcohol-free after a \u201cdry January\u201d.\n\u201cSince lockdown things have been harder,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had to stop my therapy sessions, and there have been a couple times I have thought, \u2018I could just drink that whole bottle of Prosecco that\u2019s still hanging around from Christmas.\u2019\n\u201cEverywhere online people are talking about drinking to respond to our current situation and honestly it breaks my heart, because I don\u2019t want to be numb anymore.\u201d\nMeanwhile, some 3.5 million adults are living in households where alcohol is leading to greater conflict during the lockdown, the researchers found. Of that group, one in seven people with children under 18 reported that alcohol had led to increased tensions.\nOther trends included the emergence of drink-free days, adopted by 14% of people. The Guardian reported last week that the coronavirus lockdown had led to a mushrooming of online support groups for people coping with drink problems, with organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous having to deal with meetings being hijacked by trolls.\nThe Opinium survey, carried out from 8 to 14 April, found that the people who had cut down the most had not been drinking much anyway. Nearly half (47%) of people who drank once a week or less have cut down or stopped consuming alcohol, compared with just over a quarter (27%) of people who drank two to six times a week, and just one in five (17%) of daily drinkers.\nNearly one in five (18%) of daily drinkers have increased the amount they drink.\nProf Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said it was good news that many people were taking their health seriously during the pandemic by reducing their alcohol consumption, something strongly recommended by the World Health Organization.\n\u201cCutting down on alcohol will not only improve our own health but it will help to protect the NHS long term, and so it is important that these healthy trends continue,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat said, lockdown will be a difficult experience for many dependent drinkers, those in recovery, or those whose alcohol consumption has risen sharply in the last few weeks.\u201d",

        "content": "The president attacked those who favored China, including the WHO, for which he previously announced a hold on funding\nDonald Trump has fuelled a media theory that the coronavirus pandemic began when the pathogen accidentally escaped a Chinese laboratory, teasing that \u201cmore and more we\u2019re hearing the story\u201d.\nThe US president\u2019s TV network of choice, Fox News, has reported that \u201cmultiple sources\u201d in the American government believe initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human in a virology lab in Wuhan. Due to weak safety protocols, an infected lab worker then went to a wet market where the virus spread.\nWhen the Fox News reporter John Roberts put this to Trump at a press briefing on Wednesday, he replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to say that, John, but I will tell you more and more we\u2019re hearing the story.\u201d\nThe president is notorious for recycling content from Fox News in his remarks or tweets, and it was unclear whether he was privy to any other information to back the claim. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. When you say \u2018multiple sources\u2019, now there\u2019s a case where you can use the word \u2018sources\u2019. But we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened.\u201d\nTrump added that he did not want to disclose any discussions he had with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about the laboratory.\nThe Pentagon\u2019s top general, Mark Milley, cast doubt on the lab theory earlier this week, saying that US intelligence has looked into the possibility but that the \u201cweight of evidence\u201d thus far pointed towards \u201cnatural\u201d origins.\nSince the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan in December, more extreme conspiracy theories have suggested that it was engineered as a bioweapon. There is no evidence for this. The scientific journal the Lancet has stated the virus appears to have come from wildlife. An analysis by scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology suggests that the virus\u2019s genome is 96% similar to a coronavirus found in bats.\nBut the story running prominently on Fox News begins by stating the virus began \u201cnot as a bioweapon\u201d, alleging incompetence rather than a malicious attack. This idea has gained more traction, especially among anti-China hardliners in Washington.\nOn Tuesday the Washington Post reported that state department cables had warned two years ago of safety issues at a Wuhan lab studying bat coronaviruses. The Post said: \u201cThe cables have fueled discussions inside the US government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus \u2013 even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.\u201d\nChina\u2019s extreme censorship and lack of openness about the virus have done little to quell the speculation. But conversely, healthy scepticism is guaranteed because of Fox News\u2019 widely panned coverage of the pandemic as well as Trump\u2019s habit of searching for distractions and excuses to shift blame.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing, he lambasted the Voice of America radio station for its China coverage \u2013 \u201cwhat things they say are disgusting toward our country\u201d \u2013 and the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving Beijing the benefit of the doubt.\n\u201cIt took them a long time to realise what was going on, but I have a feeling they knew exactly what was going on,\u201d he said without evidence, having previously announced a hold on WHO funding. \u201cTragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn\u2019t do any formal [travel] ban.\u201d\nMeanwhile Trump, under pressure to restart the economy, struck an optimistic note for America\u2019s fight against the virus on a cold day in the White House rose garden. \u201cThe battle continues but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases,\u201d he said, without giving details to support the claim. \u201cHopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress.\n\u201cThese encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalise guidelines on states for reopening the country.\u201d\nThe White House will release the guidelines on Thursday, he added, after he and Vice-President Mike Pence hold calls with governors. \u201cWe think that some states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be the comeback kids \u2013 all of us \u2026 Tomorrow\u2019s going to be a very big day \u2026 We\u2019ll have some openings that will exceed our expectations. And they\u2019ll be safe, they\u2019ll be strong, but we want to get our country back. We\u2019re going to do it, and we\u2019re gonna do it soon.\u201d\nThe reopenings are bound to be phased geographically and require flexibility. Pence, who heads the coronavirus taskforce, said: \u201cThe American people will be encouraged to know as we stand here today, 24% of the counties of this country have no reported coronavirus cases. In fact, half of the states in America have less than 2,500 cases per state.\u201d\nBut public health experts have warned that the US, which has the biggest caseload in the world, must boost testing and contact tracing before loosening restrictions. Trump said the US has surpassed 3.3m completed tests but failed to answer governors\u2019 concerns over how the process can be stepped up.\nIn an unexpected turn, he also threatened to force Congress into a formal recess so that he can make recess appointments of federal officials, including judges. He falsely accused Democrats of leaving key administration positions unstaffed and making it \u201cvery hard\u201d to govern.\n\u201cWe have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government and now more so than ever before because of the virus \u2026 If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cThe current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro-forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis.\u201d\nMichael Beschloss, an author and historian, tweeted: \u201cNo President in history has ever used the Constitutional power to adjourn Congress ... Wilson, Taft and FDR were all urged to adjourn Congress and all refused.\u201d",

        "content": "Groups such as Isis plan to exploit pandemic, but even it has acknowledged danger posed by virus\nIslamic extremists hope to exploit the Covid-19 pandemic to launch new attacks, motivate followers and reinforce their credentials as alternative rulers of swaths of unstable countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.\nBut the responses of different extremist groups have differed. While Islamic State has told its members to launch attacks against weakened and distracted western nations, the Taliban have released images of its public health teams, for example.\nExperts say the reaction to the pandemic has also evolved within extremist organisations, as its scale and threat has become better known.\nInitially, Isis gloated over Covid-19 in its magazine, al-Naba, describing the virus as a punishment for \u201cCrusader nations\u201d, and calling for strikes against the west as it reeled from the pandemic. However, more recent editions of the publication have carried lengthy articles saying it would be wrong for Muslims to believe they would be spared by the disease.\nThough editorials have continued to blame the US for a wave of atheism and immorality that has allegedly provoked punishment in the form of the pandemic, one al-Naba author stressed that similar outbreaks in the past had hit both the faithful and non-Muslims alike.\n\u201cThey are saying that the pandemic is definitely God\u2019s will but the intention behind it is unclear, so Muslims need to repent and \u2026 take measures not to catch or transmit [the virus],\u201d said Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a researcher at the Program on Extremism at the George Washington University.\n\u201cIsis is recommending various health guidelines to its members and supporters \u2026 [and] also encouraging them to not show mercy to the western countries \u2026 but rather to continue to attack them, and exploit their weaknesses in these times.\u201d\nThough the group has recommended that members do not travel to western countries to launch attacks, it has said that those already present should act. On Wednesday, German police arrested four suspected members alleged to be planning to bomb US military facilities.\nProsecutors said the men joined Isis in January 2019 and were instructed to form a cell in Germany. Their alleged targets included US air force bases in the country and individuals deemed critical of Islam.\nIn contrast, al-Qaida issued six pages of advice and commentary on Covid-19 last week, arguing that though the virus had cast \u201ca gloomy, painful shadow over the entire world\u201d, the arrival of the pandemic in the Muslim world was a consequence of \u201cour own sins and \u2026 the obscenity and moral corruption \u2026 widespread in Muslim countries\u201d.\nThe group, which has not launched attacks in the west for more than a decade, said the crisis was an opportunity \u201cto spread the correct creed, call people to jihad in the way of Allah and revolt against oppression and oppressors\u201d.\nThere are concerns the Coronavirus crisis could provide an opportunity for Islamic militants to win support as corrupt, inefficient and poorly resourced governments across Africa and the Middle East fail to provide adequate care for already distrustful populations. Islamist groups have repeatedly sought to exploit natural disasters in the past.\nFew countries hit badly by extremism have effective health systems and, though the full extent of the spread of the disease is difficult to gauge, many are likely to suffer acutely from the virus in coming weeks and months.\nRefugees and detainees \u2013 two communities already vulnerable to extremist recruitment \u2013 are particularly exposed to the new disease. Isis has recognised this, calling on fighters to make extra efforts to liberate imprisoned members of the group.\nIn Somalia, al-Shabaab held an urgent meeting two weeks ago to discuss the threat of the epidemic where senior commanders decided to tell Muslims to take precautions against the disease.\nAl-Shabaab, which controls swaths of territory and is fighting local government forces backed by US airstrikes and other African troops, blamed the disease on \u201cthe crusader forces who have invaded the country and the disbelieving countries that support them\u201d.\nAn al-Shabaab leader said the group rejoiced in the suffering of the US and its European allies.\n\u201cCoronavirus has uncovered the weakness of those who claimed to be superpowers such US, France, Italy, Germany and Britain,\u201d Fu\u2019ad Mohamed Khalaf told a congregation in a mosque in an al-Shabaab-controlled area of southern Somalia, according to the group\u2019s news channels.\nA spokesman for the group said it was too soon to comment on whether the group would heed a UN plea for a ceasefire or whether it would allow health workers to access areas it controlled.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban have said they will assist any humanitarian organisation that is helping victims of the virus or helping to stop its spread, and in some parts of the country have offered to cooperate with local authorities.\nThe Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed told the Associated Press news agency: \u201cIf, God forbid, the outbreak happens in an area where we control the situation, then we can stop fighting in that area.\u201d\nThe movement has also distributed images of Taliban medics distributing soap, masks and gloves in the eastern province of Nangarhar, and lecturing community leaders on precautions to stop the spread of the disease.\nThose groups that have shown little interest in winning the support of local communities are often those that have taken the hardest line.\nAbubakar Shekau, the leader of the Boko Haram breakaway faction of extremists in Nigeria, released an audio clip this week claiming that his brutal version of Islam was an \u201canti-virus\u201d and portraying social distancing measures that have closed mosques as an assault on the faith.\nAs well as providing an opportunity for militants, the pandemic may undermine the international effort against Islamist extremism, some experts say.\n\u201cIt is almost certainly correct that Covid-19 will handicap domestic security efforts and international counter-Isis cooperation, allowing the jihadists to better prepare spectacular terror attacks,\u201d the International Crisis Group said.\nThough analysts said it was too soon to point to attacks that could be blamed specifically on militants exploiting the coronavirus, Islamist extremists in late March carried out their deadliest assault yet against the military of Chad, a significant contributor to Africa\u2019s growing counterterrorism efforts. At least 92 soldiers were killed near the border with Nigeria and Niger.\nFighters affiliated to al-Qaida killed 29 soldiers in Mali on 19 March. An Islamist extremist group in northern Mozambique has also launched a series of attacks of unprecedented scale in recent weeks, while on Tuesday, a police officer and seven suspected militants were killed in an exchange of gunfire in central Cairo.\nIraq, where the pandemic has prompted the US-led coalition to halt training activities amid a planned pullout from several bases, has seen a surge in attacks by Isis in the last week.\nThere are signs elsewhere that the militaries of the US, Britain and other countries are also pulling back because of the virus, leaving a possible opening for the extremists.\nIn March, the US Africa Command cancelled two major exercises with African allies \u201cfor force protection considerations\u201d. African military units, already stretched thin, are likely to take protective measures as the virus threatens their ranks.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

The markets have come under extra scrutiny following the coronavirus outbreak.\nWhile supermarkets selling chilled or frozen meats are increasingly popular in Asia, older shoppers generally prefer buying freshly slaughtered meat for daily consumption, believing it produces flavour in dishes and soup that is superior to frozen meat. Slabs of beef and pork hang from the butchers\u2019 stalls while various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies. After widespread avian flu outbreaks in the late 1990s however, Hong Kong and many Chinese provinces have banned the sale of live poultry in markets.\nWhile \u201cwet markets\u201d, where water is sloshed on produce to keep it cool and fresh, may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most do not trade in exotic or wild animals and should not be confused with \u201cwildlife markets\u201d \u2013 now the focus of vociferous calls for global bans.\nThe now-infamous Wuhan South China seafood market, suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 in late 2019, had a wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were for sale, including snakes, beavers, badgers, civet cats, foxes, peacocks and porcupines among other animals.\nThe Wuhan market was closed in January and the Chinese authorities placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife. But according to recent news reports, some wildlife markets in southern China have reopened amid the pandemic, selling dogs, cats, bats, lizards and scorpions among other species.\nMany Chinese continue to believe in the health benefits of consuming meat from wild animals. Two leading Hong Kong microbiologists, Professor Yuen Kwok-yung and Dr David Lung, last month condemned the continuing practice of consuming wild game, warning that \u201cSars 3.0\u201d could materialise if people do not refrain from eating wild animals.",

In fact, its cult status is on the rise. Despite having been primetime Friday-night viewing for seven years, The Golden Girls does not currently have the binge-watching availability of, say, Friends, because it is not available on streaming platforms such as Netflix (although you can buy past series on iTunes and Amazon).\nInstead, the current influx of fans get their fix via Instagram, where Golden Girls has been hash-tagged more than 600,000 times on accounts such as Golden Girls Daily and Golden Girls Love, which are approaching 50,000 followers each. Some episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, and the revival took a further step into the mainstream when Golden Girls backgrounds were recently made available for the video conferencing app Zoom.\nYou can also buy Golden Girls-themed everything, from Monopoly, Cluedo and Trivial Pursuit, to Pez dispensers, action figures and even breakfast cereal. There are 11,000 Golden Girls products available on Redbubble.com alone. In 2016, Ryan Reynolds paid $10,000 to the estate of Bea Arthur to wear the actor\u2019s likeness on a vest in the Deadpool movie, and the ladies have shown up in modern children\u2019s cartoons, including Teen Titans GO! (\u201cThat ring can manifest any weapon imaginable and you choose The Golden Girls?\u201d) and The Amazing World of Gumball.\nIn uncertain times there is something comforting about The Golden Girls. Of course, at times it is hideously dated and it\u2019s fuzzy as hell, but the jokes are surprisingly fresh, the politics progressive and, bear with me here, the fashion is actually more wearable than you might imagine. Check out some enduring trends showcased by each of Miami\u2019s feistiest citizens.\nSouthern belle Blanche was the good time Girl. She craved attention and she sure got it, with a wardrobe of custom gowns, pant suits and nightwear \u2013 well, she did spend a lot of time in bed. Blanche knew that a well-cut blazer could pull any look together, and that shoulder pads had a way of balancing things out \u2013 which is just as well, with hair so teased and bouffed. As the youngest of the group, the museum assistant was comfortable in casual looks, wearing jeans and giving sportswear a touch of luxe decades before athleisure became a thing. Rue McClanahan was contractually allowed to keep all of her character\u2019s custom-made clothes, which reportedly filled 13 closets.\nRose is a kind-hearted country girl and her wardrobe exudes a down-to-earth simplicity and charm. As a grief counsellor, Rose\u2019s look was warm and approachable \u2013 hence her collection of comedy jumpers. Statement sweaters are serious business on today\u2019s catwalks and it\u2019s easy to imagine Rose (played by Betty White) in a cute Iceberg pullover or Ralph Lauren teddy bear knit.

Substitute teacher Dorothy was a no-nonsense character favouring tailored neutrals and layered looks with 20s-inspired drop-waists, duster coats and tunics with wide-legged palazzo pants \u2013 still a summer staple. She never wore heels, preferring slouchy boots or sandals, because the actor Bea Arthur hated wearing shoes.\nPicture it: Shady Pines retirement home, 1985, a poor, widowed woman flees a terrible fire with nothing more than bifocals and a clunky wicker handbag.

        "content": "Prime minister gives no timetable for move to Australia-like restrictions but warns against complacency\nJacinda Ardern has pledged elimination of Covid-19 from the country as her government\u2019s goal, as she foreshadowed a modest loosening of the restrictions that have kept New Zealanders at home for much of the past month.\nThe country is likely to face weeks more of tight control on recreational and business activities as officials attempt to stamp out the virus in a state the prime minister described as a \u201crecovery room\u201d.\nBut Ardern \u2013 who has not yet decided when the lower tier of rules would be implemented \u2013 warned against complacency, urging the country to act as \u201ca team of five million looking after each other\u201d. Most people would still be required to stay at home most of the time under the new rules.\nIn March the government implemented a four-tier alert system, which is set at the highest level until Wednesday. Ardern will announce on Monday whether the country will drop to level three. At a news conference on Thursday, she revealed for the first time what that would look like.\nTakeaway meals and food delivery would be allowed again and people could once again see partners who did not live with them, or bring an \u201cexclusive\u201d number of others, such a single person, relative or caregiver for their children into their household \u201cbubble\u201d. That would bring New Zealand into line with measures imposed in Australia.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\nShops would remain closed, except for those selling essential goods, but they could make sales online. Cafes, bars, restaurants, shopping malls and playgrounds must stay shut.\nWeddings, funerals and tangi \u2013 M\u0101ori funeral services \u2013 would be permitted under the level three rules with fewer than 10 guests and no food or meals served.\nSchools and early childcare centres would be permitted to reopen up to year 10, or approximately 14-year-old students. Older teenagers could remain at home to study unsupervised, and school attendance for all students would be optional.\nArdern described the moves as a \u201ccautious\u201d reopening of the economy. She said all those who could work from home must continue to do so, and those who could not \u2013 such as tradespeople \u2013 must be able to observe physical distancing and other safety measures if their businesses were to reopen.\nNew Zealanders have so far been asked to stay in their neighbourhoods \u2013 a rule that has been challenged by those wanting clearer guidelines on how far they could travel. A move to level three would require them only to stay within their city or region. A handful of recreational activities banned under level four \u2013 such as swimming, surfing and fishing from shore \u2013 would be allowed.\nBut activities must be kept \u201clow risk\u201d, Ardern said, and level three would not be \u201cthe time to take up a new activity that you have never done before\u201d, nor an invitation to congregate in public places.\n\u201cKeep it exclusive ... keep it small,\u201d she said.\nThe new restrictions are expected to be in place for weeks before the government considers easing to much looser level two rules.\nNew Zealand has drawn global praise for its swift response to the spread of the virus, moving to a strict national lockdown before any deaths were recorded due to Covid-19. The national death toll now stands at nine. More people have recovered from the virus than there are active cases of the disease.\nBut Ardern urged New Zealanders to \u201ccontinue to act like you have Covid \u2026 and act like people around you have it too\u201d. There would be \u201ca high level of trust and responsibility\u201d along with extra risk under level three restrictions.\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is move out of level four and lose everything,\u201d she said.",

Fortunately, there are video games offering beautiful landscapes where you can lose yourself in (virtual) nature. You\u2019re in good company if you do \u2013 as film and media professor Alenda Chang points out in her book, Playing Nature: \u201cFor many people, the hours spent in game environments vastly outnumber those spent in wilderness areas\u201d, even without a public health crisis.\nReplaying favourite games for comfort is a trend now, and some are revisiting recent open-world adventures, such as Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Horizon Zero Dawn, and even Far Cry 5 with the guns put away. But these blockbuster action games tend to feature enemies \u2014not ideal if all you want is a peaceful ramble around a beautiful place.\nLuckily, there\u2019s a genre of video games called walking simulators, where the goal is simply to wander around an unknown space. Many of the best-known walking sims take place in confined indoor spaces (if you haven\u2019t already, you need to try Gone Home, The Stanley Parable and What Remains of Edith Finch), but there are plenty that offer broad, natural landscapes to explore (Firewatch, Abz\u00fb, and Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture are great examples, and great worlds to wander). For some recent and unequivocally comforting virtual walks \u2013 all friendly to first-time players \u2013 try one of these.\nYou\u2019re a cute teenage bird visiting Aunt May in her seaside village. But mobile reception is nonexistent, so you hike up a mountain to try and find some. At your own pace, you can chat with neighbours, collect shiny things, and hike, swim and fly up to Hawk Peak. The in-game hiking trails make this a perfect outdoor escape from being cooped up inside.\n Adamgryu, 2019; PC/Mac, \u00a35\nThe dappled air of Eastshade sparkles, beckoning you into villages brimming with cosy cheer. You\u2019re a traveling painter whose commissions take you to all corners of the island: windmill-covered cliffs, balloon rides to snow-capped mountaintops, ancient forest paths that lead to the beach. There\u2019s golden light, supernaturally beautiful eclipses once a day, and low-pressure tasks assigned by kind anthropomorphic creatures. Playing Eastshade feels like the loveliest respite for anyone who dreams of travelling to a faraway land to drink tea and pursue creative passions. \n Eastshade Studios, 2019; PC, PS4, Xbox One, \u00a320\nYou\u2019re a lost soul inhabiting the body of one animal after another, traversing a post-human world long after those inhabitants have disappeared. You were once one of them. Sometimes, as you come across the shadows of your family and friends, bits of your past return to you. While the story gradually takes shape, the most fun is in gasping at the gorgeous vistas and switching perspectives from majestic wolf to darting fish to adorably rotund wombat. Each animal\u2019s capabilities show you new ways to explore the flourishing ecospheres, none of which you\u2019ll want to leave. \n Mooneye Studios, 2019; PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, \u00a326\nThis new idle/adventure game is dark in tone but the poignant concept and cosy execution make it worth exploring. Far beneath the ground lives a king who plans to sleep for 400 days \u2013 real days, which will pass whether or not you\u2019re playing. In a plea all too relevant, all the king asks of you \u201cis to wait and never to leave these caves\u201d. With that, Shade, your elf-like character, begins the lonely vigil, trudging around the vast underground network to find small treasures. Time becomes a landscape and waiting your tool of exploration, as days and weeks of actual time must pass before you can continue some excursions. As it passes, Shade begins to feel like your friend, as small footsteps patter around in a background window of your computer. They could really use a friend to pass the time with \u2013 who couldn\u2019t. \n Studio Seufz, 2020; PC/Mac, \u00a312\nGo the woods and play in this contemplative adaptation of Henry David Thoreau\u2019s masterpiece.

So far 149 crew have tested positive from approximately 300 tests.\nDean Summers from the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation said it was hypocritical not to provide 100% testing on the ship, which is docked in Port Kembla, as the NSW government rolled out mass testing in other parts of the state.\nNSW Health has increased testing in various suburbs with high coronavirus rates, installing a mobile testing clinic at Bondi beach. On Wednesday the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told residents of those suburbs: \u201cIf you have any symptoms, please come forward and get tested.\u201d On Thursday the NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said the state was moving towards anyone with mild symptoms being eligible for testing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse,\u201d Summers told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. \u201cThey can\u2019t explain it. That is counter to what every single person and health professional in the world is telling us.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they have mobile clinics in Bondi and all around the metropolitan area, but when it comes to these poor buggers they forget about them.\u201d\nA spokesman for the private company tasked with providing medical services on the ship, Aspen Medical, said it could only test those approved by NSW Health.\nOn Thursday NSW Health said testing would be carried out for all crew over the next 48 hours.\nA spokesman said crew members who were asymptomatic had not been tested previously because that \u201ccan often lead to false negative results\u201d. But that would now be changed to test everyone.\n\u201cCrew members have been tested progressively, beginning with those who first developed symptoms,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cTesting on people with no symptoms of Covid-19 can often lead to false negative results. For this reason, NSW Health only tests people with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, a dry cough or other respiratory symptoms.\n\u201c[But] in order to gain a better understanding of whether crew were developing immunity, we have expanded testing. Over the next 48 hours we expect all crew who have yet to be tested \u2013 as they are currently asymptomatic \u2013 to have been tested for Covid-19.\n\u201cSo far 149 crew on board the Ruby Princess have tested positive for Covid-19 and a further 11 crew members are in NSW health facilities with Covid-19. While the epidemiological evidence indicates there has been transmission of the virus on the vessel, this appears to have slowed.\u201d\nOn Wednesday the South Australian chief public health officer, Dr Nicola Spurrier, said anyone in that state with even \u201cmild symptoms\u201d would be able to be tested.\nThe NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said he was \u201cworking towards\u201d a \u201chopeful departure date\u201d of Sunday for the Ruby Princess.\nSummers said Australia had a legal and humanitarian obligation to help crew members, who are in quarantine in their cabins, by testing them, treating them and allowing them to return to their home countries.\nHe said the operator of the Ruby Princess, Carnival Cruises, had confirmed it was willing to pay for the costs of repatriation.\n\u201cSome people have been locked down since the 20th of April,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are terrified. Some crew are absolutely beside themselves, and their families writing to me from all over the world.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nHe said the Uruguayan government had helped 112 Australians and New Zealanders who were stranded on the Greg Mortimer cruise ship. Those passengers were evacuated from Montevideo and arrived in Melbourne on Sunday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s achievable,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThe South Americans did it for us a couple of days ago. That\u2019s the way the Uruguayans treat our people. And how do we treat their people? We lock them up for 30 days.\u201d\nThe NSW government has announced a special commission of inquiry into the docking of the Ruby Princess, led by the barrister Bret Walker SC, and NSW police are also conducting an investigation.\nPrincess Cruises took out a full-page newspaper advertisement on Thursday saying it would support all inquiries.",

They include satirical social media posts, opposition to the university\u2019s contract with the Confucius Institute, and comments critical of the vice-chancellor, Peter H\u00f8j.\nGuardian Australia has reviewed a summary of the \u201cmisconduct\u201d charges, which include claims his conduct was inappropriate and abusive, and that he damaged the reputation of the university. None suggest he has acted unlawfully.\nLast year, after helping to organise a protest in support of the Hong Kong independence movement, Pavlou was assaulted in the university grounds by a group of pro-China protesters who gatecrashed the event.\nPavlou subsequently sought a court order, similar to a restraining order, against the Chinese consul general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, who he claims endangered him by praising the \u201cself-motivated patriotic behaviour\u201d of the counter-protesters and, in effect, accusing Pavlou of \u201canti-China separatist activities\u201d. That case is ongoing.\nXu is an adjunct professor at the university.\nThe university has a long history of fostering activists, including many of those who protested against the 1971 Springbok tour, and others who would become prominent political figures in Queensland.\nIn a statement on Pavlou, UQ said: \u201cUniversities reasonably expect that students comply with conduct policies and charters that reflect both the organisation\u2019s values and community expectations.\n\u201cUQ\u2019s disciplinary processes seek to address alleged contraventions of university policy \u2013 they do not seek to prevent students from expressing their views or to limit their right to freedom of speech.\n\u201cIt would not be appropriate for the university to comment on the specifics of this disciplinary matter. However, the university rejects Mr Pavlou\u2019s statement that the university\u2019s process is an attempt to penalise him for airing his political beliefs.\u201d",

Federal and local governments, health insurers and employers have pledged to help Americans pay their way through this crisis, but to do so requires a dramatic overhaul of a system which has for decades prioritized cost over care.\n\u201cAs this epidemic makes clear, at any moment, any of us could become sick, could become hospitalized, could be on a mechanical ventilator,\u201d said Adam Gaffney, an ICU doctor in Boston. \u201cAnd that, in the United States, could mean potentially ruinous healthcare costs.\u201d\nGaffney is president of Physicians for a National Health Plan, a group of more than 20,000 medical professionals who support universal healthcare in the US. PNHP members see first hand the consequences of people being forced to make medical decisions based on cost.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from patients saying they\u2019ve skipped their inhaler because they couldn\u2019t afford the dose,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from patients who\u2019ve gone for years without primary care because they were uninsured and wound up in the ICU.\u201d\nThere were 27.9 million people without health insurance in 2018 and that figure is projected to increase by millions because of record-high unemployment. In the meantime the US has 639,000-plus detected coronavirus cases and more than 30,900 deaths, the true numbers will be far higher.\nThe US government and major health insurers said they are covering the costs of Covid-19 testing and treatment, but fear of bankrupting costs and the byzantine complexities of the system leave unanswered questions about whether people will even seek care, let alone escape a potentially crippling medical bill weeks or months later.\nHow much testing and treatment costs individuals depends on if the patient was insured, how they were insured, and whether they survived. For example, a company that pays for its staff\u2019s health insurance could decide not to cover an employee\u2019s treatment, even if the health insurance company it\u2019s using had said it would waive Covid-19 related payments.\nAnd simply overcoming the American instinct to question how much medical treatment costs is a hurdle in the pandemic.\nSince 2006, 30% of Americans each year on average have delayed any sort of medical treatment for cost, according to the polling firm Gallup. In that time, 19% of Americans each year on average have delayed treatment for a serious condition, according to Gallup\u2019s December 2019 report.\nMore Americans are afraid of paying for healthcare if they became seriously ill (40%) than are afraid of getting seriously ill (33%), according to a 2018 poll by the University of Chicago and the West Health Institute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fight an epidemic if people are afraid to go to the doctor, to be seen in the emergency room,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cIt could mean some people not getting tested, it could mean some people delaying getting care and potentially harming their own health.\u201d\nThe pandemic crisis is being further exacerbated by the system\u2019s devotion to profits over people. Medical workers are being furloughed and losing jobs because of the pandemic \u2013 including those on the frontlines \u2013 as their employers seek to cut costs.\nAlteon Health, a private-equity backed company which employs about 1,700 emergency medicine doctors and other physicians, said it would temporarily stop providing benefits including paid time off, according to the health website STAT.\nWhile intensive care units and emergency rooms are billing sky-high figures, there has been a pause on non-essential care that has, in turn, cut medical system profits.\nWithout high-margin treatments such as physical therapy, cosmetic surgery and orthopedic procedures, medical systems are struggling to pay salaries and cover administrative costs.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians projected 60,000 family practices will close or significantly scale back by June and 800,000 of their employees will be laid off, furloughed or have their hours reduced.\nAnd in hospital corridors across the country, staff aren\u2019t just extra mindful of a dry cough and high temperature, but also that their salaries and work equipment are dependent on the bottom line.\nJoe Maginn, an ER nurse in Madison, Wisconsin, said: \u201cThe bottom line has always been very forefront and this now puts into an extra level of being conscious on our mind to not waste money.\u201d\nMaginn and his wife, who is also a healthcare worker, are on alert for their own healthcare costs.\n\u201cIf we do get sick and need to be hospitalized, it hits us financially with the insurance and those kinds of payments, but it also hits us financially because we\u2019re not able to work any longer,\u201d Maginn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy for the healthcare workers doing this right now.\u201d\nHis health insurance, which also covers their three children, costs $5,000 a year plus the money they set aside for out-of-pocket costs in a tax-free account.\n\u201cWe work for the hospital, it should be that we would have the most access to it [healthcare], but unfortunately yeah, that\u2019s not how our country is set up.\u201d\nCongress has allocated $100bn to help hospitals. On Friday, the White House said hospitals that accept the funds will not be allowed to use two common billing practices: to bill uninsured patients or bill them for getting care from a doctor who is at the hospital, but not directly employed by it.\nLike other parts of the planned government response, questions remain about just how effective that money will be in addressing the convoluted healthcare landscape and if it will arrive in time to save jobs and clinics.\nThis major disruption to the US healthcare system may leave nurses and doctors jobless, but there are early indications insurance companies could be insulated from the damage.\nNot only did health insurance companies enter the crisis with capital, several analysts have anticipated these companies could have lower costs because fewer people are seeking routine medical care.\nDavid Blumenthal, president of the global health thinktank the Commonwealth Fund, said people who have coverage year-round will still be paying premiums, while insurers have fewer procedures to cover.\n\u201cWe will continue to pay our premiums, because we know that we could get coronavirus and end up in the intensive care unit and have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars if we don\u2019t have insurance,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep paying, but we\u2019re not going to the doctor unless we absolutely need to. So that\u2019s all good news for insurance companies.\u201d\nAt the same time, the 16 million people who have lost their jobs in the past three weeks will put an increased burden on the healthcare system if they join the ranks of the uninsured or those who use Medicaid, government health insurance for low-income people.\nBlumenthal said there were also knock-on health effects to the economic crisis, such as depression from income loss and malnutrition, which would make people more susceptible to illness.\nBenjamin Sommers, professor of health policy and economics at Harvard TH Chan school of public health said there are few signs the pandemic is driving the Trump administration to reflect on the healthcare system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see where the public ends up settling on in terms of what it demands from public officials in response to this epidemic,\u201d said Sommers, a practicing primary care physician.\nThe ICU doctor, Gaffney, said he was certain the way healthcare is financed in the US is exacerbating the overall harm of the epidemic.\n\u201cAt a time of soaring unemployment and at a time of deepening recession, people are going to be losing coverage and seeing more and more medical bills if they get sick,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",

It would access the government\u2019s jobkeeper scheme for eligible employees, it said. The chief executive, Matt Bekier, had taken a 40% pay cut and directors had cut their fees by 50%.\nCrown announced on Thursday it had lined up facilities with its banks for a total of $560m and had agreed terms with the three banks funding the construction of its Barangaroo project to allow building to continue.\n\u201cThis facility [for $450m] remains subject to final credit approvals and long-form documentation,\u201d Crown said.\nIt said its current cash balance of \u201capproximately $500m, together with its ability to secure over $1bn in additional debt facilities\u201d, reflected \u201cCrown\u2019s strong financial position\u201d during the period of disruption. It did not provide estimates of how long its cash would last.\nCrown has now stood down about 95% or more than 11,500 of its employees. \u201cOnly employees in business-critical functions remain actively working,\u201d the company said.\nEx-gratia payments of two weeks\u2019 pay were given to those full-time and part-time employees, while casuals were given a lump sum payment of $1,000. Staff were also allowed to draw down on existing annual and long-service leave.\nCrown\u2019s chief executive, Ken Barton, and the board have taken 20% cuts to their remuneration.\nIncluding the new facility, the Star said it had available cash and undrawn debt facilities of $700m. That, it said, would provide sufficient liquidity for an extended period of shutdown.\nUnlike Crown, Star provided estimates of the rate it would burn through cash, saying it would need about $220m in total under a three-month shutdown to 30 June and $320m in total under a six-month shutdown to 30 September.\nThose estimates include operating expenses, drawdowns by employees on accrued annual and long-service leave entitlements, payables offset by receivables, interest payments, and capital expenditure payments, Star said.\nStar\u2019s expansion plans were at a much earlier stage. Crown, however, is midway through the construction of its $2.2bn high-roller casino and apartment block at Barangaroo, which is designed to cater to VIP gamblers from China. Many of the luxury units have also been sold to offshore investors.\n\u201cCrown intends to continue construction of the Crown Sydney project as planned and, absent any further delays arising from the impact of Covid-19, remains on track for completion of the Crown Sydney hotel resort by the end of the year,\u201d Crown said in the statement to the ASX\nA slowdown or halting of major construction projects would be a further blow to the Australian economy.\n\u201cCurrently, there are over 1,300 people employed on the construction of Crown Sydney, which is expected to be maintained until completion,\u201d the company said. \u201cIn the lead-up to the full opening of Crown Sydney, Crown expects to recruit over 2,000 people to work in the hotel resort.\u201d",

The reporter, now the chief political correspondent for the Herald and the Age, does not dispute Turnbull\u2019s account.\nTurnbull writes that the \u201cprivileged access\u201d News Corp had under Abbott wasn\u2019t going to continue under his leadership, after he succeeded in challenging Abbott in 2015.\n\u201cWith Abbott they had a deferential prime minister they thought they controlled,\u201d he writes.\nHe says he was attacked relentlessly by the company\u2019s rightwing columnists and, when Sky News employed Credlin, they gave a \u201cpowerful platform to a vindictive, vengeful enemy of my government\u201d.\nTurnbull says he discussed the \u201cvicious personal partisanship\u201d of the Australian and Sky News with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch many times but they minimised it by claiming the outlets were not influential because they had small audiences.\nHe said the 2GB broadcasters Alan Jones and Ray Hadley \u2013 full of \u201cvanity and megalomania\u201d \u2013 loved to berate and bully politicians like him who weren\u2019t \u201cin their pocket\u201d.\nUnder his leadership, Turnbull says, Morrison was constantly briefing Benson, liked to keep himself \u201cconstantly in the centre of things\u201d and used leaks to pre-empt government decisions.\nThe former prime minister believes Murdoch wanted him to win the 2016 election because his prime ministership was better than a Labor government but Credlin and Sky News were relentless critics and the corporation eventually \u201cbought into the Abbott madness of destroying the government to bring about its defeat so that Tony could come back as leader in opposition before returning to government in 2022\u201d.\nCredlin said apart from flashes of brilliance Turnbull had no work ethic and had the wrong temperament for politics.\n\u201cHe has no moral compass,\u201d she told 2GB. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a more reprehensible human being.\u201d\nTurnbull is also critical of the way News Corp newspapers undermined efforts to combat climate change, in particular during the summer bushfires when they mocked Greta Thunberg.\n\u201cAs we reflect on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s achievements, we have to ask, what good has he done apart from making himself and his family rich?\n\u201cHis media have championed climate change denial relentlessly, and played a very influential role in the lack of climate action in our country and in the United States especially.\u201d\nTurnbull says on an international scale the Murdochs \u201croutinely exploit and encourage intolerance and racial and religious animosities\u201d and are the \u201cfiercest defenders of Trump\u201d and \u201ckeenest promoters of Brexit\u201d. Outlets including Fox News must take much of the blame for the US being a divided, inward-turning nation today, he says.",

Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of unbreakable employment contracts, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.\nIn Lebanon, where an economic meltdown had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organization fear many domestic workers are no longer being paid. There are concerns that, with families confined to homes, workers have been forced into more intensive and dangerous work, facing obsessive demands to clean inside homes and dangerous xenophobia on rare trips outside.\n\u201cAs one of the most marginalised groups in Lebanon, the government needs to clearly warn that it will prosecute employers who exploit or abuse migrant domestic workers. It should also ensure they are granted access to healthcare during the pandemic,\u201d said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director.\nIn Lebanon, the 250,000-strong migrant workforce consists primarily of domestic workers, who usually live in the homes of their employers.\nIn the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where foreign workers make up 90% of the population of the United Arab Emirates, 60% in Kuwait, 50% in Bahrain, and 33% in Saudi Arabia, large numbers of migrant workers are instead housed in labour camps. Many have been stood down since the coronavirus outbreak, and can neither depart for their home countries, nor leave their compounds. Social distancing is very difficult and access to advanced healthcare is often limited.\nWhile official coronavirus numbers in the Gulf states are relatively low compared with Iran, the region\u2019s most seriously affected country, there are concerns that migrant camps are dangerous incubators for the virus, and are not adequately checked by authorities who give precedence to citizens and expatriate residents.\nWhen the region\u2019s airports eventually open, potentially by the end of Ramadan in late May, some GCC countries are expecting laid-off skilled and unskilled workers to leave in numbers if they can still afford to do so.\nIn the meantime, several million others face what NGOs believe to be a heightened risk and increasing uncertainty.\nThe coronavirus crisis has crippled employment across the Gulf and could spell ruin for construction, retail and other sectors. The upshot could threaten the very future of migrant labour in all countries \u2013 and in turn threaten the viability of some of the world\u2019s richest economies.",

However, China has sworn to adhere to CTBT terms and the US has been observing a moratorium on nuclear testing.\nIf the treaty were in force, it would include a mechanism for on-site inspections of suspect sites.\nThe US defence intelligence agency leveled similar accusations against Russia in May last year, which were never confirmed. US hawks have been urging the Trump administration to formally break from the CTBT, leaving it free to conduct new nuclear tests of its own.\n\u201cBeijing is modernising its nuclear arsenal while the United States handcuffs itself with one-sided arms-control,\u201d Republican Senator Tom Cotton said on Twitter. \u201cChina has proven it can\u2019t work with us honestly.\u201d\nJeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said that the available evidence was possibly consistent with a low-yield tests or with \u201csub-critical tests\u201d, which do not involve nuclear fission, and which are allowed by the CTBT.\n\u201cIt is worth noting how thin the evidence is for these claims,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cUS, Russia and China all conduct subcritical tests\u2026From satellites and seismic stations, subcritical tests are indistinguishable from low yield nuclear tests.\u201d\nThe finding may worsen ties already strained by US charges that the global Covid-19 pandemic resulted from Beijing\u2019s mishandling of a 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan.\nThe evidence cited by the state department report claimed Beijing\u2019s included blocking data transmissions from sensors linked to an international monitoring center. However, a spokeswoman for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which verifies compliance with the pact, told the Journal there had been no interruptions in data transmissions from China\u2019s five sensor stations since September 2019. Before that, there were interruptions as a result of the negotiating process between the CTBTO and China on arrangements for putting the stations in operation.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing that China was committed to a moratorium on nuclear tests and said the United States was making false accusations.\n\u201cChina has always adopted a responsible attitude, earnestly fulfilling the international obligations and promises it has assumed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US criticism of China is entirely groundless, without foundation, and not worth refuting.\u201d\nA senior US official said the concerns about China\u2019s testing activities buttressed President Donald Trump\u2019s case for getting China to join the US and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace the 2010 New Start treaty between Washington and Moscow that expires in February next year.\nNew Start restricted the US and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.\n\u201cThe pace and manner by which the Chinese government is modernising its stockpile is worrying, destabilising, and illustrates why China should be brought into the global arms control framework,\u201d said the senior US official on condition of anonymity.\nChina, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump\u2019s proposal, arguing its nuclear force is defensive and poses no threat.\nRussia, France and Britain \u2013 three of the world\u2019s five internationally recognised nuclear powers \u2013 signed and ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which still requires ratification by 44 countries to become international law.",

During all of that time they have not asked any questions going to the underlying asset positions of the products.\u201d\nHe said the regulator\u2019s application for an injunction seemed to rely on the idea that there was \u201csome \u2018ginormous\u2019 risk, an insolvency risk, about repayment\u201d.\n\u201cIn my respectful submission, Asic cannot contend, based on its material, that there is such a risk.\u201d",

        "content": "Welcome to our monthly roundup of the biggest issues in farming and food production, with must-read reports from around the web\nPigs and poultry are likely to be safe from Covid-19, according to German scientists, whose study showed that while fruit bats and ferrets were susceptible to infection, pigs and chickens were not. Coronaviruses have devastated farm animals in the past. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) killed nearly 25,000 piglets in China in 2016\u201317. \n  A new outbreak of African swine fever (ASF), a highly contagious virus fatal to pigs, has been reported on a farm in Poland close to the German border. The German states of Brandenburg and Saxony have both recently built fences along the border with Poland to keep out wild boars infected with ASF. Meanwhile, in China authorities have launched a 60-day campaign to crack down on improper or illegal transportation of pigs to reduce ASF transmission. The outbreak in the country has already wiped out 40% of its pig population.\n  MEPs and campaigners have called on the EU to ban live exports to reduce the spread of zoonotic disease. The European Food Safety Authority has said in the past that the live export trade is a potential risk to public health. It said stresses associated with handling and transport may cause latent infections to proceed to clinical disease. These animals may infect others and in many cases (such as salmonellosis) would also increase the risk to public health.\n  A group of 40 NGOs have also written to the EU to demand an overhaul of its food and farming system post Covid-19. The pandemic had \u201cbrought to light some of the dysfunctions of our current globalised and unsustainable food systems, including the link between the increased emergence of zoonoses and intensive animal farming\u201d, they said. The letter also urged the EU not to delay the launch of its new Farm to Fork strategy any later than this month.\nThe US is to give billions in aid to farmers to help them cope with falls in commodity prices. Dairy farmers and processors in the US and Canada have been dumping milk after a collapse in demand following the closure of restaurants and schools, which are large buyers of dairy products, left them with a glut. The government has been asked to pay producers to cut milk output and buy up cheese, butter and other dairy products for food banks. Meanwhile, the closure of a number of US meat processing plants due to Covid-19 is leading to fears of disruption to food supplies and a lack of places for farmers to send animals.\nThe UK beef and lamb sectors say a decline in sales of prime cuts with the shutdown of the food service sector is leading to a collapse in the value of animals. Converting higher value cuts into mince is less profitable for farmers. Abattoirs and processing plants across the meat sector are also having to reduce production due to employees self-isolating with Covid-19 and the requirement for two-metre distancing in factories.Dairy farmers and processors are already dumping milk after a collapse in milk prices. \u201cFood service volume is not being replaced by supermarkets,\u201d said one major processor. \u201cThere is nowhere left [to send it]\u201d. Farming charities have called for the government to step in to buy or reimburse dairy farmers who are not insured for milk losses or are being affected by Covid-19 price cuts.\nFarming groups have protested after retailers started stocking Polish mince in UK stores. Red meat processor ABP said panic buying had forced it to source Polish beef because it did not have the processing capacity to meet the surge in demand.\n  MPs from the environment, food and rural affairs committee are launching an inquiry into how the food supply chain has been disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis and what steps are needed to manage consumer access to healthy food. The public have been asked to submit their views to the committee via an online survey.\nAnimal welfare campaigners have expressed concern after China included wildlife such as deer, game birds, mink and foxes on a list of animals that it plans to allow to be farmed. \u201cRebranding wildlife as livestock doesn\u2019t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments \u2026 some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19,\u201d said Peter Li, China policy specialist with Humane Society International, who welcomed additional plans to ban the eating of dogs.\nThe number of large-scale intensive pig and poultry farms continues to rise in the UK, according to new analysis. There are now more than 1,700 farms with upwards of 40,000 birds or 2,000 pigs, up 7% between 2017\u201318. The increase has caused a backlash in Powys, known as the \u201cpoultry capital of Wales\u201d with 60 times as many chickens as people in the county. Intensive farms have been linked to local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions, as well as potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and air pollutants.\n  Irish calves have been filmed apparently being beaten and kicked by workers at a French feeding station. One calf was put down by a vet. Ireland\u2019s dairy sector, which earned the country \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.9bn) in export revenues last year, relies heavily on veal farms in mainland Europe to buy unwanted male dairy calves. Just under 250,000 were exported in 2018.\n  Boris Johnson was personally thanked by the Brazilian government after refusing to criticise the Amazon fires and sharp rise in deforestation in Brazil last summer. Opposition parties in the UK have called for guarantees that any future UK-Brazil trade deal would not contribute to the destruction of the Amazon.\nLastly, a micro-tannery owner has spoken out about his quest to help create a value for thousands of male \u201cbilly\u201d dairy goats that would otherwise be killed at birth through producing luxury bags, wallets and made-to-order shoes.\nCamilla Saunders, from Sustainable Food Knighton, a group of local residents campaigning against a broiler unit in the town of Knighton in Powys, contacted us last week in response the article: Life in the \u2018poultry capital\u2019 of Wales: enough is enough, say overwhelmed residents. She said:\nWhat is happening in Powys is a microcosm of all that is bad about global food production\u2026 [We] have come to the depressing conclusion that in the case of intensive farming, planning departments routinely ignore laws and recommendations that try to protect animals, humans, and ecosystems, locally and globally.\nWe want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry.

It\u2019s really bad,\u201d he complained.\nMillions of impoverished Venezuelans have abandoned their economically devastated country in recent years, fanning out across Latin America in search of survival.\nIn recent days Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has trumpeted the timid reversal of that trend caused by the coronavirus as proof of his revolution\u2019s strength and compassion.\n\u201cThey want to come back \u2026 and I say to them: \u2018Brothers and sisters! Welcome! The homeland welcomes you with open arms,\u2019\u201d Maduro said in a recent broadcast, predicting 15,000 exiles would return from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\nMaduro said he had ordered officials in the border state of T\u00e1chira to greet returnees with \u201clove and affection\u201d as well as blood tests to prove they were not importing the coronavirus.\nBut migrants in Ure\u00f1a claimed they had instead found dire, unsanitary conditions in which they feared the coronavirus could easily spread.\nPhotographs shared with the Guardian showed scenes of squalor: blocked toilets, muddy bathroom floors and people sleeping on the ground of the derelict building.\n\u201cWe had no idea they were going to make us stay here. There are a lot of us and we know that because of this virus this shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d said Thais Colmenares, a 24-year-old migrant from Venezuela\u2019s M\u00e9rida state.\nColmenares decided to return home last week after losing her job as a waitress in Colombia\u2019s capital, Bogot\u00e1, when the city went into lockdown.\nShe headed home with little but a giant cuddly panda for the three-year-old daughter she had been forced to leave behind when she fled abroad in search of a better life.\nBut with Colmenares trapped in compulsory quarantine, that reunion will have to wait. \u201cWe hardly have water to wash ourselves or to drink. The conditions for showering and sleeping aren\u2019t fit for purpose,\u201d she said.\nUpon arrival, Venezuelan authorities told returnees they would be held for two weeks before being allowed to travel home, but there has since been no confirmation of this, returnees told the Guardian.\nFelipe Mu\u00f1oz, Colombia\u2019s presidential adviser on the migration crisis said it was \u201ca huge mistake\u201d for Venezuelans to be heading to the border during the pandemic and believes that most of those who have left will end up back in Colombia in coming weeks.\n\u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t have the capacity to take these people in. The [Venezuelan] government has forced the governor of T\u00e1chira to accept all these people,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz claimed.\nMu\u00f1oz said Venezuelan authorities had so far admitted about 3,000 returnees but predicted \u201cthere will surely be more in the coming days.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the information we have, the conditions in which they are being received are really serious, so that\u2019s why I hope that during this time of pandemic, Venezuelans think twice before putting themselves at risk during the journey and when they get there,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz added.\nThe governor of T\u00e1chira, Laidy G\u00f3mez, did not respond to several requests for comment.\nThe United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said its officials were trying to dissuade Venezuelans in Colombia from returning. \u201cThere is no capacity in the border to receive them,\u201d said Jozef Merkx, the group\u2019s representative there.\nRub\u00e9n Rueda, a 25-year-old migrant from T\u00e1chira, arrived at the border last Sunday, after 18 months in Colombia, and is also being held in the disused school.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no beds. For the first three days, every single person here slept on the floor. There\u2019s about 500 people here now and only 40 beds, so they go to those who most need them.\u201d\nHe decided to return home after losing his job because of Colombia\u2019s lockdown, which is due to last until at least 27 April.\n\u201cIf I had known it was going to be like this [in Venezuela], I wouldn\u2019t have come. But I was anxious and I wanted to get home to my mum,\u201d Rueda said.",

        "content": "Lawyer Bao Yuming accused of repeatedly assaulting teenage girl known as Xingxing\nThe alleged sexual assault of a teenager by a prominent lawyer and oil executive in China has sparked calls for the government to do more to address the sexual abuse of children and women, including raising the age of consent from 14.\nBao Yuming has been accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting a teenage girl, now 18 and given the pseudonym Xingxing, in 2016.\nBao was fired as the vice-president of a Chinese oil company and resigned from his role advising the tech giant ZTE after the allegations and an interview with the victim were published in Chinese media this week.\nXingxing said the abuse began shortly after she turned 14, the legal age of consent in China.\n\u201cIf the law sets the age of consent at 14, it tacitly grants sexual autonomy to minors over 14 and implies that they can freely decide to engage in sexual activity,\u201d Zhu Guangxing, an assistant professor of criminal law at China University of Political Science and Law, wrote in Sixth Tone.\n\u201cIn too many cases, however, this only creates an opportunity for offenders to prey upon young, sexually ignorant minors, knowing they can later claim it was consensual to sidestep any legal repercussions.\u201d\nA Weibo account run by the Chinese #MeToo activist Zhou Xiaoxuan and her friends published a statement on Wednesday saying minors were much more easily abused in a system that ascribed the power of consent at such a young age, when \u201cthey have very few ways to protect themselves in the first place\u201d.\n\u201cMost of the time they don\u2019t know how to retain the evidence and must report the case in the first place,\u201d it said. \u201cSecondly, girls who are underage, they do not understand the definition of sexual assault itself. According to the New York Times, Bao has acknowledged a \u201cclose relationship\u201d with Xingxing, but he has denied any wrongdoing and accused Xingxing of fabricating her story.\nAccording to Chinese media, Xingxing reported the allegations to police in April 2019, but the investigation was closed before the month was out.\nLast week Yantai police said they had reopened their investigation into the allegations against Bao in October.\nChinese media have also reported that Xingxing was informally adopted by Bao from Xingxing\u2019s mother.\nBao\u2019s \u201cillegal adoption\u201d was an unavoidable issue, said Zhou in her statement.\nXingxing allegedly first raised the alarm more than a year after Chinese courts formalised guidelines on dealing with the abuse of minors by guardians.\nZhou\u2019s statement said that on their reading of the guidelines, Xingxing\u2019s parents did not completely abandon her, \u201cbut they did not pay attention to her at all\u201d. It accused them of avoiding their obligations.\nXingxing\u2019s account said she provided forensic and video evidence to police. She also alleged that a police officer put his hand on her neck to recreate one of her allegations against Bao during questioning, and that officers allowed Bao to be in the same room as her.\nHer story prompted countless women and girls to share stories of their own abuse and the failure of authorities to respond appropriately, and to question the lack of sex education for young people in the country.\n\u201cDo you know why sexual assault of minors occurs again and again? They [alleged abusers] are exposed time and again but vanish each time \u2026 without severe punishment,\u201d said a high-profile Chinese actor, Zhang Ziyi, on Weibo.\nAmnesty International said it was aware of Xingxing\u2019s case, and called for the Chinese government to work with civil society groups to combat abuse, instead of shutting them out of the spaces where they operate.\n\u201cThis only hinders the progress of reducing sexual harassment in the country. The government should work with anti-harassment activists instead of silencing them,\u201d said the researcher Doriane Lau.\n\u201cIn general, we have seen the government taking steps to tackle the prevalence of sexual harassment in China, such as including sexual harassment protections in the amended Civil Code,\u201d Lau said.\n\u201cHowever, civil society groups and actors doing anti-sexual harassment activism continued to face severe persecution from the authorities.\u201d\nIn its 2019 country report, Human Rights Watch said the Chinese government \u201cremains hostile to women\u2019s rights activism\u201d.\nAdditional reporting by Pei Lin Wu",

But she has been inconsolable since having to move away from her husband, who has a pre-existing condition, and 12-year-old daughter for fear of contaminating them with coronavirus.\nWeissman is one of thousands of medical workers on the frontline of New York City\u2019s Covid-19 crisis who have been forced to cobble together makeshift living situations \u2013 sleeping in hotels, basements, borrowed apartments and even cars \u2013 to avoid bringing the virus home to their housemates and families.\n\u201cI went to see my family yesterday from across the street and my daughter was begging me to just hug her,\u201d the 42-year-old said. \u201c[She was] crying and I was crying. This is the worst thing I ever felt. Absolutely horrible that I can\u2019t hug my kid.\u201d She fears she will not get to see them properly until September.\nMany have also made the difficult decision to stop seeing their partners and children for potentially months to avoid infecting them.\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to get a room at Four Seasons hotel in Manhattan \u2013 which is among the New York hotels providing free lodging to Covid-19 medical personnel \u2013 she managed to borrow an apartment from a friend.\nBut she said many of her colleagues at her hospital were still \u201cscrambling\u201d to find a place to stay this week.\n\u201cWe consider ourselves to be tough in this profession, we see a lot every day, and people are breaking down because they have loved ones in the hospital, they live with their parents, they live with their kids, they don\u2019t want to leave their kids.\u201d\nThough the number of people being hospitalized in New York City appears to be leveling out, more than 18,000 patients remained packed into its hospitals, this week, and medical workers are still at risk. According to Johns Hopkins, 5,150 people had died in hospital in the city after contracting coronavirus as of Friday morning.\nNurse Luke Adams, 35, spent 10 days sleeping in his car after arriving in New York from his home in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, to assist in the coronavirus effort. He said he tried Four Seasons and Airbnb but didn\u2019t get any calls back.\n\u201cI came with the little baby mattress in the back of the rented car just assuming that there would be some lag time between when I showed up and when there would probably be some programmes in place for the people that were going to come,\u201d he said.\nHe has since been allocated a room at a hotel near Staten Island University hospital, where he is temporarily working, but he said it\u2019s important that medical workers know they have somewhere to sleep.\n\u201cWe are asking for a lot of people to come and help and one of the biggest hurdles that they will face is \u2018OK, I want to come help but where am I going to be putting my head?\u2019\u201d\nThe father of two, who missed seeing his nine-month-old daughter crawl for the first time, said being separated from family is taking its toll on medical workers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a lot in the hospital and then you have the mental aspect, the isolation in that way from family and stuff is also tough.\u201d\nAnother medical volunteer, Dr Richard Levitan, who travelled from New Hampshire to work at Bellevue hospital centre, was asked to leave his brother\u2019s apartment by the building\u2019s board of directors, according to the New York Times.\nNew York nurse Meagan Mullany, 25, said healthcare workers are being treated like \u201cpariahs\u201d.\n\u201cIt breaks my heart honestly because I know everyone\u2019s scared and I don\u2019t fault people for being scared, but at the same time I just wish people would understand what we\u2019re all giving up,\u201d she added. \u201cNot to make myself out to be a martyr, because I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just doing my job, but I just wish people would be a little more understanding.\u201d\nShe usually lives with her parents, who have co-morbidities, and siblings, one of whom has severe asthma, but has decided to move in with her boyfriend.\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m making the right decision. I feel like there\u2019s no good decision in all this,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the hospital offered housing, but the problem is I\u2019m going to be like all alone and I don\u2019t know if I could take the social isolation right now.\u201d\nLance Eljeer Hawkins, 46, a surgical technician at a Manhattan hospital, decided it was safest not to see either of his two children, who he doesn\u2019t live with but usually sees several times a week, because of the outbreak. He is also now looking for alternative housing so he does not put his sister and nephew, who he lives with, at risk.\n\u201cIt weighs on you. To make that decision not to see them [the children] until this dies down a bit or slows down a bit and we can get back to some level of normalcy, and I use that word not very stringently because I think nothing will be normal after this. So it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said.\nFor those who work outside the state, coronavirus is also causing upheaval.\nDeloris Wright, 64, usually commutes from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to work at a senior living facility in Philadelphia, but following the outbreak she is sleeping at her workplace.\nShe said: \u201cThis is week number four for me at work. I haven\u2019t been going home because I don\u2019t want to travel from here to Brooklyn and then bring back anything in here \u2026 I\u2019m really taking it in stride and just trying to be calm and not anxious.\u201d\nMeanwhile, at home, she has ongoing problems with her landlord who she said has left holes in the wall of her rented apartment. \u201cAll I can do is just hope for the best, because I\u2019m not there so I can\u2019t even fight them. I just have to pause.\u201d\nNew York City Emergency Management said it is working with Greater New York Hospital Association and NYC Health and Hospitals to provide accommodation for frontline healthcare workers who a spokesman said can \u201crequest a room through the hospital with which they work or have been assigned\u201d.\n\u201cThe rooms are used to isolate healthcare workers who are displaying Covid-19 symptoms or have come into contact with a positive Covid-19 patient and do not want to return home in order to protect their loved ones from potential exposure,\u201d he added.\nHe said they have set up a call centre for people to access the service, which works with designated \u201cpoints of contact\u201d, in place at all hospitals, to make hotel referrals.\nFour Seasons said the hotel is \u201cincredibly sorry to hear about the nurses\u2019 experience\u201d and that they had not anticipated the number of requests the hotel would receive. It is now working with hospitals and medical associations to fill its 225 available rooms rather than handling bookings directly and this week it said it was at full capacity with medical professionals.\nA spokesman for Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office said: \u201cEvery day, healthcare professionals are on the frontlines battling Covid-19 in hospitals around New York state \u2013 including tens of thousands of volunteers from other communities. Generous New Yorkers have proactively offered hotel rooms and apartments to support these heroes, and every day we are connecting them to accommodations in a safe, responsible, and coordinated manner.\u201d",

When on holiday in Cornwall last year I was usually found chasing after her as she climbed terrifying rocks or, more often, just walked into the sea. She was four. Here she is walking into the sea between rocks at Widemouth Bay near Bude.Laura Benson\nAs a child you were already in my eyes this great lady ... I always loved that you were at the centre of my drawings ... O majestic mountain, you queen of the Morne peninsula. Beautiful and silent you keep in your soul the history of the island \u2026 You live in time.Jean-Marc Planteau de Maroussem\n Guardian Travel readers' tips\nEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels, a selection of which will be featured online. There is usually a travel-related prize for the best tipper but that has been suspended for the time being \u2013 though hopefully it will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we\u2019d still love you to share your finds with fellow readers. To enter the latest competition visit the\u00a0readers' tips homepage\nI went to the Hummingbird Garden at El Silencio Lodge and Spa to photograph a creature who loves at 1,260 heartbeats per minute. But the hummingbird moves faster than I can set my shutter speed. The first picture has her as a smudge across the lens. In the next shot I captured only a flower, perfectly in focus but sucked of nectar, and the bird had flown. I learned to listen for the blur of wings; I learned to slow my breathing; I learned to be still. Elizabeth Gowing\nWe\u2019d visited Etosha national park before, but had rushed from one waterhole to the next. This time, we decided to spend a whole day at Okaukuejo waterhole. While tourists loaded in to safari vehicles, we sat and watched. Herds of springbok and zebra gave way to jackals hunting and playing. They were joined by a rhino and giraffes. Shortly before midday, over 20 elephants suddenly appeared, and rushed into the water like excited teenagers. The safari vehicles hadn\u2019t returned from their searches, so it was just us (well, and one other couple) and the elephants. Magical. Frances Valdes\nOn a budget trip to Japan with my sisters and brother-in-law, one night in Osaka we stumbled into this tiny bar. The place was charming but, without any menus, we were afraid of falling into the classic tourist trap of spending a fortune. Several times, the kind, aged bartender explained we were in a nomihodai. The problem was, we didn\u2019t know what that meant. We cautiously ordered one drink each and \u2013 on his insistence \u2013 a glass of sake. He was so hospitable and tried to serve us food and more drinks but, still uneasy, we politely declined. It was only afterwards we learned that a nomihodai is an all-you-can-eat/drink bar. We could have stayed there for hours!Sarah Collings\nI took this in Gambia after our taxi broke down in the middle of nowhere. We had to walk a mile to the nearest village to find a mechanic. The local children found our breakdown quite amusing. This had been a special day, travelling cross-country to see chimpanzees and hippos in the wild. So although we missed our ferry back, the day will stay with me for a long time.Richard Gabriel\nThis is my daughter Lucia (aged 14) in the sea at Peniscola, near Valencia, in 2010. The photo sums up that holiday \u2013 hot, watery and very Spanish. Every day we would gather at our apartment poolside bar, where all the holidaying locals in their swimwear would drink cold wine, eat seafood tapas and smoke. There were very few British tourists but a number of French and Germans. In the town there was a wonderful cafeteria called Los Jubilados run by retired ladies who served vast plates of arroz negro and chipirones at ridiculously low prices. It\u2019s a beautiful place to visit, particularly in the summer heat.Simon Williams\nTo celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary in August 2016, we invited a crowd of family and friends to join us in West Sweden \u2013 many of whom had been with us when we married on the beach on the island of Orust. We live in the UK but visit my husband\u2019s native land as often as we can. The day we visited the island of Tj\u00f6rn to jump from the diving tower at Stockevik was perfect, sunny and warm. Heaven! Deb Hampson\nThis shows my normally very-well behaved and law-abiding daughter Aakshi, doing her best to get herself arrested by New York\u2019s finest. One of a set of fabulous pics from an extended family trip across the US and Canada.Kaushik\nGeorge Orwell described Jura, where he wrote 1984, as \u201cthe most ungetatable place\u201d. My family really put this assessment to the test when within 10 hours of arriving my dad\u2019s long-term medical condition had flared up. This precipitated a mad rush to get him on the last night ferry to Islay, through the tail end of Hurricane Dorian. From Islay hospital he was airlifted to Glasgow (and apparently fed chips en route by the paramedics). He returned in good health to the tranquillity of Jura, where members of the population of 188 showed the full extent of their hospitality and generosity. He thereafter received innumerable free ferry trips and enquiries after his health (it seems gossip spread remarkably fast!).Cora\nWalking along the Southbank, I came across this shot. I loved the juxtaposition of a typical beach scene, including someone drinking from a fresh coconut, with the City of London as a backdrop. This image perfectly illustrated the diversity and ingenuity of this wonderful capital city.Chris Paterson\nI was backpacking solo in Asia when I found myself on Kho Phangan in Thailand.

It is three hours until sunrise, and five before the state-run coronavirus drive-through testing station opens its gates, but the early arrivals, some coughing and feverish, all wearing face masks, want to be sure of their slot.\nEven so, some are out of luck. With a daily capacity of only 400 tests, it takes authorities fewer than 120 minutes to exhaust their limited supply of throat swabs, and those at the back of the queue \u2013 after hours waiting in temperatures close to 90F \u2013 are sent away to try another day.\nMeanwhile, over on Fisher Island, a swanky enclave for the super wealthy barely 15 miles away, and where the average annual income is $2.5m, it is a different story.\nIsland managers\u2019 controversial private purchase of thousands of rapid Covid-19 blood test kits from the University of Miami\u2019s health system means there is no need for any resident to leave the island or wait in line with the public at large.\nHere, there is time for a leisurely breakfast and a stroll around the 216 acres of America\u2019s richest zip code before stopping by an air-conditioned medical office for a guaranteed swift blood draw. While those fortunate enough to have received a test at the stadium must wait several days for a result, the instant nature of the in-demand blood antibody tests means islanders learn of their situation within minutes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no different from Disney World, where you can buy that special pass and cut in front of the line for 30% more,\u201d said Dr Jay Wolfson, professor of public health medicine at the University of South Florida.\n\u201cThe control and distribution of essential resources in the US economy is by design, structure and culture driven by those who have such means. The Fisher Island people can cut a deal on the side with the University of Miami and they get to take care of themselves.\u201d\nThis juxtaposition of the haves and have-nots has sparked a backlash in Miami-Dade county, a coronavirus hotspot whose 7,863 cases by Wednesday lunchtime were more than double that of any other county, according to the Florida\u2019s department of health.\nA lack of accessible testing for poorer and more vulnerable members of society has caused friction between local authorities and the state, and the county mayor, Carlos Gimenez, announced this week that in-home testing would be available for some residents unable to reach drive-through sites.\nAlberto Carvalho, superintendent of the Miami-Dade school district, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest with more than 350,000 students, vented his frustration on Twitter at the privilege enjoyed by Fisher Island\u2019s 800 families.\n\u201cFame, fortune, power, or position should not in any way allow anyone to skip the Covid-19 test waiting line,\u201d he wrote.\nSome criticism is directed at the University of Miami health system (UHealth), which recorded a record $217.2m profit in 2018, financial records show. UHealth accepted an undisclosed amount of money from Fisher Island for thousands of the blood tests, the Miami Herald said, available to every resident and worker regardless of whether they were showing symptoms.\nA UHealth spokeswoman, Lisa Worley, did not answer specific questions from the Guardian about the arrangement, but sent a statement admitting the episode had prompted introspection.\n\u201cWe understand it may have created the impression that certain communities would receive preferential treatment. That was not our intent,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cOne of the first confirmed cases of coronavirus in Miami-Dade county was on Fisher Island, more than half of the population is over 60 and many residents were returning from the Northeast. These factors, at the time, were taken into consideration when the request was received.\u201d\nIt added that UHealth would be \u201crevising its process for reviewing testing outreach requests\u201d.\nUHealth has been collaborating with Miami-Dade county on an unrelated community testing programme, Worley said.\nNobody was available to comment on Wednesday at the Fisher Island club, which according to Business Insider charges annual membership dues above $22,000 on top of a quarter-million-dollar initial fee.\nAt the Hard Rock Stadium, temperatures reached 92F on Wednesday. The Florida association of public information officers, which has been handling media inquiries for the site, warned again of long wait times and advised drivers to have a full tank of gas.\nWolfson, the public health professor, said the drive-through system still excluded many at-risk residents, including the elderly and disabled, and racial minorities shown by data to suffer higher rates of infection.\n\u201cMaybe they can apply for jobs on Fisher Island,\u201d he said.",

Shell now needs to go further with our own ambitions, which is why we aim to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner. Society, and our customers, expect nothing less,\u201d he said.\nVan Beurden told investors on Thursday that Shell would toughen its existing target to shrink the carbon intensity of its products by 50% within 30 years, to reach 65% by 2050. The plan includes an interim target to cut the so-called \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions by more than a third by 2030, up from 20% previously.\nShell\u2019s target relies on the oil and gas company shifting its business towards selling clean energy products such as renewable energy and biofuels, and working alongside its \u201cnet-zero\u201d customers to also help offset the carbon impact too.\nThe oil giant said it plans to work with its customers, such as major airlines, to share the burden of offsetting the carbon from fossil fuel products which may still be in use by 2050, such as jet fuels.\nAdam Matthews, a director on the Church of England Pensions Board, welcomed Shell\u2019s focus on helping to develop \u201cnet-zero pathways\u201d for key sectors such as aviation which shape the demand for energy.\n\u201cUltimately, it will be by developing and supporting net-zero pathways in these sectors that we will achieve the goals of the Paris agreement,\u201d he said.\nShell plans to offset its own emissions by trapping as much carbon as its business operations cause through new carbon capture technologies or through natural solutions such as planting trees.\nThe tougher climate plans come two months after BP raised eyebrows by setting out an \u201cambition\u201d to cut its carbon emissions to zero by offsetting more greenhouse gas emissions every year than produced by the whole of the UK.\nWhereas BP\u2019s ambitious targets include an absolute reduction in emissions, Shell has chosen to focus on the overall carbon intensity of the energy it sells, which could be lowered by selling more clean energy alternatives without reducing the amount of fossil fuels produced.\nRichard George, head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s climate campaign, said: \u201cA credible net-zero plan from Shell would start with a commitment to stop drilling for new oil and gas.\n\u201cInstead, investors are being fobbed off with vague aspirations that don\u2019t tackle Shell\u2019s monstrous carbon footprint and pass the buck to Shell\u2019s customers to offset their emissions,\u201d he said.\nBP and Shell have both faced criticism for offering only vague plans to reach their ambition. While BP offered no interim targets towards the 2050 goal, Shell has set a tougher 2035 target to help hold the company to account.\nMajor investors and pension funds within the Climate Change 100+ alliance applauded Shell\u2019s plan , calling it a significant step in the right direction for global climate action.\nCorien Wortmann-Kool, chairwoman of the ABP pension fund, said: \u201cWe appreciate the fact that Shell regularly evaluates and now raises its ambitions. After the earlier announcements in 2017 and 2018, Shell\u2019s example has been followed by other oil and gas companies. We hope that this announcement will again have a domino effect.\u201d",

I saw it on a school trip. I had been a typical small-town Canadian boy who played ice hockey. My life changed that day. I wanted to make people feel like I\u2019d just been made to feel. Colm Wilkinson was extraordinary in the role \u2013 it was almost as if every note he sang would be his last. Because I came from such a small town, ignorance was bliss. If I told anyone that\u2019s what I wanted to do, they\u2019d say: \u201cCool, OK!\u201d No one told you me how hard it would be.\nThe Phantom is unhinged. He kills people, he\u2019s manipulative, but there\u2019s something about him as an underdog. This is what society has created. How can you not have compassion or empathy for him?\nI couldn\u2019t get into the role when we were rehearsing. But putting the makeup and the mask on helped. Usually it\u2019s good to work in a character\u2019s shoes \u2013 with this part I needed the face and mask. I was in my attic the other day and found a bunch of them from Phantom and the sequel, Love Never Dies. I gave one of them to Nicole Scherzinger after we did the Royal Variety performance because she did such an extraordinary job. I said: \u201cAll right, you get a mask!\u201d\nWhenever people start telling me stories about theatres being haunted, I walk away. I don\u2019t need to know that! When I played the Phantom I was always the last to leave the building because of all that makeup I had to take off. My tough-guy attitude really disappeared when I was left alone.\nI love working with Sierra Boggess, who plays Christine. We both love to perform but for the first two or three weeks of lockdown neither of us wanted to sing. I went into dad mode \u2013 are we healthy, is my family OK, have we got groceries? Once it became clear this would be our norm, I still wanted to sing. So we performed Once Upon Another Time from Love Never Dies together online.\nI\u2019m just as much a fan of the show as I am the Phantom. I grew up loving it and then I happened to be the Phantom for a moment in time and now I\u2019m a fan again. It will be great to relive it with everyone. This is a crazy time. We are all at home looking for something to help us forget. It should be quite a special moment.\nThe Phantom of the Opera is free to watch from 7pm BST on Friday 17 April (for 24 hours for UK viewers and 48 hours in other territories) as part of The Shows Must Go On, a series offering a different Andrew Lloyd Webber musical each week.",

During one of those crossings, a photograph was snapped of American soldiers watching a boxing match with the ocean as their backdrop. The vast majority of the soldiers wore facemasks to protect themselves from the influenza pandemic that was spreading across the globe. The photo captures one of the most severe pandemics in human history and how its effects trickled down to sports.\nNow a century removed from the Spanish flu, the world is once again in a global pandemic. Airports have been shuttered, borders closed, and mass gatherings have been banned around the world as Covid-19 spreads. Sports leagues and organizations, most recently the UFC, have suspended competition.\nAnd yet, the UFC has hinted that it is preparing to host events on a private island or Native American tribal lands in the near future \u2013 a reckless attempt to avoid government mandates and stay-at-home orders. Given the promotion\u2019s continued defiance in the face of Covid-19, it should at least take into account the experiences of other combat sports during the Spanish flu outbreak.\nBoxing, like much of the rest of the world, came to a standstill during the last pandemic. A story on 13 October 1918 in the New York Times gave the details:\n\u201cBoxing in the East is now at a standstill, because of the epidemic of Spanish influenza. Promoters in Philadelphia, Boston, and New Jersey, in compliance with requests issued by their different Health Departments, have agreed to close up shop. How long the sport will be idle remains to be seen, but it is positive that no matches of any importance will be undertaken while the epidemic continues.\u201d\nBoxing clubs across the country closed as they prepared to deal with the virus ravaging their cities. One of the affected fights was between heavyweight contender Jack Dempsey and light-heavyweight champion Battling Levinsky, who were scheduled to compete in October 1918 in Philadelphia.\nWhile fights across much of the country were sidelined during October \u2013 one of the deadliest months for the pandemic in the United States \u2013 the shutdown did not last long. The 27 October 1918 edition of the Milwaukee Journal revealed that \u201cNovember promises to be replete with boxing action, that is, if the Spanish flu ever takes the count.\u201d Another headline from that same date in the Cleveland Plain Dealer read, \u201cBoxing is Resumed Gradually in East as Flu Ban Moves.\u201d\nThe Dempsey v Levinsky bout eventually went ahead on 6 November, and Dempsey defeated Levinsky by third round KO. Dempsey would go on to fight 11 more times during the pandemic, including his lineal heavyweight title win against Jess Willard in July 1919. Other notable boxers such as Gene Tunney, Harry Greb, San Langford, and Benny Leonard fought dozens of times during the pandemic.\nDespite boxing returning to business as usual in late 1918, several boxers succumbed to the virus, including heavyweight Jim Johnson, Terry Martin, Matty Baldwin, Jim Stewart, Samuel Ranzino, Joe Stein, Al Thomas, and Joe Tuber. Boxing promoter Paddy Carroll and boxing club owner Lorenzo Snow also died from the virus. Canadian sports promoter George Kennedy, who promoted wrestling, boxing, and was best known as the owner of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, contracted the Spanish flu during the pandemic and never fully recovered, eventually passing away from complications related to the illness in 1921.\nSeveral other renowned boxers contracted the virus but managed to recover. Retired heavyweight Jim Jeffries, a former world heavyweight champion who was most famous for being the \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d for attempting to dethrone African American heavyweight champ Jack Johnson in the 1910 \u2018Fight of the Century\u2019, made a surprise recovery in November 1918 at age 43.\nIt remains unclear how many boxers contracted the virus while competing during the pandemic. What we do know, however, is that there were very few policies implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Fans were allowed to attend the events, while hygiene was not generally of the standard it is today. UFC has said it will hold events without a live audience but it still plays a dangerous game if it wants fighters to brawl in close quarters during a pandemic \u2013 and that\u2019s before the threat to officials and televisions crews, not to mention the fact that traveling across the country risks spreading the virus to different communities.\nUFC President Dana White remains defiant though. And while he was unable to go ahead with the UFC 249 pay-per-view event, he maintains that the UFC will be the \u201cfirst sport back\u201d and that \u201cFight Island is real\u201d. On Wednesday, he said he plans to host an event as soon as 9 May.\nWhile governments and hospitals are better prepared to handle a pandemic now than they were a century ago thanks to a medical revolution and the lack of world wars depleting infrastructure and services, it is important that sports leagues and organizations refrain from taking any reckless action during a global health crisis. Instead, promotions such as the UFC should look back on history and learn from the mistakes of the previous pandemics.",

McCormack\u2019s statement kept the door open for even more funding, saying the government would monitor the market \u201cand determine if further action is required\u201d.\nVirgin Australia said the assistance would enable the airline to reinstate some of its stood down flight, cabin and ground crew, along with other operational team members.\nIt is understood about 200 Virgin Australia staff will be reinstated to operate the flights, including ground crew, cabin crew and pilots. The airline is planning to operate 64 return services each week.\nVirgin Australia will also continue to operate international repatriation flights between Australia and Hong Kong and Australia and Los Angeles for a limited time.\nIts bigger rival Qantas, which has been considering closing some flights because they are running at less than a third full, has also been funded under the program.\nIn a statement, Qantas said the funding would allow it and its budget offshoot Jetstar to increase the number of passenger flights they operated each week from 105 to 164.\nGuardian Australia has previously reported Virgin Australia was considering going into administration as it raced against time to get out from under a $4.8bn debt pile.\nAmid calls from the federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, for the government to rescue the airline, it has hired insolvency and turnaround experts at Deloitte to work on restructure scenarios, Guardian Australia has learned.\nVirgin Australia had asked for a $1.4bn loan from the government as part of a proposed broader $5bn airline industry bailout.\nDuring a press conference earlier on Thursday, Scott Morrison declined to be specific when asked whether the government would bail out Virgin Australia.\nThe prime minister said the government appreciated the value of two competitive, viable airlines in the Australian economy, but repeated his position that any support would be done \u201con a sector-wide basis\u201d.\nMorrison also suggested the airlines were pursuing market-based options and he \u201cwould wish those discussions every success\u201d.\nAirline sources said the earlier $1bn industry support package did little to help because $700m of it was made up of waivers of fees that were not charged when planes were grounded.",

Thousands of angry conservatives broke the taboo regarding mass gatherings to converge on Michigan\u2019s statehouse in Lansing on Wednesday, in protest at the state\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, which its Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has extended until 30 April. Amid chants of \u201clock her up\u201d, some demonstrators said they were distressed by the economic impact of the lockdown, while others just wanted to go to the hairdressers.\nMichigan deaths. Ninety miles away in Detroit, hospitals are being overwhelmed with patients suffering the effects of Covid-19, which has killed close to 2,000 people in the state to date. Worldwide, the number of confirmed cases has now passed 2 million.\nIn Washington, Donald Trump waxed optimistic about reopening the US, as the country recorded 2,400 deaths, the highest one-day total for any nation. At his daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, the president once again pointed the finger at China, casting doubt on Beijing\u2019s official case numbers, and lending credence to the unproven theory that the virus came not from a Wuhan wet market, but from a virology lab \u2013 a theory on which the Pentagon\u2019s top general threw cold water earlier this week.\nGlobal health leaders \u2013 Bill Gates among them \u2013 continue to condemn Trump\u2019s decision to cut US funding for the World Health Organization, pending a review of its dealings with China. It is \u201can act of international vandalism\u201d, says Andrew Gawthorpe:\nThe fact that Trump\u2019s decisions are being driven so transparently by his petty domestic political problems suggests that the world shouldn\u2019t look to Washington to provide responsible leadership any time soon.\n\u2018Shut down Congress\u2019. Trump threatened to take the unprecedented step of adjourning both houses of Congress, so he can keep filling administration vacancies with his nominees during the shutdown.\nNuclear test. As if relations with Beijing weren\u2019t already bad enough, the US state department said on Wednesday it believes China may have secretly conducted a low-yield underground nuclear test.\nA dying Covid-19 patient\u2019s final words as he was put on a ventilator in New York City: \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for it?\u201d As Amanda Holpuch reports, the pandemic has laid bare the flaws in an American health system that has spent decades prioritising cost over care. On Wednesday, nurses in New York led a candlelit vigil in memory of the medics dying on the virus frontline across the US. Miranda Bryant hears from some of the healthcare workers whose own lives have been upended by the crisis.\nIt may have infected prime ministers and princes, but the coronavirus is not the great social leveller it was cracked up to be. The world\u2019s richest man, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, just got a lot richer, increasing his vast fortune by some $24bn during (and, indeed, owing to) the pandemic. Meanwhile, a non-partisan committee has said millionaires and billionaires will reap more than 80% of the benefits from a change to tax law included by Republicans in the congressional coronavirus relief package.\nMiami\u2019s unequal testing. At Miami\u2019s Hard Rock stadium, hundreds of potential Covid-19 patients wait in line for hours for a limited number of tests. But on nearby Fisher Island, an enclave for the city\u2019s super-rich, everyone has access to instant testing. Richard Luscombe reports.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has demanded clinical trials of a controversial drug cocktail, which infection specialist Didier Raoult claims could be a cure for coronavirus. Raoult\u2019s combination of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic, azithromycin, has been hailed by populist leaders, including Trump. But as Julia Carrie Wong explains on the Today in Focus podcast, hydroxychloroquine is not just an unproven Covid-19 treatment \u2013 it might also be harmful.\nWarren threw her hat into the running mate ring. The Massachusetts senator gave Joe Biden his third major endorsement in as many days \u2013 and said that, if asked, she would accept an offer to be his vice-presidential candidate.\nMoon won a coronavirus landslide. The South Korean president and his ruling party have been rewarded for their competent handling of the crisis with the biggest election majority since the country\u2019s transition to democracy in 1987.\nBut in Israel, the political stalemate goes on. Opposition leader Benny Gantz has missed his deadline to form a coalition government \u2013 again \u2013 which means the country could be headed for an unprecedented fourth round of elections.\nWhy the Golden Girls are Instagram icons, 35 years on\nThe classic sitcom about four elderly women living together in Miami still enjoys cult status, almost three decades after the end of its run. And thanks to a substantial Instagram following, its four fashion plate stars remain style leaders in 2020, writes Malcolm MacKenzie.\nHow Islamic extremists are reacting to coronavirus\nIsis and other extremist groups are planning to use the cover of the coronavirus crisis to launch new attacks and bolster their credentials in the Islamic world. But as Jason Burke reports, they also acknowledge the disease poses as much of a threat to their followers as to anyone else.\nSome developed countries already see light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. But in Africa and the developing world, the Covid-19 crisis is just beginning. The international community must act now to avert a catastrophe, says Mohamed El-Erian.\nSub-Saharan Africa may be about to confront a human tragedy so profound that it could leave a generation adrift in some countries, with consequences that extend far beyond the region\u2019s borders.\nThe elusive British street artist Banksy is stuck in lockdown like the rest of us. Fortunately, he\u2019s managing to work from home, and he just posted his latest artwork on Instagram \u2013 apparently created in his own bathroom.

        "content": "Devi Sridhar, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh and also a key adviser to the Scottish government on the Covid-19 pandemic, has described the plan to stage the Tour de France in August as a \u201crecipe for disaster\u201d.\n\u201cThe wise thing to do is cancel for this year,\u201d Sridhar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful decision but they have no choice.\u201d\nThe Tour was moved this week from its original start date in late June to a new Grand D\u00e9part in Nice on 29 August, following the banning of any large public events until 11 July by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.\n\u201cThis is a long-term problem, a chronic problem,\u201d Sridhar told cyclingnews.com. \u201cThis virus is here to stay and will come back. Even if France gets a handle on it by August, then of course the issue is people coming in from different countries.\u201d\nSridhar pointed to a series of potential risks, that might even lead to the Tour being halted if there was an outbreak within the race convoy during the race. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a risk that the Tour de France moving around and unwittingly spreading the virus could kick-start a new lockdown.\u201d\nWhile the Tour\u2019s television partners were delighted to hear the race was going ahead \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s very good news,\u201d said Laurent Prud\u2019homme, director general of French Eurosport \u2013 Sridhar urged the Tour owner ASO to rethink its plan.\n\u201cThey have to weigh the risks against the benefits. Thousands of people from all over the world, gathered together, moving around, from town to town, this is where a virus could thrive \u2013 it could be a recipe for disaster,\u201d Sridhar said.\nShe also suggested those arriving in Nice for the race from countries outside France should be quarantined. \u201cThis [the arrival of the Tour\u2019s international convoy] could set off a new cluster of infections so you\u2019d have to think, at minimum, of a two- to three-week quarantine before they properly come into the country.\u201d\nIdeally, Sridhar said, while acknowledging the logistics would be \u201cmind-boggling\u201d, once the race has started the organisation would test everybody in the convoy every day. \u201cWe know 20% to 60% of people are pre-symptomatic, in that they feel fine and exhibit no symptoms but are passing the virus to others.\u201d\nWhile most European riders have reacted positively to the new scheduling, the participation of some, including the defending champion Egan Bernal, who is confined to Colombia, is not yet a given.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t escaped me that the current champion is in Colombia, but Europe is at the heart of cycling and the majority of riders live in Europe,\u201d the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, said.\nThe rescheduled dates have also caused a headache for other lesser race promoters, including the Tour of Britain organiser Sweetspot, as the postponed Tour de France now clashes with its own race on 6-13 September. Another problem for the British race is a clash of live TV coverage as the official race broadcaster ITV also shows each stage of the French race.\n\u201cThe position we find ourselves in is unprecedented,\u201d Sweetspot said in a statement. \u201cWe are closely monitoring each development as it happens and acting accordingly with our partners and stakeholders across Britain to do the right thing, with the health and wellbeing of all of our supporters being of paramount importance.\u201d",

Of those as many as three-quarters had seen their incomes cut since the government\u2019s lockdown measures were first introduced last month.\nThe early snapshot of the financial blow also showed almost a third already using savings to cover living costs, while more than a fifth say they are are struggling to pay household bills.\nNearly half of all adults said they expected their financial position to worsen over the next 12 months, in a reflection of the rising economic fallout as the government attempts to protect lives by containing the spread of the disease.\nAs economic and social activity around the world has been brought to an effective standstill as the disease spreads, there has been a similar impact in other developed countries. According to figures from the consumer research provider Kantar, one-third of people across the G7 group of wealthy nations are already facing reduced personal income.\nItaly, as the first European country to be hit hard by Covid-19, has suffered the worst hit, followed by Canada and the US, according to the research.\nA quarter of UK firms have temporarily closed or paused trading because of the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown measures, according to another ONS survey of 5,300 businesses. Many of the 75% of companies who are still trading had also furloughed some staff, as they try to ride out the crisis.\nCritics of the government have said Britain entered the coronavirus crisis on a weak footing after a decade of sluggish wage growth and austerity. Average pay levels for British workers only returned to pre-financial crisis levels after inflation at the end of 2019, taking 12 years to repair the damage from the last recession.\nLaura Suter, personal finance analyst at the investment platform AJ Bell, said: \u201cThe UK went into this crisis with a chronic savings deficit, with many households having little to no savings to fall back on if they saw their income hit.\n\u201cIt means that any drop in income will have an immediate effect on lots of households, particularly if there are no big cutbacks they can make, and we\u2019re already seeing the impact of this.\u201d\nAccording to separate figures published by the ONS on Thursday, the price of high-demand food and sanitary products has risen sharply in online shops over the past month as the crisis mounts.\nA basket of the products \u2013 including tinned beans, toilet roll and cleaning materials \u2013 costs 4.4% more than just before lockdown measures began a month ago, according to the government statistics agency, which carried out the comparison.\nPrices rose by 1.8% in the past week alone, driven by soaring pet food prices and a sharp increase in the cost of rice, nappies and handwash.\nThe ONS cautioned that its figures are \u201cexperimental\u201d and that some of the prices it collects online can change rapidly from one week to the next. It said that food prices had been relatively stable over the period from 16 March, just before lockdown measures began, to 12 April. Prices for pet food, which contributed the biggest rise in the overall index, and rice rose by 8.4% and 5.8% over the past month, while prices of pasta sauce fell by 4.5%.\nThe government sets an annual inflation target for the Bank of England of 2% based on a much broader basket of goods and services, which the ONS said should not be directly compared with its experimental statistics. However, the early warning signals from the price of goods in high demand could indicate the start of a squeeze on living standards for households as the economy collapses into recession.",

We\u2019re reporting every death.\u201d\nWorldwide, cases have topped 2 million, with more than 137,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for more than 638,000 cases, and close to 31,000 deaths, while China has recorded a little over 83,000 cases and 3,300 deaths.\nTrump went on to endorse a theory that the naturally occurring virus escaped a laboratory in Wuhan, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re hearing the story, and we\u2019ll see \u2026 but we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened.\u201d Secretary of state Mike Pompeo later told Fox News the Wuhan virus lab was near the wet market and said: \u201cThe Chinese government needs to come clean.\u201d\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian did not directly address Trump\u2019s comments during a daily briefing on Thursday. But he did say that World Health Organization\u2019s officials \u201chave said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s comments provoked an angry response from the editor of the state-run Global Times.\nFox News published a ridiculous report claiming COVID-19 originated in a Wuhan lab. President Trump helped hype this story to divert public\u2019s attention. It\u2019s a dirty trick. Trump will further exploit China topic for his reelection campaign.\nThe Pentagon\u2019s top general, Mark Milley, cast doubt on the lab theory this week. Trump had previously drawn condemnation from Beijing by referring to coronavirus as \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d.\nHe is expected to announce new guidelines on Thursday aimed at helping states with low virus transmission rates ease their restrictions sooner than 1 May, claiming some states were \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d.\n\u201cThe battle continues but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases,\u201d he said, without giving details. \u201cHopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress.\n\u201cThese encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalise guidelines on states for reopening the country.\u201d\nMike Pence, who heads the coronavirus task force, said: \u201cThe American people will be encouraged to know as we stand here today, 24% of the counties of this country have no reported coronavirus cases.\u201d\nHowever, US business leaders have warned Trump that a dramatic increase in testing and availability of protective equipment would be needed before they could restart commercial operations, measures echoed by health experts.\nSimilarly, the European Union and embattled WHO have urged caution and co-operation before any steps are taken to ease lockdowns.\nSpain and Italy \u2013 the worst-affected EU nations \u2013 have begun allowing some non-essential workers back to work, and France has said it will start easing restrictions from 11 May.

And then our county cricketers entered the fray.\nJimmy Anderson struck in his first over against Kent, while Ian Bell posted the first hundred at Taunton. Both prompted muffled applause \u2013 it\u2019s hard to make much noise with gloves on \u2013 and there was a sense that the old order was prevailing. All was well with the world.\nYet after four days of uninterrupted cricket there were shocks, and the greatest one took place at Headingley (yet again). There Gloucestershire played in the top division of the championship for the first time in 15 years and they won an extraordinary match by two wickets.\nDawid Malan hit a polished 87 in his first appearance for Yorkshire and on the final day Gloucestershire were set 387 to win. There were important contributions from James Bracey and Miles Hammond \u2013 Gloucestershire always sound more threatening with a Hammond in their ranks \u2013 but the critical innings, an unbeaten 158, came from Cheteshwar Pujara on his return to Headingley.\nPujara, who had been nicknamed \u201cSteve\u201d when he played for Yorkshire, since they could not pronounce his name, was delighted. \u201cI enjoyed my time up here but I enjoyed scoring these runs as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Bristol they call me \u2018Cheteshwar\u2019. I prefer that.\u201d Gloucestershire\u2019s coach, the highly regarded Richard Dawson, smiled discreetly after victory on his old home turf before pointing out that there were 13 games to go.\nLancashire defeated Kent by five wickets at Old Trafford; Anderson finished with seven in the match, which means he needs another 34 to reach 1,000 in first-class cricket \u2013 584 of those have come in Test cricket. Darren Stevens, staying within the national speed limit, took five, while the younger generation was represented by Saqib Mahmood and Harry Podmore (is he the son of Dave, once of the Guardian sports pages?).\nAt Taunton there were runs in abundance in a drawn game. Bell was not the only centurion; Dom Sibley also hit a hundred, as did Matthew Wade on his debut for Somerset; and so did James Hildreth. The umpires marked the pitch as \u201cabove average\u201d, though it is doubtful the spectators agreed. No doubt the ECB were happy with it. The fourth day was a yawn; no run chase was forthcoming because the captains decided the surface was too batsman-friendly to set a target. Both sides took 11 points, which means Somerset remain at the bottom of the table on -1 after the deduction of 12 points for a poor pitch at the end of last season.\nIn the second division Middlesex played Worcestershire, who have been promoted six times in the past 17 seasons. The overseas players prevailed with Middlesex\u2019s new captain, Peter Handscomb, hitting a century, which was matched by Worcestershire\u2019s Hamish Rutherford. On a slow, true pitch it was tough for the batsmen to accelerate, though any spectator drifting into a doze was soon woken by hammering from the builders in the Compton and Edrich stands.\nThere was a more exciting game at Trent Bridge. Nottinghamshire\u2019s latest import, Haseeb Hameed, hit a century on his debut, which was matched by one from the less exalted Hassan Azad of Leicestershire. In the end the home side won with only three overs to spare, when Stuart Broad took the final wicket courtesy of a brilliant diving catch in the gully by Peter Trego, an unlikely Nottinghamshire debutant.\nAt Hove Ravi Bopara began his Sussex career with a polished 62 and Stuart Meaker snatched his first wickets for his new county. But the Durham Kolpaks, David Bedingham and Farhaan Behardien, scored vital runs and there were important wickets for Brydon Carse.\nMark Wood looked on with a broad smile from the balcony and assured everyone, as he usually does in April, that he expects to be fully fit again before long. A delighted captain, Cameron Bancroft, said he would welcome Wood\u2019s firepower for a few games before the Test series against West Indies.\nAt the venues allocated Test matches against West Indies \u2013 the Oval, Edgbaston and Lord\u2019s \u2013 there have been very promising ticket sales that suggest the game is still enjoying a boost after the excitements of 2019.\nLast time West Indies were here, they played the first floodlit Test in this country in Birmingham; this will not happen again this summer, and the number of complaints about the absence of a pink-ball Test cannot be counted on the fingers of one hand \u2013 since that number is zero. In this instance the ECB was quick to recognise a concept that does not work in this country.\nThe counties reported good crowds for the first round of championship matches, and already there are several sell-outs for the Blast.\nMeanwhile there was great excitement at the offices of the ECB as the launch of The Hundred drew nearer. A spokesperson said: \u201cEverything\u2019s going really well. We\u2019ve just received a massive consignment of fireworks and there are boxes galore of Hula Hoops and Butterkist popcorn out the back.\u201d",

In a new report it calls on governing bodies and the game\u2019s stakeholders from across the world to step up, protect players and aspire \u201cto build a more solid foundation\u201d.\n\u201cUnless there is a clear commitment to stabilise competitions and provide financial assistance to keep leagues, clubs and players in business, the economic standstill will ultimately result in insolvencies of otherwise profitable and stable clubs,\u201d it said.\nThe women\u2019s game has been among the worst hit by the pandemic. Fifpro is particularly concerned about how the crisis is exposing the poor and precarious conditions of many of its footballers globally.\n\u201cThe lack of written contracts, the short-term duration of employment contracts, the lack of health insurance and medical coverage, and the absence of basic worker protections and workers\u2019 rights leaves many female players \u2014 some of whom were already teetering on the margins \u2014 at great risk of losing their livelihoods,\u201d it added.\nThe release of Fifpro\u2019s 2020 Raising Our Game \u2013 a comprehensive audit of women\u2019s football \u2013 has been postponed due to the crisis. However, this supplementary report explains that one of the findings shows that many clubs will provide \u201chousing [51% of players surveyed saying they received help with it], health insurance [44%], and food [37%]\u201d instead of financially compensating players, and encourages clubs to \u201censure that players are not left without these essential items as a result of the crisis\u201d.\nInstability is not new to women\u2019s football, explains Fifpro. \u201cThe majority of players have had experience with previous clubs on the verge of bankruptcy or uncertainty around wages at some point.\u201d\nHowever, they have found themselves \u201cleft in the dark\u201d, forced to apply for temporary employment after wage cuts, and some have found themselves isolated in foreign countries \u201cfacing the worst health crisis of the modern era separated from friends, family, and support systems\u201d.\nThe report also warns that while little research exists about the physiological implications of such a dramatic change in mental, emotional, physical and social environments, early insights show \u201csignificant changes in menstrual cycles, with more frequent and severe symptoms, and changes in cycle length and pattern which adds to the stress of the situation\u201d, possibly in part due to changes in training load, diet and sleep.\nThese factors could have an effect on the length of time it takes women to get their bodies reset and match-fit in any pre-season restart.\nWith women\u2019s football at vastly different stages of development from country to country, Fifpro is encouraging governing bodies and stakeholders not to apply a one-size-fits-all approach in their responses, instead encouraging them to look to \u201cspecial financial measures and conditions for female players, clubs, and competitions\u201d.\nThe players\u2019 union is proposing its growth and sustainability should be a central focus of the recovery process while also suggesting that there is an opportunity for the crisis to be seen as an \u201copportunity to address shortcomings in professional women\u2019s football and establish global labour standards for the working conditions of players\u201d.",

It arrived on Sunday, two weeks earlier than planned.\nSince then 668 sailors \u2013 one third of the 1,767-strong crew \u2013 have tested positive, the French defence ministry confirmed. \u201cToday, 31 of them are in hospital, one in intensive care. We do not have the results for 30% of the tests,\u201d it said in a statement.\nThe crew members have been placed in isolation for 14 days before being allowed to rejoin their families.\n\u201cOperations to disinfect the vessel and aircraft have begun,\u201d said the French defence minister, Florence Parly, who added a message of support for the confined sailors and their families.\nThe Charles de Gaulle was docked at Brest on France\u2019s western coast between 13-15 March, where the sailors were given shore leave. This was two days before the country\u2019s strict confinement, as the lockdown is known in France.\nAdm Christophe Prazuck, the navy\u2019s chief of staff, has ordered an inquiry into the contamination of the vessel.\nThe Charles de Gaulle, which carries Rafale fighter planes, Hawkeye surveillance and control aircraft as well as Caracal and Cougar helicopters and Aster surface-to-air missiles, had been on exercise since 21 January and spent several weeks in the Mediterranean as part of Op\u00e9ration Chammal, the French contribution to the international anti-terrorist Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria.\nIt then sailed to the North Sea and then the Atlantic for \u201coperations of security and defence\u201d to European sea routes, said the ministry.\nIn Britain, new aircraft carrier the Queen Elizabeth is due to set sail from Portsmouth for a training exercise later this month, prompting the opposition Labour party to question whether the warship with its 600-strong crew should be setting sail given the fate of its stricken French counterpart.\nJohn Healey, the shadow defence secretary, wrote to Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, on Wednesday to ask whether the UK Ministry of Defence should, in the light of \u201cthe concerning reports\u201d involving the French and other warships, \u201cpostpone large-scale training exercises\u201d.\nThe Royal Navy said it is undertaking special measures to minimise the risk of an outbreak, and that the warship could sail to the UK quickly in the event of a crisis. The British navy believes its aircraft carrier is more modern and less cramped than Charles de Gaulle, and the USS Theodore Rooselvelt, where over 600 have been infected from a crew of 4,000 and one sailor has died after a coronavirus infection got out of control.",

        "content": "Pollution-busting clean air zones in cities have been put on hold, as authorities tackle coronavirus\nThe introduction of pollution-busting clean air zones in cities has been postponed by the coronavirus crisis, as authorities combat the outbreak.\nClean air zones (CAZs), in which the dirtiest vehicles are deterred from urban centres by charges, were due to be implemented in Birmingham, Leeds and Bath this year, but have now been delayed at least to January 2021.\nA zero-emissions zone planned for Oxford in December has also been postponed until summer 2021, while a consultation in Manchester on a clean air zone due this summer has been halted.\nIn London, the congestion charge, low emission zone and ultra low emission zones have all been suspended until further notice and a tightening of standards for the LEZ, due in October, has been pushed back by four months.\nDr Andy Whittamore, a GP in Portsmouth and Asthma UK\u2019s clinical lead, says that viruses are a trigger for asthma and asthma symptoms, and therefore it is fair to assume that coronavirus will act in the same way.\nHealth bodies around the world are listing asthma as a condition that might be considered high risk, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that having asthma increases the infection rate from the coronavirus. There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.\nAsthma is a condition of the airways, causing inflammation. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like  viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.\nThe authorities say the delays are to ease the travel of key workers such as NHS staff and essential deliveries, as well as to allow officials to focus on tackling Covid-19.\nLevels of a key pollutant produced by vehicles, nitrogen dioxide, have been above legal limits in most urban areas for a decade, and the government has been defeated three times in court over the adequacy of its plans. Air pollution is estimated to cause about 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK.\nThe coronavirus lockdown has resulted in traffic plunging to 1955 levels and pollution cut by a third to a half in cities, but experts say this is likely to be short-lived. Early studies have shown that people with long-term exposure to air pollution have much higher death rates from Covid-19, most likely because dirty air increases respiratory and heart problems.\nOn 7 April, the government called on scientists to address \u201curgent short-term questions\u201d related to changes in UK air quality linked to the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, it asked: \u201cBased on what is already known about air pollutants as respiratory irritants or inflammatory agents, can any insights be gained into the impact of air quality on viral infection?\u201d\nAn email from the government\u2019s Joint Air Quality Unit to its stakeholders sent the same day said: \u201cThe national response to the current public health emergency has already impacted on a range of public functions at both local and national level and will continue to do so. In order to provide certainty to those affected by CAZs, we will work with local authorities to delay introducing CAZs until after the Covid-19 outbreak response.\u201d\nKatie Nield, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said: \u201cThe government has committed to keeping any delay to CAZs as short as possible. Given the harm to people\u2019s health caused by air pollution, particularly to those most vulnerable, we think this is essential. In the meantime, it is important that preparatory work to draw up local air quality plans continues so that once the country starts moving again, people can look forward to breathing cleaner air.\u201d\nZak Bond, at the British Lung Foundation, said: \u201cWe are all aware of the importance of good lung health so it\u2019s crucial that, when we are able to, we get the CAZs up and running to protect everybody\u2019s health, including the 12 million people in the UK with an existing respiratory condition and those who will be recovering from Covid-19.\u201d\nJenny Bates, at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe government should have required CAZs in its 2017 plan, but instead only asked councils to consider them along with other measures. They could have been already in place. As we come out of this terrible situation, we must think about what infrastructure we invest in: public transport as well as cycling and walking must be the priority, not more roadbuilding.\u201d\nA government spokeswoman said the delay to CAZs would help the authorities in Leeds, Birmingham and Bath focus on their response to coronavirus.\n\u201cImproving air quality remains a key priority for the UK, which is why we have also launched the call for evidence to ensure we can fully understand the impact that coronavirus is having on changes in air pollution emissions, concentrations and exposure,\u201d she said.\nMany other cities and towns, including Sheffield and Bristol, are considering CAZs, but councils in Coventry, Derby and Nottingham have rejected the idea.",

        "content": "From releasing young people first to immunity passports or a regional approach, several gradual options are available\nWhile ministers and their medical advisers refuse to be drawn on an exit strategy from the UK lockdown, discussions are under way in Whitehall to explore how a graduated return to work could soften the economic blow while avoiding a surge in deaths from the virus. What options are available?\nYoung workers are among the most resilient to the virus, but often the hardest hit financially. A \u201cyouth first\u201d policy would be aimed at releasing them initially, at least in part, so that they can get back to work and soften the financial impact of the epidemic. Research from Warwick University this week made the case for easing restrictions on people in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents. Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee estimate that the move would allow 4.2 million people to return to work, of whom 2.6 million are in the private sector, and get the economy moving again.\n\u201cA young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country,\u201d the authors write.\nAs recent deaths have shown, however, the young are not impervious to the disease. The Warwick group calculate that their youth-first policy could lead to 630 premature deaths. But if all goes well, others could follow them back to the workplace, their order determined by age and type of work.\nShutting schools reduces the spread of coronavirus among pupils and teachers, and creates a distance between parents who have inevitably built up social bonds. But it has a significant impact on economic activity, as so many working parents need time off for childcare and home schooling.\nAn influential review published this week found a \u201cremarkable dearth\u201d of data on the value of school closures during the Sars and Mers outbreaks, but noted that the measure seemed to have relatively little impact on the spread of those coronaviruses.\nMore sophisticated options are available than simply reopening schools en masse, which would risk fuelling a second wave of infections. A more cautious approach might lead to schools staggering their opening hours, lunch and break times, keeping playgrounds closed and class groups constant, introducing more space between students and having a shorter school week.\nThere is a case for opening primary schools first: they tend to be smaller than secondaries and it is predominantly younger children who keep adults from working. That said, the impact of closures on mental health and education are more severe for secondary students.\n\u201cOne problem is that we don\u2019t have much information to guide us,\u201d said Prof Russell Viner at University College London, an author of the review. \u201cWe need to get the clever modellers looking at this, and looking at how these might interact with other elements. But I think society also need to discuss it.\u201d\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/08-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid19lockdown.mp3\nBritain desperately wants an effective antibody test that reveals who has had the virus. Those who test positive for coronavirus antibodies will presumably have some immunity and in principle might be allowed back to work. It could make a dramatic difference for NHS staff and other carers who work with vulnerable people.\nImmunity passports are not straightforward, though. A positive antibody test does not mean that someone is well protected, or protected for long. What the immune response means in the case of this particular disease is still unknown. Another concern with immunity passports is that they blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.\nA gradual easing of restrictions on shops and businesses would help the economy, but the spectre of a second wave of infections is ever present. Certain types of shops could reopen, but with strict limits on hours and numbers. The construction and manufacturing industries have already been sent new guidance from Alok Sharma, the business secretary, who said work could continue if done in line with physical distancing rules \u201cwherever possible\u201d.\nHealth officials will be watching European countries that are starting to relax their own lockdowns. In Austria, where new cases have been falling for some days, the schools will remain closed, but small shops, DIY and garden centres have begun to reopen.\nLondon was hit early, and could already be reaching its peak. One option could be to ease the lockdown there \u2013 a move that would also benefit the economy.\nDr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said he would expect to see a staggered easing of quarantine measures, but that it is a complex process.\n\u201cAll decisions can have foreseen and unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, we may see regional easing of lockdown, but there\u2019s the potential that any such announcement may see increased travel of people into and out of those areas.\u201d\nThere are also concerns that the reasons why London was so heavily affected in the first wave of Covid-19 could mean it is more at risk of a second wave, while there are also questions about the practicalities of easing restrictions region by region.\nProf Keith Neal, an emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, noted that within one region there could be urban and rural areas with very different experiences of the pandemic.\nHe also said there were questions around whether restrictions should be eased only when a peak has passed, noting that there could be some areas, such as remote parts of the UK, which are unlikely to have a large \u201cpeak\u201d. \u201c[In some places], in rural areas, they haven\u2019t had any cases \u2013 so one or two cases will be a peak,\u201d he said.\nUsing temperature screening may seem an attractive way to work out who may have Covid-19, particularly as testing \u2013 even for current infections \u2013 is far from ubiquitous.\nBut Head urged caution. \u201cTaking people\u2019s temperature is a partially useful approach to surveillance, but will miss anyone who is infected that doesn\u2019t have a fever,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, we know that most people are infectious and can spread the coronavirus at least a day or two before showing symptoms. Therefore, monitoring for fever should only be considered as part of a wider package of interventions.\u201d\n Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

The construction firm she worked for was having one of its best years ever when Covid-19 turned the industry upside down. \u201cAs soon as they said shelter in place, my company laid off 20 people,\u201d Hunt said.\nHunt, 47, said a few job opportunities have become available in the small sector of the industry which has oriented itself to emergency services and coronavirus response. But the market is also clogged with newly unemployed people \u2013 eight people Hunt knows well were also laid off in the past few weeks.\nHer former employer, where she worked for more than six years, cut 20% of its jobs and the remaining staff face large pay cuts. Her boss said he was doing what he had to do to keep the company alive.\nDespite the bleak picture, Hunt is hopeful. \u201cI think that this will pass,\u201d said Hunt, who lives outside Sacramento, California, with her three children and her husband, who works in healthcare.\nHunt said: \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but I think when things like this happen you just have to take it day by day.\u201d\nOfficially the unemployment rate was 4.4% in March, rising for the first time after a record 113 months of growth.\nBut the government figures have yet to absorb the record number of new benefit claims, and the real figure is likely to be close to 20%, according to William Rodgers, former chief economist at the Department of Labor and now professor of public policy at the Bloustein school for planning and public policy at Rutgers University.\nThe St Louis federal reserve chair, James Bullard, has predicted the US unemployment rate may hit 30% in the second quarter. There were roughly 163 million people in the US labor force in March, which would equate to the loss of 48.9m jobs.\nReed said unemployment claims were likely to rise at 3 to 6 million a week for weeks to come. \u201cThis could easily move to the summer,\u201d he said.\nThe unemployment claims numbers were the latest in a series of gloomy economic statistics to be released this week. Retail sales fell by a seasonally adjusted 8.7% in March from a month earlier, the biggest month-on-month decline since the records began in 1992.\nMeanwhile, US industrial production fell a seasonally adjusted 5.4% in March, its biggest monthly drop since 1946.\nUnemployment is surging worldwide in the wake of the pandemic. In the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that joblessness could hit 10% by the end of June.\nAustralia is also bracing for 10% unemployment. Spain and Italy are expecting sharp rises in layoffs.\nThis week, the International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for global growth in response to the pandemic and warned that the global slump in economic activity this year would be unparalleled since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\u201cI can say with 100% probability that this will end,\u201d said Reed. \u201cI just don\u2019t know when.\u201d",

Of those 58% were granted settled status and 41% granted pre-settled status.\nOf the remaining applications 10,000 were invalid and 600 were refused, 98% of which were on eligibility grounds and 2% on \u201csuitability grounds\u201d, said the Home Office.\nThe Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said in a report, Not Settled Yet, published on Thursday, that there was no way of verifying whether the government was reaching its goal because there was no official means of doing so, as no registration system existed before for migrants.\nMadeleine Sumption, the director of the research unit, warned that the government could relax thinking it had captured data for all of those eligible to remain in the UK when many may not apply at all.\n\u201cThe government has invested a lot of effort in making the EU settlement scheme easy to use,\u201d she said, \u201cbut with any scheme of this size it is inevitable that some people will fall through the cracks. It will be very hard to know to what extent this has happened, without a parallel investment in new data.\n\u201cFor a host of reasons, it\u2019s possible that the number of EU citizens granted status through the scheme could greatly exceed the current official estimate of 3.4 million but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean the task is finished.\u201d\nThe campaign group the3million said it had concerns that some of the more complex cases were now taking up to six months to resolve, creating anxiety for many families whose lives were put on hold.\nIt also expressed concern over the lack of information about refusals.\n\u201cWe have gone from \u2018nobody is being refused status on eligibility grounds\u2019 to hundreds of refusals per month, without knowing why cases are being refused,\u201d said Maike Bohn, one of the group\u2019s co-founders.\n\u201cThe real question is how many people have not applied, and the government simply doesn\u2019t know it. Every single EU resident to miss the deadline of 30 June 2021, for whatever reason, will automatically lose their legal status in the UK. It is crucial we know how many, who, and where they are \u2013 but we have no data that would allow us to establish this.\u201d\nThe data puts Polish citizens at the top, with 665,000 applicants, but it has been estimated previously there are about a million Poles in the country. Some returned home after Brexit.\nRomanians are the second highest number of applicants by nationality, at 564,300, followed by Italians at 351,600 and Portuguese at 273,000.\nThe Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline and if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they would be given a further opportunity to apply.\nIt also pointed out that the scheme would open beyond 30 June 2021 \u201cnot just for those with reasonable grounds for applying late, but also to accommodate those granted pre-settled status, who will be able in due course to apply for settled status, and close family members living overseas at the end of the transition period (and children born after that date) who later join a resident EEA or Swiss citizen here with status under the scheme\u201d.\n This headline and first paragraph of this article were amended on 16 April 2020 to clarify that 3.4m was the number of applications received; this is not necessarily the same as the number of people who have applied for settled status.",

        "content": "Trend has been replicated in all nations, but scientists cannot yet fathom the cause\nIt has been well publicised that Covid-19 discriminates by age and by underlying health conditions.\nBut it has become increasingly apparent that it also discriminates by sex, with the latest UK data from the Office for National Statistics revealing that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease.\nThe trend was first seen in China, where one analysis found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women.\nSince then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and now in the UK.\nIn Italy, men have accounted for 71% of deaths. In Spain, data released on Thursday suggests twice as many men as women have died and in the UK, of the 4,122 deaths registered, 2,523 were men and 1,599 women.\nSo why are men more vulnerable?\n\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.\nEarly on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to men suffering worse symptoms and outcomes.\nThe smoking hypothesis was backed by a paper, published last month, that found smokers made up about 12% of those with less severe symptoms, but 26% of those who ended up in intensive care or died.\nSmoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.\nBehavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are less likely to wash their hands, less likely to use soap, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.\nHowever, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries \u2013 in the UK, 16.5% of men smoke compared with 13% of women \u2013 the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.\n\u201cThe growing observation of increased mortality in men is holding true across China, Italy, Spain. We\u2019re seeing this across very diverse countries and cultures,\u201d said Sabra Klein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\u201cWhen I see that, it makes me think that there must be something universal that\u2019s contributing to this. I don\u2019t think smoking is the leading factor.\u201d\nPrevious research, including by Klein, has revealed that men have lower innate antiviral immune responses to a range of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. Studies in mice suggest this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied.\n\u201cTheir immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,\u201d Klein said.\nHormones can also play a role \u2013 oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men.\nSex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are taking place across the world. Klein said she had already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. \u201cWe can expect more on this soon,\u201d she said.\nUltimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour were all likely to play a role.\nBut it will only be possible to tease out the exact balance when sex-disaggregated data is more widely available.\nAt the time of speaking, before the latest release by the ONS, Hawkes said it was disappointing that only six out of 20 countries had published such a breakdown for case numbers and deaths, according to figures compiled by Global Health 50/50, which Hawkes leads, and CNN. The latest data revealing significantly more male deaths in the UK adds further weight to concerns that men are more vulnerable when it comes to Covid-19.",

        "content": "Court said firm not doing enough to protect staff and told it to stop selling non-essentials\nAmazon has closed its six French distribution centres, two days after a French court ruled it was not doing enough to protect workers from the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe company is facing mounting scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic as it tries to deal with a surge in online orders during lockdowns while keeping employees safe.\nOn Tuesday a court in Nanterre, Paris, issued an emergency ruling requiring the company to stop selling non-essential goods for a month while it works out new safety measures.\nSales of food, medicine and hygiene supplies are still allowed under the ruling. However, Amazon France said that given the \u201cinherent complexity\u201d of its activities, and the potential \u20ac1m (\u00a3870,000) fine for each violation of the ruling, the risk was too high.\nAmazon France\u2019s chief executive, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Duval, denounced the court\u2019s order on Thursday, saying the company had spent \u201ccolossal amounts\u201d on health precautions including sanitary gels and face masks. He said the firm would appeal.\nDuval said that rather than limiting its activities, Amazon had temporarily suspended trade through the warehouses because the court order was too vague.\n\u201cThere is a huge ambiguity,\u201d he told RTL radio. \u201cIs a nail clipper a hygiene product? Is a condom a medical item? I\u2019m not able to define that.\u201d\nHe said the company would work with unions to ensure the sites could reopen quickly, but added: \u201cI cannot confirm at this stage on what date they will reopen.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s vice-president for the EU, Roy Perticucci, has stepped down, the company confirmed on Wednesday, a day after the ruling.\nThe six warehouses in France employ 10,000 permanent and temporary employees. Amazon will tap a state partial unemployment scheme to pay its employees, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.\nThe shutdown plays into a public war of words between Amazon and the French unions that represent its warehouse workers. In a statement, the company squarely laid the blame for the shutdown on the union complaint that led to the ruling.\nThe Solidaires union, which brought the complaint, said it was merely asking Amazon to enforce a ban on non-essential items that the company \u201chas been claiming for weeks\u201d, and said a similar judgment had been levied against La Poste, the French state postal service, the week before.\nAmazon insisted it was providing adequate security measures for staff, noting the implementation of temperature checks and mask distribution.\nThe company claimed it had sent more than 127,000 packets of disinfectant wipes and 27,000 litres of sanitising gel, as well as 1.5m masks, to the distribution centres.\nBut the court found Amazon had not done enough to enforce physical distancing, to ensure that turnstiles and locker rooms were virus-free, or to increase cleaning of its warehouses. Unions said one worker infected with the virus was in intensive care.\nCustomers who order from third-party companies that use the Amazon website but send items directly will still receive their goods.\nAmazon is no stranger to using shutdowns as a political weapon. In 2018 the company blocked shipments to Australia from its overseas stores after a sales tax was imposed on imported goods. But that standoff came to an end when Amazon backed down six months later, reopening overseas shipments in time for the Black Friday sales.\nThe French labour minister, Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, told LCI radio on Thursday: \u201cI hope, for the sake of Amazon employees and French clients, that business can resume as soon as possible, but with security protocols in place.\u201d",

        "content": "He\u2019s directing the Doctor Strange sequel \u2013 but will the Raimi we get be the indie-horror enfant terrible we want or the Spider-Man 3 dud we don\u2019t? \nThirteen years ago, as Sam Raimi wrapped production on Spider-Man 3, few would have imagined that it would not be until 2020 that the director of The Evil Dead stepped behind the cameras on another superhero movie. But that is exactly where Raimi finds himself after confirming his involvement this week in the Marvel sequel Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. What\u2019s even more remarkable is that this will only be the film-maker\u2019s third new movie since the ill-fated Spidey threequel that saw Tobey Maguire\u2019s run as the masked wall-crawler come to an unceremonious halt.\nSpider-Man 3, as has been well-documented, was a giant egg of a movie, a film reportedly ruined by Sony\u2019s insistence on incorporating the fan-favourite alien symbiote storyline into an episode that already had James Franco\u2019s New Goblin and Thomas Haden Church\u2019s Sandman as major villains. Raimi certainly didn\u2019t help with those god-awful scenes in which Peter Parker is transformed into an arrogant emo youth following his interaction with the symbiote. But was the movie really so bad that the director deserved the best part of a decade and a half in Hollywood purgatory? This, after all, was the same film-maker whose earlier Spidey instalments broke all box-office records for superhero movies and won rapturous critical praise only a few years earlier.\nSince 2007, Raimi has directed only the uproarious Drag Me to Hell, a comic horror nod to his groundbreaking earlier work on Evil Dead II, and the middling fantasy Oz the Great and Powerful, in which he reunited with Franco. Both movies made money and neither is considered a turkey, though the latter film drew only lukewarm reviews. Still, it is surprising that a studio such as Marvel has not made better use of Raimi\u2019s prodigious talents at an earlier stage.\nWhether the film-maker can restore his star to the gilded firmament where it rested at the turn of the century remains to be seen. This is a director who moved from indie-horror enfant terrible to blockbuster big cheese with consummate ease on the early Spider-Man films, but has since struggled with the demands of working within the studio system. After Drag Me to Hell led critics to observe that he was back to his best, Raimi observed that he had enjoyed working again \u201cwith a tight team doing the main jobs\u201d, as opposed to the Spider-Man films where \u201cyou come to rely on a lot of people doing things for you and a lot of help\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing and wonderful to be reminded that, as with most film-makers, the best way to do it is yourself.\u201d\nAnd yet, the Spider-Man movies are unmistakably Raimi-esque in a way in which Oz the Great and Powerful is not, with the film-maker\u2019s trademark lightning-quick edits, delight in unusual perspectives and fondness for looming, ominous shadows. Such gothic intensity was almost completely absent from the Disney fantasy, as Raimi seemed to shrink into himself creatively under the weight of the mouse house\u2019s corporate oversight.\nMarvel has not always been the most comfortable home for maverick film-makers, but it is to be hoped that the studio has picked the perfect vehicle for Raimi to return to superhero flicks. You don\u2019t get any more far-out and psychedelic than 2016\u2019s Doctor Strange, even if that movie\u2019s director, Scott Derrickson, reportedly walked away from the sequel because he wanted it to be more of a horror film than Marvel had envisaged.\nIf the studio can harness all Raimi\u2019s early vigour, his delight in eye-popping visual tomfoolery and his almost unique ability to make the camera itself the most important character, then we ought to be looking at a future classic of the genre. If the Raimi that emerges here is the seemingly restrained director that gave us Oz the Great and Powerful, the results might be less encouraging.\nThere are reasons to be hopeful. Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man films, with their breezy, primary-coloured insouciance, were in many ways the blueprint that Marvel has been following ever since, and one can\u2019t help thinking that their director is finally in his rightful place.

In Tanzania the president has promised that taking communion in church would \u201cburn\u201d the virus away. In Brazil a congressman claimed a day of fasting would halt its spread.\nAnd the leader of the most powerful country in the world, Donald Trump, has been touting as a miracle cure an unproven anti-malarial drug that has contributed to at least one death.\nThere have also been dubious claims about technology. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards announced it had invented a device that can detect coronavirus at a distance of 100 metres, using a magnetic field and \u201cbipolar virus\u201d.\nAnd in the UK, Eamonn Holmes, the presenter of ITV\u2019s This Morning, said \u201cmany people are rightly concerned\u201d, about conspiracy theories linking the roll-out of 5G mobile phone networks to coronavirus, while insisting he did not believe in the hoaxes himself.\nAs the global pandemic has worsened, politicians, faith leaders and other authority figures from around the world have touted unscientific methods to tackle its spread.\nThere are already countless coronavirus-related quack cures, dubious prophylactic schemes or conspiracy theories circulating on social media.\nBut endorsements from influential men and women mean people are much more likely to take false confidence from unscientific cures. At best these are unproven, at worst some may even exacerbate the virus\u2019s spread.\n\u201cCow urine parties\u201d in India brought hundreds of people together to drink the liquid that some Hindus believe has medicinal properties. A BJP party worker in Kolkata, Narayan Chatterjee, was arrested for organising a cow urine consumption competition just as scientists were warning people to avoid large gatherings.\nTanzania\u2019s president, John Magufuli, halted all international flights over Easter, and closed schools and universities and brought in quarantine for visitors.\nBut as he was trying to limit some social gatherings, he also urged people to visit churches and mosques, to pray away the disease in large groups. \u201c[The virus] cannot survive in the body of Christ, it will burn,\u201d he told a packed congregation before Easter. \u201cThat\u2019s why I did not panic while taking holy communion.\u201d\nReligious gatherings of all faiths and denominations have repeatedly proved a vector for infections, even as the most devout insist their faith and God will protect them, with congregations often following their leaders\u2019 guidance to meet.\nIn Israel cases soared in the ultra-orthodox community as much as four to eight times faster than elsewhere in the country, after its leaders dismissed government regulations.\nThe most senior ultra-orthodox rabbi, Chaim Kanievsky, had initially refused to close packed synagogues and religious seminaries. \u201cThe Torah protects and saves,\u201d the 92-year-old said, only in late March relenting and making a call to lone prayer.\nIn Brazil, Marcos Feliciano, a rightwing pentecostal preacher and congressman, promoted an anti-Covid \u201cday of abstinence\u201d on Sunday 5 April, claiming the fasting would produce a miracle to heal Brazil.\nIt was sanctioned by Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose response to the coronavirus crisis has been denounced as reckless, paranoid and anti-science. Like Trump, he has touted the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine.\nAuthorities in the Indian state of Kashmir have focused on 10-15 million poplar trees, which they argue \u201cmay prove fatal to the public health\u201d by causing hay fever, and have ordered large-scale felling as part of anti-Covid efforts.\nEvery April the trees shed cotton-like balls; officials say these could cause allergies, with the resulting sneezing and coughing spreading coronavirus. Doctors have questioned this, while activists and conservationists warned the felling would damage the environment and local economy.\nA more ostensibly hi-tech response came from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, which claimed its new device only needed to be placed in front of coronavirus for five seconds to detect its presence.\nThe force\u2019s commander in chief, Hossein Salami, claimed an 80% success rate for the \u201camazing scientific phenomenon\u201d that would be used for mass screening, and added it could be \u201ca very good basis for any kind of virus\u201d.\nIn videos of the unveiling, the purported new technology resembled fake bomb-detectors once sold to Iraq and Afghanistan by a convicted British fraudster.\nTraditional and herbal medicine have been promoted by authority figures around the world, to the consternation of their own governments, world health bodies and even social media firms trying to tackle fake news.\nIn Venezuela, where the crippled health system was barely coping before coronavirus, the authoritarian president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, suggested on Twitter that lemongrass and elderberry tea could ward off Covid-19.

He gave no details.\nHe has previously been warned by the World Health Organization against making claims about alternative treatments.\nAnd the makers of Hennessy cognac warned Kenyans against believing it would protect them from Covid-19 after the governor of Nairobi, Mike Sonko, urged people to drink alcohol and included bottles of cognac in food handouts for the vulnerable.\nAn Indian cabinet minister, Shripad Naik, claimed Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, had recovered from coronavirus with the help of Ayurvedic cures. The prince\u2019s spokesman rejected the reports and said he followed NHS medical advice.\nIn Nigeria, the health minister, Osagie Ehanire, was forced to mobilise after the traditional ruler of the kingdom of Ife claimed a combination of plants including onions, African pepper and neem tree were effective against Covid-19, and said the pandemic had been foretold in June last year.\nEhanire warned that government approval was needed for any treatment, and traditional medicines needed to go through the same scientific tests as all drugs.",

Facebook\u2019s policy has been to remove those posts from the platform.\nUnder the new policy, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks, users who liked, shared, commented or reacted with an emoji to such posts before they were deleted will see a message in their news feed directing them to a \u201cmyth busters\u201d page maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\u201cWe want to connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook,\u201d said Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice-president of integrity, in a blogpost.\nFacebook does not take down other misinformation about Covid-19, such as conspiracy theories about the virus\u2019s origins, but instead relies on its third-party factchecking system. If a factchecker rates a claim false, Facebook then adds a notice to the post, reduces its spread, alerts anyone who shared it, and discourages users from sharing it further.\nThe announcement coincides with the release of a new report by the online activist group Avaaz that highlights Facebook\u2019s shortcomings in counteracting the coronavirus \u201cinfodemic\u201d. The study found examples of coronavirus misinformation remaining on the platform even after third-party fact checks had been completed. Avaaz also cited delays in Facebook applying factchecking labels to posts.\nFacebook challenged the methodology of Avaaz\u2019s report but said it \u201cappreciated their partnership in developing the notifications we\u2019ll now be showing people\u201d.\nAvaaz celebrated Facebook\u2019s decision to show notifications to users exposed to misinformation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been calling on Facebook to take this step for three years now,\u201d said Fadi Quran, Avaaz\u2019s campaign director. \u201cIt\u2019s a courageous step by Facebook. At the same time, it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\nThe group wants Facebook\u2019s notifications to be more explicit about the misinformation that the user was exposed to, and it wants the notification shown to any user who saw the misinformation in their news feed, regardless of whether they interacted with the post.\n\u201cWe think that correcting the record retroactively \u2026 will make people more resilient to misinformation in the future, and it will disincentivize malicious users,\u201d said Quran.\nBut Facebook cited concerns that more explicit messages could do more harm than good.\nMisinformation researchers at First Draft News, for example, have long counseled that repeating a false claim, even to debunk it, can help to reinforce it in a person\u2019s mind.\nClaire Wardle, the US director of First Draft News, said that she generally shared Facebook\u2019s concern that repeating the misinformation in a notification could have a negative effect. Wardle usually advises debunkers of misinformation to \u201clead with the fact\u201d, but she noted that such a rule is difficult to follow in relation to the pandemic, where scientific understanding of the virus is continuously evolving.\nWardle welcomed the move by Facebook as a signal that the company was trying to be \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201cbraver\u201d, while warning that there could be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d. Among the potential pitfalls she flagged is the fact that people in different countries have different levels of trust in the WHO.\n\u201cI like this and want to support it, but also want to recognize that we know so little that this could go horribly wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I hope is that they are testing this with some independent academics.\u201d",

That means that if the NHS goes ahead with its original plans, its app would face severe limitations on its operation.\nThe app would not work if the phone\u2019s screen was turned off or if an app other than the contact tracer was being used at the same time. It would require the screen to be active all the time, rapidly running down battery life, and would leave users\u2019 personal data at risk if their phone was lost or stolen while the app was in use.\nA spokesperson for NHSX \u2013 the the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 denied claims of a \u201cstandoff\u201d, saying: \u201cThis suggestion is completely wrong. Everyone is in agreement that user privacy is paramount, and while our app is not dependent on the changes they are making, we believe they will be helpful and complementary.\u201d \nThe limitations mirror problems faced by Singapore, which released its contact-tracing app, TraceTogether, before Apple and Google announced their policies. The app, which has a three-star rating on Singapore\u2019s App Store, has been installed by just 12% of the population.\n\u201cThe important thing here is, if you want your iPhones to work with this in your country, then you\u2019ll need to effectively adhere to Apple\u2019s standard of privacy for the system,\u201d said Dr Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at UCL.\n\u201cApple have said that the standard of privacy that they are demanding is a decentralised system. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to get iPhones to work with it without a workaround that will just stop people using it.\u201d\nThe limits exist because modern smartphones tightly control what apps can do with technologies such as Bluetooth, in order to prevent infringements of privacy. On iPhones, for example, a normal app has strictly limited access to Bluetooth unless it is running in the \u201cforeground\u201d \u2013 meaning actively on screen and in use \u2013 in order to prevent apps from surreptitiously tracking users without consent.\nThe NHS had been hoping those limits would be lifted for Covid-19 contact-tracing apps, according to a source with knowledge of the app development.\nOn Friday in a joint announcement, Apple and Google announced their intention to do that, introducing a new set of tools that public health authorities could use from May to build apps that can perform contact tracing in the background.\nBut the new tools, which come in the form of an API that lets developers code apps with special access to Bluetooth, strictly limit the information that public health authorities can gather. Most importantly, a public health authority cannot ask a phone to gather a list of every other phone it has been in contact with.\nInstead, it can only perform a much more limited version of contact tracing, which involves sending every phone in the system a list of other phones that have been reported as contagious, and asking them, in effect, \u201chave you seen this phone?\u201d said Veale.\nThe limits will prevent the NHS from obtaining useful information about population flows in the aggregate, tracking \u201cnear misses\u201d or receiving information about contacts from people who have opted into the system but not recently checked their phones.\nOn a press call to journalists on Tuesday evening, Google said those limits were in place because neither company wanted to provide functionality in their operating systems to allow for surveillance efforts that could be abused.",

If it were to go up to 1.2, hospitals could reach a crisis point in July, and if it went up to 1.3 the crisis point would come in June.\nMerkel\u2019s calculation, which came at the end of Wednesday night\u2019s press conference, has received more attention abroad than in Germany, where the public is accustomed to the strengths and weaknesses that come with her scientific training.\nLothar de Maizi\u00e9re, the last East German premier who recommended Merkel for her first role in politics, has said her scientific background made her an outsider in a political arena dominated by men with law degrees, but also enabled her rise.\n\u201cShe knows that for every effect there has to be a cause and maybe also ideal conditions,\u201d he told the Merkel biographer Evelyn Roll. \u201cShe knows the laws of formal logic and is therefore capable of building logical chains with speed and determination.\u201d\nAsked why she decided to study physics as a young woman, Merkel has said it helped her to keep an independent mind in an overtly ideological system: \u201cBasic mathematical calculations and the laws of nature cannot be suspended, even in the GDR [East Germany]. Two and two makes four, even under [the former East German leader Erich] Honecker.\u201d\nWas there anything politicians could learn from scientists, one German journalist once asked her. \u201cGravity,\u201d Merkel responded. \u201cWithout mass, no depth.\u201d",

The UK must play a full part in this.\n\u201cWe must also consider the awful risk of abuse within households escalating due to the lockdown. Charities like ChildLine and the NSPCC provide a literal lifeline for desperately vulnerable children and young people. Support for these services and \u2013 by extension \u2013 the vulnerable children who rely on them, must be absolute. The government must not shy away from leadership on this issue.\u201d\nAmong the letter\u2019s signatories are the Tory MPs Mike Penning and Daniel Poulter and the shadow minister for international development, Yasmin Qureshi.\nThis month the National Crime Agency (NCA) said its most recent intelligence showed there were at least 300,000 people in the UK who posed a sexual threat to children, either through physical contact abuse or online.\nThe agency revealed that early on during the Covid-19 crisis offenders were discussing opportunities over online chat forums to abuse children.\nThe NSPCC has said a shortage of moderators who combat sexual abuse online, combined with children spending more time on the internet at home, has created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d.\nLast month Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said third-party US content moderators would be working from home and the company would increase its use of artificial intelligence to moderate content during the coronavirus crisis.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Home Office is leading the work across government to keep children safe online throughout this health pandemic. We are working with law enforcement partners including the NCA and third-sector organisations including Childnet and the NSPCC to provide protection and support to carers, parents and children.\n\u201cThe safety of children is paramount and we continue in all our efforts to ensure that there is no safe space online for sick predators to exploit children.\u201d\nThe freephone ChildLine number is 0800 1111.

We need to reach 100,000 tests by the end of the month and that is what we are working hard on.\n\u201cTesting is going to be hugely important to finding the key to unlocking the way out of this pandemic and we need to keep working hard at it.\u201d\nThe government had targeted a goal of ramping up testing at NHS and PHE laboratories to 25,000 a day by the middle of April. It appears now to have met that capacity with the help of private drive-through sites, despite Matt Hancock, the health secretary, denying that target at Wednesday\u2019s press conference.\nHowever, it is still a long way from actually completing the number of tests that it has the capacity to process.\nExperts have warned that mass testing and contact tracing is critical for being able to ease the UK\u2019s lockdown gradually with no big resurgences of coronavirus.\nProf Neil Ferguson, whose team\u2019s modelling was central to the government bringing in the lockdown, said on Thursday there now needed to be a \u201csingle-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing\u201d.\nHe argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks, pointing to the model of South Korea, which has been suppressing new outbreaks.\n\u201cWithout that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much then we will see a resurgence in transmission,\u201d he said.\nHe said it was necessary to ease restrictions at the right time but added: \u201cWe will have to retain some level of social distancing indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.\u201d\nA new report from the Policy Exchange thinktank has called for a cross-government and multi-agency 24-hour national testing and tracing command centre to overcome the crisis.\nThe report, co-authored by Richard Walton, the former head of counterterrorism command at the Metropolitan police, said a new centre to introduce digital contact tracing at scale should be led by a single individual experienced in command, control, co-ordination and communication.\nSuch a body would include analysts and intelligence professionals from public health, the NHS, local government, police, military, intelligence agencies, private sector and other government departments, modelled on similar examples in Taiwan and Singapore and those within UK counterterrorism.",

I\u2019ve booked and paid in full for two self-catering breaks, one in May and another in July. As with many people who book accommodation-only, I didn\u2019t take out insurance. I\u2019m about \u00a31,000 out of pocket as both companies are refusing to refund me, even though I paid the full balance long before I had to. They are only offering to defer the date but that is only helpful if I can get the time off work and the accommodation I originally booked is available. What is the best course of action?\u201d\nSeveral readers have asked about self-catering holidays in the UK that have been cancelled due to the lockdown. Are they entitled to a refund? While the Package Travel Regulations extend to package holidays in the UK, they do not cover accommodation-only bookings. Each accommodation provider has its own terms and conditions. Since quarantine, the majority have updated their terms to offer a change of date or credit note instead of a refund. Frustratingly, most providers are advising guests who want a refund to claim on their holiday insurance, even though, like Nick, few people take out insurance for a UK holiday. For Nick, the best, in fact the only, course of action is to accept the postponement and hope the companies he booked with will be flexible with new dates. The same advice applies to anyone with an accommodation booking: the only option is to contact the provider directly.\nExamples of companies offering credit notes or flexible booking include: Under the Thatch, a collection of holiday cottages mostly in Wales, which has introduced a flexible booking policy allowing anyone with a cottage stay due to start before 1 September 2020 to postpone to a later date in 2020 or 2021. Most property owners with accommodation on Sawday\u2019s and Canopy and Stars websites are also offering to change the date of the booking \u2013 or provide a credit note for a future booking. For cottages.com, bookings up to 22 May can be transferred for up to 12 months. It is not accepting new bookings before 4 June.",

Previously it said there were fewer than 10 cases.\nLabour has called for the government to publish data on how many service personnel have been tested, amid concerns that the British armed forces could fall victim to an outbreak of the type that has affected the US and French navies.\nResponding to the latest figures, John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: \u201cThese concerning figures make Labour\u2019s case for greater protections and more testing of forces personnel even stronger. Our armed forces keep us safe. It is vital we do the same for them.\u201d\nNearly 600 sailors serving onboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier tested positive for coronavirus, and one died, after an outbreak got out of control in the confines of the warship.\nMore than 600 cases emerged on the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is due to take part in an sea training exercise off the coast of the UK later this month, with a crew of around 600 onboard.\nThe MoD has been reluctant to release statistics about how many armed forces personnel have been tested or how many forces personnel are ill or absent from duty, at a time when the government as a whole is under pressure over whether it is able to test NHS and social care staff.\nForces personnel have voiced concern about the lack of testing in suspected cases, while soldiers placed on standby have complained they are being housed in barracks conditions, where social distancing is not always practised, particularly during training.\nGen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff, said that around 3,000 forces personnel were helping to carry out a number of frontline tasks in the UK, including 200 working in the ambulance services, as well as assisting the emergency delivery of protective equipment, oxygen and ventilators for hospitals.\nEngineers and planners were increasingly becoming involved in the desperate efforts to expand the UK\u2019s coronavirus testing capability. Carter said that armed forces were looking at developing prototype \u201cpop-ups, like mobile libraries\u201d to provide testing services to care homes and remote communities.\n\u201cThe military is involved in trying to construct that and create prototypes that could be let out to industry in short order,\u201d Carter said. Defence scientists at the Porton Down lab in Wiltshire were also \u201cproviding valuable help to testing and the way testing will be conducted in the future\u201d, the forces chief said.\nThe MoD has tried to adopt a relatively low profile during the coronavirus crisis, and where it has been deployed it has largely sought to do so away from the public eye. Insiders insist that they do not expect soldiers to be deployed to protect public order.\n\u201cOur role is very much in support of the heroic healthcare workers on the frontline,\u201d the general added.",

        "content": "Airlines hard hit by Covid-19 look for ways to protect staff and travellers and restore confidence\nThe peak season for airlines should have started this Easter, when millions of passengers go on holiday and leisure trips through to September. Instead, carriers around the world have been forced to ground their fleets due to travel restrictions imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nDuring this standstill, wider questions are occupying the industry: what steps would allow flying to restart, what will the pandemic mean for air travel, and will airlines \u2013 those that survive \u2013 ever be quite the same again?\nImmediate health-led restrictions\nAs Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), put it: \u201cWe are not expecting to restart the same industry that we closed a few weeks ago.\u201d\nAirlines are talking to regulators now for guidelines over how travel might resume while coronavirus remains a smaller, but uncertain, risk. Social distancing at airports and on planes is likely to persist, potentially reducing the number of occupied seats. EasyJet has said it expects to leave middle seats on planes empty as a short-term measure, to reduce the level of contact \u2013 a less onerous restriction while demand is low. Deeper cleaning of aircraft seems likely, and potentially the wearing of masks onboard.\nDe Juniac noted that China\u2019s airline travel restrictions are tougher now than during the height of its own outbreak, to limit reinfection from abroad \u2013 and national public health authorities and governments will dictate the procedures. But Iata hopes to find global consensus on sanitary measures to enable air travel again. Screening of travellers could be necessary: passenger temperatures were taken after the Sars crisis and a comparable coronavirus test, should one become widely available, could eventually restore confidence. Emirates announced it had trialled a rapid blood test, where the results are available in 10 minutes, on all passengers on one flight from Dubai to Tunisia this week.\nThe next industry shutdown could be swift\nHypermobility brought a disease from a Chinese city to just about everywhere before serious flight restrictions were put in place. There will be no delay next time. Any signs of a new virus outbreak \u2013 or a second wave of coronavirus \u2013 would surely be met with far quicker measures to block international flights, rather than leaving it to airlines to respond to falling demand in the months after a virus is detected.\nPublic demand \u2013 and trust\nAviation\u2019s optimists talk of pent-up demand for holidays; others wonder how many passengers will want to risk a vacation abroad. Many of the last European leisure trips were for ski resorts which proved, like cruise ships, major incubators and exporters of Covid-19. The depth of the accompanying economic recession will also be a factor. Airline analyst John Strickland, of JLS Consulting, says: \u201cEven if they have the money to fly, I think people will be apprehensive. Normal summer markets like Spain and Italy, even if they wanted to receive people commercially, might not welcome visitors now.\u201d\nAndrew Charlton, an aviation consultant, is also damning of the airlines\u2019 \u201ctin-eared response\u201d to the crisis by offering vouchers rather than refunds to customers on cancelled flights, in a desperate attempt to save cash. \u201cYes, passengers will travel by banking their vouchers \u2026 But people being burnt by that now aren\u2019t going to book ahead in future \u2013 it\u2019s collapsing confidence in booking.\u201d\nThe end of business travel\nHealth fears initially made companies halt work trips; now it is an expense that struggling firms will likely shelve. Strickland says: \u201cSome of those businesses will have disappeared, others have put travel bans in place, and all have discovered the joys of videoconferencing \u2013 the lucrative premium cabins on long-haul flights won\u2019t be full for a while. Whether all this is a permanent structural change remains to be seen, but even if it is not for ever, it will be a long recovery.\u201d\nSmaller planes, and fewer of them\nCoronavirus looks to have hastened the demise of the world\u2019s biggest planes, built for long-haul: both the relatively young Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-400, the original jumbo, were on their way out anyway. Both models were among the first to be grounded this year as demand fell.\nGerman carrier Lufthansa has announced it would be permanently axing half its modern A380s, and retiring a similar number of its 747s early. Charlton thinks it is just the start: \u201cYou will never see a 747 flying again, and the only A380s will have Emirates painted on the side.\u201d\nIs the environmental gain permanent?\nCoronavirus has meant a bigger instant fall in emissions than any green campaigner could have dared to dream. Many now demand that state bailouts of bankrupt carriers should have environmental conditions attached.\nIata has said the industry remains committed to green targets \u2013 but airlines may be more reluctant to proclaim net-zero ambitions or invest in sustainable jet fuel plants. Already the UN-backed global offsetting scheme, Corsia, could face renegotiation. And while bigger carriers will jettison older planes, they may also decide to defer orders, as easyJet has done for part of a \u00a34.5bn Airbus contract, to bring in new, lower-emitting aircraft.\nWill air travel get more expensive?\nAnalysis by US-based Dollar Flight Club, based on patterns after previous crises, predicts average fare falls of 35% through 2021, but for prices to then double by 2025.\nFlights will get cheaper as airlines desperately try to sell tickets \u2013 and then rise substantially as capacity falls, Charlton believes. \u201cIn the short term, the Ryanairs of this world are going to bomb the market with cheap seats to get revenues to survive. Others will try to match that and will collapse.\u201d Capacity will then fall and fares rise, as supply is squeezed.\nThe widespread industry consensus is that there will be fewer airlines as the industry consolidates via mergers, takeovers and bankruptcies. Iata has warned of mass insolvencies should the grounding persist beyond May. Already, airlines would have started summer schedules \u2013 meaning fuller, far more profitable flights. Instead, Iata said this week it now expects to lose more than half its annual revenues in 2020, a $314bn (\u00a3249bn) decline.\nStrickland says: \u201cAirlines are going to fall by the wayside. I feel sadly sure that aviation is going to be much smaller.\u201d",

For years, Google\u2019s version of the test, branded reCaptcha, has dominated, after it acquired the company that developed it in 2009 and offered the technology for free worldwide.\nGoogle\u2019s introduction of charges for the service has prompted Cloudflare, a little-known firm that protects around 12% of the internet from bot attacks, to seek an alternative.\nThe company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Matthew Prince, said: \u201cIt would have added millions of dollars in annual costs just to continue to use reCaptcha for our free users. That was finally enough of an impetus for us to look for a better alternative.\u201d\nCloudflare had long been uneasy about using Google\u2019s service, Prince added. \u201cSome customers have expressed concerns. Google\u2019s business is targeting users with advertising; Cloudflare\u2019s is not. We have strict privacy commitments. We were able to get comfortable with the privacy policy around reCaptcha, but understood why some of our customers were concerned about feeding more data to Google.\u201d\nChina\u2019s block on Google was an additional concern, he said.\nCloudflare will instead use a similar service, hCaptcha, developed by Intuition Machines, a California startup. The tool has a wider range of tests than reCaptcha, including one asking users to draw a box around a specific object, or to identify the correct label for a picture.\nGoogle\u2019s reCaptcha had been free for so long because, as well as testing whether a site visitor is a robot, it uses humans to do menial tasks. The first version asked users to transcribe hard-to-read words from scanned books, while later versions used similar technology to get people to label images. This helped Google\u2019s image recognition software to tell the difference between, say, cats and dogs, and later taught the company\u2019s self-driving cars and mapping vehicles how to recognise street signage.\nThe tool was developed in part by the Guatemalan entrepreneurLuis von Ahn, who used a similar idea to create the first version of the language-learning app Duolingo.\nIn the past, that value exchange was enough to keep Google\u2019s tools free, but recently the company added an enterprise tier for corporate users who make more than a million calls a month, charging undisclosed fees. \u201cIn our case,\u201d says Prince, \u201cthat would have added millions of dollars in annual costs just to continue to use reCaptcha for our free users.\u201d\nUsers might not immediately welcome the replacement, however, because for all the difference behind the scenes,the tests that hCaptcha poses can be very similar to Google\u2019s. A sample on hCaptcha\u2019s website asks users to click through 9 to 27 images and select those which show a train.\n\n This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because, due to an editing error, an earlier version said hCaptcha was created by Cloudflare.",

An inquest is to be held but there are no suspicious circumstances and Cope is not believed to have contracted Covid-19.\nLast week Cope posted a message on social media saying she was missing her family, weightlifting and her freedom. She concluded the post by saying she would dedicate her time to helping others and urged everyone to stay at home.\nJason Killens, the chief executive of the Welsh ambulance service, said: \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we can confirm the sudden death of one of our paramedics on Monday evening.\n\u201cCharlotte Cope, who was based in Gelli, Rhondda Cynon Taf, was a much-loved member of the Welsh ambulance service family having joined the organisation in 2018 after qualifying as a paramedic.\n\u201cWe would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Charlotte\u2019s family, who we are supporting through this difficult time.

By Thursday afternoon more than \u00a311,000 had been donated.\nQuinn said Cope was promising, proud and adored by all who knew her. He said: \u201cHer heartwarming nature could be felt by everyone in her presence to which she was completely oblivious. This made her all the more special. I think I am speaking on behalf of all her friends and colleagues when I say we are heartbroken and devastated.\n\u201cTo her she was just another ordinary girl, but to us she was that one little bit of happiness and cheer we are often looking for within the ambulance service especially at these unpredictable times.\u201d\nPeople whom Charlotte had helped also paid tribute. One said: \u201cThank you Charlotte for helping save our daughter\u2019s life you have gained your angel wings far too early.\u201d Another said she had been looking after a relative the day before she died.\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "content": "Competition for places remains strong in London, Birmingham and other hotspots \nThousands of families in England have failed to secure a place for their child in their first choice of primary school amid continuing high demand in London, Birmingham and other hotspots across the country.\nWhile schools remain largely closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, families across the country received emails on national primary offer day on Thursday, informing them which school their child will go to in September.\nAfter a spike in the birthrate beginning in the early 2000s, there has been a gradual flattening in the number of four- and five-year-olds enrolling in primary school. But some local authorities reported an increase in applications this year and a fall in the proportion of children getting into their first-choice school.\nCompetition for places remains intense in London, where applications have increased, reversing last year\u2019s trend. Of the 97,300 pupils who applied for a primary school place in the capital, less than 85% got into their first choice, down from 86% last year, and 5,000 children did not get into any of their top three schools.\nBirmingham also experienced an increase in applications, taking the total to more than 14,400, which has had a similar effect on the success rate of applications. The percentage of families getting their first choice slipped from 89% last year to just under 88%.\nFor families wishing to appeal, the Department for Education has announced plans to temporarily relax regulations so that hearings can go ahead despite the Covid-19 restrictions. They will no longer need to be attended in person.\nRichard Long, Kent county council\u2019s cabinet member for education and skills, said: \u201cSince the partial closure of all our schools last month, everyone involved in the provision of education has \u2026 been working in challenging circumstances, and it is a credit to them that we are still able to release offers today.\u201d\nIn Kent, where primary schools will welcome almost 18,000 pupils in September \u2013 their biggest cohort in four years \u2013 just over 88% gained a place in their top choice, 97% got into one of their three preferred schools, and just over 450 did not get any of their preferences.\nLong said: \u201cI appreciate that for those families who did not receive one of their preferences there will be feelings of disappointment and concern today. I would like to reassure them that this is just the first stage of the application process.\n\u201cFamilies have the option to appeal or join a waiting list for an alternative school if they are not happy with their allocation and there is likely to be considerable movement between now and September as families do not take up places they are offered.\u201d\nDevon also saw a big jump in the number of families applying for a place in reception this September, with more than 7,500 applications, up 300 on last year. Almost 95% of families got their first preference and 98% got into one of their top three.\nIn York, the percentage of families given their first choice fell from 96% last year to 94%; in Reading, Berkshire, 83% of children got their first preference, while in nearby Wokingham, 85% got their top choice, also a drop on 2019.\nIn Manchester, where there has previously been high demand, applications fell from 7,057 last year to 6,921. As a result, 92.1% of families got their first choice compared with 90.9% in 2019, and 97.8% of applicants got one of their top three choices, up from 97.2% last year.\nJust over 97% of families in the East Riding of Yorkshire got their first pick, in Derbyshire it was 95%, and in Wiltshire 94%. In contrast, in London\u2019s Kensington and Chelsea, the figure dropped to 70%, in Hammersmith and Fulham it was 73% and in Camden 75%.\nGail Tolley, spokesperson for the Pan-London Admissions Board and strategic lead for children and young people at Brent Council, said: \u201cCoordinating more than 97,000 applications to primary schools across 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation is always a complex task \u2013 and this year the coronavirus pandemic has put even more pressure on boroughs.\n\u201cThanks to the hard work of our admissions teams, we can reassure families that the process has gone smoothly and the vast majority of children \u2013 97% \u2013 will receive an offer for a reception place at one of their preferred schools.\u201d\nIn 2019, 90.6% of pupils were offered their first choice of primary school and 97.5% of pupils were offered one of their top three.",

They made the arrest last month and the person detained has been released while inquiries continue.\nObbink, 63, has denied any wrongdoing, and has said the claims are a \u201cmalicious attempt\u201d to harm his reputation and damage his career.\nIt is alleged that materials held at the Sackler Library had ended up in the US, in a collection belonging to the Museum of the Bible in Washington DC. It was founded in 2017 by the Green family, billionaire American evangelical Christians who own Hobby Lobby, a chain of crafting stores.\nObbink was suspended from duties at Oxford in October 2019 after an investigation into the disappearance of ancient papyrus fragments from the Oxyrhynchus collection, cared for in the Sackler Library and owned by the Egypt Exploration Society (EES).\nThe EES says the materials were removed from Oxford University premises and allegedly sold to the Museum of the Bible.\nDr Carl Graves, the EES director, said the society had given statements to the police investigation about what had gone missing. He said the Museum of the Bible had been cooperative and the missing fragments \u2013 13 in total \u2013 had been returned.\nGraves said: \u201cThese are early fragments of the gospels or biblical fragments. They are testament to Egypt\u2019s early Christian heritage and are early evidence of biblical scripture. We don\u2019t value them monetarily but they are priceless and irreplaceable.\u201d\nSome of the fragments in the collection contain only one or two words, while others are larger, and Graves said it had taken decades of work to piece them together. The fragments come from Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy, among others.\nIn a statement, Obbink previously told the Guardian he denied any wrongdoing. \u201cThe allegations made against me that I have stolen, removed or sold items owned by the Egypt Exploration Society collection at the University of Oxford are entirely false,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI would never betray the trust of my colleagues and the values which I have sought to protect and uphold throughout my academic career in the way that has been alleged. I am aware that there are documents being used against me which I believe have been fabricated in a malicious attempt to harm my reputation and career.\u201d\nThe Guardian has previously reported that Obbink was involved in two businesses, the Castle Folio and Oxford Ancient, which operated in an office located above a branch of TK Maxx in the city.\nThe arrest was first reported by the Oxford Blue, a student paper.",

The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April.\nThe UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19, confirmed the extension following advice from the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage).\nRaab said: \u201cThe government has decided that the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks.\u201d\nHe said Sage had advised that \u201crelaxing any of the measures in place\u201d would \u201cundo the progress we have made\u201d and would \u201crisk damage to both public health and the economy\u201d.\nThere were 861 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals reported on Thursday, taking the total past 13,000.\nMore than 22 million American have lost their jobs in the last four weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the US.\nThe US labour department announced that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March, when nationwide stay-at-home orders led to an unprecedented wave of layoffs across the country.\nThe largest number of people to ask for unemployment benefits in a four-week period before the Covid-19 crisis came in 1992, when 2.7 million sought support.\nScott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, said the country had succeeding in flattening the infection curve but that a \u201cmore extensive surveillance regime\u201d needed to be implemented if they were to forge \u201cthe road out\u201d of lockdown.\nHe praised the extensive testing and contact-tracing system in place and the actions from states to open testing to anyone with symptoms.

There does seem to be a real swell of support from people to do this.\u201d\nShe said workers who had been furloughed were allowed to top up their income through farm work, and many others who had lost their jobs would see it as a lifeline, as well as a way to help the country through the coronavirus crisis.\nWorkers have been flown in this week on charter flights from Romania, despite travel restrictions and fears for their health and safety. Germany has also been recruiting farm workers by air from eastern Europe. About 80,000 workers are likely to be needed this year, leading to calls for a \u201cland army\u201d of paid workers to join farms.\nBatters said there was still time for more people to sign up, as the critical period for the UK\u2019s harvest would not begin until next month. \u201cWe will know much more when we get to May,\u201d she said.\nHowever, even if the labour shortages are less severe than some have predicted, farmers across the country are still facing a struggle to stay in business as their supply chains have been turned upside down by the coronavirus crisis.\nFor farmers, the biggest single problem is that before the lockdown about half of the food consumed in the UK was eaten outside the home, in cafes, restaurants and pubs. Now they are closed, supermarkets are struggling to keep up with demand for grocery shopping, but farmers used to supplying the catering trade have few ways of getting their produce to consumers. \u201cIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to switch,\u201d said Batters.\nFood must meet different standards when sold through supermarkets, and adapting the supply chain takes longer than farmers have to sell their perishable produce. \u201cIf you\u2019re a potato farmer, and you sold to fish and chip shops, you can\u2019t just start selling your produce direct. You can sell some at the end of the farm drive, but that\u2019s only going to make a small difference,\u201d said Batters.\nMinisters have been slow to act, said Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. \u201cWe have heard very little from the government on how they will be supporting farmers to effectively make this transition and we urge them to look at appropriate ways to deliver a clear food delivery strategy that supports short, sustainable supply chains during the pandemic and beyond,\u201d he said.\nSelling directly to consumers remains difficult, even for farmers who have set up their business that way. Charlie Cole, a livestock farmer at Broughgammon farm in Northern Ireland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute nightmare. Our business is completely dependent on us selling directly to the customer. So now that the government restrictions are in place, the farmers\u2019 markets and street food events have come to a close and we\u2019ve had to shut the cafe in the farm shop, which are all usually reliable sources of income.\u201d\nThe cancellation of Wimbledon means its strawberry supplier in Kent is faced with 33 tonnes of perishable soft fruit with no market. Marion Regan, whose great-grandfather established Hugh Lowe Farms in Kent in 1893 with a Covent Garden stall, is now looking at alternatives. \u201cWe will find a home for them,\u201d she told the Oxford Farming Conference podcast. She said she was talking to food banks as well as commercial outlets.\nThe difference between what we eat at home and our tastes when eating out is also causing problems. Our love of mince is a menace to livestock farmers, who have seen the meat market collapse even while supermarkets have been stocking their shelves with meat imported from Poland. People are eating far more mince, which is cheap and comes from the tougher end of the animal, instead of the more expensive cuts, such as steak, that we tend to choose when eating out.\nAs farmers need to sell whole carcasses, they are forced to sell at far below the true value. \u201cIf everyone wants mince, the carcass is massively devalued,\u201d said Batters. \u201cPeople want to buy British beef. If it has to be mince, OK, but you must balance the carcass [if necessary by mincing prime cuts] and stabilise the price, or people will go out of business.\u201d\nCoffee shops used to account for a large proportion of the UK\u2019s fresh milk sales, but when drinking at home people tend not to make the milky cappuccinos and lattes that they would buy when out. Dairy farmers are seeing prices so low that some have been throwing fresh milk down the drain without a buyer to collect it from the farm.\nSupermarkets imposed buying limits to stop people stocking up on some items, including milk and eggs. But Batters said there was no reason for limiting the amount of dairy produce people can purchase as there was no shortage of supply.\nSmall farmers were most at risk from the crisis, Batters warned, as they had less to fall back on and were finding it hard to gain credit extensions from their banks.\nFarmers who diversified, as they were urged to, into side businesses such as running B&Bs are also finding those sources drying up. \u201cNormally we would make \u00a37,000 off tourism per year, but that income is going to vanish,\u201d said Polly Davies, a tenant farmer in Glamorgan.\nBatters will urge ministers at a virtual meeting on Friday to give British farmers a boost by mandating all food bought by public bodies, including the NHS and the army, to come from British producers.\n\u201cThe government has a key role to play, that needs to be recognised,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there is to be a positive legacy from this crisis, let\u2019s build a more resilient economic future \u2013 paying attention to our food and our health, and buying local food, is a key part of that.\u201d",

Here\u2019s how some of you have reacted\nIt is reasonable to maintain a lockdown however, this mismanagement is illustrative of the kind of poor judgment and lack of commitment to the UK from those around Johnson\u2019s government. We can\u2019t move forward because it is chaos. bang2rights\nI don\u2019t understand how the government can say that planning how the lockdown is eased would be \u2018confusing\u2019, yet for the lockdown they announced an initial three weeks and then sort of fudged extending it. So we\u2019ve had a fourth week all on its own and now it\u2019s officially extended for three more weeks. Why were they incapable of announcing a three week extension before the end of the first three weeks? Clarity of messaging is vital. 17Luftballons\nIf the government announce an extension of the lockdown until 10/11 May, then that would be a sensible decision. But if they do so, they also need to plan for a managed transition out of lockdown, it cannot be all or nothing. We desperately need to stop large social gatherings happening immediately after the end of the lockdown or we risk another spike and having to immediately re-introduce measures. gbrading\nSo three weeks brings us to 7 May. Friday 8 May is a bank holiday intended to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE day. There\u2019s no way the lockdown will end May 7. It\u2019ll be extended again. rockyrex\nAnother three weeks at least, and already \u2018adults are showing signs of stress and anxiety\u2019, according to another article here today and, from an article last week, primary-age children are \u2018fearful of leaving the house\u2019, acting for all the world like people with full-blown agoraphobia. We\u2019re sowing mines as we go, and nobody knows the pattern. musicforpleasure\nOn a more serious note \u2013 I am losing confidence that this government will ever let us get back to a normal situation any time soon. They just don\u2019t trust us to understand any potential plan and not break the current lockdown. It may be OK now - but what about in 1 or 2 months time? MyRedShed\nNo plan, no clue, no hope. As usual. WillyThePeople\nCould someone tell Raab, we\u2019re not asking for a timeframe, we are asking, \u2018Do you have a exit plan?\u2019. If not, just say so, but if we don\u2019t then when other countries start to come out of this with a plan, we are going to look incredibly stupid as we will not only be the last country to come out of all this, we will come out of it like a bunch of clueless idiots. MrKirk1974\nAnother three weeks! That is getting very close to Johnson being able to make a big announcement on the 75th anniversary of VE day. DeMinimisLex\nI\u2019m not at all convinced that the benefits of the lockdown are outweighing the drawbacks. The statistics on deaths being caused indirectly, not to mention the immeasurable impacts of peoples mental health are unknown but likely to be huge. The long-term economic impacts will worsen with every day this goes on. We need a staged exit ASAP but the government doesn\u2019t seem to have any sort of plan. jazzual\nThere is evidence of excess deaths, resulting from people being unwilling to use the NHS because of fear of coronavirus. But easing the lockdown is not going to solve that problem. It would just mean that the epidemic would get out of control, and people would have even more reason to avoid using the NHS. The only way to reduce these excess deaths, is to contain the virus. SporadicWit\nRaab says we can\u2019t ease the lockdown until PPE and testing are in place. So never then? Bowring72",

He has lived in Paris for several months, where his talent has blossomed to world elite levels.\nHis speciality is one-minute bullet chess, at which he beat Carlsen on 2 April in an informal first to 100 wins match. At very fast speeds manual dexterity is important, and some blamed Carlsen\u2019s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja was quicker using finger touch.\nWednesday\u2019s final was at Banter Blitz, where players comment verbally on their moves during the game. The time limit was three minutes per player per game, without the one-second or two-second per move increment which is normal for three-minute blitz. Again Firouzja was noticeably faster. He won two games on time and in another Carlsen escaped by checkmating with just 0.2 seconds to spare. While Carlsen kept up an articulate running commentary throughout, Firouzja, whose English is weaker, made fewer early comments and was usually ahead on time after the opening.\nCarlsen was the heavy favourite following his impressive 9-0 semi-final win over the strong Russian Sanan Sjugirov, whereas Firouzja had struggled to defeat the Indian Srinath Narayanan 9-6. But in the final Firouzja was sharper, continually producing tactical tricks which rarely gave his opponent the classically controlled games where he dominates. If there is a historic parallel to this match, it would be the world title matches of 60-70 years ago where David Bronstein and Mikhail Tal also used their combinative ability to disrupt Mikhail Botvinnik\u2019s strategic rhythm.\nThis weekend sees the start of the $250,000 Magnus Carlsen Invitational, the richest ever online tournament and planned as a showpiece for the world champion\u2019s skills. After the events of 2 April and this Wednesday, however, the Invitational has suddenly become a battlefield for survival for its originator.\nOne can excuse Carlsen\u2019s defeats at bullet and blitz as significantly an effect of the playing conditions and time limit which favoured Firouzja, but the Invitational has rapid time controls, 15 minutes per player per game plus a 10 seconds per move increment.\nBack in December Firouzja had Carlsen close to defeat at the World Blitz and won the silver medal behind Carlsen in the World Rapid, but next month at Wijk aan Zee at slower time limits the established elite defeated the teen. Four months further on, and Firouzja is clearly improving as fast as Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov did in their teenage years. So the stakes will be high at the Invitational and especially next Monday. Another success for Firouzja and much of the chess world will view him as the heir apparent to Carlsen\u2019s throne.\nFirst round pairings starting at 3pm this Saturday, are Carlsen (Norway) v Hikaru Nakamura (US) and Firouzja v Ding Liren (China), followed on Sunday by Fabiano Caruana (US) v Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) v Anish Giri (Netherlands). Monday at 3pm is a time to remember as Carlsen and Firouzja meet over four rapid games.\n3667: 1...Nf3+! draws. If 2 exf3 Qxf1+! 3 Kxf1 stalemate draw. The game ended 2 Kg2 Qxe2+! 3 Bxe2 stalemate draw. If 2 Kf2 Qe1+ 3 Kxf3?? (3 Kg2) loses to Qxf1 mate. Instead 1...Nh3+? loses to 2 Kh2! Qxf1 3 Qh7+ Kg4 4 Qh4 mate.

The purpose, it was understood, was for Campion to have a pregnancy test.\nTurnbull was shocked, and soon so was the entire Australian political commentary complex as the deputy prime minister\u2019s private life became the talk of the nation.\nIt all led to the unprecedented \u201cbonk ban\u201d edict from Turnbull to his ministers.\nThere is another important factor involved in that episode and it goes to a sub-theme of Turnbull\u2019s book \u2013 the question of trust.\nSome of his past associates will not appreciate their appearances in this book, and there will be claims of confidences betrayed. But Turnbull clearly believes he dispenses trust too readily and that some of his political acquaintances and co-workers didn\u2019t deserve it.\n\u201cThat said, over the years I\u2019ve been accused by colleagues of being too trusting on matters of this kind,\u201d he writes.\nHe initially accepted Joyce\u2019s assurance he was supporting Campion because she had no family to help her through a difficult time. \u201cHe gave me an unequivocal assurance he wasn\u2019t in a sexual relationship with Vikki,\u201d Turnbull writes.\nHe argues that he does not criticise Joyce on moral grounds, although he branded him \u201ca champion of traditional marriage while practising traditional adultery\u201d.\nHe was angry because towards the end of that year his government was recovering in opinion polls but \u201cthe Barnaby Joyce scandal derailed all that\u201d.\nSo in February he changed the ministerial code of conduct to bar ministers from having sex with staff, a move which, interestingly, only Scott Morrison and Christopher Pyne strongly backed in cabinet.\nThere was a broader question of his personal responsibilities once the Joyce-Campion relationship was obvious: \u201cHow could I confirm the deputy prime minister of Australia had lied to the prime minister?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time the possibility of unsavoury sexual activity landed on prime minister Turnbull\u2019s desk \u2013 figuratively of course. And again the question of trust was involved.\nOn 15 September 2017, the then Australian federal police commissioner, Andrew Colvin, asked for a private meeting to impart what Turnbull calls \u201cuniquely awkward\u201d news.\nPolice were concerned that the Nationals MP George Christensen since 2014 had spent up to 100 days a year overseas, mainly visiting the Philippines. He was staying at \u201cseedy hotels\u201d in Angeles City, the red-light areas of Manila, where he went to bars. Philippine and Australian police were concerned he might be breaking laws or become a target for blackmail.\nAn investigation found that the MP \u2013 described by Turnbull as \u201ca young man, grossly obese and single at the time\u201d \u2013 had not done anything illegal. The conclusion didn\u2019t come until June 2018.\nThis time Turnbull takes a stark moral stance. He says \u201cit beggars belief\u201d an MP could spend nearly a third of the year overseas, on full pay, with the Nationals either not knowing or not caring.\nOf Christensen\u2019s trips, he says: \u201cThe hypocrisy made me sick.\u201d\nHe also notes that the north Queensland MP was a conservative with a statue of the Virgin Mary in this office and a tattoo of her on his shoulder.\nChristensen has always maintained that he was visiting his fiancee in the Philippines and all other allegations are a \u201csmear campaign\u201d from Labor and a \u201cformer very senior Liberal MP\u201d.\nThere were other suggestions of a blending of sex and politics during Turnbull\u2019s Canberra career, according to his book. And again the matter of trust.\nIt should be remembered when reading of this period that Turnbull and Tony Abbott have a history of hostility; they ousted each other from the Liberal leadership.\nThat\u2019s one reason Turnbull takes a close look at the partnership of Abbott as prime minister with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin, in which he sees Credlin as the boss. \u201cIn all my life I\u2019ve never known a leader more dominated by another than Abbott was by Credlin,\u201d Turnbull writes.\nThis was \u201cat odds with Abbott\u2019s carefully cultivated image as the hairy-chested, bike-riding, firefighting alpha male, complete with a swagger that would put a sailor to shame\u201d.\n\u201cHe worshiped and feared her,\u201d Turnbull writes.\nThere has never been any evidence the pair were more than friends and political associates, no matter the gossip.\nTurnbull puts it this way: \u201cPeta has always strongly denied that she and Tony were lovers. But if they were, that would have been the most unremarkable aspect of their friendship.\u201d\nHe writes that big decisions were made without cabinet agreement and damaging allegations about him were leaked to reporters by, he suggests, the prime minister\u2019s office.\n\u201cNeither Abbott nor Credlin were prepared to work with a conventional cabinet system where matters were discussed candidly in private, decisions were taken collectively and then announced,\u201d he writes.\nOne politician Turnbull did get on with, without admiring him, was the US president, Donald Trump. He has known a few billionaires in his time \u201cand then one thing I have learned with bullies is that sucking up to them is precisely the wrong way to go\u201d.\nAt 9am on a Sunday morning in Sydney, Turnbull sat down to have a telephone chat with Trump to preserve an existing agreement for the US to take some refugees from Manus Island.\nTrump sounded tired but was friendly until the refugee deal was raised, when he started pleading angrily the agreement would embarrass him. The president kept talking over the prime minister.\nFinally he agreed to it, on the basis of the close alliance with Australia, Turnbull writes.\nHe and Australian officials kept the transcript of the call secret, even when a White House leak claimed Trump had \u201cblasted\u201d Turnbull.\nLater it was leaked in the US. Can\u2019t trust some people.\nJoyce declined to directly comment on the book\u2019s references to him but he told Guardian Australia: \u201cI accept my moral failings against Malcolm\u2019s obviously unblemished record.\u201d\nGeorge Christensen has been contacted for comment.",

In the historical sense, however, little will have changed. The government\u2019s response to the pandemic has featured suppression of individual liberty, suppression of commercial freedom, a substantial extension of state economic intervention, and an expansion of state expenditure on a scale previously associated with major wars.\nTo those conditioned to regard Margaret Thatcher as the embodiment of Conservative philosophy, this is undoubtedly striking. However, Thatcher was an exception. Her philosophy owed more to 19th-century liberalism than to conservatism. The Conservative party\u2019s heritage includes supporting powerful monarchical government, suppressing free trade, and supporting the heavily statist political consensus of the 1945-1979 era. It was far more comfortable with wartime government than the old Liberal party.\nMore recently, David Cameron was rather more comfortable wearing the mantles of Harold Macmillan and Tony Blair than that of Thatcher, and Boris Johnson appears to be happiest when dabbling in environmentalism, NHS worship and fiscal incontinence. The political landscape might well change after this year, but the Conservative party need not.Deri HughesLondon\n As Martin Kettle notes, it may well be that the Covid-19 virus will change the course of the Tory party. But it won\u2019t change its character. What is evident to many is that at this time of terrible crisis, we are subject to an administration that is made up of many individuals whose records show them to be liars and manipulators, with some closely connected to the financial elite that are using this situation to make profits for themselves. No one can trust this administration. The one certainty is that their exit strategy will be characterised by deceit, fabrications, and false accounting \u2013 oh, and hypocrisy.Adrin NeatrourNewcastle upon Tyne\n Martin Kettle\u2019s expectation of a significant shift in this government\u2019s values post-crisis is confronted by the fact of the Tory/Lib Dem assault on the state after the 2008 crash. Then, the ballooning public sector deficit was used as a fig leaf by neoliberal ideologues for deep and sustained cuts in public expenditure. Why would the same arguments not be rolled out again, by an administration enjoying a large majority over a currently punch-drunk opposition? While there may be some dancing around the NHS, is there any realistic prospect of recovery for other areas excoriated since 2010?Pete FenwickChelmsford, Essex\n It is deeply ironic that the party and its small-government, Britain-alone philosophy, which gained a huge stamp of electoral approval only four months ago, is now having to handle a crisis that demands big government and international cooperation. Martin Kettle is right that this provides a real dilemma for Johnson. A reversion to the Cummings script and a failure to recalibrate the economy in a way that recognises who the true key workers are would surely spell electoral disaster. But the opposite course of action would take the PM and his party in a direction that is totally counter to their beliefs and instincts. Parking his tanks on Labour\u2019s lawn would be a huge political risk.Robin PickeringExeter\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

As recently as 2013 the company was the most valuable in the world, but is now worth about 13% as much as tech titans Apple and Microsoft.\nNetflix, which has more than 160 million subscribers globally, was boosted by the success of original content released after lockdown measures were imposed around the world, such as the seven-part documentary series Tiger King, which tells the story of Joe Exotic, an eccentric breeder of big cats.\nThe service\u2019s rivals, such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, with an estimated 118 million users, and Disney\u2019s new streaming service, also benefited from new users. Disney+ only launched in the UK and other western European markets in February, and has already doubled its global subscriber base to 50 million.\nSuch has been the demand for streaming services that Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and the BBC\u2019s iPlayer agreed at the start of the lockdown to reduce the speed of their streams across Europe to ensure broadband networks could cope with significantly higher usage.\nNetflix is among Wall Street\u2019s so-called Faang stocks, the most popular and best-performing US technology companies. The acronym also includes Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google.\nAmazon and Netflix investors have shrugged off concerns about the effect of the pandemic on Netflix\u2019s scripted TV and film production in the US, which have been paused.\nMeanwhile, ExxonMobil and other oil giants, including the UK firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have seen their share prices tumble as demand slumped to the lowest level in 25 years.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warned the biggest oil production cuts in history would not be enough to offset the huge fall in demand, to levels not seen since 1995, even if travel restrictions are eased in the second half of the year.\nEarlier this month ExxonMobil announced it would reduce its spending by a third this year, a reduction of $10bn, as it scaled back plans to cope with the fall in global oil prices. The cuts will be concentrated in the US\u2019s Permian Basin, located in Texas and New Mexico.",

They\u2019re already here\nAs the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund loomed closer this week, an uplifting tweet from Faustino Asprilla began doing the rounds. \u201cMike Ashley saw fans of Newcastle like bar codes, hopefully that will end soon this team is for lovers not for just merchandisers,\u201d Asprilla wrote, focusing on the departure of the unloved current ownership.\nEven within the tin-eared nexus of social media there is an element of double-take about the response. To date Asprilla\u2019s tweet has received 8,000 likes and retweets. Scroll down the replies and the attitude towards the prospective change of guard is unreservedly positive. Hand-clap emojis; \u201cClass\u201d; we deserve more; get rid of greed in football (seriously!) \u2013 and not just from long-suffering fans, from paid observers too.\nAt which point it is necessary to take a step back, slap yourself a few hundred times around the head to shake off the cognitive dissonance, and attempt to process how the scales of good and bad seem to work around here. Exit, the House of Karrimor. Enter, the austere and unforgiving House of Saud, a process that is somehow being hailed as a victory for \u201clovers\u201d; and the end (more laughter in the dark) of the cynical commodifying of Newcastle United.\nPerhaps it is time here for a tale of the tape. Mike Ashley: pig-headed retail magnate. Saudi Arabia: blood-stained inherited dictatorship. Mike Ashley: zero hours contracts in his sports shops. Saudi Arabia: beheaded 37 men in a single day. Mike Ashley: showed disrespect to Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Saudi Arabia: murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi. Is this useful at all?\nAshley wants to sell you a cheap nylon tracksuit. Saudi Arabia wants to sell you a soft-focus view of its oppressive regime, safe in the knowledge that a mega-spending spree will provide instant distraction, thereby treating the fanbase of a great British football club as useful idiots in the soft\u2011power game. \u201cWe\u2019re getting our club back,\u201d has been a refrain in the last few days. Really? Because it looks more like something more precious is being taken away.\nIn the meantime, yes, the Saudis are finally here. This kind of deal can always hit a late snag. But given the chairman of the Saudi Private Investment Fund, Mohammed bin Salman, owns a painting that cost more than Newcastle, it seems likely any hitches can be smoothed over. At the end of which the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will own an 80% stake in the club.\nYou might wonder why a \u00a3300bn fund would want a football\u2011friendly businesswoman and two local property developers to own the other 20%. Well, maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re a football-friendly businesswoman and two local property developers. It certainly breaks up the row of grinning beards. And let\u2019s be clear: image, spin and reputation management is the game here.\nFor now it also means this conversation must happen again, the one where a liberal-left newspaper suggests that this is not a desirable entity to own a community-centred football club. In return a small, vocal swathe of that club\u2019s online support will click into gear, warrior cells in the sportswashing immune system, and suggest that to point this out is unfair, biased and typically loaded against [insert name of club here].\nTo date the most common responses have included: you never mentioned Club X or indeed Club Y, who are also owned by sportswashing regimes. Another popular theme is that journalists stick up for Mike Ashley because he\u2019s \u201cfrom London\u201d (Ashley is from Buckinghamshire. Mohammed bin Salman, on the other hand, is much more of a Londoner: he does at least own a fair bit of it).\nThis time, however, it does feel as though something has changed. Perhaps we are at a tipping point in this process. Because the whataboutery does actually have some substance. Newcastle may be the headline act, but they\u2019re not even half the story.\nIf we really are to make a stand on this, to suggest that a regime where homosexuality is punishable by flogging (awkward Rainbow Laces day ahead) isn\u2019t a desirable guest at the top table of British sport, then that process is going to require a hasty rewind. The fact is, the Saudis aren\u2019t coming. They\u2019re already here, carried through the financial arms of the PIF like some irresistible super\u2011virus particle.\nThe Premier League is already a willing host. Manchester United have a tie-in with the Saudi General Sports Authority, adjunct to their longstanding deal with the Saudi telecoms agency. West Ham are 10% owned by Blackstone Finance, part-funded by the Saudis. Saudi Arabia owns a stake in Uber, who have previously teamed up with Chelsea. By the same conduit the Saudis in effect sponsor 5% of Mo Salah.\nIt is a process to which the wider world of sport has already given in. We are all Saudis now, touched in some form by the success of the 2016 national transformation project, designed to diminish Saudi dependence on oil and create a pop-up global leisure economy.\nThe WWE and world boxing are on board. Even dear old moral high hats Barcelona have a commercial link with Samba, a Saudi finance company.\nIt\u2019s no secret why this is happening. Throwing money into sport is a shortcut to cultural legitimacy, and certainly much easier than keeping Amnesty International happy. The question is what, if anything, those who still have the will to see sporting clubs as a special case, a protected industry, are willing to do about it.\nThere are some changes that could help. A rule against sovereign wealth funds owning majority stakes in football clubs would be a start. Some kind of genuine fit and proper test is conceivable, one that involves a clearly defined notion of moral probity.\nAnd yet, you can already feel this collapsing. In a world where nobody is clean, where every hedge fund is connected to something grey, where even professional journalists struggle to see the difference between the harm done by leveraged buyouts and the moral vacuity of nation-state reputation washing, it is easy to fall into moral relativism, to lose any confidence in the ability to say this is not a desirable outcome.\nAt the end of which Mohammed bin Salman is coming up the path in a black and white striped shirt. And the unregulated, entirely commercial Premier League has taken another decisive step down a path from which it will struggle to return.",

        "content": "Too much emphasis placed on brand names to help during coronavirus crisis, say industry sources\nThe government has been too slow to enlist British textile firms to make protective gear for the NHS, according to industry figures, who say they have been desperate to contribute to the \u201cwar effort\u201d.\nFaced with a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the Cabinet Office has only recently begun scrambling to source it from UK suppliers and has now outsourced the process to consultants from accountancy group Deloitte.\nIndustry figures said too much emphasis had been placed on high-profile names such as Burberry, the luxury fashion house that Matt Hancock said on 3 April was producing medical gowns.\nKate Hills, the founder of Make It British, which promotes brands that manufacture in the UK, said the government was ignoring less well-known textile specialists in favour of household names that play well with the public. \u201cThey\u2019re just picking out brand names,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe people who can make this PPE are not well-known names, they are contract manufacturers behind the scenes. They\u2019ve filled in the government\u2019s request forms and heard nothing back.\u201d\nA separate source with knowledge of the fashion industry\u2019s efforts said: \u201cYou can\u2019t put all your eggs in that one Burberry basket.\u201d\nHills said UK firms had been clamouring to help supply the NHS for more than a month, but that the government had instead focused on brands such as Burberry, as well as sourcing equipment from overseas.\n\u201cThe number one priority was to secure anything already made that they could get on a plane from other countries. We don\u2019t have the capacity and the products ready off the shelf because for years the NHS have been procuring products from cheap overseas suppliers.\n\u201cWe have to put the supply chain back together from scratch. It\u2019s almost as if there had to be a desperate need before they looked on their own doorstep.\u201d\nOne major clothing supplier, who asked not to be named, said their firm had also struggled to get interest from the government. \u201cThe level that we\u2019re scaling up is embarrassing. If the borders shut and we couldn\u2019t bring in masks from China, we\u2019d be screwed.\u201d\nThe source said the process of getting protective clothing out to the NHS was mired in confusion from the government about the regulatory and testing regime for PPE.\nOfficials have been exploring ways to waive the usual regulatory requirements \u2013 as has happened with medical ventilators \u2013 but the process has been slow to get off the ground.\nOne difficulty with sourcing medical gowns is that they are typically made from fabric known as SMMS that combines two types of non-woven material, called meltblown and spunbond.\nAmid a global shortage, the Scottish fabric specialist Don & Low received an order last week from the government for a spunbond laminate that would meet the same international standard.\nDon & Low, which is based in Forfar, will eventually be able to make enough material for up to 1.5m gowns a month, but cannot reach full-scale production until May. The company is supplying the material to Burberry, among other companies, but has sent only trial fabrics to the fashion house so far.\nWill Campbell, Don & Low\u2019s sales manager, said: \u201cYou\u2019re setting up a supply chain from the ground up. If you were doing this without a pandemic, you\u2019d do it over a year or more. The fact that it\u2019s been done in three weeks is fairly admirable.\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t get away from the fact that hospitals are running out of PPE.\u201d\nOne of the few UK fashion houses that has already produced PPE is Barbour, which has delivered disposable gowns and medical scrubs from its South Shields factory to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne.\nSmaller suppliers have also been delivering their own homespun protective equipment to hospitals on a more ad hoc basis. They include the designer Patrick Grant, founder of the Community Clothing initiative, alongside projects called the Emergency Designer Network and ScrubHub.\nThe carmaker Nissan said on on Thursday that its Sunderland car plant, the UK\u2019s largest, will deliver 100,000 face visors per week to the NHS.\nThe government-owned Royal Mint, in Llantrisant, south Wales, has been making medical visors for the NHS after developing a successful prototype to help protect frontline care workers.\nA host of firms, including chemicals giant Ineos, beer firm Brewdog and several gin distilleries, have been producing hand sanitiser.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in discussions with a range of British firms on providing PPE for the NHS as well as sourcing it from abroad.\n\u201cThe Cabinet Office has a dedicated team to help fast-track the regulatory approval process and has published the specifications for a wide range of items to support manufacturers to produce PPE, helping ensure equipment can reach health and social care workers as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThe Guardian has approached Burberry for comment.\n Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

        "content": "The throbbing vein was gone as a chilled Dominic Raab fronted the latest No 10 press briefing \nOn Thursday we saw a rather different Dominic Raab. For every other appearance fronting up the daily Downing Street press briefing, we\u2019ve had the Colonel Kurtz foreign secretary. The full-on madman with vein throbbing in his forehead. Ready to mix it with his own shadow and now so far gone he was almost longing for the police to arrest him.\nNow, though, Dom was a great deal more chilled. Even to the point of being totally boring. He could make a more than acceptable de facto prime minister yet. It\u2019s amazing what a 7% solution of beta blockers and Mogadon can achieve. From tense and nervous and I-can\u2019t-relax psycho killer to suburban Rotarian in one very slow heartbeat. No need for anyone to run, run, run, run, run, run, run away. This was Raab as the chartered surveyor who had received a series of unexpected promotions simply by turning down every project as being too risky. That way, he would never get to be proved wrong. Dom: the Man who likes to say \u201cNo\u201d.\nThere again, Raab had managed to slow down both his metabolism and his thought processes so much that he was now actually at least seven days behind the rest of the country. On the plus side, he\u2019s still got a sunny Easter weekend to look forward to. It\u2019s been evident to anyone with the hint of a pulse for over a week now that there was no chance of the government lifting any of its lockdown measures anytime soon. You\u2019ve only had to see the daily fatality figures to know that. But Dom still managed to make the announcement as if it was breaking news. Perhaps it was to him.\nMind you, Raab did hedge his bets a bit by saying that the restrictions would initially remain in place for another three weeks. It sounded as if he was hoping the prime minister might be back in action by then, so that it would be Boris Johnson and not him who would have to break it to a stir-crazy nation that the three weeks might then turn into another three weeks. And then another three weeks after that.\nClearly the government believes the country can only take three weeks of bad news at any one time. Shame Boris rather gave the game away last month by saying the quarantine could last three months. No one should be making too many plans for before the end of June at the earliest.\nThe foreign secretary had also cannily taken a leaf out of Matt Hancock\u2019s book. Two weeks ago the secretary for health and social care \u2013 that\u2019s the bit he tends to forget about and gets tacked on as an afterthought \u2013 had grandly announced his \u201cFive Pillars\u201d for the NHS that sounded authoritative and had gone down well with the public. Even though no one \u2013 not even Tigger \u2013 could any longer remember what any of those five pillars had been.\nSo Dom decided to go big, think outside of the box even, by coming up with his Five Tests that would determine the basis on which the government would consider easing restrictions. Information that had hitherto been considered so top secret that neither Rishi Sunak nor Hancock had been able to share it with the nation when asked at press conferences earlier in the week. So here was Raab, playing it straight and looking the country directly in the eyes. Even if his own were half closed due to the near lethal cocktail of drugs he had injected half an hour earlier.\nFirst, things would have to get a bit better in some areas. Second, things would have to get a bit better in other areas. Tests three, four and five followed along similar lines. The Five Tests were literally what anyone could have worked out for themselves. At another time, it might have been a worry that it had taken the cabinet so long to state the obvious. But nowadays we have become accustomed to have \u201cbeing dim\u201d and \u201cslow react\u201d priced in to every government decisions.\nThe briefing had always been meant to be dull and matter-of-fact, to lure everyone into a state of narcolepsy. But realising it had been rather flatter and more depressing than intended and that there were still no answers as to why Germany and South Korea appeared to be handling the crisis so much better, Raab belatedly tried to find a few positives. The health secretary had finally remembered care homes existed and was going to get each and every one of them to pay for a shiny, superhero Green Badge that could instantly repel the coronavirus.\nTowards the end, Raab became slightly punchier as the drugs wore off. Though he couldn\u2019t bring himself to wholly defend the World Health Organization \u2013 he might get ticked off by Donald Trump or Boris if he did \u2013 he did say that the UK might have to rethink its relationship with China once the crisis was over.\nThis on the same day the prime minister\u2019s press spokesman had said the UK would be better off dealing with the pandemic without being held back by EU regulations. Hell, if he felt like that why not go the whole hog and scrub the facade of the trade negotiations and end transition now. Fantastic. The UK\u2019s answer to a global catastrophe was to go it alone. Who needed some vaccine made by foreigners? This was Britannia Unchained. Now where had Dom heard that phrase before?",

Germany, in comparison, has organised 101 such flights through the programme, repatriating a total of 21,815 of its citizens with EU cash.\nAbout 65,000 UK nationals around the world are still in need of repatriation compared to \u201cseveral thousand\u201d German nationals, according to figures obtained by the Guardian.\nA Foreign Office spokesman did not deny the accuracy of the data, which was shared by the UK with foreign consulates earlier this week.\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the numbers raised questions over the British government\u2019s repatriation policy. \u201cThe UK\u2019s reliance on commercial airlines has left far too many British citizens stranded abroad, with many concerned about running out of money or medication and increasingly anxious about how they will get home.\u201d\nShe said she had been \u201coverwhelmed with appeals for help from Britons\u201d, some of whom had lost thousands of pounds on cancelled flights. Their plight underlined the need, she said, for an interim foreign secretary to be appointed to enable urgent decisions to be taken about the charter flights.\n \u201cFCO staff are doing their best but there are decisions to be taken, in real time, to support those British citizens who feel they have been abandoned at a time of great need,\u201d she said.\nOn Thursday the German embassy confirmed it had repatriated 60,000 citizens \u2013 up from 42,000 two weeks ago \u2013 on 240 charter flights, compared to \u201cmore than 2,800\u201d British citizens cited by the UK foreign minister James Cleverly on a recent Twitter update.\nImportant information for British nationals who are currently abroad \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/HtGdm701Hr\nAdrienne Newton, a retried GP, who has been stranded in Argentina for a month, said she has lost faith in the British government after the embassy rang her and said there were 300 people stranded but no plans for charter flights.\nShe said: \u201cThe British government in Argentina is only notable by its absence and it has left us reeling. I don\u2019t feel safe in the government\u2019s hands any more. Last week there were flights organised by France to Paris and Amsterdam, by Spain to Madrid. Iberia has another flight to Madrid tomorrow while Germany has another flight to Frankfurt and Switzerland has one to Zurich on Saturday. And what is our government doing? Nothing, it is embarrassing.\u201d\nShe had now resorted, she said, to begging other embassies for a seat on their flights; they had all responded \u201cpersonally\u201d with emails to say their flights were full.\nThe government has been severely criticised by MPs and constituents for the failure to act like other EU countries towards its own citizens in the face of a pandemic.\nIt was only on 30 March that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, two weeks after many countries had locked down, announced a \u00a375m effort to repatriate hundreds of thousands of British.\nUnder the EU\u2019s civil protection mechanism established in 2001 participating countries can recuperate, from the EU budget, 75% of the costs of organising emergency flights during times of natural disaster.\nThe six flights organised by the UK under the scheme took place in February and March carrying 1,125 Britons. Four of the flights were from Lima, Peru, and one each was chartered to transport people from the cities of Oakland in California, and Tokyo.\nThe flights also took home 122 EU nationals from Ireland, Germany, Romania, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, France, Latvia, Lithuania and Belgium.\nA further 672 UK nationals have been returned home on flights organised by other countries.\nRaab has also agreed to a weekly meeting with the foreign minister Nigel Adams, other MPs and Nandy, who have complained about the lack of rescue flights. Sources said the first meeting was \u201cvery useful\u201d.\nParticipants in this civil protection mechanism are the 27 EU member states, the UK and six \u201cparticipating states\u201d, namely Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey.\nExplaining the relatively low number of flights organised by the UK, sources said it was a condition of the mechanism that seats should be made available on flights to EU nationals but that this was not always possible given the number of Britons in need of rescue. The mechanism is also supposed to be used as a last resort.\nThese conditions have not stopped Germany flying its nationals back from all around the world, including from Bali, Brisbane, Sydney, Islamabad, Mumbai and Mexico City.\nGermany, which had an estimated 250,000 nationals affected by the travel lockdowns, of which about 50,000 were stranded, is by far the biggest user of the EU mechanism, ahead of France (18 flights), the Czech Republic (13), Spain (11) and Belgium (8). A total of 43,584 stranded people have been repatriated with EU funds.\nThe UK has faced an uphill battle getting its citizens back but about 1.3 million Britons have returned home since the outbreak began.\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has activated the civil protection mechanism on several occasions, as part of our international response to coronavirus, which helped repatriate British nationals and EU citizens.\u201d\n The headline of this article was amended on 22 April 2020 to more accurately reflect that the flights which were the main subject of this article were EU-funded.",

It will land near Vallis Schr\u00f6teri, a collapsed lava tunnel in the Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms) region of the moon. This is a site that was initially considered by Nasa in the late 1960s/early 70s for its subsequently cancelled Apollo 18 mission.\nThe Nova-C will deliver commercial cargo and five Nasa-provided payloads to the lunar surface. It can carry 100kg of payload and generate 200 watts of power. It will also test a precision landing and hazard avoidance (PLHA) landing system, created by Intuitive Machines, that aims to be able to land within 200 metres of a designated spot.\nTogether with two other companies, Astrobotic and Orbit Beyond Inc, Intuitive Machines shared a $250m contract in May 2019 to deliver Nasa payloads to the moon as part of Nasa\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme.

        "content": "Formula One teams have failed to reach an agreement to adopt a substantial cut to the budget cap set to be imposed in 2021. Talks on Thursday between team principals, the FIA and F1 were understood to be constructive and they will come together again next week to readdress the issue. The original spending cap of $175m (\u00a3140m) has already been agreed to be reduced to $150m but the proposal being considered is to drop it further to $130m.\nThe meetings are considered a vital step towards ensuring the sport emerges intact from the coronavirus outbreak. The four-hour virtual meeting was the second in seven days to discuss the proposed changes as the sport attempts to come to terms with the financial implications of the virus. The president of the FIA, Jean Todt, described it on Twitter as an \u201cImportant meeting by video conference today with Chase Carey, @F1 & @FIA teams to build together a New Deal for the future of our sport\u201d.\nThe discussion centred on setting a ceiling of $145m for 2021 and then $130m in 2022. The latter was the target figure F1 had proposed to the teams under their plans for the future of the sport set out in 2018.\nNine races have been called off this season, potentially placing F1 and its teams under enormous financial strain, with reports on Thursday suggesting Silverstone could host multiple races when it finally starts and Austria could be the venue for the opener. Race hosting fees are one of the three major sources of income for the sport and they are highly likely to take a major hit. Should more races be cancelled or postponed, broadcasting fees and sponsorship income are also likely to suffer.\nThe concept of a sliding scale for the volume of aerodynamic research based on a team\u2019s position in the constructors\u2019 championship, weighted in favour of reverse order of success, was also discussed. The idea is understood to have been viewed favourably by F1.\nThe McLaren team principal, Andreas Seidl, has been emphatic in warning that F1 could lose smaller teams if it failed to address the spending issue and his team had been pushing for a cap of $100m.\nF1\u2019s sporting director, Ross Brawn, had said that coronavirus has forced F1 to look hard at it spending and that it had to act. \u201cI think when we introduced the budget control there was always the anticipation that if we had a crisis we could turn the dial down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dial has been set at 11 for too long. We need to wind it down. We said this [sort of crisis] was what the budget cap was for when it was introduced. We\u2019re there sooner than anyone hoped or wanted, but we are there now and it would be irresponsible to ignore it. We\u2019ve all got to respond.\u201d\nThe big three teams, Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull, are estimated to spend in excess of $400m a year, with the remaining teams having costs of between $150m and $250m. There are serious staffing implications with such a drastic cut for the top three teams, who employ between 800 and 1,000 staff.\nThere had already been an informal agreement to drop the cap to $150m but it is understood both Red Bull and Ferrari were resistant to it falling any further. Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Mattia Binotto, had pointed out that a flat rate ceiling did not necessarily work across the board. \u201cWhen discussing a budget cap, we should not forget that we\u2019ve got different situations, and it\u2019s important that we find common ground somehow which is suited to the different situations,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThere is still analysis required to make the right decisions. I think we should avoid being really emotional at the moment.\u201d\nFerrari had pointed out that smaller teams buy parts form the larger ones and that they do not have to spend on research and development on these parts. Equally some teams such as Racing Point and Haas buy major elements of their cars from other teams, while Williams and McLaren remain independent manufacturers purchasing only engines.",

Any cuts that were conceded would need to be made in a way that protected lower-paid workers and had \u201ca greater effect on higher salary earners\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny salary concessions should be accompanied by relatively larger cuts in VC/senior executive salary packages,\u201d the union resolved.\nBut the decision has prompted furious backlash from within the union\u2019s membership.\nMore than 500 members, many of them senior academics from universities across Australia, have now signed a petition rejecting the NTEU\u2019s position and attacking its leadership for not consulting with them before passing the resolution.\n\u201cWe reject concessions to our wages and conditions,\u201d the petition reads.\n\u201cThere is no guarantee that sacrificing hard won conditions will save a single job [and] many of us live in households with people who have already lost jobs or hours, and can\u2019t afford more sacrifice. [If] workers in some of the richest institutions in Australia decide to give up conditions, it sets a terrible precedent for workers everywhere.\u201d\nA meeting of about 150 member activists on Thursday, convened by the union\u2019s RMIT branch, censured the union for proposing that \u201cour members sacrifice pay and conditions to cover losses\u201d, while calling on the government to provide added assistance by covering all lost student revenue.\nThe activists unanimously resolved to campaign against any loss of pay or conditions, and urged the union to convene state and federal meetings for members.\n\u201cWe commit to escalating actions to defend our pay, conditions and jobs \u2013 up to and including industrial action,\u201d the members said.\nThe NTEU\u2019s general secretary, Matthew McGowan, said the union had been forced to move quickly to try to protect jobs in a rapidly evolving crisis.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve seen \u2026 workers are actually finding themselves out of work almost overnight, and our fear is that this is going to happen in universities very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve moved very quickly to try and address that problem, and to try and do what we can to protect people\u2019s jobs and their income.\u201d\nMcGowan said he welcomed the debate on the union\u2019s position and would ensure that members were consulted widely. No agreement would be finalised without member endorsement, he said.\nThe union had communicated its plans with members in an email on 8 April, he said, less than a week after the national executive resolutions and initial talks with Universities Australia.\nBut furious members say the email did not disclose the resolution to consider negotiating pay cuts.\nAfter the email from the union\u2019s leadership outlining parts of their position last week, branch members from the University of Sydney passed a motion censuring the leadership and opposing \u201cpunitive cost-save measures\u201d.\nThe motion demanded that the NTEU \u201cnot make substantial offers to the government or employers\u201d without convening a vote of members.\nNick Riemer, an academic at Sydney university, called the NTEU\u2019s position a \u201cvery serious breach of solidarity\u201d.\n\u201cNot only is the NTEU leadership signalling that pay losses are OK; it\u2019s also giving managements a green light to throw casualised staff under the bus,\u201d he said.\nOther branches have since followed. The University of Melbourne passed a motion censuring the NTEU leadership \u201cfor undercutting our industrial and political response by already offering wage and conditions concessions to our employers\u201d.\nMembers at the Victoria University voted to express its deep concern about the position and demanded \u201cthe rescinding of any deal already negotiated\u201d.\nFleur Taylor, a member of the Victoria University branch, said staff felt the union was entertaining concessions on pay and conditions before properly campaigning for federal government support.\nOn Thursday RMIT staff said they would \u201cprepare a vigorous campaign to urge members to vote \u2018no\u2019 to concessions on conditions and pay\u201d and committed to \u201cescalating actions to defend our pay, conditions and jobs \u2013 up to and including industrial action\u201d.",

I conclude that the applicant was not afforded procedural fairness in the conduct of the August 2019 assessment and that a declaration should be made to this effect.\u201d\nThe decision means that the injunction keeping the family in Australia will remain in effect until final orders are made. Moshinsky asked the government and the family\u2019s lawyers to either provide an agreed set of orders in seven days, or in 14 days to provide submissions from each side on proposed orders.\nThe judgment was handed down to the family over a teleconference call. The coronavirus pandemic has forces the federal court to move to remote judgments. Throughout the case, a handful of dedicated protestors supporting the family stood outside court, and also sat through the hearings, but could not be there for the judgment on Friday.\nLabor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, called on the government to act in good faith with the family\u2019s lawyers over the orders to be made.\n\u201cLabor is relieved the family will not be deported from Australia whilst this is taking place \u2013 particularly given the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on all countries and people across the globe,\u201d Keneally said.\n\u201cAs has always been the case, home affairs minister Peter Dutton could bring this whole process to an end by using his discretion under the Migration Act and allow the family to return home to Biloela.\u201d",

Anglicare staff and management have been greatly distressed for our residents and their loved ones at Newmarch House.\u201d\nAn outbreak occurred in the home after a staff member worked for six days without knowing she had the virus, as she had only mild symptoms of a sore throat and running nose. Currently the federal government advice is that health and aged care workers can be tested if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms specifically. This guidance is the same for NSW.\nOn Friday the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said testing would be expanded to any aged care worker with symptoms of illness in the home, even without fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\u201cA strong focus on anyone who works with vulnerable people, aged care worker, health care workers, even with minimal symptoms \u2026 please come forward to testing,\u201d Chant said. All residents and staff of Newmarch House have now been tested, with results pending. Some states, including Victoria and Western Australia, have gone beyond federal guidelines.\nVictoria now says anyone with fever or chills, or acute respiratory infection that is characterised by cough, sore throat or shortness of breath can be tested, and testing is also recommended for people with new onset of other clinical symptoms consistent with Covid-19 if they are close contacts of a confirmed case or have returned from overseas in the past 14 days. Headache, myalgia, runny or stuffy nose, anosmia (losing sense of smell), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea are all considered clinical symptoms.\nA NSW Health spokesman said the state had not diverged from federal guidelines. The health department was prioritising testing in areas where there was a small number of cases of community transmission but the source had not been identified, the spokesman said.\n\u201cThere is no test that can predict whether or not someone will become unwell after exposure to a confirmed case and therefore testing on people with no symptoms can often lead to false negative results,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor this reason, NSW Health only tests people with symptoms of Covid-19 such as fever, sore throat, a dry cough or other respiratory symptoms. People living or working in areas identified as having an elevated risk of community transmission are encouraged to have a test.\u201d\nChant said earlier in the week that the staff member of Newmarch House who first had the virus there was \u201cdistraught\u201d and \u201cmortified\u201d by the situation. On Thursday the NSW Health Services Union supported the health worker after the state health minister Brad Hazzard accused her of \u201cnot doing the right thing\u201d. He made the comments despite the premier Gladys Berejiklian telling reporters: \u201cI feel for her and want to tell her directly she did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\u201cAll of us empathise with her,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cShe did the right thing. As soon as she realised she could have been in contact with someone with the illness, she got tested.\u201d\nAll residents in the home have been isolated in their rooms since Sunday.\nMatthew Fowler\u2019s 87 year old father is in Newmarch House and returned a negative test for Covid-19 earlier in the week. But Fowler said he had been retested on Friday along with all of the other residents.\nFowler said he was not angry at the worker who initially had the virus, but said he wanted infection control procedures at the home reviewed. He has made a complaint to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.\nThere have been 29 new cases of Covid-19 across NSW since Thursday, including the 15 additional cases identified from Newmarch House. A seven-week-old baby boy is among the new infections in the state. The total cases in NSW is 2,926, including 26 patients in intensive care, 19 of whom are ventilated.",

        "content": "The race to resume the 2020 season has put rugby league in an awkward standoff amid wavering levels of government support\nWhat started as a creative solution to a very complex problem has descended into chaos for the NRL, a football code that is no stranger to creating headlines but one which is finding itself under increasing scrutiny.\nThe crisis manual at NRL headquarters, better known as Project Apollo, must make for interesting reading. However, in contrast to its innovative prelude, the subsequent missing chapters have left key players in federal and state politics \u2013 alongside the general population \u2013 divided.\nNSW premier Gladys Berejiklian had been vocally supportive of a return of major sports in her state, providing an effective lift-off for the mission in its early stages. Her deputy, John Barilaro, has continued to back the league\u2019s reactivation plans, but the support has not been shared by the premiers of neighbouring states, nor by some of the country\u2019s chief medical advisors.\nBut on Friday morning, Berejiklian backed away and when asked whether her government had approved league\u2019s return on ABC radio, she responded with a decisive \u201cno\u201d.\nDespite the premier\u2019s reluctance, Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys remains adamant plans for the NRL will move ahead. V\u2019landys is riding on the strength of the \u201cwritten permission\u201d of NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller combined with a promise by the NRL to stay committed to the health and safety of players and the community at large.\nThe NRL now finds itself in an awkward stand-off amid wavering levels of government support and cannot rely on the usual obligation of major broadcasters. The code has been embroiled in a myriad of issues over the past few days; none of them have moved the sport closer to finding a solution.\nLast week\u2019s scathing broadside from Channel Nine \u2013 one of the game\u2019s major broadcast partner \u2013 fuelled speculation the station was not committed to a resuscitation of the 2020 season. In reality for the NRL, it was like one of Apollo\u2019s astronauts being left behind in space without a lifeline.\nV\u2019landys has now been charged with sweetening the apparent oversight of the game\u2019s broadcasters not being invited to the NRL table and striking a deal where a revised competition can be televised viably, in an environment where the appetite of advertisers has drastically waned.\nThe message from V\u2019landys is set: 28 May is a target date. What is not clear, is how the NRL plans to execute the game\u2019s revival in the next six weeks.\nIt is evident that is reliant on the continued deceleration of Covid-19 cases. Opponents cite the bold ambition of V\u2019landys and his innovation committee as arrogant and flying in the face of expert medical advice. How can one justify hundreds of adults breaking social distancing rules each weekend to smother each other in tackles while the rest of the country is told to remain a metre and a half away from everyone, including close friends and family? Who do the NRL think they are?\nThe innovation committee recently unveiled the wild notion of an NRL island or forced self-isolation hub as a way to adhere to health regulations and to guarantee the safety of players and the community. As the level of infection in Australia has subsided, so too has the scope and creativity of the NRL\u2019s solution.\nThe preferred option is to host the competition between ANZ Stadium and Penrith, with Sydney-based teams allowed to live day-to-day within their own homes. With Victoria and Queensland rolling out tighter measures to control the virus, players from the Brisbane Broncos, North Queensland Cowboys and Gold Coast Titans as well as Melbourne Storm would need to relocate to NSW unless the restrictions are lifted in the coming weeks.\nAnd then there is the issue of the New Zealand-based Warriors. Despite a possible return touted as early as this weekend, the Warriors remain in limbo \u2013 uncertain of what international quarantine requirements will be imposed by countries; unsure of where their new home will be; doubtful that they will be granted permission to train when condemned to a 14-day self-isolation period after touching down in Sydney.\nWhile headlines are swirling around hypothetical plots, the NRL needs to urgently chart its plan and firm its course. It needs to rapidly unify its major stakeholders and create equality between the teams. It needs to harvest the support of its sponsors. And it needs to gain the green light of government.\nMeanwhile, its rival, the AFL, is due to announce plans for a restart at the end of April. The somewhat sleeping giant has made no waves at the peak of the crisis and might just surpass the NRL; not through ingenuity or innovation, but simply by taking a path of less resistance in a climate of uncertainty.",

The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported toll. Meanwhile in the last few hours the business world has begun absorbing the news that the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020. The first such contraction on record for China comes after months of paralysis from the coronavirus lockdown.\nBritain\u2019s biggest companies handed out almost half a trillion pounds in dividends and share buybacks in the years before the coronavirus crisis, according to a report calling for tough conditions on any taxpayer-funded bailouts. Burgeoning dividend payouts left companies weak going into the Covid-19 crash, as well as fuelling inequality, says the Common Wealth thinktank. It says the government needs to take an equity stake in firms receiving financial support, while job security guarantees should be made, and ministers could also impose bans on dividends and share buybacks, insist on maximum pay caps for top executives, and get assurances that companies will pay their taxes fairly.\nAfter attempting to lord it over state governors, Donald Trump has unveiled guidelines for reopening the economy that ultimately defer to them on when and how restrictions should be eased within their borders. The first phase allows for work but only essential travel; the second would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel; the third allows for schools and organised youth activities to open up as well as large venues under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d and bars on the basis of reduced occupancy. David Smith writes that the guidelines are supposedly science-based but fail to set out critical elements like a national testing strategy \u2013 something that has proven vital in other countries.\nDominic Raab has warned the British public that lockdown measures could last into June and any relaxation now would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d. He set out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections but also pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said.

The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline, with an extension possible if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline.\nRoger Stone retrial bid fails \u2013 A federal judge has denied an application by Roger Stone for a new trial. The judge said there was \u201czero evidence of \u2018explicit bias\u2019 against Stone\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser. Next, Stone is expected to ask an appeals court to throw out his conviction. He has 14 days to do so. Stone was found guilty and jailed over his attempts to sabotage a congressional investigation that posed a political threat to the president.\nSaudi princess in plea from jail \u2013 A senior Saudi royal and granddaughter of the country\u2019s founding monarch has revealed she is in prison and demanded the current ruler and her cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, release her and provide medical care. Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz al-Saud says she is being detained without charge or explanation in Riyadh\u2019s al-Ha\u2019ir prison with one of her daughters.\nBasmah has campaigned for Saudi women\u2019s rights as well as calling for Saudi Arabia to change from absolute to constitutional monarchy.

But considering the running time is just 80 minutes, he seems to run out of ideas well before the final credits and the whole thing is wrapped up almost perfunctorily.\nThe setting is a remote sawmill, which we are led to believe will be the location for a siege. Its owner is Sa\u00efd (Sami Bouajila) who lives there with his teen daughter Sarah (Sofia Lesaffre). Perhaps against his better judgement, he has given a job to Yanis (Samy Seghir), a troubled young guy on parole for a minor offence. But Yanis hides a huge stash of cocaine at the mill, that was recently stolen by his half-brother, and soon the implacably ruthless gang boss Adama (Eriq Ebouaney) shows up with his heavily armed crew, wanting his merchandise back.\nNow, just as Chekhov said that a gun produced in act one has to be fired in act two \u2026 well, what must happen with a lethally sharp rotating sawmill blade produced in act one of an action thriller? Yet, when the inevitable arrives, it isn\u2019t sufficiently ingenious or climactic, and it\u2019s as if Leclercq (and co-screenwriters J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Guez and Matthieu Serveau) haven\u2019t any idea exactly how to play that one. The characters are sketched in too quickly for us to make any real investment in them: the movie stands and falls by its action, and for me it doesn\u2019t have the firepower, despite the deafening gunplay. It feels like the truncated version of a much longer and more thought-through film.\nEarth and Blood is available on 17 April on Netflix.",

        "content": "Plan establishes three phases for return to normal operations as top officials call for caution\nDonald Trump and his coronavirus taskforce have unveiled a set of federal guidelines for reopening the economy, which comprise three phases but ultimately defer to governors on when and how to return their states to normal.\nThe first phase allows for gradually returning to work while also minimizing non-essential travel. The second phase allows for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel. The third allows for schools and organized youth activities to open up as well as large venues to operate under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d. The third phase also allows bars to reopen but with \u201cdiminished standing room occupancy\u201d when possible.\nThe guidelines were unveiled at the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.\nEarlier in the day, Trump held a conference call with the country\u2019s governors to preview the guidelines. Trump said it was essentially up to them to lift their stay-at-home orders but encouraged them to do so if they saw no apparent health risk, a move that contradicted his previous claim of \u201ctotal authority\u201d to decide if and when a state should reopen. Likewise the new guidelines largely defer to governors to decide when to move to each phase. The guidelines represent a dramatic shift from the strict stay-at-home orders currently in place in many states. In unveiling them Trump made clear his eagerness to end the nationwide lockdown and return the American economy to its pre-coronavirus days.\n\u201cA prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression will inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. He claimed that would include \u201ca sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s top officials at the briefing stressed that states and governors must be cautious in relaxing guidelines in order to continue the country\u2019s modest progress in containing the virus.\n\u201cWe are slowing the spread, we are flattening the curve,\u201d said the vice-president, Mike Pence. \u201cIn a word, because of the actions of this president, this administration, governors at every level, our healthcare workers, and Americans, we\u2019ve saved lives and we can be comforted in that.\u201d\nBut officials praised the administration\u2019s progress in fighting the pandemic. In laying out the first phase of the guidelines, Dr Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce response coordinator, explained that some strict orders would have to stay in place.\n\u201cIf the schools are closed, they should continue to be closed,\u201d Birx said. \u201cGyms could open if they adhere to strict physical distancing.\u201d\nDr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines did not mark an immediate end to governors\u2019 coronavirus pandemic responses.\nA \u201clight switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here\u201d, Fauci said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to phase one until you get through the gating.\u201d\nTrump is optimistic that many states are ready to advance through the guidelines.\n\u201cI think 29 states are in that ballgame,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNot for opening, but I think they\u2019ll be able to open relatively soon. I think the remainder are just getting better. Look, New York, New Jersey are having very tough times and they\u2019ll be there. They\u2019ll be there at some point. But they\u2019re not going to be one of the earlier states.

        "content": "Ryan Tannehill was last year\u2019s feel-good story. Cam Newton and Marcus Mariota have a chance to take the crown whenever football season kicks off\nWe\u2019ve seen it a bunch of times: a second-contract quarterback who due to their own averageness or organizational incompetence is dumped from one team then experiences a Renaissance with another.\nOur latest example: Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was let go by the Dolphins after years of bang average interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance \u2013 most notably a season that was cut short by a knee injury when Tannehill looked like he had finally pieced it all together.\nThe Dolphins bailed. Tannehill was shipped to Tennessee. He rode the bench for a little while then took the lead role when Marcus Mariota was benched for his own stretch of mundane play. Then, liftoff.\nTannehill exploded into, legitimately, one of the five best quarterbacks in the league. That sounds like hyperbole, but it\u2019s a fact. By the metrics, Tannehill finished fifth or better in each of the following categories: DVOA, completion percentage under pressure, completion percentage to targets in tight coverage, completion percentage from a clean pocket, completion percentage on third downs.\nYou might be able to bluff one of the metrics, but not five. Most importantly, he ranked second in the league in big-time throws v turnover worthy throws, the single best measure we currently have of a quarterback as a \u201cpassing playmaker\u201d. He trailed only Russell Wilson and was comfortably ahead of Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.\nAnd the eye test was no different. Take the nameplate of his back and you would be conceived you were watching a perennial All-Pro: throws to all levels; consistently nailing the so-called bucket throw, dropping a pass over the top of a linebacker and in front of a rotating safety; throwing on the run; running; setting and resetting protections; taking command of the whole offense; making, big, BIG time throws on third downs, the one that decide a game or not.\nTannehill was reborn. And while it\u2019s tempting to scoff at the Titans putting out a massive contract to keep him around for the foreseeable future, what else were they supposed to do? Move on after witnessing that?\nTannehill will likely regress back to his mean: an above-average starter who needs a good deal of help around but who can move and create on third downs, create off-script, and has a cannon of an arm. But there\u2019s a chance, albeit a slight one, that something has clicked. That his second act is sustainable, if only for another season.\nSo, who\u2019s next? Across the league young veterans have switched teams, looking for a chance, any chance to land that sweet gig; that moment in time when an offensive guru meets a gifted offensive line, a pair of decent receivers and a complimentary running back. When perhaps a starter goes down and it\u2019s your time.\nThe two most fascinating possibilities: Marcus Mariota and Cam Newton.\nNewton, a former No 1 overall pick and 2015 MVP is still searching for a team after his release from the Panthers.\nOrdinarily, that would be bonkers. Whether you think Newton is on the downside of career or not, he remains a starting-caliber quarterback in a league that\u2019s lacking them. But Newton\u2019s checkered injury record makes any potential signing an impossibility right now.\nAny team who would be willing to commit big money to the 30-year-old \u2013 and Newton will likely command big money, even if only on a one-year deal \u2013 will want to work Newton out to make sure he still has the same oomph in his legs and zip on his fastball, not to mention have their own medical experts take a look at his files. Until the current global pandemic subsides, that\u2019s going to be a near-impossibility.\nAt the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He was a linebacker in the backfield, but one with just enough touch to shred defenses down the field. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks, leading the team to take a whole bunch of timing routes out of the system. It worked! Newton was pretty much unstoppable. But he\u2019s regressed since then. Injuries have taken over and his accuracy, which has always fluctuated based on his footwork, has become wince-inducing.\nBut think how wild that above paragraph is. How odd it is to write about the past being the peak of Newton\u2019s powers. Right now should be his peak. He\u2019s 30, still blessed with all the physical gifts he\u2019s always possessed but also with all the experience and savvy of a veteran. This is when he should be staking his claim as one of the league\u2019s five most important players on a consistent basis, serving as the linchpin of perennial Super Bowl contender, not sitting out as a street free agent trying to prove he still has it.\nThe spot that makes the most sense for a Newton comeback is in Los Angeles with the Chargers. Right now, LA lists Tyrod Taylor as its starter, with head coach Anthony Lynn saying he\u2019s \u201ctheir guy\u201d. The only issue, we\u2019ve seen systems built around Taylor before in Buffalo (with Lynn) and Cleveland. Neither started or ended particularly well.\nTaylor is a fine backup, but he\u2019s a couple of ticks below Newton on the quarterback index. If the Chargers want to move away from the dropback passing system they ran with Philip Rivers and commit to the spread option, why do that with a smaller, leaner version or Newton rather than the real deal? Taylor might be a little bit more accurate as a passer. But it\u2019s a nominal difference, and he\u2019s also far less aggressive. Rolling with Taylor is an admission that a team is happy to be average-to-bad.\nNewton, at least, improves that risk profile to good-to-bad \u2013 that\u2019s a gamble worth taking. Add to that, with Rivers leaving the Charges could use a little bit of star power, particularly as they get set to move into a new stadium. There are few higher-wattage stars in the league than Newton.\nOne other option: The Rams. Sean McVay\u2019s team is in cap hell and have been flogging assets. And you could make a decent argument, based on scheme-fit and accuracy without pressure, that you\u2019d rather have Jared Goff than Newton. But I\u2019d trust in McVay to adapt his system, and I\u2019d sooner take the quarterback who is the same when pressured and when not, rather than the guy who\u2019s accuracy and decision-making craters when there\u2019s pressure in his face.\nWould Newton be open to a one-year, cheap deal to work alongside McVay and make a potential Super Bowl run? The idea is fairly tantalizing.\nBut Mariota to the Vegas Raiders remains the most likely breakout/rebirth spot.\nMariota was lethal in college in an offense that weaponized his north-south speed and lightning-quick release. He was smart, played within himself, got the ball out on time, and was all about maximizing efficiency, both with his arm and legs. He\u2019s a timing player, not an oft-script creator. Planting him in a system that says control the game on first and second down then win it for us on third down was never his style; thrust into that position he crumbled.\n\u201cWe got to rebuild him a little bit to get his confidence back,\u201d Las Vegas general manager Mike Mayock said this week. By that, Mayock meant to restore him to his Oregon days. \u201cI mean, he went through \u2018Gruden\u2019s (QB) Camp\u2019 on television. I had him as the top quarterback in that draft. He knows that both of us believed in him coming out and still believe in him.\u201d\nIn Jon Gruden, Mariota finds a coach who sees his skills as a virtue, not a shortcoming. Is he a game-breaker? No. Can he efficiently take a team down the field, play within structure, make sure the team gets from a bad play into a good one, follow instructions, make throws on time and in rhythm, and lead a team to eight or nine wins, giving them a playoff shot? Sure.\nMariota will have to beat out Derek Carr, who is due for his own second act any year now. Carr has been solid if unspectacular since Gruden returned to the Raiders, happy to take on the coach\u2019s touchdown-or-checkdown mantra. But the fit remains iffy. Mariota\u2019s arrival, as well as a brief flirtation with Tom Brady, tells you all you need to know about how Mayock and Gruden view Carr\u2019s future with the team.\nWe love a redemption arc, that\u2019s just human nature. Tannehill was last year\u2019s feel-good story. Newton and Mariota have a chance to take the crown whenever football returns..",

        "content": "Protesters in Michigan and other states claim to speak for ordinary citizens, but are also supported by street-fighting far-right groups\nA wave of planned anti-lockdown demonstrations that have broken out around the country to protest against the efforts of state governments to combat the coronavirus pandemic with business closures and stay-at-home orders have included far-right groups as well as more mainstream Republicans.\nWhile protesters in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and other states claim to speak for ordinary citizens, many are also supported by street-fighting rightwing groups like the Proud Boys, conservative armed militia groups, religious fundamentalists, anti-vaccination groups and other elements of the radical right.\nOn Wednesday in Lansing, Michigan, a protest put together by two Republican-connected not-for-profits was explicitly devised to cause gridlock in the city, and for a time blocked the entrance to a local hospital.\nIt was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, which Michigan state corporate filings show has also operated under the name of Michigan Trump Republicans. It was also heavily promoted by the Michigan Freedom Fund, a group linked to the Trump cabinet member Betsy DeVos.\nBut the protest also attracted far-right protest groups who have been present at pro-Trump and gun rights rallies in Michigan throughout the Trump presidency.\nPlacards identified the Michigan Proud Boys as participants in the vehicle convoy. Near the state house, local radio interviewed a man who identified himself as \u201cPhil Odinson\u201d.\nIn fact the man is Phil Robinson, the prime mover in a group called the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page features pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front.\nThe pattern of rightwing not-for-profits promoting public protests while still more radical groups use lockdown resistance as a platform for extreme rightwing causes looks set to continue in events advertised in other states over coming days.\nIn Idaho on Friday, protesters plan to gather at the capitol building in Boise to protest anti-virus restrictions put in place by the Republican governor, Brad Little.\nThe protest has been heavily promoted by the Idaho Freedom Foundation (IFF), which counts among its donors \u201cdark money\u201d funds linked to the Koch brothers such as Donors Capital Fund, and Castle Rock, a foundation seeded with part of the fortune of Adolph Coors, the rightwing beer magnate.\nIFF have added their slogan for the event, \u201cDisobey Idaho\u201d, to stickers which they plan to distribute among the crowd.\nThe event is also being promoted on a website dedicated to attacking Little for his response to Covid-19. That website was set up by the Idaho businessman, pastor and one-time Republican state senate candidate, Diego Rodriguez.\nRodriguez launched the website at an Easter service held in defiance of the governor\u2019s orders on Easter Sunday, which was also addressed by Ammon Bundy, the leader of the militia occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016 that become a rallying point for the anti-government right in the US.\nBundy has been holding similar gatherings for weeks in Emmett, Idaho, where he now lives. On Sunday, he repeated his opposition to the Idaho orders, writing on Facebook: \u201cWe all have a duty to defend what is right and to make sure, that what God has given, man does not take away. Especially that great gift of agency, YES freedom!\u201d\nAda county, Idaho, where the capital, Boise, is located, has so far suffered 541 cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, in a state which has a far worse outbreak than neighboring Oregon, which is 2.4 times more populous.\nNevertheless, the ad for the rally on Rodriguez\u2019s website advises, \u201cWe feel that wearing face masks and gloves is counterproductive to the movement, and should be avoided.\u201d\nIn Washington state, meanwhile, which for now has brought one of the worst outbreaks in the country under a measure of control, a Republican state committeeman, Tyler Miller, has organized a protest at the state capitol on Saturday.\nMiller, who is active in the Kitsap county Republican party, was involved in passing a resolution in January in support of representative Matt Shea, who was excluded from the state house\u2019s GOP caucus after a report commissioned by house found that he had participated in domestic terrorism.\nHundreds of Facebook users have indicated that they will be attending his \u201cHazardous Liberty\u201d rally, and a parallel event in Richland, Washington.\nIncluded in that number are members of the 3% of Washington, a group which has held a series of open-carry rallies in Seattle, featuring speeches from the far-right protest leader, Joey Gibson.\nAs for Shea, he is speaking on Saturday at an online \u201cSaving America\u201d conference which will discuss an alleged erosion of rights \u201cthat\u2019s been ramped up in unprecedented ways during this Covid-19 crisis\u201d.\nHe is scheduled to appear alongside the likes of close ally Pastor Ken Peters, who has been holding monthly services outside Spokane\u2019s planned parenthood clinic; the actor, Maga personality and congressional candidate Mindy Robinson; and the New Zealand-based anti-communist speaker and author Trevor Loudon.\nOther similar events have been advertised for Saturday by an anti-vaccination activist in Oregon, and for Friday by a Boston group with alt-right connections.",

        "content": "Financial pressures including cost of PPE could lead to closure of many firms, say carer groups\nThousands of isolated, vulnerable people living at home face \u201cfalling through the cracks\u201d in the next two months unless the government steps in to protect them, the body representing their carers has warned.\nThe United Kingdom Homecare Association said financial pressures resulting from the coronavirus crisis, including the spiralling price of personal protective equipment, could force a significant number of the UK\u2019s 8,000 home care providers to close within weeks.\nSome providers of home care \u2013 already widely acknowledged to be the most fragile part of the social care system \u2013 have warned that vulnerable adults could face being abandoned to die alone at home.\n\u201cThe lessons learned too late in the residential care system are not yet being applied in the home care system, which suffers many similar problems and looks after far more people,\u201d said Colin Angel, the policy director for the professional association of home care providers from the independent, voluntary, not-for-profit and statutory sectors.\n\u201cHome care is the forgotten cousin of the already second-class social care sector, both in terms of lack of attention and understanding from government,\u201d he said.\nAbout 97% of the UK\u2019s home care is provided by independent providers. These providers make more than 1m visits a day to vulnerable people in their homes. But there is no centralised record of the numbers who rely on their support and very limited oversight of their financial stability.\nRaina Summerson, the chief executive of Agincare, one of the largest care groups in England, said: \u201cAll home care providers will do everything they can to keep care going. But we are already working on extremely tight margins and, with a lack of funding and sky-high costs of PPE, there will be providers who go bust.\n\u201cOvernight, local authorities will have the responsibility of picking up care for bankrupt providers but will not have resources to do so. It could well mean people left without care and, in the worst-case scenarios, falling through the cracks and dying alone at home.\u201d\nSelf-isolation and staff sickness means that home care providers are also having to rely on expensive agency staff during the crisis. At the same time, many have had clients cancelling their contracts because they are scared of infection.\nGill Heppell, the founder of the Nottingham-based home care provider PerCurra, said the cost of PPE was exorbitant while supply was short.\n\u201cMasks now cost \u00a311.95 each \u2013 and you have to buy 1,000. I am never going to need 1,000, and I hope I won\u2019t need them at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually buy two five-litre tubs of hand sanitiser for \u00a330. One tub now costs \u00a3100. Gloves usually cost \u00a31.90 for 100. Now they are \u00a320.\n\u201cMost of these are single-use items. One care worker can get through dozens of pairs of gloves a day. Home care providers won\u2019t survive in this environment. I have real concerns what will happen if government doesn\u2019t get this right.\u201d\nAngel said the lack of oversight increased the risk that if a small or medium-sized home care provider were forced to close, the people it cared for would not be picked up by the local authority in time.\n\u201cHome care providers suffer a number of problems, the most important being financial,\u201d he said. \u201cMost councils in England have not yet paid out any of the \u00a31.6bn that government has made available to them. At the same time, we\u2019re getting reports from some providers that they\u2019re not going to be able to pay their staff in the next payroll.\n\u201cThere are going to be a number of home care providers who will go to the wall in the next month or two because of the exponential increase in costs and an increase in the number of visits cancelled by councils and by people who fund their own care. That\u2019s the fear we\u2019re hearing now in the sector.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf there are a number of closures of providers in the same area, the local authority might well fail to identify everyone in need quickly enough to step in in time. Vulnerable people will fall through the cracks and not get the care they need.\u201d\nIan Hudspeth, the chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: \u201cThere are many and growing calls on the \u00a31.6bn funding and additional resources will be needed to allow councils to continue to support social care and other services.\u201d\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cOur adult social care action plan sets out how we are protecting workers by ramping up testing across the system for care workers and their families and we\u2019re ensuring millions of additional PPE items reach those on the frontline with local resilience forums identifying those most in need of more.\n\u201cThe secretary of state has written to local authorities, outlining how the \u00a31.6bn funding for local authorities should support adult social care providers and workers. To ensure this additional funding is making a difference, we are asking local authorities to provide information about the distribution of this funding to providers.\u201d\nCoronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

        "content": "The first 12-rated Bond film \u2013 and power-thighed assassin Xenia Onatopp in particular \u2013 seemed impossibly glamorous if you were just old enough to be admitted to the cinema\nHer name\u2019s Onatopp. Xenia Onatopp \u2026\nFamke Janssen\u2019s GoldenEye character is a transparently ludicrous fantasy of a sexy, so-called \u201cstrong female character\u201d; the definitive bad-ass Bond babe with thighs that can (and do) crush a man to death, and a line in double-entendres to make a drag queen blush. Let\u2019s face it, she practically is a drag queen \u2013 that flamboyant makeup, even when dressed in full military garb; the constant outfit changes; the pantomime orgasm every time a powerful weapon shoots its load (and yes, that is the calibre of double entendre we\u2019re dealing with here).\nShe is the reason Goldeneye was so important to me in 1995. She joined the pantheon of clippings from magazines that adorned my bedroom wall, the shrine to everything I considered attractive, aspirational or both. Between 1995, when Goldeneye came out, and my leaving for university in 2001, the lineup evolved. Blur and PJ and Duncan came down, replaced by pictures from FHM and Maxim, replaced in turn by clippings from Kerrang! of Marilyn Manson, Dexter from the Offspring and Davey Havok from AFI. But Xenia remained a constant, her image bleached by the sun over time until the red lipstick became pink.\nIn short, to my 12-year-old eyes, Onatopp was the definition of the perfect woman. GoldenEye was the first Bond film I saw at the cinema (the Tower Park leisure centre in Poole, a magical place where a sign used to boast that \u201ca galaxy of entertainment awaits\u201d), which may have had something to do with my infatuation. In one cinema trip, Bond went from something one might half-watch on television on a bank holiday to a transporting slice of silver-screen fantasy.\nWhile the intention of BBFC certificates may be to primly prescribe a minimum viewing age, they also often function as a guide to the ideal age to see the film in question. That\u2019s very much true of GoldenEye, which was the first Bond film to make use of the 12 certificate. While, to fully grown Bond fans, this may have signalled a toning down of the franchise (the previous entry, Licence To Kill, was a 15), to us 12-year-olds it meant something sophisticated and grownup had been created specially for us \u2013 like when the drinks industry invented alcopops. And I was only just 12, only just allowed to see something so hard and cool and dangerous, so I was desperately excited while trying hard to pretend it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, like all cool people.\nAnd boy, did GoldenEye deliver. From the opening action sequence with Bond diving off the massive Contra dam, to Sharpe from ITV (Sean Bean) getting killed in the line of duty (or was he?), to the first heady thrums of Tina Turner\u2019s still unbeatable Bond number, I was hooked. Even the opening credits were insane: a Hugh Hefner fugue state in which ladies open their mouths and guns come out. Are the guns sexy? Are the ladies sexy? What is going on?! I wasn\u2019t sure, but I was riveted.\nI rewatched GoldenEye a few weeks ago, chatting all the while with a group of friends over WhatsApp. It was the first full week of lockdown and we figured it\u2019d be a fun watch. It was, although there was also a fair bit of tedious exposition and some fun but unnecessary padding with Robbie Coltrane and an American guy. In my mind\u2019s GoldenEye, the film is nothing but suspenseful set-pieces and drama, and, of course, that big, man-crushing crush. But isn\u2019t that always the way when you look back at being 12? Nobody remembers the tedious exposition and unnecessary padding; when you look back it\u2019s all suspenseful set-pieces and drama. And of course, the crushes.\n This story was amended on 20 April 2020. The Bond film before GoldenEye was Licence To Kill, not The Living Daylights as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

        "content": "Leaders condemn backing of global sectors that disregard green economy goals\nPolluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections.\nThe moves by the fossil fuel, motor, aviation, farming, plastic and timber sectors are described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. Environmental campaigners describe some participants in these industries as \u201ccoronavirus profiteers\u201d.\nEconomic and energy leaders say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a safer, more resilient, world. However, such action has been lacking to date, they warn.\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: \u201cWhen I look at different parts of the world I have not seen yet a major emphasis on clean-energy technologies.\u201d He warned of mistakes similar to those made after the 2008 financial crisis when stimulus packages led to the biggest leap in carbon emissions in 50 years, four times greater than the reduction initially seen.\n\u201cIf we put the money in the right place, we can manage the [climate] risk, and have a much more modern, cleaner and safer energy system,\u201d Birol told the Guardian. \u201cBut if you put the money in the wrong place we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets.\u201d\nRachel Kyte, at Tufts University, US, a former UN special representative for energy and former World Bank Group vice president, said: \u201cCovid-19 puts our economies at a fork in the road. Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn\u2019t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn\u2019t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nUnlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery.\nFrans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the Green Deal at the European commission, said: \u201c[Tackling the Covid-19 emergency] cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity\u2019s most daunting challenges.\u201d\n\u201cBailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.\u201d\nThe nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery.\nLaurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France\u2019s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: \u201cWe know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.\u201d\nLord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: \u201cThe nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.\u201d But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors.\nMichael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. \u201cAs governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy \u2026 no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.\u201d\nBen Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. \u201cBut so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.\u201d\nThe course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. \u201cI think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.\u201d\nTimmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was clear about the need to rebuild a different global economy. \u201cEverything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.\u201d",

        "content": "Dedicated conservationists are striving to save the North Atlantic right whale \u2013 believed to be down to 400 individuals as ships and fishing gear take their toll\n\u201cYou can\u2019t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,\u201d Clay George tells me. He\u2019s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia\u2019s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear.\nRight whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths.\nThere are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world\u2019s oceans \u2013 estimates hover around 400 \u2013 that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as \u201cwhale lice\u201d.\nI want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were zero calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010.\n\u201cPeople always focus on the calves,\u201d George says. \u201cBut what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren\u2019t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.\u201d The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population.\nI mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. \u201cI remember when she had her first calf,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not a quick death,\u201d George adds. \u201cThey suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It\u2019s long and painful.\u201d\nGeorge has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He\u2019s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales\u2019 faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off.\nOne of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. \u201cWe assumed he was a goner,\u201d George says. \u201cBut he came back the next season, scarred.\u201d Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him.\n\u201cEighty per cent of right whales have scars,\u201d George tells me. \u201cAnd 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.\u201d\nRight whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the \u201cright\u201d and easy whale to hunt \u2013 docile, slow-swimming and huge \u2013 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons.\nOften referred to as the \u201curban whale\u201d, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species\u2019 only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training.\nNo one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we do know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40.\nThis year\u2019s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species. Plus, one of the 10 calves was probably mortally injured in a boat strike in the first days of its life. Make that a calving season of nine \u2013 less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves.\nWhy is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant \u2013 one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.)\n\u201cA species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,\u201d says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cIf you saw one, you\u2019d be struck by how majestic they are.\u201d\nThe whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called \u201cfixed gear\u201d fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from.\n\u201cMuch of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cPlus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It\u2019s a terrible conflict of interest.\u201d\nThe real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017.\nWhen I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen intend to catch whales. \u201cThey aren\u2019t doing it on purpose,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know they face hardships, too.\u201d\nAsmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: \u201cYou could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that\u2019s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.\u201d\nThere hasn\u2019t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. \u201cI think we\u2019re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,\u201d Asmutis-Silvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It\u2019s the most promising solution I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts.\nResearch shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years.\nThe right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season \u2013 its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel \u2013 is presumed dead.\n\u201cTrying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,\u201d Dr Genevieve Davis says. She\u2019s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal \u2013 when socializing in \u201csurface active groups\u201d they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,\u201d Davis says. \u201cA calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There\u2019s a masking effect that changes communication abilities.\n\u201cIf you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That\u2019s what their world is like now.\u201d\nThis human-caused \u201cacoustic smog\u201d travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert.\nPassive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult.\n\u201cNo tagging method is really long-term,\u201d Dr Davis says. \u201cThese whales are already endangered and many are in poor health \u2013 we don\u2019t want to cause more suffering.\u201d\n\u201cI look forward to the day when there aren\u2019t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,\u201d Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf.\n\u201cThere she was,\u201d Asmutis-Silver says. \u201cA tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity. The crazy thing is that Wart had been entangled several years prior. We thought she was dead \u2013 but here she comes back, free of gear, and gives birth in Cape Cod. It was incredible.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re so amazing \u2013 so resilient,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese whales have such an ability to recover if we would only give them the chance.\u201d\nClimate change is already acting as a cruel catalyst, warming the whales\u2019 habitat, causing currents to shift and altering the distribution of plankton the whales depend on. If these changes force the whales into new habitats with greater human activities but fewer protections, the results could be disastrous. This is exactly what appears to be happening in the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada, where more than 20 right whales (5% of the existing population) have been found dead since 2017.\n\u201cEverything we think we know this summer could be different two summers from now,\u201d Dr Fuller says.\n\u201cWatching right whales has been compared to watching the decline of vaquitas,\u201d Dr Fuller tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re watching the last ones die.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for the right whales\u2019 demise,\u201d she says, \u201cand we are responsible for saving them from extinction.\u201d\nIf you see a violation or injured animal, call the Northeast Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding and Entanglement Hotline: (866) 755-6622.

For example, in Pennsylvania, food banks are spending an extra $1m a week and yet still turning hungry families away.\nIn Alabama, one pantry looks set to go $3.6m over budget by August as food purchases and running costs \u2013 electricity, cleaning materials, boxes and overtime \u2013 have tripled: \u201cWe\u2019re applying for grants as fast as we can,\u201d said Jenny Waltman from Grace Klein pantry in Birmingham.\nThe recent rise in public donations is unlikely to offset projected shortfalls.\n\u201cWe have enough food for the next month,\u201d warned Lisa Scales, president of Pittsburgh food bank where the money spent buying food has tripled. \u201cWith so many businesses shutting, we\u2019re concerned community donations won\u2019t sustain this level.\u201d\nHow to help\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u00a0\nAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.\nDonate money or supplies\nThe Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.\nIf you want to help,\u00a0find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America\u2019s Covid-19 response fund.\nVolunteers\nFood banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u00a0Feeding America\u2019s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you\u2019re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, \u201cstay home\u201d is the advice.\nSocial media\nFeeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.\nThe economic fallout of the global health crisis has seen record numbers of first-timers \u2013 people who have never previously needed food aid \u2013 flocking to new drive-thru distribution centres, which have been created to comply with social distancing rules.\nQueues up to six miles long have become common at these pop-up collection points as far afield as San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Cleveland, where thousands of recently furloughed and unemployed people wait hours for grocery boxes.\nAs demand escalates, the price of non-perishable staples such as peanut butter, eggs, canned vegetables, beans, pasta, rice and jam is soaring, while supplies are running low with four- to eight-week delays and bottlenecks reported across the supply chain.\nThe wholesale cost of rice has almost tripled and won\u2019t be delivered until June, according to one Pennsylvania-based distributor that supplies more than 40 food banks. \u201cCanned fruit and veg are very hard to get, rice and pasta is challenging, and costs have gone crazy as manufacturers pay more for labor, food and transport,\u201d said Mike Fellinger.\n\u201cIf you find rice it\u2019s like gold,\u201d added Ron Mizutani, president of the Hawaii food bank.\nIn response, innovative schemes have emerged to take advantage of an abundance of perishable produce such as tomatoes, apples and milk which would otherwise be dumped or left rotting in fields. An estimated 30-40% of the US food supply is wasted, which is the equivalent to throwing out $161bn of produce annually.\nHowever, in one plan, Feeding Florida is paying local farmers to continue harvesting thousands of acres of crops, some of which is turned into freezable soups, sauces and ready meals by a network of idle restaurateurs.\nThe unfolding public health crisis has triggered the worst economic crisis in almost a century, exposing the precarious state of millions of working Americans thanks to weak labor rights, eroded government safety nets and low wages.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see so many \u2018new needy\u2019, when even before the pandemic, millions of working Americans were already living on the edge of poverty, making tough choices between food and rent and bills every month,\u201d said Ellen Vollinger, legal director at the Washington-based Food Research and Action Centre (Frac).\nIn 2019, about 40 million Americans received free meals or groceries through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, schools, soup kitchens and shelters, according to Feeding America. The working poor, elderly and disabled and infirm accounted for the vast majority of recipients.\nEven before the pandemic, half of American adults had either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate\u2019s 2019 financial security index.\nSince then, more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, though the true number of layoffs is probably significantly higher.\nUnsurprisingly, the demand for food aid has risen exponentially, and is mostly driven by first-timers, according to groups in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\nFor instance, at pantries in Silicon Valley, demand is increasing about 50% each week, with first-timers such as security and cafeteria staff furloughed by tech companies, teachers and restaurant workers accounting for more than half of those needing food.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising. We already knew a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Leslie Bacho, chief executive of Second Harvest food bank, which spent $250,000 on cleaning supplies in March.\nNo savings and staggering debts: in 2019 Americans owed $14tn including $1.3tn in car loans, $1tn on credit cards, $1.48tn in student loans and $9.4tn to mortgage lenders.\nIn Las Vegas, drivers of luxury vehicles queued for food boxes. \u201cWhen you see a Lexus in line at 4am prepared to wait six hours, you know there\u2019s real need,\u201d said Larry Scott from Nevada\u2019s Three Square food bank.\nIn Seattle, Washington, the Northwest Harvest food bank expects expenditure to increase eightfold to $8.4m a month through September.\nFeeding Alabama expects to spend $1.71m purchasing food by July \u2013 compared to $1.1m during 2018, and $543,443 in 2019 when food banks benefited from a commodities surplus created by Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars.\nIn Louisiana, at least one in three people are at risk of hunger, compared with one in five before this crisis, according to Natalie Jayroe, president of South Harvest food bank. \u201cWe think it will conservatively cost us $15m for six months \u2026 In south Louisiana, we\u2019ve been through our share of disasters but this is different.\u201d\nThe Greater Cleveland food bank could go $4.9m \u2013 or 26% \u2013 over budget by September. They have stopped buying peanut butter, a high-protein grocery box staple, since the price rose $10 a case.\nLast week in San Antonio, Texas, an unprecedented 10,000 people showed up in their cars for a pop-up distribution centre \u2013 a drive-thru service which typically attracted 400 before the layoffs. That day, 25 semi-trucks of food were handed out, much of it to newly laid off hospitality staff whose last paycheck was already gone, according to Eric Cooper, president of the food bank.\nAs demand rises, Cooper warns that supplies will run short: \u201cThe only thing we can do is ration and give families less \u2026 I would challenge our federal government to put systems in place that allow for wasted food to go to families we are feeding. It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d\nAs the coronavirus economic hurt intensifies, federal aid is slowly starting to trickle down to ordinary people, including the $1,200 stimulus payment for those with bank accounts.\nThe rescue packages did expand the food stamps programme (Snap), but the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has so far refused to fully extend eligibility using available disaster powers. \u201cThis would help tackle hunger and stimulate the economy, but for some reason the USDA isn\u2019t using all the tools in its box,\u201d said Vollinger from Frac.\nIt\u2019s unclear when or how the country will return to some semblance of normal, meanwhile America\u2019s hunger crisis is likely to last months \u2013 or longer.\nKristin Warzocha of Greater Cleveland said: \u201cI already fear we\u2019re not reaching everyone who needs help, and we haven\u2019t seen anything yet! We will do everything in our power, but philanthropy is not going to fix this crisis.\u201d",

        "content": "Scientists involved in Recovery trial, with over 5,000 test subjects, hope for answers within weeks\nThe world\u2019s biggest trial of drugs to treat Covid-19 patients has been set up in the UK at unprecedented speed, and hopes to have some answers within weeks.\nThe Recovery trial has recruited over 5,000 patients in 165 NHS hospitals around the UK in a month, ahead of similar trials in the US and Europe, which have a few hundred.\n\u201cThis is by far the largest trial in the world,\u201d said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at Oxford University, who is leading it. He has previously led Ebola drug trials in west Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nThe Recovery team expects to be the first to have definitive data. \u201cWe\u2019re guessing some time in June we may get the results,\u201d said Prof Horby. \u201cIf it is really clear that there are benefits, an answer will be available quicker.\u201d But he warned that in the case of Covid-19, there would be no \u201cmagic bullet\u201d.\nSymptoms are defined by the NHS as either:\nNHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nAfter 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nThe team is working against a backdrop of doctors globally using drugs that they believe could be a cure citing \u201ccompassionate use\u201d, without yet having good scientific evidence. Politicians are also wading in. Donald Trump has backed hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic form of the old anti-malaria drug chloroquine.\nUsed together with azithromycin, an antibiotic, it could be \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d, Trump tweeted. The French doctor Didier Raoult has claimed the combination is a cure, leading to public clamour for the drugs in France. President Macron visited Raoult\u2019s hospital in Marseille last week, giving him tentative support but suggesting that trials were needed.\nBoth hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being tested separately as part of the Recovery trial, and if there is any effect in patients given those drugs alone, compared with those given no drugs, they can be combined later.\nFor now, said Horby, the data flying around in emails from enthusiasts and posted on social media about patients who have recovered after taking hydroxychloroquine proves nothing. He says there is no real evidence to support its use yet.\n\u201cI would say no,\u201d said Horby. \u201cThere is in-vitro evidence that it is inhibitory against the virus [in the lab]. But I haven\u2019t seen any sound clinical data.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a large number of publications. It\u2019s hard to keep up with them. Most of them are very disappointing. There was a paper that said it was a breakthrough \u2013 chloroquine works. But there was zero data in it. It seems to follow in that vein. They show a certain percentage of patients recovering, which would happen anyway.\u201d\nThe hype and pressure cause problems for serious researchers. \u201cThere is pushback from clinicians saying we should just use this because it clearly works and shouldn\u2019t use that because it clearly doesn\u2019t work. They are both wrong because neither of them know.\u201d\nThe number of patients being enrolled on the Recovery trial across the UK tells a story of doctors who have faith in scientific evidence over hope alone. Ten per cent of Covid-19 patients in the UK are now taking part in the trial, and the researchers say the more people join, the sooner they will have answers.\nAlso in the trial now are a combination of two antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment, lopinavir-ritonavir, known by the brand name Kaletra, and low-dose dexamethasone, a type of steroid used in a range of conditions, typically to reduce inflammation.\nThe next one to be included, said Horby, is an interleukin 6 antagonist, one of the immunomodulator drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and to treat cytokine storm \u2013 something that happens when the immune system goes into overdrive, as can happen in Covid-19. They are looking at tocilizumab.\nThey are also in discussions about introducing convalescent plasma \u2013 blood from people who have recovered that contains antibodies against the virus. They want to trial remdesivir, but have not been able to obtain the stocks they need, because it is being tested in China and the US and because doctors are already prescribing it on compassionate use grounds.\nRepurposed drugs are first because they already have a proven safety record. But as experimental drugs come along, Recovery will include those. Patients are randomly allocated one of the drugs (or a placebo). There are already 500 to 900 patients on each of the drugs being tested and 2,000 in the control groups.\nThe UK trial was set up with unprecedented speed. The team went to see the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, to gain his support and enrolled the first patient nine days later. The NHS and National Institute for Health Research are on board. They recruited 1,000 patients within the first two weeks.\nMartin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, who co-leads the trial with Horby, says it\u2019s extraordinary and may change the landscape once the pandemic is over.\n\u201cOne of the things it tells you is what can happen when everybody is incentivised to make stuff happen as opposed to dither, delay or feelings that they will get into trouble if they say no,\u201d said Prof Landray, who has worked for 20 years on cardiovascular drug trials coordinated from Oxford. After this, he thinks, it will be hard to return to the snail\u2019s pace that has been the norm for setting up clinical trials in the UK, which can sometimes take years.\nThe second extraordinary thing is that the clinical care of the patients and the scientific rigour involved in trialling the drugs are hand in hand in a way that doesn\u2019t normally happen, where the research might be going on in one corner of the hospital. \u201cFrontline clinicians don\u2019t know which treatments are best for patients apart from supportive care or ventilation,\u201d he said. That gives them massive motivation to get involved in the trial, which is central to the care of the patient.\nHorby says it\u2019s unlikely they will come up with a quick cure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything like a magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to temper people\u2019s expectations about these drugs. It\u2019s possible some might have an effect, but it\u2019s likely to be modest. I think what we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of making a significant impact will be moving on to combinations once we know of things that work. If we combine antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they might have a bigger impact.\u201d\nHe holds out more hope for monoclonal antibodies, which worked in Ebola. \u201cIf you are saying this is an acute, serious viral infection, that\u2019s really difficult to treat, you can counter that with \u2026 well, look at Ebola. That\u2019s much nastier,\u201d he said. \u201cVery surprisingly, the monoclonal antibodies that were trialled in eastern DRC did work. Those are the ones we will be waiting for with a bit of bated breath to put into the trial when they become available.\u201d",

        "content": "The presumptive Democratic nominee is adapting as pandemic curbs have thrown traditional campaigning into disarray\nFormer vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign has had to adapt to both its new status as the Democratic party\u2019s presumptive nominee and as a candidate who can\u2019t leave his home to campaign due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThat means taking the fight to unseat Donald Trump from the White House in November almost entirely online.\nInstead of shaking hands in swing states or giving speeches in arenas, Biden\u2019s most visible moments in recent weeks have been in front of a camera broadcasting from his basement.\nBut the Biden campaign has begun embracing the new reality. He has started a regular podcast where he\u2019s interviewed political figures. Virtually every day his campaign airs a live stream of him taking questions or having a discussion with an elected official.\nRon Klain, a longtime aide to Biden, critiqued Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus in a roughly five-minute YouTube video. Biden over the various channels has focused on how he would approach the pandemic differently and what he sees as Trump\u2019s failures.\n\u201cI think his positioning on \u2018if I were president, this is what I would be doing\u2019 is a smart place to be,\u201d said veteran Democratic strategist Michael Halle, who recently served as a top adviser to the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\u201cI think people are looking for an alternative right now and also answers for \u2018how do we come out of this and how do we prevent this in the future?\u2019 And you see [the Biden campaign] starting to angle toward that and providing a longer-term vision which I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to get from Trump.\u201d\nBiden has upped the frequency of his appearances on television, appearing on major cable networks and local stations almost daily over the past two weeks. On Facebook, the Biden campaign more than doubled the amount of money spent on ads in the last week compared with the Trump campaign. Trump, though, has still spent more overall on that platform.\nBiden campaign fundraisers are also now virtual, changing the logistics of organizing them and who can appear as a headliner, including former rivals. The California senator Kamala Harris was the surprise guest at his second virtual fundraiser in April.\n\u201cIn some respects it does make the barriers to pulling off these things much smaller,\u201d Democratic strategist Eli Kaplan said.\nIn the next few weeks the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising schedule, according to a list obtained by the Guardian, includes a Women for Biden event headlined by his wife Dr Jill Biden and daughter Ashley Biden, a virtual fireside chat with the candidate, and another fundraiser in late April featuring celebrities Kristin Chenoweth, Melissa Etheridge, Billie Jean King and Billy Porter.\nThe campaign is also planning to set up a digital \u201cropeline\u201d where Biden can interact with voters.\nBut even with all those changes, Biden is still having difficulty competing with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Trump for attention during the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo\u2019s daily press conferences usually air live on all the major cable networks and the coronavirus taskforce briefing helmed by Trump has become a chance for reporters to ask the president questions in front of a televised audience.\nWhat\u2019s still unclear is how the coronavirus and the resulting state stay-at-home orders will affect Biden\u2019s field organizing as November\u2019s election heaves into view. The campaign is looking into coordinating virtual house parties as well.\nUsually, when a presidential candidate has vanquished all other rivals in their party he or she begins building a robust field program and conducts door-knocking to win over general election voters. But the pandemic means that part of campaigning is on hold and clouded with uncertainty.\nInstead of pounding pavements, campaign workers will have to leverage social media platforms to build that organization.\nThe Biden campaign utilized phone banking, texting to voters, and its support on social media in winning the set of Super Tuesday states in March.\u201cOur team has leveraged their expertise and talent to create powerful digital products that have harnessed millions of views, and as we continue our virtual campaign we will continue exploring creative and innovative formats while getting ready to grow,\u201d a Biden spokesman said.",

We hadn\u2019t slept for two nights or had a decent meal break and it was blowing a real gale.\u201d\nAs they went off for breakfast, Craigie-Halkett said that he spotted the wreck beginning to rock a little and a few bubbles rising from the seabed. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay as much attention as I would have if I had been fresh and perky but I realised later that the bubbles were caused by the suction breaking between the bottom of the ship and the seabed,\u201d he said.\nThey had settled down to eat when someone shouted: \u201cThe Britain\u2019s moving!\u201d Craigie-Halkett, a Falklands Islander who now lives in Hampshire, continued: \u201cWe went hell for leather back. She was starting to move.\u201d\nThey manoeuvred other vessels to nudge the Great Britain back to safety and switched off the pumps, which allowed it to rest back on to the seabed. \u201cShe could have drifted away and would almost certainly have been wrecked on the rocky outcrops nearby,\u201d said Craigie-Halkett. \u201cThe results would have been disastrous.\u201d\nDuring the subsequent days the ship was secured, and on 24 April 1970, SS Great Britain began an 87-day journey back to its home city of Bristol, with thousands turning out to welcome the ship back into the river Avon. The vessel has been gleamingly restored and is one of the south-west\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. Plans are afoot to celebrate the anniversary of the ship\u2019s return in the summer.\nLaunched in 1843, SS Great Britain was the first propeller-driven, iron-hulled steamship. After a successful career it was damaged in a storm and used as a storage hulk before being scuttled in 1937. The vessel remained in Sparrow Cove until the salvage plan was hatched to raise it and take it home.\nWhatley, also 78 and working as a gamekeeper in Wiltshire, said he did not know anything about the SS Great Britain before taking on the job to help save it.\nHe said the vessel they found was fragile. \u201cThe hull was full of mud and dirt and you could easily poke your finger through,\u201d he said. The water the ship was resting in was shallow but dark and cold and the salvage needed determination and ingenuity. As well as patching the holes they had to dig a tunnel in the seabed to reach the keel to carry out repairs there.\nDespite the frantic rush to save the vessel when it unexpectedly floated, Whatley had time to take in the sight of Brunel\u2019s ship rising up. \u201cThose sharp bows coming out of the water was the most magnificent sight I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d",

I still wake up gripped by anxiety and it can still take a couple of hours for me to feel brave enough to get out of bed, but for the rest of the day I can more or less function. Work provides both a distraction and an outlet for my feelings of powerlessness, pedalling up and down the same hill 10 times on my wife\u2019s (much too small) bicycle replaces cortisol with endorphins and our small back garden has been a haven in the good weather. So I am more than aware that I am so much more fortunate than many others in the current situation. It\u2019s when I start to think about the future that things rather fall apart. When will I next see my daughter in Minneapolis? We were due to fly over in August but, even if the flights are operational, would it be a good idea to go to the US with health insurance that is certain to exclude Covid-19? When will I next see my son in Brighton? When will I next see my mother? Her care home went into lockdown three weeks ago and has now reported its first suspected coronavirus case. So, she is lonely and frightened, confined to her room, seeing almost no one. These are the thoughts that dominate my subconscious and to which there are no clear answers. Which is presumably why I wake up in a complete state every morning.\nI can\u2019t help feeling that government ministers must be secretly wishing they had never agreed to give a daily Downing Street press conference. Obviously, given the gravity of the situation, they didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter but, having now watched every single one of them, it\u2019s now clear their main underlying purpose is to show just how little command of the situation ministers actually have and how policy is being made up day by day. Rishi Sunak has already delivered at least six new budgets since his first one on 11 March and looks set to hit double figures by the end of the month. Matt Hancock has managed to forget his first promise to deliver 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April \u2013 we\u2019re currently at about 16,000 \u2013 and has instead committed to 100,000 tests daily by the end of the month. He has also rather belatedly remembered he is secretary of state for social care as well as health, though care workers would probably more appreciate personal protective equipment and testing than his offer of shiny green \u201cCARE\u201d badges. And Sunak and Hancock are two of the more able cabinet ministers. After many complaints that the government was treating the coronavirus as man\u2019s work, the home secretary, Priti Patel, was sent out last Saturday to face the media. An experiment unlikely to be repeated. First Patel managed to imply that NHS workers were deliberately wasting PPE and then insisted that the government had so far carried out 300,034 974,000 tests. Which by my reckoning means that every person must have already been tested 4,615 times each. Her performance was so poor it almost made me wish that I worked on a Saturday.\nOne of the main problems with the daily press conference is that ministers have to pretend that they have some important news to divulge even when they almost invariably don\u2019t. In the absence of Boris they don\u2019t even dare to suggest what criteria might govern their thinking in any relaxation of the lockdown, which gives each briefing a sense of deja vu. One of the most annoying parts of every ministerial statement is the constant reiteration of the mantra that \u201cthe government\u2019s actions have at all times been driven by the science\u201d. Mostly because that merely serves to underline just how little the government actually understands the nature of science. The whole point of science \u2013 especially in regard to a disease as new as the coronavirus \u2013 is that there is no overall consensus. Disagreement and pressure-testing each other\u2019s arguments are precisely what makes scientists and other academics tick. So there is no uniformity and the government is having to make judgment calls on which scientists are the most trustworthy. Donald Trump is clearly doing that, having rubbished the World Health Organization for having less of a grip on the science than a couple of his close mates. And yes, the UK government has been too craven to call the Donald out on this. Nor does the UK\u2019s insistence on scientific evidence quite explain why the government did a complete U-turn nearly four weeks ago. On the Friday, it had been fine for 80,000 people to go to the Cheltenham races; by the following Monday the country was being put in near total lockdown. I don\u2019t remember anyone saying the science had changed over the weekend.\nMy concentration levels are still hopeless. I have done slightly better this week, having now made it to page 10 of Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror and the Light and I can report the extra six pages are every bit as good as the first four that I had already read several times. It\u2019s immensely frustrating as there\u2019s nothing more I would like than to be immersed in someone else\u2019s world, but my mind won\u2019t allow me to settle. I\u2019m reluctant to temporarily give up as I hate the idea of abandoning a book I have waited the best part of eight years to read, but I fear this is the way I\u2019m heading. After all, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m not spoiled for choice as I have Hadley Freeman\u2019s House of Glass, Adam Macqueen\u2019s Beneath the Streets and Svenja O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Inge\u2019s War piled up beside my bed. I did also have Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet but my wife has already pinched that and has advised me not to read it at present. It\u2019s set against the background of plague and she is worried about the effect it might have on my mental health. I\u2019ve also been struggling to dip in and out of this year\u2019s Wisden because, although the pieces are an ideal length, the print is just too small. My eyesight is fighting a losing battle with the almanack and I fear that next year I may have to order the large print edition. In the meantime, I have come up with a reasonable compromise by downloading it as an audible book. It calls itself the Shorter Wisden \u2013 mainly because it doesn\u2019t give you the scores of every game \u2013 but still comes in at over 20 hours. And at \u00a310, I reckon 50p an hour is a bargain.\nApparently it\u2019s Friday, though it\u2019s hard to be too certain as the days all tend to merge into one another with little to differentiate them. Same feelings, same activities, much the same TV. Weirdly it\u2019s the weekends I now find trickiest as they have even less structure than the weekdays. I have to struggle more to find a sense of purpose and retain my fragments of identity. But when this lockdown started I made a commitment to try to end every week on a positive note, so here are my notes of love among the ruins. I would rather I didn\u2019t have to look at myself during online calls \u2013 do I really look that bad? \u2013 but FaceTime and Zoom chats both with family and friends have proved to be a lifeline. Although they are reminders of the closeness that has been lost, they do give me a sense of connection. And I\u2019ve been genuinely touched by the number of readers who have emailed in to check up on me, to share their own thoughts and send me photos; I\u2019m also happy to report that Herbert Hound has now adjusted to the new normal. Initially he was rather put out to find that Jill and I were around 24/7 and he would self-isolate in our daughter\u2019s bedroom. But now he seems to need less \u201cme time\u201d and has come back to sleep in our room. I have finally finished cataloguing my book collection and am about to start on the ceramics: a far trickier enterprise as it involves including pictures and my tech skills are rudimentary at best. I will report back. Incidentally, I have taken to talking to my pots ... I fear I may be turning into Prince Charles. Also huge kudos to the Spurs\u2019 players and the supporters trust who persuaded the club to reverse its decision to furlough and lay off non-playing staff. It made me feel proud to be a fan again. And finally, do watch Harry Birrell Presents Films of Love and War on iPlayer. It\u2019s an astonishingly moving and intimate collection of homemade movies collected into a feature length film. I cried. But then I tend to do that a lot these days.\nDigested week, digested: Same as it ever was",

        "content": "Reinventing courses that rely on physical contact is a challenge, but digital training could be the perfect curtain-raiser into theatre\u2019s brave new world\nLike so much else in this current crisis, theatre training and education changed overnight. On the evening of Sunday 15 March, I and many others teaching at universities and drama schools were looking ahead to a week of lessons and wondering how to socially distance on the commute. By Monday afternoon, the shutters were coming down at higher education institutions across the country. Learning was suddenly a remote activity.\nUniversities and drama schools are now closed for the rest of the academic year, with teaching and assessment having shifted online. It\u2019s a challenge for everyone, but especially for those subjects \u2013 like theatre \u2013 that usually rely on physical presence and contact. Just as theatres and artists are exploring ways to share their work digitally, teachers are suddenly forced to reimagine their courses for the online environment.\nDrama schools have a particularly tough task. As Lamda\u2019s director Sarah Frankcom stresses, it\u2019s important to recognise that some aspects of actor training need to happen in a live space. \u201cThere is no point us pretending that we could do everything online,\u201d she says, adding that the school has thought carefully about which elements of its teaching can be delivered digitally.\nShe is echoed by Edward Kemp, director of Rada, who says: \u201cWe know we won\u2019t be able to recreate an identical experience to face-to-face teaching.\u201d Similarly, Guildhall School has taken the decision to defer some teaching until the autumn, when they hope that they can return to face-to-face learning.\nSchools are trying to respond creatively to the pandemic. First-year acting students at Guildhall are devising a piece of online work about coronavirus with a professional theatre-maker, while the school is putting together a \u201cvirtual festival\u201d of workshops, masterclasses and projects for final-year students.\nOne of the challenges is how to hold on to the collaborative and collegial aspects of theatre training while maintaining social distancing. Rada students are remaining in touch through a weekly newsletter where they can share ideas. Another solution is suggested by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which has set up a digital platform called RCS at Home to keep students and staff connected. The platform includes music, screenings, messages, advice and talks from researchers.\nA virtual scratch space has been created for Lamda students to share the creative work they\u2019re making, while the focus of much of the school\u2019s teaching has turned to individual development of voice and movement. Students record themselves completing physical or vocal exercises and share these with their teachers before receiving one-to-one feedback. \u201cThe teacher is coming in later in the process but with more specialised attention,\u201d explains Frankcom.\nOne silver lining of this difficult situation is the solidarity and support emerging in a sector that\u2019s often forced to compete for students and resources. Across Google docs, Facebook groups and Zoom webinars, teachers of theatre from all over the world are sharing techniques and ideas, from movement exercises on TikTok to online improv games. As Frankcom and others emphasise, educators will need to collectively reflect, share and work together to get through this crisis.\nFor students who are due to graduate this summer and whose final performances and showcases have been cancelled or postponed, the impact of the pandemic is devastating. Drama schools including Mountview and Guildford School of Acting have responded by creating online showcases for their graduating students, while final-term productions at Lamda and in many university drama departments have been reinvented as online projects.\nThe theatre industry has also got creative, setting up various networks of remote support for students. Actors Olivia Beardsley and Isaac Stanmore have set up an online showcase platform for graduating drama school students, while Twitter is full of offers of help, advice and publicity. Rather than cancelling, the annual National Student Drama Festival moved rapidly online, offering more than 30 free workshops over Zoom and Facebook in the first week of April.\nAll this might just be a taste of what\u2019s to come. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea what industry we\u2019re training them for now,\u201d says Frankcom, speculating that parts of the theatre-making process might continue to take place remotely for months or even years. It\u2019s important that students are fluent in digital creation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a responsibility to get our students as confident and as playful and as creatively in tune as possible with the platforms they\u2019re now using,\u201d she says.\nShe and Kemp stress the importance of supporting wellbeing and resiliencee. \u201cStaff and students are adapting to working in less than ideal situations, whether because of worries about family and friends, access to technology, or sharing living and working spaces,\u201d says Kemp.\nBut there may be unexpected opportunities for the students who are training during this crisis. \u201cThey will be the first year that\u2019s straddled both worlds,\u201d Frankcom suggests. \u201cThey can be ahead of the curve.\u201d This situation also poses for drama students the same daunting yet creative question that theatre-makers everywhere are now facing: \u201cHow do you respond as an artist to living in an extraordinary time?\u201d",

        "content": "American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space Station\nThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.\nSpace travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio\u2019s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.\nMorgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.\nThe trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.\n\u201cPlease keep your distance,\u201d one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia\u2019s space agency.\nFollowing the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we\u2019re truly going back to a different planet,\u201d Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.\n\u201cWe were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren\u2019t.\u201d\nIsolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.\nOn Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.\nEven minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.\nDue to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.\nAstronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation.\n\u201c[It\u2019s like] where were you when JFK was shot, where were you when we landed on the moon and where were you when coronavirus was happening, and I\u2019ll have my own interesting story to tell in years to come,\u201d he told the Associated Press.",

        "content": "From donning school uniform to raiding the fancy-dress box, readers share how they are dressing while they are forced to work in the house\nTwo weeks ago, Bonita Waldman put on a gold lam\u00e9 dress that had been crocheted by her 94-year-old mother 40 years ago. \u201cIt made me feel close to her,\u201d she says. Her mother was very ill in a care home at the time. Waldman couldn\u2019t visit her, or see anyone else, because of the lockdown. So she worked from home wearing extraordinary outfits and posting the results on Facebook to \u201ccheer up\u201d her friends.\n\n She sent a photograph of herself wearing the dress to the care home where the staff printed it out to show her mother. Tragically, her mother died before she could see it. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad story,\u201d says Waldman, \u201cbut it is also a happy one in a way, because I have these dresses that she made.\u201d Waldman says she will wear more of her mother\u2019s exquisite creations during lockdown, including the wedding dress her mother crocheted for her, as well as \u201cfunny outfits\u201d \u2013 such as a flamenco dress \u2013 to raise friends\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 spirits, as well as her own.\nWe asked our readers what they were wearing in lockdown. Some of the stories, such as Waldmans\u2019, were more poignant than we could ever have anticipated. Some readers said they were simply relieved to be spending more time in elasticated waistbands. Many readers were using clothing as a means of comfort, distraction and fun.\n\u201cI always choose clothes that lift my mood,\u201d says London-based sewing teacher and fashion designer Karen Arthur (pictured in main image). \u201cMaking an effort helps me to feel a little better.\u201d She made her outfit out of a pair of curtains her friend Ian found in his dad\u2019s attic. Although Arthur\u2019s business has ground to a halt, she is making face masks instead. \u201cI brought my sewing machine and some fabrics home with me just before lockdown was announced, thank goodness,\u201d she says.\nMany of us might feel a bit Miss Havisham all dressed up home alone, but Arthur is far from alone in dressing brightly at this dark time. \u201cMy friends and I have made a pact to wear beautiful long party gowns to the supermarket the next time we shop in Sainsbury\u2019s,\u201d says Rachel Bailey-Hogg, who is a lecturer. \u201cIt\u2019s all a giggle and hopefully makes others smile too.\u201d\nHen, an events assistant from Bristol (pictured in main image), is another believer. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty much forcing myself to wear as much bright colour as possible,\u201d she says, \u201cto trick myself into brightening my mood and not feeling quite so scared. It\u2019s been a partial success. I\u2019d describe myself as a fairly bold dresser anyway \u2013 I\u2019m known at work for wearing big novelty earrings \u2013 so I\u2019m trying to lean into that and make WFH as much fun for myself as I can.\u201d\nAnother vivid dresser, Lizzie, wears a cardigan which recalls the children\u2019s rainbow drawings that adorn windows across the UK. This, she says of her outfit, \u201cis peak work-from-home chic. The skeleton leggings cost a fiver and the bones glow in the dark.\u201d\nSome readers are using clothing to recreate the rhythms of a normal week. \u201cGetting dressed in the morning motivates us to get up and start the day \u2013 as does coffee. It is a small daily ritual that gives us something to look forward to,\u201d say 28-year-old art student twins Becky and Alex Chipkin.\nAntonia, 38, has instigated \u201cfancy Fridays\u201d for video calls with her colleagues. \u201cIt makes Friday morning feel like the evening preparations before going out,\u201d she says. Online, attempts to make Fridays feel special through clothing proliferate, with hashags including #DressUpFriday and #FormalFridays often trending on social media.\nThe popular style blog Man Repeller has struck a nerve with the hashtag #goingnowherebutfuckitimgettingdressed, with almost 7,000 people posting photographs of isolation outfits on Instagram.\n\u201cFor many people, dressing is a survival mechanism and at the end of the day, from the most trivial to crucial corners of the human experience, that\u2019s all any of us are trying to do,\u201d says Leandra Medine, founder of Man Repeller. Her own strategies include a dress code for \u201cdate nights\u201d with her husband, in which both parties are \u201crequired to get dressed, even put on shoes, to meet in the living room\u201d.\nThat makes sense to psychologist Dr Carolyn Mair. \u201cNot knowing when this lockdown will end really is stressful for us \u2013 we feel a lack of control,\u201d she says. \u201cGetting dressed is a form of taking control and structuring our day and reassuring ourselves that we have not lost our value. Routine is hugely important.\u201d\nSome are dabbling with fancy dress in lockdown. Online, photographs of digital project managers wearing jester hats or archaeologists dressed as Power Rangers in Zoom meetings proliferate. Jo Parry, from Cardiff, has pledged to wear a different costume every day, ranging from Cruella de Vil to Gollum. Ella, a 34-year-old climate change scientist, has been raiding her festival fancy-dress box since lockdown began. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fall into the trap of spending all day mooching around in pyjamas, so I decided to wear something every day that I couldn\u2019t wear to work,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has raised more than a few smiles when I\u2019ve been out for my daily dose of fresh air.\u201d\nJust as many seasoned home-workers extol the mind-focusing values of wearing shoes indoors, some head teachers have advised children to wear school uniform for home schooling, in order to make the \u201cmental switch\u201d required for learning. One reader, Si\u00e2n, a single parent and film and TV lecturer from Carlisle, has taken this further for morale-boosting purposes. \u201cHaving to work from home while also overseeing my daughter\u2019s education and daily activities has been tough,\u201d she says, \u201cso I decided to make it a bit more fun by dressing in our \u2018business pyjamas\u2019.\u201d\nPersonal sartorial challenges abound. Some are crafty and intimate: Gina Bennett and Ron Evans have transformed one of Evans\u2019s old T-shirts into a top for Bennett and are now wearing matching outfits for \u2013 they insist \u2013 the first time ever.\nAlex Pratchett, from Oxford, a \u201ckit geek\u201d who draws footballers for a living, is alleviating football withdrawal symptoms by wearing \u201ca different football shirt every day until the lockdown ends. If I run out of shirts before it\u2019s over, the virus wins. If nothing else, it will help mark the passage of time, as I was previously struggling to remember which day of the week it was,\u201d he says.\nOnline, creative types whose working lives have stopped abruptly have been using their wardrobes as performance art. Andrew Downs, of the set designers James English Productions, for example, has been wearing vintage clothing to stage baroque, Acorn Antiques-like tableaux for Instagram with his mother and husband. Dressing up, he says, brings \u201cstructure. Otherwise you are changing from your day pyjamas into night pyjamas.\u201d\nBut for every person extolling the mood-lifting benefits of dressing as they would have done four weeks ago, there is another revelling in the opportunity to shed their skin.\nMatt Hepworth, from Bristol, speaks for many in gravitating towards one well-worn item of clothing, in his case a \u201ccomfy old raving hoody\u201d because, he says, it \u201cmakes me feel young, is warm and I wouldn\u2019t dare ever wear it to work\u201d.\nColin, a library assistant in Scotland, is \u201cusually fairly respectfully dressed\u201d at work in a uniform of lilac shirt and smart trousers. The upside of working from home, he says, is getting to wear his favourite band T-shirts. \u201cI wonder if many of the library users would know how much I am into heavy metal, doom metal, heavy rock, grunge and other noisy music genres,\u201d he says.\nTeacher Emma Leslie is working her way through her wardrobe of casual clothes, which she would never be able to wear at school due to a strict dress code. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the most practical thing to be doing but it does help to take my mind off the situation,\u201d she says.\nDressing without an audience has proved liberating for many. \u201cMy current job is the first place I\u2019ve ever worked where I am out as both queer and non-binary,\u201d says H, a 27-year-old computer programmer. \u201cWorking from home has been an interesting experiment as I tend to see connections between my gender and my clothing choices quite a lot. It\u2019s been nice to experiment more with my femininity from the comfort of my own home without the pressures of how I might be perceived by the outside world.\u201d This dress, they say, is a favourite: \u201cIt\u2019s super-light and floaty, which puts me in a good positive headspace.\u201d\nOne anonymous 24-year-old says: \u201cI am female, blond, rather petite and have an accent when speaking in English. I was convinced that my appearance decreased my credibility in a rather male-dominated, imposing and English-native environment.\u201d In the office, she says, she was a \u201cpower dresser\u201d and saw blazers and heels as a way to appear more \u201cconfident and convincing\u201d. After a few days of working from home, \u201cI got more and more comfortable in my casual clothes. I am now receiving calls without video,\u201d which she feels has \u201cbalanced out the power dynamics\u201d.\nJogging bottoms have never seen so much action. In these unanchored times, even US Vogue editor Anna Wintour has been photographed wearing them. Jyoti, who lives in London, says: \u201cI\u2019m always having to think about that top half people would see on teleconferences but, unless I have to stand up, no one knows what lies under that top half. It\u2019s going to feel weird to go back to smart trousers.\u201d\nBut do clothes really help lift our spirits? Carolyn Mair, believes so, citing a 2012 study in which participants\u2019 ability to pay attention sharply increased when they wore a white coat they believed had belonged to a doctor. What the study suggests, she says, is that it is our own beliefs about our clothes \u2013 the stories we attach to them, for example \u2013 that can make a difference to our behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s the power of the belief of the wearer,\u201d she says. In other words, one person\u2019s immaculate printed dress is another\u2019s decades-old raving hoodie. And if it works for you, wear it.",

The mood in several camps had been to dig their heels in and push for a deferral but all parties are now believed to have accepted the suggestion and there is confidence that it will be confirmed over the weekend.\nMikel Arteta\u2019s influence has been described by those familiar with the talks as crucial to the change in attitude among the 27-man squad. The head coach spoke to his players in a video call on Wednesday night, making it clear that he would not engage them in discussions about money in any ordinary kind of situation.\nIn what is believed to have been something akin to a teamtalk, Arteta urged his players to stick together and take a strong collective stance in supporting their club through the unprecedented financial maelstrom brought about by Covid-19. He is also understood to be discussing a pay cut of his own.\nIt means Arsenal will make significant inroads into their annual wage bill, which totals around \u00a3230m, although the players will get their money back in the event that they bridge an eight-point gap and qualify for the Champions League when football restarts.\nA unanimous decision to accept the proposal should also mean they avoid the potentially thorny issue of individual negotiations with players whose salaries, in some cases, differ significantly \u2013 although the longer-term impact it might have on contract negotiations for players such as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka, whose deals expire in the summer of 2021, is unclear.\nDespite the original impasse, discussions are understood to have been constructive and positive, with all sides aware that goodwill was required in an unprecedented set of circumstances. The players\u2019 agreement will mean figures across the club\u2019s upper echelons will have contributed to securing the club\u2019s finances.\nOn Wednesday, Arsenal announced that their executive team \u2013 including the chief executive Vinai Venkatesham and the head of football Raul Sanllehi \u2013 would waive more than a third of their earnings over the next year. It is also understood that Stan Kroenke, the club\u2019s owner, has made a significant contribution to shore things up, although the precise nature of that injection \u2013 whether it is via cash or a loan \u2013 remains to be seen.",

        "content": "A lengthy 2017 interview, to be streamed online, shows the acting great opening up about her craft and sharing priceless memories \nOne of the many tantalising shows lost to the lockdown was I Remember It Well at London\u2019s Bridge theatre, in which Judi Dench was to reminisce about her career in conversation with Gyles Brandreth. There is talk of it happening at a later date but in the meantime Dench-watchers can catch a recording of a conversation, filmed in 2017, between the great Dame and Brandreth at the Orange Tree. Declaration of interest: I too have done one of these public chats at the Richmond venue. I would still say this is engrossing viewing that gets way beyond the kind of anecdote-swapping you find on a Graham Norton sofa and that offers a good deal of practical wisdom about the art of acting.\nThere are, of course, one or two familiar stories. We hear about the film producer who once brusquely told Dench: \u201cYou have every single thing wrong with your face.\u201d We also hear how, when Dench as an Old Vic Juliet passionately cried, \u201cWhere are my father and my mother?\u201d, the audible response was \u201cHere in Row H\u201d (a story I\u2019ve always found somewhat incredible since her parents, long involved in the York Mystery Plays, were hardly naive theatregoers). But many of the stories are fresh and funny, including one that shows that John Gielgud, normally regarded as the high priest of British acting, had a sense of mischief that more than matched Dench\u2019s own.\nDench, filmed before an audience largely composed of drama students, also reveals a lot about her craft. Quizzed by Brandreth about her debut as Ophelia at the Old Vic in 1957, she recalls how she over-complicated her performance. \u201cI\u2019d know what to do now,\u201d she says. \u201cYou only have to do one thing to indicate madness.\u201d Tellingly, she also reveals that during a four-year stint at the Vic from 1957 to 1961, she would stand in the wings and avidly watch her colleagues: \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn.\u201d I also loved her comment about directors who seek to induce an ensemble spirit by getting actors to toss around a fluffy ball. \u201cDirectors,\u201d says Dench, \u201cunderestimate actors\u2019 instinctive ability to create a sense of company.\u201d\nNot that Dench is anti-director \u2013 although she wincingly recalls how she was brutally treated by Michel Saint-Denis in a 1961 production of The Cherry Orchard: \u201cTo think,\u201d Peggy Ashcroft consolingly told her, \u201cI nearly married that man!\u201d But Dench is full of praise for Peter Hall and his approach to Shakespeare\u2019s verse \u2013 \u201cHe stood at a lectern and made you obey the way it is written\u201d \u2013 and for Hal Prince who cast her as Sally Bowles in Cabaret after seeing her in a play called The Promise. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sing in The Promise,\u201d notes Brandreth. \u201cI didn\u2019t sing in Cabaret either,\u201d Dench retorts.\nThis is a wonderfully relaxed conversation in which Brandreth skilfully steers Dench through her life and times and shows that she is as quick-witted and effervescent as ever. But the most revealing moment comes when she recalls something John Neville told her early on in her career: \u201cYou must decide why you are doing this job and then never tell anyone.\u201d Looking squarely at Brandreth, Dench says: \u201cAnd I never have.\u201d If I were to make a wild surmise, I would say that her dedication to acting is tied up with her Quaker faith, about which she says little in the interview. But that is only my guess; and one of the many delights of this film is that Dench is very open about her craft while preserving the mystery that is essential to great acting.\nDame Judi Dench in Conversation is available to watch on demand from 3pm on 26 April",

        "content": "UK wildlife watchdog under fire as conservationists say decision \u2018sends wrong message\u2019\nConservationists have condemned the decision to allow falconers to take wild peregrine falcon chicks from nests as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201csending the wrong message\u201d.\nFor the first time ever this year, Natural England, the government\u2019s wildlife watchdog, will allow the taking of six chicks from peregrine nests to help falconers establish a lucrative new \u201cstudbook\u201d of British falcons.\nPeregrine falcons \u2013 the fastest species on the planet, reaching more than 200mph during dives for prey \u2013 were threatened with extinction as a breeding bird in the 1970s. Numbers have recovered to 826 breeding pairs in England, with many nesting on cathedrals and tall buildings in cities, where they are free from persecution.\nThe RSPB said it was \u201curgently\u201d seeking answers from Natural England about how it made its decision and feared the licence could \u201copen the door\u201d to more applications.\nMark Thomas, the RSPB\u2019s head of investigations, said: \u201cThe cultural value of these birds is that they are free, wild and available to all. The application will therefore be regarded by many as selfish \u2013 it should be reconsidered in light of alternative solutions, and in the context that peregrines suffer from illegal persecution, trade and loss of breeding range.\u201d\nWhile all nesting birds are legally protected, licensing the removal of chicks for falconry is permitted under wildlife laws. Falconers argue that their current captive birds are not verifiably British birds and EU regulations permit the sustainable use of species for cultural purposes.\nUnesco recognises falconry as an \u201cintangible cultural heritage of humanity\u201d and the ancient practice is increasingly lucrative, with birds changing hands for as much as \u00a36,000 to supply the sport of falcon-racing in the Middle East. Three falconers will remove chicks from nests in England, although they will not be allowed to do so in parts of northern England where the peregrine is still threatened.\nNatural England said its licence would only allow a chick to be taken from a nest where there were three or more chicks present. The falconers must only take the smallest, weakest chick, which would not ordinarily survive in the wild. It said it would be \u201cclosely monitoring the operation\u201d and could revoke the two-year licence at any time.\nOne falconer behind the attempt to establish a captive population of indisputably British birds, Gary Wing, told Mark Avery\u2019s blog that there was \u201cno commercial interest\u201d in the scheme, which would be costly for falconers to establish.\nUntil the introduction of DNA testing of captive birds in the 1990s, peregrines were regularly and illegally taken from the wild.\nDavid Lindo, a conservationist known as \u201cthe urban birder\u201d, said he was dismayed at the decision.\n\u201cIt sends the wrong message,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough birds in captivity. If you\u2019re going to be doing falconry, use the birds in captivity. What is wrong with them? Someone is making money from this somewhere along the line \u2013 what sort of message does this send around Europe and the Middle East? It validates the idea that the peregrine is not a species in decline and we can take some more from the wild.\u201d\nJade Emery, wildlife campaigner for Animal Aid, said it was \u201ca huge step backwards\u201d for wild bird protection.\nShe said: \u201cWhile Natural England attempt to dignify falconry by describing it as \u2018an ancient tradition\u2019, it is in fact just outdated. Taking animals from the wild and subjugating them for entertainment or sport is fundamentally wrong, should be consigned to history, and is certainly not something that should be supported by Natural England. The wellbeing of these majestic birds should be prioritised over this outdated and cruel hobby, and this decision should be quickly reversed.\u201d\nDr Gordon Mellor, chairman of falconry organisation the Hawk Board, said: \u201cFalconers across the world have controlled access to wild populations of raptors following the principles of sustainable use. In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice.\n\u201cUK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.\u201d",

She promised to treat the Scottish public \u201cas the grown-ups that you are\u201d, and share \u201cas much detail as I can\u201d on plans for an eventual emergence from lockdown and future management of the coronavirus.\nSpeaking directly to the public at her daily briefing, she said: \u201cThe challenge we face is to find a balance that allows us to suppress and control the virus and and minimise absolutely the damage it can do, while also allowing life to go on, if not completely as normal, then at least in as normal a way as is possible.\n\u201cWhile we know that the current lockdown measures are essential, we also know that they bring serious consequences of their own and these may also be measured in lives lost and life changes curtailed.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI want to stress again that the government will be as open as we can be. To be blunt, I will treat you, the public, as the grown-ups that you are and try to share the really difficult judgments and balances we will have to strike.\u201d\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has previously called for more details to be disclosed about how the UK government plans to leave the lockdown, but earlier on Friday the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, warned against confusing the public message. He told BBC Radio Scotland: \u201cI would suggest that this is not the time to muddy the message by talking about exit strategies or getting into arguments about sectors or geography or demographies or anything else.\u201d\nAsked about Jack\u2019s remarks, Sturgeon told reporters: \u201cThis virus doesn\u2019t respect borders or boundaries, that is obvious ... that is why the Scottish government has been working so carefully and collaboratively and closely to align our thinking and decision with the Welsh, UK and Northern Irish governments.\n\u201cBut if the evidence and the science tells us that because we are all at different stages of the infection curve we might need to do things slightly differently, it would be astounding for any first minister to say that they would simply ignore that.\u201d\nListing occasions so far where the UK-wide approach has included a slightly different approach for Scotland, she said: \u201cWe banned mass gatherings slightly earlier, we announced the closer of schools slightly earlier, the lockdown came at the same time for the UK but Scotland was slightly earlier in the infection curve at that point, and we\u2019ve taken a slightly tougher line on business closure, construction being an example.\u201d\nShe added that divergence should not be for \u201csilly political considerations\u201d, but guided by science. \u201cWhere the evidence, with judgment applied to it, drives us in slightly different direction, as long as that\u2019s for a good sound reason and not for some silly political consideration that has no place in these discussions, then that is logical and sensible.\u201d",

We will not go to our villages. We will not roast in our yards. We will not go to our churches. And, of course, we will not gather in the homes of relatives and friends,\u201d the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said. \u201cFor us to continue being together, this year we stay apart.\u201d\nIn a country that has so far managed to contain the pandemic, the long weekend is seen as crucial if the chain of transmissions is to be successfully stopped.\nTo date, 105 people have died of the virus in a population of 11 million, where confirmed cases and the number of critically ill, at 2,207 and 69 respectively, are also lower than any other European state.\nGreece was shown to be the continent\u2019s best-performing country in both flattening the curve and slowing down the spread of the virus in a study released this week by the international Bridge Tank thinktank.\nBut government ministers, like officials in other Orthodox countries, also realise they have a fight on their hands.\nTraditionally, Greeks flock to ancestral homes in the countryside, filing into churches and chapels in raucous celebration of the most significant religious event in the Orthodox calendar, one that never passes without firecrackers, spit-roasted lamb, music and dancing.\nAlthough a nation better known for its distain for authority has elected to defer to dictates announced in response to the epidemic, there are signs people may have reached a psychological cut-off point.\nRogue clerics and unrulier Greeks have vowed to mark Easter in spirited fashion \u2013 even if, thanks to social distancing, Good Friday processions, church services and family gatherings are forbidden.\nLast week, signalling revolt, Bishop Nektarios of Corfu openly flouted the restrictions by conducting a service, including the taking of holy communion from a shared chalice, attended by a local mayor and senior municipal councillor on the Ionian island. When a public prosecutor subsequently ordered he be put on trial after pressing charges, his lawyer retorted \u201cthere is no decree prohibiting holy communion\u201d. Clerics, like the bishop, faced a \u201chuge moral dilemma\u201d over what to do, he said.\nNikos Hardalias, the civil protection minister handling the day-to-day response to the pandemic, warned on Thursday that miscreants should not expect leniency. At \u20ac300 per infraction, he said the penalties would be doubled if Greeks were found to be indulging in \u201cpurposeless movement\u201d over the long weekend. Restrictions will be tightened from Saturday evening through to midnight on Monday, with an estimated 5,000 extra police dispatched to patrol the streets of the Greater Athens region of Attica alone.",

However, no timeframe has been set, and the president has reportedly said state governors will decide when and if to put the plans into operation.\nBox-office analysts also remain sceptical. Jeff Bock, senior analyst for data agency Exhibitor Relations, told USA Today: \u201cI shook my head when I saw this \u2026 I don\u2019t know how that happens right now when lives are still at stake.\u201d Bock has previously suggested that cinemas \u201cwill be closed until at least late June, possibly longer. Even then, they won\u2019t be at normal capacity.\u201d\nCinemas in North America shut down almost entirely in mid-March, with only a handful of drive-in venues remaining open, albeit under strict distancing rules. All major releases have been postponed, with audiences turning to streaming platforms during lockdown conditions. Studios have experimented with video-on-demand releases, breaking the traditional window between cinema screening and home entertainment availability, but so far kids animation Trolls World Tour is the only putative blockbuster to have premiered on a streaming format. Its studio, Universal, has not released figures but said the release was a success, with trade publication Deadline suggesting it made $40m-$50m in its first few days.\nThe cinemas themselves are still grappling with the financial fallout from the shutdown, with a report from investment bank Loop Capital, quoted in the New York Post, suggesting that a quarter of the US\u2019s screens will close permanently as a result of the pandemic. The US\u2019s largest chain AMC, which operates over 600 venues, has announced a plan to sell off $500m of debt to try and remain liquid and has furloughed around 25,000 employees. Its majority stakeholder, Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda, has denied speculation the company will seek to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Mooky Greidinger, the CEO of Cineworld, which owns the US\u2019s second largest chain Regal, said in a Q&A with Deadline that he believed \u201cthat towards the end of June, we will be able to open the cinemas and hopefully in early July, we will see the first blockbuster released\u201d. Greidinger also said that \u201cmost\u201d of Regal\u2019s employees had been furloughed, and blamed \u201ca big noise in the media\u201d for protests over its initial plans to terminate its staff in the UK, before the treasury announced its Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The US\u2019s third biggest chain, Cinemark, has revealed it had laid off over 17,000 staff, and was planning to sell $250m of debt.",

        "content": "Uncompromising defender who won two league titles with Leeds United and was a member of England\u2019s 1966 World Cup squad\nThe footballer Norman Hunter, who has died aged 76 after contracting Covid-19, was a hardman with an abrasive style and a formidable left foot. He was an essential element of the Leeds United team that achieved such success and notoriety under the managership of Don Revie in the 1960s and 70s. He was also a member of England\u2019s World Cup winning squad of 1966.\nHis popular nickname was Norman \u201cbites yer legs\u201d Hunter, and the epithet was well deserved. Detailed to perform an uncompromising, committed role at centre-half, he was a crucial element in a Leeds team that for much of its reign was widely disliked as cynical and mean.\nOperating alongside another tough figure in the tall centre-half Jack Charlton, Hunter\u2019s fierce tackling made life easier for the club\u2019s two creative players, Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles, to whom he would feed the ball that he so often won. Revie was given to praising Hunter with such frequency after matches that his oft-repeated remark \u201cWasn\u2019t Norman Hunter marvellous?\u201d turned into something of a comedic catchphrase. As Leeds became more successful, they gradually modulated into a team that could play elegant football, but Hunter rarely stooped to such frivolity.\nStories of his misdemeanours were legion, and he told many of them himself in later years. Even as a player in times when hard tackling was the norm and sendings-off were a rarity, Hunter admitted that the Football Association had \u201ca fairly thick file\u201d on him at its headquarters in Lancaster Gate. Once, notoriously, in a match between Leeds and Derby County in 1975, he came to blows with his England teammate Francis Lee and both were dismissed after the argument turned into a spectacular and prolonged fist fight. He also entertained a long-running feud with the Chelsea striker Peter Osgood, whose sideburns he was given to grabbing and pulling.\n\u201cYou never intentionally went out to hurt anyone, but the will to win became so strong that you\u2019d get wound up \u2013 and the red mist would come down sometimes,\u201d he once said. \u201cOf course, you\u2019d always pick the player up and say \u2018I\u2019m very sorry about that, ref.\u2019\u201d\nBorn in Gateshead, Norman was brought up by his mother, Betty, and two football-playing uncles; his father, also Norman, died before his birth. But it was Leeds, not his local team Newcastle United, who took him on straight from school. A lightweight in his early years, he was eventually built up by Revie\u2019s trusted daily concoction of sherry and raw egg, and if he was never a stylish footballer, his highly dependable presence in defence did much to help the club achieve glory.\nWith Leeds he won the First Division Championship (in 1969 and 1974), an FA Cup winners\u2019 medal in 1972, the League Cup (1968) and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1968 and 1971). Yet the team were frequently bridesmaid rather than bride, five-times second in the First Division and three times in the FA Cup. Twice, in European competition, they were also runners-up, though each time denied by dubious refereeing. In 1973, in Salonika, when they lost to Milan in the final of the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, Hunter was sent off by Christos Michas, a Greek referee, who later received a life ban for match\u2011fixing. Two years later Leeds again suffered from suspect refereeing in the European Cup final against Bayern Munich, in which Hunter also played. Between those two disappointments, in 1974, Hunter was voted the first ever player of the year by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association.\nHe won the first of his 28 England caps, plus three more, in the 1965\u201166 season, and was picked for the England squad for the 1966 finals, although he did not play in any of the matches. His international career was always and inevitably overshadowed by another, more cultured, No 6 \u2013 Bobby Moore \u2013 and came to a halt at Wembley in 1973 after an uncharacteristically ill-starred World Cup qualifying match against Poland, when he allowed the clever winger Grzegorz Lato to glide past him and set up a goal for Jan Domarski, which would eventually restrict England to a 1-1 draw and eliminate them from the competition.\nIn 1976 he left Leeds after 14 years and more than 500 league appearances, moving to newly promoted Bristol City, where he stayed for three years. He then joined Third Division Barnsley, where his former Leeds teammate Allan Clarke was the manager. He made 31 league appearances for Barnsley, moving up from his coaching role to become manager when Clarke took the job at Leeds in 1980. He raised the team to the Second Division and stayed in the post until 1984, when he was dismissed after a run of six games without a victory, complaining that football was \u201ca sneaky business\u201d.\nGiles, another former Leeds teammate, promptly gave Hunter a coaching job at West Bromwich Albion, but travelling to and from the Midlands was wearying, and he returned to Yorkshire to manage Rotherham in 1985. There he stayed until 1987, when he was dismissed after a humbling 4-0 FA Cup defeat to non-league Macclesfield.\nTwo more appointments in Yorkshire followed: first in 1988 as a coach at Leeds, where he was sacked by the manager Howard Wilkinson a year later, then as assistant manager at Bradford City under another ex-Leeds player, Terry Yorath, who also dismissed him in 1990. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to doing something outside football,\u201d he said ruefully afterwards, and settled down to after-dinner speaking, a small property business and some ghosted journalism.\nWorld Cup squad members in 1966 did not receive winners\u2019 medals but, following a campaign by the FA many years later, Hunter was presented with a World Cup medal at Downing Street in 2009.\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, son, Michael, daughter, Claire, and grandsons, Sam, Max and Ted.\n Norman Hunter, footballer, born 29 October 1943; died 17 April 2020",

We\u2019re tempted to go down to Westminster Bridge and stand gormlessly within two metres of as many people as possible, in accordance with new social distancing guidelines. But that would involve getting dressed, so we\u2019ll probably stick to the usual routine of booze and football. Smarter readers may note that the lockdown hasn\u2019t had much impact on The Fiver\u2019s life. The only differences are that the football is old rather than LIVE!, and we\u2019ve had to scale down from Premium to Value Tin. It\u2019s a subtle palate cleanser: moreishly vile, with notes of Bonjela, turps, bleach and desperation, but at least we can afford it.\nAnd it goes very well with wall-to-wall association football. There\u2019s a bumper weekend of retro entertainment ahead, including the original Super Sunday and the greatest of all Super Sundays. On Saturday afternoon, BBC1 are showing highlights of the astonishing 1990 FA Cup semi-finals. If you don\u2019t want to know the scores, WELL YOU SHOULD BLOODY WELL KNOW THEM! IT\u2019S THE FIRST THING THEY TEACH ON THE FOOTBALL HISTORY SYLLABUS, YOU DISRESPECTFUL OIK!

The phrase \u201cSuper Sunday\u201d became part of the football lexicon two years later, when it fell out of Richard Keys\u2019 abundant mouth before Sky\u2019s first televised Premier League game. On Sunday afternoon they are repeating Nottingham Forest 1-0 Liverpool in its entirety, though sadly they have stopped short of replaying the full five-hour broadcast: two hours of build-up and another hour after the game. Sky are also repeating a documentary about Arsenal\u2019s Invincible season on Sunday night. Just before that, BT Sport have highlights of Arsenal\u2019s swaggering victories over Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen in 2001-02, and the hammering of Internazionale two seasons later. Look, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they went on to win Big Cup in those seasons. Don\u2019t be a buzzkill. Just live in the moment almost 20 years ago!\nFinally, and yes we know it\u2019s not football but our cricketing cousin, The Spin, keeps badgering us to mention it, BT are showing the magnificent Forged In Fire from 9pm on Sunday.

Cohen began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021.\nHe will remain under quarantine for 14 days before he is released. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus.\nAfter he is released, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home, according to multiple US media reports citing Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Roger Adler.\nCohen\u2019s release comes as prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the justice department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6ft (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.\nThe attorney general, William Barr, ordered the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) earlier this month to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hotspots. Otisville is not one of those facilities.\nAs of Thursday, 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the US. Eighteen inmates have died since late March.\nMany federal inmates have been seeking home confinement as the number of coronavirus cases grows in the federal prison system, but advocates have accused the Bureau of Prisons of moving too slowly to release inmates. The Bureau of Prisons said it had moved more than 1,000 inmates to home confinement since 26 March, when Barr first issued a directive to increase its use in late March. The agency said it was a \u201ctremendous logistical lift that was accomplished through the marshaling of all of BOP\u2019s resources\u201d.\nA federal judge had denied Cohen\u2019s attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison and said in a ruling earlier this month that it \u201cappears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle\u201d. But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order.\nOther high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars. Last week, a judge ordered Michael Avenatti \u2013 the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump \u2013 to be temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and stay at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles.\nAvenatti had said he was at high risk of getting the coronavirus because he had recently had pneumonia and his cellmate at the Metropolitan correctional center in Manhattan was removed due to flu-like symptoms.\nThe former New York state senate leader Dean Skelos, 72, who was also serving a sentence at Otisville, is also expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus, prosecutors told a judge on Wednesday.\nCNN first reported Cohen was being released to home confinement.\nA spokesman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

The international benchmark oil price fell to $28 a barrel.\n\u201cThe market knows that the US crude stocks will fill very rapidly,\u201d said Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. Tonhaugen said US crude oil stocks might reach an all time high by the end of the month and continue to build in May.\nRystad Energy expects the US shale industry to shrink by 2.1m barrels a day, or 2% of global supplies, compared with forecasts for the industry before the coronavirus outbreak.\nUS shale was expected to grow by 650,000 barrels a day this year before the coronavirus outbreak wiped out forecasts for global oil demand, triggering one of the steepest oil price declines on record. It is now forecast to shrink by 1.5m barrels a day compared to last year and that may accelerate even further.\nOne of the largest US oil companies, ConocoPhillips, plans to slash its North American oil production by 225,000 barrels of oil a day and cut its planned spending by more than a quarter to $4.3bn.\nThe US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron have also set out plans to rein in oil production and spending as US oil projects take the brunt of a sharp decline in global oil demand. Exxon will cut its planned spending by 30% or $10bn this year, while Chevron will cut its spending by a fifth, or $4bn, compared with last year.\nMany smaller oil producers also began shutting their wells earlier this month as excess oil supplies threatened to overwhelm storage facilities. The glut of oil has led to negative oil prices in some inland areas of the US because the cost of transporting oil to refineries or ports is higher than the market price per barrel.\nThe Guardian reported last month that global oil prices may fall to lows of $10 a barrel as the world runs out of space to store its oil. The global oil industry may increasingly look to offshore oil tankers to store its extra crude oil, but for this to be economic it would require oil prices to fall further.",

He\u2019s been around a long time, he knows everything and it\u2019s wonderful that everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a one-man fundraising machine and God knows what the final total will be.

He has now released a cover version of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone with the West End star Michael Ball to raise more money for NHS Charities Together.\nBall said he hoped the single, which also features the NHS Voices of Care choir, would reach No 1 in time for Moore\u2019s 100th birthday on 30 April.

Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could give him a No 1 record for his 100th birthday?\u201d\nMoore said: \u201cI never in my wildest dreams imagined I would be releasing a single with Michael Ball OBE, but I also never thought it possible for me to walk in the garden and raise millions. So, why not sing, spread some cheer and again \u2013 raise money for our national heroes. NHS, this one is for you!\u201d\nOn Thursday, as he finished his 100th lap, Moore said it was \u201can absolutely fantastic sum of money\u201d, adding he would be doing less walking on Friday.\nThe Duchess of Cornwall has also written to the veteran.\nMoore had initially set himself a fundraising target of \u00a31,000 by walking the length of his garden at his Bedfordshire home.\nOriginally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, he trained as a civil engineer before enlisting in the army for the second world war, rising to the rank of captain and serving in India and Burma.\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman told a Westminster briefing: \u201cFrom his military contributions to his support for NHS staff, Tom has demonstrated a lifetime of bravery and compassion.

        "content": "TV and news website audiences are sky-high but, with few ads or new shows, future looks fraught\nFrom TV channels running out of shows, to newspapers facing the threat of closure, the British media industry is facing a financial shock that will permanently reshape how we consume news and entertainment.\nMedia analysts and insiders warn the pandemic will have a long-lasting impact on the country\u2019s cultural life, predicting that changes in consumer behaviour expected to take more than five years may have happened in five weeks, with many people unlikely to entirely return to their pre-lockdown habits.\nTelevision audiences are up \u2013 but channels risk running out of showsAudiences for traditional TV channels have rocketed as Britons are stuck at home, with viewing levels higher than at Christmas time. One unexpected side-effect of the pandemic has been the enormous increase in viewing among teenagers, potentially signalling the return of families watching TV together.\nThe problem for commercial channels is that there are very few advertisements to show to these enlarged audiences, as companies cut their marketing budgets ahead of the impending recession. One insider at a commercial channel said British TV advertising is down 40% for the three months between March and June.\n\u201cThe way the media market works is on supply and demand,\u201d said Stephen Allan, chief executive of the major media buying agency MediaCom, referring to the enlarged audiences available to advertisers and the fall in the number of companies wanting to buy adverts to reach them. \u201cWhat broadcast media are facing is a perfect storm, where supply has gone up hugely but demand has gone down.\u201d\nHe said that while some of his clients are talking about increasing their advertising spend when the lockdown ends, he fears channels will run out of new programmes to bring in audiences, as no shows have been made during the lockdown.\n\u201cStuff that was being made is not going to be there, in terms of the more typical dramas or sitcoms. So what are they going to show?\u201d\nThese fears are widespread, with popular soaps such as EastEnders and Coronation Street already cutting the number of episodes they screen to try to avoid running out of pre-filmed material.\n\u201cFor at least two years you\u2019re going to see less money on screen,\u201d said Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis, who predicted a severe shortage of scripted dramas. Actors and directors will have committed to filming multiple projects, he said, with schedules that now overlap.\nHe also said that about 40% of the most popular 1,000 shows in the UK are episodes of soaps, which could soon fall off air unless production resumes: \u201cNeighbours is now on twice a week, which completely destroys the point of soaps. The longer they can\u2019t film, [the more likely] they\u2019ll run out of episodes.\u201d\nMeanwhile, ITV sources confirmed reports that filming of Love Island, one of the channel\u2019s main cashcows, has been delayed until August at the earliest, and could even be filmed in the UK rather than on a Spanish island.\nAnd Channel 4 has slashed its programme budget by a quarter to ensure survival, raising fears that the collapse of domestic commissioning budgets will mean less distinctively British television will get made.\nNewspapers face threat of closure as advertisers fleeThe British newspaper industry is facing an existential threat, with the National Union of Journalists warning many papers will close permanently as a result of the pandemic, and thousands of journalists will lose their jobs.\nNewspaper websites are seeing record readership levels but little income, as advertisers have slashed budgets or blocked their promotions from appearing alongside coronavirus-related stories. There are also signs that news audiences are starting to decline as people get used to the lockdown.\nFree websites are often cross-subsidised by print sales, but the model is being hit hard. Although there has been an increase in people using services such as Deliver My Newspaper, national newspaper sales are down by about a fifth, with staff at News UK asked to tweet urging people to buy a paper in an attempt to drive up sales.\nPrint advertising revenue has collapsed, down by about 80% since the start of the pandemic. The situation at local newspapers, which rely on small local businesses for ads, and were struggling even before the crisis, is worse. Almost every major British publisher, including the Guardian, has furloughed some staff in an attempt to weather the storm.\nStreaming and gaming look to fill the gapNetflix has been among the biggest winners, with its soaring share price meaning the company is now worth more than the oil multinational ExxonMobil. However, it is facing its own issues, with production of hit shows such as Sex Education paused owing to the pandemic. YouTube has also enjoyed enormous viewership, but its creators have suffered falls in ad revenue, which is also likely to dent profits at Facebook and Google.\nSky and BT Sport have been badly affected by the absence of sport, with many people pausing or cancelling their subscriptions \u2013 but there are growth areas. Viewers have turned to gaming, with popular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch sold out in many stores.\nCinema releases have been upendedThe global film release schedule has been upended by the pandemic, with cinemas closed for the foreseeable future and films stacking up as they miss their release dates.\nThe UK cinema industry is likely to lose \u00a3400m in ticket sales as 52 million cinema-goers stay at home, based on equivalent figures from 2019. Industry chiefs hope audiences will return to see delayed blockbusters such as Wonder Woman 1984, the latest James Bond, No Time to Die, and Mulan. However even when the lockdown is lifted, consumers might take a while to be comfortable squeezing into cinema seats next to strangers.\nSome films are opting to go down the modern equivalent of the direct-to-video route, with Trolls World Tour, a children\u2019s film, made available on streaming services after its cinema release was cancelled. Other films, such as Keira Knightley\u2019s Misbehaviour, which was released in cinemas just days before the lockdown, have been rush-released for download.\nThe BBC hopes it has saved itselfAt the start of the year the BBC was under attack from all sides, and the licence fee could yet be decriminalised. But after attracting plaudits from ministers for its role in a crisis, and with its stable source of funding not affected by the advertising collapse, it has a chance to prove its value.",

You quote guidance from the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology which states that \u201cwomen who are less than 28 weeks pregnant can continue in non-Covid patient-facing roles if necessary precautions are taken\u201d. You omit to say that the RCOG strongly emphasises that the choice to continue working in any patient-facing role rests with the woman and that this choice should be respected by employers. If women are being coerced into working, the failure is with the trusts and health boards, not the RCOG guidance.\nDespite this tragic death, there is no evidence that women below 28 weeks gestation are at increased risk of infection and death. The current guidance from the RCOG allows pregnant women the choice to work or not. To introduce a blanket ban on pregnant women working in patient-facing roles would be a decision based on fear and emotion, not rationality.\nI am a consultant in emergency medicine and I am 25 weeks pregnant.

        "content": "Pharmaceutical company says it can produce tests in the high tens of millions by June\nThe pharmaceutical giant Roche has devised a new coronavirus antibody test, which it is aiming to launch in the UK next month.\nAntibody testing, which has already been utilised in Germany, South Korea and Finland, is seen as a way for countries to exit lockdown by showing who has already had Covid-19 and could therefore have a degree of immunity.\nRoche, which has its headquarters in Switzerland, says it will be able to produce its tests in the order of the high tens of millions by June and will then scale up production \u201cas fast as possible\u201d.\nGeoff Twist, managing director of Roche Diagnostics UK and Ireland, said: \u201cRoche Diagnostics has been working around the clock to develop a high-quality antibody test. We are now collaborating with public health bodies to validate the new antibody test and our aim is to commence a phased rollout across the UK from mid-May.\n\u201cMore than ever it is critical that industry works collaboratively with the NHS to help alleviate pressures and provide solutions \u2013 and once again this has enabled us to move extremely quickly.\u201d\nThe UK government has previously cited antibody tests as a possible route to relaxing restrictions on movement and social distancing but has yet to identify any that are sufficiently accurate. It ordered 3.5m last month but they proved to be unusable because they were unreliable.\nExperts at Oxford University leading the UK\u2019s testing effort say the best ones spotted immune cells only 70% of the time, whereas accuracy would have to be nearer 95% for them to pass muster.\nLast month, Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home-testing kits would be available within days, only for the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, to quash the idea hours later, citing concerns about accuracy.\nAnnouncing its plans on Friday, Roche did not specify the accuracy of its Elecsys serology test but a spokesperson said it was \u201ccomfortable with the high performance data that we are seeing and will share the specifics closer to the time of launch\u201d.\nIt said it would be available to countries accepting the CE mark, which signifies that products sold in the European Economic Area meet the requisite standards, and it is also working with the US Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorisation.\nRoche joins US-based Abbott Laboratories and Becton Dickinson and Co alongside Italy\u2019s DiaSorin in a race to produce an antibody test for coronavirus that is sufficiently accurate. The clamour for such a test has grown despite the fact that, because it is a new virus, no one knows how long immunity will last.\nIf the test is sufficiently accurate, it is likely it will be rolled out to frontline healthcare workers first, to enable them to return quicker from isolation, assess their suitability for working in high-risk environments and their need for personal protective equipment, which has been in short supply. Testing could then be extended to other key workers and potentially the wider population.\nSimon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThis is a very interesting and potentially important advance \u2026 but I think the authorities in the UK would be wise to conduct independent evaluation, given how they\u2019ve had their fingers burned with other tests that they\u2019ve purchased.\n\u201cMoreover, this test will require space and manpower in testing laboratories in addition to equipment already made by the manufacturer. It remains unclear how quickly laboratories that do not already have that particular instrument would be able to obtain them and at what cost.\u201d",

As a result those ministers then made fundamental mistakes, which meant we lost valuable time to prepare for the epidemic, in particular by locking down the country much earlier.\nTo make matters worse, the decision announced on 12 March to abandon community testing and tracing, almost certainly because we no longer had sufficient capacity to do it, has undoubtedly cost a huge number of lives in the UK. Nearly 14,000 have died so far, compared with under 4,000 in Germany \u2013 a larger country than us, but one that never stopped testing and tracing.\nThe reality now is that we don\u2019t even know who all the people are who are advising the government, let alone what advice they are giving. That advice needs to be published so that all of us, and especially parliament, can interrogate it to ensure that it is robust and that important factors have not been overlooked.\nLobby journalists have done their best, but we have to hope that the return of parliament will mean that the government and its advisers are made to be a good deal more accountable than they are required to be in their daily press briefings.Chris DunneLondon\n The suggestion that we should repeatedly flip-flop between lockdown and relaxation (Coronavirus distancing may need to continue until 2022, say experts, 14 April) is dangerous nonsense. Denmark and Greece, among others, have shown what must be done. Lock down fast, hard, long, and once and for all. Wait until new coronavirus cases have fallen to a trickle. Only then let everyone go back to work and socialise, when there is very little virus left to spread. With the economy finally back to firing on all cylinders, keep the virus in check with rigorous testing, tracking, isolation and border control. Our government failed its first test. Its second test will be to resist pressures to lift lockdown too early.David AllenKinoulton, Nottinghamshire\n This government is obsessed with drawing parallels between Covid-19 and the second world war. Odd, therefore, that ministers can\u2019t see that in claiming it\u2019s too early for an exit strategy, they are aligning with those short-sighted strategists who said the Beveridge report on rebuilding and improving health and social services would be a distraction. It wasn\u2019t. It was an inspiration.Dr Colin J SmithWest Kirby, Wirral\n In 1945, the allied powers showed they could contemplate the future even during the darkest days of the war. Less than one month after the last V2 landed in Orpington, Kent, delegates from 50 nations had already arrived in San Francisco to agree the organisation of the new United Nations.

        "content": "Steve Rotheram says covering face would make people more aware of coronavirus situation\nSteve Rotheram is the latest mayor to urge people to wear masks in public after Sadiq Khan called on the government to make them compulsory on transport in London during the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe metro mayor of Liverpool city region said wearing any type of face covering meant Britons were likely to \u201cgo further in protecting [themselves] and other people\u201d.\nRotheram added: \u201cI support Sadiq. I\u2019ve spoken with him on a number of occasions. Sometimes, because we are slightly behind London [in terms of the infection rate], Sadiq\u2019s thinking is ahead of the rest of the country.\n\u201cDoes it 100% protect anybody else? No. But I think if you\u2019ve got a mask on you\u2019re much more aware of your circumstances so I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\nOn Friday morning, the mayor of London said evidence around the world suggested face masks were effective in curbing the spread of the virus, despite UK public health experts not yet recommending the use of the coverings.\nHe was later backed by Sir Keir Starmer, who said it was inevitable the government would have to start advising people to wear masks.\nThe Labour leader said: \u201cAcross Europe I think the advice is changing on face masks. I would like to talk to the government on that, because I don\u2019t want to set up rival strategies or rival theories going forward. But it would be sensible.\u201d\nIt follows U-turns on guidance around the world, including in New York, where the use of face masks in public where physical distancing is not possible was made compulsory on Wednesday.\nSimilar schemes are being operated in a number of French cities, as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nUK government guidance advises people to stay 2 metres apart from anyone outside their household when in public, but does not mention the use of masks.\nKhan said face masks should not be considered a substitute for physical distancing, but as a protective measure in instances where it was difficult to follow the guidelines \u2013 such as in shops or on public transport.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m lobbying for is for when it comes to those circumstances where it\u2019s just not possible to keep your public distance, think of public transport, think of a shop, for people to wear a non-medical facial covering,\u201d he told Sky News.\nKhan added that people should not buy surgical masks, but wear face coverings including bandanas, scarves or reusable masks.\nHis comments came as it was announced bus travel in the capital will in effect be free from Monday, when passengers will all start boarding through the middle door. They will not be required to \u201ctap in\u201d to pay, with most buses having only Oyster or contactless card readers at the front beside the driver.\nTransport for London said a trial of the scheme on 140 buses had demonstrated the move could allow sufficient social distancing on buses, with numbers having dropped dramatically during the coronavirus lockdown. Passenger journeys on buses are down 85% in the capital.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has said medical masks should be prioritised for health workers rather than the general public, although they can be useful in preventing the spread of the virus for those who have Covid-19 symptoms.\nThe WHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro has suggested that the widespread use of masks will become \u201cthe norm\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak.\nShaun Bailey, the Conservative mayoral candidate for London in next year\u2019s election, criticised Khan over the comments, accusing him of not using his powers to protect Transport for London staff.\n\u201cThe mayor knows as well as anyone that nothing is stopping him from providing PPE [personal protective equipment] to every London transport worker if he wanted to,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cStop picking fights with the government to score political points. You\u2019re the mayor. It\u2019s time to take responsibility and act.\u201d\nBailey told the BBC he had sourced 600,000 face masks and vinyl gloves, which could protect every London bus worker for 30 days.\nA spokesperson for the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, said a similar scheme would not be considered for the region because it did not have a problem with busy transport services.\n\u201cI think up here people have done a very good job of keeping safe public distances. There\u2019s not really a major need for [face masks],\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the priority was to ensure health workers had access to PPE.\nFigures published by the Department of Health and Social Care on Thursday showed that 13,729 people had died in UK hospitals after contracting coronavirus. Across the country, 103,093 people have tested positive for the disease.\nThe capital remains the centre of the outbreak, accounting for 3,377 of the total deaths so far.\nThe government has been repeatedly criticised in recent days over its lack of a plan to exit the lockdown, as well as the shortage of PPE \u2013 including masks \u2013 available to frontline workers.\nWhen announcing on Wednesday that lockdown measures in Germany would be gradually eased, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, recommended the public use of masks in shops and on public transport.",

He added they had told customers: \u201cIf you don\u2019t start calming the fever we won\u2019t get to the next crop.\u201d\nPariotti said UK shoppers had bought 30% more tinned tomatoes than usual \u2013 compared with an average 15% more in other countries. \u201cUK consumers have to understand that if they don\u2019t go mad with stocking up for their households then products will always be on the shelves,\u201d he said.\nMcDiarmid said: \u201cIt\u2019s a seasonal crop. It\u2019s finite. What was picked last year is what was picked and that\u2019s all there is until 2020 harvest. We can\u2019t bring forward the harvest.\u201d\nHe said Napolina\u2019s processing plant in Puglia, Italy, had sent out 72 full trucks on one day alone last month, about four times the normal level, as it tried to keep up with demand from stockpiling families.\nWhile demand has since slowed, McDiarmid said staff in Italy had been doing a \u201cHerculean job\u201d trying to meet demand under strict physical distancing rules.\nDifficulties have emerged as the surge in demand has come after two years of poor harvests. Last year, Italian crops were down 20% because of cold and wet weather. Strict physical distancing rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus have also slowed processing in Italy.\nTransporting product to the UK has also been more difficult and expensive as suppliers have had to combine sea, rail and road transport to meet demand and deal with hold-ups at border crossings and difficulties in keeping drivers safe.\nSupermarkets said they were confident supplies would not run out because they were turning to alternative brands and own-label products. But they confirmed there was competition over access to product between different chains.\nAs prices are usually set in June for the year ahead, the price of tomatoes has not gone up but suppliers\u2019 profit margins have been squeezed by additional costs and it is likely that prices will rise for the year ahead.",

Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager\u2019s plans.\nIt is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team\u2019s first League Cup, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville\u2019s England squad.\nSpence admits \u201cthe squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there\u2019s so many good midfielders in England. It\u2019s tough\u201d. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd.\n\u201cPhil\u2019s not spoken to me once,\u201d says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. \u201cTo not be given that chance makes me question: \u2018Is it because of what happened?\u2019 I think it is because of what happened, if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d\nSpence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate Eni Aluko spoke to the Guardian about her treatment after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested. Initially Spence stayed quiet before writing to the FA to confirm Aluko\u2019s account of the event.\nAfter a very public and messy series of investigations, the FA \u201csincerely apologised\u201d to both Spence and Aluko. The latter did not play for England again, but with more than 100 caps and the end of her career a bit closer she was aware she had less to lose by speaking out.\nSpence, who was 25 and had attended only one England camp, under Sampson, stayed quiet in an attempt to protect her position. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t speak out straight away was because I was worried,\u201d she says. \u201cI was stressed at the time. There was a lot going on behind closed doors. My main concern was whether it would affect me playing for my country. I\u2019m happy with the decision I took \u2013 I didn\u2019t speak out then, it wouldn\u2019t have been right.\u201d\nShe has had one call-up since, for the squad\u2019s training camp in La Manga in the immediate aftermath under the interim manager Mo Marley, but she is a little sceptical of the intent behind her selection, speculating over whether it was to make the FA \u201clook good in the media\u201d. The FA said in a statement on Friday that \u201cplayers are only ever picked on merit and all English players in the WSL are watched and considered for selection\u201d.\nReflecting on the situation triggers a little frustration, but for now Spence is relaxed about her international future. Why? Because at Chelsea she has Hayes\u2019s trust and feels valued. \u201cRight now I\u2019m not losing any sleep over it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good career at Chelsea, we\u2019re winning titles, we\u2019re challenging every season, so I\u2019m happy with my status at the moment.\u201d\nHer life at Chelsea is by no means a walk in the park. Staying in Hayes\u2019s plans is tough. She had eight league starts this season \u2013 she started 15 games in 2018-19 \u2013 before it was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery year, I\u2019ve got to push myself. I know there\u2019s going to be signings coming in every year.\n\u201cEmma\u2019s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level. It\u2019s just really believing in myself, making sure I\u2019m doing everything right in training every day and competing with the players that come in.\u201d\nHayes\u2019s \u201chonesty\u201d in telling her where she needs to improve, and her willingness to adapt and take it on board, is the secret to her longevity at the club. \u201cEmma can rely on me to be put in wherever she\u2019s needed me,\u201d Spence says. \u201cI\u2019ve played higher and lower. I\u2019ve even played out wide sometimes, which is definitely not my game. Emma always wants a player that can play in different positions so she makes you adapt.\u201d\nHayes prides herself on building teams of leaders, of finding the \u201cright players\u201d, and that approach has yielded trophies. Before the season was suspended, Chelsea were one point behind Manchester City with a game in hand and a domestic treble in their sights having lifted the League Cup in February.\nThe desire for the missing piece, that elusive Champions League, is huge, says Spence: \u201cWe were so unlucky last year not to make the final [Chelsea lost 3-2 on aggregate in the semi-finals to Lyon]. Some people say that you make your own luck but we should\u2019ve made the final with the chances that we created.\n\u201cObviously, not being in the Champions League this year was even more frustrating. If we don\u2019t win it in the next two years I feel like it\u2019ll be a massive failure to be honest, because the team we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that.\u201d",

        "content": "Government bodies, industry and charities to collaborate in research efforts\nThe government has announced a new vaccines taskforce to help the development of a vaccine for Covid-19 and ensure its rapid production and rollout if one arrives.\nThe business secretary, Alok Sharma, also gave details of cash grants for work into both vaccines and potential treatments. Among the projects receiving cash is one led by Public Health England (PHE), which hopes to develop an antibody drug, something that has the potential to work as both a prophylactic and a treatment for those infected.\nA potential antibody drug could be given as a regular infusion to healthcare workers and other high-risk groups, and would provide protection perhaps over a few weeks or months. It could also be used as a treatment to help people fight off the virus when infected.\nSharma\u2019s announcement, at the daily Downing Street press briefing, focused mainly on the idea of the vaccines taskforce, combining government and industry, which would both coordinate research efforts to develop a vaccine and then seek to ensure it could be provided to people as soon as possible.\nLed by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, the taskforce will also include representatives from the drugs firm AstraZeneca and the Wellcome Trust medical foundation.\n\u201cUK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people\u2019s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts,\u201d Sharma said.\n\u201cThe vaccine taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe taskforce will have the brief of first helping provide research groups and industry with support and resources to help develop a vaccine, and then when one arises, to boost manufacturing, if needed reviewing regulations to ensure it can be provided widely and at speed.\nThe consensus among pandemic experts is that the mass use of a reliable vaccine against coronavirus is likely to be the only way governments around the world can fully ease distancing measures.\nWork is taking place in numerous countries, with some human trials already starting. Vallance has maintained that a year to 18 months is a \u201creasonable\u201d timeframe for a vaccine to be widely available.\nSome teams are aiming to move faster than this. Prof Adrian Hill, director of the University of Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute, whose vaccine candidate is expected to enter human trials this month, said the team hoped to be able to confirm efficacy by September and is already scaling up manufacturing. \u201cThe aim is to have at least a million doses [available] by around about September and move even faster from there,\u201d he said.\nThe government has already announced \u00a3250m in funding towards worldwide efforts to develop a vaccine, with \u00a310.5m allocated to six projects in March. On Friday, another \u00a314m was allocated to 21 new projects, based on both vaccines and treatments.\nAmong these is funding for the possible new antibody drug, being developed by PHE, billed as intended to \u201coffer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus\u201d.\nA \u00a33.2m grant will go to a study called Virus Watch, conducted by University College London, that will test 10,000 participants every time they report any symptoms that could be linked to Covid-19 and trace participants\u2019 movements using mobile apps. Other research funded will look at the impact of Covid-19 on pregnancy outcomes and track the rates of infection, through antibody tests, in children and teenagers, who have made up only a tiny fraction of confirmed cases.\nThere has been considerable focus on drugs usually used to treat malaria as a possible way to alleviate coronavirus symptoms. Some of the grant money will go to a clinical trial led by Oxford University in which more than 3,000 patients over the age of 65 presenting at GP surgeries will be given the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to see whether it reduces the need for them to go to hospital or speeds up recovery.\nHydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.\nA widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days has led to it being touted in some quarters as a potential cure for Covid-19. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.\nHowever, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigour to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea. US president Donald Trump has claimed he takes hydroxychloroquine despite FDA warnings.\nHere is a guide to the scientific studies into hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus carried out so far.\nRegardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not. The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.\nOliver Milman\nVallance said the taskforce would \u201censure that any potential coronavirus vaccine, when available, can be produced quickly and at scale so it can be made available to the public as quickly as possible\u201d.",

That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take into account the people who have died in other settings.\nThe European commission says 98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak.\nThe figures reveal the UK government has made sparing use of the EU programme to repatriate citizens, under which the bloc funds 75% of the cost of emergency flights.\nThe number of people in the south-Asia region known to have been infected passes the 22,000 mark. Health officials warn the region, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population, could be the new frontline against the disease because there are millions in densely populated areas and living under fragile public health systems.\nDeaths in Italy rise by 575, up from 525 the day before, while the number of new cases declines slightly to 3,493 from a previous 3,786. The daily death toll is down considerably from peaks reached around the end of March.\nHealth bosses in England are preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating patients, as hospitals are set to run out of supplies within hours.\nThe UK\u2019s newly created vaccine taskforce will be asked to provide industry and research institutions with resources, review regulations and make preparations for large-scale production once a vaccine is developed. It will be led by the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the deputy chief medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam.\nThe government announces \u00a313m in funding for 21 virus research projects; including efforts aimed at treating the disease and at preventing it.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, says the scheme under which the UK government subsidises 80% of furloughed workers\u2019 wages up to \u00a32,500 per month is to be extended to the end of June.\nSunak originally announced the scheme would run for a period of three months, until the end of May. Now it will be extended for a fourth month in the light of the decision yesterday to extend the lockdown for at least three more weeks.\nThe reproduction number of the Covid-19 virus sinks to a new low in Germany, leading the health minister, Jens Spahn, to say there is enough evidence to declare the lockdown strategy a success.\nThe country\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has accused the incumbent of criminally irresponsible handling of the coronavirus as Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll hit 1,924.",

        "content": "Exclusive: U-turn on original guidelines of full-length waterproof gear for high-risk procedures\nNHS bosses have asked doctors and nurses to work without protective full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies.\nThe guidance is a reversal of Public Health England (PHE) guidelines stipulating that full-length waterproof surgical gowns, designed to stop coronavirus droplets getting into someone\u2019s mouth or nose, should be worn for all high-risk hospital procedures.\nIn a significant U-turn, PHE advised frontline staff to wear a flimsy plastic apron with coveralls when gowns ran out, in a move that doctors and nurses fear may lead to more of them contracting the virus and ultimately putting lives at risk. The PHE announcement on Friday evening came shortly after the planned move was revealed by the Guardian. Meanwhile:\nNearly 15,000 people were confirmed to have died from coronavirus in UK hospitals, with the total rising by 847 on Friday to 14,576. After a peak of 980, fewer than 900 deaths have been recorded in hospitals for six days in a row.\nOnly 21,000 tests were carried out \u2013 some of them duplicates \u2013 putting the government far short of its goal of 100,000 a day by the end of the month.\nThe health secretary said Britain would restart tracing the contacts of people with coronavirus symptoms, having stopped in early March.\nThe government set up a vaccines taskforce to help the development, rapid production and introduction of a vaccine.\nThe government confirmed that 1bn items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were to have been delivered across the UK by this weekend \u2013 but hospitals and care homes continued to suffer shortages, in particular of gowns. More than 50 frontline healthcare workers have died amid fears a lack of PPE is leaving them exposed.\nProf Keith Willett, who has been leading NHS England\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis, helped formulate the new PHE guidance, which is being sent to all 217 trusts in England.\nIt sets out options for what frontline staff should do when they cannot access gowns. They include hospitals that still have gowns lending each other batches of them, wearing coveralls \u2013 one-piece items of personal protective equipment (PPE) that cover the whole body \u2013 and using plastic aprons as alternatives.\nIt confirms that wearing \u201cdisposable, non-fluid-repellent gowns/coveralls with a disposable plastic apron for high-risk settings and aerosol-generating procedures [such as intubation] with forearm washing once gown/coverall is removed\u201d is one of the alternatives staff should deploy once gowns run out.\nIn total, PHE set out three alternatives to using the high-spec fluid-repellent gowns that are now in short supply.\nThe second of those also involves staff using \u201creusable (washable) surgical gowns/coveralls or similar suitable clothing (e.g. long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown, industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for aerosol-generating procedures and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown/coverall is removed\u201d.\nUnder the third option, hospitals should conserve supplies of fluid-repellent gowns by using them only during aerosol-generating procedures and surgery.\nA source had told the Guardian: \u201cThe new guidance will say \u2018this is what you do if you don\u2019t have any gowns\u2019. Wear an apron instead \u2013 that will be the new policy for the foreseeable future, though the medical organisations will go mad about that.\u201d\nGowns are vital for frontline staff dealing with Covid-positive patients because, alongside an FFP3 face mask, visor or goggles and two pairs of gloves, they make up the full PPE which PHE says is necessary to minimise the risk of infection from intubating patients being put on a ventilator.\nAdvising staff to use aprons instead of gowns carries the risk of a major confrontation with staff groups. The Royal College of Nursing last week made clear that nurses should refuse to treat patients if they were not happy that the level of PPE available would protect them properly. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, has also warned that doctors\u2019 lives are being put at risk by stocks of PPE having reached \u201cdangerously low levels\u201d.\nShortages of gowns in hospitals in England are far worse than Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has admitted, hospital bosses claim. \u201cWe are tight on gowns. That is the pressure point at the moment,\u201d Hancock told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee in an evidence session on Friday morning.\nHe said: \u201cWe have another 55,000 gowns arriving today and we\u2019re working on the acquisition internationally of more gowns, but it is a challenge. This follows changing the guidance 10 days ago which increased the advice on the use of gowns but also said that they should be used for sessional use rather than for individual patient use ... And it is a big challenge delivering against that new guidance and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can.\u201d\nHe could not guarantee that every hospital would have the supplies needed to tide it over this weekend.\nHancock had sought to reassure MPs by stressing that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive on Friday. However, those equate to about eight hours\u2019 supply because the NHS is currently using 150,000 gowns a day.\nThere were only \u201cseveral tens of thousands\u201d left in the NHS\u2019s reserve stockpile, sources said on Friday. \u201cGowns have in effect already run out,\u201d one said. \u201cThe situation is so serious that some trusts will run out today and others over the weekend.\u201d\nEd Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned that PHE\u2019s downgrading of the advice on PPE could result in more lives lost. \u201cChanging official guidance on protective equipment from gowns to aprons translates to increased risk to frontline staff, at a time when the death toll from Covid-19 is already rising for frontline workers. This is intolerable,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe health secretary\u2019s repeated reassurances the supply of protective kit for staff was under control now look totally threadbare. Matt Hancock should have been completely candid about the level of personal protective equipment but is now fast losing the public\u2019s confidence as the reality of severe shortages becomes clear.\u201d\nAt least 50 doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and other NHS staff have died from the coronavirus so far, the Guardian has established.\nPHE is braced for a backlash from medical and nursing organisations. However, some senior figures in NHS England were \u201cexasperated\u201d about PHE\u2019s earlier stipulation that staff in high-risk Covid-19 environments should wear full PPE, including a gown, and regarded that as \u201cexcessive\u201d.\nNHS leaders and Hancock have been desperately trying to find a solution to the lack of gowns since the Guardian first highlighted last week an internal memo from NHS bosses warning hospital chiefs that \u201cthere are no immediate stocks of gowns due in the national supply chain over the next few days and we are unsighted on when further deliveries will be made\u201d.\nMore than a week later, they have been forced to draw up the controversial new guidance, which is a tacit admission that shortages are set to continue.\nNHS Providers, which represents trusts, said hospitals would implement the new guidance. \u201cThe supply of clinical gowns is now critical, and it is now clear that some trusts will run out of fully fluid-repellent gowns,\u201d it said.\nSaffron Cordery, the organisation\u2019s deputy chief executive, said: \u201cTrusts and the National Strategic Reserve have very carefully managed the last remaining stock and trusts have helped each other wherever possible. They have used the remaining stock of coveralls as alternatives to gowns and have been deploying their gown stock very carefully.\n\u201cWe understand the new recommendations \u2026 are aligned with World Health Organization guidance on the use of PPE when it is in short supply.\n\u201cTrust leaders will now implement this plan wherever needed and will therefore use the highest possible level of alternative protection equipment such as a fluid-retardant, as opposed to fluid-repellent, gown combined with an apron.\u201d\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said using aprons instead of gowns would increase the risks run by frontline staff. Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the BMA\u2019s consultants committee, said: \u201cThe health and social care secretary admitted he couldn\u2019t guarantee that supplies of gowns wouldn\u2019t run out this weekend, and now this illustrates the dire situation that some doctors and healthcare workers are finding themselves in.\n \u201cIf staff are now told to use aprons in the place of gowns, this directly contravenes the evidence and guidance from both Public Health England and the World Health Organization. Guidance that\u2019s there to help keep healthcare workers and their patients out of harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cToo many healthcare workers have already died. More doctors and their colleagues cannot be expected to put their own lives on the line in a bid to save others, and this new advice means they could be doing just that. It\u2019s not a decision they should have to make.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social care said: \u201cNew clinical advice has been issued today to make sure that if there are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk. This has been reviewed by the Health and Safety Executive, and is in line with WHO and CDC guidance on PPE use in exceptional circumstances.\u201d\nDr Susan Hopkins, the Covid-19 incident director for PHE, said: \u201cThe UK PPE guidance continues to recommend the highest level of protection for health and social care teams treating Covid-19 patients. PPE is currently a precious resource and it is crucial that everyone that needs it has access to the right protective equipment. That is why we have worked with the NHS and [Health and Safety Executive] to suggest ways that they can maximise the resources they have available.\u201d",

Brazil has so far seen three confirmed Covid-19 deaths among its indigenous population.\nSpecialists from the indigenous agency Funai believe 16 isolated groups could live in the Javari valley. Concerns for their safety soared when a former New Tribes missionary was put in charge of Funai\u2019s isolated indigenous department.\nVerli wrote that Tonkin, a North American missionary, had been seen in the reserve and noted \u201cclear indications of an attempt at cultural assimilation\u201d of an isolated group.\nBrazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper said Tonkin was seen last year trying to make contact with an isolated group from the Korubo tribe using a hydroplane and was preparing a new expedition. Tonkin told O Globo the accusation was \u201cgossip\u201d.\nNew Tribes Mission said the group had removed all its missionaries from indigenous reserves by 23 March and \u201cdoes not work with isolated peoples\u201d. Funai said Brazil\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office would analyse the ruling.\n\u201cEvery time that rights are threatened in the Javari valley we will go to court,\u201d said Beto Marubo, an indigenous leader from the reserve.",

        "content": "Semi-autonomous city followed WHO advice and moved swiftly to stem contagion without rigid curbs on movement\nGovernments in Europe and the US can learn from Hong Kong, which has kept infections and deaths from Covid-19 low without resorting to the socially and economically damaging lockdown that the UK and other countries have imposed, scientists say.\nHong Kong, with a population of nearly 7.5 million, had had just 715 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, including 94 asymptomatic infections, and four deaths as of March 31, according to a new study published on Friday in the Lancet.\nEarly in the pandemic, it was thought to be at significant risk because of travellers arriving from mainland China, but since early February the outbreak has appeared to be under control.\nThe semi-autonomous city took the route that the World Health Organization recommends and embarked on a rigorous programme of testing everyone with symptoms. Those who tested positive were quarantined in hospital. All their contacts over recent days were traced and instructed to self-isolate. In early March, about 400 outpatients and 600 inpatients were being tested every day.\nStrict controls were brought in at the borders. Anyone arriving from mainland China or a country with Covid-19 cases was required to go into quarantine for 14 days. Holiday camps and new but unoccupied housing estates were turned into quarantine facilities. Schools were closed and people were encouraged to work from home if they were able to.\nThe UK and other European countries also implemented testing and contact tracing in the early weeks of their own epidemic. But as the numbers grew, testing and tracing was abandoned in favour of strict lockdown measures to keep people in their homes and prevent them mixing.\nBut Hong Kong has not had that sort of lockdown. Although people were not required to stay at home, they chose to change their behaviour, says the paper in the Lancet Public Health journal.\nIn a survey in March, 85% of respondents reported avoiding crowded places, and 99% reported wearing face masks when leaving home, which the authors say is an indication of their concern.\nDuring the Sars outbreak in 2003 that affected Hong Kong severely, causing 299 deaths, 79% of the population wore masks, but only 10% in the swine flu pandemic of 2009.\nThe scientists estimate that the reproductive rate \u2013 the average number of people infected by each person who has the virus \u2013 has remained at one over the eight weeks from the beginning of February when measures were put in place. That means no acceleration of the epidemic.\nProf Benjamin Cowling from the University of Hong Kong, who led the research, said Hong Kong shows how the disease can be kept to a low level without the economic and social damage that European countries and the US are experiencing.\n\u201cBy quickly implementing public health measures, Hong Kong has demonstrated that Covid-19 transmission can be effectively contained without resorting to the highly disruptive complete lockdown adopted by China, the US, and western European countries,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOther governments can learn from the success of Hong Kong. If these measures and population responses can be sustained, while avoiding fatigue among the general population, they could substantially lessen the impact of a local Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d\nThe team of scientists examined whether influenza levels dropped as a result of physical distancing and behaviour change in Hong Kong, as a proxy for Covid-19 transmission in the community.\nThe two diseases are transmitted in similar ways. Flu transmission was reduced by 44% during February after school closures. Schools were also closed during swine flu in 2009, but that led only to a drop of 10-15% in flu transmission.\n\u201cThe speed of decline in influenza activity in 2020 was quicker than in previous years when only school closures were implemented, suggesting that other social distancing measures and avoidance behaviours have had a substantial additional impact on influenza transmission,\u201d said the report\u2019s co-author, Dr Peng Wu, from the University of Hong Kong.\n\u201cAs both influenza and Covid-19 are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics, it\u2019s likely that these control measures have also reduced Covid-19 transmission in the community.\u201d\nShe added that Hong Kong\u2019s population was more aware of the need to change their behaviour because of the experience of past infectious disease outbreaks.\n\u201cTo me this paper is very timely and provides important evidence that should influence our own plans for moving away from lock-down,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.\n\u201cAlthough one cannot always extrapolate from an Asian to a European country, the Hong Kong approach could provide us with a way of easing the severity of the lockdown without risking case numbers increasing again.\u201d\n\u201cAs one of the most heavily affected [areas] during the Saras epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong is better equipped to contend with an outbreak of Covid-19 than many other countries,\u201d she said.\n\u201cImproved testing and hospital capacity to handle novel respiratory pathogens, and a population acutely aware of the need to improve personal hygiene and maintain physical distancing, put them in good stead.\u201d\nCowling was unable to say whether the policy of testing, contact tracing and isolation had been the most important measure. \u201cThat is a really important question and one which we have not yet been able to answer. We think most likely it is a combination of measures that works well. Social distancing slows transmission and prevents large outbreaks, allowing test and trace to keep up,\u201d he said.\nThe extensive contact tracing and quarantine would be the most difficult element to replicate, he said. \u201cIn Hong Kong we have designated facilities for quarantine outside of the home, and also procedures for strict enforcement of home quarantine. Individuals with higher risk of infection (perhaps greater exposure to infection) would be quarantined outside the home, and those with lower risk would be placed in home quarantine for 14 days.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 18 April 2020 to clarify that the Hong Kong case figures were as of 31 March.",

It is under siege!\u201d \u2013 a reference to Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, last week signing into law new measures on gun control.\nTrump has repeatedly ignored his own entreaty to put partisan politics aside during the coronavirus pandemic. His latest provocative interventions followed demonstrations against stay-at-home orders in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and other states that have drawn elements of the far right.\nSome protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. They have been egged on by conservative media hosts such as Fox News\u2019s Jeanine Pirro, who said: \u201cWhat happened in Lansing [Michigan] today, God bless them: it\u2019s going to happen all over the country.\u201d\nAt Friday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, Trump played down fears that by crowding together, the protesters themselves could spread the Covid-19 illness. \u201cThese are people expressing their views,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI see where they are and I see the way they\u2019re working. They seem to be very responsible people to me, but they\u2019ve been treated a little bit rough.\u201d\nIn 2017 the president was condemned for reacting to a deadly clash between white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, by observing that there \u201cwere very fine people on both sides\u201d.\nOn Friday, Trump also stood by his criticism of the Democratic governors, even though they are following his own federal guidelines. \u201cI think some things are too tough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, it\u2019s too tough, not only in reference to this but what they\u2019ve done in Virginia with respect to the second amendment is just a horrible thing ... When you see what other states have done, I think I feel very comfortable.\u201d\nAsked if he believed Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia should lift their stay-at-home orders, the president added: \u201cI think elements of what they\u2019ve done are too much, just too much ... What they\u2019ve done in Virginia is just incredible.\u201d\nTrump, known to watch Fox News closely, has offered mixed messages. On Monday he claimed \u201ctotal\u201d authority to order an end to the stay-at-home measures, but on Thursday issued phased \u201cguidelines\u201d that passed the buck to governors to make decisions on the ground about when and how to reopen. His tweets on Friday appeared to undercut his own experts\u2019 warnings and drew sharp criticism.\nJay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington, tweeted in response: \u201cThe president\u2019s statements this morning encourage illegal and dangerous acts. He is putting millions of people in danger of contracting Covid-19. His unhinged rantings and calls for people to \u2018liberate\u2019 states could also lead to violence. We\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman who like Inslee ran for the Democratic nomination, said: \u201cRepublicans will turn a blind eye [and] too many in the press will focus on \u2018tone\u2019. But history books will say: in April of 2020, when the pandemic had already claimed 35,000 lives, the president of the United States incited people to storm their statehouses with AR-15s and AK-47s.\u201d\nMichigan has taken big hits in both coronavirus cases and job losses and will be a critical battleground state in the presidential election. Wednesday\u2019s \u201cOperation Gridlock\u201d, a demonstration against strict stay-at-home policies ordered by Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, attracted the Proud Boys and other far-right groups who have been present at pro-Trump and gun rights rallies in Michigan.\nMost protesters stayed in their vehicles and circled the state capitol building in Lansing, but a small group stood on the capitol steps to flout physical distancing guidelines. They brandished signs that included \u201cTrump/Pence\u201d, \u201cRecall Whitmer\u201d, \u201cHeil Whitmer\u201d and \u201cStop the Tyranny\u201d, and briefly chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d, echoing Trump campaign rallies\u2019 targeting of Hillary Clinton.\nWhitmer, who dismissed the stunt as \u201cessentially a political rally\u201d, has emerged as a possible running mate for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said at an online \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event Whitmer had \u201cturned this crisis into a platform to run for vice-president\u201d.\nThe protests have earned comparisons with the Tea Party movement of a decade ago and more are expected in coming days, with the tension between public health and economic reopening viewed through an increasingly partisan lens.\nThe Washington Post reported: \u201cUncertainty and fear over the economic impact of stay-at-home orders is fueling a sort of culture war between conservatives, whose political strength now comes from rural America, right now less affected by the virus, and liberals, whose urban strongholds have been most affected by it.\u201d\nLast Saturday, for example, the Republican senator Ted Cruz, a Trump ally, tweeted that he was going to the beach with his children. \u201cFortunately, I live in Texas \u2013 where we protect public safety, but aren\u2019t authoritarian zealots \u2013 so they won\u2019t arrest me!\u201d he wrote.\nAccording to Pew Research, 81% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say their greater concern is that governments will lift restrictions too quickly. About half (51%) of Republicans and Republican leaners say their bigger concern is that state governments will act too quickly.",

We can emerge from this stronger than before if we invest in public services.\n\u201cWe need to shield the most vulnerable, and I don\u2019t just mean the most impoverished,\u201d she said. \u201cThe health crisis has exposed that those doing the most important jobs \u2013 health workers, people who supply us with food, those who care for the old and the very young - are also in the most precarious financial circumstances\u201d\nShe said she believed that when Spanish people step out on to their balconies to applaud those in the front line every evening at eight o\u2019clock, it was a protest as well an act of solidarity and appreciation.\n\u201cPublic health has suffered severe cutbacks, above all in Catalonia and Madrid,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are very conscious of the fact that cuts kill.\u201d\nAn upside of the lockdown is that vastly reduced traffic has meant that cities such as Madrid and Barcelona have finally been able to meet WHO standards on air pollution \u2013 temporarily, at least.\nIn January Barcelona banned old cars with high emissions from entering the city. Colau points out that her government was criticised for damaging the economy but believes the experience of car and pollution-free city has made people more willing to accept traffic restrictions.\n\u201cEverything has come to a stop and it\u2019s a good time to reflect,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have seen that we can live without cars and without them we breathe easier. When this virus has passed, we\u2019re still going to have to deal with climate change. We have this opportunity to open public space to people, to cyclists, and make it a safer and healthier place for everyone.\u201d\nParadoxically, she adds, as long as the public has to maintain social distancing it will be safer to use private cars than public transport. Some community groups are campaigning to have a greater part of the streets given over to pedestrians to aid social distancing.\nColau believes this is the ideal time to rethink the three issues that have dominated public debate in Barcelona in recent years \u2013 massive tourism, pollution and soaring rents.\nThe tourism industry says it has effectively written off 2020 and is looking ahead to next year. Visitors will return, but perhaps not in such great numbers and, starting from zero, the city is in a better position to manage the type and numbers of visitors it receives.\nMuch of the increase in tourism has been driven by Airbnb and similar platforms, which have also been blamed for driving up rents.\n\u201cOwners of tourist apartments have already started looking for long-term tenants, which is good news because we\u2019ve always said homes in the city should be for the people who live here,\u201d the mayor said.\n\u201cWe need to learn from this crisis, because there won\u2019t be a return to normality. There will be a new normality, a chance to do things better, and it\u2019s up to us and no one else.\u201d",

While we\u2019ve been granted injunctions to stay, this is the first time we\u2019ve been able to show that something hasn\u2019t been right. So for Priya, she definitely feels that sense of relief.\u201d\nThe federal court looked at whether the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, considered lifting a bar under the Migration Act in 2017 that prevented Australian-born Tharunicaa applying for a visa and, separately, whether the family had been given procedural fairness in the potential consideration of an application by the immigration minister, David Coleman, in May 2019.\nFredericks said supporters were cautiously optimistic because it may be a chance to put their case to the minister.\n\u201cUltimately we hope that this leads to the lawyers being able to submit all the evidence that Sri Lanka is not safe,\u201d Fredericks said. \u201cSince they put their claims in five years ago there\u2019s never been a chance to put forward any information.\u201d\nFord said while the family lost on the first ground they were successful on the second ground, \u201cthat the applicant was not afforded procedural fairness in that process\u201d.\n\u201cThe applicant was never notified of the August 2019 assessment nor invited to comment on any aspect of the assessment,\u201d Ford said.\n\u201cThe injunction remains in place during this period and she will not be deported. Any deadline to appeal would not be until after the final order is made by the judge.\n\u201cIt also remains open to the minister of home affairs or immigration at any stage to consider releasing the applicant and her family back into the Biloela community.\u201d\nColeman lifted a barrier to allow him to consider a visa application for Tharunicaa last May, but no decision was made.\nThe immigration department then completed an assessment which found the family was unlikely to come under Australia\u2019s protection visa obligations.",

These past weeks have taught me that it\u2019s not such a bad thing to tread and retread the same paths. Every day I look at these same hills, these same shores, and every day they show me something new. Over time, these daily walks build up, one upon the other, to create a long view: a portrait of a place through time.\nA few days ago, for the first time this season, I heard a familiar voice rising above the rest like a flautist. It sang a sliding upwards note which it then repeated, gathering pace, until it hit its rhythmic, rippling peak. I searched the sky for the source: wings outstretched, and that unmistakable bill \u2013 a long and slender curved proboscis \u2013 less hummingbird than hummingbird moth. A curlew, Numenius arquata, announcing his presence at his breeding ground.\nHe had a distinctive flight pattern too, making a laboured, flapping climb before a smooth and effortless gliding descent. Rising and falling, stitching the air over the marshy meadowland near where the Hoy Sound pounds the coast as he searched for a mate.\nAfter a moment, a second voice rose to meet his: revving up just as he had, moving through the gears, escalating to that same bubbling crescendo. A rival, I supposed, but to me they sounded as a well-rehearsed duet, an ode to spring.\nThe following day came the squeeze-toy squall of lapwings, and I spotted their tumbling butterfly flights, flashing white underwings as if showing their bloomers. And from above, piccolo-shrill, the skylark in ascendance, singing his heart out, who rose until he was a black dot in a vibrant sky, then parachuted down.\nA phenologist will build up records over many years: the dates of the arrivals of new migrants, the opening of flowers, the first frogspawn. I find these daily, government-sanctioned ambles across home ground have sharpened me to such minute developments, the inching forward of the season as it takes uneven, tottering steps towards summer.

        "content": "Fresh NHS England guidelines raise safeguarding concerns about end-of-life care\nFamilies will be expected to provide end-of-life care to relatives dying at home during the crisis, according to NHS England guidelines that have raised safeguarding concerns among experts.\nAccording to the new standard operating procedure for community health services, families will be asked if they can provide care that until now has been provided by GPs, community services and specialist palliative care teams.\n\u201cDuring the coronavirus pandemic, there will be more people dying of coronavirus at home who will also require care and support at the end of their lives,\u201d says the guidelines.\n\u201cThe anticipated increase in demand and stretch in workforce availability means that there will have to be a greater reliance on family members, unpaid carers and those who are with these patients, to help provide the care,\u201d it adds. \u201cThey may have to administer medication more than they are used to.\u201d\nTo help manage the health needs of people at the end of life, specialist palliative care advice usually available only to GPs will be made accessible to those caring for loved ones dying at home.\nAdditional information to support family carers is being developed, the guidance says. In the meantime, it provide links to two documents, including a toolkit, which give step-by-step instructions to help those caring for someone dying at home.\nThe documents instruct family members how to insert and use cannulas to inject medication under the skin if the dying person is experiencing pain and other symptoms not controlled by their regular medication.\nStrong pain medications such as opioids, often used to manage pain, will be issued to families. But concern has also been raised about relatives of vulnerable people having to administer high doses of drugs such as morphine without sufficient oversight.\nThere is also concern that enough checks will be made to ensure the opiates are not used by those other than the patient.\n\u201cThe guidance talks about delivering palliative care remotely, but how is that possible?\u201d said Caroline Abrahams of Age UK. \u201cIn a valiant and right attempt to protect NHS staff from contracting the virus, people are being left on their own when they need support.\n\u201cWhere are the safeguarding measures to stop people being bumped off?\u201d she asked. \u201cHelping someone die well is a specialist skill set. Unfortunately, it feels is thought people have been left to get on with it when a reasonable expectation of our society is that we get skilled palliative care.\u201d\nDr Richard Vautrey, the GP committee chair at the British Medical Association, said families had not previously been asked to take on end-of-life care. \u201cBut as we have seen across the health and care system, processes are having to change and adapt in the face of what is an unprecedented situation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOf course, it would only be done when individuals had the ability to do it safely and with supervision \u2013 albeit remotely in most cases. Only family members who are willing and able would be asked to do this \u2013 no one should be compelled to do so.\u201d\nProf Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cWe understand it is a distressing time for people whose loved ones are sick and if appropriate, we will support families and unpaid carers to safely take on elements of an individual\u2019s care, such as administering medicines.\n\u201cCovid-19 is more than an NHS issue \u2013 it will take a nationwide effort to get through this crisis and so far, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous effort from our patient\u2019s families and friends. Where families are not comfortable taking on elements of their loved one\u2019s care, this will be respected.\u201d\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is already common practice for people who are willing and able to help care for family members receiving end-of-life care, supported by expert clinicians and with the right training, and just as is already the case no one will be asked to do things they cannot, or do not wish to, do.\u201d",

        "content": "Being isolated in student accommodation can be distressing, but these expert tips will help you get through this difficult period\nWhen it looked like the UK would go on lockdown, final year student Jia Wei Lee knew she had to stay in her student house in Wales, away from her home country of Malaysia. It was a difficult decision, but with a dissertation to write and a student visa to worry about, Lee decided to isolate in Treforest, where she studies biology and conservation at the University of Wales.\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re a community but we are separated by walls. I realised that I didn\u2019t want to dwell on suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to bring this community closer together \u2013 breaking the virtual barriers between everyone.\u201d\nLee started posting videos on social media to share life hacks \u2013 some useful (like tips for folding clothes in three seconds) and some not so conventionally helpful (how to make a slingshot from a rubber band).\nIt\u2019s one of the ways Lee has learned to cope on lockdown, as just one of thousands of students in the UK who are now isolating in university halls and student accommodation.\nWith around one in seven people experiencing distress associated with lockdown, we asked students and psychologists for their tips on how to get through this difficult period.\nSetting a routine is vital for your wellbeing. Professor Kevin Morgan, sleep expert at Loughborough University, warns that you shouldn\u2019t use sleep \u201cas a counter-product to boredom\u201d. He says it\u2019s critical to get out of bed at a normal time in the morning.\nAlthough all the usual life cues are gone \u2013 like lectures, or meeting friends \u2013 we need to keep the things that synchronise our body clocks, Morgan says, such as meal times, recreation, and winding down in the evening.\nKeeping a routine not only helps with sleep but will keep you motivated, says survival psychologist Dr Sarita Robinson, from the University of Central Lancashire. \u201cPeople in extreme environments can survive and come out mentally intact because they have appropriate coping mechanisms. A structured plan can be really helpful in keeping you motivated, so you don\u2019t just fall away into feeling listless and depressed.\u201d\nBuild studying into your routine. Mike Leaf, a final year geoscience student at Keele University, advises giving yourself deadlines. Setting yourself a goal of finishing a chapter of a project by the weekend, for example, will \u201ckeep you focused without guidance from supervisors.\u201d\nLee says she checks in with friends to keep on task. She calls them her accountability buddies. \u201cWe motivate each other to finish our aims for the day.\u201d\nTry not to put too much pressure on yourself to achieve. This is an unprecedented time, and \u201cit\u2019s absolutely OK to not be OK at the moment,\u201d Robinson says. It\u2019s good to have goals, she adds \u2013 \u201cbut my goals aren\u2019t things like I\u2019m going to write a high-impact journal. My goals are finishing that jigsaw, or spending an hour learning how to dance the Charleston. Low-level goals keep you motivated.\u201d\nSee what support is on offer at your university or students\u2019 union. Robinson says: \u201cIt\u2019s about reassuring students that we\u2019re here for them. There is a lot of support, especially for international students unable to travel home, or students estranged from families.\u201d\nCall your friends and family, and arrange virtual pub quizzes or games. \u201cIf you\u2019re a person who enjoys social contact, then it\u2019s about trying to find a new way to connect,\u201d she adds.\nMorgan says the key is to get outside to exercise. \u201cGet out and do a sensible amount of exercise when the sun is bright. Tell your physiology that it\u2019s daylight. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you can exercise yourself to sleep \u2013 you can\u2019t, but what you can do is relieve some of the stresses that would otherwise accumulate through a confined environment.\u201d\nExercise doesn\u2019t have to be a workout. \u201cIt can mean moderate walking. It can simply mean being outdoors, raising your heart rate at about 50%,\u201d he says.\nLee adds: \u201cWhenever I feel anxious, I make sure to get out of the house and take my one hour of exercise. I can take a breather. It\u2019s about listening to your body.\u201d\nThe mental health benefits from interacting with green space are huge. If you can, go for a walk in a park or garden. But if that\u2019s not possible, bring the garden inside instead. \u201cTry virtual tours,\u201d suggests Robinson. \u201dJust looking at green scenery has been shown to be beneficial. Growing things is also very therapeutic.\u201d\nExtensive research suggests gardening helps reduce anxiety and stress-related symptoms. You can still grow plants if you\u2019re living in one room in block halls. Herbs such as coriander or rosemary are good for windowsills, and you can even get a (free) houseplant after eating an avocado. Fill a glass with water, and put toothpicks in the avocado stone to suspend it on the rim, so the bottom half rests in water. Make sure it has sunlight, and when the stone sprouts, pot some compost and watch it grow.\n\u201cIf you start thinking that you\u2019re stuck in your room, that can be quite demoralising. Rephrase it to \u2018I\u2019m safe in my room, I\u2019ve got opportunities to do things that I can concentrate on,\u2019\u201d Robinson says.\nMany exercise classes, social activities, concerts, and theatre shows are taking place online, so there will always be something to keep you busy. See if your favourite artist or comedian is livestreaming a gig. Or use this time to discover new experiences, whether it\u2019s cooking, gaming, or going to the theatre (virtually). There are resources to help you find these new and mostly free experiences. For example, Cheapskate newsletter, which normally lists affordable things to do in London, is now collating the week\u2019s best free indoor activities, from digital art tours to \u201ce-life drawing\u201d workshops.",

That information is held encrypted and securely on the individual\u2019s mobile phone.\u201d\nThe government wants as many Australians as possible \u2013 more than 40% \u2013 to download the app wanted to assure everyone that there was no \u201chidden agenda\u201d.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cRight now if you test positive to coronavirus, health officials will sit down with you and ask you to trace back where you were and who you have been with,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd it is really hard to try to remember the 90-year-old lady in the queue behind you at a shopping centre, or a family that was close by you for whatever purpose.\u201d\nRobert said the information would be gathered by bluetooth and would be sent to secure national health storage only if a user confirmed they had been diagnosed with coronavirus. It would then be given to state governments so they could contact individuals who may have come into contact with that user.\nRobert said the privacy commissioner was involved and a privacy impact assessment was being conducted.\nThe app\u2019s source code would be made public so all Australians could be assured of their privacy and security.\nIf enough Australians installed the app, it would allow the prime minister to loosen the restrictions and kickstart the economy again, he said.\nThe Covid website the government established has had 7m visits so far and the official government \u201cCoronavirus Australia\u201d app has had 2.7m downloads.\nWe will be seeking the cooperation and support of Australians to download the app to help our health workers, to protect our community and help get our economy going again.\n\u201cThe scale of the technology that we are putting in place is unprecedented in terms of this health emergency, and this will be one more application to build into that suite of apps,\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cNobody will be forced to use it. It is absolutely voluntary. There is no question I will be the first one to download it, probably after the prime minister, and we will be encouraging everybody to download it. I will be encouraging corporate Australia, not-for-profits to actually download it.\u201d",

        "content": "Amid lockdown, millions of internet users are tuning in to interactive data-crunching projects\nPeople feeling time hang heavy as they struggle with the restrictions of the lockdown may find an unexpected green uplift in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions placed on going outside are fuelling a new online surge in citizen science, as internet users tune into data-crunching projects led by academic researchers.\nEnforced inactivity for hundreds of millions of people around the world is giving scientists the opportunity to recruit a vast army of online helpers, aiming their collective firepower at some seemingly intractable problems, from the climate crisis to plastic waste, as well as some cute ones - spotting spider monkeys, interpreting baby burblings and snapping blossoms.\nUnlike some previous citizen science projects, such as the recently paused Search for Extra Terrrestrial Intelligence (Seti) that relied on exploiting the unused computing power of home PCs while their users were offline, this new crop requires people to be alert and often interactive. Instead of searching through outer space, the project leaders invite people to connect with nature and solve environmental problems closer to home.\n\u201cCitizen science helps scientists and researchers analyse huge data sets which they simply couldn\u2019t manage by themselves, helping to save them hours of time and contributing to scientific breakthroughs,\u201d said Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, which is helping to coordinate some of the UK-based initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic way to know you are making a positive difference without even having to leave your own home.\u201d\nCovid-19 is inevitably one of the most pressing research areas. Despite the efforts of governments and scientists around the world, data on the virus is still patchy, ranging from the very thorough in places such as Iceland, where a high proportion of people have been tested, to the alarmingly opaque, as the spread in many developing countries is likely be taking place without the tracking available in countries with better healthcare.\nDoctors and researchers at King\u2019s College London and Guys and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals are asking people to fill in data on their symptoms, or lack of them, through an app. The results around the UK are encouraging so far, as there has been a fall in the number of people aged 20-69 recording active symptoms, down to about 1.4 million people, from 1.9 million on 1 April. This is no substitute for proper testing, but will provide scientists with valuable data on the possible incidence and spread of the virus.\nFifty years ago, an estimated 20 million people took to the streets in the US and around the world to protest against the rampant destruction of the natural environment, the extinction of species, toxic pollution, and the despoliation of pristine habitats. Earth Day on 22 April 1970 marked the first major demonstration of a new environmentalism that sought to recognise the harm we were doing through untrammelled industrialism.\nThe results of that protest are still being felt, in legislation enacted to safeguard the environment, in the global climate movement and in conservation efforts. But planned demonstrations for the 50th anniversary \u2013 aimed at spurring a new generation of environmental activism \u2013 have had to be curtailed.\nEarth Day is now going online instead, and everyone with a smart phone or internet connection can take part. Two projects are currently active, on plastic and air quality, with more to follow, including tracking declining insect populations.\nTaking pictures of plastic litter and uploading them will allow for greater tracking of the plastic waste problem than has been possible up to now. Knowing what kind of litter is prevalent and where will help in formulating plastic waste reduction policies. The added bonus is that any cleaning up of plastic litter you do on your daily exercise outdoors will also be tracked.\nAir quality has improved under the coronavirus lockdowns, but that is likely to be short-lived as restrictions are lifted. The Earth Day air quality app invites people to photograph their horizon daily and send it in, to be processed centrally to gain a clearer picture of air pollution around the world.\nAnyone itching for a bit of escapism without forbidden travel can spend some quality time in central America, courtesy of the Spotting Spider Monkeys project.\nSpider monkeys are fascinating creatures, very long-lived primates that are slow to reproduce, with each female on average having only one infant every three years. Huge areas of the monkeys\u2019 habitat are being lost to agriculture and other encroachment, with palm oil production one of the leading causes. All spider monkey species are now classed as threatened with extinction.\nResearchers are now using drones to track spider monkeys through the forest, and using the footage they are developing an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of finding spider monkeys on its own. Before it can get to that stage, however, the systems needs to be fed thousands of images tagged for the presence of spider monkeys, to train the algorithm. This would take years, without the input of citizen scientists who are being asked to look at the images from surveillance cameras and point to the presence of spider monkeys.\nThis will also help researchers track the pattern of habitat loss and deforestation, which are threats to other species as well as the monkeys.\nLeaving home only once a day for exercise might seem to give little opportunity for outdoor citizen science projects, but you too can do your bit. Photographing blossom on your daily walk will help the National Trust compile a changing gallery of pictures from around the country to delight those who can\u2019t make it to see the spring blooms in person.\nHundreds of thousands of people have now joined up with the charity\u2019s #BlossomWatch, either by sending in pictures or looking at what others have contributed. The project was launched last month to emulate hanami, the Japanese custom of celebrating the fleeting sight and scent of blossom.\nNext year, the National Trust will develop the project further and produce a map to track the blossom across the UK, with a scientific purpose \u2013 it will help track climate change, and shed light on the pollinating insect who rely on blossom, and the birds who feed on them in turn.\nOn similar lines, the Nature\u2019s Calendar website run by the Woodland Trust allows people to record when they see their first butterfly or birds of the spring. With 2.9m records currently, it is the biggest biological record of its kind in the UK and ripe for more.\nCoronavirus lockdowns have cleared the streets of our cities of traffic and people and sent nature and wildlife bounding, splashing and scurrying to fill the vacuum. The City Nature Challenge has run for five years, but this year promises to be different.\nParticipants photograph any form of wildlife \u2013 from interesting fungi or even slime mould, to insects and birds, to the traces of animals \u2013 droppings, fur, feathers, shells or even carcases. They are uploaded via the iNaturalist app and the online community helps to identify them.\nIt takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife.\nOne for the rainy days is a project from Reading University, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain\u2019s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up detailed pictures of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change.\nBut some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the Rainfall Rescue project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records.\nRainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. \u201cThese records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.\u201d\nCoronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people\u2019s lives is through providing safe access to power, for clean cooking and for lighting, that will help children with their learning and adults to earn extra money.\nThe Power To the People project will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid.\nHuman speech is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day.\nThe resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound.\nArmchair researchers can listen to the recordings and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time?\nCoronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is on the rise again, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world.\nOver the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where resistance is growing. Nearly 20,000 volunteers have signed up already.\nPenguin Watch allows sharp-eyed citizen scientists to mark penguins in footage taken in the Antarctic from cameras set up by zoologists near colonies in the region. Penguins are under threat from the climate crisis, pollution, disturbance and fisheries.\nMonitoring has been inhibited by the difficulty of gaining access to such remote areas, and the ability to crunch through the data that has been collected.\nResearchers at Oxford University are using people\u2019s penguin spotting assistance to trawl through the collected data and enabling them to gauge the crucial timing of key events in the penguin\u2019s yearly cycle, and tell whether they are changing under the influence of global heating.",

On a planning statement proposing the creation of the national football centre, the architects wrote: \u201cThe new open area of water will provide suitable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies, breeding opportunities for amphibians and foraging habitat for bats.\n\u201cThe margins of the open water will be planted with native species such as sweet flag and common reed and other aquatic species will be included. Public access will be controlled to prevent disturbance to ground nesting birds.\u201d\nJay Tiernan from Stop the Cull said: \u201cThere is something sinister in creating a pond which you show off as part of your green credentials, only to slaughter the birds that come to use it because you don\u2019t like bird poo on your lawn.\n\u201cTheir planning permission application in part hinged on the benefits of the development to wildlife, so to then go and kill the geese is shocking. It\u2019s a terrible act of hypocrisy.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cLet the wild be wild. Nature should be allowed to flourish, and organisations like the Football Association should be leading the way with a far more holistic approach towards wild animals.\u201d\nThirty-two other licences to kill greylag geese to protect public health were granted in 2018, data published by Natural England shows. And more than 67,000 licences to kill individual geese or destroy their eggs or nests have been granted in the last five years.",

        "content": "In the second of our series, Stefanie Glinski looks at how life in the normally bustling city of Kabul has been reshaped by lockdown, with roads and playgrounds empty as people try to keep their distance\nDriving up one of Kabul\u2019s many steep hills, dotted with colourfully painted houses and surrounded by the snow-capped Hindu Kush mountains, the Afghan capital looks just like any other day.\nChildren fly kites in the mild spring breeze, families take to their roofs to watch the sunset, bakers light their ovens to make fresh bread.\nBut go in closer and the city of roughly 6 million people has changed. The usually traffic-jammed roads are almost empty, playgrounds are left without children, no restaurant is grilling sizzling kebabs by the roadside, and most people who are out wear face masks, their eyes fearful, suspicious.\nI usually navigate Kabul by motor scooter, a quick mode of transport on the otherwise busy roads \u2013 and now, in the time of coronavirus, a measure to keep the kind of distance that wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed in a taxi.\nAt least 700 infections have been recorded throughout the country but, if more testing were available, the number would probably rise. The capital has been put on lockdown, with the city\u2019s head of hospitals, Nizamuddin Jalil, saying that \u201cwe will enter a critical period in the next three weeks\u201d.\nAt the Afghan-Japan hospital for communicable diseases, the city\u2019s main coronavirus treatment centre, hundreds of patients arrive every day; most of them are sent home after a short consultation and temperature measurement.\nThe ministry of public health has warned of a catastrophe as cases rise.\nLike most, I stay home as much as I can. But if I want to document the pandemic, I have to venture out. There are measures, of course: gloves, a mask, hand sanitiser. After each assignment, I disinfect my equipment and wash my clothes, always worried that I could be a coronavirus carrier, spreading it to others, especially those willing to have their photos taken or be interviewed.\nAfter covering the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, I swore to never report on infectious diseases again, because \u2013 unlike conflict \u2013 such work comes with a different underlying fear, of an invisible threat. You can\u2019t run from it easily. Yet reporting on the coronavirus is not a choice for journalists; for most, it\u2019s inevitable.\nVisually Kabul is beautiful, intriguing, stunning. A mix of Persian and Islamic architecture, as well as older, mud-brick neighbourhoods, the city\u2019s roads wind themselves through dramatic hills.\nPeople wear colourful dresses; the sun almost always shines. In some areas, life has to continue almost as usual, as food and vegetable markets are allowed to remain open and crowds mingle there.\nNamadulli Asad, 48, a construction worker, can\u2019t afford to stay at home and lose his daily pay. Harissa, three, her face covered by a mask, sits on the now empty street every day, begging for food and money with her mother. Asma, also three, lives in a comfortable apartment with her parents, gazing out of the window as her family has quarantined to keep safe. The discrepancies in Afghanistan are vast.\nDr Ahmed Sultani, director of a 1,000-bed drug rehabilitation hospital, roamed Kabul\u2019s streets last week in a full protective suit, getting addicts off the streets and into treatment in the hope of preventing coronavirus from spreading further in some of the most dense neighbourhoods.\n\u201cThere are about 86,000 drug users here, and we\u2019re hoping to quarantine as many as possible,\u201d he said.\nAfghanistan has suffered more than 40 years of war, causing trauma, suffering and deep-seated frustration and engraving violent, unwanted images in people\u2019s minds. Millions fled or died, yet Afghans have preserved their warmth and thirst for life.\nIn a culture of hospitality, of sharing meals and cups of green tea, the coronavirus demands time away from embraces and open doors, and this has been difficult. The new realities of the pandemic trickle in slowly as infections rise quickly. Keeping physical distance from each other is mostly not observed throughout Kabul.\nThe hardships Afghanistan has faced are almost innumerable. The pandemic is just another misfortune on an already long list of war, Taliban rule, suicide attacks, targeted killings, earthquakes, floods, poverty, political turmoil.\nYet the country\u2019s people have learned to press on, even in times of deep-seated fear. On weekends, Kabul residents take to the otherwise deserted mountains for hikes and picnics \u2013 these days in smaller family units. Many play music, dance or fly their kites. Decades of war haven\u2019t destroyed their kind-hearted spirit; neither will the pandemic.",

        "content": "A decade ago, the fishermen were sentenced to a total of 104 years in prison. Now, new evidence suggests they are innocent\nThe first arrests took place on the harbour at Yarmouth, the cobbled, picture-book port that lies on the Isle of Wight\u2019s quieter western side. It was a Sunday evening, 30 May 2010, almost a decade ago, but Nicky Green still sees it in Technicolor. She was working in Salty\u2019s, the family\u2019s restaurant just yards from the marina. \u201cIt was the bank holiday weekend and we were absolutely stacked,\u201d she says. Her parents were serving behind the bar, her daughter was waiting tables and her younger brother, Jamie, a 42-year-old fisherman, was out on the quay, just back from sea. \u201cI\u2019d called and asked him to bring in some lobsters,\u201d Nicky recalls. \u201cI was expecting him to walk through the door when someone told me he\u2019d been arrested.\u201d\nIn the moment, she was too busy to follow it up. \u201cI was juggling the food, the crowds, the tables, and I knew Jamie was having an issue with some other fishermen \u2013 they were accusing each other of pinching lobster pots, and he was dodging the CID guy trying to deal with it. I thought this was fishermen bickering. I never on this Earth thought it was serious. How would I have ever imagined the gravity?\u201d\nBut Jamie Green never came back. A year later, on 2 June 2011, Green, his crew of three \u2013 Scott Birtwistle, Daniel Payne and Zoran Dresic, as well as Jonathan Beere, a local scaffolder \u2013 were found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs. Their sentences, a combined total of 104 years, reflected the scale of the haul: a fisherman had found 250kg of cocaine worth an estimated \u00a353m roped together in holdalls and floating in the island\u2019s Freshwater Bay.\nThe men, now known as the Freshwater Five, were not typical multimillion-pound drug smugglers. They had no previous convictions relating to drugs or dishonesty, no forensic evidence linked them to the cocaine, and a Proceeds of Crime Act inquiry assessed their gains from criminality at zero. They did not lead lavish lifestyles, and how they planned to distribute such a quantity of drugs was not made clear. The case has rocked the island, dividing friends, family and fishermen. While Birtwistle and Payne are out on licence, the remaining three men are nine years into 24-year sentences. Now new evidence means their case is coming back to the appeal court, a chance for all five to clear their names.\nA couple of miles across the Solent from the UK mainland, the Isle of Wight\u2019s private beaches, secluded inlets and narrow valleys have made it a smuggling base for centuries. It remains strangely isolated, a place where many juggle two or three jobs, since wages, employment and opportunities are all markedly lower than in the rest of the south-east. But for most, smuggling has been relegated to movies and history books. Today, the movement of drugs, firearms and people belongs to organised crime \u2013 which is partly why the Freshwater Five case stands out.\nJamie Green, the central figure linking the men, was born and raised on the island; at trial, the prosecution accepted that he was \u201ca legitimate lobster fisherman\u201d. His parents founded Salty\u2019s more than 25 years ago, converting a garage first into a fish shop, then a bar and restaurant, which are now under new ownership. \u201cAs a kid, Jamie was fishing mad \u2013 that\u2019s all he has ever done,\u201d Nicky says. Green left school at 16, got his first boat at 17, and by 2010 owned the 39ft Galwad-y-Mor, supplying London restaurants and fishmongers, and exporting to mainland Europe.\nThe family were well known in Yarmouth. Green had convictions for public order offences and drunkenness \u2013 and always pleaded guilty. \u201cHe was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, and there are a lot of fools round Yarmouth,\u201d Nicky says. At the time of his arrest, Nikki, his wife of 21 years and the mother of their three children, was being treated for breast cancer.\nBirtwistle, the Galwad\u2019s only permanent crew member, saw Green as a mentor. Now 29, he has moved back home with his mother on the mainland in Selsey, a seaside town in Sussex. Calm and measured, he\u2019s balancing his wish to speak out with a wariness of not being believed.\nLike Green, Birtwistle had always loved fishing. \u201cI loved the freedom. It didn\u2019t even feel like a job,\u201d he says. On leaving school, he placed an ad on findafishingboat.com. Green contacted him in December 2009, and within weeks Birtwistle had moved to the island to live in a caravan on Green\u2019s land and crew the Galwad. \u201cJamie knew his stuff and taught me so much,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Selsey, skippers take control and don\u2019t teach you anything in case you get your own boat and take their business. Jamie was different.\u201d\nDanny Payne, now 45, had known Green since his teens. Now back on the Isle of Wight, he\u2019s working on building sites, still adjusting to \u201clife outside\u201d. Payne had been a more reluctant crew member on that bank holiday trip. \u201cDo you know Quint, the shark hunter from Jaws?\u201d Payne asks. \u201cWell, that was Jamie. I used to call him Quint. He\u2019d bark and shout if you were doing it wrong, but he sure knows his way around a boat.\n\u201cI\u2019d worked for Jamie a lot over the years and used to enjoy it,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy dad was a submariner, and I\u2019ve always been around the sea. But by then, I was living with my girlfriend, we had a rescue dog and I didn\u2019t want to go out on the boat for days on end. I was doing more building work for nearly as much money, but I knew Nikki was ill and Jamie was having problems finding crew. It\u2019s ridiculously hard and always dangerous \u2013 even in the calmest weather, there\u2019s rope flying, the stink of rotting crab and fish and diesel. Most people only came once.\u201d\nZoran Dresic, 36 and from Montenegro, was the third crew member. Married with three children, he\u2019d worked in Austria and Italy before coming to the UK on a false passport just two days before. According to Dresic, he\u2019d been promised work by a friend of a friend. This was not unusual \u2013 the whole fishing industry uses foreign crew and the Yarmouth harbourmaster confirmed the Galwad\u2019s high turnover. However, the prosecution\u2019s case was that Dresic, who spoke no English and had little if any fishing experience, had come with the express purpose of overseeing a drug drop, and that the \u201cfriends of friends\u201d \u2013 two men who\u2019d delivered Dresic to the island before returning to the mainland and disappearing \u2013 were coconspirators.\nGreen set sail with his crew on the afternoon of Saturday 29 May, heading to the shipping lanes where cargo ships head east to Europe or west to the United States. According to Green, the forecast was bad but expected to break around midnight, by which time they\u2019d have reached the five-mile central reservation between the lanes, less heavily fished and rich with spring tides. What he couldn\u2019t have known was that it was also the centre of a massive police operation that weekend, run by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and Middle Market Drugs Partnership (both of which have since been disbanded).\nOperation Disorient had received intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship, to be picked up by a smaller boat and taken ashore. Patrol ships and surveillance planes were looking out, and at some point the Galwad crossed their radar. Mid-channel, where the suspected transfer took place, in the dead of night in a force eight gale, there was nothing much to see. The Galwad\u2019s instruments show that the boat never stopped moving, though at 12.40am, for three and a half minutes, it reduced its speed from 5 knots to .57 of a knot. The prosecution claimed this was sufficient for Green and his crew to recover 11 holdalls of cocaine they believed had been jettisoned by a passing container ship, the MSC Oriane, travelling to Holland from Brazil. (The Oriane continued on; no trace of drugs were found on it. )\nHow close these two vessels came has been hotly disputed, and at trial, one expert witness said he couldn\u2019t help but be \u201camused\u201d by the prosecution\u2019s claims. Anyone on the Oriane, travelling at 18 knots, would have risked ripping the holdalls apart if they chucked \u00a353m of cocaine into the sea. And on the Galwad, in the pitch black, in high winds, on rough seas, retrieving even one holdall in three and a half minutes would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d.\nIn any case, the Galwad eventually headed back towards the island. That Sunday was clear and bright. The boat stayed out all day \u2013 in full view of bank holiday crowds, plus two police officers on Tennyson Down, a grassy chalk cliff with panoramic sea views. Shortly before the Galwad arrived back in Yarmouth, these police officers radioed in an entry: \u201cSU116 (the Galwad\u2019s ID number) is moving westbound, six to seven items overboard at intervals.\u201d Green has claimed that, if these \u201citems overboard\u201d were anything, they were old bait and waste; the crew may have been clearing the boat at the end of the trip, though he doesn\u2019t recall doing so.\nOn arrival in Yarmouth, baskets of lobster in their arms, they were arrested and the boat seized. Police were so certain drugs were on board that Green\u2019s original charge sheet cited \u201cpossession and intent to supply\u201d. The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Its tank was pumped, an itemiser \u2013 a highly sensitive piece of police equipment \u2013 scanned every inch of the boat, but no molecule of cocaine was found.\nThe following morning, Monday 31 May, a lobster fisherman found 11 holdalls, each stacked with cocaine, strung together on a rope attached to a weighted buoy in Freshwater Bay. (It was an area too shallow for the Galwad to have reached, but the prosecution claimed the holdalls may have drifted.)\nThis is where the investigation gets contentious. The court heard that on the Monday morning, in a police operation debrief, substantial amendments were made to the police log \u2013 so many that they became longer than the log itself. (In court, the log keeper claimed her radio had stopped working during the operation, which meant much had been missed.) The most critical amendment, and the only direct evidence linking the men to the drugs, was made by the two police officers from Tennyson Down. Contrary to strict protocol, they didn\u2019t attend the debrief, but made this amendment when they met the surveillance commander in a car park. It read: \u201cThe items appeared to be dark in colour and approximately the size of a large holdall. They were tied together on a line and were dispatched from the boat one after another, totalling 10-12. The last item was a red floating buoy.\u201d\nHad Green really deposited this enormous haul of cocaine when it was clear and sunny, in a bay where the shore and cliffs were heaving with people? Would an experienced fisherman leave the bags floating and drifting instead of carefully anchored and submerged? And having witnessed such a suspicious deposit, would police leave these items in the sea all night without even taking a photograph or noting the GPS? (In court, one of the police officers claimed they didn\u2019t have a camera.)\nNo more evidence emerged. There were satellite calls made on the Galwad at sea that Saturday night \u2013 but their content is unknown. Although the cocaine was damp, suggesting leakage, no traces were found on the boat. And though a guilty plea would have substantially reduced their sentences, all five insisted they were innocent. Before the trial, police visited Payne in Parkhurst prison, offering freedom in exchange for information, but Payne insisted he had nothing to give. \u201cMy girlfriend had split up with me. They knew I was struggling,\u201d he says. \u201cThey told me I didn\u2019t have to be there, I could go wherever I wanted, I could have a new identity \u2013 but I told them I didn\u2019t know anything. That fishing trip was your normal bloody nightmare like every other fishing trip.\u201d\nPerhaps the figure most tenuously linked to all this was the fifth man, Jon Beere, who was arrested eight months later, then tried and convicted alongside the Galwad crew. Beere was 42, married for 18 years to Sue, a special needs support worker, and father of Elle, Maisie and Flynn. He ran a scaffolding business and though, according to Sue, Beere and Green weren\u2019t close, they\u2019d known each other for years \u201cas everyone on the island is connected\u201d.\nFor nine years, Sue has raised their children without Beere. \u201cWhen it happened, Jon had a scaffolding job on the harbourmaster\u2019s building in Yarmouth, right by Jamie\u2019s boat,\u201d she says. The case against Beere is that, on Friday 28 May, the day before the fishing trip, he\u2019d taken his distinctive pick-up on the hovercraft to Portsmouth, where he met Dresic, and delivered him, along with two associates who were helping him as they spoke English, to Green. The defence claimed that Green had been at sea, unable to collect this potential crew member, so he\u2019d called Beere from his boat and asked him to do it as a favour. This was the extent of the case against the scaffolder.\n\u201cThe biggest joke is that for doing that, he was the land-based criminal mastermind, the \u2018organiser\u2019,\u201d Sue says. The prosecution failed to produce any phone records, emails, texts or other lines of communication between Beere and whoever was supplying the drugs from abroad, or any other network, other than these two men. \u201cJon\u2019s the most disorganised person I know,\u201d Sue continues. \u201cHis filing system is Tesco bags tied with a knot, or telephone numbers scribbled on scraps of paper. He used to drive his poor secretary round the twist. Jon was very much part of the community \u2013 he\u2019d do anything for anyone. He wouldn\u2019t just give you a lift, he\u2019d lend you his car. He was a decent bloke. I talk like he\u2019s dead! But it\u2019s so hard, because every aspect of life hasn\u2019t been the same since.\u201d\nThe Freshwater Five\u2019s trial took place in Kingston upon Thames, Soca\u2019s home turf, though the defence team had pushed for it to be held locally, or somewhere jurors might understand conditions at sea. \u201cDespite that, we still went into it believing it would all be resolved, that in a minute someone would see sense,\u201d Nicky Green says. \u201cYou\u2019re in this arena, you don\u2019t know the rules, and you don\u2019t see the steam train coming at you.\u201d Although the judge\u2019s final summary appeared to pour doubt on much of the evidence \u2013 referring to the \u201clarge number of additions and alterations\u201d to the police log and the \u201cextraordinary\u201d account from Tennyson Down \u2013 the jury reached a guilty verdict with a majority of 11 to one.\n\u201cIt was like one of those films where the whole tone changes, like someone has flicked a switch,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cThere was this huge rush of emotion. Sue was howling. Nikki was howling. You\u2019re picking up all these broken people around you.\u201d\nThe sentences followed that same day, the harshest reserved for Green, Beere and Dresic, who were seen as more deeply involved. \u201cI remember hearing \u201824 years\u2019,\u201d Sue says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge number. If it had been a year, I\u2019d have been devastated, but 24? How was I going to tell the children? How was I going to cope? What about the business? What about the house? What about\u2026 us?\u201d\nHow has she coped? \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve got through it, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d she says. \u201cSupport, love, family, friends \u2013 and believing in Jon. My dad does the \u2018blue jobs\u2019 \u2013 splitting the wood, fixing the car. My mum has been amazing with the children.\n\u201cWhen Jon was arrested, our eldest was doing her GCSEs and our youngest was still in playschool. He\u2019s missed Elle getting her GCSE results, he\u2019s missed the birth of Willow, his first grandchild. He\u2019s missed two graduations. Maisie\u2019s first communion. Flynn\u2019s first day at primary. His last day at primary. Jon has never seen Flynn play football, and Flynn\u2019s in the top team on the island. He missed his best friend\u2019s funeral last year. Births, marriages, deaths. Everything.\u201d\nJamie Green has also missed family milestones. His children have grown up, begun work, had children. One daughter now runs a local crab business (We\u2019ve Got Crabs) and his son, just 13 when Green was arrested, is now a North Sea skipper. Their mother Nikki died of cancer four years into Green\u2019s sentence. For 18 months, she was too sick to make the journey from Yarmouth to HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire \u2013 though Green was allowed to visit her once in a hospice. He also attended her funeral, handcuffed to a guard.\n\u201cThere were about 700 people there and every one of them tried to hug him,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cFair play to the prisoner officer \u2013 he did his best to get out the way, with arms flying everywhere.\u201d Green also gave the eulogy with the guard crouched behind the podium. Green has said that when his voice started to falter, the guard quietly urged him on, and told him he could do it.\nThe appeal has given some hope to the families. It\u2019s being fought by Emily Bolton, the English lawyer who founded the Innocence Project New Orleans (which has exonerated 36 people to date) and is now director of Appeal. For Bolton, working in the UK has been a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s far slower, there\u2019s less access to information, no one picks up the phone, there\u2019s no sense of urgency,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US, we got someone out in one year \u2013 I\u2019ve been working on this case for six.\u201d\nOne piece of evidence that Bolton had been requesting since 2014 \u2013 and that forms the basis of this appeal \u2013 finally arrived at the end of 2019. It involves the digital data taken from the onboard computer of the police cutter that was tracking the Galwad that night. The data had reportedly not been disclosed or used at trial, but shows two things. One is that in the shipping lanes around the time of the \u201chandover\u201d, the Oriane was heading south, moving further from the Galwad than had been suggested in court.\nMore significantly for Bolton, back at Freshwater Bay at the time of the \u201cdeposit\u201d, it showed a mystery vessel heading towards the exact location where the drugs were later found, after the Galwad had passed through the area. \u201cThat was either the ultimate suspect panicking and dumping the drugs because police were everywhere, or a police boat going to search the area the Galwad had left and finding nothing,\u201d Bolton says. \u201cEither of those should have been disclosed at trial \u2013 and if it had been, I\u2019ve no doubt the men would not have been convicted.\u201d\nShe\u2019s cautiously optimistic. \u201cI think the evidence is strong,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s digital, not something subject to human interference \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wake up at 4am worrying about it. The families have been through so much, the idea that we might lose is absolutely chilling.\u201d\nFor the men themselves, there\u2019s hope mixed with dread mixed with disbelief. During Sue Beere\u2019s most recent prison visit, her husband said that perhaps, with luck, this would be one of the last times she\u2019d have to make the journey. But Birtwistle and Payne have lower expectations. \u201cThis has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Birtwistle says, \u201cbut even if I clear my name, I\u2019ll always have the stigma.\u201d Payne abandoned hope years ago. \u201cIt was not doing me any good mentally,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you continue to think about it, you\u2019d go mad. I\u2019ve got no faith in the system any more, no faith whatsoever \u2013 and when I accepted that, it just got easier.\u201d\n This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to add Emily Bolton\u2019s current role as director of Appeal.",

        "content": "Without mass testing, contact tracing, and protective equipment for health workers \u2013 all in critically short supply \u2013 the president\u2019s plan could be disastrous\nOn Thursday evening, Donald Trump took to the dais in the White House press briefing room and declared that he was leading America in a \u201chistoric battle against the invisible enemy\u201d that amounted to the \u201cgreatest national mobilisation since world war two\u201d.\nWarming to his theme, the US president said the country was now ready to move to the next phase in the war against coronavirus. It was time, he said, \u201cto open up. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open\u201d.\nUnveiling new guidelines for the loosening of the lockdown, he committed his administration to a \u201cscience-based reopening\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are starting our life again, we are starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.\u201d\nBeyond the cloistered confines of the White House an alternative interpretation of events was gathering force. On a day in which the US suffered its highest death toll from Covid-19, with a total of more than 680,000 confirmed cases and 34,000 deaths, public health experts were scrutinising the president\u2019s new guidelines and coming to rather different conclusions.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a plan, it\u2019s barely a PowerPoint,\u201d spluttered Ron Klain on Twitter. Klain, the US government\u2019s Ebola tsar during the last health crisis to test the White House, in 2014, said the proposals contained \u201cno provision to ramp up testing, no standard on levels of disease before opening, no protections for workers or customers\u201d.\nOn 28 March the Guardian exposed the missing six weeks lost as a result of Trump\u2019s dithering and downplaying of the crisis when the virus first struck. Jeremy Konyndyk, another central figure in the US battle against Ebola, told the Guardian that the Trump administration\u2019s initial response was \u201cone of the greatest failures of basic governance and leadership in modern times\u201d.\nNow that the US is contemplating a shift into the second phase of the crisis \u2013 a tentative reopening of the economy \u2013 scientists and public health officials are agreed that three pillars need to be put into place to manage the transition safely. They are: mass testing to identify those who are infected, contact tracing to isolate other people who may have caught Covid-19 from them, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield frontline healthcare workers from any flare-up.\nA chorus of expert voices has also begun to be heard warning that those three essential pillars remain in critically short supply throughout the US. Less than a month after the Guardian\u2019s exploration of the missing six weeks, the chilling recognition is dawning that the country is heading for a second massive failure of governance under Trump, this time on an even bigger scale.\nUnless testing capability is dramatically ramped up and a giant army of health workers assembled to trace the contacts of those infected \u2013 right now \u2013 the consequences could be devastating.\n\u201cI\u2019m fearful,\u201d said Dr Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u201cTesting remains scarce in many parts of the country and it\u2019s slow to scale up \u2013 we are weeks if not months away from having enough test capacity.\u201d\nFrieden, who now heads the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives, told the Guardian in an interview conducted shortly before Trump released the new reopening guidelines that time was being wasted. The federal government\u2019s misplaced insistence in February that its China travel ban would be enough to make the virus go away had \u201clost precious weeks\u201d in tackling the first wave of coronavirus.\nNow, as the US contemplates reopening, Frieden said he was afraid a repeat performance was imminent.\n\u201cI fear there\u2019s an analogous mistaken belief that sheltering in place will make this virus go away, that we can then choose a date and all come out. It\u2019s not about the date, it\u2019s about data and building a national response at scale.\u201d\nIn a series of tweets posted in reaction to the new White House guidelines, Konyndyk echoed the anxiety about more lost weeks. He said the Trump administration had \u201cwasted February, and the White House guidance on \u2018opening up\u2019 leaves me worried that we\u2019re about to waste April too\u201d.\nKonyndyk said that for states to reopen before they were ready \u201cwould be a disaster. It\u2019s no great insight to say we need more testing, tracing, PPE [protective gear for health workers] \u2013 it\u2019s been obvious for a month and a half. But each of those face huge bottlenecks and the document doesn\u2019t acknowledge them, much less propose how to resolve them.\u201d\nTrump, launching the new reopening guidelines on Thursday, insisted that the US was in \u201cexcellent shape\u201d on testing. \u201cWe have great tests. We have done more testing now than any country, in the world, by far.\u201d\nThe US has so far tested about 3.3 million people, about 1% of its population. Per capita, that is small compared with several countries including Germany and South Korea. Iceland has tested people at 10 times the US rate.\n\u201cTesting has been an unnecessary disaster,\u201d said Michael Greenberger, director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. \u201cTrump says we have the best testing, but the US is in the last percentage of tests administered to its population.\u201d\nNot one of the 50 states is currently in a position to carry out tracking of Covid-19 infections on the scale needed, whatever Trump said about their readiness to reopen. Many states, including the hardest hit, New York, are still experiencing testing shortages, 12 weeks after the first US case was recorded.\nIndividual states continue to have to compete for critical supplies against each other, and against the federal government, driving up prices. Components including nasal swabs, reagents and RNA extraction kits are running short.\nDaily testing has flattened out and is now hovering around 150,000 tests a day \u2013 vastly below the level that would be needed to detect localized pockets of disease as the economy reopens. Most alarmingly, the number of tests carried out by commercial labs has actually plummeted in recent days due to shortages in test samples, leaving the labs sitting idle.\nAt the White House briefing, Trump insisted that the phenomenon of the idle labs was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d, a sign that states were finding local solutions and an \u201caffirmation that testing is growing at a historic rate\u201d.\nAll of these impediments have put the US on the back foot as it seeks to pull off the daunting feat of getting back to work without risking a renewed surge of contagion.\n\u201cWe have had cases circulating in communities undetected for several weeks, and because of the delay in the roll-out of testing we never had the chance to be on top of it,\u201d said Anita Cicero. She is joint author of one of the most definitive scientific plans for reopening the US, produced by a team from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University.\n\u201cThat means it\u2019s going to require much more ubiquitous testing,\u201d she said.\nEstimates vary on how much testing will be needed, but they are all substantially greater than present provision. Even at the lower end, as posited by the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb, some 2m to 3m tests a week are recommended \u2013 up to three times the current level.\nHarvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics argues that is too few. It calls for tens of millions of tests every day, way beyond existing capacity.\nAs the Johns Hopkins plan makes clear, diagnostic testing is only the start. It must be combined with relentless detective work, called \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, to track down anyone who has come into contact with an infected person and who may need quarantining to stop the virus spreading again.\nThe Johns Hopkins plan envisages a nationwide army of 100,000 contact tracers. \u201cThat might sound eye-popping, but it\u2019s reasonable and may be a low estimate,\u201d Cicero said, pointing out that in Wuhan, China, the authorities employed a workforce three times the size per capita.\nWith contact tracing, too, there is no sign that Trump recognizes the urgency of the moment. Frieden told the Guardian that many states were already struggling to ramp up contact tracing to a level that would support reopening. Health departments are overwhelmed, and some have \u201ctrouble even conceiving the scale of operations they are going to need\u201d, he said.\nFaced with a wide gap between nationwide demand for testing and contact tracing and insufficient supply, Trump has flip-flopped in his positions. He began by insisting that he had \u201cabsolute authority\u201d to overrule the states in deciding when to reopen, a posture widely denounced as king-like and anti-American.\nOn Thursday he effected an about-turn and passed the buck to the 50 states. \u201cYou are going to call your own shots,\u201d he told governors on a call on Thursday.\nTrump\u2019s sudden switch to offloading federal responsibility to the 50 states has prompted questions about his motive. Current and former senior officials in the Trump administration told the Washington Post that he wanted to \u201cshield himself from blame should there be new outbreaks after states reopen\u201d.\nThe former head of Medicare and Medicaid from 2015 to 2017, Andy Slavitt, commented on Twitter that the White House guidelines were sending a clear message to the states: \u201cYour state didn\u2019t open, that\u2019s on your governor. Your state opened and people died, that\u2019s on your governor.\u201d\nTrump attempted to sell the idea of devolving responsibility by presenting his vision of America as a \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d. He said: \u201cI call it a beautiful puzzle. You have 50 pieces. All very different. But when it\u2019s done \u2026 a very beautiful picture.\u201d\nA \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d may be an appealing concept to the incumbent of the Oval Office in an election year. But it fits uncomfortably with a virus that is highly contagious, relatively deadly, and dismissive of state boundaries.\n\u201cThe states are not islands, their borders are not closed and they do not have water around them,\u201d Cicero said. \u201cSo it will be a bumpy road going forward in terms of managing the virus.\u201d\nStates still held in the grip of the contagion, such as New York, are finding it difficult to accept the idea that the buck stops with them in a country with the most powerful national government on Earth. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to do more to help.\n\u201cI understand that the federal government\u2019s not eager to get involved in testing. But the plain reality here is we have to do it in partnership,\u201d he said on Thursday.\nAt Trump\u2019s disposal is the formidable wartime power of the Defense Production Act, which allows the administration to order corporations to redirect their efforts to the cause of fighting Covid-19. So far the president has deployed this capability only sparingly.\nThe president said there were 29 states which are in \u201cextremely good shape\u201d and could reopen soon, some \u201cliterally tomorrow\u201d. He declined to name them, though it has been reported that several Republican governors are champing at the bit to loosen lockdowns.\nFlorida, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi are at the head of the line, according to Axios. Florida began to reopen its beaches on Friday, a controversial move given that the late closure of its beaches during spring break helped spread Covid-19 across the US.\nThe danger of Trump\u2019s \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d approach is illustrated by New York City, where the death toll is heartwrenching. The probable tally of deaths from Covid-19 in the city now stands at more than 11,000 \u2013 more than double the normal monthly loss of life from all other causes.\n\u201cI\u2019m moved and crushed by what\u2019s happening in New York right now,\u201d said Frieden, who until 2009 was the city\u2019s health commissioner.\nAbout 10,000 New Yorkers a day are currently being tested for coronavirus. Mark Levine, chair of New York City council\u2019s health committee, told the Guardian that the frequency would need to be stepped up twentyfold were the city to have a fighting chance at reopening.\nYet even now New York is just days away from running out of testing kits.\nLevine said he worries that the window for federal action is rapidly closing. \u201cTrump has the authority to order manufacturers to retool to produce test kits. Unless the White House issues the order immediately, we are going to be out of time.\u201d\n This article was amended on 21 April 2020. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb recommended that at least \u201c2m to 3m tests a day\u201d were carried out. This has been corrected to say 2m to 3m tests a week.",

        "content": "Access to technology is essential for prisoners, writes former inmate Michael Baldwin Jr \u2013 and coronavirus has only heightened the need\nWhile the majority of the US maintains some form of social distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus, people in prison across the US remain more isolated than ever.\nFederal prisons in the country are in the midst of a lockdown, as the spread of coronavirus leads to riots inside and struggles to curb the disease\u2019s spread. Advocates say the inability to receive visitors means there is also unprecedented need for access to technology for prisoners.\n\u201cEven in calmer times, draconian limitations on social media access are dangerous and raise serious first amendment concerns,\u201d Mark Rumold, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, wrote. \u201cAs the pandemic unfolds, state agencies should take a flexible approach to enforcement of restrictions on inmates\u2019 ability to connect with the outside world.\u201d\nOn 6 April, the technology company Securus announced it would provide free messaging services on its JP5 tablet at more than 600 facilities across the US, to allow inmates to stay in contact with loved ones outside the prison during the Covid-19 crisis. The company has more than 290,000 in use across the country.\nWhile the high cost of such technology has been the subject of criticism, inmates say the importance of access is undeniable \u2013 especially today. Human rights groups have demanded that such devices should be free for all incarcerated people for the duration of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\u201cPeople in jails, prisons, and detention centers are extremely vulnerable populations in terms of censorship and exploitation by prison profiteers like Securus and GTL\u201d, Michelle Dillon, public records manager of the Human Rights Defense Center said. \u201cEspecially during a global pandemic, it is crucial that prisoners retain access to tools for connecting to information and their communities, and that these tools be made available without exorbitant price tags\u201d.\nMichael Baldwin Jr, 48, knows the reality first-hand. He has spent more than 20 years incarcerated and now works as a director at a prison advocacy group. This is how access to technology changed his life.\nI went to prison in 1992 with a life sentence. Once I got inside, I quickly began to adapt to the environment. To survive, I had to adjust to being incarcerated. I lost touch with my children. I lost touch with many of my family members.\nFor many people in prison, not knowing how technology works can become the catalyst of sending them right back as soon as they get out. If you don\u2019t know technology when you come home it\u2019s like moving to China without knowing Chinese. It would be difficult for someone to thrive in that environment without someone holding their hand and helping them navigate.\nIn the tablet I found my missing piece \u2013 I found what I needed to be able to be motivated by my role as a father, to really strengthen my education and to strengthen just me as an individual \u2013 and, eventually, to find my way back to freedom.\nEventually I started to look inside myself and try to change myself. I wasn\u2019t in prison because I was a nice guy \u2013 I was in there paying for crimes I committed. I needed to learn responsibility. But many things were still missing because I was completely disconnected from my family. When I finally got access to a secure tablet, it helped me to start bridging the gap between me and my children and become whole again.\nI had spent 22 years in prison \u2013 so technology was something that was completely foreign to me. I didn\u2019t know much about texting or emails, because I went to prison at the end of 1992 \u2013 there wasn\u2019t very much technology at that time.\nMeanwhile, my children were growing up in an era where there was great access to technology. It didn\u2019t allow for us to communicate well, because they do not know how to write letters. But they can text you, they can email you.\nOnce I got the  tablet, I was able to contact one of my sons and he immediately was able to start communicating with me. He shared my contact with his siblings, my other children, and it opened up the door for us to be able to really have a dialogue for the first time.\nThe first videogram I got was of my son and my grandson. I  hadn\u2019t had any interaction with my son [since I went to prison]. And now to see my son with his son, in a videogram. I sat for days just watching my tablet, watching this video of them interacting with each other over and over. It made me feel like I was a human being again. Now, I was human, I was a father. I was actually experiencing the feeling of being a grandfather before I ever even touched my grandson.\nI was sold on the tablet immediately. Many of my peers were, too. It even changed the way that we interact with each other. In prison, sometimes the wrong type of look from somebody can create a violent situation. But now, guys would start to avoid confrontations because they did not want to lose access to their tablets. It changed the whole dynamic.\nThere was definitely a learning curve. When I texted my children I didn\u2019t know what these letters like \u201clol\u201d and \u201csmh\u201d meant. But I was quickly adapting and learning. Knowing what an email was, knowing what an app was or what a text was gave me a bridge back to society for when I got out. \nI used the tablet for music: hip-hop, oldies, jazz and some rock. I also used it as a library and have a wide variety of self-development books and audio books on it. I enjoyed reading Man\u2019s Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl. My favorite were the meditation sounds. I could be at the beach while sitting on my bunk. It made my snoring bunkmate tolerable.\nNow that I am home, I still use the tablet for the music and books I downloaded.\nThe tablet was allowing me to have a stronger relationship with my children, as well as equipping my mind with what I was going to need to make it back into society one day.\nI was released from prison on 18 October 2018, and I took my tablet with me. Today I work at a law office for one of the attorneys that represented me. I\u2019m also a professional development trainer for the Modesto school district. I\u2019m also a member of the NAACP as well as the ACLU.\nI work along with a couple of prison ministries that help bring hope and healing into the prison system. But my biggest goal is to put technology in the hands of our nation\u2019s inmates to reconnect families and rehabilitate inmates.",

Now there are calls to relax the rules amid growing concern over their mental health\nWith each passing day, the bickering bouncing off the walls of one 90 sq metre apartment in Barcelona has sharpened further. As Spain\u2019s confinement stretches past five weeks, Ada Colau has watched her two children, aged nine and three, wilt under the pressure of life in lockdown.\n\u201cWeek after week, they fight with each other more and more. They have fits of sadness, of anger,\u201d said the mayor of Barcelona. \u201cThe three-year-old, who was already out of nappies, has regressed and never asks to go to the bathroom any more.\u201d\nColau is unequivocal about the cause: a lockdown that has left children in Spain confined to their homes longer \u2013 and under stricter conditions \u2013 than any other country in Europe.\n\u201cWe have spent more than a month at home with two small children, who haven\u2019t left home for even one single day,\u201d said Colau. \u201cThese children need to get out.\u201d\nThe leftwing mayor is equally as clear about the remedy: \u201cWait no longer: Free our children!\u201d Colau urged on social media last week. Politicians of all stripes have echoed her call, as have hundreds of doctors, psychologists and educators, citing concerns about children\u2019s ability to manage issues such as anxiety and stress while being kept entirely indoors.\nThe Spanish government plunged the country into a near-total lockdown on 14 March, ordering most residents to remain at home at all times, allowed out individually and only for short trips to buy food, medicine, or to walk the dog. Save for a few exceptions \u2013 such as children with special educational needs or single-parent families \u2013 minors are to remain in their homes.\nThe stringent measures were unleashed as the country tackled a Covid-19 outbreak that was spreading at one of the fastest rates in the world. Spain has seen one of the world\u2019s highest rates of deaths per million inhabitants, with more than 20,000 people killed as the virus races through the country. Amid concerns that the actual number of deaths caused by the virus could be much higher, the government has said the lockdown is likely to stretch into mid-May.\nRecent days have seen the calls for children to be let out intensify \u2013 particularly after the government relaxed the lockdown to allow some non-essential workers to return to factories and construction sites.\n\u201cWhy do our children have to keep waiting?\u201d Colau asked, arguing parents could be trusted to safely take their children out for walks close to home. \u201cLet\u2019s find a way to do it right and according to the advice of health experts.\u201d\nHer view was echoed by more than 300 professionals who work with children \u2013 from psychologists to paediatricians \u2013 who signed an open letter to the socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\n\u201cThe results of this rigid confinement for children are beginning to show, particularly in urban areas with limited domestic spaces, with increased levels of stress and anxiety,\u201d the letter read, urging that children be let out for at least one hour each day. Not doing so, it added, risks their \u201cwellbeing, their health and their physical and mental development\u201d.\nA further warning came from the Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity, which estimated that the lockdown could see a 5% weight gain in children and adolescents, adding to an obesity rate that already ranks among the highest in Europe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only country in Europe that doesn\u2019t let children out,\u201d said Heike Freire, the psychologist behind an online petition calling for children to be allowed outside, which has received more than 54,000 signatures. \u201cChildren here have spent 34 days without stepping out on to the street.\u201d\nIn France and Belgium children are allowed out of their homes for one hour each day within a limited distance. After weeks of total confinement, most Italian authorities now allow minors out for a walk close to home, accompanied by one parent. Last week, Denmark reopened its primary schools and kindergartens, while Norway plans to follow suit later this month.\nCampaigners argue that the situation is particularly acute in Spain, where the dense layers of apartment buildings that sprawl across cities have left many of the country\u2019s nearly seven million children without direct access to fresh air or sunlight. \u201cApproximately 70% of Spanish families with children live in apartments, many of them 50-70 sq metres and without balconies,\u201d said Freire.\nThe Spanish government has so far fended off any push to relax the rules, advising caution in a country where multi-generational families are common. \u201cThe measures \u2013 some of the strictest in Europe \u2013 are out of prudence, as children are a vector of transmission,\u201d Salvador Illa, the country\u2019s health minister told reporters last week. His government was monitoring the epidemiological data to decide when it would be safe to allow children outside, he added.\nThose who work with children say they have already seen a rise in anxiety issues. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more children with nervousness, more with insomnia, more with chest and stomach pains,\u201d said Madrid paediatrician Alicia Ar\u00e9valo.\nShe stressed, however, that these cases were a minority. \u201cI have families telling me that they\u2019re rebuilding relationships now that day-to-day life has calmed,\u201d she said, citing adolescents who said they were speaking more to their parents or engaging in more family time with activities such as baking or painting.\nThat may be the case for some children, said Freire. But she warned against any generalisation, noting that the situation risks exacerbating existing inequalities. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare a child that lives in a 600 sq metre house with a backyard with a child that lives in a 30- or 50-sq metre apartment without a balcony,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare parents who have no economic problems with children whose parents have been temporarily laid off, or who have lost their jobs.\u201d\nShe argued that the issue was fundamentally one of human rights. \u201cBy law, children have the right to fresh air, sunlight, movement, play and contact with other children,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my view, a society that doesn\u2019t put its children ahead of everything \u2013 that doesn\u2019t ensure their needs are met \u2013 is sliding back towards barbarism. It\u2019s completely inhumane.\u201d",

        "content": "FDA fast-tracked new guidance to ease restrictions against gay men but most blood banks haven\u2019t yet applied the revision\nWhen Lukus Estok recovered from a traumatic case of Covid-19 that sent him to hospital, he tried to donate his plasma for an experimental treatment that could help critically ill coronavirus patients.\nThe 36-year-old New Yorker spent hours applying to donate at one of the New York Blood Center\u2019s Manhattan locations, answering questions online, passing medical tests and completing phone screenings.\nHe finally attended an appointment last week, but as soon as a worker there  learned he was gay, her face turned cold. He couldn\u2019t donate, she told him.\n\u201cI was just so angry and so embarrassed at the way that that was handled, and I just didn\u2019t see it coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I should have.\u201d\nGay and bisexual men in the US had been subject to blanket bans on donating blood since Aids devastated the LGBTQ+ community in the 1980s, because of what health experts have called \u201cdiscriminatory practices based on outdated stereotypes\u201d. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its guidance but still required men to abstain from sex with another man for at least a year before they could give blood, a policy that the the American Public Health Association said was \u201cnot based in science\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very long struggle to try to get them to just simply adapt and include the current science in the policy,\u201d said Scott Schoettes, counsel and HIV project director at Lambda Legal, a civil rights organization.\nUnder pressure from lawmakers and in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has ravaged parts of the US and forced thousands of blood drives to cancel, the FDA fast-tracked new guidance in early April to further ease the restriction to three months.\nIf the recommendations are implemented early, the FDA said, they could \u201chelp to address\u201d the US\u2019s \u201csignificant shortage\u201d in blood amid a crisis.\nHowever, administrative conflicts and hurdles have meant most blood banks haven\u2019t yet applied the revision, despite the FDA\u2019s go-ahead. Kate Fry, the chief executive at America\u2019s Blood Centers, estimated it will take two to three months, on average, for blood centers to update their practices and welcome gay and bisexual men who meet the new criteria.\nFry cited a slew of upgrades \u2013 to the computer system, training processes, manuals, donor education items and a universal donor history questionnaire \u2013 that \u201cunfortunately just does take some time\u201d to incorporate.\n\u201cI am not aware of any blood center who has made any changes yet. It\u2019s just far too early,\u201d Fry said.\nThe American Red Cross similarly said it was \u201cworking aggressively to implement the many eligibility changes outlined by the FDA as soon as possible\u201d, but had not done so yet.\nA spokesperson for the New York Blood Center did not respond specifically to Estok\u2019s allegations of being treated as \u201cless than\u201d but echoed its industry peers. It said it is \u201cpleased with this new guidance\u201d and \u201cworking to implement the changes as quickly as possible\u201d.\nFor some men who are suddenly eligible, that isn\u2019t quick enough.\nBrennon Mendez, a 24-year-old student at Yale Law School, felt \u201cecstatic\u201d after he heard about the FDA update.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to donate blood for my entire adult life, and the current blood shortage caused by Covid-19 made that desire that much more urgent,\u201d he said.\nOn the day the guidance was published, Mendez immediately made an appointment at the UCI Health Blood Donor Center in Orange, California. But when he got there, he was turned away, much like Estok.\nMendez said the receptionist told him the clinic wasn\u2019t yet complying with the new FDA guidance.\n\u201cI felt stigmatized, and I also felt outraged that such a refusal to adapt to the urgent circumstances of this crisis would result in less blood being available to those who need it most,\u201d Mendez said.\n\u201cThe numerous steps that exist to ensure the safety of the blood supply\u201d, such as updating procedures and retraining staff, aren\u2019t meant to marginalize anyone, John Murray, assistant director for media and public relations at UCI Health, said in a statement.\nBefore the California site can start complying with recent guidance, Murray added, the AABB, a standard-setting association in charge of the donor history questionnaire used by donor centers across the country, needs FDA approval for a revised version of that document.\nBut Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the FDA, contradicted Murray. He said licensed blood facilities do not have to wait on any association\u2019s revised donor questionnaire. They can instead come up with their own materials and implement the changes now.\nThe nation\u2019s blood supply has stabilized since the pandemic\u2019s early days, Fry said, though there was still an ongoing need for donations. But Schoettes\u2019s larger concern was around people such as Estok, who have blood rich in coronavirus antibodies that could be used to possibly counteract the virus\u2019s devastating effects on the country\u2019s most vulnerable patients.\n\u201cWe need to continue to push because there is a more urgent need there, and I don\u2019t think we necessarily need to be patient on that front,\u201d Schoettes said.\nA few days ago, a member of Estok\u2019s gospel choir reached out to him for help. The man told Estok he knew someone who hoped to try the plasma treatment but had to wait because there weren\u2019t enough donations.\nEstok couldn\u2019t do anything for that family, or for anyone else, even though he wants to desperately.\n\u201cTo know that I\u2019m healthy, to know that I\u2019m a candidate \u2013 like a solid candidate \u2013 for donation, but I can\u2019t because \u2026 I don\u2019t know, they can\u2019t get an IT guy in to fix their computers?\u201d Estok said. \u201cThat\u2019s so hard for me to wrap my head around.\u201d",

In the last 24 hours, there have been 73 new coronavirus deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 5,031, the health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour told state TV.\nThe daily death toll was one of the lowest in recent days, he said, adding that the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country had reached 80,868.\nAccording to a parliamentary report released earlier this week, the coronavirus death toll might be almost double the figure announced by the health ministry, and the number of infections eight to 10 times higher. Iran is the worst-affected country in the Middle East, with one of the world\u2019s highest coronavirus-related death tolls.\nHundreds of Taiwanese navy sailors quarantined\nAbout 700 Taiwanese navy sailors are being put in quarantine after three Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a goodwill mission to the Pacific island state of Palau, the country\u2019s government has announced.\nThree Taiwan navy vessels visited Palau \u2013 an archipelago of islands which was under US administration until its independence in 1994 and is one of only 15 countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan \u2013 in the middle of March and returned to Taiwan a month later, Chen Shih-chung, the health minister, said.",

Family members are expected to video call her on the day.\nIn London, salutes are traditionally fired from the Tower of London and Hyde Park on the Queen\u2019s birthday.\nThe basic salute is 21 rounds, fired at 10-second intervals. In Hyde Park, a royal park, there are an extra 20 rounds, making it a 41-gun salute. It is usually fired at midday by the King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery from six 13-pounder guns, which are pulled at speed by teams of horses over the grass. The guns are quickly detached to fire booming blanks which send a puff of white smoke into the air.\nThe salute at the Tower of London is usually fired from four 25-pounder guns located on Tower Wharf facing the River Thames, by the Honourable Artillery Company, at 1pm.\nThis year there is also no obligation for government buildings and town halls to fly the union flag at full mast, as is also traditional on the Queen\u2019s birthday.\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has written to state buildings giving the standard advice on flag-flying protocol.

We cannot afford to risk losing any more. Just yesterday the health and social care secretary said he could not guarantee that hospitals would not run out this weekend,\u201d Nagpaul added.\nAt least 56 NHS workers have died from coronavirus. The actual number of health workers to have lost their lives is likely to be higher, as not all deaths will be in the public domain.",

In March, the company asked landlords for rent cuts and paused payments into its pension scheme.\nThe potential closures are not believed to be centred on any particular brands and the number of stores that could be affected has not been confirmed. All of the group\u2019s 550 stores across the UK are closed as the coronavirus lockdown measures, which could last until June, prevent Britons from shopping for anything other than food and essential needs.\nLike other retailers, Arcadia is facing financial turmoil and earlier this month said 14,500 of its 16,000 employees would be furloughed and apply to the government\u2019s emergency wage scheme.\nBut the retail group had been hit by financial troubles before the Covid-19 crisis. Its high street brands reported pre-tax losses of \u00a3505.1m for the year to September 2018, according to accounts published on Companies House.\nA series of company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) were proposed in May last year as part of a wider three-year recovery plan, which led to the closures of 23 stores and rent slashes on many others.\nUnder the rescue deal, the group\u2019s US operations went into administration and an additional 25 Evans and Miss Selfridge stores were closed.\nOn Friday, the department store retailer Debenhams confirmed the closure of seven shops with the loss of more than 422 jobs after going into administration last week.\nMeanwhile, the struggling fashion chains Oasis and Warehouse collapsed into administration, putting 2,300 jobs at risk.\nArcadia declined to comment.",

        "content": "PDC\u2019s commendable new idea, in which stars of the game play from their own homes, is undone by nonexistent production values, shonky wifi and a total absence of atmosphere\nThrew the Keyhole. One of several tricks missed by the Professional Darts Corporation as it brought competitive sport to the bored masses on Friday night, the failure to name its new tournament in homage to the game show that invites viewers to snoop around the houses of unidentified celebrities seemed a comparatively minor oversight by the end of an opening evening that featured more missed notes than doubles.\nOn the face of it, Darts at Home is a terrific idea. With sports fans already tired of watching bored footballers juggling toilet roll on social media, the PDC hit upon the wheeze of staging a competition with upwards of 130 of the world\u2019s elite tungsten titans facing each other from the sanctuary of their own houses. To paraphrase the former oche announcer Martin Fitzmaurice: \u201cLets \u2026 play \u2026 socially \u2026 responsible \u2026 darts!\u201d\nOn consecutive nights for the next month, groups of four players will take each other on in a series of round robins with the winners advancing to the next stage. Viewers are invited into their homes by watching live and free of charge on the PDC website. Audience fancy dress and bawdy inebriation is optional but tacitly encouraged.\nWith mass gatherings banned and physical distancing in force, raucous evenings of televised arena arrows are on hold and so it came to pass that the inaugural Darts at Home match was won in understated silence by the world champion, Peter Wright. Playing in his East Anglian home\u2019s dedicated practice room, he clinched victory by the odd leg of nine against Peter Jacques, who was throwing in the marital bedroom of his home in the West Yorkshire village of Denby Dale. In the following matchup, the evening\u2019s eventual winner, Jamie Lewis, playing in his spare room in Wales, was seen off by Niels Zonneveld from the Netherlands.\nIt was all good in theory, even if the games were too long and coverage might have been greatly improved by some audience interaction through social media. The screen was split so each player\u2019s board was on view, while the PDC\u2019s often pixelated and occasionally frozen Dan Dawson kept score and provided occasional commentary from a Birmingham bunker.\nWith the host streaming company apparently oblivious, coverage went live 20 minutes before the first game, capturing an unwitting Dawson puffing on an E-cigarette as the players were asked not to smoke or swear. Meanwhile in the House that Darts Built, Wright could be seen uncorking a bottle of fine wine ahead of his evening\u2019s endeavours.\nWhile darts may well have paid for Wright\u2019s well-appointed domicile, it seems to have stopped short of springing for decent wifi. The world champion is fabled for his colourful mohawk hairstyle and the NHS logo on one side of his shaved head was a clearly visible and heartwarming touch. His dartboard, however, remained a distant blur of seeping yellows, greens and reds, while viewers could hear his projectiles hit it long before they saw them.\nWith production values at the bare minimum, there were none of the usual closeups to which TV viewers have long been accustomed, this tournament proving a victim of its organisers\u2019 famously slick and comparatively big-budget successes, while in the absence of an announcer, players had to call their own scores. Indeed, the absence of any kind of atmosphere, some staggeringly low three-dart averages and the paucity of 180 maximums meant viewers could have been forgiven for thinking they were watching one of the more well-attended tournaments organised by the PDC\u2019s unloved rival, the BDO.\nWhile Wright, Zonneveld and Jacques went out of the tournament at the first time of asking, their exits were fairly low-key compared to that of Gary Anderson. On Friday afternoon, Sky Sports News solemnly announced the former world champion had been forced to withdraw from the tournament due to the insufficient strength of the broadband in his Somerset home.\nMeanwhile in Northern Ireland, Daryl Gurney excused himself in the interests of promoting domestic harmony, explaining that his home setup involved him having to stand in an upstairs corridor with one leg inside the bathroom in a state of affairs that would preclude any of his immediate family from using the toilet.\nA commendable idea in theory but ultimately dissatisfying in execution, Darts At Home did little more than demonstrate just how integral the contributions of dancing cheerleaders, gregarious announcers and an inebriated audience roaring bawdily along to Planet Funk\u2019s Chase The Sun are to the televised theatre of the arrow experience. Through no great fault of its organisers, it was conspicuously poorer in the absence of those bells and whistles \u2013 more bus fare home than the speedboat or caravan we could have won.",

        "content": "Handling of Chinese nationals trying to flee Russia has created strains between allies as they boast of new \u2018strategic partnership\u2019\nAs soon as Jie Zhongfeng learned about her roommate who recently returned to China contracting Covid-19, she booked a flight from Moscow to Vladivostok in Russia\u2019s Far East and paid another 300 yuan (about $42) to schedule a bus ride to the Chinese border city of Suifenhe.\nDressed in full-body protective suit, masks and gloves, Jie did not eat or drink for more than 20 hours during her journey for fear of infection.\n\u201cAfter my roommate was confirmed to be infected, I became so scared. I decided to come back to China at once\u2026 I only felt safe after I crossed the border into China,\u201d said Jie, a 54-year-old who sold shoes for more than 15 years in one of the wholesale markets in eastern Moscow\u2019s Lyublino district. Jie wanted to return home because if she had already been infected, she believed she could receive better medical treatment in China because she wouldn\u2019t have trouble communicating with the doctors.\nShe was among the more than 2,000 Chinese nationals who crossed the land border checkpoint at Suifenhe before it was shut on 7 April.\nThe influx of Chinese nationals returning from Moscow has turned the sleepy border town, which has a population of 70,000, into China\u2019s new Covid-19 hotspot.\nAccording to a statement from the Chinese consulate in Vladivostok on Thursday, a total of 346 Chinese nationals returning from Moscow through Suifenhe contracted Covid-19. The total number of imported cases in China stood at 1,534 as of Thursday, figures from China\u2019s National Health Commission showed.\nIn response, local authorities in Suifenhe introduced strict lockdown measures, shutting down all residential communities in the city, allowing only one person from each household to go out and buy basic necessities once every three days.\nAt the same time, similar to the response in Wuhan, medical teams from other Chinese cities were sent to offer assistance. China\u2019s state press has called the effort \u201ca battle to defend Suifenhe\u201d.\nAfter Jie crossed the border at Suifenhe, she was given a Covid-19 test at the arrival hall. Her test came back negative the next morning and she was sent to a designated hotel in the city of Mudanjiang, about 90 miles (140km) to the west, for a 14-day mandatory quarantine.\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to leave my hotel room. I\u2019m only allowed to open the door when they deliver food to me,\u201d she said.\nWhile Jie crossed the border at Suifenhe before its closure, at least 330 Chinese nationals were stranded on the other side.\nChina and Russia have both boasted of their \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d amid growing tensions with the west, but the exodus of Chinese nationals has strained relations along the border.\nEarlier this month local authorities in Primorsky Krai, the region bordering China, said they planned to send 330 stranded Chinese nationals back to China. But after the Chinese consulate in Vladivostock issued a statement calling the announcement \u201cinaccurate\u201d and said the border would remain closed Primorsky Krai officials removed the announcement from their website. Still, the local governor has called for a halt on Chinese nationals travelling from Moscow to Vladivostok.\n\u201cThe shutdown of borders between the two countries has demonstrated the awkward situation China faces when dealing with an ally like Russia,\u201d said Wu Qiang, an independent scholar formerly at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.\n\u201cThe decision to close the borders came from Beijing\u2019s concerns over growing domestic complaints that Russia had become the top source of imported Covid-19 cases in China,\u201d Wu said.\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said that during a phone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping, Russian president Vladimir Putin praised \u201cconsistent and effective actions\u201d of the Chinese \u201cwhich allowed the epidemiological situation in the country to stabilise\u201d.\nScholars say Beijing likely does not want to emphasise that a growing number of imported Covid-19 cases are coming from one of its most closest partners and both sides appear willing to downplay the unease at the border.\n\u201cThis is an unpleasant situation. It\u2019s a nuisance of course. But I don\u2019t see any rupture of bilateral relations coming from this particular situation,\u201d said Artyom Lukin, an international relations scholar at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Russia.\n\u201cI might sound cynical. But these are just ordinary people. They\u2019re not like the daughter of (Chinese technology giant) Huawei\u2019s founder. They\u2019re mostly traders and students. Cynically speaking, the Russia-China strategic partnership can easily sacrifice the interests of a few hundred ordinary people.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had more time, I would definitely move the shoes to safer places. But my life and health were more important,\u201d she said.\nSince she left Jie has had to pay about 300,000 rubles (about $4,040) in rent each month for her apartment and her stall at the market.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll open the market again. But if I\u2019m healthy when they reopen, I\u2019ll definitely try to come back to Moscow. If the virus doesn\u2019t kill us, we all have to make money to live our lives,\u201d she said.",

About 2,000 people attend prayers each day. Volunteers cram into its kitchen to prepare iftar, the meal that breaks the Ramadan fast at sunset, for 300 people each night.\nNot this year. \u201cWe will miss all that,\u201d said Mohammed Kozbar, the mosque\u2019s general secretary. The building\u2019s gates are locked, with only security guards patrolling its prayer halls and community spaces. \u201cI visited last week. It was heartbreaking to see it empty and silent,\u201d said Kozbar.\nThe world\u2019s 1.8bn Muslims are facing the most important period of the Islamic year, the holy month of Ramadan, which starts this week, under lockdown because of the global coronavirus pandemic.\nMosques in most countries are shut and gatherings forbidden. The holy sites of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are under curfew. The al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City are closed and prayers suspended.\nIn the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for the suspension of all congregational activities at mosques and Islamic centres on 16 March, a week before the government announced all places of worship must close under the lockdown order.\nOn Friday, the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board said Islamic buildings would remain closed during Ramadan until the lockdown is lifted. \u201cIt would be deemed extremely irresponsible to congregate for night prayers or hold religious gatherings during this Ramadan in any mosque or houses with people who are not members of the immediate household,\u201d said Qari Asim, a Leeds imam and chair of the board.\n\u201cDuring the epidemic, the desire to perform prayers with a congregation in a mosque comes second to saving lives.\u201d\nFor Muslims, to be unable to take part in congregational prayers and break the fast with family and friends during Ramadan was \u201cemotionally challenging, frustrating and culturally alien\u201d, he added.\nShelina Janmohamed, the author of Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World and vice-president of Islamic marketing at Ogilvy Consulting, said: \u201cThis is going to be the most unusual Ramadan of my lifetime and I think in the living memory of Muslims across the UK.\u201d\nThe Islamic holy month was \u201ca time of togetherness and spiritual congregation. Those are the two anchors [of Ramadan], and built into that is a nostalgia around traditions and rituals. Even those who might not normally classify themselves as observant Muslims feel drawn to Ramadan because those feelings of togetherness and community are built into us from childhood.\u201d\nLike other faiths, Muslims are using technology to meet the challenges of lockdown. Ramadan prayers and the nightly recitation of the Qur\u2019an will move online, and fundraising for charities will also be digital. Platforms such as Zoom are expected to host iftar parties.\nGuidance is being drawn up by Islamic scholars on exemptions from fasting for people who are vulnerable to coronavirus. Muslims working long shifts in essential services will \u201cneed to be pragmatic in their approach\u201d to fasting, said Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB.\n\u201cThis Ramadan will be at a slower pace. It will give us more time for reflection and the opportunity to be closer to God,\u201d he said. Instead of visiting different mosques every day, Khan will be spending Ramadan at home with his immediate family.\nAccording to Asim: \u201cThere is likely to be a tiny group of zealous people who may try to organise iftar events or congregational night prayers in their homes. My message to them is that selfishness has no place with God.\u201d\nHe also warned that extreme rightwing groups were \u201ctrying to use the pandemic to create division\u201d and were scapegoating Muslims for the spread of the virus.\nAt Finsbury Park mosque, there are plans to distribute iftar meals to people in need or alone who would normally come in person. \u201cPeople who volunteer with us every Ramadan are calling to say, \u2018Please, how can we help?\u2019,\u201d said Kozbar.\nThe mosque will be streaming lectures and prayers, offering online counselling and organising members to take food to staff at nearby hospitals. \u201cThis lockdown is something new for us, like everyone else. It\u2019s a very difficult time, but we want to do our bit.\u201d",

        "content": "Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s chief of staff dies and 20 people close to Ashraf Ghani test positive\nCovid-19 has moved closer to the heart of government in Nigeria, where the president\u2019s chief of staff has died, and Afghanistan, where the president is in near-isolation after at least 20 officials who work with him reportedly contracted the virus from a contaminated document.\nAbba Kyari was the top official aide to Muhammadu Buhari and one of the most powerful men in Nigeria. Like Buhari, he was in his 70s, and he had underlying health conditions, including diabetes.\nPresidential spokespeople confirmed Kyari\u2019s death on Twitter, as deaths across Africa passed 1,000 and experts said the continent was badly prepared for an outbreak. Ten countries have no ventilators at all, the New York Times reported.\nIn the US, Donald Trump\u2019s administration was accused of a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d over the slow expansion of coronavirus testing. Angus King, the independent senator for Maine, reportedly vented his frustration to the vice-president, Mike Pence.\n\u201cI have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,\u201d King reportedly said during the conversation. The White House has pushed back at widespread criticism that the US lacks the testing capacity to end lockdowns and reopen its economy.\nKing\u2019s comments came hours after Trump posted incendiary tweets that potentially stoked protests against physical distancing and stay-at-home measures in three states led by Democratic governors.\nIn Spain, the second-worst affected country by number of infections, but with fewer deaths than Italy, the death toll passed 20,000 on Saturday, after 565 new fatalities were recorded in 24 hours. The rate of increase slowed slightly, bolstering hope the country may be bringing its outbreak under control.\nOn China\u2019s borders, North Korean authorities have confirmed for the first time that they have seen cases of the disease, Radio Free Asia reported. The infections were revealed in public lectures, but no numbers were given.\nPyongyang tried to seal itself off entirely in the early days of the pandemic, closing its borders and flying dozens of foreign diplomats out of the country in March. The country is one of many where weak public health infrastructure has led to fears that an outbreak of the coronavirus could prove devastating.\nAfghanistan is another, because of a fragile health network and minimal social welfare provisions. Many people say they have to work or they will starve, and although physical distancing has been ordered, it is often observed only loosely. There have been 33 deaths so far.\nThe country\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, has cut back almost all contact with staff, working digitally and meeting only a close inner circle in person, after officials who work at the presidential palace tested positive for the disease.\nThe virus is thought to have arrived via a contaminated document delivered from another department, a senior health official told Reuters.\nGhani, 70, has had serious gastrointestinal health problems in the past, making him potentially more vulnerable to the coronavirus if he catches it.\nThe pandemic comes at a particularly difficult time for the country, with Ghani still locked in a dispute over the results of last year\u2019s presidential election, trying to start peace talks with the Taliban after Washington agreed a withdrawal deal, and grappling with fallout from a major reduction in US aid.\nThere are also concerns about the impact of coronavirus across Africa. The continent has so far suffered less than other regions, recording nearly 17,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Limited testing in many countries, however, may have deprived officials of a full picture of the disease\u2019s spread.\nThe IMF and World Bank have appealed for rapid international action to help African countries respond to the pandemic that will cause the continent\u2019s economy to shrink by 1.25% in 2020, the worst reading on record.\nKyari, who acted as a gatekeeper to Buhari, is among the most high-profile victims in the region. Nigeria has recorded 493 confirmed cases and 17 deaths so far, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.\nOther developments around the world include:\nThe US president said protesters who flouted physical distancing measures \u201cseem to be very responsible people\u201d, when commenting on demonstrations against stay-at-home orders. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and confederate flags, and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms.\nTrump again cast doubt on China\u2019s death toll, which was revised up on Friday, and said \u201ca lot of strange things are happening\u201d regarding the origins of the coronavirus.\nGermany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 3,609 to 137,439, data from the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases showed on Saturday, marking a fourth straight day of a rise in infections.\nAustralia\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 rose to 68 on Saturday, with 6,533 infections.\nTwelve Guatemalan migrants on deportation flight from the US tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe Kurdish-led administration in north-east Syria said the World Health Organization had found the area\u2019s first case of coronavirus earlier this month after samples were tested in Damascus.\nAll airline passengers in Canada will be required to wear non-medical masks or face coverings during travel to curb the spread of coronavirus.\nMexico\u2019s president said Trump had promised Mexico would be able to buy 1,000 ventilators and other intensive-therapy equipment used in treating severe cases of Covid-19.\nChina reported that 27 new coronavirus cases were confirmed on Friday, of which 17 were linked to foreign travel. No new fatalities were recorded.",

        "content": "Preserved cargoes of vessels linking eastern cultures with western Europe show \u2018the barbarian Orient\u2019 was a trendsetter \nFor almost seven decades archaeologists have searched the eastern Mediterranean in vain for wrecks that sank along antiquity\u2019s mighty shipping lanes.\nNow, though, a British-led team can reveal a spectacular discovery \u2013 a fleet of Hellenistic, Roman, early Islamic and Ottoman wrecks that were lost some two kilometres below the waves of the Levantine Basin between the 3rd century BC and the 19th century.\nSean Kingsley, director of the Centre for East-West Maritime Exploration and archaeologist for the Enigma Shipwrecks Project (ESP), told the Observer: \u201cThis is truly ground-breaking, one the most incredible discoveries under the Mediterranean.\u201d\nThe ESP\u2019s ambitious underwater exploration used cutting-edge remote and robotic technology to research and record the finds, some of which could rewrite history, according to the experts involved.\nOne of the wrecks is a 17th-century Ottoman merchant ship, described as \u201can absolute colossus\u201d, which was so big two normal-sized ships could have fitted on its deck. Its vast cargo has hundreds of artefacts from 14 cultures and civilisations, including the earliest Chinese porcelain retrieved from a Mediterranean wreck, painted jugs from Italy and peppercorns from India. ESP say the ship reveals a previously unknown maritime silk and spice route running from China to Persia, the Red Sea and into the eastern Mediterranean.\nThe ship, which is thought to have sunk around 1630, while sailing between Egypt and Istanbul, is a time-capsule that tells the story of the beginning of the globalised world, Kingsley said: \u201cThe goods and belongings of the 14 cultures and civilisations discovered, spanning on one side of the globe China, India, the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, and to the west North Africa, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, are remarkably cosmopolitan for pre-modern shipping of any era.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAt 43 metres long and with a 1,000-ton burden, it is one of the most spectacular examples of maritime technology and trade in any ocean. Its size is matched by the breadth of its cargoes.\u201d\nThe Chinese porcelain includes 360 decorated cups, dishes and a bottle made in the kilns of Jingdezhen during the reign of Chongzhen, the last Ming emperor that were designed for sipping tea, but the Ottomans adapted them for the craze then spreading across the East \u2013 coffee drinking. Hidden deep in the hold were the earliest Ottoman clay tobacco pipes found on land or sea. They were probably illicit because there were severe prohibitions then against tobacco smoking.\nKingsley said: \u201cThrough tobacco smoking and coffee drinking in Ottoman cafes, the idea of recreation and polite society \u2013 hallmarks of modern culture \u2013 came to life. Europe may think it invented notions of civility, but the wrecked coffee cups and pots prove the \u2018barbarian Orient\u2019 was a trailblazer rather than a backwater. The first London coffeehouse only opened its doors in 1652, a century after the Levant.\u201d\nSteven Vallery, co-director of Enigma, said: \u201cIn the Levantine Basin, the Enigma wrecks lie beyond any country\u2019s territory. All the remains were carefully recorded using a suite of digital photography, HD video, photomosaics and multibeams. For science and underwater exploration, these finds are a giant leap forward.\u201d\nThe last phase of Enigma\u2019s fieldwork was carried out at the end of 2015, with the post-excavation process continuing for years after and remaining unpublicised until now. Some of the recovered artefacts are being held in Cyprus, from where the archaeologists worked. Initial concerns that the site was in Cypriot waters have been disproved, Kingsley said, and the Enigma team now hopes the entire collection will go on permanent exhibition in a major public museum.",

Claudia Mo said Beijing was also trying to \u201dterrorise Hong Kong opposition\u201d ahead of the legislative council election in September.\nThe veteran China watcher, Johnny Lau, said Beijing is trying to hit hard at Hong Kong while the world is busy dealing with Covid-19.\n\u201cIn Xi Jinping\u2019s eyes this is an opportunity to shuffle the cards and to assert its narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the foreign countries turn a blind eye and fail to rein in [China\u2019s power], they would also suffer.\u201d\nThe arrests came just hours after China\u2019s liaison office asserted in a strongly-worded statement that it and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) \u2013 China\u2019s top bodies overseeing the city\u2019s affairs \u2013 are \u201cauthorised by the central authorities to handle Hong Kong affairs.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the liason office\u2019s chief, Luo Huining, called for controversial national security laws to be urgently passed as accusations of overreach by Beijing into the city\u2019s legislative council and judiciary escalate.\nHong Kong was promised a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d for at least 50 years after China resumed control in 1997, under the Sino-British joint declaration. The city\u2019s post-handover mini-constitution, the Basic Law, bars the mainland Chinese government from interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and article 22 states that no department under the Chinese central and local governments \u201cmay interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong special administrative region administers on its own in accordance with this law.\u201d\nBut the liaison office statement, published late on Friday, asserts that \u201ca high degree of autonomy is not complete autonomy.\u201d It stresses that Hong Kong\u2019s right to self-rule is \u201cauthorised by the central government.\u201d\nThe statement argues that the liaison office and the HKMAO \u201care not what is referred to in article 22 of the Basic Law, or what is commonly understood to be \u2018departments under the central people\u2019s government\u2019.\u201d It adds that the offices derive their authority both from China\u2019s constitution and the Basic Law.\nThis week, pro-democracy lawmakers accused the Chinese government of \u201cblatant intervention\u201d and violation of article 22 of the Basic Law after the HKMAO said some lawmakers were guilty of misconduct in public office for delaying bills, failing to appoint a House committee chairman and paralysing the legislature by filibustering.\nThe liaison office statement said people who made such allegations were distorting the Basic Law and misleading public opinion, adding that \u201cloyalty to the country is a necessary requirement\u201d for lawmakers.\nChina law expert Prof Jerome Cohen at the New York University descibed China\u2019s statement is \u201castounding and incendiary\u201d.\n\u201cIf taken seriously, it collapses the whole one country, two systems edifice that was constructed over so many years since the joint declaration,\u201d he said.\nProf Michael Davis, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said China\u2019s aggressive language would \u201cresult in further pushback\u201d from Hong Kong society, which has already experienced its most severe political crisis.\n\u201cThe danger is that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy will be squandered and this has implications for all countries that have relied on the promises made to Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fear that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy will be lost, along with it the rule of law, is what has driven the many protests in Hong Kong and international concern.\u201d\nAlvin Cheung, a legal scholar specialising in Hong Kong issues at New York University, said: \u201c[The fact that] Beijing is not even pretending to keep up appearances heralds a dark new stage in Hong Kong\u2019s post-1997 development \u2026 It suggests repression will intensify further.\u201d\nA Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesperson said in a statement that the UK government was concerned about the arrests and stressed that the right to peaceful protest was \u201cprotected in both the joint declaration and the Basic Law\u201d.\n\u201cIt is essential that any protests are conducted peacefully, and that the authorities avoid actions that inflame tensions. The authorities should focus on rebuilding trust through a process of meaningful political dialogue,\u201d the statement said.\nChris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, said while the world\u2019s attention is focused on the covid-19 epidemic, Beijing has taken \u201cyet another step towards burying one-country, two-system\u201d and the arrests show that \u201cBeijing is determined to throttle Hong Kong\u201d.\nHe said the liaison office\u2019s claim that it is not bound by the basic law is \u201ca reckless argument which shows that Xi Jinping is determined to abandon the policies pursued by his predecessors, even at the cost of destroying Hong Kong\u2019s way of life\u201d.\n\u201cIt should be rejected immediately by all those governments and parliaments around the world who know the importance of safe-guarding the high degree of autonomy which is guaranteed by the Basic Law.\u201d\nLee, often dubbed the \u201cFather of Democracy\u201d in Hong Kong and a drafter of the Basic Law, said after he was released on bail that he had \u201cno regrets\u201d and felt \u201cproud to walk the road of democracy with the outstanding youths in Hong Kong\u201d.",

And that the healing\u00a0can start from these games.\u00a0#FreeNazanin\nReleased originally for two weeks with an ankle-tag as a result of a major outbreak of coronavirus in Iran, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s leave was due to end on Saturday. It has been extended once before.\n\u201cWe are waiting on news tomorrow,\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told PA Media.\nKate Allen, Amnesty International UK\u2019s director, said: \u201c[The news] that Nazanin and her family must wait another day in limbo for a decision is deeply disappointing.\n\u201cThere should be no question of her being sent back to Evin Prison \u2013 not in a few weeks\u2019 time, not ever.

We are seeing known corrupters use this time, when players are on social media more than ever, to connect with them and try to build a relationship that they can exploit at a later date.\n\u201cWe have reached out to our members, players and their wider networks to highlight this issue and ensure they all continue to be aware of the dangers of approaches and do not let their guard down while there is no cricket being played.\u201d\nAs well as players spending more time interacting with fans on social media at present, Marshall\u2019s team are mindful the drop in income could make some of the less well-paid professionals more vulnerable.\nJames Pyemont, the ECB\u2019s head of integrity, added: \u201cThere will always be someone to make something out of a crisis and view it as an opportunity. We have to be confident we can withstand that pressure and we\u2019re confident our players will do the right thing. The time is now to show this is a robust system.\u201d\nApril would typically be a quiet month for the ICC\u2019s anti-corruption team, with no international cricket staged and the IPL \u2013 now suspended indefinitely \u2013 policed by India\u2019s in-house anti-corruption unit since last year.\nThe investigative work continues, however, and a number of cases are expected to be progressed in the coming weeks. These are believed to include the three United Arab Emirates players \u2013 Mohammed Naveed, Qadeer Ahmed and Shaiman Anwar \u2013 who were charged with a combined 13 counts of breaching anti-corruption rules last October.\nMarshall revealed in January that his team was looking into 50 cases of potential wrongdoing in the sport \u2013 including intelligence gathered during last year\u2019s World Cup in the UK \u2013 and sifts through around 1,000 pieces of evidence a year.\nShakib Al Hasan is the most high-profile cricketer serving a ban under the ICC\u2019s anti-corruption code, with the Bangladesh captain accepting three charges of failing to report approaches from Deepak Aggarwal, a suspected bookmaker, last October.\nA veteran of 338 international appearances, Shakib engaged in Whatsapp conversations with Aggarwal before matches in the Bangladesh Premier League, an international tri-series and the IPL between 2017 and 2018, but denied passing on inside information.\nA two-year ban, with 12 months of it suspended, was the result, meaning Shakib is free to resume his playing career on 29 October.",

While the government estimated this week that the death toll inside care homes stood at 1,400, the care sector\u2019s leading charity warned on Saturday that it could be more than five times higher.\nScotland recorded a further 56 deaths, bringing its total death to 893, according to the Scottish government. In Wales, a further 28 deaths brought the total to 534, Public Health Wales said, and deaths in Northern Ireland also increased by 17 to 193.\nEngland accounts for 13,918 of the UK death toll, following an increase of 784 since Friday. However, NHS England said that the some of the newly recorded deaths occurred as early as 14 March.\nExcluding Northern Ireland, 357,023 people have been tested in the UK, of which 114,217 proved positive. Overall, 460,437 tests have been completed, with 21,389 tests taken on Friday. The discrepancy between the number of tests conducted and the number of people tested can arise from same person being tested more than once, the Department of Health and Social Care said.\nDespite the rising death toll, the rate of transmission within the community was falling, as were hospital admissions, the local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, said at Saturday\u2019s coronavirus briefing.\n\u201cIt is absolutely correct that the hard work, the forbearance, the fortitude of the British public is paying off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rates of transmission in the community are falling, and there\u2019s a number of positive indicators which give us cause for hope, and to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nHe added: \u201cBut nonetheless, the number of deaths that I\u2019ve announced today remains extremely sobering, and more and more of us I think across the country know somebody who has been unwell. More of our lives have been touched by this virus as every day goes by, and I think that just reinforces to us all the need to consider this moment as the one to keep going.\u201d\nHe urged the British public not to \u201close what\u2019s been hard won over the last few weeks\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cKeep adhering to the measures, keep respecting the advice from the clinicians and, if we do that together as a society, then in the weeks to come there may be opportunities to begin very cautiously to ease the lockdown measures.\u201d",

With race income severely curtailed by coronavirus, Horner insists Liberty Media is aware of the risk and would prop up competitors if necessary.\nNine grand prix meetings have been called off this season and with race fees a key source of income, there is genuine concern that smaller teams may not have the resources to survive. F1 fields 10 teams and has no plans for any new entries. Losing even one or two would be a major blow to the world championship.\nThere is no guarantee any races will be held in 2020 and were that the case, Horner says Liberty would act. \u201cIt could be an enormous blow and at that point the promoter has to decide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is their business, they have to decide how do they keep these teams alive because they need teams to go racing. The Liberty guys would do whatever they can to ensure that 10 teams are on the grid and competing next year.\n\u201cIn order to protect their own business I believe they would help to facilitate, which means paying, to ensure that those teams would be around to compete next year.\u201d\nHorner said F1\u2019s ongoing attempts to impose a lower budget cap \u2013 set at $175m in 2021 \u2013 is a misdirection for the sport, which is thinking too conservatively in its short-term efforts to control the damaging effects of the global pandemic. McLaren have argued for a decrease to $100m, while F1\u2019s big three \u2013 Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari \u2013 spend more than $400m annually.\nHorner, however, says that some teams have used the budget cap debate as a chance to push their own agendas. \u201cTeams are competitive beasts, of course they are looking to use an angle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cap is a discussion about competitiveness, not about money. It\u2019s about trying to bring the top teams down to a level where the midfield teams feel they can compete. The reality is that whatever the level of spend there will always be teams that run at the front and teams that run at the back.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the latest meeting failed to reach an agreement, with the idea of a cap of $145m, moving to $130m after a year, on the table. The big three argue their operations and development costs could not be compared with those of smaller teams and Horner insists his team cannot go below $140m. He is in favour of a two-tier cap, but also believes F1 should be more adventurous in considering how to deal with the short-term fiscal threat.\n\u201cIf we were really serious about reducing the cost, particularly for the small teams, I would be in full favour of supplying for the next two years a full customer car,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller teams wouldn\u2019t need any R&D. They would run just as race teams and they would reduce their costs enormously.\u201d\nThe concept of customer cars is at odds with the sport\u2019s character of every team building their own prototypes. This has not always been the case, however, and Horner argued that the sport had to think more radically. \u201cWith the modern 3D photographic technology all teams utilise they are all trying to copy each other\u2019s cars anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes change, things move. F1 used to have customer cars years ago. You could buy a car from March or from Ferrari and go racing.\n\u201cWe need to think out of the box rather than just going round and round, beating ourselves up about numbers. If this is all about saving the little teams and improving their competitiveness, it would be a very difficult to argue against the logic of a small team being able to take a customer car.\u201d",

        "content": "Post-coronavirus production might \u2018snap back\u2019 but we are likely in for a much tougher recovery on the employment front\nThe IMF this week released projections for the world economy over the next two years that were both optimistic and pessimistic.\nWhen the projections were released, I messaged a fellow economics journalist and suggested they were pretty optimistic \u2013 he replied that he hoped they would be correct because they were predicting it would only be the worst downturn since the Great Depression.\nOptimism comes in strange forms these days.\nThe positive outlook of the IMF is that, while they predict Australia\u2019s GDP will fall by 6.7% this year (the worst fall since the Great Depression), they also predict it will rebound next year to rise by 6.1% (the best result since 1984 and second-strongest for 50 years).\nThat assessment suggested the IMF was predicting a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery.\nThere is no real science to any of this, but economists and commentators like to talk about recessions in terms of the shapes of letters.\n\u201cV\u201d means basically an equally sharp fall and recovery, which is the most desired type (if you can desire a recession). A \u201cW\u201d shape is one where the quick recovery is hit with another slump and recovery.\n\u201cU\u201d shape means the economy stays weak for a couple years, and then recovers strongly.\nFinally there is the dreaded \u201cL\u201d shape, in which the economy stays weak for even longer \u2013 five to 10 years of barely enough growth to keep unemployment flat, but not enough to improve things all that much.\nSo for now the IMF (which gets advice from Treasury to formulate its estimates) sees a \u201cV\u201d shaped recovery. And yet not all is good.\nWhile it expects the economy to grow almost as fast in 2021 as it did in 1984, unlike then, it expects the unemployment rate to rise \u2013 from 7.6% this year to 8.9% by the end of next year.\nThis is where the IMF is both optimistic and pessimistic.\nThere is a pretty solid relationship between GDP growth and unemployment (known as Okun\u2019s Law) whereby the faster GDP grows the more the unemployment rate falls.\nOver the past 50 years, we have needed the economy to grow by around 3.2% to keep the unemployment rate steady. In the past 20 years or so this has come down a bit, so now around 3% is good enough.\nAs a general rule, for every 1% that the economy grows above or below 3%, the unemployment rate will fall or rise 0.5%pts.\nSo, for example, given the current unemployment rate is 5.2%, if the economy was to grow by only 2% in a year, you would expect the unemployment rate to rise 0.5%pts to 5.7%.\nUsing the past 50 years as a guide, if the economy was to shrink by 6.7% in a year, as the IMF predicts, then the unemployment rate would be expected to rise by around 4.5%pts \u2013 which would take us up to 9.7%. And yet the IMF predicts unemployment this year to rise only to 7.6%.\nThat is optimistic and takes into account the government\u2019s jobkeeper policy, which will see some people who would normally be classified as unemployed notionally still working.\nBut there the optimism ends.\nWhile the IMF expects the economy to grow by 6.1% in 2021 \u2013 which would normally mean the unemployment rate should fall by around 1.5%pts \u2013 it predicts the unemployment rate to rise another 1.3%pts to 8.9%.\nWhat this means is that while production might \u201csnap back\u201d (to use the prime minister\u2019s phrase) we are likely in for a much tougher recovery on the employment front. Mining production may again ramp up, but labour-heavy sectors like tourism, hospitality and retail will be much slower to return to where we were just three months ago.\nIt means reducing government stimulus will also need to be done with care because while a \u201cV\u201d shape recession is hoped for, rushing the recovery and abruptly cutting stimulus can very easily see the \u201cL\u201d shape become a reality.\nGreg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

I just find myself crying at night thinking what will happen to me if this doesn\u2019t end soon.\u201d\nAlexis (not her real name) arrived in Melbourne from the Philippines in 2019.\nAs one of more than 700,000 international students enrolled in Australian institutions last year, she saw an education in this country as, beyond the adventure of a new land to live in, a stepping stone to a brighter future.\nBut the chaos and caprice of the Covid-19 pandemic has shattered those dreams: it has left her without an education to aspire to or employment to sustain her, and stranded in a foreign country without hope.\n\u201cI lost my job, the school doesn\u2019t want to support us or to discount or freeze our fees and the other bills are still coming in,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cAnd there is not even any moral support from the government because they think \u2026 \u2018we can\u2019t support you\u2019. We understand that their priority is Australian citizens but we feel we are alone in this fight.\u201d\nWith her income cut off and her limited savings steadily eroding, Alexis says she cannot afford to buy food or other essentials, or to pay the bills still steadily mounting. She cannot afford a flight home and even if she could, there are no flights to the Philippines she can take.\nAlexis has a roof over her head, for now, but says without the Filipino diaspora\u2019s bayanihan \u2013 a Tagalog word that roughly translates as a spirit of communal solidarity \u2013 assisting her in Australia, she would be left destitute.\n\u201cI want to thank my Titos and Titas in each organisation in helping us with food and shelter. They gave us light in this darkness and hope and faith that this will eventually pass \u2026 we stay strong together.\u201d\nHer financial precarity keeps her awake at night, but Alexis says it is the repeated and public incidents of racism linked to Covid-19 that have shaken her faith in the country that once welcomed her.\n\u201cI feel so inhuman in the way some Australians treat an Asian international student like me.\n\u201cWhen I was on the train and I was wearing a mask for precaution, a man shouted at me telling me I\u2019m an idiot and stupid and because I\u2019m Asian I brought the virus into this country. He said he wanted to hit me. I felt so hopeless, I just bowed my head and got off the train.\u201d\nIn constructing the massive $130bn stimulus package to save the nation\u2019s economy and as many jobs as possible, the government makes the argument that \u201cwe had to draw the line somewhere\u201d, and that that meant excluding people in Australia on temporary visas.\n\u201cThis is a massive call on the public purse and it is a debt that the country will pay for years to come, and at six million people on the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s nearly half the Australian workforce,\u201d the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, argued.\n\u201cAdd an extra million onto the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s an extra $18bn. We had to draw the line somewhere and I think the Australian people understand how generous, how significant this package is.\u201d\nActing immigration minister Alan Tudge announced this month that international students would be able to access superannuation they had earned, as well as allowing them to work an additional 20 hours a week, if they still had employment.\nBut the government\u2019s chief message during this pandemic to those who are not citizens of Australia has been, simply, to \u201cgo home\u201d.\n\u201cIf you are a visitor in this country, it is time \u2026 to make your way home,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said. \u201cOur focus and our priority is on supporting Australians and Australian residents with the economic supports that are available.\u201d\nFor many, going home is not feasible \u2013 they have built lives and families and communities here. And for others it is simply not possible. There is no way home.\nSome countries have shut their borders to all entrants \u2013 citizens included \u2013 or there are no flights that can get them home, or transit countries such as Singapore have shut their borders to travellers.\nThere are hundreds of thousands in Australia right now stranded with no safety net, and no prospect of government intervention.\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, they were, in many cases, among Australia\u2019s most vulnerable people. They worked often in precarious employment in the gig economy, at risk of exploitation, under-payment and dangerous work practices.\nThey find themselves now stranded in a foreign country, without the social capital of citizenship, or its legal protections. They are without the fallback of family, or the assistance of a lifetime of networks and friendships built up.\nIn many cases, they are entirely alone.\nShubham Baid is in the second semester of a master\u2019s degree at the University of New South Wales.\nA councillor on the university\u2019s postgraduate council, he says his phone nows rings constantly \u2013 15 to 20 calls a day \u2013 from international students worried about their courses or capacity to survive and stay in Australia.\nBaid said students were concerned about being forced to pay full-rate student and course fees, when courses were now running online instead of being delivered in person, and worried they could get caught in breach of their visa conditions by travel restrictions.\n\u201cI can totally understand a country would first look after its citizens,\u201d Baid says, \u201cbut I think there needs to be some consideration, some provision for international students. International education brings an enormous amount, $39bn, into the Australian economy. And we are part of this community. We work and study here, we pay taxes, we live in the Australian community, but right now, we feel very disconnected, we feel isolated.\u201d\nSome initiatives, Baid argues, would cost the government little, if anything, such as automatic visa extensions for students whose studies have been interrupted. Baid says he and fellow councillors are preparing a survey of students, gauging their experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cIf the government cannot be sympathetic it becomes difficult to cope, the future becomes blurred for the students, and it is another great stress on top of the stress that everyone is already feeling during this crisis. We don\u2019t know what our futures will be.\n\u201cWe need to know we will be looked after in this country, that sense of security that everyone longs for, especially at a time like this.\u201d\nReyvi Marinas is a member of Migrante Australia, a community and advocacy group for the Filipino diaspora, which has begun providing donated groceries, counselling and legal advice for students left destitute.\nSome students, he says, come to Migrante\u2019s doors distraught, having been harassed by debt collectors for student fees they simply can\u2019t pay.\nMarinas argues international students are a vital part of Australia, not just of its economy but the fabric of its communities as well, and says they feel \u201cabandoned\u201d by the government in the face of this crisis. There is a moral imperative to help those in the community left vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the crisis, he says.\n\u201cAustralia has encouraged these students to come to Australia \u2026 but in times of need, these students\u2019 contribution has been completely ignored and wilfully disregarded by this government. Many of these students have contributed immensely to the social, cultural and economic fabric of Australian society, many are taxpayers like the rest of Australian citizens and permanent residents in this country.\u201d\nHe says many Filipino students face no choice but to find a way to survive in Australia. There are no flights home, and no way of getting across the Philippine archipelago even if they could find a flight.\n\u201cPeople are really suffering, and they feel abandoned, they feel they are alone in this.\u201d",

There are a dozen flats in her block and she lives with her seven-year-old son, who she says has asthma-like symptoms. She is furious about \u201cthe inconsiderate, selfish behaviour\u201d of residents using communal hallways yet still not complying with lockdown rules.\n\u201cMy neighbour never seemed to do any exercise before and now he\u2019s training for the Olympics, out two or three times a day.\u201d\nMelissa suspects another neighbour has had \u201cdifferent lovers round\u201d in the evening and has been venting to her friends on their CoronaHell WhatsApp group. She says she is proud to be following the rules and feels it\u2019s right to shame those who don\u2019t. \u201cWe all have to protect one another,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can only stay safe together if we do the right thing individually.\u201d She does not want to give her full name.\nPolice have been inundated with thousands of daily reports of people allegedly breaching coronavirus rules, prompting the police\u2019s professional standards body to ask the public to curb \u201cdeliberate false reporting\u201d and the spread of \u201cmisinformation\u201d to target nuisance neighbours or to settle long-running feuds. To date, 3,203 fixed penalty notices have been issued by police, ranging from 380 in Lancashire down to five in Warwickshire.\nAs Britain enters week five of lockdown, \u201ccorona-shaming\u201d has divided debate: what compels a person to publicly corona-shame their neighbour? A moral public duty or an opportunity to vent the mounting frustrations of cabin fever?\nFor Paul Goodman, who set up the Facebook group Covidiots UK two weeks ago, the answer is obvious: \u201cWe have to support the NHS. That\u2019s the reason. The quicker we bring this in line and do what we\u2019re supposed to do, the quicker we return to normalcy.\u201d\nAccording to Google Trends, the term Covidiots \u2013 defined by Urban Dictionary as \u201csomeone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety\u201d \u2013 first appeared online on 15 March.\nGoodman lives in a village in Warwickshire with his wife, who used to be a paramedic. He set up the group for \u201ca couple of dozen friends\u201d, many of them who work in healthcare, \u201cto highlight some of the unbelievable behaviour of people\u201d. There are now almost 200 members. \u201cWe had seen so many people here who feel the rules don\u2019t apply to them. They were blatantly setting up barbecues in local parks, having house parties, sunbathing and so on a few weeks ago. More people seem to be complying now.\u201d\nOn Twitter, a photo of a sign pasted on a window by a neighbour to shame \u201cAnn\u201d who \u201ckeeps on having a friend round\u201d sparked a row over snitching and sanctimony. Later in the week, a videoclip of crowds on Westminster Bridge breaking social distancing guidelines \u2013 ironically, while clapping for the NHS \u2013 horrified social media users and went viral.\nIs this a bit mean? pic.twitter.com/4pEwAc6CEO\nIn Norfolk, an NHS nurse went on Facebook to post a photo of a note left on her car. In a spectacular misfire, the note from a neighbour read: \u201cI have been watching you travel everyday \u2026 this is clearly unessential travel! You are part of the problem! \u2026 You have been reported!\u201d\nOver Easter weekend, author and Times columnist Caitlin Moran was publicly shamed and branded a hypocrite on Twitter for allegedly spending Friday afternoon in a friend\u2019s garden while writing a piece for the Saturday paper headlined \u201cLockdown is easy!\u201d. Neither the Times nor Moran commented on the matter. The incident was preceded by cabinet minister Robert Jenrick, who made media appearances urging the public to stay home, while flouting rules to visit his own parents.\nJon Ronson, author and consultant on an upcoming HBO documentary about shame, with Monica Lewinsky, said he was unsurprised about how quickly \u201ca Stasi-like\u201d narrative had emerged.\n\u201cI can maybe, maybe understand the impulse to shop your neighbour \u2013 I\u2019ve been quarantining for weeks longer than most and can get annoyed at people flouting the rules when I\u2019m working so hard to stick to them. But it\u2019s difficult, because you will always find transgressions slap bang in the middle of a grey area,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what are the rules? I quite like the approach of shaming the behaviour, not the individual.\u201d\nRonson\u2019s 2015 book, So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, explored the twisted downsides to lecture, cancel, and bully people online. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen time and time again when shaming becomes too rampant, terrible things happen. Not least to huge amounts of innocent people.\u201d\nOver on the website Mumsnet, one user was considering vilifying her husband in the village Facebook group for \u201cgoing out at least once a day in his twatty sportscar\u201d while another thread on the internet forum was dedicated to analysing \u201cwhy people are covidiots\u201d.\nFrustration is evidently running high. \u201cThe entitled think they are somehow special and justify their actions to themselves,\u201d wrote lubeybooby. Another poster, Oldhaggard, blamed \u201cgood ol\u2019 fashioned selfishness \u2026 We\u2019re used to our wants being addressed as needs most of the time, and I think people are struggling to see a difference between them.\u201d\nHowever, Stephen Reicher, a professor of psychology at St Andrews and leading expert on crowd psychology, was encouraged by the public response overall. \u201cLevels of compliance are remarkably high. Most people phoning [the police] think they are doing a moral duty. They\u2019re not necessarily evil snitches, they think they\u2019re doing a public good.\n\u201cWe should set positive norms about behaviour. Rather than starting from a presumption of an ill-will, one should start from the presumption that people are good: trust your neighbour and ask how you can help them.\u201d",

It has overtaken neighbouring Iran for the first time to register the highest total in the Middle East.\nAn increase of 3,783 cases in the last 24 hours also pushed Turkey\u2019s confirmed tally within a few hundred of China, where coronavirus first emerged.\n Koca said 121 more people have died, taking the death toll to 1,890.\nMorocco will extend lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus for another month until 20 May, the government said.\nThe decision was made by the government council as the number of confirmed cases rose to 2,685, including 137 deaths and 314 recoveries.\nLockdown conditions imposed on 20 March mean people are only allowed to go out to buy food or medicine and to staff some key jobs. Morocco has made wearing masks mandatory with those who fail to do so risking jail terms and fines.\nFrance registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 19,323, the fourth-highest tally in the world, although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running.\nFrance\u2019s public health authority said the total number of people in intensive care units also fell for the 10th day in a row, to 5,833 \u2013 the lowest level since 31 March.",

A coal miner for nearly 30 years, 54-year-old Robinson and many of his fellow workers already faced years of health issues. And then came Covid-19.\nScarring of the lungs caused by years of coal dust inhalation, more formally known as coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, leaves miners at high risk of developing serious complications from coronavirus. Now the mining industry is trying to cut its payments to the fund that supports those affected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to get sick because of lung damage. We get colds easier. We pick up germs easier. It\u2019s something we deal with all of the time. But the Covid-19 has it doubled up on us,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s made it that much worse.\u201d\nRobinson currently has an upper respiratory infection, which he develops a few times a year due to black lung. The last few years he spent in the mines before retiring, he regularly ate cough drops to try to alleviate his breathing issues. He tries to stay active, but finds himself increasingly short of breath and struggling to get air as his black lung progresses.\nIt took several years for Robinson\u2019s federal black lung benefits claim to be accepted, and he\u2019s still going through court processes that will decide if he continues receiving his benefits for life, despite being diagnosed with the disease.\nWhile miners with black lung struggle during the pandemic, the coal industry is seeking to use the crisis to its advantage, cutting payouts to the federal black lung funds. Last month the National Mining Association asked Congress to decrease the excise tax that coal companies pay toward the fund by 55%. The federal black lung program, which pays out benefits to former coal miners diagnosed with the condition , has already faced financial problems in recent years in part due to coal companies filing for bankruptcy and shifting millions of dollars in liabilities onto taxpayers.\nSome 25,000 former coal miners in the US currently rely on black lung benefits, and Robinson said hundreds of former miners will die trying to obtain their benefits, leaving their widows with nothing.\n\u201cWe have a lot of sick coal miners in the world who need a lot of help,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI wish these coal companies would own up to what\u2019s happened over the years, but they don\u2019t want to spend the money. They\u2019ll pat you on the back, give you \u2018attaboys\u2019 as long as you\u2019re working seven days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day, but once you get sick, then you\u2019re nobody. You made them millions but they don\u2019t want to do anything for you.\u201d\nCoal miners are also experiencing concerns over contracting Covid-19 while struggling with layoffs as some mines shut down because of the pandemic.\nCy Robinette, a heavy equipment mechanic at a coal mine in Florence, Kentucky, for 30 years, was recently laid off due to the pandemic and hasn\u2019t been able to file a claim for unemployment benefits yet because of the state website\u2019s technical difficulties.\n\u201cEverybody is quarantined, there is no work to buy our food and to pay our bills. We\u2019re panicking over where our next meal is going to come from, how long this is going to last,\u201d said Robinette. \u201cIf we get this virus, we will die due to having black lung issues. We won\u2019t last but days or hours, but if it takes working and taking a chance catching the virus so it shall be. It has me at the end of my rope. I don\u2019t know what else I can do just to support my family. I feel like a failure that I can\u2019t work now.\u201d\nAt least one in 10 US coal miners who worked in mines for 25 years or more are diagnosed with black lung. In Appalachia, those rates climb to as many as one out of every five. Appalachia experienced a surge in black lung cases in recent years, as US cases hit a 25-year high in 2018.\nDave Bounds of Oak Hill, West Virginia, worked in the mines for 34 years. The 72-year-old was diagnosed with black lung in 1984. The coronavirus pandemic is another added worry to the everyday issues he faces from the illness.\n\u201cIt scares the living daylights out of me. I don\u2019t want it. I\u2019ve already got infected lungs, I don\u2019t want anything on top of it,\u201d said Bounds.\nHe worked 48 to 54 hours a week underground in conditions, Bounds said, where the coal smog was sometimes so thick he couldn\u2019t see his hand in front of his face, even with his headlamp on.\n\u201cThere were a lot of times in the winter months that I wouldn\u2019t see daylight. I would go in before daylight and come in after dark,\u201d said Bounds. \u201cWhen I was diagnosed in 1984 with black lung, it was just a mild case and you always think you can fight this thing and make it better, but instead it gets worse.\u201d\nBlack lung clinics across Appalachia have shut down due to coronavirus, with doctors insisting patients stay at home and conduct check-ups by phone or internet. New claims for federal black lung benefits and state exams have been put on hold.\n\u201cThis extra impairment would be enough to kill them which is why we\u2019re trying to be so careful in not having them in the clinic and encouraging them to stay at home, stay away from people so they don\u2019t get it because it would be much more difficult for someone like that to recuperate, if it\u2019s even possible,\u201d said Debbi Wills, a black lung clinic coordinator in West Virginia.\nDanny Fouts, a retired coal miner in Beaver, Kentucky who worked in the mines for 23 years and now suffers from black lung disease, has shifted his regular medical check-ups to phone or Skype.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid of anything in my life. This is one time I\u2019m really worried about something,\u201d said Fouts. \u201cIf it\u2019s not my immediate family, I don\u2019t want them knocking on my door, I don\u2019t care who it is. I\u2019ve been telling my nieces and nephews to be careful about going outside. They say \u2018I have a good immune system\u2019, but I tell them \u2018I don\u2019t. Worry about me\u2019.\u201d",

        "content": "With Parisians allowed to go out for only an hour a day, one Belleville resident uses the time to learn the history of her suddenly peaceful neighbourhood\nSince the beginning of France\u2019s total lockdown on 17 March, the weather has been unusually and brilliantly sunny in Paris. But well into our fifth week of confinement, we are only allowed to go out with a dated permission slip and to travel within a 1km radius of our home, once a day, and for a maximum of one hour. Most Parisians have logged their address and arrondissement (district) number into a handy site that calculates the circumference around their home.\nIn my case, this includes the northern reaches of the Belleville neighbourhood, whose inhabitants are historically known for their penchant for rebellion and fights for social justice. It\u2019s also a cultural melting pot and remains boisterously mixed, ethnically and socially, despite the gentrification that has been inching forward for the past 15 years.\nWith no traffic, open businesses or throngs of people, our confinement is an opportunity to explore in depth the familiar streets, and look at landmarks with fresh eyes.\nSetting off at 9.30am, I walk north-east along the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. Cutting through the centre of the circuit to get to its outer edge, I pass a woman I\u2019ve seen several times, who dresses in black and feeds the crows. I\u2019m heading to rue de Mouza\u00efa, which is named after a mountain pass in Algeria that was the site of a battle between French and Algerian troops in 1840. The 19th-century Mouza\u00efa neighbourhood is known for its warren of lanes and houses originally built for quarry workers. The entire neighbourhood is built on gypsum quarries, which produced high-quality plaster for export to North America \u2013 hence its nickname of le quartier de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique. My favourite house is a lemon-yellow one on the corner of a lane called Villa Sadi Carnot: it has a palm tree in the garden and buds on the wisteria are about to unfurl.\nI turn right and walk to the empty Place du Rhin et Danube, where in the late 19th century a horse and fodder market was held. In the middle of the square, purple, red and yellow pansies and poppies are growing around the statue of a woman carrying a sickle and a bushel of wheat. From there I wander north-west down steep rue de Crim\u00e9e to a gate that leads to a small house painted cardinal red, with an icon of a saint up top. This is the entrance to the wooded site of the St Serge Institute of Orthodox Theology, founded by \u00e9migr\u00e9s who came to Paris before the Russian revolution. Next, it\u2019s on to rue de Meaux, where I watch Orthodox Jewish women, and North African women laden with grocery bags as they pass by a social housing complex built in the late 1980s by Italian architect Renzo Piano. Sheets hanging from the windows are painted with messages such as \u201cHooray for public hospitals\u201d and \u201cThank you from the bottom of our hearts\u201d.\nThe rue de Meaux curves west to Place du Colonel Fabien, site of Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s undulating glass Communist Party headquarters, built in 1971.\nSigns of gentrification are visible south of the square, with the Gumbo Yaya Soul Food soul food joint, and a little farther down, where rue de la Grange-aux-Belles meets rue Juliette-Dodu, there\u2019s the Fontaine de Belleville caf\u00e9, normally full of hipster coffee drinkers. All are shuttered. Rue Juliette-Dodu runs along the back of the H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, built in 1607 to quarantine plague victims. In a courtyard inside thecomplex is one of the least-known and most beautiful gardens in Paris, but for now it is closed.\nI turn on to rue Saint-Maur heading south \u2013 here the creeping gentrification of the quartier is more obvious. Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, which crosses rue Saint-Maur a few metres further on acts like a border: near the hospital there are still Turkish kebab shops, small greengrocers still open and a farm shop grocer called Le Court Circuit. I turn left up rue de la Fontaine-au-Roi, given its name in the 17th century because of the pipes that took water from Belleville to the royal palace 10km to the west.\nPast a cluster of lush cherry trees in full bloom, I turn right on to the wide Boulevard de Belleville. The broad pedestrian area in its middle is lined with halal butcher stalls and ethnic grocers that are still open for business. Rue de M\u00e9nilmontant to the north-east is an uphill climb. The area was important during the Paris Commune, a socialist, progressive, revolutionary government thatran Paris for two months in 1871. Near the top of the hill, off a side street on the right is the Bellevilloise, founded in 1877 as Paris\u2019 first cooperative offering political and cultural education to the underprivileged.\nTurning left I come to Place des F\u00eates, where public festivals and open-air dances were held in the 19th century, but which was demolished in 1975 to make way for mammoth social housing projects. Here, I discover an art deco metro station and what is basically a fortified late 16th-century manhole called the Regard de la Lanterne. Next it\u2019s downhill again, going west, to make one last detour to a little-known hillock called the Buttes Bergeyre, reached by steep steps built under apartment buildings or a hidden road. Houses built in the 19th and early 20th centuries line small cobbled streets. From one side of the hill, where there\u2019s a miniature vineyard, I enjoy an extraordinary view of the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur in Montmartre.\nI can\u2019t help but feel lucky that my confinement area \u2013 though the same as for every French resident \u2013 is a particularly rich one.",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Michael McGowan bringing you the main stories on Sunday 19 April.\nThe national death toll has risen to 71, after a 94-year-old New South Wales man who was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, died. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight.\nThe foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has called for an independent international investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne, who was interviewed on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning, was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus.\nThe federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in personal protective equipment equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Hunt also took a swipe at the World Health Organisation, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.\nBeaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would reopen for exercise only. That means jogging on the sand, walking, swimming, surfing and other exercise activities will now be permitted. But ocean pools in Randwick council area will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. Beaches in the neighbouring Waverley council area \u2013 Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte \u2013 remain closed for now. On Saturday Waverley mayor Paula Masselos said the area remained \u201ca hotspot for coronavirus cases and we have no intention of reopening our beaches at this time\u201d.\nThe New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nBrad Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?\nAm I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

The group includes Julian Peto, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, David Hunter, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, and Nisreen A Alwan, an associate professor in public health at Southampton University.\n\u201cQuarantine would end when all residents of the household test negative at the same time. Everyone else in the city can resume normal life, if they choose to,\u201d said the group in a letter to the Lancet journal. \u201cA decision to proceed with national roll-out can then be made. If the epidemic is controlled, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved, intensive care units will no longer be overloaded, and the effects of lockdown on mental ill-health and unemployment will end.\u201d\nIt comes amid continuing doubts about how the government came to its testing target of 100,000 a day by the end of the month. Medical experts and scientists have suggested that it is both too big for the current demand from key workers who think they are infected, and too low to be useful for a mass \u201ctest and trace\u201d strategy to loosen the lockdown.\nAllan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) which represents NHS lab staff and biomedical scientists, said there \u201cwas no evidence base\u201d to the figure. He said: \u201cNo one, as far as I can see, has built it up from the bottom, depending on predicted demand. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do, but even looking at various scenarios would help.\u201d",

        "content": "Bank governors join Ed Miliband in urging Rishi Sunak to cut out the banks and ramp up the Covid-19 lifeboat scheme\nPressure was mounting this weekend on chancellor Rishi Sunak to offer 100% government-backed loans as part of the Covid-19 business lifeboat scheme to prevent thousands of small and medium-sized firms from going bust.\nBusiness groups said commercial lenders, which must currently cover 20% of loan losses under the Cbils government scheme, were turning down requests to borrow rescue funds that could allow firms to remain solvent through the coronavirus lockdown.\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was a matter of urgency that the Treasury simplify the system to allow more businesses to access the one-year, interest-free loans.\nCarolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said on Friday that ministers needed to offer 100% government-backed loans to prevent thousands of businesses going to the wall.\nIt would be \u201can important part of the mix\u201d of loans and grants on offer to rescue firms, she said.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested that a government guarantee for loans under \u00a325,000 might be the only way to circumvent standard bank credit checks.\n\u201cIs there a case [for 100% guarantees] for very small firms that account for quite a high volume of applications? Would it unblock things to change the risk appetite for those firms?\u201d he asked.\nThe latest figures from the finance industry show banks have received around 28,000 loan applications under the month-old scheme, and agreed to make 6,000 loans. It is not known if the remaining 22,000 applicants have been rejected or are still waiting to find out how their application has fared.\nLast week shadow business secretary Ed Miliband urged the business secretary Alok Sharma to overhaul the Cbils loans scheme, or risk thousands of firms going under.\nMiliband recommended that Sharma and Sunak examine the Swiss model, which is based on a single government form that is used by all lenders, and is backed by a 100% government guarantee.\nAt the time, business leaders were reticent to back Miliband\u2019s call, but over the last week the low level of applications and loan agreements has spurred them on to demand a rethink.\nThey have also been joined by former chancellors George Osborne, Norman Lamont and Sajid Javid, who have called on Sunak to \u201ccut out the banks\u201d and move to 100% government-backed business loans.\nTreasury officials are understood to be reluctant to underwrite all loans to small businesses, fearing the system could be abused. They are, however, discussing with business groups how to improve the loans system following criticism that banks have applied strict lending criteria, preventing firms from accessing loans.\nIn particular, banks must ask whether borrowers can afford to repay the loans, which can be made over a six-year period.\nMiliband said it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for many companies to answer the question when the current crisis meant there was so much uncertainty.\n\u201cThe case for 100% underwriting by the government is now unanswerable. Support for it is cross-party and echoed by business groups and the Bank of England.\n\u201cThe fate of many businesses lie in the decisions the chancellor makes over the coming days. He needs to act now, or businesses will begin to go to the wall in increasing numbers.\nLast week, the Treasury extended the CBILS scheme to all viable businesses with turnover of \u00a345m-\u00a3250m, which can apply for government-backed loans of up to \u00a325m. Firms with a turnover of more than \u00a3250m will be allowed to borrow up to \u00a350m from lenders.",

The party, individuals and some media commentators are all said to be the subject of legal complaints as a result of the document\u2019s release and remarks made about its contents.\nThe row caused by the 860-page document has been a huge blow to Keir Starmer\u2019s hopes of uniting Labour under his leadership following years of infighting. It claimed that factional hostility towards Jeremy Corbyn contributed to the party\u2019s ineffective handling of antisemitism complaints and undermined its 2017 election campaign. It also included criticisms of the party and some of its leading figures by staff members in private messages.\nSince it emerged last weekend, some of those mentioned in the document have contacted lawyers, with each person said to be considering several different claims. It exposes Labour to a potentially huge bill should it lose in court or opt to settle.\nJohn McDonnell, Labour\u2019s former shadow chancellor, has said the report was commissioned by general secretary Jennie Formby and put together by the party\u2019s governance and legal unit. It was due to be submitted to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism in the party, but that move was blocked by Labour\u2019s lawyers.\nMark Lewis, a lawyer who has been contacted by those seeking legal action, told the Observer: \u201cThere are lots and lots of claims. There are claims under the Data Protection Act, there are claims for breach of confidence or invasion of privacy and there are claims for libel. It is a very lengthy report that mentions a lot of people. I\u2019ve been contacted by 15 people. Each one of them could well have several claims. What is going on is phenomenal. It\u2019s a bit like the soldiers leaving a barracks that they have to desert and setting it on fire.\n\u201cFor four years, people in Labour have said there is no antisemitism in the party, it\u2019s just a smear. Now they say that of course there was antisemitism, \u2018but it just wasn\u2019t us\u2019. They have not noticed the absurdity of their change of position. There are actions against the party, actions against individuals, actions against commentators. People need to be careful about statements that have been made. If this bankrupts the Labour party or individuals, so be it. Actions have consequences.\u201d\nOne of those considering legal action, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cSeveral of us are already in detailed conversations with a number of legal teams. The Labour party had made serious allegations about our behaviour. These allegations were never put to us and not a single one of us did anything other than to work towards the best possible result in the 2017 election. Many of us are now being subjected to horrendous online abuse directly as a consequence.\u201d\nFormby has told party staff that the inquiry into the report, ordered by Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner, will examine how it was commissioned, the culture it reveals and who leaked it. Local party branches have been ordered not to share it.",

        "content": "BP denied the oil reached Mexico, but fisherman and scientists knew it wasn\u2019t true. Ten years on, Mexican communities haven\u2019t received a cent in compensation\nErica R\u00edos Mart\u00ednez grew-up in a riverside community filled with food and fiestas thanks to a booming fishing industry which supported tens of thousands of families across the Gulf of Mexico.\nAfter high school, R\u00edos Mart\u00ednez moved to a nearby town for college which she financed by selling blue crabs, shrimp and tilapia fished by her father in the Tamiahua lagoon \u2013 an elongated coastal inlet famed for its abundant shellfish.\nBut fish stocks began to decline in 2011 across the Gulf \u2013 the year after BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded 200 miles north of Mexican territory. The offshore rig sank and released almost 5m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days. Oil plumes coated hundreds of miles of shoreline, causing catastrophic damage to marine life, coral reefs and birds.\nAmid public and political outrage in the US, BP took full responsibility for the worst oil spill of the 20th century, which killed 11 crew members and injured 17 others. The company has paid out $69bn, including more than $10bn to affected fishermen and businesses.\nBut BP denied the oil reached Mexico, claiming the ocean current propelled the huge spill in the opposite direction. However, fishermen and Mexican scientists knew this wasn\u2019t true.\n\u201cBefore the spill we had freezers full of fish. Afterwards, my father couldn\u2019t catch enough to support me, no matter how many hours he spent fishing. It was the same for the whole community, and it has just got worse and worse,\u201d said R\u00edos Mart\u00ednez, 31, who was forced to drop out of university and move away.\nTen years later, Mexican communities have not received a single cent in compensation.\n\u201cTo claim the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem has borders is absurd, discriminatory and defies scientific knowledge,\u201d said Eduardo Rubio, an expert in soil and water pollution at the College of Biologists.\nSaladero is a picturesque sleepy village situated on the bank of the Tancochin River which snakes into the south-westerly edge of the lagoon.\nBefore the BP disaster, 95% of the village made a living \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 from fishing in the lagoon which stretches 65 miles from Tampico, Tamaulipas to Tuxpan, Veracruz.\nThe lagoon was famous for prawns and oysters fishermen recall giving away because stocks were so abundant.\nNow, youngsters are forced to migrate to find factory work in maquilas in faraway cities.\n\u201cThe village is full of us old people, there\u2019s nothing for the young here any more,\u201d said Juan Mar Aran, 78, a fisherman for 60 years. \u201cBefore, we worked hard and had money in our pockets, now we depend on our children, even the dogs are skinny. It\u2019s very unjust, we\u2019ve been completely abandoned.\u201d\nIn 2010, the Saladero fishing cooperative registered 11,663kg of shrimp, 36kg of bass and 281,125kg of oysters. The decline has not been linear and publicly available official data is inconclusive, but in 2019, the co-op registered only 1,000kg of shrimp, 20kg of bass, and no oysters.\n\u201cThe American fishermen supported by President Obama were properly compensated whereas we\u2019ve been mocked, humiliated and discriminated against by British [Petroleum] \u2026 and let down by our own government. Ten years of struggle and nothing,\u201d said Enrique Aran, 62, president of the cooperative.\nIn Tamiahua, a small town across the lagoon, Eduviges Mendoza lit a cigarette on his small fishing boat, parked beside a row of wooden poles waiting for shrimp to fill his small net.\nIt\u2019s dusk, and chilly as Mendoza, 53, settled in for a second consecutive night on the lagoon with only a ratty blanket and a waterproof onesie for warmth. \u201cThere\u2019s less fish, nobody can deny that. I\u2019m lucky if I make enough to cover the petrol.\u201d\nDespite such sentiments BP has claimed that aerial images prove the oil spill\u2019s impact was contained in US waters.\nYet back in 2011, Sergio Jim\u00e9nez, a leading government oceanographer in Tamaulipas state, discovered the BP oil fingerprint more than 200 metres below sea level. Hydrocarbon fingerprints, like human ones, are unique.\nThe oil from Deepwater Horizon was propelled south by the deep underwater current \u2013 distinct from the surface current, according to Jim\u00e9nez, who in 2013 testified in a Louisiana court tasked with managing hundreds of claims against BP.\nBut the case was dismissed after the court ruled that Mexico\u2019s lawsuit, filed by the then president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, just days before the deadline, superseded individual state claims.\nThe case trundled along until in 2018, the Mexican government withdrew the lawsuit and settled the case for $25.5m \u2013 absolving BP from responsibility for polluting Mexican waters. The secret deal, exposed in a joint investigation by BuzzFeed and the transparency group Poder, means the company no longer faces claims by any Mexican government entity.\nAround the same time, the outgoing President Pe\u00f1a Nieto made several multimillion-dollar deals with BP. Hundreds of the company\u2019s petrol stations have opened across the country.\nJim\u00e9nez stands by his findings and a recent study by the University of Miami backed his research, concluding that the spread of oil was far greater and more catastrophic than previously thought, as satellites and aerial images failed to detect oil at lower concentrations below the surface.\nThis \u201cinvisible oil\u201d was substantial enough and toxic enough to destroy 50% of the marine life it encountered, according to Science.\nIn part, this is probably due to the unprecedented quantities of toxic chemicals (dispersants) BP applied in order to stop visible oil plumes making landfall.\nAs a result, up to 40% of the leaked oil could still remain on the seabed. These \u201cinvisible oil\u201d blocks will eventually break down and spread gradually over years \u2013 possibly decades \u2013 to come.\n\u201cIt could take at least 20 to 25 years for the ecosystem to recover because of the deepwater contamination,\u201d said the investigative oceanographer Luis Soto.\nBut scientific study, like compensation, has been massively skewed.\nIn Mexico no long-term studies monitoring the impact of the spill and the dispersants have been conducted.\nBy contrast in the US, a research working group created by BP conducted more than 240 studies, which cost $1.3bn in less than five years after the spill. BP also set up a $500m, 10-year program to monitor US waters just over a month after the spill and aid to restore the ecosystem.\nBP has not directly funded any studies or working groups in Mexico, but the battle for justice goes on.\nIn Mexico, a class-action lawsuit was launched against four BP subsidiaries \u2013 two headquartered in Texas, two in Mexico \u2013 in December 2015, by an NGO working with pro bono lawyers specialising in environmental disasters.\nIt took two years and several court orders to track down the correct addresses of the Mexican subsidiaries in order to kickstart proceedings. Finally, in September 2019, the lawsuit was authorised to proceed despite BP\u2019s efforts to have it dismissed, but is currently on hold since BP appealed.\n\u201cBP\u2019s pattern has been to deny everything, and claim the class action no merit, meanwhile settling many cases worth billions of dollars in the US. The position of BP is sad, but so is the position of the Mexican government which has ignored the plight of its own people,\u201d said lawyer Karla Borja.\nIn 2019, Mexico\u2019s new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (Amlo), promised the fishermen a fair deal. \u201cAmlo promised to make the company pay. But so far we\u2019ve seen nothing but nice words and meetings,\u201d said Aran, the co-op president.\nIn Louisiana, more than 110 cases involving thousands of Mexicans remain open, but have yet to be heard. Scores more have been dismissed.\nIn March, the fishermen leading 41 of those cases wrote to the new CEO of BP, Bernard Looney, requesting he do the right thing and compensate the Mexicans affected by the oil spill.\nIn a statement BP said: \u201cAll available evidence confirms that oil from the Deepwater Horizon incident did not reach Mexican waters or shorelines \u2026 We value the opportunity to do business in Mexico, and we are committed to the highest standards of conduct and full compliance with the laws.\u201d\nIn Saladero, shortly before the 10th anniversary of the disaster, about 150 people turned out for the town hall-style meeting, to share stories of hardship resulting from the demise of the lagoon which has divided families and crushed educational and career ambitions.\nThe primary school has fewer than 30 enrolled pupils, compared with more than a hundred before the spill. The only gas station shut down and abandoned boats dot the riverbank.\nNumerous parents said they were forced to pull their children out of college so they could start work and send home remittances to support the family.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no money because there\u2019s no fish, that\u2019s why all our young people leave,\u201d said Juana Constantino, 59, who cares for her grandson while her daughter works in a maquila in Reynosa, one of Mexico\u2019s most dangerous border towns. \u201cWe need compensation, we want justice.\u201d",

        "content": "Coronavirus could be Trump\u2019s downfall \u2013 but another bullying leader reminiscent of Trump won election after election\nDonald Trump\u2019s handling of coronavirus appears to be not so much a car wreck as a multiple pile-up, one vehicle slamming into another in a mound of twisted metal.\nFirst denial and complacency that left hospitals and laboratories unprepared, then shouting matches with governors and the media, then peddling a dodgy remedy and conspiracy theories, and now scapegoating the World Health Organization. With November\u2019s election approaching, Covid-19 may end up engraved on Trump\u2019s political tombstone.\nOr not. I\u2019ve seen a version of this movie before and at the end the president wins. His name was Hugo Chavez.\nVenezuela\u2019s mercurial leader died in 2013 but set a template that Trump has successfully followed since running for the Republican nomination in 2016.\nBluster, distraction, polarisation and patronage go a long way when fused with shrewd electoral calculation. It put Trump in the White House and could give him another term. Little matter if the path is strewn with policy fiascos.\nDuring his 14-year rule, Chavez presided over economic dysfunction, managerial chaos and creeping authoritarianism. He died before Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse but left the country hollowed and riven by violent crime so frightening people stayed indoors at night, a de facto lockdown.\nHe also picked fights with state governors, the media and multinational organisations, propagated conspiracy theories \u2013 Nasa faked the moon landings, the CIA infected leftwing leaders with cancer \u2013 and proclaimed a \u201cmiracle\u201d cure for his own terminal illness. He won election after election.\nIt helped that he was able to bully opponents, abuse electoral rules, exploit state patronage and harness sycophantic TV channels, with Mario Silva, presenter of a show called the Razorblade, acting as his Sean Hannity.\nComparisons with the US have limits. There are obvious differences between a rich superpower with strong institutions and separation of powers and Venezuela, a rickety petro-state long subject to caudillos. And this is a unique time: coronavirus has turned the world upside down.\nAmid such flux Joe Biden may well win in November. But Trump is sticking with a playbook that has served him well.\nIn a June 2016 article I noted that in the extemporized mix of bombast, menace and bawdy humor, the symbiotic relationship with crowds, the articulation of long-repressed grievances, Trump channeled Venezuela\u2019s late comandante.\nThey were ideological opposites \u2013 Chavez was a socialist, prioritised the poor, and revered Fidel Castro \u2013 but as media-savvy populists they worked the same pitch: the avenging outsider out to overturn a rotten system and make their nation great again. Each calculated, correctly, that electoral arithmetic made polarisation a winning strategy.\nThey deployed humor, insults and vulgarity to rupture protocol and connect with supporters on a gut level. Ch\u00e1vez branded opponents \u201cassholes\u201d, Trump called them \u201cpussies\u201d. Ch\u00e1vez leered at a camera to tell his then wife, \u201cMarisabel, you\u2019re going to get yours tonight\u201d. Trump bragged about penis size.\nThere was genius to it. Suck up the oxygen and leave rivals gasping for air. Thunder and dazzle, shock and provoke. Dominate.\nFour years later Trump is the incumbent with a record to defend, but like Ch\u00e1vez he still plays the insurgent, the people\u2019s champion who is beset by nefarious forces (deep state, oligarchs, saboteurs, leakers) and must hit back to defend himself and, by extension, the popular will.\n\u201cWhen somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,\u201d Trump said last week. Ch\u00e1vez was equally blunt: \u201cI am not an individual, I am the people. It\u2019s my duty to demand respect for the people.\u201d\nI wondered in 2016 if Trump would be as deft as Ch\u00e1vez in consolidating power and turning crises to his advantage. Mostly, he has.\nHe has appointed close to 200 federal judges, moulded the GOP in his image, subverted government agencies and hijacked investigations. He has admitted that voter suppression benefits Republicans and shrugged off the outcry. He ordered his name be printed on federal cheques to be sent to millions of Americans: chavismo 101.\nTrump lacks Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s discipline. In speeches and press conferences the comandante would zig-zag from economic policy to tirades about opponents, reminiscences about his army days, praise for his daughter, an anecdote about foreign leaders and back to economic policy. He was narcissistic and prolix, speaking up to seven, eight, nine hours straight.\nBut he avoided certain topics, notably crime, a violent pandemic his administration failed to tame. So he kept shtum. Morgues would fill, and he\u2019d say nothing. He refused to own the problem. It worked: the poor, who suffered most from crime, blamed thugs, police, mayors or governors but seldom Ch\u00e1vez.\nTrump in contrast cannot resist taking centre stage in the coronavirus drama. Armageddon \u2013 tremendous ratings. The risk is that his bungling will create a backlash, that policy flip-flops and wild, contradictory statements will, for once, alienate supporters.\nDon\u2019t count on it. The playbook is versatile.\nYou see it during the White House press briefings. Journalists ask questions, Trump riffs, they interrupt, he rants, they interrupt again, voices swell, insults zing, it\u2019s a circus. Holding the president to account is vital and legitimate.\nBut some of the reporting is tinged with glee: he\u2019s an idiot, we always said he was an idiot, here\u2019s the proof. \u201cA manic, gibbering, squint-eyed ragefest by America\u2019s worst president,\u201d Rick Wilson wrote in the Daily Beast.\nBut many people see something else: a leader doing his best being badgered by show-off journalists.\nCh\u00e1vez mastered the art of baiting the media. Even after building a state propaganda apparatus and cowing private outlets \u2013 some of which had backed a 2002 coup against him \u2013 he picked fights with journalists to reinforce the narrative of elites out to get him.\nIncumbency bestows another advantage: critics can come to resemble Cassandras. Just as the president racks up a record, good or bad, his foes rack up predictions, some of which date poorly.\nCh\u00e1vez enjoyed reciting warnings that he was or would become a communist dictator. In fact there was a petro-dollar-fuelled consumer boom for much of his rule.\nElect Trump, it was said in 2016, and he would blow up the economy, democracy, Nato, North Korea and possibly apple pie. Four years later the damage wrought by Trump on ordinary lives, environmental standards and US values is indeed immense.\nBut he did not start wars, lock up Hillary Clinton or make everyone burn coal. The sky did not fall. Until coronavirus the economy hummed and Trump became, if not normalised, at least familiar. Many people who hesitated to vote for him because he was so outlandish, so risky, may feel emboldened to back him this time.\nIn Venezuela they were called ni-nis, voters who were neither for Chavez nor for the opposition, who floated in the middle until election day and then voted with their pocketbook. The comandante, a pragmatist more than a socialist, knew how to get them onside.\nIn battleground states in November it will be the turn of his US apprentice.\nRory Carroll was based in Venezuela as the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent from 2006 to 2012.

        "content": "The rugged Soviet-era car is 50 years old \u2013 and in Havana, classic models still sell for the price of a house\nLandy is a stylish man. He has an ageing crooner\u2019s slicked-back hair, the short-sleeved cool of a Miami Beach architect, and a terrible, terrible Lada car.\nHe\u2019s my go-to chofer in Havana, which sounds a little grand, but it\u2019s more economical than buying one of these babies, which will set you back \u00a315,000. It\u2019s also why, despite the windows having no handles (a wrench is passed back) and the rear seat containing a loose spring like an unkind proctologist, Landy fusses over it like a baby.\nFor this little blue car completes his look. On this island better known for its American incredible hulks, it marks him out as a member of the Ladaocracia, Cuba\u2019s revolutionary Lada aristocracy.\nIt\u2019s 50 years to the day since the first Lada ran off the production line in Tolyatti, a Russian company town \u2013 also known as Togliatti \u2013 on a bend in the Volga. That means it\u2019s also three days until the 150th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, whose centenary that moment celebrated.\nA collaboration between the Soviet state and Italy\u2019s Fiat, the Lada was the vision of designers who set out to make these small cars virtually indestructible. The result was the Zhiguli, a bulked-up Fiat 124, that even poets have struggled to describe as anything other than \u201cboxy\u201d.\nThe body was toughened, drum brakes installed and clearance was heightened, all to help with the Russian roads and winters. More crucially, the car \u2013 renamed for the world as the Lada \u2013 was easy to maintain. The \u201cclassic\u201d Lada became one of history\u2019s most manufactured vehicles, with around 18 million built.\nIn the 1970s, Soviet support for Cuba was at its height. \u201cThe government gave Ladas to doctors, people working on the sugar farms, athletes, engineers, scientists,\u201d says Hendy Cobas, of Cuba\u2019s Club Amigos del Motor, which has 1,000 members.\nThis set the owners apart from those with the leftover Chevy Bel Airs and Ford Fairlanes from before the 1959 revolution. A friend recalls going to nightclubs and seeing the smarter set beginning to jump into Ladas at closing time: \u201cYou knew their parents or grandparents were someone important.\u201d\nWilly Hierro Allen, the 77-year-old editor-in-chief of the magazine Excelencias del Motor, recalls: \u201cIn 1978, I was running Transporte magazine, and it seems someone thought I deserved it. The vice-minister called and told me \u2018you are going to have a car\u2019. I felt really excited. The car was blue. I still keep it the same colour.\u201d\nCuba\u2019s extraordinary ability to soften and sentimentalise swiftly went to work on the utilitarian runaround. \u201cAlmost any Cuban can change the spark plugs, and most can swap the brake pads and fuel pumps,\u201d says Cobas. \u201cLadas are members of the family.\u201d It\u2019s a sentence everyone here uses.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen modifications to the bodywork, new air inlets or extensions to make it closer to the ground, but, apart from music systems, these are always small,\u201d he goes on. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel good about making big cuts on a Lada\u2019s bodywork, it\u2019s like you are cutting somebody.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why people look after them. The last classic Lada arrived in Cuba in 1988, but AutoCubana, Cuba\u2019s version of Autotrader, lists models from 18,000 Cuban convertible pesos (CUC) \u2013 about \u00a314,500. Good ones sell for twice that. It isn\u2019t love, though; it\u2019s the dearth of other cars. For that money, Cubans can buy an apartment in one of the best areas of Havana.\nFollowing perestroika, Lada\u2019s vast parent company, AvtoVAZ, went through the upheavals felt by many Soviet state industries. Production plummeted and corruption flourished.\nWhile the classic Lada continued to be built, the wheels were coming off. In the mid 1990s, there were 130,000 Ladas registered in the UK, By 2018 there were just 179.\nCountries were imposing carbon emission laws and the Lada couldn\u2019t make the grade. Only in Cuba, with its estimated 250,000 Ladas, did the smoke refuse to clear.\n\u201cHere, we are responsible for caring for our cars,\u201d says Hierro, the editor of Excelencias del Motor. \u201cWhen you grow old your son comes saying \u2018Dad, let me fix the car\u2019, then your son has a son too, and with time he is the one in charge of the car. That\u2019s how the Lada ended up becoming the car of the Cuban family.\u201d\nSadly, as Landy and I head out to the highway, it may be the lingering smell of exhaust fumes that triggers my nostalgia. My first car was a Skoda, the Czech equivalent of the Lada. My dad bought it for me, saying \u2013 and I still hope he was joking \u2013 that he\u2019d got it cheap because the previous owner had suffocated in it.\nThere\u2019s only so much I can take. I have a second go-to chofer. Jesus is a more austere figure than Landy. He rents a modern Lada from the state, one of 320 built under AvtoVAZ\u2019s new owner, Renault, that arrived here in 2017. It is an entirely different creature and, in truth, it\u2019s far better for long journeys. As Jesus says: \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable and has a large trunk.\u201d",

        "content": "Charities accuse the government of putting cost above taking action to help isolate up to 35,000 still at risk in shelters\nFor now they have no names and little is known about their backgrounds. But the Observer has established that at least six homeless people linked to hostels in London have died from coronavirus since March, triggering fears that outbreaks in crowded facilities with vulnerable people in poor health sharing bathrooms, dining rooms and even bedrooms could be catastrophic.\nThe six are thought to be the first known homeless victims of the virus in the UK. While most rough-sleepers and people staying in large dormitories in emergency night shelters have been moved into hotels by councils, up to 35,000 people may still be in homeless hostels across the UK.\nThe initial results of a survey by the UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health reveal the coronavirus death rate of homeless people living in London\u2019s hostels is 25 times higher than the general adult population. It found that 38% of hostels in the capital had suspected Covid-19 cases, with 41% of sick residents sharing bathrooms with other residents and 35% of affected hostels still using communal dining rooms. At least 17 residents have been admitted to hospital with more serve symptoms since March.\nModelling by UCL indicates this grave situation could worsen unless the government scales up testing and removes infected residents from shared hostels to special facilities. The model, set to be released next week, predicts up to 12,000 hospital admissions and 900 deaths of homeless people in England over the next three to four months if no action is taken.\nProfessor Andrew Hayward, one of the centre\u2019s directors, claimed the government had failed to publish and implement the plans that he had helped prepare for the Ministry of Housing to test hostel residents with symptoms and move those who could not self-isolate to special facilities in empty hotels.\n\u201cThis leaves the homeless sector with no plan of action and no central government guidance on how to reduce the threat of outbreaks or respond to outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cHostels are doing their best in difficult circumstances by intensifying cleaning and enforcing social distancing but they cannot contain all the risks. There is a real danger we will see explosive outbreaks in hostels, with large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths.\u201d\nHe said the government appeared more concerned with the cost of his plan than the risks to a very vulnerable population. \u201cI\u2019m worried that this decision is driven more by a concern that we can\u2019t afford to ramp up the capacity to accommodate homeless people in special facilities than the risk of infection in hostels,\u201d he said.\nThe UCL centre has helped set up a small 60-bed facility for homeless people in an empty hotel in east London, with funding from the NHS and the Greater London Authority. But Hayward said it needed urgently to be expanded and replicated in other cities.\n\u201cWe have already had 23 admissions and it only opened last week \u2013 it could be full by the end of next week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to move people out of hostels when there is a high transmission risk. If we don\u2019t take this kind of action, we could see many more preventable deaths.\u201d\nThere are few details of the homeless lives claimed by the virus \u2013 and most experts expect the actual death toll to be much higher. One charity said an elderly man, who was staying in a large London hostel, tested positive and died in the hospital after the UK lockdown was imposed on 23 March. Other victims included a well known former hostel resident who contracted coronavirus on the streets.\nHomeless charity St Mungo\u2019s has assessed 70% of 1,200 people in its hostels and supported housing, with about 4% showing coronavirus symptoms. Dominic Williamson, St Mungo\u2019s director of policy and strategy, said he knew of least two suspected deaths from coronavirus.\n\u201cOne was in our services in London. The other was sleeping rough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe action that has been taken by our services has helped minimise the issue so far but it is still early days.\u201d He added that sick residents were being helped to self-isolate within the charity\u2019s 49 hostels across the south of England, with those most at risk moved out to hotels.\nOther charities have experienced clusters of suspected cases. The Single Homeless Project said there had been 19 suspected cases in its 32 London hostels, which accommodate 600 rough sleepers.\nToni Warner, SHP\u2019s director of services, said she was fearful of further outbreaks. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to keep people separate and within their rooms,\u201d she said. About 30% of the charity\u2019s hostel residents needed to be shielded because they had chronic health issues. \u201cSome are going into hotels,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are also allocating space within hostels to isolate vulnerable people but it is not easy.\u201d\nHousing association Look Ahead said there had been at least one suspected coronavirus case in all 10 of the homeless hostels it runs in London and Kent. Megan Reynolds, the association\u2019s deputy director of operations, said larger outbreaks would be devastating. \u201cIf there was a severe outbreak in a hostel, it could be catastrophic,\u201d she said.\nThe association has moved some of its most vulnerable residents but hundreds were still living in shared hostels. \u201cA lot of our hostels were built many years ago. They have narrow corridors. The toilets, showers and communal spaces are used by multiple people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not always easy for rough sleepers with mental health disorders or learning difficulties to follow rules on social distancing.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cOver 90% of people sleeping rough, including those in communal places like night shelters, who were known to local authorities at the start of the crisis have now been made offers of safe accommodation.\u201d\nWhen former rough sleeper Mohammed Jouda started coughing at work, he went back to his shared flat linked to the 154-bed YMCA hostel in north London. \u201cI had trouble breathing and I had a fever,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt really bad.\u201d\nThe next day, Jouda, 38, who has asthma, called 111 and was diagnosed with coronavirus. He did what he could to stay out of the way of the two other men in the flat. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to pass the virus to them but it\u2019s very difficult when you share a kitchen and bathroom. I have to eat and go to the toilet sometimes.\u201d\nHe found it increasingly hard to breathe and called an ambulance. \u201cThey found me lying in the bed and gave me oxygen,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried I might pass away.\u201d\nThe YMCA hostel moved him into a self-contained room in the main hostel when he came back from the nearby Whittington hospital. Jouda, who became homeless when he was evicted and ended up sleeping in a park, was readmitted to hospital 10 days later, where he recovered from the virus. Although he is well now, he is worried he might be reinfected in his shared flat. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that people who have had coronavirus can get it again.\u201d",

Not literally, obviously \u2013 I was stuck at home like everyone else. But I decided to use my ample spare time to seek out some virtual thrills, or at least try to learn some new skills.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nI was inspired by Plas Y Brenin, the National Outdoor Centre in Snowdonia. While the centre is closed, it is posting videos and other content to help people brush up their outdoors skills from inside their homes, so we can all make the most of our liberty when the crisis is over (see instagram.com/plasybreninofficial). I had a go at the knots and ropework demonstrated in a mountaineering video. I certainly wouldn\u2019t trust myself to get anyone safely down a mountain just yet, but it was a start.\nPlas Y Brenin is just one of 35 outdoors organisations, including the National Trust, the Ramblers and Forestry England, that are sharing ideas about how to stay active in and near your home. Many of them are on the Get Outside Inside hub on the Ordnance Survey website. As someone who is lost without Google Maps, I found the beginner\u2019s guide to \u201cproper\u201d map-reading particularly useful.\nAfter the stress of orienteering, albeit just around my garden, I chilled out with a free 45-minute Breathe Calm class hosted by Adventures in Movement, a chi running company. The teacher, Gray Caws, should have been gearing up for his next running retreat in Bali. Instead, he is holding virtual workshops (free and paid) on running technique and efficient breathing, with tips that I am now putting into practice during my daily walk/jog. Now would also be a good time to commit to the free 20-day chi running course, with daily drills.\nWith swimming off the agenda, I settled for a free breath hold workshop with Finisterre, a surfing company (next workshop 25 April, instagram.com/finisterreuk). Hanli Prinsloo, a record-breaking South African freediver and ocean conservationist, talked us through something called \u201cCO2 tables\u201d, a way of improving the body\u2019s tolerance of carbon dioxide through successive breath holds. Practising my tables a few times a week during won\u2019t make me a champion freediver \u2013 but at least I might be able to swim an underwater length of my local lido when it finally reopens.",

During the downtime we can work on making a more just society\nGreetings to all who have come across this message. I wish this interaction was on better terms. A lot has changed within the US over the past few weeks and unfortunately it\u2019s uncertain how much more will be essential to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d or lessen this vile pandemic.\nMisinformation is at a peak, and I can feel the collective restlessness increase as the days pass. You are not alone. It seems like the people responsible for conveying information all have different messages with separate agendas. From our local media to our governing officials all the way up to the man in the suit. In this most dire of times, there have been displays of dissidence, and controversy from our political elites, causing confusion among the public. If that last sentence applies to you, our frustrations are shared. With that being said, it is paramount that everyone remains calm. An outbreak of turmoil and chaos that matches the pandemic would be further detrimental to not just the economy, but to us as a society, and community, as a whole.\nAmerica\u2019s lack of medical resources is barefaced, and the number of unemployment claims is at an all-time high. I understand the urge to protect your closest loved ones,. However, if you have the means, I urge you to extend a hand to a neighbor or friend who may be less fortunate. As I write this more than 30,000 people have lost their lives in the US alone. Of those heart-wrenching numbers, the percentage of African Americans and people of color is both alarming and disproportionate. Our healthcare system could be potentially highlighting injustices this beautiful nation has composed and suppressed since its establishment.\nMy intention in writing this editorial is to hopefully inspire our society to come together rather than drift farther and farther apart. In the midst of social distancing it is easy to segregate ourselves and our families from the outside world. I challenge you to do the opposite. Donate to your local food banks, homeless shelters and to those less fortunate in general. Allocate resources to healthcare workers, and other extraordinary workers and unsung heroes during this time. Lend a hand to the families and family members of healthcare workers and those who have lost someone, and are in need of economic support. The slightest display of compassion may save someone\u2019s life. I am looking to match these efforts and align with people who are inclined to do something.\nAfter being personally affected by this outbreak and its impact on the NBA, there is no way that I can look away after seeing how friends, family and teammates have been affected by this virus. I am proud to be a member of the Boston Celtics and of the NBA for ceasing to continue the season at this time. Sports have an influential position in our society, and I\u2019m grateful the NBA uses its platform considerately.\nMy deepest condolences go out to Karl-Anthony Towns, and his family, for the recent loss of his beautiful mother Jackie from Covid-19; the entire NBA mourns with you. I also extend my condolences to anyone with a similar experience or shared communal pain. As we all suffer from being torn apart, from news of heartbreak and anguish, my greatest hope is that during this isolation we become more unified than ever.\nAs I stare at the walls of my confinement, due to the implementation of social distancing, I hope that our nation not only consolidates over the next few weeks but also heals. Ponder the suffrage from other epidemics that have plagued this nation and our planet. Social inequality, gender inequality, inequality in education, poverty, lack of resources, cultural biases, and other various societal imbalances that have yet to be vaccinated. Let\u2019s use this time to look for solution based answers and cooperative efforts for those problems.\nIt\u2019s Game 7 and how we perform down the stretch is going to determine our outcome. Let\u2019s lean in and get this done together as a team.\nJaylen Brown is a member of the NBA\u2019s Boston Celtics",

        "content": "In the blink of an eye, a 21-year-old Sussex quick went from total obscurity to being one of the most exciting prospects in cricket\nMatches between touring sides and English counties were memorable in their own right not so long ago. Large crowds would flock to see whether their local heroes could take down international stars a peg or two. Counties would field their strongest team for a fixture that \u2013 before the cash cow that is Twenty20 \u2013 would almost certainly be their most lucrative of the year.\nWhen the Pakistanis arrived at Hove in 2016 to prepare for their four-Test series against England that was certainly not the case any more. Unless it was Australia or India in town, interest in such games had waned and as a sporting contest they had largely turned into glorified practice sessions. The drop in prestige explains why Sussex took to the field just eight hours after returning from a game in Cardiff the previous night.\nYet that crazy scheduling opened the door for an unknown by the name of Jofra Chioke Archer to make his first-class debut. In the blink of an eye, the 21-year-old went from total obscurity to being one of the most exciting prospects in the game. To say he hasn\u2019t looked back since is an understatement.\nThe smattering of spectators who braved a chilly morning on the south coast were still settling into the deckchairs at the Cromwell Road end when Archer offered the first indication of his phenomenal natural ability. Only the true diehards who had perhaps caught a glimpse of him playing club or second-team cricket had an inkling of what was to come as he sauntered up the slope from the Sea end to deliver his first ball to Shan Masood.\nArcher did not take a wicket \u2013 he had to wait another 10 deliveries for that milestone \u2013 but the speed he generated with the minimum of effort was truly startling. Those not still queuing for coffee or perusing the newspaper turned to the person next to them to check they had also witnessed it. By the time Archer had completed his first over they were busy googling his name in a bid to discover where Sussex had unearthed such a player.\nIt was genuinely one of those wow moments that are so rare in sport. We may be familiar with Archer generating express pace from such a languid action now, but four years ago it was a bolt from the blue. Every great athlete has to start somewhere but usually their debuts are accompanied by a tidal wave of hype or preceded by record-breaking achievements during glittering junior careers. Archer appeared from nowhere \u2013 if you discount three caps for West Indies Under-19s \u2013 but it was instantly obvious he was destined for the top.\nArcher claimed his maiden wicket in his second over, slanting a ball across Masood and finding the edge. His second victim, Mohammad Hafeez, had no answer to a ball that nipped back and crashed into his pads.\nAfter such an unexpected opening the game returned to script as the Pakistanis piled on the runs and we wondered whether Archer\u2019s opening blitz had been a false dawn. Any doubts were emphatically wiped away when he removed Misbah-ul-Haq and Azhar Ali in quick succession with the new ball.\nThe Pakistanis closed the opening day on 363 for five, making Archer\u2019s figures of four for 49 even more outstanding. His victims were no mugs either, as they had amassed 53 international hundreds between them. The game petered out into an inevitable draw but not before Archer dismissed Hafeez again \u2013 the only wicket to fall in Pakistan\u2019s second innings.\nArcher\u2019s rise since has been phenomenal. He did not even have a professional contract when he lined up against the Pakistanis but in less than four years he has been named as one of Wisden\u2019s five cricketers of the year, having helped England lift the World Cup and starred in the Ashes the previous summer. Those at Hove for his debut only wondered why it took so long.",

The amount may triple in the coming months to fill up to 200 supertankers, according to the shipping experts.\nCommodity traders are hunting for extra space to store their crude as demand for oil collapses by 29m barrels per day in April compared with last year, falling to lows not seen since 1995. The traders are understood to be storing the excess crude in the hope it can be sold at a profit when demand for transport fuels returns later this year.\nThe slump in demand has created an oversupply of 9m barrels a day in the global market which threatens to swamp the world\u2019s traditional oil storage within weeks, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics.\nThe analysts expect a \u201cmassive\u201d increase in oil storage of between 500m to 1bn barrels of oil compared with stock levels at the end of February, which could fill global storage facilities to the brim by May.\nThis could trigger an oil market collapse to an average price of between $10 to $20 a barrel in the second quarter of the year \u2013 from about $65 a barrel at the start of the year \u2013 and force oil producers to shut their wells.\nS&P Global expects an oil market recovery to be \u201clargely delayed\u201d until next year even after the world\u2019s largest oil producers struck the most ambitious supply deal in history to cut up to 20% of world\u2019s output from next month to ease the global glut.\n\u201cThis may be too little and too late,\u201d S&P Global said.",

At the government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference on Saturday, Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary, said it was due to arrive in the next 24 hours.\nBut speaking on Sunday, Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, declined to say he could guarantee sufficient continuing supplies of PPE.\nAsked whether he could, he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show only that it was \u201cthe first priority of government\u201d to do so.\nGove added: \u201cIt is the case that there is a consignment of personal protection equipment that\u2019s arriving from Turkey, which contains tens of thousands of gowns.

The Wembley grounds manager would have waited for the Euro 2020 finalists to finish their warm-ups and then, with the turf briefly clear, would have set to work one final time before kick-off.\n\u201cYou\u2019re stood in the middle of the pitch and you\u2019ve got four or five minutes to water it and make sure everything is good to go,\u201d he says, remembering past finals from his 15 years working at the national stadium. \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling. You\u2019re there in front of 90,000 people doing the job you are so passionate about. It\u2019s a spine-tingling moment.\u201d\nThat moment has now been deferred for a year as Wembley, which had been gearing up for its most important summer since the venue\u2019s second incarnation opened in 2007, lies empty save for the skeleton support staff keeping things ticking along. Standley has split his staff into two smaller groups, working alternate shifts, in order to maintain the surface safely and it is fair to say nobody had this in mind during the winter months when they undertook Wembley\u2019s biggest pitch renovation in years.\nThe hybrid surface had its debut at the Carabao Cup final and would have been used 19 more times between the start of the Covid-19 shutdown and mid-July \u2013 taking in the March international break, the FA Cup semi-finals, the period Standley calls \u201cMad May\u201d and seven European Championship games \u2013 but must now await its moment like everywhere else.\nIt is a problem groundstaff from the biggest stadiums to park pitches have had to get their heads around: how to manage their turf through a period of inactivity that could stretch to unprecedented proportions.\nFor some there was the hint of a blessing, because well-used surfaces were given a chance to breathe after a February that was the fifth-wettest on record. For Standley, the break is a chance to extend the \u201ctest-drive\u201d phase for the Wembley pitch. He views it as yet another challenge, rather than a hindrance, but admits a sense of impatience.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a new pitch and I\u2019m looking to see it played on,\u201d he says. \u201cGrounds managers will never admit that \u2013 they\u2019re usually saying they want to give it rest time or recovery \u2013 but with a new one you\u2019re just looking forward to using it. The pitch was in good condition at the first game and it had been grown in with artificial lights though the winter. Now we only have 20 metres of shade and the rest is natural sunlight so I\u2019m very excited for the next game, whenever that may be.\u201d\nFor now, everyone has to recalibrate. Standley says it would take 20 unattended days for the 980m blades of grass on Wembley\u2019s pitch to begin deteriorating but he is able to apply a level of attention that makes that unthinkable. When not working at the stadium he can monitor from home variables such as humidity within the venue, moisture on the grass and oxygen levels in the soil, which itself contains fertilisers. Most of his peers do not have those options but the attitude throughout the industry has been resoundingly positive.\n\u201cGrounds managers are a resolute group and used to working in extreme conditions,\u201d says Geoff Webb, the chief executive of the Grounds Management Association. \u201cI think we all took a sharp intake of breath in the first few weeks of new working practices but there\u2019s been a steely determination and a real can-do attitude.\n\u201cAt more of a grassroots level it\u2019s hard, because sometimes you have one-man-band contractors and they simply can\u2019t afford not to operate. Taking an outdoors industry and telling them to stay indoors goes against every natural instinct they\u2019ve got. It\u2019s tough but I think everyone has responded in a really responsible manner.\u201d\nThe fundamental importance of groundstaff can be seen in the fact that at some lower-league clubs they are \u2013 along perhaps with a media officer or two \u2013 the only non-playing employees not to have been furloughed. It is a tight-knit circuit and Standley is part of a WhatsApp group that includes grounds managers from throughout the divisions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all really come together,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is really open. We\u2019ve been talking about our plans for the next few weeks and supporting each other wherever we can. If anyone has a problem, they can share it and know they have colleagues who will help.\u201d\nThe days pass more quickly with that outlook but nothing can quite replace the sense of anticipation for events that can represent the apex of a career\u2019s work.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what drives us as grounds teams: the adrenaline,\u201d Standley says. \u201cIt\u2019s the three or four days leading up to a cup final when you\u2019re tweaking the pitch in terms of its playability. Then you see the teams go out there, watch the first ball skid off the surface in the warm-up, see the players look at each other and can tell it\u2019s a quick pitch that delivers for the event. It feels incredible and then you look forward to the next one.\n\u201cRight now, we have to be positive. What\u2019s happening at the moment makes us understand how lucky we are and will make everything so much sweeter when these occasions return. Working in a stadium full of smiling people who are happy to be back there \u2013 that will be the main thing.\u201d",

        "content": "Speeding the game up, decluttering the calendar and introducing a Club World Championship should be considered\nJust a couple of months ago we were inside the rugby bubble. The Six Nations was coming towards a conclusion and domestic competitions were in full swing all over the world. We were saturated by the sport and we were comfortable, and when that happens you can start to pick holes.\nOver the past few years, highlighting rugby\u2019s problems has become a popular thing to do. I admit I have been among the more vocal in that sense but it has become widespread. There is a temptation at the moment to just will rugby back, warts and all, because players will be desperate to play and fans desperate to see some action, but it is important to resist.\nAs and when rugby does return we need to see it in its best light. This feels like a seminal moment, an opportunity to reset and reboot and we have to accept that change never happens spontaneously. You almost need a moment like this to be able to reflect, declutter and broaden your perspective as to where we\u2019re at, where we\u2019ve been and where we want to go.\nThis is not the time to rip up the lawbook and start again but it is the time to start applying the laws properly. To name just a few issues, we should look at ruck entry, players going off their feet, box-kicking, reset scrums, players goading each other and backchat to referees. I would like to see rugby borrow from cricket where teams are fined for slow over-rates. It is in the lawbook that you need to set a scrum with 30 seconds, or a lineout within 30 seconds, or take a kick at goal within a certain amount of time. If those laws are flouted I want to see fines handed out \u2013 either financial or in terms of points. We\u2019re trying to protect our sport and make it as viewer-friendly as possible \u2013 that has to underpin every change rugby makes. We have seen that changing behaviours is possible. Sam Warburton\u2019s red card in the 2011 World Cup semi-final is a good example and I believe Jared Payne\u2019s 2014 sending-off against Saracens in Europe is another. There are a few easy quick fixes that would make the game quicker, slicker and more attractive to viewers.\nA uniform global calendar that works for both hemispheres makes all the more sense in the current climate. Try explaining to someone who does not follow rugby just why we have a block of Premiership matches at the start of the season, then a couple of European fixtures and then a November series. I love watching the autumn internationals but at times like this you can take a step back, look at things with more perspective and ask why they exist. You have southern-hemisphere players at the end of their seasons and the north near the start of theirs \u2013 everyone is in a different mental and physical state. I\u2019d like to see a block of international matches grouped together where club competitions go on hold and I\u2019d like those Tests to be meaningful. At club level, let\u2019s introduce the Club World Championship. At a World Cup you have to play seven games if you want to win it and what better way to prepare players for that level of intensity than doing so with their clubs? The clubs would get better value out of knowing they have their players for an extended period of time. A Club World Championship has been mentioned before but the reaction was lukewarm at best.\nIn order to achieve that, however, there must be greater cooperation and compromise among the unions, the league and all stakeholders. Put simply, we cannot afford not to. Every union is undergoing financial hardship to varying levels but the Rugby Football Union is the richest in the world and is expecting losses of \u00a350m. All unions have to listen to one another, they have to hold hands \u2013 it almost feels like marriage counselling. The past 25 years, since professionalism was introduced, have been amazing, but we have to learn lessons to make the sport more economically sustainable. Let\u2019s look at the tier-two nations, who have always been in this situation. We\u2019re starting to understand their struggles. Fiji, Samoa or Tonga come up to Twickenham and get only \u00a350,000 for a game. Eyebrows are always raised but it then gets accepted and happens again.\nThe very first thing that must be addressed is the salary cap \u2013 that has to be reduced. The Premiership clubs made a collective loss of nearly \u00a350m last year and you cannot keep throwing money at debt. Moderating the salary cap would ensure the health of our clubs and a way to do that would be getting rid of the marquee players rule. If you have one player earning, say, \u00a3500,000 and he\u2019s a marquee but another player of similar ability who is not, that creates tension and drives up wages. I\u2019m sure players will read this and say: \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a player.\u201d I want every single player to be paid as much as they can in a sport which is absolutely brutal but the harsh reality is that I also want this sport to survive. Players are taking 25% wage cuts and the truth is that may well become the new norm.\nTaking things a step further, this may finally be the time to introduce central contracts. I wouldn\u2019t say they are inevitable but I think a serious conversation about the issue is. It is a simple fact that in the current climate there will be major investors in our game who can help to bail out clubs and that comes with a cost. If the RFU provides financial help to the clubs they will want more control and a larger say and I think we are moving in the direction of central contracts. At the moment, clubs simply cannot afford to keep hold of their prized assets and I\u2019m not sure it is worth them doing so given the limited amount of time they have them for. The compensation that they get for producing world-class players through their academies is not enough. The owners would not like central contracts but their businesses will have been hit by the lockdown. Any reasonable way that the pressure can be relieved would be welcome.\nNone of the above can happen without the players and the most important aspect of rugby\u2019s return is their welfare. There are a huge number of games to be played and the cold, hard truth is that the players cannot be expected to fulfil all of the fixture backlog. The key is finding the middle ground where a return doesn\u2019t put a stress on the NHS, so it is inevitable that in the short-term rugby will be played behind closed doors. Ultimately, however, economics will play a big part in the return date because otherwise clubs will fold.",

Customers with funds in their accounts were unable to withdraw their money but, after an auction for the customer list, a statement from MoPlay in mid-March revealed it had been \u201cable to secure an arrangement whereby another operator will honour your cash balance, so that you can withdraw your funds and continue to play\u201d.\nIt added that if customers were registered in the UK or Ireland, \u201cBetFred will be in contact with you with details of how to set up an account with them and access your balance\u201d.\nAround 180,000 MoPlay accounts are understood to have migrated to BetFred a few weeks ago. However, it is unclear how many accounts did not make the switch, and several former MoPlay customers have approached Justice4Punters, an online forum that campaigns on issues affecting gamblers, to complain that their balances did not shift to BetFred despite their having accounts.\nThe accounts in question appear to have been \u201crestricted\u201d, either by BetFred or MoPlay, because the customers were considered unprofitable by the operator. The Guardian has seen details of two such accounts, including one with a MoPlay balance of \u00a327,000, which did not migrate to BetFred, while a third former customer of MoPlay, with a balance of \u00a3680, has complained that his BetFred account, which had made a lifetime profit of around \u00a3300, was closed by the bookmaker two days after the announcement of its deal to buy MoPlay\u2019s customer list.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received a fair number of complaints,\u201d Brian Chappell of Justice4Punters said. \u201cAll the complaints seem to have one thing in common, they have restricted betting accounts, be that with MoPlay and/or with BetFred. From what we\u2019ve been sent, it\u2019s certainly not clear to J4P why these customers are being treated differently, except it all seems rather commercially convenient.\u201d\nA BetFred spokesman said this week that the firm \u201ccould not confirm how many accounts did not migrate from MoPlay, as this information is not within our knowledge\u201d. The spokesman also said the bookmaker had \u201csuccessfully migrated circa 180k customers from MoPlay to BetFred, these customers reflect eligible customer accounts and specifically excluded self-excluded or frozen accounts. We did not conduct any due diligence on the profitability of individuals in the MoPlay customer database nor did we close any BetFred accounts to prevent migration of MoPlay balances.\n\u201cOur actions to date are 100% in accordance with the terms of the contract with the liquidator and for those customers who did not migrate we are directing them to the liquidator to submit a claim in the liquidation.\u201d\nThe problems faced by some former MoPlay customers also highlight the fact that the Gambling Commission allows operators to choose the level of protection \u2013 high, medium or not protected \u2013 afforded to deposits in the event of a firm going bust. This, the commission says, is \u201cbecause of the potentially high costs which may be passed on to the consumer\u201d.\nThe Horseracing Bettors Forum, an independent group which represents punters\u2019 interests, pointed out last month that only eight of 64 firms it surveyed offer a cast-iron guarantee that deposits will not be treated as part of the assets if it goes into liquidation. MoPlay opted for the lowest level of protection.\n\u201cOur inquiries into the MoPlay situation earlier this year established there was a significant risk that none of their customers would have received their funds,\u201d a spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said this week. \u201cPutting the interests of consumers first, we concluded that the sale of the customer database was the best option available for the vast majority of customers in what was an unusual and difficult situation.\u201d",

But are they really ready to get back to business? Probably not.\nThe world has changed and running a small business won\u2019t be the same in May as it was in February. Widespread testing is still not available. A consensus on coronavirus treatment has not been achieved. A vaccine is at least a year away. Politicians are desperate to get the economy moving again and in doing so will be risking a reignition of the virus. They are hoping that with a phased-in approach, they can limit this potential damage to the extent that our healthcare system will be able to manage.\nSmall businesses \u2013 retailers, merchants, shopkeepers, gym and hair salon owners \u2013 will be an instrumental part of this plan. If we fail, the consequences will be dire and may force us \u2013 like some cities in Japan \u2013 to revert back to isolation because of a second wave of infections. We don\u2019t want this to happen.\nBut unfortunately, and based on many conversations I\u2019ve had with clients and other small business owners, the steps they need to be taking to minimize this risk aren\u2019t happening either. Is your business really ready to reopen? How do you prepare? The good news is that there\u2019s a template to follow.\nAll you need to do is look at the many \u201cessential\u201d businesses \u2013 big and small \u2013 that have been operating throughout this pandemic. What have they been doing? One of my clients, the owner of a small distributor of industrial gases used in the healthcare industry, has created a safe workspace. No, it\u2019s not perfect. But it\u2019s a model that we should all emulate if we want to restart the right way.\nHe\u2019s assigned a worker to do daily temperature checks of all of his employees. He\u2019s requiring workers to stay at least six feet apart and has moved around furniture to accomplish this. He\u2019s purchased gallons of sanitizer and strongly \u2013 no, forcefully \u2013 encourages employees to sanitize frequently. He\u2019s issued rules for congregating in break and lunch rooms and has workers wiping down common surfaces throughout the day. He\u2019s required that all employees wear masks inside, throughout the day and frequently communicates the federal emergency leave benefits available to his workers (his company has decided on a \u201cno argument\u201d policy if they need to stay home). He tells me he will aggressively acquire kits to test all of his employees as soon as they\u2019re available. He\u2019s continuing to have as many employees as possible work from home.\nNo, this isn\u2019t fun. But it\u2019s a heckuva lot safer. This is what all small businesses need to be doing when they reopen. In addition to the safety of our employees, we must also be considering the safety of our customers. Which means limiting and controlling the flow \u2013 like grocery stores have been doing \u2013 of store traffic, diners and patrons. Will this also limit revenues? Yes, it will. Will it create additional costs? Yes it will. But doing this will not only hopefully sustain our businesses but speed up the time it will take for us all to get through this pandemic and get back to growth and profitability.\nIf your business is shut and you\u2019re sitting at home, this is what you should be thinking about. Things are going to reopen soon and it\u2019s your job and mine is to make sure we have created a safe environment for both our customers and employees. This summer is not going to be a profitable summer. But if all businesses do their part, we will contribute towards keeping the risk of increased infections low. That will be good news for both public health and the economy.",

        "content": "Exclusive: Staff warn NHS provides specialised procedures that private providers cannot because of costs or complexity\nThe UK\u2019s oldest NHS fertility clinic is at risk of closure and another has been put out to private tender, as IVF provision is increasingly privatised and rationed.\nHospital bosses want to close the internationally renowned department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Manchester, saying they cannot afford to fund a \u00a310m upgrade of the unit, the Guardian has learned.\nIn Leeds, the entire NHS provision of fertility and other gynaecology services was put out to tender earlier this year, with private clinics invited to bid for a 10-year contract estimated at \u00a370m to provide reproductive care.\nTwo years ago North Bristol NHS trust sold off its IVF clinic to a private provider, saying it was no longer feasible because of a reduction in NHS-funded patients.\nIn England, the proportion of fertility treatment funded by the NHS dropped from 39% in 2012 to 35% in 2017, according to figures published last year by the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). This is at odds with the rest of the UK, where public funding has remained stable or increased.\nWhen it opened in 1982, four years after the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in nearby Oldham, St Mary\u2019s was the UK\u2019s first fully NHS funded IVF unit. It now performs over 2,000 fertility treatments every year, including around 1,200 IVF cycles, and offers highly specialised fertility preservation for cancer patients. It is also a top research centre, which led on the use of ovarian reserve tests to guide ovarian stimulation, the development of stem cell lines from human embryos, and the effects of IVF on baby birth weights.\nThe Manchester University NHS foundation trust (MFT) said no decisions had been made over the unit\u2019s future. But staff were briefed last month that the HFEA and local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) had been told that all licensed treatment and research on the site may end by April 2021 if an alternative solution cannot be found.\nMFT, which runs the hospital, is also exploring options including redeploying services and some of its 107 staff \u2013 including many highly specialised roles \u2013 but confirmed to staff that closure was a possibility.\nThe Guardian spoke to 10 members of staff at St Mary\u2019s aware of the mooted closure. One said they understood the matter to be settled: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s have taken a proposal to the MFT group board to discontinue the IVF service and the group board have said, \u2018Yes, OK.\u2019 How they discontinue it is what they need to decide next,\u201d they said.\nIf the change goes ahead, CCGs, which fund fertility treatment, will have to pay private clinics to carry out IVF and other fertility services. But staff at St Mary\u2019s warn that the private sector will not be able to carry out some of the most specialised services currently offered by the NHS.\n\u201cWe offer highly specialised procedures in the NHS which private providers won\u2019t touch because they don\u2019t make money and are too difficult. For example, we aim to see women diagnosed with cancer within a week who want to freeze their eggs before they start chemotherapy. Many of these women are already very poorly and need really high quality anaesthetic care during egg collection, and that is just not available in the private sector because of the medical complications,\u201d said one source.\nThey added: \u201cPrivate clinics are also unlikely to help patients with kidney problems or heart problems. But when they come to us, we can address these issues before they begin IVF: a huge advantage of being part of a multi-disciplinary NHS Trust. Those patients will be disadvantaged if this happens.\u201d\nThey also expressed concerns about screening procedures in the private sector. In the NHS, anyone applying for fertility treatment undergoes a series of stringent checks, including an assessment of the welfare of the child: \u201cOur checks and ethics advisory committee often flag issues including prison sentences, a serious history of domestic violence, even people on the sex offender register. At private clinics they don\u2019t do anything like the same background checks.\u201d\nA number of separate proposals were put to MFT to try to save some or all of the clinic, including turning the service into a social enterprise and forming a partnership with a private provider, as is being proposed in Leeds.\nThe deadline to apply to run the Leeds service was 23 March, the day the government announced the coronavirus lockdown in the UK. Shortly afterwards, clinics stopped all new treatments and the HFEA ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April.\nA spokesperson for the MFT, which runs St Mary\u2019s hospital, said no decision had been taken to shut the clinic permanently.\nThey said: \u201cServices provided by the department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital are regularly reviewed as part of a usual cycle to ensure that we continue to provide the best possible care and treatments for all our service users. No decisions have been made, therefore it would be inappropriate to provide any further detail before the outcome of any review has been finalised.\u201d\nThe HFEA said it could not disclose informal discussions between clinics and inspectors.\nMany St Mary\u2019s staff are worried not just about their patients and their jobs, but the logistics of closing down the clinic. Moving thousands of sperm samples and embryos held in freezers, for use in both treatment and research, was a \u201cmind-boggling\u201d challenge, said one.\nOne staff member said: \u201cAlthough possible relocation was mentioned, the fact that no viable alternative has been identified and that the cost was described as being too high left us thinking that this is not being explored and that closing the unit is the direction of travel. We are worried for our jobs but our biggest concern is for our patients, particularly those with the most complex needs who cannot be served elsewhere without high costs.\u201d\nIVF provision has been put under pressure, nationally, by NHS funding cuts over the past decade leading to a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d of provision. Now only a minority of English CCGs offer the recommended three funded IVF cycles, with some refusing to fund any NHS fertility treatment at all.",

Estimates are that between 700 and 800 personnel will still be needed on site at events.\nThe rigorous testing procedures will involve players, caddies and officials being sent testing kits \u2013 already on mass order \u2013 to their homes, with a further and immediate check required if anyone has travelled to a tournament by air. Daily tests will subsequently be undertaken by each individual in tournament week, with anyone returning a positive result asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.\nThe Tour events are likely to be very different to those in pre-coronavirus times, with locker rooms and player dining facilities unavailable.\nThe Ryder Cup remains in its original position of late September at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin. Talks regarding the viability of playing the biennial competition \u2013 with or without fans \u2013 are due to continue this week. The qualification processes for the USA and Europe teams will also be up for discussion.\nTesting procedures were a key topic as Trump addressed the nation on Friday. The US president claimed the country had already carried out almost 3.8m tests. It is unclear precisely what type of kits the Tour has on order \u2013 or what level can be delivered \u2013 but both Trump and golf administrators have cited the usefulness of saliva tests, as recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but currently for emergency use only. Testing machines have been considered but are more likely to be used when the general public are permitted entry to tournaments again.\nOn Sunday a PGA Tour spokesman denied that the figure of one million tests was correct but added: \u201cThe Tour is still examining the issue of testing in consultation with leading medical experts. We have on numerous occasions said publicly that Covid-19 testing as it stands today is most critical across the healthcare world and in our communities.\u201d\nJay Monahan, the Tour\u2019s commissioner, has previously stressed the importance of mass testing and that golf should know its place in terms of national priorities. \u201cWe need to have widespread, large-scale testing across our country, where we are going to be able to test players, caddies and other constituents before we return,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to do so in a way that\u2019s not going to take away from the critical need [the country is] going to be facing.\u201d\nThe Tour estimates at least 25 of its member players and 35 caddies are currently outside the US. If border restrictions are not eased by mid-June, there is an understanding these individuals will still be granted entry if due at a golf tournament. What this means in respect of returns to their home bases is unclear.\nMonahan joined a group of leading sports commissioners in discussion with Trump last week. A similar meeting took place in early April. The NBA, in stark contrast, remains circumspect about a return to competition. \u201cWe are not in a position to make any decisions,\u201d said Adam Silver, its commissioner, on Friday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unclear when we will be.\u201d\nThe first major of this golf season, the US PGA Championship, is due to take place in a rescheduled slot from 6 August. There remains scepticism whether Harding Park in San Francisco will be able to stage the event. Valhalla in Kentucky and Hazeltine in Minnesota \u2013 host to the 2016 Ryder Cup \u2013 are among the back-up options.\nThe European Tour, which is also mindful of necessary testing protocols upon a possible August restart, is expected to issue schedule revisions in the coming days.",

        "content": "My mother, Shirley Williams, who has died aged 86, worked as a nurse to improve the lives of patients and then, in retirement, as a volunteer for a range of charities, including Victim Support.\nBorn in Southend-on-Sea, Shirley was the daughter of Hugh Daniels, a tax inspector, and Jessie (nee Austen), a nursing aide during the first world war and later an administrator. In 1939, when the second world war broke out, Shirley was evacuated to Oxford. Unlike some evacuees, she loved her temporary home in Charlbury Road, Oxford, with the Misses Huxley, or \u201cAunts\u201d, whom we as a family continued to visit during the 1960s.\nAfter leaving St Faith\u2019s school in Oxford, aged 17, Shirley trained as a nurse, initially at the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital, Stanmore, Harrow, in the 1950s and then at the Royal Masonic hospital in west London. She met Brian Williams while training at the Royal Masonic and used to make us laugh with her tales of climbing up drainpipes to get into the nurses\u2019 home after curfew. They married in 1957 and, as nurses then had to be single to practise, Shirley stopped work. The couple lived initially in Watford, Hertfordshire, and then Amersham, in Buckinghamshire. Shirley went on to have a son, Kevin, who died at birth, and four daughters.\nIn 1972 Shirley was able to return to nursing, initially as a health visitor when we were still young, supported by a succession of au pairs. She then worked as an endoscopy nurse at Wexham Park hospital, Berkshire, and finally, from 1990, as a manager of British Nursing Association offices in Watford and Bosham, West Sussex, until retiring in 1998.\nHowever it was in her retirement, in Shenley, near Watford, where she showed her commitment to service in the community, volunteering for Victim Support and for 13 years serving on the Patient Group at the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital. For 15 years she worked at the Hertfordshire local archives once a week. When she could no longer drive to Hertford, aged 85, she volunteered for the National Archives online.\nA keen sportswoman, Shirley continued into her 80s to swim and play tennis.\nBrian died in 2005. Shirley is survived by her daughters, Karen, Suzanne, Sian and me, and nine grandchildren.",

        "content": "Government\u2019s 100,000-a-day pledge was only designed to be a headline grabber, claim sceptics\nThe government\u2019s target of carrying out 100,000 Covid-19 tests each day by the end of the month has come under criticism from senior scientists, who say it will be impossible to reach.\nExperts told the Guardian that a \u201cmacho\u201d focus on headline-grabbing figures had been pursued at the expense of rigorous science.\nThe Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said on Sunday that the government was confident that the goal of 100,000 tests daily by the end of April would be met.\nHowever, scepticism is building. On Saturday, only 21,626 tests were carried out.\nPaul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he viewed the target as impossible. \u201cI cannot see that being achieved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always designed to be a headline grabber rather than anything else.\u201d\nOthers said a relentless focus on the number of tests performed each day had led to basic data reporting standards falling by the wayside. Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the Medical Research Council\u2019s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge, said: \u201cThe level of incompetence in reporting these tests is outrageous.\u201d\nGove acknowledged on Sunday that the target referred to tests carried out. In the past fortnight the government has placed a growing emphasis on \u201ctesting capacity\u201d. It said that although fewer than 22,000 tests were performed on Saturday, labs now had the capacity to carry out 38,000 tests daily, and this had not been fully taken up by hospitals.\nScientists said the distinction was misleading as the logistics of having enough doctors and nurses on the ground to perform swab tests and send off samples continued to be a challenge. \u201cHaving the capacity is just the first step,\u201d said Bill Hanage, a British epidemiologist based at Harvard.\nBird said the failure to give breakdowns of how many tests were being carried out on patients in hospital, critical workers and family members of critical workers made it impossible to extract prevalence rates of infection in these different groups and other crucial information that would allow scientists to more accurately assess the status of the outbreak in the UK.\n\u201cThis macho thing about the number of tests done each day is leading to a reporting standard that makes the data almost uninterpretable,\u201d she said.\nIdeally, she said, tests would be reported separately for these different groups and would take into account the fact that hospitalised patients typically have a sequence of three tests over several weeks \u2013 an initial positive test followed by two negative tests (the second negative for assurance that the recovering patient is no longer infectious and can be transferred home or to a general ward).\n\u201cReporting the number of tests performed each day is a political requirement, not a scientific requirement,\u201d she added.\nHanage said that even if the 100,000 target were met, this figure was not a relevant measure of the adequacy of the UK\u2019s testing operation. \u201cAiming for a large number that sounds good is not the way you should be doing this,\u201d he said.\nThat around a third of those tested in the UK this week had positive results suggests that, while useful for guiding medical treatment, current testing is far below the levels that would be needed for population surveillance.\n\u201cThe data I\u2019ve been seeing suggests there\u2019s not anywhere near enough testing,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cThe way you should be doing it is to build the capacity and ability to run large numbers of tests \u2013 enough that only 10% are coming back positive.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly urged governments to pursue testing and tracing, and some countries, including Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used this approach to contain their outbreaks, while Germany has also continued to carry out contact tracing.\nThe UK abandoned population testing and contact tracing in early March, when case numbers began to rise steeply, but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Friday that contact tracing would be reintroduced, including through a proposed NHS smartphone app.\nExperts say the ability to rely on this approach to safely exit the lockdown will depend critically on widespread population testing beyond the level needed for diagnosing patients in hospital.",

        "content": "Readers on the shocking lack of personal protective equipment and government ineptitude that is leading to the deaths of frontline staff\nI am a retired consultant paediatrician. My beautiful, intelligent and brave son, daughter-in-law and niece are frontline junior doctors. One works in an ICU where, like around a third of staff, he does not have a respirator mask that fits, or adequate supplies of eye protection. Another is on a Covid-19 palliative care ward for the elderly, and the third works on long-stay psychiatric wards; both are caring for symptomatic patients who understand nothing of not having direct physical contact. They are told by managers not to make a fuss when they ask for FFP3 masks, long-sleeve gowns and visors.\nOver 50 NHS staff have now died from this infection. I think we will look back and see that it is not only the failure to stockpile equipment, the privatisation of NHS logistics, the dependency on importing foreign-made personal protective equipment, and the inability to rapidly repurpose local industry, but also the inadequacy of Public Health England recommendations in terms of protecting staff, that will have led to many avoidable deaths. I am staggered to read that some senior figures in NHS England regard PHE advice as \u201cexcessive\u201d (NHS staff told \u2018wear aprons\u2019 as protective gowns run out, 17 April). I wonder whether their opinion would change if they did a shift with one of my young relatives?Dr John PuntisCo-chair, Keep Our NHS Public\n So the government has finally admitted that PPE is running out (PPE including gowns and masks running out, admits UK government, 18 April). It has done nothing but lie for weeks. PPE has been insufficient since this crisis began, as you are reporting on an almost daily basis. How many health professionals and social care workers have died already due to lack of adequate protection?\nYou report that the government has ordered 400,000 gowns from Turkey. But you say the NHS needs 150,000 gowns a day, so this new order will last less than three days \u2013 if it exists, if it ever arrives. Then what? When will the next order be placed? Why isn\u2019t everyone shouting about this? The incompetence is stunning. Everyone must support an all-NHS strike. They have every right to protection. Then let\u2019s clap.Marge BererLondon\n Like John Crace (The politics sketch, 14 April), I listened to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey with mounting disbelief on Tuesday; I heard her on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. My 78-year-old husband is in a local care home with late-stage Alzheimer\u2019s. The staff are heroic, having moved on-site, sleeping in a borrowed caravan and a tent two weeks at a time, 24/7, to minimise risk of the virus entering the care home. Despite this, the home now has two potential cases of Covid-19, but testing was only available when there were five or more suspected cases. There are 16 residents, so this meant that one-third had to show symptoms before this happens, if then. (Matt Hancock has since said testing will be made available for all care home staff and residents, but no deadline has been given for this to be implemented.)\nIn addition, staff are wearing homemade face shields kindly produced by a local primary school on its 3D printer. Support from the community is invaluable, but it is no substitute for effective clinical PPE for frontline staff. The NHS has now grudgingly agreed to provide masks in addition to the usual gloves and flimsy aprons, but the lack of systematic testing for care staff and those in vulnerable communities is a disgrace. Coffey\u2019s words on being well prepared are meaningless unless action follows.Ann JollyEmsworth, Hampshire\n As the mistakes this government has made regarding the supply of PPE are becoming clearer by the day (UK missed three chances to join EU scheme to bulk-buy PPE, 13 April), so too is the need for transparency, accountability and a proper apology. The stubborn refusal of MPs to admit to their failings \u2013 or offer a sincere apology \u2013 has shocked even those of us who were willing to give the government the benefit of the doubt for the sake of national unity.\nIt\u2019s the actions and words of figures like Matt Hancock and Priti Patel that reveal the true nature of the Conservative party\u2019s attitude towards the NHS, not hollow displays of solidarity performed on the steps of 10 Downing Street. My wife, a frontline NHS worker, does not want this government\u2019s applause. Like her colleagues, she simply wants the equipment she needs to do her job safely. In the absence of that, she wants our elected representatives to be transparent and accountable. And that starts with a proper apology.Andy MooreLeeds\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

In some regions they are infected and hospitalized at up to three times the rate of white Americans, a Guardian analysis found.\nIn a survey conducted across 14 US states, the CDC recently found that 33% of people who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 were African American, yet they represented only around 13% of the population of those states. According to research from Johns Hopkins University. of 26 states reporting racial data, African Americans account for 34% of Covid-related deaths.\n\u201cThe facts are sobering, they\u2019re depressing and they\u2019re tragic,\u201d said musician and entrepreneur Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs during CNN\u2019s The Color of Covid one-hour special on Saturday night. \u201cAfrican Americans helped to build this country and make this country great.

Many are unable to access healthcare systems and unemployment benefits that could bring relief.\nFerrera drew attention to US farmworkers, around 80% of whom identify as Latino, according to Farmworker Justice.\n\u201cI want to say \u2018thank you\u2019 from the bottom of my heart to all,\u201d Ferrera said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting their lives and health on the line by planting, picking, and packing the food we all need.\u201d\nBut, she noted, \u201cfarmworkers are reporting that they do not have enough food to feed their own families. Even though the government has deemed them essential workers, they are being denied essential benefits.

Shipments trailed in advance that do not arrive increase anxiety among frontline staff and make it harder for hospitals to plan how best to keep their doctors and nurses from getting infected, bosses said.\n\u201cWe have, over the last 24 hours, seen an unhelpful focus on one individual consignment coming from Turkey. We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, [and] when,\u201d said Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers.\n\u201cGiven the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.\u201d\n\u201cBitter experience in recent weeks has shown that promised consignments of gowns cannot be relied on until they come, are checked and found to contain the right kit,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.\u201d\nTrust leaders privately admit that they are desperate to acquire more full-length waterproof surgical gowns. Hospitals have expressed gratitude to local vets, fire brigades, police forces, councils, DIY shops and builders\u2019 merchants after being forced to ask them to hand over their stocks of gowns. One received 2,000 from a nearby veterinary supply firm.\nOn Friday Hancock told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee that 55,000 more gowns were due that day. They arrived as expected and were distributed to hospitals over the weekend. However, NHS officials pointed out that, with hospital staff in England using 150,000 gowns a day, they constituted barely eight hours\u2019 supply.\nLondon hospitals are getting through 30,000 to 40,000 a day and major teaching hospital trusts, such as Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge and University Hospitals Birmingham need to use 3,000 to 4,000 each day, such is the demand caused by the pandemic.\nNiall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which also represents hospital trusts and other NHS providers, said the non-arrival of PPE from Turkey was \u201cvery serious\u201d and made a difficult situation worse. \u201cIt would have been better had the government not made the announcement in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know shipments in this supply chain are unreliable and even when they do arrive they are not always what is expected. In future the NHS will expect announcements when supplies have arrived, not promises about what may or may not be delivered.\u201d\nEchoing Hopson\u2019s concern, Dickson added that unfulfilled promises from ministers about PPE caused problems.\n\u201cWe accept that this is difficult for everyone, but we now need action, not words. There was already a loss of confidence and real anxiety across the NHS and care system around PPE supply. This will have been further eroded by what has happened this weekend. It will not be restored until we have a stable supply chain and certainty that staff will be given what they need when they need it. At the moment we are a long way from that point.\u201d\nAs the number of NHS staff who have died from coronavirus rose to 77, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, leader of the British Medical Association, said: \u201cThis really is a matter of life and death. In what is an incredibly challenging time, doctors and healthcare staff should feel as equipped and supported as they need to be able to deliver care for patients. Instead, they are left fearful for their own health and safety \u2013 this is shameful.\u201d\nThe Intensive Care Society, Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, Royal College of Anaesthetists and Association of Anaesthetists joined a growing medical backlash against new PPE guidelines issued by Public Health England on Friday. In a joint statement, they said concern about lack of PPE was so great that some doctors may decide not to take the risk of treating infected patients.\nThey said that, given the flaws in PHE\u2019s advice, \u201cWe think clinicians should carefully evaluate the risks before taking a decision about whether to provide care, and should discuss a decision not to provide care with a colleague.\n\u201cIf shortages continue or worsen, our members will face increasingly difficult decisions. This will involve balancing the safety of patients against their personal safety and that of other staff, those they return home to after work, and patients they may treat in the future.\u201d\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cAdequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic. Our stockpiles and planning have allowed us to deliver nearly 1bn pieces of protective equipment to the frontline so far. We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need.\u201d",

The Guardian is aware of at least 58 private and NHS healthcare staff who have died from coronavirus.\nDave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said: \u201cThis is the ultimate tribute to remember workers who\u2019ve lost their lives and put themselves in harm\u2019s way to keep us safe and vital services running.\n\u201cEvery year the sacrifice of workers around the world is recognised but this year has a special significance because of the pandemic.\n\u201cThousands of key staff are on the frontline while the rest of us are in lockdown. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve issued this call for the whole country to take part and remember the sacrifices they\u2019ve made. The best tribute we can all pay them is to stay inside to protect the NHS.\n\u201cThe minute\u2019s silence is a thank you to all the workers including nurses, midwives, cleaners and care staff who\u2019ve died from this devastating virus.\u201d\nUnison, the RCN and RCM represent more than a million NHS and public service workers collectively. These include porters, refuse collectors and care staff.\nThe unions cited the success of the nationwide Clap for Our Carers campaign, with applause every Thursday at 8pm to pay homage to NHS and key workers.\nDonna Kinnair, the RCN general secretary and chief executive, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve become used to hearing a great roar on a Thursday night for key workers, but this respectful silence will be a poignant reminder of the risks they run to keep us safe.\n\u201cI hope the public gets behind this with the same affection they show when applauding our people.\n\u201cThe silence is a simple show of respect for those who have paid the very highest price but their loved ones must know the levels of gratitude we feel as a nation and take some comfort from that.\u201d\nGill Walton, the RCM chief executive and general secretary, said: \u201cWe had expected 2020 to be a celebration of the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife but, although we actively applaud their service, this is not what we had imagined.\n\u201cInstead, across the country, midwives and maternity support workers are seeing the impact of coronavirus not only on the women in their care but on their colleagues as well.\u201d\nThe call comes after the Unite union paid tribute on 17 April to bus and transport workers in London who died after contracting the virus.",

        "content": "Lockdown decluttering has led me down a path to the fascinating, well-lived life of a larrikin named Aubrey Hodgson\nA recent lockdown clear-out prompted the discovery of a semi-skimmed and long-forgotten letter forwarded to me by my mother some years ago; a piece of correspondence she had chanced upon while doing some domestic decluttering of her own. It had been written by my uncle, a former professor of anatomy at the University of Galway, during his days doing the rounds at a Sydney hospital way back in 1978.\nWriting to my father on the flimsiest of airmail notepaper, with a neatness of hand that belied his profession, he revealed that he had been lucky enough to get talking to \u201ca very interesting character\u201d the previous evening. A legendary figure known in Australian rugby circles as the Bull, Aubrey Hodgson had been singing the praises of the Ireland lock Willie John McBride and the Welsh fly-half Barry John, two titans of the northern hemisphere game the former Wallabies forward, then aged 66, hugely admired.\nUpon being informed that my uncle had a five\u2011year\u2011old nephew back in Ireland who had been named after the Welshman in a fit of what is probably best described as optimistic but utterly misguided paternal delusion, Hodgson was handed a pen and scribbled a message to the boy.\n\u201cTo Barry John Glendenning,\u201d reads the message on the back of a Christmas card from the then president of the Irish Rugby Football Union. \u201cBe as great as John McBride the greatest of all Irish forwards. Please be as great. Aub Hodgson [The Bull].\u201d\nMore than 40 years later, it was rather chastening to learn that it hadn\u2019t just been my old man who I had gone on to let down through a combination of bumbling ineptitude and cowardice on the rugby field.\nSubsequent research revealed that old Aub was indeed quite the fascinating character. A bit of a mad bastard, by all accounts. Described in my uncle\u2019s letter as \u201ca physical wreck now getting about on crutches and drinking like a fish but still enjoying life\u201d, he would die four years later. A stalwart of Manly rugby club in Sydney, first as a player then a coach, he was the recipient of an excellent send-off.\nIn his book Inside the Wallabies, the Australian writer Greg Growden fondly recalls the standing ovation given to the Bull as his coffin disappeared behind the curtains at Sydney\u2019s Northern Suburbs crematorium. \u201cHe was forever surrounded by revellers who were charmed by his reminiscences, his outlandish behaviour, his vast football knowledge and his eagerness to be the ultimate host to any visiting player,\u201d he wrote.\nBorn into a privileged background in 1912 and the only one of six brothers to be given the kind of name that makes a certain teak-toughness on the rugby field an absolute necessity, Hodgson won 11 caps for Australia. This deceptively low tally was nothing to do with any lack of ability on his part, but more a testament to the infrequency with which his country played. It didn\u2019t help that his international career was interrupted and ultimately ended by the outbreak of the second world war.\nThe Australasian rugby writer and historian Spiro Zavos recalls Hodgson being \u201cas good as any contemporary player anywhere in the world at his peak in the 1930s\u201d, describing him as \u201ca snarler of a loose forward who terrorised opposition backs and sometimes his own with the fury and aggression of his play\u201d.\nOne image from the archives shows him squaring up to the South Africa prop Harry Martin, who was looking for revenge following a number Hodgson had done on his semi-conscious teammate, the scrum-half Pierre de Villiers.\nA versatile back-row merchant who began life as a prop, Hodgson made his first Test appearance against South Africa at Durban in 1933 and his 11th and final one against New Zealand just over five years later. History suggests he could and should have made a lot more. A member of the Wallabies squad that disembarked at Southampton on 2 September 1939, he would certainly have got to test himself against northern-hemisphere opposition but for Britain\u2019s declaration of war against Germany the next day. Instead, his final duties as a an Australia player involved turning up for an audience with King George VI and a brief period spent filling sandbags before a fraught voyage home keeping a watchful eye out for U-boats.\nHodgson volunteered for the Second Australian Imperial Force but his service was delayed by a broken leg sustained the next day while playing for Manly against Drummoyne. Despite announcing his retirement in 1944, he did not stay out of the game for long and excelled in state trials before Australia\u2019s 1946 tour of New Zealand. Surprisingly, he failed to make the squad.\n\u201cI heard he had the letters NTTA indelibly marked against his name \u2013 Never To Tour Again,\u201d wrote a fellow international, Professor Max Howell, in a memoir. \u201cI suspect the rumour was correct that somewhere and some time on tour he had overstepped the bounds of propriety.\u201d\nAlthough Hodgson had dirtied his bib, he remained much loved in his native land due in no small part to his reputation as a hell-raiser. Fond of a bet, he once challenged the Australia Test cricketer Sid Barnes to a popularity contest, inviting him to stand alongside him in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place during Monday rush hour to see which of them would be recognised and greeted by the most passers-by.\n\u201cAub won that bet by about 50 people,\u201d Growden would later write, before lamenting the fact the player became \u201ca bit dotty in his old age, welcoming visiting teams at Sydney airport in his pyjamas and donning his dressing gown when he flew to interstate matches\u201d.\nIt may well have been that version of Hodgson my uncle bumped into in Sydney, when he got the autograph for the five-year-old me. \u201cSome day Barry may get a kick out of having it,\u201d he wrote to my father. A kick, certainly. And an education on the subject of a fascinating life well lived by a nails-hard larrikin named Aubrey.",

        "content": "Heightened anxiety around financial insecurity can be compounded by isolation from teammates and interruptions to training routines\nLeading medical journal The Lancet recently published a position paper authored by 24 mental health experts. It begins: \u201cIt is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic are pervasive and could affect mental health now and in the future.\u201d\nIt is a hypothesis substantiated by Professional Footballers Australia who last week published findings of a survey of over 150 of its members. Since the suspension of professional football in Australia, 58% of players have reported symptoms of anxiety while 45% demonstrated symptoms of depression. Ordinarily, moderate-to-severe anxiety reporting peaks at about 8%.\n\u201cThe hardest thing is the uncertainty,\u201d Central Coast Mariners striker Matt Simon tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from being around teammates every single day and training every day to all of a sudden just being stood down without pay and no word on what\u2019s going to be happening and no word on when the next payment is coming for everyone\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d\nSuch uncertainty must now be prevalent in most workforces, making the insight into professional sportspeople all the more instructive. This is a cohort synonymous with high achievement, resilience and an abundance of positive reinforcement.\n\u201cI think there are a lot of misconceptions about professional athletes,\u201d Simon argues. \u201cI saw a story a couple of weeks ago saying that we shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for A-League players because they\u2019ve been stood down without pay. I thought that was an absolute joke, because what about the player that\u2019s sacrificed so much, is not on a lot of money, but he just does it because he loves the game and he\u2019s got three kids at home? Now all of a sudden he has no money coming in. They are stressful times for a player \u2013 how is he going to feed his kids?\u201d\nFootballers are the victims of greater uncertainty than professionals from other high-profile local sports. The shutdown arrived before the conclusion of drawn-out negotiations to decouple the A-League and W-League from Football Federation Australia. There has been some ad-hoc devolution but no clear resolution, leaving the game looking in many directions for answers.\nThe situation is made even more perilous by the reluctance of Fox Sports to continue its financial investment in Australian football. The broadcaster has indicated it is looking to withdraw from football as soon as possible, and the absence of matches to broadcast has provided it grounds to withhold the latest quarterly $12m payment to A-League clubs. A legal stoush looms. Little has been said on the record.\nWhat does that mean on the ground? \u201cThe silence from the governing bodies, not coming out and giving us any answers, I don\u2019t think is great,\u201d says Simon. \u201cObviously, some people know what\u2019s going on and discussions are behind closed doors. I think those people need to come out and say what\u2019s happening. If something doesn\u2019t happen sooner or later, like many people around the country, we\u2019re going to have to start looking at different avenues for employment.\u201d\nThere may be some comparisons to draw with the demise of the old National Soccer League, but the current crisis is arguably more acute, as Beau Busch, PFA\u2019s head of player development, outlines. \u201cWhen the NSL ended there were opportunities to play in the NPL, Asia, or Europe. The current level of uncertainty is unprecedented,\u201d he says.\nThis heightened anxiety around financial insecurity is compounded by isolation from teammates and interruptions to training routines, key pillars of an athlete\u2019s mental health. \u201cPlayers are used to being surrounded by people on a daily basis and there isn\u2019t really any substitute for that,\u201d Busch says.\nOr as Simon puts it: \u201cI think all players would be saying they miss the banter in the change room, when you play football for a long period of time your teammates pretty much become your family and you do take it for granted when it gets taken away from you.\u201d\nThe importance of camaraderie to mental health is not unique to the professional game. All across the country weekend warriors are now missing their fix of mateship.\n\u201cLocal sporting clubs play such an important community cohesion role around Australia and a tough side of the isolation requirements is the loss of the regular social and physical contact with fellow sporting club members,\u201d explains Dr Grant Blashki, Beyond Blue\u2019s lead clinical advisor.\n\u201cThere is good evidence that sporting activities are excellent for maintaining wellbeing because they usually combine physical exercise, social connectedness and routine, which are all very beneficial. Beyond Blue\u2019s evidence-based A Guide To What Works, which reviews treatments and strategies used to improve mental health, shows exercise can be of significant benefit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people to plan a weekly schedule in their calendar, including exercise, even if that just involves working out in front of a YouTube video or going for a walk on your own.\u201d\nBut before despair takes root, Dr Blashki has some words of reassurance. \u201cIt\u2019s important to maintain hope and focus on how good things are going to be when sporting codes get back to doing what they do best on the sporting field on the other side of the pandemic.\u201d",

So they missed the ruler\u2019s length of rope on the dusty road\nAt the secondary school where I normally work as a librarian, I take key workers\u2019 and other children on a \u201cnature mooch\u201d. We undull our senses. Outside the closed-off science block, we make \u201cdeer\u2019s ears\u201d, cupping our hands behind our ears and directing them at the noisy rookery-nursery. There are gasps at the enhanced volume.\nWe wander to the edges of the playing field, bordering farmland, and hear a skylark singing at what would be the height of the 100m sprint track, were it placed upright. We find muntjac slots \u2013 tiny, paired deer hoofprints \u2013 a badger-boundary latrine and consider the phrase \u201cecological niche\u201d when a kite tussles midair with a buzzard. There is a brief, talon-grappling fall through the air, before the birds are back in their own territorial airspace.\nI had wanted to show them slow-worms, Anguis fragilis. I know where they are, but we run out of time.\nI am assailed by a memory, walking my middle child to her last day at primary school. A slow-worm crossed our path and she picked it up. It wrapped its strong, burnished-copper body round her thin wrist like a protective amulet. We admired its faint, Mona Lisa smile, watched it blink and found its ears \u2013 pencilled brackets around its head; things that mark it out as a lizard, not a snake.\nMore recently, revising Macbeth for a GCSE she will never sit, my daughter and I realised that the witches\u2019 ingredient of a \u201cblind worm\u2019s sting\u201d was the shed end of the slow-worm\u2019s autotomised tail. It prompted the same memory in her, of her last day at primary school, and produced fresh tears at the denial of her last day at secondary school.\nThe students and I exchange pledges to stay safe. On the way home, there is a slow-worm on the dusty, deserted road: a school ruler\u2019s length of rope, which I might have missed had I not half expected to see one. I stop and pick it up. It coils its cool, tubular body around my wrist, just as one did my daughter\u2019s all those years ago.\nWith a greyer, polished, blue-flecked body, this one is a male. I wait for it to blink and release it, like a slipped bracelet, among the violets on the bank.",

        "content": "UK and Europe face growing inequality with layoffs hitting non-university educated\nWorkers without a university degree will be hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, raising fears of increasing inequality across Europe, where up to 59m jobs are at risk.\nNearly 80% of workers facing job insecurity \u2013 including cuts to hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs \u2013 do not have a university degree, according to new research by the consultancy firm McKinsey.\nPeople at risk include retail staff, cooks and actors, as well as construction workers and office support staff, who are twice as likely to see their livelihoods under threat during the outbreak because they work in close proximity to others and have significant exposure to the public.\nLow-insecurity occupations include workers who either do not need to work in close proximity to others, such as accountants, architects and journalists, or whose work provide essential health services, such as healthcare staff or other essential services such as police, food production, education, public transport, or utilities.\nThe research raises concerns that the coronavirus outbreak could widen the gap between rich and poor across the EU and UK. \u201cShort-term job risk is highly correlated with level of education, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities,\u201d McKinsey said.\nThe warning came as Britain\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme starts accepting applications for government support from firms that have furloughed their staff.\nWhile many countries, including the UK, have rolled out massive stimulus programmes to help soften the economic blow of national lockdowns, McKinsey warned that Europe could still face social unrest as a result of rising unemployment.\n\u201cSocieties\u2019 inequalities are exacerbated by higher unemployment rates, as social-welfare systems cannot fully alleviate the negative effects of a loss of employment. Increases in crime rates and social unrest are also potential consequences of an increase in unemployment,\u201d McKinsey said.\n\u201cMoreover, unemployed people are twice as likely to experience mental illness (and even more so for blue-collar workers), and they receive inpatient treatment more often,\u201d the report added.\nIn the UK alone, up to 11 million people could end up furloughed or unemployed over the next three months, according to separate research by the Resolution Foundation, which also showed that low-paid workers would be hardest hit.\nBut the foundation said that the UK\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme \u2013 in which the government will pay for 80% of a worker\u2019s pay, up to \u00a32,500 per month \u2013 has so far shielded the UK from the worst-case economic shock. The foundation\u2019s economist, Daniel Tomlinson, said the scheme \u201cis what stands between Britain experiencing high unemployment over the coming months and catastrophic Great Depression-era levels of long-term joblessness.\n\u201cIt is proving particularly essential in big, low-paying sectors like hospitality and retail, where around half the workforce are no longer working,\u201d he added.\nAround 46% of workers in the UK hospitality and retail sectors are expected to be furloughed, compared with just 4% of employees in the highest-paid sector, insurance and finance.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce estimates that two-thirds of firms have furloughed some of their staff. \u201cThe opening of the job retention scheme is an important milestone for businesses, who can now begin to access the cash they need to pay their staff and protect livelihoods,\u201d the BCC director general, Adam Marshall, said.\nThe McKinsey research also found that young employees between the ages of 15 and 24 are also twice as likely to face job instability during the outbreak compared with their older counterparts. However, Sebastian Stern, a senior partner at McKinsey, said the long-term impact on young workers would hinge on how quickly governments start to exit lockdown measures.\n\u201cIf we get out of the lockdown measures as soon as you can justify it, and we invest into the right kind of sectors, I would not say this is a lost generation already,\u201d Stern said. \u201c[But] we need to get the response right.\u201d\nIt is still early to tell how many at-risk employees could ultimately lose their jobs, but Stern said it was not all doom and gloom for European firms and their workers. He said the outbreak will force some industries to manufacture new products or introduce new working practices that might otherwise have taken years to adopt.\nOne example is the German automotive sector, which was already shifting towards electric vehicle production. \u201cStimulus packages and the investments that come with it could foster and accelerate structural change,\u201d Stern said.\n\u201cIf governments decide that they want to invest into that sector by pushing electric vehicles then you see that will accelerate structural change in that industry.\u201d\nMeanwhile, customer demand will force more food, clothing and luxury retailers online, while more white-collar workers will be encouraged to work remotely.\n\u201cIf we get it right, there\u2019s an opportunity to address some of the inequality challenges, and there\u2019s also opportunity in addressing some of the economic structural challenges, we have ahead of us,\u201d Stern said.",

We have stopped a wave of devastation\u2019\nNew Zealanders will remain in total lockdown until 27 April prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said, with restrictions easing if elimination progress is maintained.\nSpeaking at the Beehive in Wellington, Ardern said New Zealand was in with a fighting chance of eliminating the disease, and the number of deaths was low enough that she still received a phone call for each one.\n\u201cWe have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation,\u201d Ardern said.\n\u201cOur transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people. We have amongst the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.\u201d\nThe prime minister said New Zealand had a \u201crelatively low proportion of serious cases\u201d, and according to the Oxford University coronavirus government response tracker, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\nOverall 1,400 people have become infected with coronavirus in New Zealand, and 12 people have died, all older people with pre-existing health conditions. On Monday, nine new cases were confirmed by the Ministry of Health, but random testing of 1,000 people in the community had returned no positive results.\n\u201cNearly every case identified since April 1 is as a result of overseas travel or contact with someone with the virus, often in existing clusters,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cOur testing has scaled up and we have now tested over 85,000 New Zealanders, one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world.\u201d\nThe director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said he was confident community transmission of the virus has not taken hold, but he, and other experts advising the government, had urged them to extend the level four lockdown, to be \u201cextra safe\u201d and solidify the gains already made in lowering infection rates.\nThe government\u2019s decision to conditionally ease restrictions from next Monday night has taken a middle path between those urging an immediate end to lockdown for the sake of the gasping economy, and those urging an extension to give the elimination strategy a fighting chance.\nMoving to level three overnight on Monday 27 April would see many more businesses able to trade, including those involved in takeaways and food deliveries, the construction sector and the forestry sector. The move to level three would have significant benefits for the economy, Ardern said.\nSocial lives would largely be unchanged however, with Kiwis still urged to remain at home unless taking exercise or fetching supplies. \u201cBubbles\u201d could be marginally expanded, however, to include close family or those who might be alone or isolated in the community, she said. Schools would be open, but students should remain at home, if they could.\nCabinet would make a decision whether level three lockdown would move to two on 11 May.\nNew Zealand entered lockdown on 25 March, when there were fewer than 150 cases of the virus and no deaths.\nLockdown has been widely complied with countrywide, despite stringent regulations, which have dictated Kiwis stay in their homes around the clock unless shopping for essentials such as food or medicine, or taking a brief respite of exercise within their neighbourhood.\nThe first two weeks of lockdown saw widespread confusion as to what and wasn\u2019t permitted, and the health minister David Clark was demoted after flouting the rules and taking his family to a beach 20km from their home.\nThere have been some isolated reports of lockdown parties, but overall police have praised Kiwis adherence to the rules.\nNew Zealand is pursuing an elimination strategy and is one of few worldwide to do so, but has advantages in being able to completely shut down its borders, having a small number of cases, and cities that are not so densely packed as the likes of New York and London.\nEpidemiologists working on New Zealand\u2019s Covid-15 strategy urged the prime minister to stay the course and choose the conservative path, saying if the country came out of lockdown too soon, months of good work would be lost.\nScientist Dr Michelle Dickinson, who participated in a press conference for children with the prime minister, praised the government\u2019s decision.\n\u201cWhile other countries show no sign of any control of Covid-19 I\u2019m so proud of NZ & what we\u2019ve done as a nation,\u201d Dickinson said on Twitter.\n\u201cWe had some of the toughest lockdown rules in the world, but today we can be optimistic about coming out of it on Monday & feeling safe that this is the right decision\u201d",

It will allow us to get back to work quicker. It will allow us to resume the economic activity of the nation quicker. And we need to do this for the country,\u201d he told the ABC on Monday.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people unemployed now and hurting. And the prime minister has made this clear \u2013 this is one of the key conditions we need to get economic life back into the country.\u201d\nBut the app has not been universally welcomed. Even government MPs such as the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce have ruled out downloading it because of privacy concerns.\nRobert has sought to address those by promising to release the app\u2019s source code, and insisting it will not track people\u2019s locations or be available to law enforcement.\n\u201cAll it will tell me is that you and I were in, for 15 minutes or more, 1.5 metres in proximity to each other,\u201d Robert said.\n\u201c[It] won\u2019t tell us where, because that\u2019s irrelevant, or what you\u2019re doing. We don\u2019t care where you are or what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nHe said people who downloaded the app would only be asked to add their name, age range, postcode and phone number. Using Bluetooth, the app would record when people were within 1.5m of another user for 15 minutes.\nThe data would remain \u201csecurely encrypted on your phone\u201d unless you tested positive for Covid-19, in which case it would be accessed by state health authorities.\n\u201cIf I was confirmed positive, my data goes up to a central data store, only to state health officials, no one else, and then they could rapidly call anyone I had been in close contact with,\u201d he said.\nBut data privacy experts remain unconvinced. Vanessa Teague, the chief executive of Thinking Cybersecurity and an adjunct professor at the Australian National University, said until the source code was released \u2013 and the government formally made it inaccessible to law enforcement \u2013 there would still be concerns.\n\u201cThe minister is saying it won\u2019t track your location and that the source code will be openly available, which are both good things that I\u2019m very strongly in favour of, but it\u2019s one thing to say \u2018we\u2019re going to give you that information\u2019 and it\u2019s another thing to give it to us.\u201d\nShe said the \u201ccentralised\u201d model proposed by the government, which would mean officials would de-encrypt contact information on the basis of a positive Covid-19 result, \u201cinevitably means the authorities are getting a complete list of your contacts\u201d.\n\u201cOne thing I really want to be clarified is, if we are using this trace model, how easy is it to omit certain contacts or turn off the logging feature if you choose to not relay the fact you\u2019ve been in contact with certain people?\n\u201cThe second is, how does that interact with other existing surveillance laws? So for example the laws used against a journalist recently means that under certain circumstances a police officer can demand access to your phone. If your phone has an in-built list of everyone you\u2019ve been near in the last two weeks, will that be excluded from our existing laws?\u201d\nExperts such as Teague argue the government should instead use a \u201cdecentralised\u201d version of the app, where instead of health authorities gaining access to a person\u2019s encrypted data if they test positive, the app notifies people automatically if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive. Similar apps based on this design are already being developed.\nOther experts have questioned how effective the app would be, and have said its use should not be tied to a rolling back of lockdown laws. Both Robert and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, have said they want 40% of the population to download the app to make it effective.\nHassan Asghar, a lecturer in computing at Macquarie University, said even if the government reached that target it was wrong to explicitly link the two things.\n\u201cThere is no guarantee it\u2019s going to be that effective in reducing the virus that the lockdown can end \u2013 countries like Singapore and South Korea have used similar technology and still have lockdown measures there,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a way to come out of lockdown, it\u2019s more like a support for whatever contact tracing processes they are already using.\u201d\nHe said a low uptake on the app would make its usefulness very limited.\n\u201cUsing a very simple scenario it\u2019s only going to be 100% useful if all my friends and family members and everyone I come in close contact with also install it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe more users you have, obviously the better your results. You could say OK, at least if one of my close contacts is using it that would make it faster for the authorities to be able to contact trace that person. You can say that\u2019s better than nothing. But it is also kind of tracing your movements so, you know, what\u2019s better?\u201d",

The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said transport authorities and operator Keolis were having to \u201cmake tough choices to reduce costs\u201d on Metrolink.\nHe added: \u201cWhile Metrolink has a proud history of operating without financial subsidy, the current crisis means that is no longer a viable or sustainable option. The government has already stepped in to bail out bus and train operators, so it is only right that a similar package is offered to light rail networks.\u201d\nJamie Driscoll, mayor of the North of Tyne combined authority, warned that the Tyne and Wear Metro needed emergency funding of \u00a310m by July. \u201cRidership is down 95%, and we are losing \u00a3900,000 a week compared to the normal baseline. It is the foundation of the urban economy and essential for key workers to get to work. If we can\u2019t operate our light rail systems, there is going to be no realistic prospect of an economic recovery.\n\u201cWe just want it to be treated the same as [national] rail and the bus system. Why is it that the publicly owned light rail systems are being left out?\u201d\nThe Midland Metro light rail service is losing around \u00a31m a month during the crisis. Laura Shoaf, managing director of Transport for West Midlands, which owns and operates the service, said: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to run a temporary network that is clean and safe and has enough capacity so people can be on it socially isolated \u2013 roughly 40 people on a [210-capacity] tram \u2013 and to make travel free where possible.\n\u201cWe want to do the right thing, but without any revenue all transport authorities are going to need assistance. Otherwise, we can\u2019t afford to run it and I would have to mothball the tram. It is taking a lot of key workers to hospitals and it would be a huge problem.\u201d\nSheffield\u2019s Supertram, operated by Stagecoach, could also be at risk without support.\nA Liverpool city region combined authority spokesperson said that it was \u201cin dialogue with the DfT about exploring potential support\u201d for the publicly owned and operated Merseyrail.\nRevenue losses at Transport for London, particularly on the Underground, have far outstripped that of other cities\u2019 public transport services, but TfL is understood to be more confident of securing additional funding. Simon Kilonback, chief finance officer, said TfL was \u201cfacing a substantial reduction in income\u201d from having cut passenger numbers to stop the spread of coronavirus but was \u201cworking closely with the government and is in constructive discussions over the support that can be made available\u201d.\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the challenges faced by light rail operators and continue to work closely with the sector and local authorities on the best solution for passengers.\u201d\nThe government suspended rail franchise agreements in March to avoid train companies collapsing, taking on revenue and cost risk and paying operators to continue running services.

Bodies were found at other locations and one police officer was also among the dead.\nOfficials said the gunman, named as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, died after shooting people in several locations across the province. By Sunday night, the death toll had risen to 16, plus the gunman, who died during a standoff with police. Authorities believe he may have targeted the first victims before going on to commit random attacks.\nAuthorities said Wortman was driving what appeared to be a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) car and was wearing a uniform but later reported he was at the wheel of a Chevrolet SUV that had been modified to resemble a police vehicle \u2013 \u201cone that he has basically made himself\u201d, said Brian Sauv\u00e9, president of the National Police Federation. Police have said the suspect was not an employee or officer with the RCMP.\nRCMP Commanding officer Lee Bergman said on Sunday evening: \u201cToday is a devastating day for Nova Scotia and it will remain etched in the minds of many for years to come.\u201d\nThe prime minister, Justin Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, deplored what he called \u201ca terrible situation\u201d.\nMass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, which has far tighter gun control laws than the United States.\nRCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said: \u201cWe believe it to be one person who is responsible for all the killings and that he alone moved across the northern part of the province and committed what appears to be several homicides.\u201d\nSauv\u00e9 said a police officer was among those killed in a shooting and another was injured. The dead officer has been identified as Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two who had served on the force for 23 years.\n\u201cHeidi answered the call of duty and lost her life while protecting those she served,\u201d Bergerman said on Sunday evening. \u201cTwo children have lost their mother, and a husband has lost his wife. Parents have lost their daughter and countless others lost an incredible friend and colleague,\u201d he said.\nThe massacre looked to be the worst of its kind since a gunman killed 15 women in Montreal in December 1989. A man driving a van deliberately ran over and killed 10 people in Toronto in April 2018 and a man shot dead six people at an Islamic cultural center in Quebec City in 2017.\nPolice have not provided a motive for the attack, which reportedly began in the small Atlantic coastal town of Portapique, about 130km north (80 miles) of Halifax, the provincial capital. Online records show Wortman ran a denture clinic in the city of Dartmouth, across the water from Halifax.\nPortapique residents said the first they heard about the incident was late on Saturday when police urged everyone to stay indoors.\nOfficers arrived at a house after receiving multiple emergency calls and found \u201cseveral casualties\u201d inside and outside the residence.\nOne local resident said she had come across two burning police vehicles while out driving on Sunday morning. One man said he saw at least three separate fires.\n\u201cThere was one officer we could see on scene and then all of a sudden, he went running toward one of the burning vehicles,\u201d Darcy Sack told the CBC. \u201cWe heard gunshots,\u201d she said, adding that one police officer looked to have been injured.\nAmong the dead was Heather O\u2019Brien, a nurse and grandmother from the town Truro in central Nova Scotia.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m outside of my own body,\u201d wrote her daughter, Darcy Dobson, who described texting her mother minutes before she died. \u201cI want everyone to remember how kind she was. How much she loved being a nurse. The way her eyes sparkled when she talked to her grandchildren and the way she just LOVED Christmas. Let those things define her. Not the horrible way she died.\u201d\nGreg and Jamie Blair, a husband and wife, were also among those killed. \u201cI have absolutely no words for the heartache my family & many others are going through,\u201d wrote Jessica MacBurnie on Facebook. The couple, married in 2014, leave behind their two children.\nLisa Mccully, a teacher and mother of two, was also killed during the rampage, according to a post on Facebook by her sister, Jenny Kierstead.\n\u201cI never imagined when I went to bed last night that I would wake up to the horrific news that an active shooter was on the loose in Nova Scotia,\u201d Stephen McNeil, the Nova Scotia premier, said on Sunday.\n\u201cThis is one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province\u2019s history,\u201d he added. He said it was an additional heavy burden amid efforts to contain the coronavirus.\nResident Jenny Kierstead wrote on Facebook that her sister Lisa McCully was among those killed. \u201cThis is so hard to write but many of you will want to know. Our hearts are broken today as we attempt to accept the loss of my sister, Lisa McCully, who was one of the victims of the mass shooting in Portapique last night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur condolences go out to the other family members who are affected by this tragedy. Thank you for your support, it\u2019s a hard day.\u201d\nTom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.\n\u201cThis is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,\u201d Taggart said by phone from his home in Bass River.\n51-year-old Gabriel Wortman is the suspect in our active shooter investigation in #Portapique. There are several victims. He is considered armed & dangerous. If you see him, call 911. DO NOT approach. He\u2019s described as a white man, bald, 6\u20192-6\u20193 with green eyes. pic.twitter.com/Y2nJNULlkn\nSunday\u2019s shooting also marks another grim milestone for the RCMP in the Maritime region. In August 2018, a man in the province of New Brunswick, which borders Nova Scotia, shot dead four people, including two police officers, in an apartment complex. In June 2014, in the same province, a man shot dead three police officers.",

Think of the Australian hunk and you probably think \u201cThor\u201d (possibly followed by \u201cPhwoar!\u201d). He has spent a good decade playing the Marvel god and little else (the less said about Men in Black: International the better). Without the cape and the hammer, will audiences stay interested? Or will they just think: \u201cWhy is Thor shooting everybody in the face now?\u201d\nThis is a test that many retired superheroes are facing post-Avengers. Film-makers, too. Extraction is very much a Marvel-alumni project. Its producers are Joe and Anthony Russo, directors of the last two Avengers movies (Joe adapted the screenplay, too). The director is Sam Hargrave, formerly a stunt coordinator on Marvel movies. The Russos already tested these waters last November with 21 Bridges, a police thriller starring Chadwick Boseman, AKA Black Panther. Boseman isn\u2019t quite so tethered to his alter ego as Hemsworth, and 21 Bridges was a decent movie, but it didn\u2019t find much of an audience in a box office crowded out by Oscar contenders and blockbusters.\nA more worrying indicator is the fate of Robert Downey Jr. Stepping out of his Iron Man suit after a decade, Downey went big. This year\u2019s Dolittle was a broad spectrum, bells-and-whistles extravaganza, and it bombed spectacularly. Was that down to Downey\u2019s diminished star power or his ropey Welsh accent? We\u2019ll never know, but it\u2019s sure looking cold out there.\nSome are taking a more cautious approach: Chris Evans was part of a large ensemble in Knives Out. Others have chosen to remain in the Marvel fold, hence Disney+\u2019s forthcoming series WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, and Hawkeye \u2013 all featuring the original actors from the movies. The only major figure to have bucked the trend seems to be Scarlett Johansson, who moved on from Avengers to two Oscar-nominated roles last year (Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit). Then again, she still has her solo Black Widow movie to come, so it\u2019s too soon to say whether she has really escaped the curse.\nAs for Hemsworth, he has another Thor movie in the pipeline: Love and Thunder, due 2022 (and co-starring his erstwhile co-Man in Black, Tessa Thompson). So whatever happens with Extraction, he should be all right. But many actors who assumed a superhero gig would be a springboard for their careers must be wondering if they\u2019re not more of a final destination.\nExtraction is available on Netflix from Friday 24 April",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, this is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia on Monday 20 April.\nAustralia has recorded its lowest daily increase in cases since early March.\nThree states \u2013 Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia \u2013 have recorded no new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours.\nVictoria recorded just one new case overnight, while New South Wales recorded six new cases, the lowest daily total in five weeks. The Australian Capital Territory recorded one new case.\nIt\u2019s the third day in a row that South Australia recorded no new cases. The state\u2019s chief public health officer, associate professor Nicola Spurrier, said that result came on the back of increased testing. Almost 5,000 people were tested over the past five days.\nBoth South Australia and Queensland said if results remained that strong, they would begin considering lifting restrictions.\nThe national total increased by just 26 cases. That seems to comprise mainly of 16 new cases among crew members aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which were not included in NSW\u2019s daily totals. A total of 202 crew members on the ship, which is moored at Port Kembla, have now tested positive to Covid-19.\nAccounting firm Deloitte is understood to have been appointed the administrators for Virgin Australia, which has collapsed despite competing offers of rescue packages from the Queensland and NSW state governments.\nIt comes after the Australian government refused the airline\u2019s request for a $1.4bn emergency loan. It\u2019s not clear what this development will mean for the airline\u2019s 10,000 staff or 130 planes.\nThe Australian government has announced it will impose a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies Facebook and Google that will force them to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies.\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said the code, which will include penalties and binding dispute resolution mechanisms, will \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d between media companies and the two tech giants.\nDigital experts have called on the federal government to formally make data collected by its coronavirus tracking app exempt from use by law enforcement.\nAnd the Law Council of Australia has said that the public health benefits of the app need to be balanced with the privacy implications.\nGovernment services minister Stuart Robert said on Monday that the information collected by the app, which is intended to register when people have been standing near another person for more than 15 minutes, can be used in contact tracing for a potential Covid-19 infection, will \u201callow us to get back to life quicker\u201d.\nTodd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL, has resigned his post effective immediately, in the latest blow to a league that has struggled financially since the shutdown of the 2020 season due to the coronavirus.\nIn a shock announcement on Monday, Greenberg said he and the league had come to a mutual agreement to part ways. Chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo will take over the role on an interim basis until a replacement CEO is found.\nGreenberg said it had been a \u201cgreat honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last four years\u201d.\nAustralia\u2019s unemployment rate could rise as high as 16% over the next few months due to the continued economic impact of the coronavirus, according to a report by the Grattan Institute.\nThe report said that between 17% and 28% of Australian workers, or 2.2 million to 3.6 million people, are either out of work now could be out of work in the coming weeks and months as a direct result of social distancing laws introduced in March. The jobseeker scheme will keep the official unemployment rate lower.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nRules preventing non-urgent elective surgery could be lifted within the month, the federal deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth said.\nThe issue was discussed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on Monday and will be considered at a national cabinet meeting on Tuesday.\n\u201cThere are Australians out there who are in pain and have disability, cannot be in the workforce, they need to take very potent pain medication and they need their elective surgery done,\u201d Coatsworth said.\nWhat you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?\nAm I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

        "content": "The routine for my cancer treatment was starting to feel almost relaxing. I shouldn\u2019t have got ahead of myself\nWhen someone near me coughs, my whole body tenses. The mouth sores that come with chemotherapy can irritate your throat, and the cough probably has nothing to do with coronavirus. But sometimes I can\u2019t help but hold my breath, suddenly terrified that the virus I\u2019ve been trying to protect myself from is mere feet from me.\nI\u2019m sitting in a chair in Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Washington, with chemotherapy drugs pumping through my bloodstream to treat my stage 2 cervical cancer. It\u2019s my third week of treatment and it feels more crowded than usual: I can see at least 10 other patients today, plus a few visitors and a handful of nurses.\nI\u2019m trying to convince myself to use the bathroom but I\u2019ve already been four times, and each time I have to wade through this terrifying maze of people.\nThe hospital now requires patients and visitors to wear masks. But rather than making me feel protected, the mask traps my breath, fogs up my glasses and makes me hot and claustrophobic.\nI\u2019ve been listening to my apocalypse playlist today. I made it a while back to store my favorite songs. There\u2019s some Tragically Hip, The Cure, Awolnation and of course Hamilton. It feels appropriate, but it\u2019s not doing much to curb my anxiety.\nI just hit the halfway point in my treatment, and I\u2019ve settled into a routine. After I got past the initial fear of chemo, the process was starting to feel fairly relaxing. I was able to get out of the house and have a few hours to myself.\nBut my doctor was delayed today, which gave me time to think about how alone I feel without my family by my side, and my nerve was irritated when a nurse used a needle to access my chemo port. I usually face a window, but this time my chair faced all those people in the room. Any semblance of calm I had at the beginning of the day was completely shot.\nI should have known better than to think that the difficult times were behind me. My doctors warned me that this is when the symptoms ramp up. I have to stop thinking that I\u2019m somehow invincible or the exception to the rules.\nOn Sunday evening, I felt a whole new level of stabbing and cramping pain as my stomach seemed to slowly drop out of my body. I yelled for my husband, who brought me anti-diarrhea medication and water. But after an hour, I started to wonder how I will know when the pain crosses from something I need to endure into more dangerous territory.\nMy days are becoming consumed with fatigue. When I get home from my daily radiation treatment, I fall into a deep sleep. On Saturday evening, I was supposed to have a virtual happy hour with my friends. I had my glass filled with Gatorade, but then I put my head on a pillow on my husband\u2019s lap. The next thing I knew an hour and a half had gone by and I\u2019d missed it.\nAnd yet, when I go to bed at night, I can\u2019t seem to stay asleep.\nI\u2019ve been putting radiation burn cream on my skin to prevent rashes, and so far it has been working. I also haven\u2019t gotten any mouth lesions from the treatment. Rinsing my mouth with salt, baking soda and warm water, followed by tea tree oil, five times a day is doing the trick.\nMy doctor tells me that I should soon expect to start passing some dead tumor. He described it as looking like bits of dark, dying cells. I told him that I have two kids, so nothing I see in the toilet will surprise me.\n---\nA few weeks ago, I started writing down everything me and my family are missing because of coronavirus and my cancer. I wanted to make sure we don\u2019t let the many trips we usually go on disappear without at least paying some sort of homage to them.\nI\u2019ve had to add James\u2019 graduation to the list. She has autism, and after 15 years of school, she is weeks away from completing all of the typical school grades and the district\u2019s transition program, which is basically life skills and job training. But now she and the rest of her peers won\u2019t be able to celebrate that accomplishment the way they should.\nMy husband and I haven\u2019t really talked with James about her thoughts on all of this. In some ways we all feel like it\u2019s another disappointment to add to the list. I hope one day soon that list will stop getting longer.",

Their enormous outdoor production at Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park in south London featured more than 100 performers, tanks and a puppet of a baby bigger than a double-decker bus. Now, as the baby turns one, they\u2019ve made the show available online.\nSoon-to-be-mum Zara (JoAnne Haines) has learning disabilities and the authorities don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of being a parent. Framed as a breaking news bulletin on the day of the birth, the drama is led by energetic presenter Sam Hill. With Haines elevated on a crane, negotiations with social services go awry and the night descends into a literal war zone: the army is deployed. Joyce Nga Yu Lee directs a fantastic spectacle with cannon-streamer baby poo and sirened cars wheeling about.\nNext to Zara is the heart of both show and conflict: the big-bellied baby. She\u2019s a beautiful bit of puppetry with enormous swinging arms and inquisitive eyes. Some of the puppeteers attach a ladder to her chest in order to pop a dummy in her mouth, while others control her pudgy hand to indignantly pluck it out.\nThe question swirling is how best to serve the baby\u2019s needs, but all the production\u2019s possible answers seem over-simplified. The enormity of the display doesn\u2019t give much opportunity for subtlety. Instead, the focus is on making the audience consider how it feels to be on the receiving end of mass lack of expectation and constant intervention.\nSome of the production values don\u2019t have the same impact through the screen \u2013 particularly the 3D projection mapping \u2013 but the multi-camera recording is otherwise adept at giving a vibrant sense of the experience. Zara successfully challenges assumptions, and boldly and creatively gives a voice to parents with learning disabilities.\nAvailable on YouTube until 11 May.",

        "content": "As the National Theatre streams its acclaimed staging of Shakespeare\u2019s comedy, its star recalls playing Malvolia and eliciting help from the audience\nWhat was your reaction when asked to play Malvolia?\n  I was offered Olivia but she wasn\u2019t on my list of must-play roles. Theatre is such a commitment I need to be really picky. It\u2019s a big deal, being out every night and away from family. The National came back with the idea of Malvolio and my interest was piqued. The director Simon Godwin and I read the play a lot together, just the two of us, and then with Ben Power, deputy artistic director at the NT, and then with a group of actors. But part of me was quite resistant. They said what about making the character Malvolia so you\u2019re playing a woman? We did more workshops. I was very nervous of making Malvolio a woman and therefore a lesbian, considering what happens to the character in the play, which is monstrous.\nHow did you balance the elements of comedy and cruelty?I wanted to find out more about the ridiculousness in Malvolia. Sometimes people develop coping strategies that make them foolish. Malvolia is a deeply wounded human being who becomes OCD and bullies the other people in the household in order to cope. She meets her match in Feste. I thought it was a brilliant idea to invite Doon Mackichan to play Feste and to make Fabian become Fabia. You\u2019ve then got two more women who are the authors of the cruelty against Malvolia, alongside Maria. I thought that was interesting \u2013 there is so much cruelty against women perpetrated by women themselves. The self-judgment of women is awful. We started exploring what it was about Feste that enabled her to be so calculatedly and comically cruel to Malvolia.\nAs Malvolia, you use precise hand gestures that tell us much about the characterIt\u2019s an outward expression of her need to create order out of chaos. Hand gestures are often so much about threat and control. I trained as a dancer and am interested in what the whole body does. The way we express ourselves goes right to the very tips of our fingers. There is a moment when Malvolia comes on and tells Olivia there is a boy at the door who won\u2019t go away. I started to use a repeated gesture of pushing him towards her. Then Phoebe Fox, as Olivia, says to tell him to go away and she repeats the gesture back. Malvolia gets rather confused about why Olivia is using that gesture so does it again. It became a beautiful moment.\nMalvolia\u2019s judgment of the other characters extends towards the audience. How was that idea developed?I was overwhelmed by the size of the Olivier theatre, particularly in the letter scene which could be seen as a monologue. But I don\u2019t think Shakespeare ever allows monologues to be internal. It\u2019s a process of working out what you think about something in the company of 1,000 or so people in the audience. Who those people are is up to the actor to decide. I felt that Malvolia had a lot of internal voices which were powerful and controlling. So the audience embodied those internal voices and during the letter scene she is engaging with them to help her work out what this all means. I was afraid of it but the stage is so well designed to hold all of those people that it became weirdly intimate. The audience\u2019s delight in the comic thrust of that scene encourages Malvolia. No internal voice stops her \u2013 there is no voice of reason.\nWhen I was reading the script I didn\u2019t know how to pronounce \u201cflough\u201d in the letter. I said it in different ways to Simon and he laughed. Later he said: let\u2019s keep that in \u2013 maybe Malvolia doesn\u2019t know how to say it? Then I thought suppose one of the internal voices can help her pronounce it. Each night I elicited someone from the audience to tell me how to say it, so they are effectively egging her on in her belief. When, at the end, she says she will be revenged on the whole pack of them it\u2019s Malvolia realising that no one was courageous enough to stop her and tell her she\u2019s being ridiculous.\nFor the NT Live filming, how do you modulate your usual stage performance?When we rehearsed for the NT Live version we did it without an audience and I fell apart \u2013 I couldn\u2019t remember the lines. Malvolia works when she is in relationship to the audience rather than many of the other characters. A large part of the stalls was filled with camera equipment and it becomes difficult to engage with a body of people. It\u2019s a bit like when I did Black Books, which was filmed in front of a live audience. It\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019re playing to that number of people in the room or in a quiet way to the camera. You find a balance between the magnitude and the intimacy.\nIn every Twelfth Night we await Malvolio\u2019s yellow stockings scene. Yours becomes a cabaret-style showstopperIt\u2019s such a hot moment in the play. At the time, a puritan coming on in yellow stockings would have been unbearably shocking. I thought in this hyperreal world, where she\u2019s a woman, what would be shocking about her wearing yellow tights? So we needed to push it to find ultimate embarrassment. And because I have teenagers I thought what would upset them most to see me doing? I said to the designer Soutra Gilmour that this moment reminded me of popping corn: you have a dry kernel and you cook it in the pan with butter and it pops. Soutra created this amazing costume \u2013 she wanted Malvolia\u2019s pierrot cape to look like a piece of popped corn. The composer Michael Bruce had written all this beautiful smooth jazz for the production \u2013 cool, melancholic, quite sexy. I told him we\u2019ll need something for Malvolia\u2019s number when she comes down the stairs in yellow stockings. I just meant a piece of music but Michael came in the next day and he\u2019d put a Shakespeare sonnet to music. In one evening! He said: \u201cYeah, and you\u2019re going to sing it!\u201d Well, it would have been rude not to!\nWhat other Shakespeare parts are on your to-do list?I always used to say I didn\u2019t want to play Lady Macbeth because I find it too frightening. She really faces the darkest part of herself. But I\u2019d love to give that a go. I don\u2019t want to be the go-to actor who plays traditionally male roles. But I do think Simon Godwin is on to something about the need to re-envision Shakespeare plays. You know how they did Frankenstein at the NT with two actors swapping roles? Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if you had male and female actors swapping Macbeth and Lady Macbeth?\nTwelfth Night streams on YouTube from 7pm on 23 April as part of National Theatre at Home.

Concerns have also been raised over gaps in the safety net, raising the risk of higher rates of business failures and unemployment across Britain.\nThe announcement comes on the day the government\u2019s job retention scheme opens to applications, with the system expected to face significant demand as employers submit claims to furlough millions of workers.\nThe centrepiece of the latest financial package announced by the chancellor is a \u00a3500m loan scheme called the Future Fund, which will provide UK-based companies with between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a35m from the government, with private investors at least matching the government commitment.\nDistributed through the British Business Bank, the loans will convert into shares in the companies receiving them if they are not repaid. The government plans to offer \u00a3250m until the end of September before reviewing the scheme.\nA further \u00a3750m of grants and loans will also be made available for UK companies involved in intensive research and development of new technologies, with funding channeled through Innovate UK, the government body for supporting business research projects.\nThe government said the innovation agency would \u201caccelerate\u201d up to \u00a3200m in payments to 2,500 existing customers, while \u00a3550m will also be made available to increase support to these firms.\nAbout 1,200 hi-tech firms in Britain not in receipt of Innovate UK funding will be offered \u00a3175,000.",

Thomas Markle, who lives in Mexico, had been expected to walk his daughter down the aisle in the ceremony at Windsor Palace, and was revealed by the Mail on Sunday to have helped stage paparazzi pictures of himself preparing for the wedding.\nIn one text, Harry attempted to rescue the situation before the wedding. \u201cTom, Harry again! Really need to speak to u. U do not need to apologize, we understand the circumstances but \u2018going public\u2019 will only make the situation worse. If u love Meg and want to make it right please call me as there are two other options which don\u2019t involve u having to speak to the media, who incidentally created this whole situation. So please call me so I can explain. Meg and I are not angry, we just need to speak to u. Thanks.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cOh any speaking to the press WILL backfire, trust me Tom. Only we can help u, as we have been trying from day 1.\u201d\nRather than reply to Harry\u2019s calls and messages, it is alleged that Thomas Markle instead gave a statement to the US celebrity website TMZ stating he had had a heart attack. Meghan learned about her father\u2019s hospitalisation, just days before her wedding, from the TMZ report.\nMeghan later messaged her father in hospital to offer her support. \u201cI\u2019ve been reaching out to you all weekend but you\u2019re not taking any of our calls or replying to any texts \u2026 Very concerned about your health and safety and have taken every measure to protect you but not sure what more we can do if you don\u2019t respond \u2026 Do you need help? Can we send the security team down again? I\u2019m very sorry to hear you\u2019re in the hospital but need you to please get in touch with us \u2026 What hospital are you at?\u201d\nAfter Markle refused the offer of security guards to protect him from press intrusion, the court documents say Meghan messaged him again. \u201cHarry and I made a decision earlier today and are dispatching the same security guys you turned away this weekend to be a presence on the ground to make sure you\u2019re safe \u2026 they will be there at your disposal as soon as you need them. Please please call as soon as you can .. all of this is incredibly concerning but your health is most important.\u201d\nIn the court filing, Meghan said the last contact she received from her father was a missed call at 4.57am on 19 May 2018, the morning of the wedding, and they had not been in contact since except through letter correspondence.\nThe Duchess of Sussex is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for alleged invasion of privacy, breach of copyright and misuse of personal data after it published excerpts from a letter she subsequently sent to her father complaining about his treatment of her.\nThe Mail on Sunday argues that as a member of the royal family she did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy and that there was no agreement with her father that the letter should remain private.\nIn her legal response, Meghan said the publisher of the Mail had sought to \u201cattack and intimidate her\u201d. She said she had no idea that five of her close friends had chosen to collectively cooperate with the US magazine People on a lengthy piece regarding her relationship with her father, which included references to the letter. The Mail on Sunday has previously suggested they were operating with the approval of Meghan, arguing that that meant her father had a legitimate right to reply to claims about the letter.\nMeghan\u2019s lawyers also suggest Thomas Markle claimed to have been hoodwinked into a nine-hour interview with a Mail on Sunday reporter in July 2018. Markle told his daughter in a letter: \u201cHe [the reporter] said a few things I said in confidence, but 85% were lies and bullshit! I called him and told him he was a thief, a liar and a coward and I would GET EVEN! ... I didn\u2019t want or intend to give him an interview and I certainly would not do nine hours for free!\u201d\nThe paperwork was submitted to the high court on Friday, shortly before the couple sent a letter to the editors of Britain\u2019s tabloid newspapers stating that they would now adopt a policy of \u201czero engagement\u201d with them. The pair quit their royal duties at the start of the month and recently moved to California, with Meghan voicing a Disney+ programme about elephants.\nPrince Harry is separately bringing a case against the parent companies of the Sun and the Mirror for alleged historical phone-hacking offences.\nThe hearing relating to the Mail on Sunday case will take place by video conference on Friday.",

        "content": "Pioneering immunologist who improved the lives of millions of hay fever sufferers by inventing the pollen count \nWhen Bill Frankland began practising in the 1940s, allergy medicine was barely a discipline. The allergist Adam Fox said: \u201cTo say Bill Frankland was the grandfather of allergy medicine doesn\u2019t do it justice. He wasn\u2019t the grandfather in the sense of being the oldest but in the sense of being the originator of the speciality. He did the original trials and founded the British society. He was still practising in his 90s and 100s, and remained the doctor people wanted to see.\u201d\nOn his release from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in 1945, Frankland, who has died aged 108, returned to St Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington, in London, where he had trained. He had suffered with hay fever since he was nine, and when he saw an advertisement for a part-time assistant in the allergy department, he applied. In February 1946 he became full-time and for the next 70 years was gripped by allergy medicine, which he said was like a fascinating detective story.\nFrankland worked at the allergy clinic at St Mary\u2019s hospital for more than 30 years, and was its director from 1958 until he retired in 1977. A few years later it was renamed the Frankland Allergy Clinic. It was the busiest in the country, and it is estimated that Frankland oversaw the desensitisation treatment of around 30,000 hay fever patients. At the same time, he also ran the hospital\u2019s pollen farm near Woking, Surrey, until it closed in 1970.\nIn 1948 the British Association of Allergists was formed with 30 members and Frankland as its secretary. It grew rapidly as it widened its scope to include immunology, becoming the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) in 1973. Frankland was its president from 1963 to 1966 and remained at its heart all his life.\nWhen he began his career in the late 1940s antihistamines had recently come on stream to treat allergies. Frankland was involved in several trials, demonstrating that two antihistamines reduced hay fever symptoms but were not effective for asthma.\nAllergen desensitisation for hay fever had been used since 1911, but had not been properly evaluated. Frankland had read about double-blind placebo-controlled trials and wanted to apply them to his discipline. Patients at that time were injected with a grass-pollen extract called Pollaccine to desensitise them.\nFrankland was concerned that it contained material that gave unwanted side-effects and wanted to determine exactly which part of the pollen extract was effective. In 1953 he recruited 200 hay fever patients and showed that a purified pollen protein worked just as well as Pollaccine. His paper, published in 1954, was a milestone: the first double-blind randomised clinical trial in immunotherapy; 65 years later, Frankland was gratified to see it celebrated on the 2018 cover of the journal Allergy.\nIn the 40s and 50s it was difficult for hay fever patients to control their symptoms without information on what type of pollen and how much of it was in the air. Frankland knew that atmospheric levels of pollen were being measured in Cardiff and wanted to do the same in London. In 1953 he installed a Hirst spore trap on the roof of the nurses\u2019 home at St Mary\u2019s and recruited a biologist (whose name he was amused to recount was Miss Hay) to provide daily pollen counts and analyse the prevalence of different pollens. Initially the information went out once a week to members of the British Association of Allergists, but, to disseminate it further, in 1963 Frankland persuaded the Times and the Daily Telegraph to print a daily pollen count. (It is now part of the weather forecast and coordinated by the Met Office.)\nAs well as his other duties at St Mary\u2019s, in the 40s Frankland spent two years as Sir Alexander Fleming\u2019s clinical assistant. He took care of Fleming\u2019s patients, reporting on their progress every morning at 10am even though Fleming preferred to discuss other subjects.\nFrankland said: \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t interested in clinical medicine \u2013 once he looked down a microscope, he continued looking down a microscope\u201d\nIn 1948 the publisher Butterworths asked for a new chapter on sensitivities in Fleming\u2019s bestseller Penicillin: Its Practical Application, and Fleming tasked Frankland with writing it. Fleming himself did not accept that people could be allergic to penicillin, saying adverse reactions must be the result of drug impurities. When he read Frankland\u2019s draft, he crossed out the last sentence: \u201cWith the increasing use of penicillin, it is to be expected that allergic reactions will become more common,\u201d substituting: \u201cWith the increasing use of penicillin, reactions due to impurities will become less common.\u201d Frankland disagreed, but did not feel he should argue with the Nobel prize winner.\nIn his long career Frankland treated many patients including, in 1979, Saddam Hussein, whose symptoms were caused by cigarettes rather than asthma. He told him: \u201cIf you\u2019re not eating, sleeping or praying, you\u2019re smoking. If you carry on, you won\u2019t be president in two years\u2019 time.\u201d Saddam heeded the advice and later flew Frankland out to Baghdad for a celebratory lunch.\nAs well as asthma and hay fever, Frankland was interested in many different allergies, and, in the now no longer permissible tradition of self-experimentation, in 1955 allowed the South American insect Rhodnius prolixus to bite him weekly so he could observe the reaction. He got the insect from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and kept it in the glove compartment of his car. After eight weeks, he had a severe anaphylactic reaction and was saved by two injections of adrenaline. Three hours later, he helped a nurse push her car. The strenuous exercise brought on anaphylaxis again, requiring a third shot of adrenaline. This experience led to his interest in the delay that is possible in allergic reactions.\nFrankland was born near Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. His father, Henry, was a vicar and his mother, Rose (nee West), a musician. He was an identical twin and nearly didn\u2019t survive because he was born prematurely and was tiny, weighing just over 3lb (1.4kg). The family moved to Cumberland (now Cumbria), in north-west England, and Frankland remembered getting postcards from his father who was away during the first world war.\nWhen he was nine he caught tuberculosis, and was unimpressed with the doctor treating him, deciding he could do a better job and should study medicine. He went to St Bees school in the county and then to Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, to study natural sciences. His studies were interrupted for six months when he returned home to care for his elder sister Ella, who had scarlet fever. She died in October 1933 and he returned to Oxford before moving to St Mary\u2019s hospital, qualifying as a doctor in 1938.\nTwo days before the second world war was declared in September 1939, Frankland volunteered as a civilian medical practitioner in the army. He was shipped out to Singapore, where his life was saved a second time. \u201cAnother doctor and I decided to spin a coin to determine our assignments,\u201d he said. \u201cI called heads and won. The man who lost went to [the] Alexandra hospital where he was brutally murdered by Japanese forces in 1942.\u201d\nFrankland, however, was captured and became a Japanese PoW. In 1943 he was moved to Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa Island), off Singapore\u2019s southern coast, where his two days of tropical medicine training were scant preparation for the array of malnutrition, malaria, dengue and beri-beri he faced. He was nearly bayoneted to death during a punishment \u201cbashing\u201d from Japanese soldiers, and his life was saved yet again when the Americans dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, ending the war and preventing mass shooting of PoWs.\nFrankland returned home in October of that year. He had married Pauline Jackson, an optometrist, in 1941, and had treasured her letters. When he arrived in Liverpool, he was asked if he wanted to see a psychiatrist and replied: \u201cNo. I want to see my wife.\u201d\nFrankland decided not to talk about his experiences to Pauline or to his family. He said: \u201cWhen I got back, I thought I\u2019m alive and this is marvellous. I\u2019m going to forget everything I\u2019ve gone through.\u201d When he was nearly 100, he told a colleague he watched a TV programme about VE Day and had his first flashback. Thereafter he was amenable to talking about his experiences.\nWhen Frankland left St Mary\u2019s in 1977, he became an honorary consultant at Guy\u2019s hospital in London, where he saw patients into his 90s. He also worked as an expert witness in court cases, and continued to write papers and attend conferences. Each year he presented the BSACI William Frankland award. He had a wide circle of friends and a great zest for life, remembered by one colleague as enjoying tea at the Ritz and riding a dodgem car aged 103.\nPauline died in 2002, and two years ago Frankland moved from his flat in Marylebone to accommodation in the Charterhouse, central London. When asked about his life, Frankland said: \u201cI have been very lucky.\u201d\nHe is survived by two sons and two daughters, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n Alfred William Frankland, immunologist, born 19 March 1912; died 2 April 2020",

        "content": "Chancellor cautions against lifting lockdown too quickly saying infections could spike\nSeveral European countries took preliminary steps on Monday towards a return to normal pre-virus life, with some shops reopening in Germany and a resumption of school for pupils slotted to take place next month.\nBookshops, florists, fashion stores, bike and car outlets and other shops smaller than 800 sq m were permitted to reopen on Monday morning. In Berlin a few schools allowed final-year students to sit exams. Pupils arrived wearing face-masks and took their seats at widely spaced desks.\nAngela Merkel, however, warned of a possible second wave of coronavirus infection if lockdown measures were abandoned too rapidly. The chancellor urged citizens to stay \u201cdetermined\u201d and said it would be a \u201ccrying shame\u201d if the country which has been praised for its deft handling of the crisis fell into a \u201crelapse\u201d.\nIn a video call with party colleagues Merkel said the \u201cdiscussion orgies\u201d taking place in some German federal states on relaxing curbs on were unhelpful. She said she was \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d the public might let its guard down.\nNonetheless, the clear trend across Europe is now towards some form of normalisation. Norway\u2019s government reopened nurseries on Monday after a month-long closure.\nIt said this was possible because children were less affected by Covid-19, adding that the virus was under control. \u201cGoing to pre-school is safe,\u201d Norway\u2019s education minister, Guri Melby, declared.\nSome parents, however, have criticised the move \u2013 a sentiment also seen in Denmark, where primary schools reopened last week. A Norwegian Facebook group called \u201cMy child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19\u201d has gathered nearly 30,000 signatures.\nPolls suggest around a quarter of Norwegian parents do not want to send their children back to pre-school.\nIn Poland parks and forests returned to normal on Monday, while in the Czech Republic open-air markets were allowed to resume as part of a six-week strategy to gradually lift restrictions. \u201cThis is relief from the stress that we will have to throw away the harvest,\u201d vegetable grower Milan Vystejn told Reuters, at his stand in Prague\u2019s Tylovo Square.\nAustria has already reopened some shops. It plans to reopen museums and libraries from mid-May. All three countries have seen significantly fewer coronavirus deaths than the worst affected countries in Europe: Italy, Spain, France and the UK.\nAll European leaders are battling with the same dilemma: how to prevent a renewed outbreak of the virus while at the same time maintaining public confidence, as poorer citizens run out of cash and national economies nosedive.\nThere are growing signs of unrest. Over the weekend police in Berlin struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning against the lockdown. Among them were anti-vaxxers, well known conspiracy theorists and right wing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship.\nIn France, meanwhile, there was unrest in the Paris suburb of Villeneuve-La-Garenne, after a motorcyclist collided with the open door of an unmarked police car during a pursuit. Skirmishes lasted into the early hours of Sunday and resumed again on Monday. Protesters burned cars and hurled fireworks at police, whom they accuse of heavy-handed behaviour. In the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, meanwhile, demonstrators protested against the local authorities and the country\u2019s continuing lockdown. Video posted to social media appeared to show protesters pelting the police with rocks, and police making several arrests.\nOn Monday France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said nurseries, primary and secondary schools would reopen on 11 May.\nPhilippe said the French government was considering options to implement the policy, including having half a class in rotation, or first opening schools in areas where there had been few or no Covid-19 cases. However, he warned the French not to plan too far ahead, saying weddings, parties, and travel outside of France were not immediately on the cards.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have answers today \u2026 given the barrier rules, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable that a marriage of say 200 people gathered in a confined place is to be envisaged. For how long I don\u2019t know,\u201d Philippe admitted.\nIn Spain, with nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths, the authorities have said they will hold off lifting restrictions. The rate of infection appears to be going down. The country reported 399 coronavirus deaths over the past 48 hours, lower than Sunday\u2019s figure of 410.\nSpain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is expected to ask parliament on Tuesday to extend a national lockdown until 11 May. He has proposed that from 27 April children under the age of 12 should be allowed out for exercise \u2013 but not teenagers.\nIn other developments:\nThe global number of deaths topped 165,000 with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University.\nAustralia reopened three of Sydney\u2019s beaches but only for exercise. \u201cActivities such as sitting on the sand, sun-baking or gathering in groups will not be permitted,\u201d said Danny Said, a local mayor.\nIndia allowed some industrial and agricultural work to resume, even as the country recorded its single biggest-day rise in coronavirus cases.\nIn Iran, where the outbreak has killed at least 5,000 people, some major shopping centres opened, including Tehran\u2019s historic grand bazaar. The move follows an easing of some social distancing rules last week. Working hours are restricted until 6pm.\nHong Kong recorded no new coronavirus cases on Monday for the first time since early March, health authorities said. The city has had 1,025 confirmed cases and four deaths since January when the pandemic began.\nGhana ended a three-week lockdown on two key regions including the capital, Accra, and Kumasi. In a televised address the president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said testing had improved, adding that quarantine restrictions were having a severe impact on the poor.",

The ministry did not indicate that any of the soldiers had been infected with the coronavirus.\nThe announcement came days after Vladimir Putin postponed celebrations for Victory Day on 9 May, a significant holiday in Russia usually marked by a military parade in Red Square and events where Russians pay respects to victims and veterans of the second world war.\nThe Kremlin had been hesitant to postpone the 75th anniversary celebrations, which Putin had hoped to use to strengthen ties with foreign leaders, in particular the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who was expected to attend.\nCases of coronavirus have been discovered in several Russian military units and academies. Last week, the defence ministry confirmed that dozens of cadets and instructors from the Nakhimov naval academy, which sends a delegation to march in the Victory Day parade, had been infected with coronavirus. The ministry said that none of those infected had taken part in the rehearsals.\nA leaked video earlier this month showed thousands of troops lined up at a parade ground outside of Moscow, prompting outrage and surprise, coming at the same time as the city and surrounding region instituted strict physical distancing guidelines.\n\u201cHow many people are there, 15,000? Fuck, and they\u2019ve said no more than 50 are supposed to gather in one place. Not one fucking mask,\u201d said one voice on the video, which was shot anonymously.\nThe defence ministry then confirmed it had held a parade rehearsal on 1 April. No photos or videos have been released from the parade grounds since then, although the defence ministry insisted it was continuing preparations for the parade as normal. Full dress rehearsals for the parade had been scheduled for 29 April and 4 May.\nAsked whether the rehearsals violated physical distancing guidelines, Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, told reporters that the military had \u201ca totally different regime of isolation that of course allows them greater freedom of movement\u201d.",

        "content": "The English Football League is considering a proposal to extend the summer transfer window until at least the end of January to alleviate financial pressures on its clubs amid the coronavirus crisis. Mark Catlin, the Portsmouth chief executive, has raised with Rick Parry, the EFL chairman, the prospect of relaxing the window to enable clubs to trade players to ease next season\u2019s cashflow and Catlin will push for the matter to be discussed at Tuesday\u2019s conference call between League One clubs.\nClubs in Leagues One and Two are expected to discuss, in separate calls, how to complete the season, with some more reluctant than others to finish the campaign, even though the EFL is committed to doing so if possible.\nThe majority of League One and League Two clubs are understood to be receptive to Catlin\u2019s proposal, and the matter has been raised with some Championship board members. The EFL has been open to suggestions from clubs to help tackle the crisis, particularly with the increasing inevitability of playing games behind closed doors, and Catlin believes it is a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for lower-league clubs not to close the summer transfer window as planned on 1 September.\nHe argues that the relaxation of the window could help clubs to raise crucial funds and ultimately prevent them from being financially hamstrung or going bust. Some clubs are expected to head into next season with streamlined squads as a result of the pandemic, with many likely to be under financial strain because of the absence of matchday income amid an air of resignation that crowds are unlikely to return before autumn. On Monday Cambridge United became the latest club to furlough playing staff, joining Sunderland, Shrewsbury and Crewe, among others.\nIf Championship clubs were to reject the transfer window proposal, there is a confidence that League One and League Two clubs could adopt the rules in isolation, though any proposal would require an EFL vote, as well as ratification by Uefa and Fifa.\nEFL clubs are hopeful of resuming training on 16 May with a view to matches starting on 6 June but there is a growing reluctance among some players over returning because of fears they could put their or others\u2019 health at risk. The EFL continues to follow government guidance and has consistently outlined player welfare as a priority. It would be in line to pay back around \u00a350m to broadcasters in the event its competitions were abandoned.\nThe league and Professional Footballers\u2019 Association held further talks over the weekend regarding player wages but one source warned the fallout was \u201cdeveloping into a war\u201d, with no collective solution found.",

But in Mexico, armed clashes between rival crime factions continued throughout March and early April, and 2,585 homicides were registered last month alone.\nAnd as the Mexican authorities concentrate resources on pandemic control, analysts fear that criminal groups will take advantage of the crisis to further shift power away from the state.\nSources close to Los Viagras, the group that recorded its hand-outs in the streets of Apatzing\u00e1n, said the group is asking local businesses for \u201ccontributions\u201d to finance its aid.\nJust 30km away, the lieutenant of a competing armed group said he had \u201cinstructed\u201d the municipal government to establish a food bank for his group to organise hand-outs.\nLast week, Alejandrina Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 a daughter of the jailed Sinaloa drug overlord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 posted a Facebook video in which she and several other women assembled \u201cChapo Packages\u201d of toilet paper, tinned foods, beans and rice.\n\u201cLaw enforcement assets in Mexico will focus on Covid-19-related lockdowns, and criminal groups are clearly using the economic downturn and lockdowns to build up political capital,\u201d said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nMexico\u2019s criminal groups persecute the communities they rule over, exerting a heavy toll on businesses and civilians at large through extortion, kidnapping, and violence. Yet at the same time they act as guardians and protectors.\nWhere the state fails to provide basic security to marginalised populations, criminal groups often step in as self-styled public defenders, drawing locals into their orbit.\nSuch local support can insulate against hostile incursions from state and criminal competitors. In a recent interview, the logic behind such behaviour was made clear by the head of the Cartel of the South, one of groups competing over the Sierra of the southern state of Guerrero, where the bulk of Mexico\u2019s heroin is produced.\n\u201cIf we protect [local populations], they\u2019ll protect us as well,\u201d he said.\nCivilians who live under the rule of criminal groups are well aware of the criminals\u2019 motivations. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like any of them are good people,\u201d said one local in Michoac\u00e1n, \u201cBut the truth is we can\u2019t expect much from anybody else. At least we know [the local armed group], so they are in some way the least bad solution.\u201d\nPoor populations are expected to be hit hardest by what the World Bank estimates to be a 6% economic downturn in 2020, driven by Covid19-related paralysis and historically low oil prices.\nBetween mid-March and early April alone, 346,000 formal jobs were were lost in Mexico, but more than half of the country\u2019s workforce is employed in the informal sector \u2013 which is likely to be hit even harder.\nSuch bleak economic realities will also threaten the anti-crime strategy of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president who came to power promising to tackle the socio-economic causes that generate young recruits for crime groups.\nThe looming downturn means his social programmes will face their greatest challenge even before they have been fully rolled out\n\u201cFrom the outset, these programs were missing something. The documents laying them out don\u2019t even mention crime, violence, and insecurity,\u201d said David Ram\u00edrez, security program coordinator at M\u00e9xico Eval\u00faa, a thinktank.\nAs Mexican authorities shift their focus towards public health, some crime groups could be tempted to launch new offensives in territorial disputes with rivals.\nIn the past month, deaths, disappearances and displacements were registered across the country, including in Tamaulipas (north), Michoac\u00e1n and Guanajuato (centre) and Guerrero (south).\nIn early April, the Jalisco Cartel New Generation \u2013 regarded as the country\u2019s new criminal powerhouse following the extradition of the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n to the US \u2013 reportedly stepped up its push into the heavily populated State of Mexico, which surrounds Mexico City.\nCovid-19\u2019s long-term impact on organised crime and communities in Mexico depends to a large degree on how long the pandemic lasts.\nAccording to a Mexican lawyer who has brokered arrangements between groups such as the Jalisco Cartel and state actors, criminal factions are also concerned by the economic fallout of the outbreak.\n\u201cEverybody out there is worried right now. Maritime shipping is down, and [crime groups] are having problems getting their hands on precursor drugs [for methamphetamine and fentanyl], and fewer commercial flights from Colombia means less cocaine is coming through,\u201d the lawyer said, adding that some crime groups have already stopped paying wages to their members\n\u201cFor now, the shock is temporary. But if they get squeezed for longer, many will turn to alternatives [such as] extortion and kidnapping.\u201d",

        "content": "Officer stabbed and murdered during a terrorist attack on parliament in March 2017\nThe Metropolitan police are facing legal action over the death of PC Keith Palmer, murdered during a terrorist attack on parliament.\nAn inquest in October 2018 concluded with the coroner, Mark Lucraft QC, ruling that the officer\u2019s death may have been prevented had armed officers been closer.\nPalmer was on duty on 22 March 2017 at the Palace of Westminster when Khalid Masood ran through a gate and stabbed him.\nPalmer, 48, was one of five people killed during the attack that lasted 82 seconds. Masood first ran over people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing the unarmed police officer to death. His rampage ended when he was shot dead by a police officer.\nDuring the inquest the exasperation from Palmer\u2019s widow, Michelle, and his family grew as failings emerged.\nIn a statement the Met said it had received a legal letter: \u201cThe Met has received a letter of claim in relation to the death of PC Palmer. Given the likelihood of further legal proceedings, we are not discussing any further details at this time.\u201d\nThe legal letter was first reported by the Daily Mirror.\nThe inquest\u2019s conclusion from the chief coroner, Mark Lucraft QC, placed blame on errors by the Met. In his ruling, he said: \u201cDue to shortcomings in the security system at New Palace Yard, including the supervision of those engaged in such duties, the armed officers were not aware of a requirement to remain in close proximity to the gates.\n\u201cHad they been stationed there it is possible that they may have been able to prevent PC Palmer suffering fatal injuries.\u201d\nAfter the inquest verdict the chasm between Palmer\u2019s grieving family and the Met became clear.\nPalmer\u2019s widow, Michelle, who has been left to raise their daughter, Amy, said: \u201cHow could Keith have been left alone, unarmed, guarding an open gate at one of the most iconic buildings in the world and one of the country\u2019s top terrorist targets? He was left at a vulnerable location, with no protection, to die. The fact there were no firearms officers there for nearly an hour is hard to believe.\n\u201cI truly believe that if they had been there he would still be here today and Amy wouldn\u2019t have lost her daddy.\u201d\nArmed officers had not been near the gates in the hour before the attack, and believed their orders were to patrol the grounds, when in fact they were to stay near the gates.\nSpeaking after the inquest verdict, assistant commissioner Neil Basu praised Palmer\u2019s heroism and accepted the coroner\u2019s findings: \u201cThe chief coroner has plainly carried out a rigorous and full enquiry and we unreservedly accept his conclusions.\n\u201cEven the possibility that the MPS lost the chance to prevent the murder of a brave and courageous officer is unacceptable. For the loss of that possibility to protect him from Khalid Masood, we are deeply sorry.\u201d",

General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.\nThe repression intensified under Castelo Branco\u2019s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.\nWhat happened during the dictatorship?\nSupporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d.\nIt also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay.\nBut the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.\nIt was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil\u2019s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.\nHow did it end?\nPolitical exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.\nBut the pro-democracy \u201cDiretas J\u00e1\u201d (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.\nCivilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.\nAt one point \u2013 snubbing social distancing rules for the umpteenth time since the coronavirus crisis began \u2013 Brazil\u2019s paratrooper-turned-president clambered onto a truck to address the hundreds-strong assembly.\n\u201cThe era of roguery is over. Now it\u2019s the people who are in power,\u201d Bolsonaro proclaimed outside the Brazilian army headquarters, coughing repeatedly as he spoke.\n\u201cEveryone in Brazil must understand that they must yield to the will of the Brazilian people.\u201d\nBolsonaro\u2019s outing \u2013 which some suspect was a deliberate provocation designed to distract from the rising Covid-19 death toll \u2013 sparked immediate censure.\nFormer president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who governed from 1995 until 2003, tweeted: \u201cDeplorable for the president to join anti-democratic protests. It\u2019s time to unite around the constitution against all threats to democracy.\u201d\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, president from 2003 to 2010, tweeted: \u201cThe same constitution that allows a president to be democratically elected also contains devices to stop them leading the country to the destruction of democracy and a genocide of the population.\u201d\nRodrigo Maia, the head of Brazil\u2019s lower house, said Brazil was in a dual fight against coronavirus \u201cand the virus of authoritarianism\u201d.\n\u201cIn total, 2,462 deaths have been recorded in Brazil. Preaching a democratic rupture in the face of these deaths represents an unforgivable cruelty to the families of victims,\u201d Maia tweeted. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to waste with coup-mongering bombast.\u201d\nEduardo Paes, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s former mayor, tweeted: \u201cThere have always been morons going around ranting against democracy \u2026 Generally they\u2019re minorities whose tickles you don\u2019t even feel.\u201d\n\u201c[But it\u2019s] something quite different when it\u2019s the president \u2013 a democratically elected one \u2013 joining this kind of movement. There\u2019s no way to remain quiet and not repudiate this,\u201d Paes added.\nThe O Globo broadsheet called Bolsonaro\u2019s speech a \u201cdangerous\u201d assault on the democratic rule of law.\nEven members of the military top brass were reportedly upset, with one senior official urging citizens to ignore Bolsonaro\u2019s actions. \u201cLet the president talk to the nutters on his lonesome,\u201d they told the news magazine Veja.\nOn Monday morning Bolsonaro denied he had been attacking Brazilian democracy but told reporters: \u201cI am actually the constitution\u201d.\nBolsonaro is a longstanding fan of the military men who ruled Brazil from 1964 until 1985, and autocrats including Chile\u2019s Augusto Pinochet.\nBolsonaro\u2019s reaction to Covid-19 \u2013 which he has downplayed as media \u201chysteria\u201d \u2013 has proved similarly controversial. Last week Bolsonaro sacked his popular health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had clashed with him for undermining health ministry recommendations designed to protect Brazilian lives.\nMandetta\u2019s replacement Nelson Teich made no immediate comment on Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to flout the same guidelines on Sunday.",

Ivanka helpfully supplied images of a goose, goat, greyhound and camel to get people started.How did it go down? Let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t meet with universal enthusiasm. Quite a few of the twitterati responded with a shadow puppet of a unicorn.How is that made? By putting your hand in front of the light, making a fist and raising your middle finger.I take it Bursill offers no illustration of the unicorn. None that I can see.\n   Any other responses? Mention of puppets put quite a few people in mind of the relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, with the former shown as a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy. Others said Ivanka should concentrate on the pandemic, with one person \u2013 in a nod to her fashion retailing background \u2013 suggesting she start producing designer body bags.A little over the top? It hasn\u2019t helped that she and her husband Jared Kushner, having told people to stay at home, defied the lockdown earlier this month to travel with their three children from Washington DC to celebrate Passover at her \u201cfamily home\u201d, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey \u2013 a round trip of more than 400 miles. Is Ivanka Jewish? She converted when she married Kushner in 2009.Creepy filial fact: Donald Trump once said that if Ivanka wasn\u2019t his daughter, he would be dating her. Ugh! Does Ivanka have a diplomatic role? You bet. She once attended President Trump\u2019s meeting with North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, in Korea\u2019s demilitarised zone in 2019, describing the experience as \u201csurreal\u201d. Truly a global player. Up to a point. She attracted international derision when the French government released a clip of her muscling in on a conversation between President Macron and other world leaders at the G20 summit in Osaka. It inspired a meme under the hashtag #unwantedivanka that showed her taking a prominent role in everything from the Last Supper to the Normandy landings. Not to be confused with: Ivana Trump, her Czech-born mother.Do say: \u201cIt\u2019s enough to give nepotism a bad name.\u201dDon\u2019t say: \u201cIvanka for president!\u201d",

Its components, including antibodies, are the raw material for the production of life-saving medications used every day in emergency rooms and hospitals to treat immune diseases, stop bleeding, and save babies born to Rh-negative mothers.\nConvalescent plasma therapy dates back more than a century and was used in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The treatment relies on the presence of antibodies that provide some level of immunity to patients who have recovered from the virus. The most effective transfusions contain high levels of antibodies that can, in principle, boost the recipient\u2019s immune defences for weeks.\nDoctors in China used convalescent plasma as an emergency therapy when the outbreak was raging on the mainland, and while early anecdotal evidence suggests it may have helped, formal clinical trials are needed to determine whether the intervention is really safe and effective, and that patients would not have recovered as well without it.\nIn the US, where the number of reported coronavirus cases is greater than in any other country, doctors have rapidly expanded a trial of convalescent plasma which has been given to hundreds of patients.\nNHSBT is seeking blood donations from patients aged 17 to 66 who recovered at least 28 days ago, the time it takes to be certain that persistent antibodies are in the bloodstream. Donations can be made at 23 centres across England.\nProf Sir Robert Lechler, the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences and executive director of King\u2019s Health Partners, which includes King\u2019s College London and three major London hospitals, is keen to trial the therapy and has been contacted directly by recovered patients who want to know how to donate their blood.\n\u201cConvalescent plasma transfusions are not a silver bullet solution for the coronavirus health crisis; however, they do have the potential to be hugely beneficial. The US has charged ahead with this. They have already treated 500 patients with convalescent plasma, and although it is much too soon to know the results, anecdotally it has helped patients recover.\u201d\nBeyond the therapeutic uses being looked at in the trials, if the transfusions are found to be safe and effective, and if the supply from donors allows, the plasma could also be used in care homes to prevent people who test positive from developing the most serious form of the disease, he said. \u201cThere is an urgent need for this kind of intervention. Let\u2019s hope we can start treating patients with this very, very soon.\u201d",

Usually he\u2019d go with a group, but because of social distancing orders, he ventured out alone.\nKane and other local residents volunteer to help restore coastal walls and fish ponds, or loko i\u02bba kuap\u0101, to reintroduce native seaweed and pua (baby fish) into the bay.\nResting against the slick black rocks, he looked north toward Sherwood Beach. Usually dotted with local residents, the beach was fuller than Kane expected.\n\u201cLocals are following the orders, staying home. But there are people, who are clearly tourists, here by the dozens,\u201d said Kane. \u201cThey\u2019re still out here, still in groups of seven or more, still coming, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nHundreds of travelers, motivated in part by $100 airfares, are still crossing the Pacific to ride out the pandemic in Hawaii. Last week alone, more than 800 non-residents flew there. Meanwhile, locals and some legislators are growing increasingly frustrated. They assume the statewide mandatory self-quarantine order \u2013 two weeks for out-of-state visitors and inter-island travelers \u2013 isn\u2019t being followed. They also anticipate that disregard by travelers will result in more Covid-positive cases in Hawaii, stressing an already ill-equipped healthcare system.\nHawaii just confirmed its 580th Covid-19 case and 10th death. To date, 35 non-residents have tested positive for Covid in Hawaii. On Saturday, Hawaii\u2019s governor, David Ige, closed all beaches, though water activities are still allowed.\nKane, 34, a Waim\u0101nalo neighborhood board member and community representative, has seen travelers at the grocery stores or gas stations in Kailua or Kaneohe, tourist hotspots and towns with high rates of coronavirus cases. He says he worries for his family and community, many of whom have underlying health conditions \u2013 Native Hawaiians and Micronesians suffer disproportionately from poor access to healthcare and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Almost all of Kane\u2019s family members are still reporting to food-service jobs around the island and several are pregnant.\n\u201cPeople will always see this place as their playground. And in this moment, as a Native Hawaiian, this is very reflective of many historical circumstances, where people from outside of the islands have come in and caused real harm to the native population. It\u2019s not always with direct intent to do so, but the impacts, especially on Hawaiian people, are very real,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you take our history, it tells us that we are not very well protected.\u201d\nOn Oahu and the outer islands, tensions are high. Protesters have shouted and taken pictures of incoming travelers who have their temperatures taken upon arrival and sign contracts agreeing to adhere to the quarantine order. Outside a Maui airport, some travelers raised their middle fingers as they passed by Bryan Berkowitz, a Maui resident.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond frustrating,\u201d said Josh Masslon, a Maui-based ICU nurse. \u201cWe cannot handle an outbreak with our resident population alone.\u201d\nMasslon added that he has called law enforcement several times when he has seen rental cars parked at beaches with groups of people on the sand.\nDebates on Facebook and Instagram between incoming travelers and islanders go on daily. Several travelers wrote \u201cSee you soon\u201d and \u201cWe only care about our opinions.\u201d In late March, one family of four from Illinois was assaulted and the tires on their rental car were slashed in Waikiki.\nOahu locals have been relishing the spectacle of an empty Waikiki. \u201cIt\u2019s our Times Square and it\u2019s silent,\u201d said Mollie Bruhl, a resident of Honolulu suburb Kalihi. She has been venturing to Waikiki to surf almost daily, which is still allowed, but beaches are being patrolled on foot and by drone by law enforcement. Every so often, a voice rings out from the drone: Aloha. The stay-at-home order is in effect. Please do not gather or sit on the beach. Water activities are permitted, but please leave immediately after.\nIn an effort to gauge intentions of non-locals, other residents who have been surfing in Waikiki said they have talked to travelers out on the water who claimed they were coming to the islands for an extended stay upon arriving at the airport.\n\u201cPeople from Hawaii have always had this underlying tension with people coming in,\u201d said Bruhl. \u201cPeople here see themselves as a collective considering the whole rather than \u2018I\u2019. Now we feel like we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves.\u201d\nOn 1 April, Governor Ige established a mandatory two-week self-quarantine for out-of-state visitors and inter-island travelers. Visitors must tell the state where they are staying and they cannot list vacation rentals as their lodging. Violators face fines or prison time; two individuals on Kauai have been arrested so far. The state also instituted a program that is financing return flights for travelers who arrive without accommodations.\nThe state is supposed to be following up with tourists on their whereabouts, but limited resources make it difficult to keep tabs on thousands of new arrivals. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re doing is notifying the hotels, and hotel staff check,\u201d the state adjutant general, Kenneth Hara, told a special legislative committee last week. I spoke with eight individuals who arrived in Hawaii from four US cities in the last week and none have received a follow-up call.\nThe mayors of Honolulu, Kauai and Maui county asked the White House to stop all non-essential travel to Hawaii. Governor Ige rebuked the request, saying it would be up to the airlines and they could not discriminate among essential and non-essential passengers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a situation where the majority of those who are ordered to quarantine are not obeying,\u201d Ige said. \u201cBut we are continuing to look at improving the system as we go.\u201d\nOther representatives have called for stricter responses, similar to that of New Zealand, while hundreds of residents signed a petition demanding shuttered hotels be used to isolate all travelers.\nKane has been volunteering with organizations and local chefs to help source and deliver products and meals to multi-family homes and the elderly in Waim\u0101nalo.\n\u201cThe state has failed to protect many, in the people\u2019s eyes, locally,\u201d said Kane. \u201cIt took too long to mandate closures, and the communities that would be hardest hit weren\u2019t taken into consideration.\u201d\nHe expects little change from the state as he looks ahead to when the islands open up again, and the number of non-residents arriving daily could surpass 30,000.\nEvery few days, he ventures back to the fish pond on Waim\u0101nalo Bay alone. There, he is reminded that change and survival is its own tradition among his communities. This moment in particular rings of how change can be total and inconclusive and instantaneous.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re living this one together, like always,\u201d he said.",

Our cherished concept of work is increasingly meaningless \u2013 the future belongs to those who understand the arts of life\nThe infantilising of the people by our leaders is horribly revealing of the English psyche. \u201cJam tomorrow and jam yesterday \u2013 but never jam today.\u201d Only it is not jam in this case, it is life-saving personal protective equipment. I specify \u201cEnglish\u201d because Nicola Sturgeon addresses her nation as grownups and Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel pay their people the same respect. Now, armed with the knowledge that our prime minister bunked off Cobra meetings as this crisis unfolded, we are being told nothing can really be decided until he comes back from his convalescence. So we are stuck with ministers in supply teacher mode.\nEverything has changed and we need to prepare for the new normal. Lockdown isn\u2019t ending any time soon. There is no simple choice between saving lives and saving the economy; the two are intertwined. There is no going back to BC: before corona. Some of us knew this from day one, others are still in denial. There is the unmistakable feeling that a monumental shift in how we live is coming, one way or another, a shift that has long been latent. Those of us in rich countries have been intent on pushing the climate emergency into the future, but now our money won\u2019t save us. Our vulnerability just might. But this requires humility. The idea that Boris Johnson will \u201cbounce back\u201d into his job is as ludicrous as thinking the economy will \u201cbounce back\u201d.\nMacron articulated this sense of shock last week when he said: \u201cThis is not a time for falling back on comfortable ideology. We need to get off the beaten track, reinvent ourselves, find new ways of living, not least of all me.\u201d\nSome of the new ways of living are starting to emerge, but there is a deep resistance to the fact that they may be permanent. Daily we see how Covid-19 has made visible existing inequalities of space, class, ethnicity and gender, but daily we see newer divisions, too. There is the divide between those who can work at home and those who can\u2019t, whether surgeons or hairdressers. There are those who find solace in their inner worlds and are able to treat this time as leisure, even on limited incomes, and those who are lonely and completely adrift.\nThere are signs of renewal or reinvention from many young people whose lives are on hold, but who are coping incredibly well in the circumstances, and from small and local businesses that have adapted very quickly where they can. But rigidity is found in nearly all big institutions \u2013 from government and the EU to big business and much of our cultural establishment. There is little agility here, just a hankering for the fantasy return to \u201cnormal\u201d.\nMany seem to hold on to a cherished concept of work that is increasingly meaningless. Some people are still working long hours while as a society we face mass unemployment. Whatever people are doing on Zoom all day, it seems they are still being productive, so surely they never need to go to an office again? A lot of pointless commuting can stop; people will have to admit they mostly go to work to escape home. There is nothing wrong with this, but reinventing ourselves requires a degree of honesty.\nIndeed, one of the hardest things about this crisis is that we all have to live with the choices we have made, whether we are on our own or with partners, with or without children. The everyday \u2013 untempered by other distractions \u2013 is the atomised existential crisis. Is this my life? What happened?\nIf we work less, we consume less, and we have long known that this is what we need to do to avert the climate crisis. Do we need all this stuff? Clothes and shoes? Do we need people to tell us next season\u2019s colour? Do we need tantrum-y chefs on our TV screens? Do we need endless lifestyle tips from celebrities? Well, no.\nWe need smaller supply chains when it comes to our farming. We need contact with other people. Better tech. We need to disband the nuclear family, which appears no longer fit for purpose.\nWe have long been warned that almost half of us would lose our jobs because of the rise of AI; for a very different reason, this future has arrived. This will clearly be hard. The pandemic kills some people fast, but it will kill others slowly, through poverty.\nIn 1930, as the Great Depression got underway, John Maynard Keynes wrote in his lovely essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, about \u201cthe painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another\u201d. I look to culture to guide us, but see only a rush to stream everything amid mourning for the loss of live performance. This is the same paralysis that has been evident in the arts establishment over the past few years, during which the only thing they had to tell us was that Brexit was bad. Innovative thinking is now as hard to come by as yeast.\nMaybe it is too soon to consider all this. The justified criticism of our government does not alter the fact we are a one-party state for the foreseeable future, so our social rebirth must come from below. It will not be top down.\nWe can breathe the cleaner air while we miss the pub garden and we can take stock. Keynes wondered about the challenge of spare time. \u201cMeanwhile, there will be no harm in making mild preparations for our destiny, in encouraging, and experimenting in, the arts of life as well as the activities of purpose.\u201d\nThe past has been full of purpose and activity and busyness. Much of it is now redundant. The future belongs to those who understand the arts of life. It is a big ask, this \u2013 to reinvent the wheel \u2013 but that time has arrived.\nSuzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

        "content": "Joe Cole has suggested Fabio Capello was not fully committed to his role as England manager and criticised the Italian for referring to David James as \u201cCalamity\u201d.\nIn an interview with the Guardian this month, Capello said England had \u201cplayed without conviction\u201d during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as they were eliminated by Germany in the last 16. But Cole, who came on as a substitute in the 4-1 defeat against Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side in Bloemfontein, has questioned whether Capello fully embraced his role in the same way as the incumbent England manager, Gareth Southgate.\n\u201cYou have to say he is a legendary manager, what he\u2019s achieved is unbelievable,\u201d Cole told the Daily Mail. \u201cI think it was never a marriage that worked in the sense that, I don\u2019t feel like he committed fully to the England national team.\n\u201cI do think he was a great, great manager... [but] you need to be across the whole [thing] \u2026 like Gareth [Southgate] is doing. He is really showing the way in terms of what is required in that situation and I felt Fabio, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t commit fully to the task. But I say that respectfully because, working with him, I could see he had that quality. The things he\u2019d do, the things he\u2019d say, he had something. I just think it was always tinged.\u201d\nCole\u2019s appearance against Germany was the last of his 56 caps, while James was also never selected again for England. Capello claimed the former Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Portsmouth goalkeeper was brought in to replace Rob Green after his mistake against USA instead of a young Joe Hart \u201cbecause of the players\u2019 trust\u201d and said: \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything. Everyone makes mistakes. He made one, so I changed. I put in Calamity James.\u201d\nBut Cole remembered it differently. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider myself in the bracket of senior players who maybe had the manager\u2019s ear with things like that. But I just think that\u2019s disrespectful to Jamo to say that.\n\u201cYou can have a valid footballing reason for talking about someone, if you can back it up. For instance, when I talk about Fabio I think of a legend, a great manager, I just think: was he fully committed to the England national team during that spell?\u2019\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t good enough. I don\u2019t want to make excuses. That Germany team went on to win the World Cup. And we weren\u2019t good enough at the time \u2013 we had injuries, you can\u2019t point fingers just at the manager, as footballers we just weren\u2019t good enough to do it.\u201d",

        "content": "A manic pre-summer caper skirts near dark territory but remains a mostly kid-friendly tale of an unusual family\nA year after Sony\u2019s wonderfully inventive Into the Spider-Verse became the first non-Pixar/Disney/Dreamworks film to win the best animated feature Oscar since 2011, the race was again populated by outliers. Frozen 2 was snubbed and instead Laika crept back into the spotlight with Missing Link (after winning the Golden Globe) and Netflix snuck in with two originals \u2013 Klaus and I Lost My Body \u2013 marking the streamer\u2019s first time breaking into the pack. While Toy Story 4 might have ultimately won out, the lineup continued to reflect both a widening field and an embrace of more left-field choices, a much-needed jolt of energy in what used to be a two-horse race.\nTheir latest animated offering, pre-summer caper The Willoughbys, is not exactly Oscarbait but it\u2019s further proof that Netflix is making a hefty investment in its animated content with a film as robustly made as any studio-funded theatrical release. It\u2019s a mixed bag of tricks but there\u2019s enough energy and left-field imagination here to make it a not completely fruitless option for parents forced to rewatch it on a loop over the coming weeks. Like reigning lockdown family favourite Trolls: World Tour, it\u2019s a story told at high speed, an adventure that recalls everything from The Addams Family to Home Alone to A Series of Unfortunate Events to The Royal Tenenbaums, skating past so many familiar touch points while struggling to fully develop its own identity.\nThroughout history, the Willoughby name has been attached to heroic, intelligent, groundbreaking figures, a tradition that has come to an abrupt end with the latest descendent: a selfish, stupid man and his equally wretched wife. Despite hating children, they end up producing four of them who grow up with a constant reminder of how unwanted and unloved they are. Through an unusual set of circumstances involving an abandoned baby and a candy factory, the kids concoct a plan: they will orphan themselves in order to find a better life.\nIt\u2019s a dark conceit for a film aimed at a young audience, shown off in one of the film\u2019s funniest sequences that montages a variety of different death scenarios for their awful parents. Narrated by a cat voiced by Ricky Gervais, there\u2019s a Lemony Snicket-esque \u201cthis isn\u2019t your average kids movie\u201d tone to The Willoughbys as we\u2019re informed early on that this won\u2019t have a happy ending. It\u2019s not exactly true but in one particular respect, that I won\u2019t spoil, the film does have the courage of its early convictions, denying us a buoyant reversal we\u2019re fully expecting.\nI wondered at times what could have been if the film had been aimed at younger teens rather than children and leaned further into the darkness because instead The Willoughbys offsets its gothicism with bright colours and slapstick humour, speeding along at such a manic pace that it\u2019s often hard to keep up with. The frantic plot is a little too frantic at times, adding so much that it starts to take away from the intriguing set up. The film\u2019s busyness also starts to muddy its emotional core, which hampers what\u2019s framed as a heart-tugger of an ending.\nBut the director, Kris Pearn, whose last film was the similarly overstuffed sequel to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, keeps things visually inventive until the end, packing his short film with almost enough imaginative imagery to distinguish it from its many peers. While there\u2019s an odd disparity in age between the voices behind the lead siblings (49-year-old Will Forte playing the older kid brother to 23-year-old Alessia Cara), the cast, including Martin Short, Maya Rudolph, Terry Crews and Jane Krakowski, spark off each other well, the choice to use established comic actors adding much-needed humour to a script that sorely needs it.\nWhile The Willoughbys might not boast the slick structure or beating heart of a Pixar animation, there\u2019s enough offbeat charm to make it an easily digestible watch and for any concerned parents, the practice of \u201corphaning\u201d involves so much work, your kids will likely be scared off \u2026\nThe Willoughbys is available on Netflix from 22 April",

        "content": "Education workers say enforcing social distancing among primary pupils is \u2018almost impossible\u2019\nA letter from an NHS nurse urging the government to keep schools closed because of the health risks to staff and the wider community has attracted more than 7,000 signatures, as teachers described trying to maintain social distancing in primary classrooms as \u201calmost impossible\u201d.\nIain Wilson, an NHS nurse with two children at school in Lewisham in south London, who has experience of working with Covid patients, wrote to ministers: \u201cDo not make us the global guinea pigs. It is self-evidently unwise to force hundreds of people into small rooms in small buildings during a pandemic.\n\u201cSome teachers have already tragically died from the virus, and we do not want to risk any more,\u201d wrote Wilson, a member of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, in an open letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock.\nOn Monday, as the summer term began with millions of children in lockdown, one headteacher described the challenge of trying to keep the small number of pupils currently in the emergency schools, which are open to vulnerable children and those of key workers, at a safe distance from each other.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible,\u201d said Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which runs nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 56 children in one primary school this morning and the school is full because we\u2019re using social distancing to keep them apart. Every time they move from a table, somebody comes and wipes it. Every time they use a badminton racquet, someone wipes the handle. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\nPupils \u201creturning\u201d to school at home accessed more than a quarter of million lessons provided by the government\u2019s new virtual academy, the Oak National Academy, which opened on Monday.\nCreated by more than 40 primary and secondary school teachers to keep children learning during the coronavirus lockdown, Oak aims to provide more than 180 lessons a week, with video tutorials and resources for teachers to support online learning already being provided by schools.\nOn its inaugural day, 140,000 students took part in an English lesson and almost 120,000 did maths, while the most popular single session was counting up to 10 for reception pupils, followed by reading comprehension for seven- and eight-year-olds. Poetry comprehension and Henry VIII were also popular.\nOn Sunday the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, moved to quell continuing speculation about schools reopening to all pupils, insisting that ministers would not contemplate it until the government\u2019s five tests for beating the pandemic are met, but headteachers and local authorities are worried about the continuing uncertainty.\nThe tests are: protecting the NHS\u2019s ability to cope; a fall in daily death rates; reliable data showing decreasing infection rates; confidence in testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) capacity; and confidence that changes to the government\u2019s approach won\u2019t risk a second peak of infections.\nMany in the sector remain concerned, however, about not just when but how a return to school will be effected, and there are fears that the longer schools remain closed, the greater the loss of learning, particularly for more disadvantaged pupils who may struggle to engage with online lessons.\n\u201cSchools are working hard to deliver the best learning possible to pupils at home,\u201d said Jules White, the headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham, West Sussex. \u201cThe reality is, however, that self teaching is very hard even when there is strong family support.\n\u201cWhilst many issues need to be resolved for schools to open more fully, we must begin to think about further prioritising children who struggle most with learning and/or come from disadvantaged circumstances. When it\u2019s safe they must get back into schools in larger numbers than we are seeing at present.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s letter warned: \u201cUntil we know that children will not learn that their teacher has died because of an infection caught in their class, we should remain sensible and wait.\n\u201cThe economic harm of keeping schools closed is significant \u2013 but is known. This means the government can act and intervene to mitigate this harm. We do not know about the harms of reopening schools yet.\u201d",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nHorovitz and Diamond amble on stage, apparently dressed head-to-toe in Gap, and appear for all the world to be about to unveil the iPhone 4S, although actually their jokey anecdotalism makes the show in some ways like the regional tours once presented by George Best and Rodney Marsh. With amiably rehearsed back-and-forth banter, they introduce the embarrassing photos and excruciating TV clips that are shown on a big screen. And the effect of seeing them juxtaposed with the plump-faced frizzy-haired imps of 1986 is startling and bizarre. In the present day, the advancing years seem to have boiled away the badass attitude, leaving behind the quirky humour.\nThey started out in their teens as post-punk enthusiasts for the Clash, and the photos of them at this stage are starkly black-and-white. But then the archive images turn into the garish colour of MTV. The Beastie Boys got very excited by rap, were picked up for management by the (now notorious) Russell Simmons, brother of Run DMC\u2019s Reverend Run, and soon they were opening for Madonna. In 1986, their album Licensed to Ill happened, along with its fascinating and deplorable and horribly brilliant single (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!) \u2013 an anthem for blearily defiant Reagan-years hedonism. I remember hearing it around the time I read PJ O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Republican Party Reptile.\nThe Beastie Boys sold truckloads of records all over the world, and their puppyishly zany image co-existed with limitlessly energetic anarchy. They were, as they fondly recall, expected to be very dangerous on their foreign tours: particularly the British tour. Surreally, a full page of the Sun is flashed up on stage, and the band appear next to a giant picture of former Tory education secretary Kenneth Baker.\nThe band\u2019s live show featured a giant penis emerging from a box. Horovitz and Diamond explain they were intending to satirise the frat-boy image and it took over \u2013 though they have the grace to say that they didn\u2019t really care at the time about an alleged misunderstanding that was making them globally famous and rich. However, they also appear genuinely mortified at the fact that, in the early days, they fired the only woman in their original lineup: Kate Schellenbach (now the TV producer of The Late Late Show with James Corden). They repudiate their early reputation for sexism, but nobody in the film mentions these lyrics from the early single Paul Revere: \u201cI did it like this / I did it like that / I did it with a whiffle ball bat.\u201d\nInevitably, the Beasties spiralled financially over the top, relocating to LA where they rented a gigantic house featuring a swimming pool with a bridge over it, and went broke. Their accountant phoned to announce this event and heartlessly signed off with: \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go; I\u2019ve got Donny Osmond on the other line.\u201d A relocation back to New York, a chastened existence playing smaller clubs, and continued musical experimentation proved to be their path back up to the big league, and Yauch became a campaigner for Tibet. This film is a time capsule of the 1980s: an era that was crass and excessive in so many ways, but now seems weirdly exotic.\nBeastie Boys Story is available on Apple TV+ from 24 April.",

His impeccable logic is too important to be tucked away where relatively few will read it.\nTo summarise, any change in the infection rate of the virus is magnified greatly in the numbers infected. Thus every change for the better, such as people wearing masks, really matters. It matters little if all masks are not the best, or all wearers not skilled, because these are just minor percentages; the main thing is to block as much virus as we can. Whether an individual wearer is fully protected is beside the point.\nI would like to see the presenters at every coronavirus briefing walk in with masks on. The first speaker removes the mask, explains why they can (the empty room), and says their bit. Exeunt wearing masks.\nPerhaps lockdowns in defined non-hotspots can be lifted earlier on condition that masks be worn, and offenders be refused entry. Perhaps shops can offer free upgrades where the spirit is willing but the mask is weak.

The procedure for hospital admission could not have contrasted more starkly with that for our prime minister. My relative\u2019s daughter had to spend long periods of time calling back NHS 111, repeating her story, and ultimately pleading for an ambulance to be sent. There was, as your article reveals (Fears that people self-isolating with Covid-19 may seek help too late, 6 April), no follow-up.\nIt is fortunate that someone in their community loaned them an oxygen saturation meter. His readings were dangerously low, and at that point they were confident to ring 111 for a fourth time in 48 hours and plead his case yet again. He was finally retrieved, given life-saving oxygen and admitted straight away to a hospital.\nI can see the sense in not having patients queueing on trolleys waiting for treatment, as we witnessed in Italy. While our own homes may be better places to wait, relatives are not experienced in caring for loved ones with this severity of illness. In any other time, with any other condition, my relative would have been blue-lighted to hospital at least 48 hours earlier.\nIn my professional opinion NHS 111 is overstretched. There is no proper follow-up or registration procedure, rendering the hard work of those running the service not fit for purpose. And how have we reached this point? By not testing, testing, testing.Name and address supplied\n Following the laudable efforts in creating the Nightingale hospital in London, is it time now to refer all Covid-19 cases there, thus allowing Royal Brompton hospital and other specialist centres to return to caring for their regular patients, before their health is affected adversely? It would also ensure there are no cross-infection issues in hospitals attempting to treat both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients.\nIt is particularly galling for cystic fibrosis and heart patients to see NHS England in effect requisitioning the Brompton hospital for coronavirus use, having attempted to close this centre of excellence not once but twice. Patients now feel cast aside to fend for themselves. It is imperative that those who attend specialist centres for underlying health conditions do not become collateral damage in this crisis.Alison StannardUpminster, London",

The article draws attention to what data, if any, will be published. Although important, if this is the only focus of the inquiry, it will distract attention from the real issues.\nWhile we have been alarmed by the emerging picture, we have not been surprised. We published an analysis shortly after the start of lockdown, which noted that while the majority of BAME communities were comparatively younger, the impact of discrimination (higher rates of poverty, overcrowding and poorer access to healthcare) increased the risk of the impact of Covid-19. We also highlighted the higher risk faced by healthcare workers from these communities. But what has been shocking \u2013 and should be the focus of any inquiry \u2013 is the lack of action to address the greater risks identified by us and others.\nThe limited focus of the inquiry, combined with news that it is to be conducted by the very organisations that should have been leading action to address disproportionality, does not fill us with confidence. We fear this will end up being an exercise in obfuscation rather than action.Jabeer ButtChief executive, Race Equality Foundation\n As a GP working in a large BAME community, I am concerned by the unsupported assumption that low levels of vitamin D in BAME communities is contributing to the disproportionately high numbers affected by Covid-19.\nDr Colin Bannon\u2019s letter (15 April) fails to cite a single source of evidence. I\u2019m in support of encouraging all communities to take vitamin D supplements when needed, but without measured vitamin D levels in those admitted to hospital with Covid-19, his assumption is misleading. Without evidential support, Dr Bannon\u2019s conjecture distracts from the overriding issue of health inequality, a topic that many politicians and health authorities would rather not address.\nIn the light of this pandemic, health inequality needs to be investigated. Public Health England must release data on ethnicity and Covid-19 infection rates immediately. The proposed review is only beneficial if the government instructs the National Institute for Health Research, which funds research into healthcare matters, to make an urgent call for research into why BAME groups are disproportionately affected.Dr Grace OkoliGP, Lambeth; clinical lecturer at Barts and The London medical school\n The tragic deaths of BAME NHS staff cannot go on unchecked. As a second-generation BAME consultant, I know only too well of my genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease. I rarely find any BAME doctor of my age or older who is not being treated for high blood pressure. But that\u2019s not all. Some years ago, I found myself on the point of virtual collapse and diagnosed with a severe vitamin D deficiency. This vitamin is key to the body\u2019s immunity, including to chest infections, and is also likely to be lower in BAME populations.\nWith the combination of a Covid-exposed environment, compounded by high levels of stress and long working hours, it is not surprising that Covid-19 has taken its toll on BAME doctors. Apart from looking after our own health, we also need to be aware that Covid-19 infection is less likely to be mild than in other ethnicities. It is a salutary tale that may call for extra vigilance.Dr Tony RaoBeckenham, Kent\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u00a0a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nPeter Beaumont,\u00a0Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\nIn an email to staff last week, Prof Alice Gast, the college president, said she was taking a voluntary 20% pay cut as she announced a raft of cost-cutting measures, including the suspension of capital projects, a freeze on recruitment and plans to furlough staff members.\nImperial is one one of the jewels in the crown of the UK\u2019s higher education sector. Prof Neil Ferguson, of its faculty of medicine and school of public health, is one of the epidemiologists advising the government on Covid-19, and his team provided the modelling that led to the lockdown.\nIt is not, however, immune to the effects of the pandemic. Analysis suggests UK universities are likely to be one of the hardest hit sectors, with fears that international students will not return and the possible loss of tens of thousands of Chinese students next year resulting in gaping holes in budgets.\nGast told staff she was proud of the significant impact of Imperial\u2019s research, clinical care and public outreach on the pandemic, but warned: \u201cThe immediate need, as we face threats to enrolments and the financial burden of the shutdown, is to look for ways to conserve cash in the coming year.\n\u201cWe have already taken important decisions to suspend starting or approving new capital projects, limiting ongoing staff recruitment and identifying roles eligible for the furloughing scheme \u2026 We need to consider further measures.\u201d\nGast said Imperial\u2019s provost, Prof Ian Walmsley, would also be taking a 20% pay cut and that the board had volunteered for a pay reduction of 10% over the next six months. \u201cOur intention is to share some of the many sacrifices our community is making by volunteering, working on the front line or having their laboratory or workplace closed. This money will be used to help our students and staff in hardship.\u201d\nImperial is the latest of a number of higher education institutions to announce cuts or restructuring. Last week the University and College Union (UCU) condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the pandemic.\nEarlier this month it emerged that hundreds of university staff on precarious contracts had been dismissed in an effort to cut costs. Staff on fixed-term contracts, including visiting lecturers, researchers and student support workers, at Bristol, Newcastle and Sussex universities were made redundant or told their employment would or may end prematurely.\nImperial has benefited from large numbers of international students in recent years, with 64% of the student body coming from outside the UK in 2017/18, of which Chinese students were the biggest non-UK nationality.\nThe UCU\u2019s general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cIt is extremely concerning that any universities are using the current pandemic to look at changes to jobs and staffing levels. Staff are working extremely hard in difficult circumstances and university job losses will be disastrous for the individuals concerned and their families, as well as for the future of higher education.\u201d",

The upheaval was met with disbelief among many Kosovans, who wanted the government to focus on fighting coronavirus.\nKurti acknowledged the crisis had a local dimension, but accused Richard Grenell, who has been working on a potential deal for Serbia to recognise Kosovo, of being \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in pushing for the vote.\n\u201cMy government was not overthrown for anything else but simply because Ambassador Grenell was in a hurry to sign an agreement with Serbia,\u201d said Kurti in a press conference held via video link from Pristina.\nA Trump loyalist, Grenell is the US ambassador to Germany and was also recently appointed as the acting director for national intelligence, coordinating the work of 17 US intelligence agencies. He previously caused controversy in Berlin by saying he wanted to \u201cempower\u201d rightwing forces in Europe.\n\u201cWhat he [Grenell] needs is a quick deal to show they can fix crises in the world, perhaps in contrast to the Clintons, Bushes and Obamas, without any military intervention, and this can be presented as a success in this electoral year,\u201d said Kurti.\nHe accused Grenell of being disinterested in the substance of any deal and of being focused only on getting \u201cthe signature on the bottom of the paper\u201d as soon as possible.\nAfter Trump\u2019s failure to make progress on a deal with North Korea or in the Middle East, it is possible that the White House now sees that Balkans as the best bet for a diplomatic breakthrough, but time is running out before the November election.\nBelgrade refuses to recognise the independence of its former province, which split off from Serbia after a bloody crackdown by Belgrade triggered a Nato bombing campaign in 1999.\nA deal would ideally pave the way for Kosovo to take up a seat at the UN and for both countries to become EU members in future. The most controversial aspect of discussions has been talk of a possible land swap. Parallel talks between the two countries have been held under EU auspices.\nKosovo\u2019s president, Hashim Tha\u00e7i, has proved more receptive than Kurti to US overtures, and on Sunday Grenell wrote on Twitter that he had spoken to Tha\u00e7i and to Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, \u201cto make clear they must start building confidence today in preparation\u201d for dialogue. He denied that he or anyone else in the discussions had mentioned a land swap.\nTha\u00e7i wrote on Twitter on Sunday that he would form a new government this week, though it is unclear whether he can do so constitutionally without new elections. The Covid-19 crisis would appear to make elections and any major protests against the situation impossible for now.\n\u201cThey are hoping that coronavirus will last and people will have to stay indoors,\u201d said Kurti. As of Monday, Kosovo had 561 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 12 deaths.",

London Live said this was particularly important in the current circumstances, when civil liberties are being \u201cconstrained\u201d and \u201cthreatened\u201d. The station also said it was essential to question \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d and government action in a \u201cresponsible\u201d manner.\nAmong the material London Live covered were assertions by Icke that Covid-19 was being used as a weapon of war by the US and Israel against Iran, as well as suggestions that any plan to immunise the world with a coronavirus vaccine was a plot to infect people with a \u201ctidal wave of toxic shite\u201d.\nThe broadcast was edited by London Live staff from a longer interview conducted for the similarly named but unrelated YouTube channel London Real.\nIn a sign of how different forms of media are regulated, the London Live broadcast was watched by just 80,000 people, but has attracted regulatory scrutiny and sanctions. Meanwhile, a version of the original London Real interview remains available on YouTube, where it has racked up almost 6m views with no regulatory issues.\nLondon Live unsuccessfully argued that it would be \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for Ofcom to penalise it for broadcasting material that was still available on YouTube. A different interview involving Icke and London Real has been removed by YouTube, although none of it was broadcast on London Live.\nIcke has enjoyed the attention paid to him as a result of the controversy around the broadcast, with Google search interest in his name spiking as a result.\nOfcom separately concluded that Holmes\u2019s comments on ITV\u2019s This Morning that people should challenge \u201cthe state narrative\u201d around 5G phone masts \u201cwere ill judged and risked undermining viewers\u2019 trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence\u201d.\nAlthough it said this was irresponsible, given recent attacks on mobile phone masts in the UK, it concluded that his subsequent clarification and other comments making clear the link was \u201cfake news\u201d meant there was no need to formally sanction ITV.",

        "content": "Prime minister will remain in office for 18 months before handing position to his rival\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his main rival, Benny Gantz, have agreed to form a national unity government, ending a year-long political crisis that has seen the country hold three back-to-back elections.\nA copy of the power-sharing agreement said Netanyahu, currently the interim leader, would remain in the role for 18 months before handing over to Gantz, a former army chief, for the remainder of a three-year term.\nThe announcement was a stunning turnaround for Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, who appeared to be flagging in recent weeks under the strain of three damning corruption indictments and mediocre election performance.\nHe is now likely to remain in office throughout his upcoming corruption trial and also gain significant influence over judicial appointments. Meanwhile, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White will take half of all ministries, including defence and foreign affairs.\nThe text also hinted at the potential annexation of parts of the Palestinian territories this summer, stating that Netanyahu could bring Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cvision for peace\u201d to a government vote from 1 July. The US plan, pre-emptively rejected by Palestinian leaders, gives Israel full military control over Palestinians, much of their land and all of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements.\nBoth Netanyahu and Gantz support Trump\u2019s plan. Mohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, warned that the formation of what he called \u201can Israeli annexation government\u201d would dismantle the rights of the people of Palestine.\nMinutes after Monday\u2019s power-sharing agreement was announced, Netanyahu tweeted a photo of the Israeli flag. Gantz said on Twitter that he had prevented a fourth round of elections, the likely outcome if no deal was reached.\nIt could take several days to pass legislation needed to formalise the agreement before the new government can be inaugurated.\nMany had expected the stalemate to hold following three inconclusive elections that produced similar results and with little progress made between the two rivals during months of talks. Without a fully functioning government, Israel has been unable to pass a budget.\nBoth politicians have been unable to forge majority coalitions on their own. Gantz was the latest to be tasked with forming a government after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy, but he failed to clinch a majority last week.\nOutbreaks of the coronavirus, which has put the country under lockdown, have added urgency to the need to break the deadlock.\nLast month, it was Gantz who appeared to back down on his longstanding demand that Netanyahu must leave power.\nThe opposition leader went against his own party, Blue and White, and nominated himself as speaker of Israel\u2019s parliament.\nBlue and White had planned to elect a different speaker, and push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment.\nBut Gantz nominated himself with the support of Netanyahu and his allies, with the apparent aim of protecting the prime minister from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.\nIn uproar, Blue and White swiftly disintegrated, amid allegations Gantz had broke his one main promise since he began his short career in politics less than two years ago: to oust Netanyahu.\nGantz said at the time that he was \u201cat peace\u201d with his decision.\n\u201cThis is the time for leaders to choose what is right and put the lingering issues and personal scores aside,\u201d he said, adding he would not \u201cdrag Israel to elections at this time of emergency \u2013 which will be with us for a long time, and whose repercussions are going to be long-term.\u201d\nUnder the unity deal signed on Monday, the two politicians will head a specific \u201ccoronavirus cabinet\u201d to deal with the pandemic.",

        "content": "Gipsy Hill man worked in similar conditions to many other convenience store staff\nThe frontline role of local convenience stores during the coronavirus pandemic and the heightened risk to their workers have come into the spotlight as tributes were paid to a popular staff member at a south London corner shop.\nUK data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease as women. The trend was first seen in China, where one analysis found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women.\n\nSince then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, South Korea and Italy, where men have accounted for\u00a071% of deaths.\nSo why are men more vulnerable?\n\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.\nEarly on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to the difference. Smoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.\nBehavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are\u00a0less likely to wash their hands,\u00a0less likely to use soap, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.\nHowever, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.\nHannah Devlin\u00a0Science correspondent\nThe man, identified for now only as Kumar, had worked at the Freshgo store in Gipsy Hill for more than 10 years. He died in hospital last week after displaying Covid-19 symptoms. Another worker from the same shop was also reported to be in hospital.\nAs tributes were paid to Kumar on a crowdfunding page set up to help support his family and on a community Facebook group describing him as a \u201ctireless worker\u201d, concerns were expressed about the exposure of those employed in the stores, where narrow aisles and single points of entry make physical distancing more difficult.\n\u201cKumar was always so kind and friendly and gave a big smile when I\u2019d go in with my son,\u201d Alicia Aleksandrowicz said on the Facebook page. \u201cI had been worried about the staff there for a while given the size of the shop, and this seems truly unthinkable.\u201d\nMaking a donation on the crowdfunding site, Andrew Gurney said: \u201cKumar was an unsung hero \u2026 long hours, day and night, even before these troubling times. Then to stay open and working in such a close environment for the sake of the community was the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d\nHis death is the latest in a sector providing employment to a significant number of middle-aged men, a group regarded as being at a higher risk than some others, and which also has a large component of people from BAME backgrounds, a demographic that is already bearing a disproportionate brunt of the impact of Covid-19.\nIt comes days after another death, that of Raj Aggarwal, whose last Facebook post showed him dropping off a carload of tea, coffee and biscuits to hospital workers, and who was a board member of the the Association of Convenience Stores.\nThe ACS\u2019s chief executive, James Lowman, wrote on his blog: \u201cThis is a terrible loss that will be felt personally by many people in our industry, and it should also remind us: there are people putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to help the country through these difficult times, and to lose one of them in Raj is a hard thing to comprehend and accept.\u201d\nHe told the Guardian that challenges facing the sector included issues around sourcing and using personal protective equipment (PPE). While public health experts are currently not recommending the use of face coverings, shop owners have been improvising masks of different types, as well as dipping into their own funds to erect screens.\nSome shops have received government support, but others, such as those on petrol station forecourts, have seen sales collapse \u2013 although in the main there had been an big increase in sales, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a sustained growth in sales, though the pandemic has changed how people have been using our shops,\u201d said Lowman. \u201cIndividuals are tending to make fewer visits, but are loading bigger baskets. While the average spend in \u2018peacetime\u2019, if you want to call it that, might be on average \u00a36.50, that has now doubled. People are also buying different things, so less confectionery perhaps and more household supplies.\u201d\nDespite this, he added, extraordinary costs were mounting, including for PPE and the cost of employing an extra person in some cases to act as a marshal at the doors.",

Before the government imposed lockdown measures, sales were up by as much as 50%.\nTim Dummer, the commercial director of IRI, which tracks sales at major grocery chains including supermarkets, said: \u201cSince the initial stockpiling and as social distancing restrictions limit retailers\u2019 capacity to service many more customers in stores, the UK market has begun to adjust to the new \u2018lockdown norm\u2019 and we see grocery sales begin to stabilise.\n\u201cUK shoppers continue to shop less frequently but spend much more each time. In some retailers we have seen [the amount spent on each visit] nearly double compared with previous-year levels.\u201d\nSales of alcohol, packaged foods such as pasta, toilet roll and tissues continued to post strong growth of more than 14%, while cosmetics sales slid by a third, newspapers by a quarter and toothbrushes and toothpaste by just over 10%.\nThe fastest-growing category in the UK last week was baking goods, up 49.3%, followed by canned meat and sausages.\nThe rise in frozen foods may reflect efforts to prepare for isolation at home and waste less during the period of economic uncertainty when many have lost work or taken a pay cut.\nSales of garden plants and flowers fell by 62.4%. While garden centres and many DIY stores are closed, supermarkets discounters and other chains monitored by IRI have also reduced the amount of space devoted to plants and flowers in order to focus on groceries and other essentials.\nThe drop in the sale of oral hygiene products is more mysterious. IRI said it could be a result of low demand after earlier stockpiling.",

        "content": "The Serb\u2019s views reflect how thin the line is between finding solace in spirituality and potentially projecting dangerous narratives, like opposing vaccination\nAfter a cool hour of discussion on Instagram live, as Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic reminisced on their rapport of 22 years, the most revelatory moment came right at the end and in the form of a seemingly mundane question delivered by a fan: What are the first three things you do after you wake up?\nDjokovic spoke slowly and deliberately in response: \u201cGratitude and prayer, a couple of long, deep breaths, hugging my wife and running to my children.\u201d Murray nodded limply, he successfully kept a straight face and at some point he even awkwardly uttered: \u201cNice!\u201d Then he gave his own answer: \u201cFor me, too much information, but I go for a pee.\u201d\nThe nature of Djokovic\u2019s job means that he speaks about himself after every single match, but normally he focuses his monologues on the tennis. It is easy to forget about how different his world view is to the rivals who surround him.\nAccording to Djokovic, his career was defined by the day a doctor placed a slice of white bread on his stomach. A subsequent resistance exercise indicated he had a coeliac allergy, which led to him relinquishing gluten from his diet and conquering the world. He calls telekinesis and telepathy \u201cgifts from this higher order, the source, the god, whatever, that allows us to understand the higher power and higher order in ourselves\u201d. He once hired a coach, Pepe Imaz, who probably taught him about telepathy and levitation, and whose techniques include extremely long hugs.\nEvidently, Djokovic\u2019s outlook has worked for him. He is the world No 1 on a 21-match winning run who is in pursuit of Rafael Nadal (19) and Roger Federer (20) in terms of grand slam titles, with 17. He will probably get there. His spirituality should be personal as long as it is not harmful.\nHowever, on Sunday afternoon as he congregated on Zoom with fellow Serbian athletes for a public discussion about the fate of their sports, Djokovic\u2019s comments reflected how thin the line is between finding solace in spirituality and potentially projecting dangerous narratives. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.\u201d\nEnter Djokovic\u2019s wife, Jelena, who at the beginning of April spread the viral video of medical professional Dr Thomas Cowan and his debunked theory linking 5G technology to the coronavirus outbreak. The video now carries a \u201cfalse information\u201d badge of shame on her Instagram. Instead of being one of the many to share a false video innocently, she doubled down.\nDjokovic\u2019s comments slip seamlessly into everything he has ever projected about his lifestyle and world view, but they also align with the dangerous way that anti-vaxxers discuss these issues and his wishes are dangerous. Videos such as Cowan\u2019s have led to the vandalisation of numerous 5G masts.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has underlined how personal decisions universally have the potential to affect many different people. Djokovic is no Keri Hilson \u2013 a minor celebrity who helped to spread 5G conspiracy theories \u2013 he is one of the most famous people in Serbia and opposing vaccinations carries an even greater danger.\nWhile they have also thrown his future into question, this stance seems reminiscent of his ideological opposition to surgery, which led to his split with Andre Agassi in 2017 after he resisted medical intervention and thought his elbow would heal with alternative, holistic treatments. Djokovic finally underwent surgery in 2018 and when he awoke, he cried for three days. \u201cEvery time I thought about what I did, I felt like I had failed myself,\u201d he told the Telegraph. \n  Clearly, he had not. \u201cOfficial\u201d medicine was the reason his pain abated. Five months later he lifted the Wimbledon title and by November he was back at No 1. Eventually, reality bites us all.",

A broad range of ideas, up to the possibility of a wage cap, will be under consideration.\nThe concept of an embargo originated with the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, which gives it a good chance of succeeding. A reluctance on the part of the players\u2019 union to countenance pay reductions has been one reason behind the gridlock.\nThe fact that players need a guarantee their clubs would not spend deferred wages elsewhere is one sign of the low levels of trust between the sides as negotiations over player pay remain unresolved at all levels of the professional game.\nLast week a one-month arrangement for deferring wages in Leagues One and Two was agreed, postponing a payday crisis for the month of April. This did not apply in the Championship, where negotiations have been conducted on a club-by-club basis, with some who have agreed to continue paying players in full now anxious that rivals who have deferred wages do not gain a competitive advantage when football finally returns.\nIt is understood that the PFA\u2019s suggestion of an embargo has not been taken up by the Premier League.",

I want to reassure you that we are working hard to find out as much information as possible in the days and weeks to come,\u201d said Chris Leather, the RCMP chief superintendent, adding that officers were currently examining 16 crime scenes. \u201cWe will be in this for months to come.\u201d\nPolice said Gabriel Wortman, a 51-year-old denturist, disguised himself as a police officer before his first attack in the coastal town of Portapique on Saturday evening.\nThe victims included a teacher, nurse, police officer, social worker and three married couples. Wortman was shot dead by police following a standoff late Sunday morning.\nWith Nova Scotia already in lockdown in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Trudeau acknowledged the grieving process would be especially difficult, announcing a virtual Facebook vigil on Friday at 7pm.\n\u201cWe are a country that stands united in our effort to defeat a pandemic, save lives and to help each other make it to a better day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yesterday we were jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy.\u201d\nThe chaos began late Saturday evening, when police responded to emergency calls in Portapique. Residents told local media that Wortman set fire to numerous properties \u2013 including his own \u2013 and shot people fleeing for safety.\nOfficers found \u201cseveral casualties\u201d inside and outside at a house in Portapique at 11.30pm, but couldn\u2019t locate a suspect.\nOn Monday, police said they anticipated finding additional victims in the remains of buildings that were burned down.\nAuthorities haven\u2019t yet determined a motivation for the attacks, but the fact that Wortman had created a replica RCM vehicle and \u201ceither a real uniform or a perfect facsimile\u201d suggested his early actions were deliberate, said Leather.\n\u201cHis ability to move around the province undetected was surely greatly benefited by the fact that he had a vehicle that looked identical in every way to a marked police car,\u201d Leather said.\nOne resident told the Globe and Mail that Wortman arrived at his house Sunday morning, dressed as a police officer and driving what appeared to be a police car. Brandishing a pistol and rifle, Wortman began pounding on the door. \u201cHe came here to kill me,\u201d the man told the Globe and Mail. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\nThe man and his wife hid until Wortman left. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t killing enemies, he was killing his friends,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was trying to beat down our door. It was beyond terrifying.\u201d\nWortman eventually swapped his police cruiser replica for a silver SUV on Sunday, leading police in a chase down a busy highway, culminating in a fatal shootout at a gas station in the town of Enfield.\nOn Monday, police faced questions over why they didn\u2019t send out text alerts to warn residents of an active shooter in the region, instead relying on Twitter to keep the public updated. Many rural communities in the province lack access to high-speed internet.\nPolice said the victims included a police officer who was shot after responding to reports of the shooting on Sunday morning. Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two, had served on the force for 23 years.\n\u201cWe have lost one of our own while she was protecting others,\u201d said Leather. \u201cThis is the definition of a true hero.\u201d\nAs news of the shootings spread, family members and friends eulogized the victims on social media.\nAmong the dead was Tom Bagley, who was killed as he rushed to help victims.\n\u201cThis beautiful soul was taken from me so unnecessarily. I can\u2019t even comprehend it,\u201d his daughter Charlene wrote on Facebook.\nHeather O\u2019Brien, a nurse and grandmother from the town Truro in central Nova Scotia, was remembered for her kind spirit.\n\u201cThe pain comes and goes in waves. I feel like I\u2019m outside of my own body,\u201d wrote her daughter Darcy Dobson, who described texting her mother minutes before she died \u2013 and the \u201cmonster\u201d that killed her. \u201cI want everyone to remember how kind she was \u2026 Let those things define her. Not the horrible way she died.\u201d\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s niece Megan Brown remembered her aunt as a \u201chealer\u201d and a \u201cbright light\u201d.\nGreg and Jamie Blair, a husband and wife, were also among those killed. \u201cI have absolutely no words for the heartache my family & many others are going through,\u201d wrote Jessica MacBurnie on Facebook. The couple, married in 2014, leave behind their two children.\nLisa McCully, a teacher and mother of two, was also killed during the rampage, according to her sister and the Nova Scotia teacher\u2019s union.\n\u201cShe was somebody who taught from the heart,\u201d said the union president, Paul Wozney. \u201cShe taught her kids not just the curriculum but teaching about virtues and personal qualities.\u201d\nOn the Nova Scotia Kitchen Party Facebook group \u2013 originally created for residents to connect and sing together during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 members posted tributes to the victims and sang songs, including Amazing Grace.\nThe massacre in Nova Scotia is the worst of its kind in Canadian history, eclipsing the 1989 \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre, in which 14 women were killed in Montreal. A man driving a van deliberately ran over and killed 10 people in Toronto in April 2018 and a man shot dead six people at an Islamic cultural centre in Quebec City in 2017.\nIn his remarks on Monday, Trudeau also addressed children living in Nova Scotia.\n\u201cI know the world can seem like a mean and ugly place right now, but there\u2019s a whole lot of good in the world too. You\u2019ll see it in your neighbours and in Canadians in the days and months ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a difficult time and it can be a scary time too. But we\u2019re here for you and we\u2019re going to get through this together, I promise.\u201d\n This article was amended on 21 April 2020.

The difference this time is the manner in which the authors of the pieces dedicated themselves to going through each piece so meticulously.\nOne response was to a widely shared piece by the Sunday Times Insight team, which built the case that Britain wasted five weeks in appreciating the threat of the virus due to mismanagement and a focus on Brexit at the top of government. Sources said those involved in the \u201cteam effort\u201d to respond to the piece included some of Boris Johnson\u2019s political aides, one of Matt Hancock\u2019s key advisers, and a number of government officials, who worked throughout the day to challenge some of the points made in the piece.\nWhile some of the rebuttals were over semantics, others focused on specifics. One point complained that when the Sunday Times criticised the government for allowing 279,000 items of protective equipment to be sent from the UK to China in the early days of the outbreak, the newspaper failed to point out that 12m items had since come back in the other direction.\nHowever, government ministers may find that doing their own journalism is an equally fraught process. One of those quoted in the government\u2019s rebuttal was Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet medical journal. Horton himself is now rebutting the rebuttal, accusing the government of \u201cdeliberately rewriting history in its ongoing Covid-19 disinformation campaign\u201d.\nThe second piece that angered ministers was an article by Peter Foster in the Financial Times, which criticised the government\u2019s attempts to persuade industry to build new ventilators for hospitals. In a sign of changing attitudes to media, the government\u2019s 2,900-word rebuttal to this piece focused as much on Foster\u2019s tweets about the story as the original piece \u2013 potentially recognising that the number of people who read an individual article on a news website can often be smaller than the number of people who see a Twitter thread.\nAlthough both rebuttals were widely shared in political and journalism circles on Twitter, they are unlikely to reach a mass audience. The original Sunday Times piece already clocked in at just over 5,000 words. The government\u2019s response \u2013 setting out what they claimed to be a \u201cseries of falsehoods and errors\u201d in a piece that \u201cactively misrepresents the enormous amount of work that was going on in government at the earliest stages of the coronavirus outbreak\u201d \u2013 was 2,000 words long.\nInstead, a recently departed government press aide speculated that the real purpose may have been to blunt the impact of the critical narrative taking hold in other outlets and being repeated by broadcast news outlets that reach millions of people.\nA government source said they had always responded to articles perceived to be inaccurate: \u201cThe length of our rebuttal depends on how much we have to correct and how much any article misrepresents what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d",

And as long as I can\u2019t hug my friends, I won\u2019t feel that life is anything like normal.\u201d\nSimon, one of 10,000 secondary school students in the state of Brandenburg due to take their exams on Monday, under strict hygiene and physical distancing rules, said he was glad that he was being allowed to sit exams at all after some authorities discussed rewarding exam certificates based on average marks instead.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fancy being labelled my whole life as being one of those forced to get the \u2018emergency Abitur\u2019,\u201d he said, ahead of a geography exam and sipping on a latte bought from a cafe selling drinks from behind a perspex window in its doorway.\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s been an uncertain few weeks, which might affect my performance, I\u2019m glad to have the proper chance to show what I can do. Though the situation is far from normal,\u201d he added.\nKerstin Seefeldt was stacking the shelves of her Babelsberg bookshop, Script, eagerly preparing for a reopening on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing my customers properly again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m organising the shop so that the tables of books are like a labyrinth and customers can avoid coming into contact with each other.\u201d Only two customers will be allowed at a time in the 30 sq m space, she said.\nSeefeldt ran a thrice-daily bicycle delivery service for customers during the shutdown. \u201cIt has been an intense and rewarding time of mutual solidarity. But I know that the situation is far from normal, and so I will now keep up the delivery service for people considered to be in a risk category because I\u2019m aware that things cannot go back to normal for a long time yet, even if the shop is able to open,\u201d she said. She added she was relieved to have been helped through a financially difficult period by a government investment grant of \u20ac9000, news of which had reached her that morning.\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Germans on Monday to remain \u201cdisciplined and watchful\u201d, and warned that if attitudes towards the pandemic relaxed too quickly, another tougher lockdown may follow. \u201cWe must not lose track of the fact that we continue to be at the start of this pandemic and are far from out of the woods,\u201d she said.\nThanking Germans for \u2013 by and large \u2013 sticking to the rules of staying at home and keeping physical distance, Merkel said a lot had so far been achieved. \u201cThe infection is under control to the extent that it is not climbing exponentially any more,\u201d she said. But a \u201crash easing\u201d of the restrictions was in danger of unleashing the \u201cunknown\u201d, she warned.\nAcknowledging the plight of many people, including artists, single parents and restaurant managers,Merkel said Germans should not be \u201clulled into a false sense of security\u201d. If the infection rate began to rise \u2013 which would first be visible in the statistics in two weeks\u2019 time \u2013 \u201ca new shutdown would be unavoidable\u201d and that had to be prevented for the sake of the economy, she said.\nBut there are signs that social tensions are rising in parts of the country, and the sense that this is a critical moment in tackling the virus is keenly felt. At the weekend, police struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning on Berlin\u2019s Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz against what they saw as constraints placed on their basic rights due to the so-called Corona Verordnungen, or regulations. Amongst the protesters were anti-vaxxers, well-known conspiracy theorists, and rightwing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship. Other similar demonstrations have taken place elsewhere across Germany.\nBy Monday afternoon German health authorities had reported a total of 146,000 confirmed infections and 4735 deaths. The reproduction rate was slightly higher than on Friday, at 0.8, but anything under one is being considered a success by decision-makers.",

Brazil has a population seven times larger than Peru.\nYet the response of the Peruvian president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, and his Brazilian counterpart could not be more different.\nWhile the Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has consistently flouted social distancing rules and downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic, Vizcarra is widely seen by Peruvians to have reacted decisively to the pandemic, deploying troops and the police to enforce a lockdown and a nightly curfew.\nVizcarra said on Monday that the weeks ahead would be the most difficult and would require \u201ceveryone\u2019s highest capacity to respond\u201d.\n\u201cThe number of patients is close to exceeding the capacity of the health service,\u201d he said.\nAlonso Segura, a former Peruvian finance minister, said the mass movements of people to the countryside showed the state response was pushed to its limits, despite having launched a huge stimulus package worth 90bn soles (\u00a321bn) \u2013 equivalent to about 12% of GDP \u2013 last month, which included millions of fortnightly cash transfers to poor families.\nMore than 70% of Peruvians work in the unregulated economy, according to the country\u2019s statistics institute.\n\u201cThe government cannot push the severe lockdown much longer,\u201d said Segura. \u201cCompanies are going bankrupt and the desperation of the people is increasing. More than an economic issue, it\u2019s a social issue,\u201d he added.",

The zoo has been shut to the public during the lockdown, with keepers, deemed essential workers, working split shifts to stay safe.\nUnable to earn any income from visitors, which usually accounts for 95% of its revenue, the zoo is now struggling to pay its weekly NZ$70,000 (US$42,000) food bills, and has appealed to the general public for help. The gorillas alone eat NZ$800 (US$485) worth of vegetables every week.\nIn just four days more than 4,000 Kiwis have donated more than NZ$230,000.\nThe wildlife park is the country\u2019s only open-range zoo and is home to over 70 species of endangered animals from New Zealand and around the world.\nAccording to the givealittle appeal, the government\u2019s wage subsidy only covers 40% of the park\u2019s operating costs.\n\u201cThese costs are impossible to put on hold and include enormous food bills, huge electricity bills to keep our animals warm in the cooler weather and essential veterinary costs,\u201d the appeal reads.\n\u201cOur important New Zealand native conservation work continues, such as Kiwi chicks have recently hatched and must have access to heated brooder units in these crucial early stages.\u201d\nThe huge sum raised will be enough to keep the park operational under the extended lockdown, with hopes cooped up Kiwis will flock back for visits with the animals \u2013 many of whom are missing their human friends \u2013 once restrictions are eased.\nMore than 1,400 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in New Zealand and 12 people have died.

But as the country prepares to move from alert level four to alert level three \u2013 meaning from a major lockdown to a moderate lockdown \u2013 patriotism seems irresistible. In the prime minister, yes, in the public service, for sure, and in the essential-service workers stocking the supermarket shelves, staffing the ports and distribution centres, and caring for Covid-19 patients in hospitals and the community. It almost feels detaching, especially as countries like the US and UK hit their peaks, that life in these islands could resume as normal, as if the virus were only a four-week nightmare.\nBut life isn\u2019t returning to a normal we would recognise. Or at least a normal our pre-lockdown selves would recognise. Schools can open, but with new rules and restrictions, and some businesses can trade as long as they adhere to strict hygiene and social distancing rules. Our \u201cbubbles\u201d must remain more or less the same.\nBut the burdens and the sacrifices of the lockdown fall unevenly. In Kawerau, where I live, a town with the worst deprivation statistics in the country, lockdown is punishing. Queues outside the local supermarket form hours before it\u2019s open. Yet queues at the sister supermarket in Whakat\u0101ne \u2013 a larger and wealthier town \u2013 are almost nonexistent. The difference? Well, wealth and income. In Kawerau most people live day to day, meaning a weekly shop or even a panic buy are out of the question. Most people are queuing for one or two basics, and they\u2019ll queue again as soon as they can pull together enough money for one or two additional basics, and maybe a luxury buy if the supermarket bosses keep their lockdown prices low.\nIt\u2019s tempting to think about lockdown and all the big and small sacrifices it demands, as just that \u2013 a sacrifice. But I think framing our experience in the negative misses the point. Lockdown is solidarity. Every moment where we adhere to the rules \u2013 like keeping your distance as you walk the dog or washing your hands as regularly and thoroughly as possible \u2013 we act in solidarity. Social distancing helps keep other people safe. Every time I potter around the house I hope \u2013 and quite loudly \u2013 that the government treats lockdown and the post-lockdown world in the same tradition, extending support to the vulnerable as a matter of solidarity. That means extending the already existing wage subsidy, but it also means cancelling student debts, not extending another $1,000 loan.\nI could go on, but I\u2019ll leave the manifesto for another time.\nFour weeks ago I was looking down my nose at people who were treating lockdown as an opportunity for \u201cpersonal development\u201d. When the stakes are this high, and the virus is only an outbreak away from taking thousands of lives, focusing on the personal struck me as luxurious and self-indulgent. Yet here I am spending every day thinking about loving gestures and words to help close the physical distance between my partner and I, the two of us caught in lockdown at different ends of the country. I suspect this means I\u2019m doing personal development, too. But I take this as solidarity as well. I mean, what\u2019s solidarity if not a love, and action, taken for others?\nThe chief benefit of lockdown, at least for a middle-class person like me, is it gives plenty of time (if not necessarily mental space) for pause and thought. Cutting back the shrubs last week, as you do under house arrest, I spent hours in the garden thinking through how, in the \u201cbefore times\u201d, we were all under pressure to approach life as a project in personal development. Not necessarily for spiritual or intellectual reasons, but for survival in an increasingly competitive world. Is returning to university a worthwhile \u201cinvestment\u201d? Is it possible to leverage one\u2019s hobby into a book deal? Is reading for knowledge or pleasure a waste of earning time? What strikes me about lockdown, though, and the incoming economic fallout, is it exposes those questions for what they are: false choices.\nIn the post-Covid world we\u2019re no longer in competition \u2013 and none of us can do \u201cpersonal development\u201d alone any more. What we require, for restructuring economies and rebuilding societies, is solidarity. I\u2019m grateful that, in New Zealand, we\u2019re already a small way there, even if there is more and more work to do.",

Employees who were still working would continue to be paid and the approximately 8,000 staff who have been stood down will continue to receive the jobkeeper allowance, he said.\nAn additional 6,000 contractors and 4,000 suppliers also rely on Virgin Australia, said the airline\u2019s chief executive, Paul Scurrah.\nBut while the airline will continue as is for the moment, Strawbridge said its future shape after exiting voluntary administration \u2013 including how many planes it had and how many routes it flew \u2013 was yet to be decided.\nVirgin Australia on Tuesday morning told the stock exchange it had appointed Strawbridge, John Greig, Sal Algeri and Richard Hughes of the big-four accounting firm Deloitte as administrators.\nThe move comes after the federal government rebuffed repeated requests from Virgin Australia for a bailout and despite duelling offers of assistance from the Queensland and New South Wales governments.\nScurrah said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the government wouldn\u2019t assist.\nHe said the airline had initially asked for a $1.4bn loan, convertible to equity in the company, and had gone back to the government eight times with new proposals.\nIts final request, for $200m, was rejected on Monday, and the company\u2019s board put the airline into administration that evening.\n\u201cThe correspondence that was going backwards and forwards was trying to structure it in a way that addressed the government\u2019s concerns around any criticism of potentially nationalising the airline or taking an equity stake,\u201d Scurrah said.\n\u201cBut ultimately, we didn\u2019t get there.\u201d\nVirgin Australia said it would \u201ccontinue to operate its scheduled international and domestic flights which are helping to transport essential workers, maintain important freight corridors, and return Australians home\u201d, and that Scurrah would remain in place.\nStrawbridge said flight credits remained valid but he would not guarantee their future value.\nSeparately, the airline\u2019s frequent flyer program, Velocity, which is not in administration, has frozen redemptions for at least four weeks.\nStrawbridge said more than 10 parties interested in recapitalising Virgin Australia would be sent a circular on Tuesday as part of a sales process that would start immediately.\n\u201cThe intent is to run hard and we can do that because we\u2019ve got a good sophisticated group of interested parties,\u201d he said.\nHe said he would be seeking expressions of interest within the next three weeks, after which a sales process would take four to five weeks before entering any transaction.\n\u201cI do think government has an important role to play, but it will not be \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 the decisive decision maker through this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe parties who are coming forward do have the financial capacity to take this business forward.\u201d\nPotential buyers include BGH Capital, a private equity fund run by Ben Gray, the son of the former Tasmanian premier Robin Gray.\nGray was formerly the Australian head of US private equity group TPG, which was behind the disastrous stock market float of the department store Myer in 2009.\nThe billionaire Richard Branson, who is a minority shareholder in Virgin Australia, said in most other countries national governments had stepped in to bail out airlines.\n\u201cSadly, that has not happened in Australia,\u201d he tweeted.\nIn a direct attack on the airline\u2019s bigger competitor Qantas, which has campaigned against a bailout, he said Virgin Australia would fly again.\n\u201cThis is not the end for Virgin Australia and its unique culture,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNever one to give up, I want to assure all of you \u2013 and our competitor \u2013 that we are determined to see Virgin Australia back up and running soon.\u201d\nDear @VirginAustralia team. I am so proud of you and everything we have achieved together. This is not the end of Virgin Australia, but I believe a new beginning. I promise that we will work day and night to turn this into reality https://t.co/GJH1zhEqEd pic.twitter.com/GelLiA6DKG\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the collapse was \u201ca failure of leadership from Scott Morrison whose piecemeal approach to aviation did nothing to support the airline through this crisis\u201d.\n\u201cThe current structure of our aviation industry with two major airlines supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, promotes competition and ensures services regularly reach all Australians,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNow that he has let the airline fall into administration, Scott Morrison must outline a plan to take an equity stake in Virgin and ensure we continue to have two major airlines in this country.\u201d\nA former Transport Workers\u2019 Union head, Senator Tony Sheldon, implored the government not to take the same route as it did with Ansett Australia, which saw the airline collapse and cease to exist after attempts to refloat it failed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just say this very bluntly, and that is that Scott Morrison allows this company to bleed out, and allow corporate raiders to feed on the carcass of Virgin, then that\u2019s not a national aviation policy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a policy that sees 16,000 families in Australia not being stood up for by the prime minister.\u201d\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions said it was not too late for the government to rescue the company by acquiring a stake in the airline, arguing that a collapse would cost taxpayers dearly.\nIn a statement, the ACTU said a failure to rescue Virgin Australia would leave the government with an $800m bill to pay out the entitlements of the workforce under the fair entitlements guarantee scheme and \u201copen the door to a monopolistic takeover of our skies\u201d.\nThe ACTU president, Michele O\u2019Neil, said this was a \u201cdo or die\u201d moment for the government.\n\u201cIf the Morrison government does not immediately intervene, they will be responsible for the biggest airline collapse in Australia\u2019s history,\u201d she said.\nThe federal government has retained former Macquarie Bank chief executive Nicholas Moore to engage with Deloitte, signalling there may still be scope for some federal assistance.\nThe treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said Moore\u2019s role was to work with the administrators during the voluntary administration.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-known path for corporations to restructure and recapitalise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see a market-led solution.\u201d\nSpeaking on ABC radio before the announcement, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, again played down any prospect that the government might take part in a bailout.\nHe said the government had already provided support to the airline sector by waiving fees and charges on flights and subsidising domestic flights.\n\u201cVirgin had serious challenges prior to the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe do want to see two airlines continuing. There is a clear public interest in competition in the aviation sector in Australia. The first responsibility to bail out a company rests with its shareholders and Virgin has some very substantial foreign shareholders.\n\u201cIf those owners of the business are not prepared to step in there is a process here to test the market to see who else might be prepared to come forward and that is the opportunity in front of us.\u201d",

But at least we can do something about that\nMuch as I love toad breeding season for the way it brings thousands to Lightwood\u2019s ponds, it\u2019s actually a dangerous time for them. For seven evenings a friend\u2019s daily exercise involved patrolling a stretch of river with a bucket to retrieve trapped toads. This year we estimate that he, with minor contributions from others, including me, has saved 1,100.\nThe problem is that toads arriving from the north and west are channelled, before they reach the spawning ground, into a stone-lined culvert that contains the flow of Hogshaw Brook. They are then blocked by a two-metre wall and are doomed, unless they can find a way over. One route for 30 of them was in the pockets of my smock, after which I released them on the lip of the water \u2013 a moment that felt wonderful for the old toad in my soul.\nUnfortunately, there are other hazards. In normal circumstances, a female acquires her mate en route to the pond or in the water. (Apparently it\u2019s the quality of his voice that determines her choice.) They couple and the female spawns. But a small number, possibly the largest females, are subjected to a frenzy of attention from mateless males. They can become completely enfolded in would-be suitors and loll helplessly, the males with faces squashed on some part of her as if to smother her in adoration; in these stressed circumstances, she can drown.\nI observed one aggregation where the female surfaced intermittently as the whole body-ball slowly, randomly, revolved in the water. Occasionally she would roll on her back, her pale belly globed at the surface, her powerful arms and legs spread, when there was about her an aura of extraordinary forbearance but little pleasure.\nThis passivity is not always maintained. I saw a neighbouring toad ball in which the female twisted and roiled in the middle of her male pack. They fell away and she issued a final sequence of powerful strokes with her legs to batter any last suitors. Eventually she was free, except for one male, and she swam away with enormous vigour like some immense beast with a small child on its back.",

        "content": "Are jobs safe? What about my frequent flyer miles? Will flying become more expensive? These and other questions answered\nOn Tuesday Virgin Australia went into external administration after being crushed by a $4.8bn debt mountain and failing to secure a federal government bailout.\nThe decision affects about 10,000 staff and 6,000 contractors who work for the airline, along with 4,000 suppliers and customers who have bought tickets worth more than $1bn but haven\u2019t yet flown, as well as holders of Velocity frequent flyer points.\nHere\u2019s what it means and how it affects you.\nIt\u2019s against the law for company directors to continue to trade when they know the company can\u2019t meet its debts as and when they fall due. When directors realise their enterprise is in danger of going broke, they can appoint insolvency practitioners to act as administrators.\nThe administrators step into the shoes of the directors and have additional powers, including the ability to disclaim contracts or property that are costing money.\nThey can also negotiate an exit from administration, handing the company back to directors, through what\u2019s called a \u201cdeed of company arrangement\u201d, or Doca.\nThis is what Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators, Deloitte, are aiming for.\nUnder a Doca, debts can be settled for cents in the dollar and different classes of creditors can be treated differently.\nThis requires the approval of more than half of the creditors, both by number and amount of money owed.\nIt could have been, if the federal government had been willing to put aside its dislike of nationalisation and take a stake in Virgin Australia.\nVirgin Australia originally asked for a $1.4bn loan from the government, which could be converted into shares, but on Tuesday the chief executive, Paul Scurrah, revealed that by Monday this had dwindled to a request for $200m.\nThis was rejected.\nWhen the Virgin board met on Monday, members were confronted with a $4.8bn pile of debt that needed to be repaid, cash spending of millions of dollars a day and no government lifeline.\nRather than carry on and risk trading while the company was insolvent, they appointed Deloitte as administrators.\nDuring the period of administration, Scurrah said there would be no redundancies and all Virgin employees would keep their jobs.\nMost are stood down at the moment and Virgin is accessing the federal government\u2019s jobkeeper scheme (available when companies lose 50% of their revenue). This will ensure each employee receives $1,500 a fortnight.\nBut there are no guarantees about what will happen to jobs after the company is recapitalised and has new owners.\nIf it survives through the administration, it is likely to emerge as a very different airline. Scurrah predicted: \u201cWe\u2019ll come back leaner, stronger and fitter.\u201d That sounds like job losses.\nScurrah said all Virgin employees\u2019 entitlements, such as holiday pay, long service leave and redundancy provisions, were preserved and the company had cash reserves.\nEmployees rated at the top of the pile for \u201ccirculating assets\u201d like cash, he said. This puts them just behind lenders who hold mortgages over Virgin Australia\u2019s fleet of planes.\nBut during the collapse of the airline Ansett Australia in 2001-02, entitlements became a major issue as many long-term employees were owed large sums.\nIt\u2019s too early to say what will happen to working conditions in a recapitalised airline. That will depend on the new owners.\nNot if Deloitte\u2019s Vaughan Strawbridge and his fellow administrators can successfully sell the whole airline to a new owner.\nBut even they succeed, the size and shape of Virgin Australia would depend on what the new owner wanted to do with it.\nFor example, it could cut unprofitable routes that service regional Australia, or international flights.\nAll this could make Virgin Australia a lot less competitive against Qantas.\nIt could, but it\u2019s too early to tell. Again, it depends on how deep the pockets of a new buyer are \u2013 and how much the new Virgin Australia wants to take on Qantas.\nExperts say that without two airlines slugging it out, prices will inevitably go up.\nVelocity isn\u2019t in administration but, after a run on points on Tuesday, it froze redemptions for four weeks.\nStrawbridge says the Velocity business is a valuable part of Virgin Australia and he\u2019d prefer to sell it along with the airline.\nVelocity is also the source of some of the company\u2019s debt woes, as in November Virgin Australia raised about $700m in junk bonds to take full control of the points business, which it had partly sold off.\nWhat the points will be worth under a new owner isn\u2019t clear.\nScurrah said people with bookings on Virgin should \u201cexpect to fly\u201d once the restrictions on travel are lifted.\nThe plan was to keep flying during administration, he said.\nScurrah said there was no intention to cancel flight credits and that the goodwill associated with those credits would be worked through with interested parties. In other words, flight credits are safe for the time being.\nThe administrator has said there are more than 10 interested parties. Names that have been mentioned include Ben Gray\u2019s private equity firm, BGH Capital, which has been combing through Virgin\u2019s books. A current shareholder, the Abu Dhabi-backed airline Etihad, is also said to be interested, although with international air traffic all but shut down by the crisis Etihad has financial strife of its own.\nThe Queensland government has also offered support, provided the airline retains its headquarters in Queensland, while New South Wales is yet to reveal its hand.\nThe NSW treasurer has confirmed it is in discussions with Virgin and the administrator, and would likely insist the airline be based in western Sydney.\nRichard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group, which owns 10.42% of Virgin Australia, was willing to put up between $200m and $250m during pre-administration talks and the tycoon has expressed sadness about what has happened.\nBut, as Scurrah noted, his investments in cruising, airlines and hotels overseas mean he will have many pressures on his wealth.\nOver the coming weeks the bidders are likely to coalesce into two or three consortiums that have a real chance of buying the airline.",

Workers claim the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave.\n\u201cWe are calling out because Amazon is putting its revenue above our safety,\u201d Jaylen Camp, an Amazon worker at a fulfillment center in Romulus, Michigan, and a member of United for Respect told the Guardian. \u201cWe are not essential to them \u2013 they just think of us as numbers and quotas. They are not protecting our health.\u201d\nProtesting employees say they will continue to call in sick until Amazon makes safety-related changes at warehouses. The action comes as Amazon is set to announce what are expected to be record high quarterly earnings results.\nWorkers in more than 130 warehouses around the country have contracted Covid-19, according to numbers from United for Respect, with some warehouses reporting more than 30 confirmed cases.\nThe workers are calling on Amazon to \u201cimmediately close down\u201d any facilities with Covid-19 cases and provide testing and two weeks of pay for workers during that time. Amazon has promised to pay workers who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus, but workers say it has been difficult to actually receive paid sick time, and some have been coming to work with fevers, United for Respect said.\nThey are also demanding paid sick leave and asking Amazon commit not to retaliate against associates who speak out. Workers are also requesting the elimination of quotas that require employees to scan a certain number of items and pack a certain number of boxes per hour. Even as Amazon requires workers to wash hands for 20 seconds after sneezing or using the restroom, Camp and other workers say these quotas leave little time to wash hands and keep safe on the job.\nAmazon has been cracking down on employee organizing in recent months. This month, workers have walked off the job in New York, Illinois and Michigan in protest. One worker who led the protest in New York was fired for his actions. The company also fired two white-collar workers this month for denouncing the Amazon\u2019s treatment of warehouse workers.\nA report published on Monday by Business Insider revealed that Whole Foods, the Amazon-owned grocery store, has been tracking employees and their likelihood to unionize in an attempt to discourage organizing.\nCamp said he initially avoided participating in protests out of fear of retaliation, but  changed his mind in recent weeks.\n\u201cSomething has to be said about what is going on\u201d, he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything we are going to keep being treated as numbers, pie charts and dividends instead of people.\u201d\nAmazon previously told the Guardian it terminated the employees in question for violating internal policies. A spokeswoman told the Guardian that Amazon has increased frequency of cleaning in warehouses in light of coronavirus and is encouraging social distancing.\nRachael Lighty, an Amazon spokesperson told the Guardian that the protesters\u2019 accusations that Amazon is not taking enough safety measures were \u201cunfounded\u201d.\n\u201cNothing is more important than the safety of our teams,\u201d she said. \u201cOur employees are heroes fighting for their communities and helping people get critical items they need in this crisis.\u201d\nAnother spokeswoman at Amazon noted that employees who are proven to have a fever of more than 100.4F will be sent home from their shift and paid for up to five hours of their scheduled shift that day.\nWorkers with United for Respect say this policy has led many employees to take Tylenol and other fever-suppressing medication so they can continue to work and not miss out on paychecks.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration has opened an investigation into a Pennsylvania warehouse over worker complaints there, and the Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, temporarily shut down a warehouse in the state after a spate of positive cases.",

This would not be possible until the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, 73, is allowed out of the shielded lockdown which currently applies to people over 70.\nThe inquiry was suspended on 16 March, ahead of the national physical distancing measures, when it was cross-examining executives from construction companies involved in the disastrous refurbishment that fuelled the fire.\nMoore-Bick is keen to restart proceedings, and Featherstone said that to wait for normality to return risks a delay of months and possibly longer, which is \u201cnot in the public interest\u201d as the work of the inquiry is \u201can urgent matter of public safety\u201d.\nIn a letter sent on Monday, she told hundreds of core participants that the Zoom system \u201cworked well enough to be able to obtain the evidence required without loss of audio-visual quality, undue interruption or compromising participation\u201d.\nShe said the technology was approved as safe by the government in consultation with the National Cyber Security Centre and concluded: \u201cThere is little doubt that the system provides a functionally feasible way of obtaining the oral evidence required.\u201d\nBut she said that giving evidence from home while under lockdown may be \u201ctraumatic\u201d for witnesses, some of whom might not consider home a relaxed location, but rather \u201ca place of domestic tension\u201d. And she said there would be no immediate access to an NHS counsellor, which might undermine the inquiry\u2019s duty of care to witnesses.\nAnd in a consideration that will be familiar to people working from home under lockdown, she added: \u201cIt may be difficult for witnesses to keep pets, children and other distractions out of the room\u201d.\nFeatherstone said the inquiry\u2019s view was that only witnesses who are willing to give evidence remotely should do so.\nSome survivors are understood to be concerned that witnesses who are due to be heard, including politicians and officials at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and its tenants management organisation, would feel less scrutinised giving evidence remotely. Featherstone said they \u201cmay not feel the same pressure to be candid\u201d and it was difficult to prevent them being \u201cfed answers\u201d.\n\u201cThere is, for example, no reliable way of knowing whether a third party is prompting a witness by mobile phone or email to which the witness has ready access,\u201d she said.\nThe option to restart only when the inquiry could be conducted as it was before Covid-19 would \u201callow the dignity and solemnity of hearings to be maintained\u201d, but would mean a long delay. The hybrid option, relying as it does on Moore-Bick being allowed out of isolation, \u201cis likely to involve a delay of some months, possibly many months,\u201d Featherstone said.\nShe concluded \u201cthere is no easy solution\u201d and asked for responses by next Monday.",

        "content": "Devastating 2019-20 fires estimated to have released 830m tonnes of carbon dioxide, more than all bar five countries in the world\nAustralia\u2019s devastating bushfire season is likely to have released 830m tonnes of carbon dioxide, far more than the country\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution, according to a government estimate.\nIf compared with international emissions, it suggests the Australian temperate forest bushfires between September and February would rank sixth on a list of polluting nations, behind only China, the US, India, Russia and Japan.\nThe federal government analysis of the fires says temperate forests usually eventually recover from bushfire and they were expected to reabsorb most of the released carbon dioxide in the years ahead.\nIt cites the example of the 2003 fires that overran the Australian Capital Territory. It is estimated 96% of the carbon dioxide released then had been absorbed in regrowth by 2019. But the report notes rising climate change impacts, including droughts or more frequent and intense fires, could affect the ability of forests to recover.\nOther scientists have been less optimistic about the capacity of Australian forests to reabsorb all emissions released during bushfires, warning under normal conditions it could take decades for enough regrowth to occur and the climate crisis was increasing the risk of repeat fires within shorter timeframes.\nBy 11 February, the 2019-20 fires had burned 7.4m hectares of temperate forest, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria.\nThe report makes clear the area affected is unprecedented. The graph below, based on historical and satellite data, suggests 50% more burned than in any previous year dating back to 1850.\nMore than 40% of the area burned, an estimated 3.14m hectares, lies within national parks. Another 1.86m hectares is labelled \u201cother conservation and natural environments\u201d.\nAbout 1.8m hectares is described as \u201cproduction native forests\u201d \u2013 state forests available for logging by the timber industry.\nThe data does not include woodlands and grasslands in northern and central Australia, which tend to burn to some extent every year, in part through traditional Indigenous land management.\nFires in these parts of the country tend to burn a much larger area each year, but the net emissions and impact on people and wildlife is less than that in temperate forests in the southeast. There is less fuel and carbon sequestration due to regrowth is considered to usually balance emissions from new fires.\nThe report says bushfire emissions are expected to have little impact on whether Australia meets its targets under the Kyoto and Paris climate agreements. Pollution from national disturbances are considered beyond human control are not counted under UN greenhouse accounting rules.\nIt says the recovery of the forest is expected to be \u201ccomplete\u201d. \u201cHowever, the department will actively monitor the forest recovery from the bushfires to ensure that any future human disturbances, such as salvage logging, future fire disturbance and the impacts of changes in climate are taken into account,\u201d it says.\nThe report does not consider bushfire damage beyond emissions, including the impact on hundreds of species. In the immediate aftermath of the fires, a government analysis found 113 species needed urgent attention, estimating at least 30% of their habitat had been burnt. In Victoria, it is estimated about 70% of the state\u2019s remaining warm temperate rainforest and more than half the habitat of at least 170 rare and threatened species was affected.\nAustralia emits about 530m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. The most recent government greenhouse gas data suggests the country is not on track to meet its 2030 target, a 26% to 28% cut below 2005, without the use of an accounting loophole. Analysts say Australia should be aiming to do far more than its current target if it is to play its part in meeting the goals set in Paris.",

        "content": "The director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies says our government\u2019s approach is putting prisoners and the public at risk\n\u201cInaction by government on Covid-19 in UK prisons is putting not just prisoners\u2019 lives at risk but also prison staff, and the general public,\u201d says Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, which has just launched a Europe-wide project to collate and compare the measures taken by different governments and prison systems.\n\u201cIf you set out to create an institution with the express intent of concentrating and transmitting Covid-19, it would probably look much like a prison,\u201d he adds, especially one as overcrowded as many in the UK.\nRichard Coker, a leading epidemiologist and emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agrees. He describes prisons as \u201cepidemiological pumps\u201d.\nTo deal with overcrowding, prisons have been told to \u201ccohort\u201d \u2013 quarantine sick prisoners together. \u201cBut without proper testing,\u201d Garside points out, \u201cthis will be putting people with ordinary colds and flu in with Covid-19 cases and risking lives.\u201d\nCells may also be treated as households, so if one inmate develops symptoms, all occupants of that cell have to isolate together. \u201cAnd some cells do not even have the facilities to wash your hands,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cEven a short sentence for a minor crime is potentially a death sentence, puts staff at ongoing risk and provides a pool of reinfection for the wider community.\u201d\nCovid-19 is certainly spreading in jails. Official Ministry of Justice figures on Monday 20 April reported infection in more than half of jails in England and Wales, with 278 prisoners having tested positive, as well as 194 staff and eight staff from Prisoner Escorting and Custody Services. But real figures will be higher. Since tests are only done on admission to hospital, and hospitalisations are a fraction of cases, the actual numbers of inmates with Covid-19 in prisons are likely to be multiples of these figures.\nMoreover, confirmed deaths from coronavirus stand at 15 prisoners and one member of prison staff with two more suspected. Again, the MoJ admits these figures lag well behind reality.\n\u201cThe government has not approached this crisis with anything like the seriousness \u2013 or the speed \u2013 it required,\u201d says Garside. \u201cTo have any hope of controlling Covid-19 in prisons you have to have one to a cell, and to achieve that we need to remove at least 10,000 to 15,000 prisoners from the system.\u201d\nThe justice secretary, Robert Buckland, estimates that around 1,800 prisoners are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, and had they been in the community would have been told to isolate and shield themselves for three months. \u201cShielding is pretty much impossible in prison but nothing is being done to prioritise their release,\u201d says Garside.\nThe MoJ has begun temporarily releasing pregnant prisoners, and those in mother and baby units who do not pose a high risk of harm. But only 17 out of a potential 70 women have been released since the government announced the emergency measure three weeks ago, Buckland told MPs and peers this week. On 4 April the MoJ announced a plan to release 4,000 prisoners early on licence who were due for release in the next two months. Ten days later, just 14 prisoners had been released and after six men were released prematurely the scheme was suspended. It is expected to restart later this week. \n\u201cThe whole thing suspended for a handful of minor errors. Could this make any clearer the government\u2019s total lack of understanding of the urgency of this situation?\u201d asks Garside.\nAs in other essential sectors, lack of personal protective equipment has been an issue in prisons. Garside has received reports of staff having to take prisoners suspected of having Covid-19 to hospital while handcuffed to them.\nAbout a quarter of prison staff are off sick or self-isolating, putting further pressure on the system. Justice minister, Lucy Frazer QC, told the justice select committee last week that testing of staff began over the Easter weekend and should soon become routine.\nMeanwhile, visits to prisons have been halted, movement of prisoners reduced and collective activities stopped, but Garside says courts are still sending people to prison, even for relatively minor crimes like careless driving and petty drug offences.\nThe MoJ announced just before Easter that it is to create 500 temporary cells in the grounds of six prisons. Yet, according to Garside, this will have \u201calmost no impact on transmission \u2013 the vast majority of prisoners will still be in overcrowded conditions\u201d.\nSome other European countries have reacted more proactively than this country to reducing the spread of Covid-19 in prisons. Hence the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies\u2019 project to create a \u201cknowledge base\u201d of European responses on which all can draw. At least 12 countries are already involved and data will be released on a rolling basis from next later this week, with collation and analysis to follow. \u201cIt won\u2019t exactly reveal best practice; nobody is doing it brilliantly. But at least better practice,\u201d says Garside.\nAustria, for instance, is deferring prison sentences shorter than three years for non-dangerous offenders, as are parts of Germany. Finland is doing the same for sentences of less than six months (and it sends far fewer people to prison to start with). Italy, which has already seen prison riots, has reduced its prison population by 6,000 in six weeks, and France by 10,000 in the last month, and Ireland has doubled temporary releases since the start of March.\n\u201cOur government must do more,\u201d he concludes. \u201cDrastic measures are being taken across the world with enormous consequences for liberty and economies. Millions of British citizens are in lockdown, yet our government seems unable to take some fairly modest steps to stop Covid-19 rampaging through the prison system. The justice secretary needs to demonstrate that he is up to the challenge of making these decisions. If he\u2019s not, maybe he needs to make way for someone who is.\u201d\nGarside has worked in the field of criminal justice reform for more than 20 years. He started because he believed that criminal justice was one of the most problematic areas of society. \u201cIt is expected to deal with deep societal problems when at best it can only manage rather than resolve them, and at worst it entrenches them. Prisons are a particular interest because the conditions are so awful and so many are held unnecessarily,\u201d he says. He has stayed in the field because \u201cthere is so much left to be done\u201d.\nSo does he think this crisis will lead to positive changes in our prison service? He says he fears not, \u201cbut I hope it will show up the terrible \u2013 overcrowded, unsafe, unsanitary - conditions in our prisons\u201d.\nHe adds: \u201cAnd if we can release thousands of prisoners in an expedited way and the sky doesn\u2019t fall in, then we could think about who we imprison and why, and consider different ways to sanction people. Some will always need to be contained, but prisons at the moment are a 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problem.\u201d\nAge: 51.Family: Married, two teenage children.\nLives: London.\nEducation: Simon Langton boys\u2019 school, Canterbury, Kent; University of Nottingham, BA Hons, theology (\u201cwhich confirmed me in my atheism\u201d).\nCareer: 2006-present: director, Centre for Crime and Justice Studies; 2010-present: senior visiting research fellow, the Open University; 20-2005: director, Crime and Society Foundation; 1998-2003: head of communications, Nacro, a national social justice charity; 1996-1998: press officer, Survival.\nInterests: Swimming, hill walking, piano, history and politics.",

And fathers can also play a unique role. \u201cFrom some of the studies we\u2019ve done, we know that the children of fathers who are more engaged \u2013 and usually that\u2019s in a playful way \u2013 tend to do better in terms of their behaviour and development,\u201d he says.\n\u201cRough and tumble play and other types of physical play can be great fun and can help children learn lots of different skills, such as physical coordination and self-control,\u201d he adds. \u201cDads can also get involved in a wide variety of play activities, including fun games and singing songs with younger children.\u201d\nHe says parents should not worry about the kind of play \u2013 \u201cchildren will learn and enjoy different things from different kinds of play, and taking the time to play with your children, getting stuck in, is the most important thing\u201d.\nWatch what your child is doing and try to follow their lead, doing what interests them. He says this responsive parenting is key to supporting young children\u2019s learning and social and emotional development. \u201cSlow down and let the child complete the task themselves, however long it takes, because that is how they learn.\u201d\n\u201cResearch looking at the effect of parents being playful is still underway, so it\u2019s difficult to answer the question about benefits of playful parenting from the science at the moment, but we do know that children being able to play freely is associated with better health outcomes and potentially lower stress,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe most important thing for young children in times of stress is receiving predictable care and love from parents or carers they trust, but time to play is going to help.\u201d\nSo does he get to play with bricks and plastic square heads all day? \u201cNo, it\u2019s a great job title, but I knew it wasn\u2019t going to involve \u2013 as some media headlines suggested \u2013 teaching posh students to play Lego.\u201d\nInstead, Ramchandani, a practising child psychiatrist and former professor of child and adolescent mental health at Imperial College London, has been tasked with leading Cambridge\u2019s research into the role of play in child development.\nHe warns that formalised education appears to be creeping down the age range, and he is not convinced that didactic learning environments for young children offer long-term benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence it does anybody any great good. I think we ought to be stopping and potentially reversing it.\u201d\nOpportunities for unstructured play in the early years are really important and expecting young children to sit and learn in structured environments for long periods does not fit with their developmental needs, he adds. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet seen any evidence that kids in systems that formalise education later do any worse. So I lean towards thinking we should formalise education a little later.\u201d\nRamchandani, 51, the son of a hairdresser and an accountant, was born in Maidstone, Kent. He went to state schools there and in Bristol, where his family moved, before studying medicine at Southampton University.\nAfter graduating he spent 10 years in the NHS and training as a child psychiatrist \u2013 he decided to focus on children after noticing that the roots of many adults\u2019 mental health problems often started in childhood.\nHe is critical of the UK\u2019s education structure, and in particular the focus on formal learning. \u201cI struggle with the way learning is set up in this country, in terms of the age at which we expect children to settle down and sit in class. Children at quite young ages are now being set \u2018learning goals\u2019. In my work as a child psychiatrist, I saw lots of boys, in particular, who get referred at six or seven because they\u2019re not able to sit still in class and attend to the lesson.\u201d\nWhile some will have severe neuro-developmental disorders, \u201cthere are a lot of others who end up in difficulty because they are just not quite ready for sitting still like that.\u201d They get unfairly labelled as \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cnot fitting in\u201d, he says.\nPlay, he says, is a child\u2019s way of exploring the world, learning about consequences, how things fit together and how relationships work. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand where play may work \u2013 because it\u2019s not that if we just leave children to free play, they\u2019re going to learn better. There\u2019s no evidence for that.\u201d\nThe question he wants to answer is this: \u201cWhere would play-based learning be best for aspects of children\u2019s learning and education, and where would another approach be better?\u201d\nThe lack of funding in state schools compared with the \u201camazing\u201d resources of many independent schools concerns him. \u201cThe fact that most children don\u2019t get those opportunities just seems to me to be tragic. I\u2019m not doing down the state system \u2013 I\u2019m very grateful for my state-school education, which provided me with tons of opportunities. But you see the difference in resourcing and opportunities. It\u2019s just staggering to me that this is an acceptable \u2018given\u2019 of society.\u201d\nInequality of opportunity from the start is the worst thing about the system, he says. \u201cI wonder what a visitor from another planet would make of it: that we\u2019re prepared to allocate children to massively different resourced education systems, just on the accident of their family\u2019s wealth. It\u2019s staggering. It\u2019s ridiculous. It narrows opportunity for everybody \u2013 and it means we\u2019re not making the most of the talents of the widest range of people, which is crazy.\u201d\nHe would like state school funding increased to provide more teachers per pupil, and more joined-up government thinking about the opportunities for children, particularly in their first few years.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any kind of coherent story about what landscape we want to create for our children. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking out for them. We\u2019re not thinking about them. And we really should be.\u201d",

        "content": "Coronavirus-hit Lombardy city will turn 35km of streets over to cyclists and pedestrians\nMilan is to introduce one of Europe\u2019s most ambitious schemes reallocating street space from cars to cycling and walking, in response to the coronavirus crisis.\nThe northern Italian city and surrounding Lombardy region are among Europe\u2019s most polluted, and have also been especially hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak.\nUnder the nationwide lockdown, motor traffic congestion has dropped by 30-75%, and air pollution with it. City officials hope to fend off a resurgence in car use as residents return to work looking to avoid busy public transport.\nThe city has announced that 35km (22 miles) of streets will be transformed over the summer, with a rapid, experimental citywide expansion of cycling and walking space to protect residents as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.\nThe Strade Aperte plan, announced on Tuesday, includes low-cost temporary cycle lanes, new and widened pavements, 30kph (20mph) speed limits, and pedestrian and cyclist priority streets. The locations include a low traffic neighbourhood on the site of the former Lazzaretto, a refuge for victims of plague epidemics in the 15th and 16th centuries.\nMarco Granelli, a deputy mayor of Milan, said: \u201cWe worked for years to reduce car use. If everybody drives a car, there is no space for people, there is no space to move, there is no space for commercial activities outside the shops.\n\u201cOf course, we want to reopen the economy, but we think we should do it on a different basis from before.\n\u201cWe think we have to reimagine Milan in the new situation. We have to get ready; that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to defend even a part of the economy, to support bars, artisans and restaurants. When it is over, the cities that still have this kind of economy will have an advantage, and Milan wants to be in that category.\u201d\nMilan is a small, dense city, 15km from end to end with 1.4 million inhabitants, 55% of whom use public transport to get to work. The average commute is less than 4km, making a switch from cars to active modes of travel potentially possible for many residents.\nWork could start on an 8km stretch of Corso Buenos Aires, one of the city\u2019s most important shopping streets, by the beginning of May \u2013 with a new cycle lane and expanded pavements. The remainder of the work will be completed by the end of the summer, officials say.\nJanette Sadik-Khan, a former transportation commissioner for New York City, is working with cities including Bogota and Milan on their transport recovery programmes. She says Milan, which is a month ahead of other world cities in the trajectory of the pandemic, could provide a roadmap for others.\n\u201cA lot of cities and even countries have been defined by how they\u2019ve responded to historical forces, whether it\u2019s political, social, or physical reconstruction,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe Milan plan is so important is because it lays out a good playbook for how you can reset your cities now. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take a fresh look at your streets and make sure that they are set to achieve the outcomes that we want to achieve: not just moving cars as fast as possible from point A to point B, but making it possible for everyone to get around safely.\n\u201cI know we\u2019ll be looking to Milan for guidance from New York City.\u201d\nPierfrancesco Maran, another of Milan\u2019s deputy mayors, said: \u201cWe should accept that for months or maybe a year, there will be a new normality, and we have to create good conditions to live this new normality for everyone.\n\u201cI think in the next month in Milan, in Italy, in Europe, we will decide part of our future for the next decade. Before, we were planning for 2030; now the new phase, we are calling it 2020. Instead of thinking about the future, we have to think about the present.\u201d\nIn the UK on Monday, Brighton started opening part of the seafront, Madeira Drive, only to pedestrians and cyclists from 8am-8pm. In Barnes, London, businesses and residents have coned off part of the road outside shopping parades to expand pedestrian space and help shoppers keep their distance from each other.\nMeanwhile in the Republic of Ireland, Dublin is suspending loading bays and parking spaces to increase space for social distancing, by using removable plastic separators.",

        "content": "The shambolic ballot and ensuing mess needs answers from the SPFL as the clamour for an independent inquiry grows\nIn a useful news diversion a bloated, 14-person task force formed to consider reconstruction in the Scottish Professional Football League convened for the first time on Monday. A vote will be required to approve any of its recommendations. No sniggering at the back.\nMeanwhile the chairmen of Aberdeen and Heart of Midlothian have joined their equivalent at Rangers by calling for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the ballot to abandon the 2019-20 season. This means 25% of the top division is seeking the same inquiry, which the SPFL \u2013 recently very keen on percentage mandates \u2013 has intimated no desire whatsoever to hold. \u201cThe SPFL looks an absolute mess,\u201d Steven Gerrard said last week.\nBut it is more serious than a PR fiasco. Ongoing doubt \u2013 triggered partly by a lack of transparency \u2013 into the governance of Scotland\u2019s national sport is unfair on customers. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s stark comments on Monday regarding the non-viability of football in Scotland any time soon, including behind closed doors, will set off alarm bells but the SPFL should not simultaneously be allowed to brush off a damaging saga.\nImmediately after Gerrard\u2019s comments, the Guardian asked the SPFL for clarity on its position on the convening of an independent investigation and received no reply. On Monday, the following straightforward questions were submitted. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anything further from the SPFL on the below,\u201d a spokesman replied.\nThese were the questions:\n1. Why does the SPFL remain reluctant to permit an independent investigation into the circumstances with chairs of 25% of the top division now supporting such a move?\nSpeaking on Sunday, the SPFL board member Les Gray said: \u201cThere is no wrongdoing here, we are absolutely certain of that. So there is no need for investigation in my view.\u201d This at least infers the SPFL has a predetermined position. So, too, the comments of the SPFL chairman, Murdoch MacLennan, to members: \u201cI am entirely satisfied, based on all the information at my disposal, that the SPFL and its executives and legal advisers have acted wholly properly at every stage in this process.\u201d\nBy allowing an independent investigation allegations of impropriety could be comprehensively dismissed. Moreover, given the language used by Rangers in particular, the league would have scope to fight back against highly damaging claims. Instead, the SPFL is strangely reticent to permit external focus.\n2. Why were emergency loans not detailed as an alternative financial distribution option in the paperwork sent out to clubs before the vote, with particular reference to the fact the league already had funds to pay end-of-season money?\nThe key basis for calling 2019-20 as it stands, as vehemently pushed by the SPFL board, was the release of end of season prize money. \u201cThe SPFL documentation received by all clubs on Wednesday 8 April made it clear that declaring the season ended was the only way to achieve distribution of funds and to then proceed to the next stage,\u201d a Raith Rovers statement said.\nHowever, it has emerged that the SPFL board has the power to issue emergency loans to clubs. This wasn\u2019t highlighted or explained when the paperwork to which Raith refer was issued. The league and its directors, naturally, need to be protected against loan defaults but there has been no articulation as to why any such payment would not be protected against - and limited to - prize money the SPFL had in its possession. The league appeared in a frantic rush to abandon the campaign.\n3. Will the league publish the electronic timeline of Dundee\u2019s two votes \u2013 and recall \u2013 from Friday 10 April? If not, why?\nDundee\u2019s role in this farce is now infamous. MacLennan explained it as thus: \u201cOne Championship club attempted to submit a voting slip, which did not reach the SPFL until late that evening. Earlier, at 6pm on Friday, that club had confirmed in writing to the SPFL that any attempted vote from that club should not be considered as cast.\u201d The precise reasoning for Dundee\u2019s subsequent volte face \u2013 no to yes \u2013 remain unclear.\nThe timings of Dundee\u2019s submissions will have an online template. The information contained therein is not remotely sensitive. In fact, one of their voting slips was in the public domain within 24 hours. There should be no problem with the league showing the public the exact details.\n4. As per the Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack\u2019s comments on BBC Scotland, why did the SPFL chief executive, Neil Doncaster, call him at 4.40pm on the aforementioned Friday?\nCormack said he had \u201cno problem\u201d with Doncaster calling him 20 minutes before the guidance deadline of 5pm for the vote to close. Yet Cormack stated Doncaster\u2019s advice was that Aberdeen\u2019s vote \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d because the top flight had already reached the necessary 75% threshold to call the season. So Aberdeen, who had been undecided on the resolution, were given notice of an irrelevant vote. Dundee sent in two.\n5. Which other clubs did Doncaster call that same day and why?\nAs the chief executive of the league, Doncaster is an official for all 42 member clubs. The SPFL board\u2019s strong wish for the resolution to pass was well known but if the chief executive was speaking to clubs on that theme, governance questions would be raised.\n6. What was the rationale behind the \u201cresult\u201d of an incomplete vote being published on 10 April?\nMuch of this wholly unacceptable affair can be traced to the SPFL\u2019s unprecedented decision to release \u201cresult\u201d figures with a number of clubs \u2013 including, crucially, Dundee \u2013 still to register a vote. The league has not addressed why this move was taken.\n7. Have the Championship clubs been asked if they felt threatened during the voting process?\nCormack said the vote was \u201cforced down our throats\u201d. Ann Budge, the Hearts owner, has raised the possibility of the SPFL board exerting \u201cundue influence\u201d on the resolution process.

        "content": "Natalia Kaliada and Nikolai Khalezin explain how political exile prepared them for lockdown and why their latest project is about fairytales\nThe coronavirus outbreak has forced theatre-makers to change the ways in which they collaborate, with many starting to make work remotely. But Belarus Free Theatre\u2019s founders, Natalia Kaliada and Nikolai Khalezin, have had to work this way for years. Exiled from their home country for a decade, and living in London, their circumstances have obliged them to find creative new ways of continuing to make work. \u201cWe were one of the first theatre companies to use Skype,\u201d explained Khalezin when we spoke earlier this year, \u201cbut this was a necessary measure. In 2011, when we ended up here and our cast was back in Belarus, we still needed to make shows, so we started trying out different technologies.\u201d\nTheir latest production is an adaptation of Alhierd Bacharevic\u2019s 2017 novel, Dogs of Europe, a 900-page dystopian political thriller with a section written in a language of Bacharevic\u2019s own design. It is considered one of the most important literary works ever published in Belarus. Kaliada and Khalezin, who are married, have been working with a composer in Toronto, one in Berlin and a video director in Kiev. From their kitchen in London, we watch a scene play out in a warehouse in Minsk, before Khalezin embarks on a discussion with one of the cast members about the feasibility of him running around the stage naked for the duration of the interval.\nIn the last few weeks, BFT has doubled its activities. When the UK went into lockdown they instructed their company in Minsk to self-isolate, though there had been no official guidance in Belarus about doing so. They then set about creating the Love Over Virus project, an attempt during a time of fear to \u201clet people dream again\u201d. Actors will be reading fairytales they were told as children, or that they tell their children, with contributions from trustees and supporters, including Juliet Stevenson and Samuel West, as well as Kaliada\u2019s own actor father, Andrej.\nThey are also resurrecting their Kitchen Revolution project, an online space for provocation, conversation and communal dining. A recipe is shared with participants, before they debate, among other things, how it is possible to survive our current situation, survival being an area in which the theatre-makers have considerable experience.\nThis year marks the company\u2019s 15th anniversary. Over that time, through a combination of tirelessness and fearlessness, they\u2019ve found ways of continuing not only to exist but to flourish creatively in a repressive environment: operating underground, risking arrest and worse. Shows are performed in private, such as in homes, garages, street cafes and outside the city in the woods, with audience members informed of the location via social media. In 2016, to mark their 10th anniversary, they simulated the experience for London audiences, keeping the locations \u2013 including a former ambulance garage \u2013 secret, and communicating with audiences by text.\nThe company\u2019s work made them a target of the authorities in Belarus. In August 2007, the entire BFT company, as well as the audience, were detained before their performance of an Edward Bond play. Company members have lost state jobs and been beaten up. In 2011, while abroad, they discovered they would face imprisonment if they returned to their home country. Driven into exile, they sought asylum in the UK.\nThey founded Belarus Free Theatre with the director Vladimir Shcherban in 2005. Khalezin was already an established playwright but, even though his work was not explicitly political, it wasn\u2019t allowed on the stage in Belarus. So they set about creating their own theatre, with no building but a clear ideological purpose. By 2006, they were touring internationally. It soon became apparent to Kaliada that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether it is a dictatorship or democracy, there is always a necessity for artistic provocation in order to create public discussion, to make the audience think\u201d.\nIn the Belarus Free Theatre model, art and activism are indivisible. Kaliada has proved adept at attracting high-profile patrons and supporters, including Tom Stoppard, in order to ensure the plight of her country and its citizens remains visible in the eyes of the west.\nBelarus is still somewhat simplistically described as \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictatorship\u201d, as if other countries weren\u2019t edging closer to that status. Alexander Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, and his presidency has been characterised by a climate of extreme political repression, enforced disappearances, systematic harassment of activists and independent media, a woeful track record on the human rights of disabled people, the LGBT and Roma communities. Belarus is also the only European country that still has the death penalty. A journalist before he was a playwright, Khalezin edited three newspapers until, one by one, they were closed by the government.\n\u201cPutin has a programme for the resurrection of the empire,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a new ideology which other countries gladly accept. Not a dictatorship but a monarchy without the monarch. Can you imagine a president being in power for 25 years in a normal society? It\u2019s a new type of monarchy. This is what many democratic leaders want. Boris Johnson would give his left arm to rule the country in the same way.\u201d\nOver the past 15 years, the company have addressed many of the issues facing Belarus, including the position of LGBT and disabled people in society. Kaliada believes that theatre can help bring about change but says: \u201cI also don\u2019t believe it is possible to change something with one performance,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to work from the grassroots to the top and in all possible directions, to make all layers of society talk to each other.\u201d\nThe position of artists in Belarus is slowly changing, explains Khalezin. Having been prohibited for 15 years, BFT were recently invited to participate at a national showcase. In the end, they performed in a garage, as they have in the past, because they would otherwise have been required to get the minister of culture\u2019s approval for their work. \u201cIt\u2019s the illusion of freedom,\u201d says Khalezin. \u201cBut it\u2019s still better than the situation where every week you have police. We\u2019re in a stage neither of war nor peace.\u201d\nWhen I went to Minsk to see the premiere of Dogs of Europe in March, the location of the performance was leaked, but this didn\u2019t seem to deter or worry people overly. What was most palpable was the exhilaration people felt in seeing this book, which intertwines the country\u2019s history, present and future, brought vividly to life, in a production staged with a characteristic combination of intense physicality and striking visual imagery \u2013 most notably a sequence in which books burst into flame, words burning.\nBacharevic\u2019s novel tells us, according to Khalezin, that \u201cin a dictatorship the authoritarian leader isn\u2019t guilty but all of us are\u201d. He regards it as \u201ca very powerful warning\u201d. He fears that the UK is in danger of heading in the same direction because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough strength to stop this process. There is not enough political will and not enough will in general.\u201d\nOver the last 10 years, Kaliada has seen the erosion in the UK of many human rights, freedoms of expression and internationalism, and she feels that they arrived here at the \u201clast moment when it was possible to touch what freedom is\u201d. Their work has often ended up feeling predictive, she says, citing Red Forest, their 2014 play about the global toll of environmental catastrophe that predated the refugee crisis. \u201cThe majority of critics in London said you don\u2019t understand anything, it won\u2019t happen here. But we spent time in a refugee camp talking to refugees about what was happening, and it was so clear to us.\u201d\nDogs of Europe was supposed to play at the Barbican in London in May but the performance has been cancelled because of the lockdown. In Belarus, very little has been cancelled. Lukashenko has been dismissive of what he calls \u201ccoronavirus psychosis\u201d, claiming the world has gone mad. The western coverage has chiefly focused on his statements about combating the virus with vodka and saunas, often treating it like a joke, seemingly oblivious to the fact that people will die as a result. While mass gatherings are banned in most countries, Lukashenko is building a 9,000-seat arena for a military parade due to take place in May. The KGB have been tasked with tracking down those \u201cspreading disinformation\u201d.\nThere\u2019s a dangerous tendency, Kaliada says, for the west to dismiss Lukashenko as a \u201cpolitical clown\u201d. The west does not understand what it is like to live in a dictatorship, she says. \u201cThis is a major threat to the population. He\u2019s using the same methods used during the time of Chernobyl. Mass disinformation. This is another way to kill his people.\u201d\n Belarus Free Theatre is making its archive available online each weekend for the next three months via its YouTube channel.",

At the end of the 14 days his wife, Li Wenzu, said Wang was still being barred from returning to Beijing, and was under strict supervision.\n\u201cI am most desperate to be reunited with my wife and son. Now Jinan [police] seem to want to restrict me from returning to Beijing,\u201d said Wang, who added that there is no legal basis for holding him in his home town but he was \u201ctrying his best\u201d to persuade the authorities to allow him home.\nThe US state department said: \u201cWe remain very concerned about reports of his declining physical and mental health, and of his mistreatment in prison.\n\u201cWang was detained as part of the PRC\u2019s [People\u2019s Republic of China] nationwide roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates beginning 9 July 2015.\n\u201cWe continue to call for the release of all of those unjustly detained, such as Li Yuhan and Yu Wensheng, as well as other Chinese citizens who are in detention simply for exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms in pursuit of a more equitable and just society, governed by the rule of law.\u201d\nIn his interview on Monday \u2013 the first time Wang has been heard publicly for five years \u2013 he confirmed speculation he had been detained the longest of all those caught up in the 2015 crackdown because he refused to confess.\n\u201cI never confessed, I would not compromise my principles,\u201d he said, adding that the authorities kept putting pressure on him between 2016 and 2018 to confess.\n\u201cI have no regrets,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything to boast about. I\u2019m not some sort of hero \u2026 I do what I am meant do as a lawyer.\u201d\nWhen the Guardian attempted to contact him, a male voice answered the call, saying he was not Wang. It appeared that Wang was back under police supervision.\nHis wife told the Guardian she could not go to Jinan because the authorities would likely put the whole family under strict surveillance for up to two years, as has happened to many human rights lawyers after their release from prison.\n\u201cWe have been apart for five years and I\u2019ve been anxious for five years. He needs a free environment and to be reunited with our son, to make up for all these years when he wasn\u2019t around,\u201d she said.\nThe US statement also expressed continued concern over China\u2019s \u201cweak rule of law\u201d, arbitrary detention and torture of detainees, and human rights violations.\nThe practice of releasing activists from prison into de facto house arrest or to their home town has been labelled \u201cnon-release release\u201d by rights groups.\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s China researcher, Yaqiu Wang, said the Chinese government seemed determined to silence Wang indefinitely, and called his continued detention \u201ca complete travesty of justice\u201d.",

This is Justine Landis-Hanley bringing you the main stories on Tuesday 21 April.\nThe national cabinet has agreed to lift some elective surgery restrictions after Anzac Day, Scott Morrison announced. The prime minister said state governments would ease restrictions on all category two or equivalent procedures in the private sector, as well as selected category three and other procedures. These include IVF, all screening programs, post-cancer reconstructive surgeries, all procedures for children under the age of 18, joint replacements and eye procedures.\nA year\u2019s worth of unemployment welfare applications have been processed in the last six weeks, Morrison announced on Tuesday. He said that since 16 March the government had processed 517,000 jobseeker claims.\nMeanwhile, the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 latest figures reveal almost 800,000 people \u2013 6% of the nation\u2019s workforce \u2013 lost their job in the first three weeks of coronavirus restrictions. The report, released on Tuesday, shows Australian workers have seen a 6.7% decline in take-home pay, with those under the age of 20 suffering the biggest losses in jobs and wages.\nReserve Bank governor Phillip Lowe has warned the Australian economy faces \u201cthe biggest contraction in national output\u201d since the Great Depression, with unemployment expected to hit 10% by June. Even if restrictions are eased this year, Lowe said it\u2019s likely unemployment will be around 6% or more for several years, and wage growth will stay below 2%.\nVirgin Australia has entered voluntary administration after failing to secure a government bailout to cope with the financial impact of coronavirus travel restrictions. Virgin appointed four Deloitte partners as joint administrators to deal with the company\u2019s $4.8bn pile of debt. The administrators said there were no plans to make any of the airline\u2019s 10,000 employees redundant during this administration period.\nChina has dismissed Australian foreign minister Marise Payne\u2019s call on Sunday for an international investigation into the origins and handing of coronavirus. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, accused Australia of \u201cdancing to the tune\u201d of the United States, adding that \u201cAustralian foreign minister Payne\u2019s remarks are not based on facts\u201d.\nNew South Wales school students will return to school one day a week starting 11 May, gradually increasing to full-time by term three, the state\u2019s premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced. The NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said the government wanted schools to have \u201cabout a quarter of students on campus each day, but how they break that group up will be a matter for [schools]\u201d.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nVirgin Australia: what does voluntary administration mean and how will it affect you?\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?\nAm I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

        "content": "A melancholic adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s novel about death in 70s suburbia remains a perfect marriage of style and substance\nAt the centre of The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola\u2019s dreamy yet devastating adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s acclaimed 1993 novel, is an unsolved mystery of the most troubling kind, a puzzle that will never be completed. The questions asked by those in the film, and by us the viewers, will never be fully answered. An attempt to figure out the hows and whys will only ever be that, an attempt. It\u2019s what\u2019s left behind when someone kills themselves, a fog of painful unsureness, a feeling that I filed away as other when I was 16, watching it for the first of many times. As is the case for many teens, the idea had briefly entered my mind at certain low points, but it still felt distant, like looking at something through a camera that isn\u2019t in focus.\nTwenty years later, my experience of suicide, and, in turn, the film itself, has changed. Last year, a family member and a close friend both killed themselves, in the space of about six months, forcing an otherworldly concept into grim reality, a difficult confrontation most of us don\u2019t expect to ever have. As I watched the film again, I found a new, deeper understanding of what Coppola herself described as \u201cthe extraordinary power of the unfathomable\u201d, of how not knowing the answer to a question of such staggering gravity can haunt you, a grip that may loosen over time but will remain nonetheless.\nIn an industry overrun with nepotism, there was every reason to wince at the film\u2019s arrival at Cannes in 1999 (a year before its release): the first film from Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s daughter, co-produced by him and starring actors he had worked with. The last we had seen of Sofia was in The Godfather Part III, disastrously miscast in what turned out to be a miserable experience for all of us, especially for her. It pushed her away from acting, something she was never that interested in anyway, and years later, with great help, she moved behind the camera, where she has remained ever since.\nShuddering memories of Boxing Helena (David Lynch\u2019s 19-year-old daughter Jennifer\u2019s laughable debut), Paris Can Wait (Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s wife Eleanor\u2019s indulgent and uninteresting attempt at directing) and pretty much anything written by John Landis\u2019s son Max have shown us the dangers of Hollywood over-assistance, a heavy-handed ushering of vanity projects that make it to the screen for all the wrong reasons, home movies that should have stayed at home. But with The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola emerged from her father\u2019s shadow with purpose, the work of a film-maker who wasn\u2019t just doing it because she could but rather because she should, an innate ability that would have pierced through with or without the help of an Oscar-winning parent.\nSet in 70s Michigan, in a suburbia that\u2019s both recognisably banal and at times ethereal, The Virgin Suicides opens with a suicide attempt. Cecilia Lisbon, the youngest daughter of five, has tried to kill herself, an act that leads to concern and confusion from those in the community. \u201cYou\u2019re not even old enough to know how bad life gets,\u201d she\u2019s ignorantly told. \u201cObviously, doctor, you\u2019ve never been a 13-year-old girl,\u201d she smartly replies. It\u2019s the beginning of the end, as told to us by an unseen narrator, the grownup version of a neighbourhood boy from the time, part of a quartet of curious locals whose obsession with the Lisbon girls has continued long after their deaths.\nCoppola keeps us at a distance from the sisters (played by Kirsten Dunst, AJ Cook, Leslie Hayman, Chelse Swain and Hanna R Hall), offering us brief anecdotes and scrappy clues so that we, like the boys, are left with only random pieces of the puzzle. The parents, played by Kathleen Turner and James Woods, are strict but not unloving, religious but not extremist, clueless but not in a way that isn\u2019t relatable and so while speculation from gossiping neighbours places responsibility for what happens solely at their feet, we know it\u2019s not that simple; it never is. The rush of unfamiliar, unwieldy emotions that come for us all during adolescence are too easily minimised by those who have already gone through it, as if the bigger picture they now see should be visible to all, and so, for me, at the core of the film is a collection of muffled screams. The first real scream we hear is when Cecilia kills herself, soon into the film, not long after her first attempt. We\u2019re shown how those who knew her and those who didn\u2019t all struggle with what to do, what to say, how to react, who to blame, an impossible situation that arrives without precedent.\nCoppola notably shows us no sign that the grief experienced by the surviving sisters is taken into account, is treated with the severity it deserves, and so life goes on as normal to those on the outside. But there\u2019s a wound that lingers. When the girls are forced to stay inside as punishment, after Dunst\u2019s Lux spends the night with a boy, Trip Fontaine (played by a 21-year-old Josh Hartnett at the height of his heartthrob years), we see the toll it starts to take. Their imprisonment is to them a clear sign that they\u2019re neither understood nor respected. \u201cWe\u2019re suffocating,\u201d Lux says to her mother in a telling fragment of a scene near the end. \u201cYou\u2019re safe here,\u201d she replies. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe in here,\u201d Lux answers.\nThe dreamy aesthetic and Air\u2019s transcendent, perfectly matched score led some to dismiss the film as a mere mood piece, of style over substance, but it\u2019s too grounded, too rich in detail to fall into that overused categorisation. We see that in a flash forward to an older Trip, whose teen bravado has faded into pathetic delusion, and we feel it in the finale as the boys discover the girls\u2019 bodies, while dreaming of the \u201cimpossible excursions\u201d they were planning to take. It remains Coppola\u2019s best film, in my opinion, because of this, because the emotions that accompany the atmosphere haunt with equal force.\nIt\u2019s as much about those who leave us as it is about those who are left behind, lumbered with what Coppola refers to as an \u201coddly shaped emptiness\u201d, a misty, unfocused form of grief that I now know firsthand. The final, mournful piece of narration expresses sadness over the loss but also a stinging sense of regret. If the boys had just called that little bit louder, if they had just arrived that little bit sooner, maybe things might have been different. They\u2019re agonising questions that we, as those who are still here, will always ask ourselves, knowing that the answers will for ever remain a mystery.\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email: jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "content": "Famed German beer festival usually attracts around 6 million visitors a year\nBavaria\u2019s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world\u2019s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus.\nThe 210-year-old festival, which attracts around 6 million visitors a year, is a major event in the German calendar.\nMarkus S\u00f6der, the premier of Bavaria, which has been one of the regions worst hit by the pandemic in Europe, said the Oktoberfest posed too big a public health risk. He had hinted over several weeks that it was \u201con the rocks\u201d and was unlikely to take place.\n\u201cLiving with coronavirus means living carefully,\u201d S\u00f6der said. \u201cAs long as there is no vaccination, we need to be very sensible. We are in mutual agreement that the risk is quite simply too high \u2026 compromises will not help.\u201d\nThe festival takes place in Munich, the Bavarian capital. Its mayor, Dieter Reiter, called the decision a \u201cbitter pill\u201d. He said that for businesses that take part in the festival it was a heavy financial blow, and in their interests it had been decided not to prolong announcing the move. \u201cBut one can simply not take a decision other than this,\u201d he said. The risk of festival goers, who sit packed closely together in large beer tents, infecting each other was high, Reiter said.\n\u201cThis is an emotional and economically difficult moment,\u201d he said. Revenue from the Oktoberfest last year amounted to around \u20ac1bn (\u00a3870m).\nSome areas in Germany have started to relax lockdown measures introduced last month to slow the spread of coronavirus, but big events are banned until 31 August. On Monday, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Germans to be disciplined to avoid a relapse after some improvement in the virus numbers.\nThe festival, also known colloquially as Die Wiesn or \u201cthe meadow\u201d was due to take place from 19 September to 4 October, attracting visitors from around the world. Some of the brewers who take part had suggested holding a \u201cWiesn Light\u201d \u2013 hosting it only for locals, but city authorities rejected the idea.\nThe Oktoberfest started in 1810 on 12 October, to celebrate the marriage of the crown prince of Bavaria to Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. It is the biggest annual tourist attraction in Germany.\nThousands of offshoot Oktoberfests take place around the world and are particularly popular in the United States.\nOn Tuesday morning, Bavaria had over 39,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 1,447 people had died of the disease.",

        "content": "Scientists surprised by latest results but say carbon cuts remain vital to prevent ice loss becoming permanent\nThe loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic is now very likely before 2050, new research shows, even if the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis are cut rapidly.\nThe result has alarmed scientists but they said slashing greenhouse gases remained vital as this would determine whether Arctic summer ice vanished permanently or could recover over time. If emissions remain very high, there is a risk the Arctic could be ice-free even in the dark, cold winter months, a possibility described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.\nThe last global scientific assessment of Arctic ice was in 2013. It predicted a complete loss of ice in the month of September, when it reaches its annual minimum, would occur only if CO2 emissions from human activities remained high. The new results are based on 40 of the latest computer models and is the best assessment to date of the fate of the Arctic ice.\nSince satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has lost 40% of its area and up to 70% of its volume, making it one of the clearest signs of human-caused global heating. In 2019, it shrank to its second lowest extent on record.\nThe loss of the ice exposes the dark ocean, which absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat and further ramps up temperatures. These changes are also being increasingly linked to more extreme weather including severe winters, deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods at lower latitudes such as in Europe and the US.\n\u201cAlarmingly the models repeatedly show the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean before 2050, almost irrespective of the measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change,\u201d said Ed Blockley, who leads the UK Met Office\u2019s polar climate programme and was one of the team behind the new research. \u201cThe signal is there in all possible futures. This was unexpected and is extremely worrying.\u201d\nProf Dirk Notz, at the University of Hamburg, Germany, coordinated the analysis and said: \u201cIf we keep global warming below 2C, Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050. This really surprised us.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the state-of-the-art in terms of sea ice simulations,\u201d said Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington, US, and not involved in the new study.\nThe new research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, uses the latest generation of climate models from 21 research institutes from around the world. In climate studies, the Arctic Ocean is said to be ice-free when it shrinks to fragments with a combined area below 1m sq km, which is 75% lower than in 2019.\nThe models are not perfect and struggle to match closely the ice loss and global warming seen in historical data. \u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Blockley said. \u201cBut all the models are clear that the sea ice will continue to decline. At some point, it will be gone, but when that happens is still uncertain.\u201d\nSea ice also varies naturally from year to year, making it hard to predict the date of the first ice-free summer. \u201cThere are some models [in which the summer Arctic] goes ice-free in the next few years,\u201d said Blockley. But he cautioned that these are considered outliers and that climate scientists use the combined set of models to calculate the likelihood of events.\nAnother surprising finding from the study is that an ice-free Arctic in the winter months appears possible if CO2 continues to be emitted at high levels. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen before in these projections,\u201d Blockley said. \u201cA winter ice-free event would be catastrophic, for some wildlife species [like polar bears] for example, that live and hunt around the sea ice.\u201d\nWagner said the loss of Arctic sea ice could have far-reaching consequences, from increasing global heating to harming wildlife: \u201cIt also opens up a new ocean for human exploration, from oil and gas extraction, to increased shipping, to increased tourism, each with their own perils and benefits.\u201d\nProf James Screen, at the University of Exeter, UK, said: \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that although we might see an ice-free Arctic in all scenarios by 2050, the expected frequency of ice-free summers differs between scenarios. Under a higher emissions scenarios there may be ice-free summers every year, but in lower emissions scenarios they might be occasional.\u201d\nBlockley said the new research showed cutting carbon emissions remained vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic, adding: \u201cWe are showing there is still hope.\u201d",

Secondly, even for those who do qualify on that basis, there\u2019s no legal backing for those protections without a statutory instrument at the very least, so they could find themselves inadvertently in good faith having accepted that extension when in fact they have no legal basis still to be here after their visa expires.\n\u201cAnd thirdly no formal instructions have been issued by the Home Office to professionals and others dealing in this field to say exactly what the situation is.\u201d\nBerry replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a good summary.\u201d",

It is those limits that France wants lifted, France\u2019s digital minister, C\u00e9dric O, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking Apple to lift the technical hurdle to allow us to develop a sovereign European health solution that will be tied our health system,\u201d O said.\nContact tracing apps that do not conform to the new privacy requirements can still be built, but they face strict limits, particularly on Apple phones. They don\u2019t work when \u201cbackgrounded\u201d, as when another app or game is in use on the phone, nor when the screen is locked entirely.\nSome countries have forged ahead despite the limitations, such as Singapore\u2019s TraceTogether contact tracing app. Others, including the UK, have privately expressed concern, while maintaining amicable relations with the two tech firms publicly.\nThe French intervention could encourage others to bring their disputes into the open, however. At the heart of the criticism is the question of who has the power to decide the best balance between user privacy and contact tracing efficacy: technology companies or public health bodies.\nFrance wants to deploy its app by 11 May, without using the special measures Apple and Google have put in place, which are targeted for release in mid-May. That means the country will be forced to use the more limited features already built into iOS, unless Apple changes its policies and allows for far more invasive use of the Bluetooth radio at the heart of its devices.\nFor the two technology companies, there is a second set of tradeoffs: any tools they offer to one government must be offered to every government. That is why they seek to maintain a high level of privacy across the board and not offer opt-outs.\nAs well as preventing excess data from being sent back to public health authorities, the forthcoming tools will have other constraints. Apple and Google say they will maintain the ability to disable them on a regional basis once the current crisis is over, and they will refuse to authorise any government which seeks to make installing the apps compulsory.\nTheir approach was supported on Monday by a letter from nearly 300 privacy experts, who warned that contact tracing apps \u201ccan otherwise be repurposed to enable unwarranted discrimination and surveillance\u201d.\n\u201cWe urge all countries to rely only on systems that are subject to public scrutiny and that are privacy preserving by design (instead of there being an expectation that they will be managed by a trustworthy party), as a means to ensure that the citizen\u2019s data protection rights are upheld,\u201d the letter said.",

        "content": "Far right activist in libel case over videos made after Jamal Hijazi was assaulted at school\nOnline comments made by the far right activist Tommy Robinson about a Syrian teenager amounted to accusations that the young refugee had \u201cparticipated in a violent assault on a young girl\u201d and \u201cthreatened to stab another child\u201d, a judge has ruled.\nIn an interim ruling on a high-profile libel case, Mr Justice Nicklin said the \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning\u201d of the two Robinson videos, which have been viewed more than 900,000 times, related to a \u201cspecific allegation of violent conduct\u201d.\nThe claim follows an incident in November 2018 when Jamal Hijazi, then 16, was pushed to the ground and threatened with drowning at Almondbury Community school in Huddersfield.\nFootage of the refugee student being pushed to the ground and having water poured on his face was watched millions of times, provoking outrage and a flood of public sympathy.\nRobinson, 37, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, then posted two videos on Facebook claiming Jamal was \u201cnot innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school\u201d.\nA full hearing of the libel case has yet to be scheduled. In his preliminary decision on Tuesday, the judge ruled that the accusations in the videos meant Jamal had \u201cas part of a gang, participated in a violent assault on a young girl which had caused her significant injuries and threatened to stab another child\u201d.\nJamal\u2019s lawyers say the allegations are \u201cvery seriously defamatory\u201d. Mr Justice Nicklin, however, rejected their contention that Robinson\u2018s statements would be understood to suggest there were other \u201cincidents of violence beyond the particular acts that were identified\u201d in the videos.\n\u201cThe viewer would recognise that the defendant was making a specific allegation of violent conduct against the claimant,\u201d the judge said.\nNicklin said the ordinary and reasonable viewer of the videos would understand Robinson to have been speaking figuratively when he said Jamal was \u201cnot innocent, he attacks young girls\u201d.\nThe judge also rejected Robinson\u2019s suggested meaning of the statements, that \u201cas part of a gang, the claimant has committed serious acts of violence against a schoolgirl\u201d.\nNicklin ruled that Robinson\u2019s suggested meaning \u201cfails to capture the gravity of the allegation being made against the claimant, specifically that [the girl] had been beaten \u2018black and blue\u2019 ... and ignores, completely, the allegation of a threat to stab the boy that is made clearly in the first video\u201d.\nIn his ruling, Nicklin stated: \u201cIt is important to note that the court is only dealing with the issue of meaning. The defendant has advanced a defence of truth. Unless the parties resolve the litigation, that issue [and others] will be determined at a later trial.\u201d\nAt a previous hearing last November, William Bennett QC, for Robinson, said his defence would focus on \u201cthose people who say they were assaulted by the claimant and the claimant\u2019s denials that he assaulted them\u201d.",

        "content": "The Accrington Stanley midfielder Sam Finley has been handed an eight-match ban for calling the Republic of Ireland international Paul McShane a \u201cpikey\u201d.\nFinley was charged with an aggravated breach of the Football Association\u2019s rules after a League One game against McShane\u2019s Rochdale in January. An independent regulatory commission has found the comment was a slur based on the Wicklow-born defender\u2019s nationality and as well as the suspension fined Finley \u00a3850 and ordered him to attend an FA education course.\nThe midfielder could have been hit with an 11-match suspension for a second aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 (1), having made reference to the sexual orientation of a match referee in 2016. But the commission considered the insult referred to McShane\u2019s nationality only and did not treat it as an ethnic slur. That view, along with Finley\u2019s eventual admission of guilt, resulted in the lesser sanction.\nFinley initially denied calling the former Sunderland, Hull and Reading defender a \u201cpikey\u201d after McShane told the referee, Tom Nield, he was racially abused during the game on New Year\u2019s Day. After the match the 27-year-old told Nield that he had called McShane \u201ca prick\u201d and when interviewed by the FA on 15 January claimed to have said: \u201cfuck off back to your caravan you prick.\u201d The midfielder eventually admitted the breach when charged on 26 February.\nIn the written reasons for its decision, the commission says: \u201cThe participant (Finley) had nationality in mind since in his witness statement he says \u2018I did make reference that Paul should go back to his caravan and that I was referencing his being Irish in doing so\u2019.\u201d It adds: \u201cNevertheless, the word \u2018pikey\u2019 implied more insult than being implicitly called merely \u2018Irish\u2019. \u2018Pikey\u2019 has well-known disparaging connotations associated with the term and is therefore commonly considered a slur.\u201d\nFinley\u2019s suspension is with immediate effect until Accrington have completed eight matches. The Liverpool-born player, who was released by Everton when he was 16, is permitted to appeal.",

I didn\u2019t see any of these. But while my classmates were wearing their hair like Olivia Hussey in Romeo and Juliet, or trilling earworms from Oliver! during lunch break, my young imagination was gripped by the vision of a cartoon Russian bear roughing up a hapless Turkey as ominous music rumbled on the soundtrack.\nBeguiled by the clip when it played on TV, I badgered my father into taking me to see the film in which it featured: Tony Richardson\u2019s The Charge of the Light Brigade. I knew it wasn\u2019t all cartoon because it had David Hemmings in it and, though I was too young to have seen Blow-Up, the film that put him on the map, his picture was in all the magazines and I had a massive crush. Hemmings, sporting one of those dashing moustaches that were all the rage post-Sergeant Pepper, was playing Captain Nolan, and the poster showed him leading the charge.\nThe animated credit sequence (by the brilliant Richard Williams) proceeds to show the English lion letting out a mighty roar (a parody of the MGM studio ident) and putting on a policeman\u2019s helmet, ready to restore order to the world, followed by an animated digest of the Industrial Revolution, with the British empire at its hub. Over the next two and a half hours, these Punch-inspired animations recur at intervals to provide ironic state-of-the-nation commentary (and fill in scenes too expensive to shoot as live action). The film takes a satirical scalpel to Victorian sociopolitical and military structures, fleshed out by a Who\u2019s Who of Great British Acting led by Trevor Howard, at the top of his game as Lord Cardigan, John Gielgud as Lord Raglan, and Vanessa Redgrave, four inches taller than Hemmings, as Nolan\u2019s love interest. It culminates, of course, in one of the most notorious military blunders in history.\nI knew it would end in tears \u2013 I\u2019d read Lord Tennyson\u2019s poem \u2013 but confidently expected Nolan to emerge from the disaster, moustache slightly ruffled, to return to his beloved Clarissa. But oh no! For not only does Captain Nolan get hit by a piece of shrapnel before the charge has even properly begun \u2013 he is one of the reasons it all goes so horribly wrong! That heroic stance on the poster? It\u2019s Nolan \u201cscreaming like a woman\u201d (Lord Cardigan\u2019s words) as he dies.\nTramautised yet thrilled by my first grown-up taste of things ending badly, I rushed out and read everything I could find about the Crimean war, including the screenplay\u2019s source material, Cecil Woodham-Smith\u2019s The Reason Why. It sparked in me an appetite for military history and big battle movies that persists to this day. Wikipedia says the film\u2019s reception was \u201cgenerally positive\u201d but I remember it as negative, exacerbated by the director\u2019s refusal to screen it for the critics and a perception in conservative quarters that it cleaved to modish anti-war sentiments. Monthly Film Bulletin called it \u201ca well-nigh intolerable mess\u201d.\nYet none of Richardson\u2019s other films ever quickened my pulse like this one, and only recently did it strike me that The Charge of the Light Brigade\u2019s presiding genius was not its director but its writer: Charles Wood, the great but undervalued playwright and screenwriter who died in February. Wood gave John Osborne\u2019s earlier draft a fleet-footed satirical makeover that renders the dialogue eccentric, hilarious, authentically Victorian-sounding and a constant delight to the ear. \u201cNo damn business of anyone what is what. I am Lord Cardigan. That is what.\u201d\nOver half a century later, the film looks better than ever. Part of its timelessness is due to the absence of the 1960s makeup and hairstyling that have so dated other epics of the era (though Nolan\u2019s hussar jacket found its way on to Jimi Hendrix, and then Adam Ant). And The Charge of the Light Brigade\u2019s themes couldn\u2019t be more pertinent in a nation still hobbled by class differences, jingoistic nostalgia and predilection for glorious self-harm.",

        "content": "Lawyers argue that ministers have failed to account for UK\u2019s climate crisis obligations\nCampaigners have launched a legal challenge to try to prevent billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money being spent on a huge road-building programme, which they say breaches the UK\u2019s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution.\nLawyers acting for the Transport Action Network (Tan) have begun legal proceedings against the Department for Transport calling for the road-building scheme, which was confirmed last month by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to be suspended.\nThey argue that ministers did not take into account the government\u2019s legally binding commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. They also say the government has not considered whether the \u00a327bn programme is in line with its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.\nThe move follows a successful challenge to the proposed third runway at Heathrow. In that case the court ruled that the planned airport expansion was illegal because ministers did not adequately take into account the government\u2019s commitments to tackle the climate crisis.\nThe road-building programme is thought to be the UK\u2019s largest and would lead to thousands of miles of new roads being built across the country in the coming years \u2013 with at least 50 projects due to be under way in the next two years.\nThe UK\u2019s road network and its wider transport infrastructure are crucial in the country\u2019s efforts to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The transport sector is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and the only one to have increased its emissions in recent years.\nChris Todd, Tan\u2019s director, said it was impossible to take the government seriously on the threat posed by climate change when it is \u201cset to burn billions on the largest ever roads programme\u201d.\n\u201cThis massive roads programme has become like a juggernaut that\u2019s out of control, that no one can stop. We now have no choice but to go to court to prevent an unfolding disaster.\u201d\nTan wrote to the secretary of state following the court of appeal\u2019s Heathrow decision in February requesting a pause in the road-building programme to allow time to reconsider its environmental effects. It said it did not receive a response to that letter. Lawyers have sent a pre-action protocol letter that is the official start of legal proceedings.\nRowan Smith, from the solicitors Leigh Day, which is pursuing the case on behalf of Tan, said the group was raising \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d at a time when it was widely established that the climate emergency \u201cdemands a move away from a continued reliance on fossil fuels towards more sustainable transport\u201d.\nThe government\u2019s climate change adviser has joined calls for ministers to reconsider its road-building plans.\nChris Stark, the head of the Committee on Climate Change, said it would be better for the economy and the fight against climate breakdown for the billions of pounds allocated for road-building to be invested in broadband \u2013 especially in light of the coronavirus crisis, which has led to many more people working from home.\n\u201cThe government mustn\u2019t be investing in anything likely to increase carbon emissions,\u201d Stark told the BBC. \u201cI expect that video-conferencing will become the new normal and we won\u2019t return to travelling the way we did. I would spend the roads budget on fibre. You would get a huge return to the economy with people having better connections. You would save people\u2019s time and increase their productivity.\u201d\nHis comments echo those of the head of the motoring organisation the AA, who said this month that government money would be better invested in broadband than roads.\nIn response to the legal challenge, a spokesperson for the Department for Transport defended its plans. \u201cThe second road investment strategy is consistent with our ambitions to improve air quality and decarbonise transport,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have received the letter and will respond formally in due course.\u2019\u2019",

        "content": "Experts say a link is plausible as dirty air is known to harm lungs, but more research is needed\nA preliminary study has found the first evidence of a link between higher levels of air pollution and deaths from Covid-19 in England.\nThe analysis showed London, the Midlands and the north-west had the highest levels of nitrogen oxides and higher numbers of coronavirus deaths.\nThe research has not yet been peer-reviewed and shows only a correlation. The scientists behind the study said more research was needed to confirm a causal link and rule out other possible factors such as income levels and any difference in age profiles in the regions.\nBut they said there was an urgent need to share information about the pandemic. Previous research showed air pollution increased deaths during the Sars outbreak in 2003, and long-term exposure to dirty air is well known to damage lung health.\n\u201cOur study adds to growing evidence from northern Italy and the US that high levels of air pollution are linked to deadlier cases of Covid-19,\u201d said Miguel Martins, of the University of Cambridge, who led the new analysis.\n\u201cThis is something we saw during the Sars outbreak back in 2003, where long-term exposure to air pollutants had a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients in China. This highlights the importance of reducing air pollution for the protection of human health, both in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.\u201d\nResearch published on Monday found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all Covid-19 deaths in the 66 regions. Another recent study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates.\nExperts say the idea that air pollution may increase susceptibility to Covid-19 is plausible, but they warn that early studies must be treated very carefully.\n\u201cAs epidemiologists we are very cautious about interpreting studies, as we have learned even in high-quality studies about hidden biases and simple random variability,\u201d said Prof Mark Goldberg, of McGill University in Canada. \u201cWhen we try to assess causality, especially in non-randomised studies, we need about 20-30 really good studies.\u201d\nPeople over the age of 60 or with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease are thought to be at the highest risk of severe symptoms or death from Covid-19.\nIn the new study, the scientists write: \u201cLong-term exposure to air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides from car exhaust fumes or burning fossil fuels, is a known risk factor for these health conditions.\u201d\nThe analysis showed a correlation between air pollution levels recorded in 2018 and 2019 and data on deaths reported in England up to 8 April. \u201cFuture and more detailed studies may further elucidate these observations by addressing potential confounders, including socioeconomic status, comorbidities, age, race and differences between regional health regulations and their intensive care unit capacities,\u201d the scientists said.\nThe study also notes that the severity of another lung infection, called respiratory syncytial virus, is known to be directly linked to variations in nitrogen oxide levels.\nProf Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London, said it was important to note that the study was not peer-reviewed. \u201cBut these provisional results are compatible with recently published studies and confirm what we already know \u2013 that air pollution has many adverse effects on human health. We must therefore now plan to prevent a bounceback in traffic emissions after the lockdown has ended.\u201d\nWidespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.",

The Royal Airforce posted images from royal visits over the years, including one of the Red Arrows flying over the Royal Standard.\nBoris Johnson\u2019s official Twitter account posted a congratulatory message \u201cWishing Her Majesty The Queen a very happy birthday!\u201d.\n  Trooping the Colour, the military ceremony held on her official birthday in June has been cancelled, with no alternative plans announced.",

Now it will get a surname as the club seek a sponsor for 2020-21 \u2013 a first step towards the sale of the naming rights as construction begins on a new 105,000-capacity stadium which they hope to have completed on the same site within four years.

        "content": "Tomatina food fight also in jeopardy as physical distancing hits Spain\u2019s tourism industry\nThe festival of San Ferm\u00edn, which for centuries has unleashed half-tonne fighting bulls into the narrow streets of Pamplona, has been suspended indefinitely as Spain battles one of the world\u2019s deadliest outbreaks of Covid-19.\n\u201cAs expected as it was, it still leaves us deeply sad,\u201d said Ana Elizalde, the acting mayor of Pamplona. \u201cAs of today, it seems unlikely that the festival will be celebrated this year, but let\u2019s wait and see how the events evolve.\u201d\nSpain has recorded more than 21,000 deaths from coronavirus and more than 200,000 confirmed cases of infection. In the northern region of Navarra, which includes Pamplona, more than 350 people have been killed by the virus.\n\u201cIn this context, there\u2019s no place for fireworks, bullfights or bull runs,\u201d said Elizalde.\nThe fiesta, long a target for animal rights activists, has been called off only a handful of times in the past century, for reasons such as civil war or other political unrest. It typically draws around a million visitors for nine days of alcohol-fuelled partying.\n\u201cIt seems our beloved fiesta is at odds with the coronavirus,\u201d Elizalde said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to wear masks, keep a social distance \u2013 measures that are incompatible with what San Ferm\u00edn is.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a calculation that is playing out across the country as officials attempt to maintain physical distancing. Adding to the pressure is the outsized role that tourism plays in the Spanish economy: more than 83 million people visited Spain last year, accounting for nearly 12% of the country\u2019s GDP.\nIn the small town of Bu\u00f1ol, near Valencia, the mayor and town councillors will meet on Monday to debate what lies ahead for the world\u2019s largest food fight. Held each year in August, the Tomatina usually crams 20,000 people into the town to pelt each other with thousands of ripe tomatoes.\nIn the heart of the Rioja wine region \u2013 where the coronavirus outbreak has taken a particularly deadly toll \u2013 June usually heralds Haro\u2019s wine battle, in which participants drench each other in 70,000 litres of red wine.\nThe rapidly changing situation in Spain has left little room for concrete estimates on when tourism might return to normal. \u201cOur country will not start tourist activity until it is extraordinarily safe, both for those who live in Spain and who come to visit,\u201d the government spokesperson Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero said last week.\nThe government imposed strict lockdown measures in mid-March, and closed land borders to all but Spanish citizens and residents soon after.\nThe labour minister, Yolanda D\u00edaz, recently suggested the tourism, culture and leisure sectors would not restart until after the summer and could expect to face \u201cenormous difficulty\u201d.\nThe tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, hinted that jam-packed festivals, beaches and plazas would not be seen anytime soon. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine, nothing will be the way it was before. Gatherings will have to be limited to maintain safe distances,\u201d she told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\n\u201cIt is very important that we continue to follow health recommendations,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to keep up what we are doing now; washing our hands, keeping social distance \u2026 even on the beach.\u201d",

So it means that if social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over.\u201d\nIata said domestic air traffic had slumped 70% since early January because of the pandemic and warned that any global recovery was likely to be slow. While domestic routes will open sooner than long-haul, weak consumer confidence amid recession fears will undermine a quick recovery, said Brian Pearce, Iata\u2019s chief economist. Vietnam plans to restart all domestic flights from Thursday.\nPearce pointed to China, where air travel bounced back initially when domestic flights resumed in mid-February, but said the recovery had since stalled with the number of domestic flights at just over 40% of pre-pandemic levels. In Australia, domestic flights are 10% of pre-crisis levels even though new Covid-19 infections are close to zero.\nIata is conducting regional summits with governments this week and called for confidence-boosting measures. While several European countries are starting to ease national lockdowns, \u201can immediate rebound from the catastrophic fall in passenger demand appears unlikely\u201d, said de Juniac.\nThe aviation body expects 2020 global passenger revenues to more than halve from last year, a loss of $314bn (\u00a3255bn).",

Indeed, those close to the deal believe the takeover is now unstoppable.\nNonetheless, Amnesty UK\u2019s director, Kate Allen, has written to Richard Masters, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, to warn him his organisation\u2019s credibility will be threatened should he rubber-stamp a buyout that can be interpreted as a shameless exercise in soft geopolitical power.\nAllen wrote: \u201cSo long as these questions [concerning Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record] remain unaddressed, the Premier League is putting itself at risk of becoming a patsy of those who want to use the glamour and prestige of Premier League football to cover up actions that are deeply immoral, in breach of international law and at odds with the values of the Premier League and the global footballing community.\u201d wrote Allen.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record has been widely condemned, with Amnesty highlighting the imprisonment and torture of government critics and the execution of others following unfair trials.\nAllen fears the coronavirus emergency will dictate that Newcastle\u2019s takeover receives significantly reduced scrutiny. In a statement separate to the letter sent to Masters, she said: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis has already thrown a spotlight on football and its need to treat players and staff fairly, and now there\u2019s a danger that the pandemic could obscure the need for a cool, measured and genuinely ethical decision over this deal.\n\u201cAll businesses need to safeguard against any possible links to human rights violations, and English football is no different. This is more than just a financial transaction \u2013 it\u2019s an image-building exercise that draws on the prestige of the Premier League and the passion of Newcastle United\u2019s fanbase.\n\u201cWhether or not this deal goes ahead, we\u2019re calling on Newcastle United staff and fans to familiarise themselves with the dire human rights situation in Saudi Arabia and be prepared to speak out about it.\n\u201cAt the very least, the Premier League should make a clear statement over how its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test has been applied in this case, and what assessment has been made of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record under Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s leadership.\u201d\nNeither Newcastle or the Premier League will comment on the takeover but Masters was asked about a potential Saudi buyout in February. \u201cThe owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test is about as private and confidential a test as it comes, so it is impossible for me to comment on what the conclusions of the Premier League board would be in such a scenario,\u201d he said at the time.\n\u201cThere are a set of objective tests which are financially related and there are also tests \u2013 and again, I am not linking this with anybody \u2013 about crimes committed overseas or activities which might be seen as criminal in this country might be taken into account.\u201d\nNewcastle supporters are almost universally delighted at the prospect of seeing the back of the unpopular Ashley and, albeit with certain caveats, the new owners can expect a warm welcome on Tyneside where they are understood to be committed to hefty investment in both the playing squad and urban regeneration projects.\nThe Premier League checks are expected to be completed within the next fortnight.",

        "content": "A week in a Coventry hospital documenting the work of NHS staff brought the human dimensions of this crisis home to me\nLike many people around the country, I stand on my front doorstep at 8pm every Thursday to clap for carers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet when I did so for the first time last month, not knowing for sure if my neighbours would join me, I realised I knew little of the people for whom I was clapping.\nWho are the nurses, doctors, cleaners, clerks, porters, researchers and consultants on whom so many lives depend?\nAnd what are their stories?\n  I was born at Walsgrave hospital in Coventry on 15 August 1982, so it felt appropriate that I should visit its modern counterpart, University Hospital (UHCW), to document the stories of everyday heroism within.\nMy first day on site began with a shave. I had to be \u201cfit-tested\u201d for an FFP3 mask \u2013 a form of personal protective equipment used in critical care \u2013 but beards are strictly prohibited because they prevent a tight seal. Two blunted razors later, I donned my mask and a nurse squirted a liquid into my face. \u201cCan you taste doughnuts?\u201d she asked. I couldn\u2019t, which meant my mask was tight.\nI felt guilty for receiving precious PPE, but was told that the hospital had ample resources, thanks to diligent planning and that the healthcare staff wanted their stories to be heard.\nAs I walked through the corridors and into the less contagious wards, initially wearing only a basic surgical mask, the hospital was so quiet that it hardly felt like a pandemic at all. I had expected alarm bells, doctors in hazmat suits pinging from bed to bed, and the sound of patients struggling to breathe. Instead, I passed rows of empty beds \u2013 entire wards on standby \u2013 and nurses in minimal PPE calmly proceeding with their rounds.\n I glimpsed some patients, though many were tucked away in private rooms or dorms. Most looked exhausted. I asked one man for permission to photograph his legs through a window as he texted loved ones. He agreed. As I peered through the lens and into his room, it was no longer the quietness that struck me \u2013 it was the sense of isolation. Like all Covid-19 patients, this man was physically separated from his friends and family.\nThe following day I met a recovering Covid-19 patient who was soon to be discharged. His laboured speech and weakened body illustrated the sheer destructiveness of the virus. It was also my first experience of wearing additional PPE \u2013 latex gloves, a visor and a flimsy apron. By the time my five-minute interview was done, I was sweating profusely and could hardly concentrate on the multiple rounds of handwashing required before I could leave the room.\nI learned more about the hospital, the treatments patients were receiving and the symptoms most were experiencing. More importantly, I learned about individual members of staff, their skills, their personal lives and their sense of duty.\nMost were working voluntary overtime, many had family and children at home, some were scared for their safety. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a naturally caring person,\u201d one told me. All 9,000 employees could easily have said the same.\nOne interview in particular, with bioscientist Ranveer Singh Chaven, was particularly poignant. He spoke of his desire to hug his mother again.\n Thankfully, and somewhat surprisingly, there was plenty of light relief throughout the hospital. I spotted Stacey Gavin in the medical decisions unit. She was wearing a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash, and struck a pose momentarily as I turned around with my camera. In times of stress and distress, it seems a smile is one of the most valuable things you can bring to a hospital. \n It wasn\u2019t until my last day at the hospital that I was taken into the intensive therapy unit, where the sickest patients are kept on life support. I knew my experience and perception of the NHS would be forever altered by what I would witness in ITU. I also knew I had a duty to photograph it honestly and respectfully.\nThe patients I saw were almost all sedated. They were profoundly ill, immobilised by organ failure, and I knew some would not survive the week. One wore a breathing apparatus which covered his entire head. It was a sight I will not forget. Yet there was a sense, even in ITU, of calm and control among the medical staff. They were providing dutiful care to every patient in their hour of need.\nI looked around the ward with a sense of admiration. Many of the medics were my age or younger. I thought to myself: here they are, the subjects of my applause.\n Jonny Weeks is a photojournalist and picture editor",

        "content": "Old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper enough to help reduce spread of coronavirus\nThe public should wear homemade masks when they venture outdoors to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, according to scientists who claim Britain\u2019s masks policy does too little to prevent infections.\nProf Sian Griffiths, who led the Hong Kong government\u2019s investigation into the 2003 Sars epidemic, said Britain should adopt the same approach as the US, where people are advised to make their own \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d and wear them in public spaces.\nTrish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University who recently completed a review on face masks, also advocated the use of masks in public and suggested an old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper would suffice.\nThe US policy is being directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is designed to reduce at least some transmission of the virus while preventing a run on medical-grade masks needed by frontline health workers.\n\u201cThe CDC advice in the US is pragmatic,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cIt recognises both the need to ensure the supply of masks for clinical situations where they are obviously needed at the same time as recognising that there could potentially be benefits in wearing \u2018masks\u2019 in public to prevent passing on the infection.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) met on Tuesday to review the evidence on wearing face masks. The Guardian understands that the group is split on the best policy to adopt because the evidence is so weak.\nMinisters are deeply reluctant to recommend the use of even homemade masks amid concerns that people will rush to buy medical masks and leave the NHS facing even greater supply shortages.\nAsked about potential changes to the advice on the face masks, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said at the daily No 10 press conference that ministers would be \u201cguided by the science as always\u201d.\nSpeaking at the briefing, Professor Jonathan Van-Tham, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, said advice from Sage would be passed on to ministers. But he stressed there was \u201can absolute enduring principle\u201d not to jeopardise supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health and social care workers, adding: \u201cthat is a line that we are not going to cross under any circumstances.\u201d\nPublic Health England recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that while masks can help prevent people from passing on coronavirus, they are inadequate protection on their own from contracting it.\nGreenhalgh, on the back of a review on face masks, said homemade versions could dramatically reduce the amount of droplets sprayed from people\u2019s mouths, which can carry the virus if the person is infected.\n\u201cWe should be covering our faces with homespun materials like cotton. Medical-grade masks are scratchy and uncomfortable. Your old T-shirt is soft and nice, and with a couple of layers of kitchen paper inside a double layer, it will reduce the droplets coming out of your mouth and nose by about 95%,\u201d she said.\nShe added: \u201cThe public should not and must not divert medical-grade supplies.\u201d\nThere is growing unease over the government\u2019s reluctance to recommend the use of face masks. Doctors across the UK have now backed the Masks4AllUK movement, which argues that people should wear homemade masks when they go out.\nAt a press conference on Friday, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that while Sage would look at the evidence, it was \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d that masks were available in hospitals and other high-risk transmission areas.\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England, said the impact on the NHS must be fully assessed. \u201cFluid-repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSecuring the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration for government. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.\u201d\nProf David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chairs an independent advisory group to the WHO emergencies programme that is managing the Covid-19 pandemic, said the purpose of wearing face masks was to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus if they were infected themselves.\n\u201cMasks should not be worn by the general public to protect themselves as there is evidence that masks do not prevent infection by other respiratory infections such as flu,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe best way that the general public can support government policy is to understand how to protect themselves and protect others if they are sick or believe they may be infected.

        "content": "Francis Kean, the chairman of the Fiji Rugby Union and a key supporter of Bill Beaumont\u2019s bid for re-election as World Rugby\u2019s chairman, has stood down from the global governing body\u2019s council amid allegations of homophobia and discrimination.\nKean has also been removed from standing in the forthcoming elections for a place on World Rugby\u2019s executive committee. It is understood the ruling body and Beaumont put considerable pressure on the FRU to act after mounting allegations against Kean, who was also convicted of manslaughter in 2007.\nA report in the Sunday Times featuring allegations of homophobia was followed by a damning letter sent to World Rugby by Dan Leo, chief executive of Pacific Rugby Players Welfare, which included a litany of claims about Kean. Two Amnesty International reports have also condemned Kean, who was put in charge of the Fiji prison service in 2016, and the environment surrounding him.\nWorld Rugby had pledged to investigate the allegations of homophobia against Kean as they contravened the governing body\u2019s code of conduct, but initially said it cannot influence who the FRU selects as its representative for the council. Sufficient pressure has been put on the FRU, however, to ensure Kean has been stood down. The FRU\u2019s chief executive, John O\u2019Connor, has replaced him on World Rugby\u2019s council.\n\u201cWorld Rugby takes all allegations of behaviour that is not in keeping with the sport\u2019s strong and inclusive values and bylaws extremely seriously,\u201d read a statement. \u201cWhile it is important to stress that any allegations must be validated, following dialogue with World Rugby, the Fiji Rugby Union recognises the seriousness of the allegations made and the need for them to be fully investigated, and that it is in the best interests of the sport that Mr Kean steps down from the council and his executive committee candidature be withdrawn.\u201d\nKean\u2019s resignation eases the pressure on Beaumont but his bid for re-election is still likely to be tarnished. His nomination was seconded by the FRU and while he would insist it came from the union rather than Kean, many will consider that to be splitting hairs.\nKean, furthermore, who is the brother-in-law of Fiji\u2019s prime minister, was backed in his attempt to join the executive committee by the French federation\u2019s president, Bernard Laporte, who is running to be Beaumont\u2019s vice-chairman.\nVoting in the election for the chairmanship \u2013 in which the former Argentina captain Agust\u00edn Pichot is also running \u2013 as well as the executive committee, begins next week but the results will not be announced until 12 May.\nA key part of Beaumont\u2019s manifesto is an overhaul of World Rugby\u2019s governance, including the introduction of a fit-and-proper persons test which Kean would have fallen foul of before his nomination.\nIn his open letter Leo wrote: \u201cIf the values of World Rugby really are integrity, respect, solidarity, passion and discipline, all of this \u2013 and the claim to have been building character since 1823 \u2013 will be utterly debased if Kean is elected to the [executive committee].\u201d",

The number of people who died in private homes also more than tripled, to 466.\nBut the latest assessment of the virus\u2019s impact on the most vulnerable by the Office of National Statistics, released on Tuesday, remains far short of the care sector\u2019s own warnings that many thousands more have already died.\nAmid growing concern that figures underestimating the scale of the crisis in care settings may have slowed down the UK government\u2019s response, the Department of Health and Social Care said it was trying to speed up data collection and close the 10-day time-lag in data collection.\nFigures gathered from care homes by the Guardian this week show the actual death toll is considerably higher. Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of industry group Care England, said on Tuesday that the number of fatalities in care \u201ccould easily exceed what\u2019s [happening] in hospitals\u201d where 17,337 people have already died. He has estimated that at least 7,500 people have already died in care homes.\nThe far lower official figures rely on death certificates, which can take 11 days to process and may not always include Covid-19 as a cause of death, sometimes including deaths from flu, pneumonia or other underlying causes.\nBy Monday, five of the largest care home providers had recorded 1,052 deaths from confirmed or suspected Covid-19, with the death toll rising sharply in recent days. HC-One, the UK\u2019s largest operator, said on Tuesday it had lost 498 people across 120 of its homes and that modelling partly based on death rates in Italy and Spain suggested it could lose up to 135 further residents to Covid-19 people in the next 10 days.\nCare UK, which runs 122 homes in England and Scotland, recorded 140 deaths, a 65% increase, in four days, while Four Seasons Health Care reported more than 160 deaths in 190 care homes \u2013 a 60% increase in six days.\nThe latest ONS figures show that of 9,869 Covid-19 deaths to 10 April, less than 11% happened in care homes. By contrast, official figures from Scotland up to 12 April show one in four deaths are recorded in care homes. In Scotland, there were 237 deaths in care compared with 596 in hospitals and 128 at homes and in other non-institutional places, according to the National Records of Scotland.\nMeanwhile, Covid-19 has pushed the overall weekly death toll for England and Wales to a record high for the second week running. For the week to Good Friday (10 April), there were 18,516 deaths, the highest number since weekly data was first gathered in 2000. Just over a third of all deaths were attributed to Covid-19 \u2013 rising to more than half in London and 37% in the West Midlands, two of the worst affected areas.\nIn the previous week ending 3 April, 3,475 of deaths registered in England and Wales mentioned \u201cnovel coronavirus (Covid-19)\u201d \u2013 21% of those who died.\nAccording to separate, more up-to-date, figures from NHS hospitals in England and Wales released daily by Public Health England, the total death toll from confirmed Covid-19 since the start of the epidemic in hospitals in England and Wales reached 15,412 on Monday.\nThe latest figures on care deaths are set to fuel the row between social care bosses and ministers over whether enough has been done to save lives in care comes. Local Authority care bosses earlier this month warned the government that, in line with emerging research from the rest of the EU and North America, more people may be dying from coronavirus in care homes and the community than in hospitals, according to a leaked letter.\nMinisters have continued to quote the ONS figures while being forced to acknowledge that it is out of data.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care says it takes a minimum of 11 days for deaths in care homes to feed through into reporting, with the process of death registration taking five days or more. It said it was working with the ONS to speed up the process. Care home operators are obliged by law to quickly inform the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, of deaths but it only started asking whether people had died from Covid-19 on 9 April, two and a half weeks after Boris Johnson announced the UK-wide lockdown. CQC figures are expected to be included in the official data from 27 April.\nLiz Kendall, the shadow social care minister said they were \u201cawful figures\u201d only \u201cscratching the surface of the emerging crisis in social care, because they are already 11 days out of date.\u201d\n\u201cThe government must now publish daily figures of Covid-19 deaths outside hospital, including in care homes, so we know the true scale of the problem,\u201d she said.\n The death toll in care homes was \u201csad and shocking\u201d and exposes the \u201csevere challenge\u201d councils face, said Cllr Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s community wellbeing board.\n \u201cWe must take every possible step to protect our elderly and most vulnerable and those who work with them from this disease,\u201d he said. \u201cCouncil social care staff and care homes need urgent access to reliable and ongoing supplies of quality personal protective equipment, increased rapid and comprehensive testing and greater support with staffing and other equipment, on an equal footing with the NHS.\u201d\nOf 7,996 excess deaths compared to the five-year average, more than 6,000 were linked to Covid-19.\n Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

        "content": "The move raises thorny questions about civil rights amid the coronavirus pandemic\nFacebook said on Monday that it was banning users from organizing \u201cevents that defy government\u2019s guidance on social distancing\u201d. The company\u2019s decision to selectively enforce state public health orders came amid a spate of rallies protesting against statewide stay-at-home orders in cities cross the US, and it drew condemnation from rightwing supporters of the protest movement, Donald Trump Jr and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\nThe controversy highlighted the challenges that arise when a private company controls so much of the digital \u201cpublic square\u201d \u2013 especially at a time when access to physical public squares is limited by public health orders.\n\u201cMass public gatherings that ignore social distancing recommendations may well be creating a public health danger to those protesting and their communities,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cBut speech about government responses to the pandemic \u2013 from relief packages like the Cares Act to stay-home orders \u2013 is core political speech.\u201d\nThe relatively small anti-shutdown protests have received substantial media attention, as well as an implicit endorsement from Donald Trump. Much of the organizing for the rallies has occurred on Facebook, in a network of groups controlled by a family of pro-gun activists, the Washington Post and NBC News reported.\nBut the gatherings have been criticized by public health experts and healthcare workers. In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a group of nurses on Monday met a protest against stay-at-home orders with signs urging people to go home.\nOn Monday, Facebook said that it was requiring event pages for protests to make clear that participants must follow state social distancing rules \u2013 and that it would remove certain calls for protest.\n\u201cUnless government prohibits the event during this time, we allow it to be organized on Facebook,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cFor this same reason, events that defy government\u2019s guidance on social distancing aren\u2019t allowed on Facebook.\u201d\nThe aggressive move is in line with Facebook\u2019s overall approach to the pandemic, which has seen the company adopt a much more active editorial role than it has previously been willing to take on. But questions about its approach remain.\nCNN reported that Facebook had removed events pages for anti-quarantine protests in California, New Jersey and Nebraska \u201con the instruction of governments in those three states\u201d. But a company spokesman later said that it had spoken to government officials \u201cto understand the scope of their stay-at-home orders, not about removing any specific protest events from Facebook\u201d.\nThe question of whether Facebook took action against the protest pages on its own initiative or had acted at the behest of government officials is an important one.\n\u201cInformal requests from governments are extremely problematic,\u201d said Jennifer Brody of Access Now, a digital rights organization. \u201cThere should be transparency around takedown requests \u2026 State governments covertly nudging Facebook does not align with human rights norms.\u201d\nDavid Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, also questioned whether it was appropriate for Facebook to take action against specific protest pages, rather than leaving it to government bodies to make official takedown requests.\n\u201cWhether a protest is lawful or unlawful is a decision for government authorities to make on the ground,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cIf people show up to protest \u2013 and I think the vast majority of public health officials think that\u2019s really dangerous \u2013 it\u2019s up to the government to clamp down on them. For Facebook to do it just seems suspect.\u201d\nIndeed, if a state government were to make such a request of Facebook or any other platform, it would be subject to a challenge in court. But when Facebook makes decisions to take down content on its own, it is protected from legal liability by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that allows internet platforms to set their own content rules.\n\u201cThe normal democratically accountable way to go about this is that the government issues an order to Facebook to take down particular content through a legal mechanism,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cThis is the difference between accountable governance and unaccountable companies. A government that makes this decision is subject to law; they\u2019re subject to real legal constraint and remedy. Facebook is not.\u201d\nEidelman, of the ACLU, said: \u201cFacebook, which controls a platform for the speech of billions, should not be censoring political speech online,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is especially true now, when questions of when and how to reopen the country are among the central political questions, and online platforms are the main vehicle for expression.\u201d",

Uefa said on Tuesday that these guidelines would apply to \u201cspecial cases\u201d, with the Scottish top flight, alongside the Belgian and Dutch leagues, believed to be included in that definition. The Netherlands confirmed on Tuesday a three-month extension of the ban on major public events, meaning there will be no Dutch football played before 1 September.\nUefa\u2019s stance is a softening in the position of the governing body. In a joint letter with the European Clubs Association and the European Leagues, Uefa told its members on 2 April that \u201cevery effort must be made\u201d to complete domestic leagues and that they reserved the right to \u201cassess the entitlement\u201d of abandoned competitions to send clubs into European competitions next season.\nAlthough Uefa maintains a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d that competitions should be completed, the threat of suspension from European competition is almost certain to be removed as the complexity of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic continues to grow. Bizarrely Rangers, who are still in the current 2019-20 Europa League, look set to play games in it at the same time as the 2020-21 Scottish season which is hoping to kick off in early August.\nThe Scottish Professional Football League has decided to curtail competition in the country\u2019s lower divisions, after a lengthy and controversial process. The SPFL also has the right to force cancellation on the top flight, but this measure was contentious while European qualification was uncertain.\nIn a statement, Uefa said: \u201cThere was a strong recommendation given to finish domestic top division and cup competitions, but some special cases will be heard once guidelines concerning participation to European competitions \u2013 in case of a cancelled league \u2013 have been developed.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s ExCo meeting is also expected to confirm that the Women\u2019s European Championship, originally due to take place in England next year, will be played from 6-31 July 2022.

Sweden had only 29 new deaths on Sunday and 40 on Monday.

A further six authorities have stopped collecting glass or cardboard.\nCardiff city council said it was continuing to collect recycled material as usual and was asking residents to rinse out their recycling and sort items in the correct bags even though the materials would be incinerated for the near future.\n\u201cStrange as it seems, we still need you to put recyclables into your green recycling bags so that we can return to recycling the waste when we are able,\u201d the council said in a statement.\nThe coronavirus lockdown has generated a massive increase in domestic waste collection UK-wide, with nearly a third of authorities reporting an increase of between 20% and 50% on normal volumes of waste collected through household bins. Nearly one in 10 reported waste increases of up to twice as much as usual.\nThe pressure on local waste disposal services has been underlined by data showing that huge areas of the country have suspended bulky waste collection (55% of councils), garden waste disposal (29%), and food waste (10%) to cope with the crisis.\nA survey of 250 UK councils carried out by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (Adept) found that a quarter of local waste teams reported losing up to 40% of staff through illness or self-isolation last week.\nThe charity Keep Britain Tidy has warned that some councils are struggling to keep on top of fly-tipping, suggesting that it might be linked to an increase in DIY and decluttering as people stay at home, as well as the widespread closure of household recycling centres under physical distancing rules.\nHowever, all councils have maintained normal or near-normal levels of domestic refuse collection, and just 2% have suspended recycling. Fears that reductions in recycling collection would lead to a shortage of cardboard packaging have receded, with about 10 councils restarting suspended recycling services.\nIan Fielding, chair of Adept\u2019s Waste Group, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see that local authorities are maintaining core waste services with minimal disruption and that councils are able to put resources into tackling fly-tipping.\u201d\nJust 32% of councils are operating normal levels of street sweeping, the Adept survey showed, although the majority were experiencing only moderate or minor disruption. About 7% reported \u201csevere disruption\u201d to street cleaning services.\nRichard McIlwain, deputy chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said: \u201cAs organisations providing key frontline services, local authorities are having to prioritise core services, including the regular collection of our household waste.\n\u201cHowever, we are aware that some local authorities are reporting an increase in fly-tipping, potentially linked to the temporary closure of recycling centres. Fly-tipping is a serious environmental crime that blights local communities and harms wildlife, and local authorities should not be having to deal with increased illegal dumping.\n\u201cAt a time of national crisis, we all have a personal role to play in keeping our environment safe. If you have rubbish you can\u2019t put in your normal bin, either store it until the recycling centres are open or pay for a waste company to take it away, checking first that they are correctly licensed as a waste carrier with the Environment Agency and always ask for a receipt.\u201d\nAn Inverclyde council spokesperson said: \u201cThe reintroduction of recycling collections remains an urgent priority. Like most Scottish councils, we experienced a significant reduction in workforce due to national guidance around self-isolation.\u201d",

Others fancy the power or, all too often, the money.\nIt is uncommonly rare, particularly in sports administration, to find people genuinely keen to do it for altruistic reasons, for the benefit of the many rather than the few, or because they possess far-sighted vision and intelligence. Rugby, more than most, could do with a few more in the lesser-spotted latter category. The game at home and abroad is not awash with confidence in those in charge and it hardly requires a lockdown crystal ball to see that situation becoming worse before it improves.\nTo cap it all World Rugby has now been forced into an embarrassing climbdown after managing, as you do, to include a convicted killer on its official list of executive committee candidates. Tough game, rugby, but even so.\nIt was hardly a secret, particularly around the Pacific islands, that Fiji\u2019s Francis Kean is not the world\u2019s greatest bloke. Nevertheless, it required considerable courage for Dan Leo of Pacific Rugby Players Welfare to write a remarkable open letter to council members that ultimately forced World Rugby\u2019s hand. \u201cIt is extraordinary to anyone involved in the game in the Pacific that Kean is even on the ballot,\u201d wrote Leo, who has already done much to champion the cause of players from the Pacific islands and highlight some of the significant issues they face on and off the field.\nAs it happens, he is also a supporter of Agust\u00edn Pichot\u2019s campaign to become chairman of World Rugby in place of the incumbent, Bill Beaumont, who is seeking re-election. The ballot is due to take place next week and Pichot has not entirely given up hope of overcoming the odds which, as ever, remain stacked against those operating outside the cosy Six Nations club.\nAs it happens, Pichot and Beaumont are proud, respected rugby men and former national captains. Their manifestos, at first glance, are not poles apart. It is less about personalities, then, and more about priorities and open\u2011mindedness. World Rugby, a vast oil tanker that traditionally takes years to turn round, is being invited to hand the wheel to a new skipper more attuned to the renewable energy sector.\nIf it feels like a significant moment, that is because it is. Starboard for eight more years of old-school diplomacy \u2013 by naming Bernard Laporte as his running mate, Beaumont may feel he is keeping the seat warm for the former France national coach \u2013 or port for something different.\nThat the vote will be conducted by private ballot and the result not announced until 12 May says a fair amount about World Rugby\u2019s modus operandi. With the established nations permitted three votes while everyone else has to settle for two or one, this particular group of turkeys are not about to vote for Christmas. Self\u2011interest, as it has done for decades, shapes virtually everything.\nSome argue rugby already has enough to deal with and does not need any more apple carts upturned at this precise moment. That is not how they see it in Australia where 11 former Wallaby captains \u2013 George Gregan, Nick Farr-Jones, George Smith, Stirling Mortlock, Michael Lynagh, Simon Poidevin, Phil Kearns, Stephen Moore, Jason Little, Rod McCall and Nathan Sharpe \u2013 have written to Rugby Australia expressing their concerns about how the game there has been administered in recent years.\n\u201cThere is only one question that needs to be answered at club level, at state level and at national level: \u2018Is this decision in the best interests of Australian rugby?\u2019\u201d reads the letter. \u201cOnly when we can answer that question openly, honestly and transparently at all levels can we restore Australian rugby to greatness.\u201d\nThose labouring in office will argue that lobbing bricks from the sidelines is far easier than navigating a way out of the grim vortex of plummeting crowds and revenues, virus-hit fixture lists and thorny governance issues. Assorted national unions and league governing bodies are copping plenty of flak but, in their defence, the range of problems now being faced is more extensive \u2013 and potentially more worrying \u2013 than at any time.\nThere is a way out, though, for those leaders around the globe brave enough to grasp it. Why not, as the distinguished former Wallabies suggest, focus on doing the right thing, rather than taking the most expedient option? Why not engage more with the public and media and be frank and honest about the game\u2019s issues, rather than endlessly hiding behind corporate speak or ducking potentially awkward questions?\nOpenness might just encourage greater understanding and forgiveness and pierce the current perception, unfair or not, of certain executives making a priority of bottom lines rather than players. Lead, in short, by example. Without trust, pride and respect at its heart, rugby is nothing.",

Que grande es. https://t.co/crN1hdSI7D\nThat afternoon he drove home to Oviedo, almost 300km west. En route, he decided he had to do something and over the weekend he called Barakaldo to ask permission. That Monday the club released a video, in which he offered to help the fight against coronavirus \u2013 from the front line.\nIt was no empty offer. Cervero has scored 243 goals in his career, including one from inside his own half a week before Barakaldo suspended training and sent their players home. He is also a qualified doctor. And he was absolutely serious. He started sending emails, filling in forms, making calls. Dozens of them: to the medical colleges in Asturias, the Basque Country and Madrid, to the ministry of health, to the emergency field hospital rapidly assembled in the capital. He spoke to Imanol, Barakaldo\u2019s doctor. He asked friends and friends of friends. Every time they sent numbers or suggestions, he called. \u201cMedicine is a vocation,\u201d Cervero says. \u201cI felt I had to help.\u201d\nWhen he was young, Cervero would accompany his dad, Rafael, a surgeon, when he was on call. There is a photo of them in an operating theatre . He received his medical degree in seven years while playing football, beginning at Real Oviedo in 2003, and made moves motivated as much by medicine as the game but for as long as he was a professional footballer legally he could not occupy another job. That meant he couldn\u2019t do the MIR \u2013 m\u00e9dico interno residente \u2013 the equivalent of a house officer post where doctors specialise and complete their training. Although he earned a masters in sports nutrition and another in accidents and catastrophes, without the MIR he could not practice. That was the retirement plan.\nThe coronavirus crisis prompted the government to open the door to those with medical degrees. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t work in the public health system before but that\u2019s changed now: they needed people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a decree that means you can, given how dramatic the situation is. I don\u2019t have the knowledge of other doctors but I can do anything: man the phones, wheel beds around, take temperatures, change dressings, clean. I can\u2019t demand anything: I don\u2019t want a post and I will do it for free. And I\u2019ll go anywhere.\u201d\nLike most people, he has been going nowhere: stuck at home, training indoors and alone twice a day. \u201cThe Madrid government wrote to say thank you but they don\u2019t need anyone at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cAsturias said there was no need, Soria too.\u201d Mostly, there have been no replies, health authorities overwhelmed in a country where 20,000 people have died.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go anywhere,\u201d he repeats. Even England, say? \u201cYeah, absolutely, head first.\u201d There\u2019s a laugh. \u201cBut, then, you\u2019ve heard my English. If I can help, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nFor now, the striker turned doctor waits: sends more emails, writes more letters, makes more calls. He watched plans for some teams to make a return to training halted \u2013 a plan he describes as lamentable, and showing a \u201clack of morality\u201d, asking why footballers should be allowed to go for a run around a field while kids are climbing the walls at home \u2013 and he has seen the Football Federation propose a kind of express play-off system to get the second division B and third-division finished. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to test 50 players every game? And what about the grandmother that needs that test more?\u201d\nOn Wednesdays, the only day he leaves home, Cervero does the shopping, dropping food and medicine at his parents\u2019 home on the way back. \u201cMy dad was the Spanish record-holder in the hammer throw in the 1950s. There was a chance of him going to the Olympics but his medical career got in the way. He\u2019s 81 but he can lift 80 kilos still. It\u2019s nuts,\u201d he says.\n\u201cPeople call me \u2018Doc\u2019, but he\u2019s the real Doc: a surgeon, my idol. He\u2019s high-risk and he doesn\u2019t leave home, no matter what. The place is disinfected; they\u2019re following the rules exactly. They live on the fifth floor: I go there, leave the bags in the lift at the bottom, shout up to the them and say hello through the window.\u201d",

About 64 million subscribers watched Netflix\u2019s Tiger King documentary as much of the world went into lockdown to avoid the pandemic. Other hits included the reality show Love Is Blind, which attracted 30 million subscribers in the last three months, and its original film Spenser Confidential (85 million).\nThe company acknowledged that the huge surge in membership and audience was probably temporary.\n\u201cIn our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\u201cAt Netflix, we\u2019re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we\u2019re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth.\u201d\nMihir Haria Shah, head of broadcast at Total Media, said the long-term impact of the coronavirus on Netflix\u2019s business remained to be seen.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Netflix has been helped by the viral sensation that is Tiger King and also new seasons of Narcos Mexico, Ozark and Money Heist \u2013 which are all Netflix originals favourites. The challenge in continuing to grow and also preventing churn is likely to be how long they can sustain dripping in new series with production studios shut for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\nNetflix, like many other studios and networks, has shut down production on original content since 13 March. The streamer has since set up a $100m fund for workers whose jobs have been directly affected. Recent weeks have seen a number of large acquisitions, including the Paramount action comedy The Lovebirds and Enola Holmes, with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown as the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re certainly impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021,\u201d the statement said.",

He passed his physical with flying colors today. He\u2019s just really excited about playing football again, and being in Florida is exciting for him.\u201d\nGronkowski had announced his retirement in March 2019, citing the toll injuries had taken on his body. However, he is still only 30 and has kept in shape over the last year, during which he appeared as an NFL analyst on Fox. Gronkowski is considered one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, and the temptation of reuniting with Brady \u2013 with whom he won three Super Bowls \u2013 appears to have been too much to resist.\nWe've agreed to trade for TE Rob Gronkowski. \ud83d\udcf0: https://t.co/zaGisKOSFu pic.twitter.com/lujKVbOJFu\n\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d Gronkowski told Fox Sports on Tuesday. \u201cI always said when I have that feeling and it feels right, I will be ready to take the field again. And I have that feeling. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\nGronkowski is still technically under contract with the Patriots, and New England will receive a fourth-round draft pick from the Buccaneers as part of the trade. The Buccaneers will receive a seventh-round pick in return.\nThe NFL named Gronkowski to the league\u2019s 100th anniversary all-time team, a roster that also included Brady. He was named an All-Pro four times during his time with the Patriots, although he would have appeared more often if it were not for the injuries that plagued his career.\nIn March, Brady left the Patriots after two decades and six Super Bowl titles. Tuesday\u2019s trade gives the Bucs a potentially devastating offense, with Brady and Gronkowski alongside two highly talented wide receivers, Chris Godwin and Mike Evans.

Whoever they are, and it could be anyone given that description, they are wrong.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve said throughout that is a government target. We are working hard to hit it.\u201d\nJohnson has previously set a target of 250,000 tests a day, without putting a date on it.\nA cabinet source said Hancock may have irritated some in No 10 and there had been tensions between him and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, in the \u201cquad\u201d of decision-making. But they questioned whether Downing Street would seek to make Hancock a scapegoat at such a crucial time, when he has such an important role in coordinating the government\u2019s health response to the pandemic.\nHancock also received backing from an unlikely source \u2013 one of his Labour predecessors, Andy Burnham, who is mayor of Greater Manchester.\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything Matt Hancock has done but he has called some things right and I am certain he\u2019s working flat out right now in the PM\u2019s absence. With that in mind, this is an appalling move by Downing Street. It helps no one. Whoever\u2019s responsible should be ashamed,\u201d he said.\nHancock, speaking at No 10\u2019s daily press briefing, defended the UK\u2019s response \u2013 and by extension his handling of the health department \u2013 saying the international comparisons about the spread of infections should take into account the size of the country.\n\u201cAt the start of this crisis, we said there were two absolutely critical tasks that formed part of the battle plan. One is that we got the exponential spread of this under control and brought the curve down. As you can see, that curve is now flat and that means we have achieved that objective,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe second thing we said is that we must do everything we can to make sure the NHS is not overwhelmed. We have achieved that because every single person who has needed treatment has been able to get that treatment \u2026 On those two core measures, the plan is working.\n\u201cDoes it mean every problem has been addressed? No of course not. I\u2019ve gone through some of the details on PPE, where there are clearly challenges \u2026 But on the absolutely central core objectives, thanks to the work of the NHS, armed forces and many others, and people who have stayed at home, we have managed to bend down the curve and ensured NHS capacity is there.\u201d\nHe said he and his officials were looking every day at \u201chow do you learn from where things are going well and where things aren\u2019t going so well ... we are constantly looking around the world at these comparisons\u201d.",

She was due to return to prison this weekend.\nZaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been living at her parents\u2019 house in the Iranian capital while wearing an electronic tag, will not have to return to prison until at least 20 May. While on release she has been able to contact her husband Richard Ratcliffe in London and their five-year-old child, Gabriella, as many as five times a day.\nIt was also reported that 1,000 foreign prisoners were released as part of the Iranian furlough programme, introduced due to fears that coronavirus was sweeping through crowded Iranian prisons.\nRichard Ratcliffe welcomed the latest move and said the family has asked his wife be granted clemency. Ratcliffe agreed to hold off heavy campaigning until June to give the British and Iranian diplomats time to reach a solution.\nRatcliffe met the British ambassador to Iran in London for an update a fortnight ago. \u201cThis is a lot more normal,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe have been complaining about the prosaics of home schooling and normal parenting \u2013 it\u2019s been nice to muddle our way through that together.

It\u2019s lovely.\u201d\nMahmoud Behzadi-Rad, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s lawyer, told the semi-official Iranian news agency IRNA on Tuesday that his client\u2019s leave was extended again during a visit to the prison\u2019s supervising judge.\nZaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini airport while travelling to show her young daughter, Gabriella, to her parents in April 2016. She was sentenced to five years in prison, accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denies.\nShe was later afforded diplomatic protection by the UK government, which argues that she is innocent and that her treatment by Iran failed to meet obligations under international law.\nZaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s constituency MP, Tulip Siddiq, tweeted on Tuesday morning: \u201cVery happy to hear from Richard Ratcliffe that Nazanin\u2019s furlough has been extended for a month \u2013 in line with other prisoners in Iran.\u201d\nThe Labour MP added: \u201cNow is the time for our government to do all it can to make it permanent.\u201d\nAmnesty International said: \u201cThere should be no question of Nazanin ever being sent back to Evin prison. There are numerous reports of Covid-19 in Iranian jails, with detainees pleading for basic things like soap to help combat the disease.\u201d\nIn a league table of press freedom Reporters without Borders said Iran had slipped a further three places and was now 173rd out of 178 countries.\nIran insists its official figures showed the coronavirus was being brought slowly under control. A total of 88 new deaths in the past 24 hours and 1,297 new cases were recorded, the health ministry said on Tuesday. This brings the total number of deaths in Iran due to the virus to 5,297. The total number of new infections has been stable for the past four days after a period of sharp decline. Iran claims to have performed over 350,000 tests for the disease, an increasing number that is likely to lead to a higher number of identified cases.\nThe country has struggled to contain the virus outbreak since reporting its first cases on 19 February. Some officials and health experts in Iran and abroad have said the country\u2019s casualty figures may be higher than it has declared.\nIran allowed businesses \u2013 except those considered high-risk such as restaurants and gyms \u2013 to reopen after closing most of its economy in mid-March. The reopening drew criticism from health experts and even some government officials.",

This month 85% of cases heard in England and Wales were using audio and video technology.\nThe EHRC report quotes criminal justice experts warning that the \u201chuman element\u201d was missing from such remote interactions. \u201cTrust and rapport are harder to build up \u2026 people and behaviours can be easily misunderstood over remote technology.\u201d\nSuch barriers to communication were \u201ccompounded by the short time slots available for video consultations\u201d between lawyers and their clients who might be in a prison, at a police station or elsewhere.\n\u201cSlots for meetings are up to 15 minutes and often shorter, even if the quality of the link is poor,\u201d the report warns. \u201cThis may be the first opportunity that a defence solicitor or advocate has to meet their client.\u201d\nThe EHRC, the government\u2019s advisory body on human rights and equality issues, has not called for video and audio hearings to be halted but has expressed concern about the lack of data available on remote hearings and has urged the government to begin collecting information.\nOne unnamed defendant told the EHRC: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I would call a real court because I was in a room all on my own with a screen, but I couldn\u2019t hear what was being said ... I found it very difficult and I was unable to take part in it.\u201d\nDavid Isaac, the commission\u2019s chair, said: \u201cCoronavirus presents an unprecedented public health emergency and we know that the government is working hard to allow our justice system to continue to function \u2026 [But] it is vital that any new approaches should not accentuate the difficulties that already exist for disabled people in accessing justice.\n\u201cEquality before the law means that no one defending themselves in court should be disadvantaged because they are disabled - even during a time of national crisis.\u201d",

        "content": "Number of firms using job retention scheme rising with more mulling access, according to British Chamber of Commerce\nMore than 70% of private firms have furloughed staff in response to the coronavirus lockdown, according to the latest survey of Britain\u2019s struggling business sector.\nThe British Chamber of Commerce said responses to its weekly Covid-19 tracker poll revealed the proportion of firms that have furloughed at least some staff increased to 71% this week, from 66% last week.\nAn escalating cash crisis meant that 59% of firms reported they have \u2013 at most \u2013 three months of funds in reserve, the BCC said.\nOn Monday more than 140,000 firms applied for the government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which pays 80% of a workers salary up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month to stay at home.\nHowever, the BCC survey found that many more companies will need to access the scheme, which is run by HMRC.\nAbout 30% of firms have sent home between 75% and 100% of their workforce.\nAdam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, said many firms needed the government cash before April\u2019s payday this week.\n\u201cThis is a crunch week for businesses relying on the job retention scheme to pay their staff,\u201d Marshall said.\n\u201cHMRC\u2019s capacity to deal with the demand from business has been encouraging so far. It is now critical that payments from the furlough scheme reach businesses as smoothly and as quickly as possible in order to protect jobs and livelihoods.\u201d\nFigures showing the increase in firms using the furlough scheme followed official data that depicted a weakening jobs market as the UK prepared to enter the coronavirus lockdown period.\nFigures covering the three months to the end of February showed the economy struggling to overcome Brexit uncertainty and the impact of cuts to welfare benefits that forced many older women and young people to take low-paid employment.\nUnemployment increased from 3.9% to 4.0%, the number of job vacancies edged lower for the tenth consecutive month and wages continued to fall from a peak last June, the Office for National Statistics said.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u00a0a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nPeter Beaumont,\u00a0Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\nThe weakening outlook contrasted with the rising employment rate, which continued a long-term trend after it reached a record of 76.6%, which was 0.4 percentage points up on the year and 0.2 percentage points up on the quarter.\n\u201cEstimates for December 2019 to February 2020 show a record 33.07m people aged 16 years and over in employment, 352,000 more than a year earlier,\u201d the ONS said.\nThis annual increase was mainly driven by women in employment \u2013 up by 318,000 on the year to a record high of 15.7m and workers aged above 50 years, who added 258,000 to the total to a record high of 10.7m. The number of people aged 25 to 34 years also reached a record high \u2013 up by 96,000 to reach 7.64m.\nWomen above the age of 60 have entered the jobs market in droves over recent years following an acceleration of the government\u2019s push to equalise pension rights between men and women, forcing many women to wait longer to claim their state pension.\nThe increase in self-employed workers \u2013 up by 195,000 to 5.03m over the last year \u2013 outstripped the increase in the number of full-time employees, which increased by 184,000 over the same period to 20.87m.\nHowever, annual wages, excluding bonuses, fell from 3% in the three months to January to 2.9% in February and in real terms slumped to 1.3%.\nJohn Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said: \u201cThe UK labour market looks to have cooled before the Covid-19 lockdown measures placed the economy in a coma to help save lives.\n\u201cAlthough the number of people in work increased by a fairly healthy 172,000 in the three months to February this was not enough to prevent a rise of 58,000 in the number unemployed, lifting the unemployment rate back to 4%.\n\u201cCooling was also evident in a fall in total hours worked, fewer job vacancies and softening in the rate of growth of average weekly earnings.\n\u201cGiven what we know about the massive shock to the economy in the past month, it\u2019s disconcerting to see that the jobs market was already starting to look a bit off colour when Covid-19 arrived on our shores.\u201d\nThe minister for employment, Mims Davies, said that while the jobs figures had been overtaken by \u201cthe worst public health emergency in our lifetimes\u201d, the statistics,\nincluding a 4% unemployment rate, \u201cdo serve as an important reminder of the strong foundations we have built as we look to withstand impact on the global economy.\u201d",

Not one of those 90 horses has come home in front. The draw has slightly less impact at longer trips, but stalls one and two still account for 17 of 57 winners in the same period over the eight-and-a-half furlongs, the trip for the races at 1.15 and 2.15.\n11.45 Stall eight for Purton and possible favourite Kwai Chung Elite, which is not ideal over six furlongs here as stall one has produced twice as many winners \u2013 18, in fact \u2013 over the last two-and-a-half seasons as any other (and stall two is next, with nine). Around 6-1 looks fair for Aurora Steed, who should be well positioned from three by Chad Schofield.\n12.15 Six furlongs again and Blade Racer, a 16-1 shot in early betting, could make the most of stall one. This will be his first race over this trip at Happy Valley after four attempts over five, but he sprang a surprise over six at Sha Tin in September last year and his draw gives him every chance.\n12.45 London Hall and Above were both winners last time out and attempt to defy hikes in the weights. London Hall is up 7lb for a three-quarter length win and though Above is up 12lb, he was a very smooth six-length winner at Sha Tin and has could be good enough to take this step up in class.\n1.15 Invaluable is one of the most lightly-raced runners in the field and showed his best form to date when fourth over course and distance last time out. A price of around 5-1 look reasonable.\n1.45 Winning Ways will be a popular choice from stall four with Purton holding the reins. He was a CD winner three outings ago and competitive off today\u2019s mark next time up, while he got in all sorts of bother when only seventh last time.\n2.15 Another big chance for Purton on last-time winner Tangmere, but Blooming Spirit has an equally good chance on paper and looks likely to be a bigger price.\n2.45 Purton on a possible favourite once again with Lucky Quality drawn in stall one, but he does not have as much early pace as several of his opponents and Happy Good Guys, drawn just outside in two, could be better placed to strike.\n3.15 Dancing Fighter was coming back from a 112-day break when only eighth \u2013 and a beaten favourite \u2013 over CD last time, but he missed the kick badly from stall nine and has a much better pitch in two this time and Purton can make the most of it.\n3.50 The second of two Class Three races, worth \u00a380,000 to the winner apiece, at the end of the card. Larson was a ready winner last time out but is up 6lb and could be vulnerable from stall 10. Classic Unicorn has the rail pitch and should make it count.",

And about calls for states to be \u201cliberated\u201d from restrictions, which Donald Trump has himself echoed, Redfield said in the interview: \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\nAlso on Tuesday, a malaria drug frequently touted by Trump for treating Covid-19 showed no benefit in a large analysis of its use in US veterans hospitals. There were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine than those given standard care, researchers reported.\nThe nationwide study was not a rigorous experiment. But with 368 patients, it is the largest study yet of hydroxychloroquine, with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, for Covid-19. Coronavirus has killed more than 44,000 people in the US so far.\nThe study was posted on a website for researchers and has not been reviewed by other scientists. Grants from the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia paid for the work.\nResearchers analyzed medical records of 368 male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at Veterans Health Administration medical centers who died or were discharged by 11 April.\nAbout 28% who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone. About 22% of those getting the drug plus azithromycin died too, but the difference between that group and usual care was not considered large enough to rule out other factors that could have affected survival.\nHydroxychloroquine made no difference in the need for a breathing machine, either.\nTrump has repeatedly hyped the drug and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided hydroxychloroquine with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. But the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to ascertain fully whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.",

It has appealed not only to the league but to the respective chairmen of the top division\u2019s clubs, highlighting what it says is a threat their intellectual property \u2013 and incomes.\nGiven that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund is set to take an 80% stake in Newcastle \u2013 with the Yorkshire-born financier Amanda Staveley and the UK company Reuben Brothers each assuming 10% holdings \u2013 and beIN is one of the Premier League\u2019s principal overseas broadcast partners the potential diplomatic repercussions could be considerable.\nNonetheless, sources working on the takeover remain confident there will be no last-minute hitches, hinting that Premier League checks that have been under way for a fortnight are approaching a conclusion. It has also been noted that, despite similar concerns, the Premier League approved Sheffield United\u2019s transfer into full Saudi ownership last year.\nThe Premier League, along with other domestic governing bodies and rights holders, has previously urged Arabsat, the Saudi state satellite broadcaster which transmits across the Arab world, to withdraw a framework for a pirate network known as beoutQ that they argued was abusing the game. It started its illegal streaming activities in 2017, the year Saudi and Qatar became involved in a significant political argument with assorted international ramifications, and no one has succeeded in halting the transmissions.\nLast July the Premier League said it had spoken to nine law firms in Saudi Arabia who either refused to act or later recused themselves when asked about pursuing a copyright complaint against beoutQ.\nYousef al-Obaidly, the chief executive of beIN, has written to the chairmen of Premier League clubs saying \u201cthe potential acquirer of Newcastle United [has] caused huge damage to your club\u2019s and the Premier League\u2019s commercial revenues\u201d.\nObaidly, on the board at Qatar-funded Paris Saint-Germain, added: \u201cThe legacy of the illegal service will continue to impact you going forward.

Lee, the 81-year-old founder of the Democratic party and a senior barrister, was among 15 veteran pro-democracy activists arrested by Hong Kong police on Saturday on charges of illegal assembly, accused of being involved in unapproved protests last year.\nJust the night before, China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong declared it was not bound by a clause in the city\u2019s post-handover mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which bars the Chinese government from interfering in local affairs. Amid accusations of overreach by Beijing into the city\u2019s legislative council and judiciary escalate, the liaison office\u2019s chief, Luo Huining, also called for national security legislation to be urgently passed.\nChina\u2019s high-profile posturing over Hong Kong over the past week signals a turbulent political future for the semi-autonomous city, with mass protests likely to return to the streets, analysts say.\nPerceived national security threats amid an economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and tense relationship with the US has prompted China to prod Hong Kong, roiled by months of anti-government protests since June last year, to speed up legislation of a controversial anti-subversion law which was shelved in 2003, they say.\nChina has long been growing impatient with Hong Kong\u2019s perceived \u201cwaywardness\u201d \u2013 particularly after pro-democracy movements in 2014 and last year. In a policy white paper in June 2014, China asserted that it had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong and in August that year, ruled that it would allow \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d so long as it can first vet the leadership candidates. In the communique of a key Communist party meeting in November 2019, the fourth plenum, Beijing told the city to \u201cperfect\u201d its legal system to safeguard national security.\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s consistent attitude is to speed up the legislation of article 23 to bring Hong Kong under its national security network and to complete its control over Hong Kong,\u201d said Wu Qiang, a political scientist formerly with Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. \u201cIt is determined that Hong Kong will not become a \u2018loophole\u2019 in the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nWhile the world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing took the opportunity to crack down on Hong Kong\u2019s most respected pro-democracy leaders, analysts say.\n\u201cWhile China was brought to its knees by Covid-19, [president] Xi Jinping held back from implementing the hardline on Hong Kong, but now that China has come out of it while the western democracies are on their knees and dependent on China for personal protective equipment, what better time than now to take the offensive?\u201d said Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.\n\u201cBolster authoritarian control amid the pandemic \u2013 this is Beijing\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Wu.\nAnalysts warn that China\u2019s repression of Hong Kong will only intensify in the near future, particularly in the run-up to the September legislature election. Some also believe China wants to pass the article 23 legislation before the election, which might see the democrats claiming a majority amid widespread discontent aimed at the government.\n\u201cAfter the immediate \u2018shock and awe\u2019 effect, Beijing will turn to the legislative council and the September election,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, political scientist at the Hong Kong Baptist University. Draconian anti-subversion laws passed under article 23 \u201cwould give the authorities new powers to persecute and purge the pro-democracy leaders and activists before the legislative council election in September,\u201d he said.\nTo ensure that the outcomes of the election are controlled, Chan expected that Beijing may seek to disqualify some democrats, or cancel the election altogether and appoint a \u201cprovisional Legislative Council\u201d filled with pro-establishment figures.\nWith Beijing\u2019s recent manoeuvre, it might be puzzling why China does not seem to care about throttling \u201cthe goose that lays the golden eggs\u201d. But Tsang said even though China is still dependent on Hong Kong for trade and business, its dependency has lessened markedly over the past three decades, with Hong Kong\u2019s GDP sliding from about a third the size of China\u2019s in the 1980s to less than 3% in 2019.\n\u201cThe loss of 3% of GDP would be painful but not intolerable,\u201d Tsang said of Chinese leaders\u2019 mentality. \u201cSo it is not unreasonable for Beijing to feel that \u2026 it would be a price China can pay. So, why not take a hard line now?\u201d\nLondon-based Hong Kong Watch points out that the Asian financial hub\u2019s value should however not be understated as it remains a gateway for western capital to reach mainland markets - it is the home to the largest number of initial public offerings by Chinese firms and the largest offshore centre for bond sales by Chinese companies.\nBut as resilient as China may seem, analysts and activists warn that this is not the end of the game. Beijing-based political commentator Zhang Lifan said China\u2019s \u201cMao-era struggle mentality that wants to win at all cost\u201d may ultimately backfire.\nJoshua Wong, the 23-year-old political activist, does not believe China will succeed in intimidating Hongkongers but would instead \u201cprompt them to resist\u201d.\nIf the anti-subversion law goes ahead, hundreds of thousands are expected to be up in arms again, reigniting the anti-government movement which has largely paused amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cDriving the opposition into the political wilderness serves Beijing\u2019s short-term interest, but it will embolden the opposition in civil society and attract more, not less, international attention,\u201d Chan said.\nMartin Lee, a drafter of the Basic Law, said he felt \u201cproud to walk the road of democracy with the outstanding youths in Hong Kong\u201d and his experience has only strengthened his will.\n\u201cI\u2019ll not give up,\u201d he told the Guardian.",

        "content": "President says he could extend measure depending on health of economy amid coronavirus\nDonald Trump has announced a 60-day ban on immigrants seeking to live and work in America permanently, and said he could extend it depending on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe US president framed the executive order, which he expects to sign on Wednesday, as an effort to protect American workers from foreign competition. He said it would apply only to those seeking green cards and not temporary workers, but he did not explain how those whose applications are currently being processed would be affected.\n\u201cBy pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens \u2013 so important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.\u201d\nThe \u201cpause\u201d would be in effect for 60 days, he added, after which the need for an extension or alternation would be reviewed \u201cbased on economic conditions at the time\u201d. Under questioning, he confirmed that he might then decide to add a further 30 days or more.\nTrump said: \u201cThis order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency. In other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. It will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis ... We want to protect our US workers and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\u201d\nThe president, who has long campaigned against illegal immigration and again touted his US-Mexico border wall at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, added that the move would help conserve medical resources for US citizens.\nAbout a million people were granted green cards last year. The biggest share are family-based immigration sponsorships for permanent residency of foreign nationals by their American spouses. Alexander Hunter-Mihali\u0107, a CNN producer, tweeted: \u201cMy wife\u2019s greencard renewal is being \u2013 or was being \u2013 processed. What does that mean for her?\u201d\nThe remarks followed an ambiguous tweet on Monday night that caught his own officials by surprise and provoked an angry backlash from immigration rights groups and Democrats.\nJoe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to take on Trump in November\u2019s election, said: \u201cRather than execute a swift and aggressive effort to ramp up testing, Donald Trump is tweeting incendiary rhetoric about immigrants in the hopes that he can distract everyone from the core truth: he\u2019s moved too slowly to contain this virus, and we are all paying the price for it.\u201d\nAli Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s call to suspend immigration to the US ignores the reality of our situation: the fact is that immigrants are standing shoulder to shoulder with US citizens on the frontlines helping us get through this pandemic. How many families would go without health care, food or otherwise if it wasn\u2019t for immigrants working alongside native-born Americans yesterday, today and tomorrow?\u201d\nImmigrants account for 17% of healthcare workers and 24% of direct care workers nationwide, Noorani added, while H-1B visa holders are helping to find a vaccine to Covid-19 and agricultural workers continue to be essential in maintaining food chains that re-supply grocery stores.\nMayra Mac\u00edas, executive director of Latino Victory, said: \u201cTrump is once again using his old playbook of scapegoating immigrants to cover up his failures. But we will not be fooled \u2013 he\u2019s doing it to distract us from his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\nIn practice, much of the US immigration system has already been paralysed by the pandemic. Travel from China, parts of Europe and Iran is mostly banned and most state department visa services are suspended. The administration has used the crisis to effectively end asylum at US borders, including turning away children who arrive by themselves and putting a hold on refugee resettlement.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s briefing Trump was also questioned about a malaria drug that he has been pushing relentlessly as a therapy for coronavirus, championing a Democratic state representative in Michigan who claimed it benefited her and frequently imploring: \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d\nAn analysis showed that nearly a third of military veterans died when treated with hydroxychloroquine, more than patients who received standard treatment. The president appeared to shrug off the finding, saying: \u201cObviously there have been some very good reports. Perhaps this one\u2019s not a good report but we\u2019ll be looking at it.\u201d\nDr Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s commissioner, cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the 368-patient sample. \u201cThis study is a small retrospective study at the VA [Veterans Affairs],\u201d Hahn said. \u2018This is something that a doctor would need to consider as part of a decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine.\u201d\nEarlier on Tuesday Trump hosted Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, at the White House, with testing top of the agenda. He said they agreed that the hospital ship USNS Comfort was no longer required by the state. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we could have it for other locations and he said we would be able to do that.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time and we\u2019ll get it ready for its next mission, which will I\u2019m sure be a very important one also. But it was an honour.\u201d\nThe US has 823,786 confirmed cases of the virus, and 44,999 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. More than 4 million people have been tested.",

        "content": "Volunteers in Wellington tap micro-grant scheme to ensure vulnerable people are not left left without essentials\nWhen Lauryn Miller was forced to stay at home during New Zealand\u2019s stringent Covid-19 lockdown, which has barred everyone but essential workers from leaving their houses, she jumped at the chance \u201cto do something for anyone\u201d.\nMiller, 34, who usually works as a librarian in New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington \u2013 and lives in the quiet, beachfront suburb of Lyall Bay \u2013 has been helping, along with her friends, to deliver food parcels to people nearby who have been left vulnerable during the four-week national shutdown.\n\u201cFor about three years or so I\u2019ve been going over to the apartments, at first in a library capacity, to make relationships with people who might not know that the library is available,\u201d Miller says, referring to the council flats where she delivers some of the packages. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got a lot of friendships that are there.\u201d\nShe and her friends from the suburb\u2019s tiny Lyall Bay Community church have navigated strident restrictions on moving around the city during the lockdown, public health precautions and item limits on supermarket purchases to put together the food parcels and distribute them over fences and on doorsteps.\nThe food parcels are funded by new micro-grants from the New Zealand government based on the idea that those who know their neighbours will be best placed to assist them. NZ$4.8m (\u00a32.4m) \u2013 almost $1 for every New Zealander \u2013 has been set aside for the scheme, which groups can apply for in up to $5,000 lump sums to spend on projects that improve local wellbeing.\nWhen New Zealand\u2019s stringent stay-home rules began in late March, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, urged people to support each other.\n\u201cGo home tonight and check on your neighbours, start a phone tree with your street, plan how you\u2019ll stay in touch with one another,\u201d she said. Four weeks later, 14 people have died of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with new infections slowed to a trickle.\n\u201cWe will get through this together, but only if we stick together, so please be strong and be kind,\u201d Ardern added.\nBut uncertainty has grown for the plight of New Zealanders most in need when the lockdown ends. Demand for grocery parcels has risen throughout the country during the pandemic, and the coordinator of one food bank in the North Island town of Masteron told Radio New Zealand this week that it had almost run out of stock.\nAt a flat close to Miller\u2019s home in Lyall Bay, Lizzie, 52, says the charity that she usually visits for food is shuttered because it relies on leftover food from local cafes, which are also closed. She lives alone, and spent the first anniversary of her mother\u2019s death in total isolation.\nWhen Miller \u2013 who she has known \u201cfor years\u201d \u2013 knocked on her door recently with a food parcel, she was relieved to see a face she knew. A packet of chocolate biscuits in her food parcel was equally welcome.\nLizzie has asthma and is prone to bronchitis, but adds that if she does get sick she will not have to \u201cgo out and get groceries and put other people at risk\u201d, because she is receiving the parcels. Advocates for marginalised people fear that others have fallen through the cracks.\nFor Cindy Newport, 34, a Lyall Bay resident and friend of Miller\u2019s, hearing from someone in the neighbourhood who had struggled to connect with New Zealand\u2019s social welfare agency by phone in the lockdown\u2019s early days had spurred her to apply for the government micro-grant. The ministry for social development recorded 75,000 phone calls \u2013 an unprecedented number \u2013 asking for help over four days near the start of the shutdown. It said in a statement that call volumes were now back to normal.\nThe agency had slashed red tape on the grants in favour of speed \u2013 with barely any paperwork required \u2013 and the money appeared in the Lyall Bay group\u2019s bank account just days after they had applied for it.\n\u201cIt was the most straightforward thing I\u2019d ever done,\u201d Newport says.\nA military-style operation began between Newport, her husband and their flat mates to safely acquire goods for the food parcels without spreading infection. As New Zealand\u2019s winter approaches, they will also supply heaters and blankets to those who need them.\n\u201cWhat I am anticipating is that we haven\u2019t even seen the impact of job losses yet,\u201d she says. \u201cWe might be a nice, affluent suburb but the reality is that a lot of people will have impacts from this so I think the needs are only going to increase.\u201d\nLyall Bay is a friendly, relaxed area but although its beachfront cafes are closed and surfing is banned, the old spirit is still evident. A block from Newport\u2019s house, one family has kept a diary in chalk on the footpath during the lockdown. \u201cDay 9: It\u2019s tough, but do what you can to help others,\u201d one slogan reads.\nAt nearby Lyall Bay school, swings and netball courts sit empty; usually the grounds are hectic with families in the afternoons or at weekends.\n\u201cI hated having to lock the gates the other day,\u201d says Melanie Dean, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d\nOf the 13 food parcels the Lyall Bay group had packed in the first 24 hours after receiving their grant, 10 were left with families whose children attended the school.\nDean says she asked staff to nominate those who might be in need \u201cfor a variety of reasons\u201d, before one teacher who has worked at the school for more than 20 years picked up the parcels from Newport\u2019s home and delivered them anonymously.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to receive help like that, even if they need it,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even contact the families to let them know. We just dropped it on their doorsteps as a surprise.\u201d",

        "content": "With the sport\u2019s cash position in disarray, disquiet is brewing among the players and their representative body\nIn the first weeks of the pandemic, lovers of cricket in Australia might have concealed a little guilt. While the winter codes flailed, it appeared cricket would be spared the immediate hellfire of Covid-19. And whatever your level of financial literacy, or your view of Cricket Australia\u2019s long tail of hawkish administration, just about everybody believed that the organisation was rich.\nHowever, many weeks later, long after Eddie McGuire publicly begged the AFL membership base and rugby league floated NRL Island, Australia\u2019s summer game now appears mired among the winter codes in its financial desperation.\nWhereas two weeks ago there were assurances of \u201cenough equity and agility within the business to absorb\u201d the immediate financial impact of the coronavirus, CA has now stood down 80 per cent of its staff until July, effectively saying that unless it does so, the lights will go off in August. Chief executive Kevin Roberts said the body had already lost $20m during Covid-19 and that \u201chundreds of millions\u201d more would be in jeopardy if India failed to tour this summer. On the face of it, these are the signs of an organisation in dreadful financial shape.\nWhile those wanting to comprehend the subsequent figures might be wishing they\u2019d pursued a finance degree, you don\u2019t need to be a PwC graduate to justifiably wonder how both cricket, and its rival codes, are in such bad shape. How does Australia, which after Switzerland is the second-wealthiest nation in the world per-capita, find three, possibly four, of its most popular codes in dire straits mere weeks into the shutdown?\nOf course, nobody saw the pandemic coming, especially in its speed and scale. But put crudely, Cricket Australia\u2019s poor overarching cash position has been worryingly exposed, now that the music\u2019s stopped. As Warren Buffett put it, \u201conly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked\u201d.\nBeyond the financial technicalities of Cricket Australia\u2019s balance sheet, it is clear we are witnessing a scenario endemic of broader, longstanding issues of governance across all sports in Australia, and the cultures that pervade. It is often forgotten that Cricket Australia is a not-for-profit organisation, receiving taxpayer funds, that administers the game on behalf of the Australian people. By extension, its constituents are entitled to wonder why a not-for-profit has tied a percentage of its reserves up in risky equities, or, why a not-for-profit was engaging with risky equities in the first place. As Peter Lalor pointed out in The Australian recently, by contrast, the AFL \u2013 long regarded as the commercial standard-bearer in Australian sport \u2013 has declared zero stock market exposure. It will be curious to learn who governed these decisions at Jolimont, and whether or not Cricket Australia was relying upon these reserves to give it a return into investment markets like equities to pay future return payments to players.\nIndeed, this is the other lens through which many are viewing the issue. With national contracts slated to be announced by 30 April, there is a familiar sense of disquiet brewing among the players and their representative body, the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association. Despite CA\u2019s public assurances otherwise, the ACA currently remains out of the loop, and after three years of cordial relations, the players body now finds itself second-guessing Jolimont\u2019s next move. There\u2019s a suggestion that Cricket Australia\u2019s dramatically altered posture may be designed to clear the path for a renegotiated player-pay deal, so purportedly parlous are the game\u2019s finances. While the current arrangement sees the players take a share of the revenue \u2013 riding its highs and lows \u2013 some believe CA may be preparing to propose a pay cut over-and-above the existing agreement. The extent to which such a move would be a function of the pandemic or poor administration appears entirely dependent upon who you ask, and it may be too early to judge.\nIf this is CA\u2019s play, it would amount to staggering brinkmanship on its part. While some were initially willing to entertain the possibility of a public bluff, it would be hard to believe an organisation would sit down most of its staff in order to achieve these negotiated ends.\nWhen Roberts was asked to describe his aims for the relationship with the ACA in 2018, the term he used was \u201cdeepening\u201d. On that note, now might be an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the depth of that relationship, when the going is tough. A deep relationship might be one where he says to ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson, \u201cAlistair, we\u2019ve got a problem\u201d. However, with eight days until national contracts are due to be announced, CA\u2019s books are closed and the ACA believes there is little transparency, both of which were communicated by fast bowler Josh Hazlewood during, strangely, one of CA\u2019s own recent media conferences.\nIt all paints a fairly bleak picture for head office, for whom it appears one of two things are happening: its finances are either regrettably bad, which should be cause for great concern, or possibly we\u2019re seeing an extraordinary negotiating position, for whom the standing down of staff is merely a tactic.\nAnd as the imbroglio plays out, many involved in cricket\u2019s grassroots will be left to watch on, wondering what this means, and whether or not cricket this summer is viable for them and their communities, now that the music has stopped.",

The possible connection was made because local health officials are now asking newly infected people whether they participated in the election.\n\u201cIt means they were at the polls, which is a potential exposure, but [we] can\u2019t say they definitely got it at the polls,\u201d said Darren Rauch, the health officer/director for suburban Greenfield, and one of the health officials helping with the coronavirus response in the Milwaukee area.\nMilwaukee officials are still gathering information from about 70% of people who have tested positive since the election.\nThe election, which included a presidential primary as well as a state supreme court race and local offices, took place after a legal struggle between Democrats and Republicans.\nThousands of Wisconsin voters stayed home, unwilling to risk their health and unable to be counted because requested absentee ballots never arrived.\nDemocrats and voting rights groups have filed lawsuits to expand mail and absentee voting options, and pushed for an extra $2bn to help states adjust their election systems. National Republicans are fighting those efforts, while Donald Trump claims without evidence that mail-in voting is vulnerable to fraud.",

That concern was raised in the findings of a Senate inquiry in 2018, which urged Defence to \u201cimprove the consent process\u201d.\nDefence says it has since implemented the recommendations of previous inquiries and taken steps to ensure that the new chloroquine trial is voluntary. The department said the safety of its personnel \u201cis our highest priority\u201d.\nThe shadow defence personnel minister, Shayne Neumann, agreed that there was a need for Australia to do everything it could to tackle Covid-19, including conducting clinical trials.\nBut he also warned it was critical that the trial program was truly voluntary, saying the safety and health of ADF members was \u201cparamount\u201d.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cIt is important that those defence personnel who participate in any drug trial are properly informed of the nature of the trial and do so voluntarily,\u201d Neumann told Guardian Australia. \u201cAny trials must be conducted safely and ethically, and be completely voluntary.\u201d\nLambie said the trials had to be conducted with more stringent oversight and accountability than the mefloquine tests. She said she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to see this as another cover-up, like the mefloquine \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to go in a lot harder and watch what\u2019s going on than what they did with the mefloquine,\u201d Lambie told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat safety are they putting in?

What checks?\u201d\n\u201cIf they haven\u2019t learnt from the first time they did this, without having all that appropriately put in place \u2026 who\u2019s policing all this?\u201d\nDefence said the current trial was not an anti-malarial trial like that conducted with mefloquine. Instead, it involved the testing of a \u201cwell-known drug for a new purpose\u201d.\nThe trial would involve civilian and ADF healthcare workers. It would also be entirely voluntary and require a \u201cdeliberate action\u201d by potential volunteers wanting to take part.\n\u201cThis requires taking action to access and read all online information, watch a video explaining the trial and to make an appointment to attend in-person for evaluation,\u201d Defence said. \u201cThey are then carefully screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\u201d\nParticipants would be required to fill out daily questionnaires detailing the state of their health and wellbeing, Defence said. Close monitoring would take place and participants could quit at any time.\n\u201cWell conducted clinical trials are needed in the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Defence said.\nThe US Centres for Disease Control has described chloroquine as \u201ca relatively well-tolerated medicine\u201d, which has some side-effects, including most commonly stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and headaches.\nAustralia\u2019s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, also says the side-effects of chloroquine can include headaches, skin eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbance, psoriarsis and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes, anxiety, personality change, seizures and blood disorders.\nThe actor and singer Rita Wilson was given chloroquine when she and her husband, Tom Hanks, tested positive for Covid-19 this year in Australia. Wilson claimed to have suffered side-effects including nausea and vertigo.\nResearch out of the US tested the similar compound of hydroxychloroquine in veterans\u2019 hospitals. The Associated Press reported that the study \u2013 which was not rigorous or peer-reviewed \u2013 showed no benefit for Covid-19 patients. More deaths were recorded for those given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care, the study said.\nAssoc Prof Jane Quinn, a pharmaceuticals researcher at Charles Sturt University\u2019s school of veterinary sciences, has worked with veterans to study neuropsychiatric conditions arising from quinolone anti-malarials like mefloquine.\nQuinn said she was concerned that Defence\u2019s \u201cmanagement of past trials of these sorts of drugs\u201d was problematic. She said the military had traditionally been poor at obtaining informed consent for clinical trials. The drug itself, she said, was completely unproven.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an unsubstantiated use at the present in that there has been no suggestion that you can prevent somebody from contracting Covid-19 by giving them hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no proof of that at all.\u201d\n\u201cSo why we would be saying that we will undertake a first trial to look into that with Defence members, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right population to even be trying to attempt that.\u201d\nThe Senate inquiry into the mefloquine and tafenoquine trials said serious side-effects were rare and noted that the Defence inspector general had found some were \u201cconducted ethically and lawfully\u201d.\nDefence, acting on the recommendations of that inquiry, appointed an advocate for trial participants. The advocate role is designed to give ADF personnel a confidential mechanism to seek advice and support about clinical trials.\nThis latest trial is being conducted through the ADF\u2019s malaria and infectious diseases institute, in conjunction with the national medical countermeasures initiative at DMTC Ltd. It has received ethics approval and will be subject to the rules and regulations of the TGA, including rules around informed consent.\nProf Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician, has previously said he would be reluctant to have anti-malarials tested on him. \u201cIf I got Covid-19 tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t want any of those drugs being tested [on me],\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt could help with treatment, it could do nothing, or it could be very harmful, and at at the moment we don\u2019t know which of those statements are true.\u201d\n\u201cHydroxychloroquine is quite a worry for two reasons, including that people are already using it when there are marginal benefits for it, and people can take too high a dose and experience toxicity. So often, clinical trials give preliminary results that look promising but in doing the proper larger studies you realise not only that it doesn\u2019t work, but it does more harm than good.\u201d",

        "content": "Nick Farr-Jones is leading a concerted call for change at Rugby Australia, but shoring up the game\u2019s finances via TV rights is Raelene Castle\u2019s trump card\nThe letter sent to Rugby Australia by 11 disgruntled former Wallabies captains was more like a letter-bomb designed to blow up the administration of the national governing body \u2013 and it might just achieve its objective.\nFormer national team leaders \u2013 Nick Farr-Jones, George Gregan, Phil Kearns, Jason Little, Michael Lynagh, Rod McCall, Stephen Moore, Stirling Mortlock, Simon Poidevin, Nathan Sharpe and George Smith \u2013 co-signed an explosive letter calling for regime change at RA. The names of some former Wallabies captains such as John Eales, an ex-RA board member, were conspicuous by their absence.\nAccording to the ex-skippers, Australian rugby has lost its way in recent times because of poor administration and leadership.\n\u201cWe ask the current administration to heed our call and stand aside to allow the game to be transformed,\u201d the captains co-wrote, echoing a verse from Bob Dylan\u2019s revolutionary anthem, The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019.\nConspiracy theorists may like to point out the strong Fox Sports connection among some of the ex-captains, but it\u2019s understood the letter was instigated by Farr-Jones, a vocal critic of RA with no allegiance to the broadcaster. Farr-Jones is a former president of the NSWRU and Gregan sat on the RA board not so long ago, but for the most part the former captains do not wield any direct political power in the game. However, they are certainly influential.\nWhile the ex-skippers do not name any particular individual who should stand aside, the letter will add to the pressure on under-siege RA chief executive Raelene Castle and interim chairman Paul McLean, himself a former Wallabies captain. McLean responded to the letter by inviting the ex-captains to meet with the RA board to discuss their concerns. Quick! Get them inside the tent! Too late. The damage is done.\nThe letter reflects the dissatisfaction of a lot of stakeholders in Australian rugby about RA\u2019s performance on a whole range of issues from the Israel Folau saga, the Wallabies\u2019 disappointing performance at last year\u2019s World Cup and the posting of a $9.4m loss.\nIt is not just Castle who has come in for criticism. There have been calls from various commentators for the whole RA board to be sacked.\nThe former captains not only want the current leadership out, but they appear to know who they would like to see replace them. According to the ex-skippers, \u201ca number of highly experienced rugby and business leaders are standing by to mentor and lead\u201d.\nIs it possible that Kearns himself is among that number? Kearns ran unsuccessfully against Castle when she was appointed to the top job three years ago and there was recent speculation he was looking to succeed her, which he dismissed as just \u201cpaper talk.\u201d Maybe the former captains were referring to the likes of ex-RA CEO John O\u2019Neill, who has been linked to a potential rugby war cabinet to rescue the game from financial disaster, or Sydney University rugby patriarch David Mortimer?\nWhoever is \u201cstanding by\u201d to lead, the former captains did not really offer any solutions to rugby\u2019s problems other than calling for a \u201ccollaborative\u201d approach. The new vision must include a plan that creates a \u201cmuch-needed, sustainable commercial rugby business.\u201d You would think that was an obvious objective, but the former captains clearly believe there is a need for a change in leadership to achieve it.\nThe timing of the letter was intriguing to say the least. Castle and RA had just negotiated an interim pay deal with the Rugby Union Players Association which will see players sacrifice 60 per cent of their salaries to help the code survive the coronavirus crisis. The negotiation was a bit drawn out and acrimonious at times, but the deal got done, seemingly fair to both parties, and placed RA in a position to secure a $16m loan from World Rugby to keep the game afloat.\nCastle then announced her intention to resume broadcast negotiations and try to organise a resumption of play involving Trans-Tasman competition to regenerate revenue streams.\nIt would be fair to say that Castle\u2019s future at RA rests largely on her ability to secure a lucrative new broadcast deal, but some stakeholders in the game fear she may have already missed the opportunity.\nFox Sports\u2019 current $57m-a-year broadcast deal expires at the end of this year. When renegotiation talks started earlier this year, Fox Sports made a low initial offer of $20m a year. For the first time in the professional era, RA took the broadcast rights to open tender. There was speculation Optus might offer $30m a year for the broadcast rights, but never confirmed.\nRA\u2019s strategy was to create competitive tension between rival broadcasters to drive up the value of the TV rights. Initially, it seemed to work. Fox Sports reportedly made a substantially increased revised offer, which was also rejected. Fox Sports then pulled out of the bidding process. It has been reported that Castle was just a week away from finalising a deal with Optus when the virus forced Super Rugby into shut down last month.\nIn hindsight, if RA had accepted Fox Sport\u2019s improved offer, the game would be in a much stronger position going forward. Presumably, Castle will now go back to Optus to see if they are still interested, but what if they are not? Will Fox Sports negotiate with the current administration?\nIf RA fails to deliver a satisfactory broadcast deal, there will be more than just 11 former Wallabies captains writing nasty letters to them.",

Guardian Australia understands his case is likely to be \u201cthe first of many\u201d.\nInfectious diseases experts, peak medical bodies, and the Australian Human Rights Commissioner have separately called for the numbers of people held in detention to be urgently reduced, with some warning detention centres risk spreading Covid-19 like cruise ships, and pose a risk to the broader community.\nThe government\u2019s own Department of Health identifies people held in detention as among those \u201cmost at risk\u201d of contracting Covid-19, and those with chronic illnesses at highest risk of serious illness if they are infected.\nThe refugee who has launched the high court action arrived in Australia seeking asylum in 2013, and was sent to Manus Island. His well-founded fear of persecution was recognised and he is legally owed protection.\nHe was brought from Papua New Guinea to Australia for medical treatment in early 2019, and has been detained ever since.\nThe man, who is middle-aged, has multiple and complex medical conditions \u2013 including diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure \u2013 that doctors argue put him at greater risk of serious illness or death if he is infected by the coronavirus.\nHe is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Australian government is breaching its duty of care to him by failing to establish conditions that allow him to comply with public health guidelines to practice social distancing and protect himself from Covid-19.\nNearly 1,400 women and men are currently held in immigration detention centres in Australia, or \u201calternative places of detention\u201d, usually hotels commandeered by the Department of Home Affairs.\nPeople in detention eat in crowded food halls, share bathrooms and communal spaces and are sleeping in rooms with up to six people.\nThey are also exposed to a wider circle of people by guards and other staff who come in and out of the centres daily.\nProtests are being held daily at places of detention.\nPeaceful #refugees protest (#Day17) in Brisbane #APOD at Kangaroo Point detention centre over #COVID19 infection fears. Video supplied (18.04.20) #auspol #qldpol #coronavirus #Manus #Nauru | @SBSNews pic.twitter.com/P63tHRUvbI\nThe case has been lodged in the high court because the man\u2019s detention falls under the Migration Act, but the court may choose to have the case transferred to the federal court for adjudication.\nGuardian Australia understands there are several further legal challenges being prepared on similar grounds. The man\u2019s case may act as a test for others currently held in detention.\nDavid Burke, the legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said home affairs minister Peter Dutton had a legal duty to protect the people in the government\u2019s care in immigration detention.\n\u201cInstead, he is choosing to hold men and women in crammed detention centres that make it impossible to practice physical distancing.\u201d\nBurke said medical experts had been consistent that people held in detention, especially those with underlying health issues, were at severe risk from Covid-19.\n\u201cWe are asking minister Dutton to listen to the medical experts \u2013 just like the government is asking all of us to do \u2013 in response to this public health crisis. He can avoid placing lives at risk by simply releasing people into safe housing where they can socially isolate.\u201d\nLawyers will argue that putting detainees into solitary confinement is an inappropriate solution and inhumane. Many of those in detention have histories of torture and trauma and solitary confinement would be damaging to their mental health.\nMany held in immigration detention have families living in the Australian community. Supporters, friends and advocates have offered to house others.\nOther countries, including the UK, Belgium, and Spain, have significantly reduced the number of people held in immigration detention out of concerns over potential Covid-19 outbreaks.\nFears have previously been raised about a Covid-19 outbreak in detention after a guard at a Brisbane hotel being used to hold detainees tested positive for the illness.\nA spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs said there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the detained populations of the broader detention network. He said Australian Border Force was focused on the health and safety of detainees and staff.\n\u201cIf clinically indicated, detainees will be isolated and tested in line with advice from the Department of Health and the broader commonwealth response,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA range of measures have been introduced to keep detainees and staff informed of preventive measures and plans have been established to manage any suspected cases of Covid-19.\u201d",

It started off with \u2018I have no money for food\u2019, but it\u2019s moving into \u2018I have no money for rent, my power, firewood, winter clothing\u2019 and the list just gets longer and longer,\u201d said Lieutenant Andrew Wilson from the Salvation Army.\n\u201cMany migrants cannot return home, either because their country is in total lockdown or they do not have the resources to pay for flights.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had one case where the individual was made redundant two weeks before the level-four lockdown. They had booked flights to return to their home country but their flight was cancelled at the last minute. They are now stuck here with no means of returning home but is still required to pay for rent and outgoings.\u201d\nImmigration New Zealand is involved in assisting some migrants, and the Salvation Army said it had the ability to \u201cmake sure these people don\u2019t go hungry\u201d but larger costs such as getting home, rent and bills were of major concern.\nLanguage barriers had also been \u201ca significant issue\u201d, and a number of families now had police and social services involved after lockdown domestic violence incidents, with some families having to be split up for safety reasons.\nAnu Kaolti from the Migrant Workers Association described the situation as a \u201cpowder keg\u201d, and said there was great frustration among migrants that they couldn\u2019t get government help \u2013 or get home.\n\u201cWe have been inundated with contact from migrants confused and looking for help,\u201d said Kaloti, adding that many migrants were fired at the beginning of the lockdown.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really dire and desperate circumstances that are beyond anyone\u2019s control. People are still holding it together but the pressures are there, I don\u2019t know how much longer they\u2019ll be able to hold on.\u201d\nQueenstown was looking at a minimum of a one-year economic downturn, with tourist numbers set to plummet as bans on foreign arrivals are in place.\nThe goal now was to get as many migrants returned to their home countries as possible.\nWilson said: \u201cThe best-case scenario is for the migrants to return home, or into alternative employment somewhere else in the country, but that\u2019s still a long way off.\u201d\nQueenstown District Lakes mayor Jim Boult has described the situation as an \u201cunprecedented welfare crisis\u201d and said he expected the 5,000 applications for welfare assistance to rise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost too big to comprehend,\u201d Boult told the local paper. \u201cI have been speaking regularly with central government to emphasise the importance of supporting our migrant workers, who will be essential to our ultimate recovery and the future diversification of our economy.\u201d\nAround the country food banks and welfare services say they are experiencing demand that they would usually only see around Christmas, and many families were surviving on basic foods such as baked beans and porridge.",

Qantas has already confirmed it will use jobkeeper to pay down leave.\nThe industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, amended draft legislation so employees must retain at least two weeks annual leave, but defended the employer practice.\nPorter said the jobkeeper scheme helps \u201cthe employee stay engaged to their employer [and helps] the employer pay their employee\u201d.\n\u201cWhether someone is at work doing limited hours because there\u2019s very little business left at the work, or whether they\u2019ve taken leave, what the government has said is we\u2019re going to save that business and help that employee by subsidising their wage \u2013 whether that\u2019s diminished hours at work or on leave with a $1,500 payment,\u201d he said.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nOn Tuesday Scott Morrison was asked about the potential for exploitation of employees, either by employers threatening to sack them if they asked for the jobkeeper payment or unreasonable directions to work to earn the $750 weekly payment.\nMorrison said he would be \u201cconcerned about any behaviour by employers that was coercive\u201d and suggested a threat could be referred to regulators such as the Fair Work Commission or Ombudsman.\nMorrison said employers were entitled to direct employees to work to do $750 of work a week at their regular rate of pay.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the Act provides for,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. \u201cThat is not an unreasonable request that someone would work the hours that they are being paid for, that is being paid by the employer but obviously that is being met by the commonwealth through the JobKeeper program.\u201d",

Sometimes his shows of empathy rang hollow, as when local leaders and victims\u2019 families shunned him on his visit to Pittsburgh following a 2018 synagogue shooting.\nBut Trump has especially fallen short as consoler-in-chief during the coronavirus crisis, analysts say, failing day after day to muster expressions of sympathy for victims and their families as the death toll in America increased into the tens of thousands.\nAnd in the current crisis, Trump\u2019s failure to grasp the scale of the American tragedy on a human level could do more than fuel emotional turmoil \u2013 it could cost more lives, according to historians, public affairs experts and political analysts interviewed by the Guardian.\nInstead of weighing the human costs attached to decisions about whether to reopen the economy or rush medical equipment to certain states, analysts said, Trump seems to be thinking about something else: his own political future and his need for the economy to rebound quickly if he is to be re-elected in November.\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said Trump\u2019s emotional blindspots during the coronavirus crisis could hinder his policymaking.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not sharing the feelings and demonstrating the capacity to understand what\u2019s going on in the hospitals, what\u2019s going on in quarantined bedrooms and homes, and why people are not just frightened but devastated \u2026 if he\u2019s not able to have real empathy for someone who had someone die and was not be able to see them, then he\u2019s not going to be sensitive to why scientists are saying, \u2018Don\u2019t open up too quickly,\u2019\u201d Zelizer said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just not thinking of those kinds of costs. And so his lack of empathy is directly linked to his kind of rush to reopen the economy, which in another president\u2019s hands might seem very different.\u201d\nUnlike most national disasters, the coronavirus emergency is not a discrete event that concludes abruptly with a price tag attached for total damages, or a summary death toll.\nThe coronavirus crisis is malleable, analysts said, and can be made bigger or smaller, longer or shorter, by how the White House responds, and by how the president encourages tens of millions of people to act. Epidemiological models portray how reopening the country too soon would lead to additional waves of infections, and many more deaths.\nBut the message Trump delivers each day in press briefings seems to be motivated more by his quest for re-election than any fellow feeling for beleaguered Americans, said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist.\n\u201cThe Trump people feel, and they may be right, that his re-election prospects are dependent on a thriving economy,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s imperative for his re-election that the economy open again.\u201d\nTrump often makes reference in his daily press briefings to the death toll in the US, which at about 45,000 represents about one-quarter of coronavirus deaths worldwide. But apart from some narrowly scripted remarks delivered in an uninterested monotone, Trump fails, day after day, to deliver expressions of sympathy for the loss of life, which remains on a grim trajectory. Instead his press briefings are more marked by attacks on opponents, whether Democrats, the media, China or the World Health Organization.\n\u201cHe makes attempts at it usually when he\u2019s reading prepared remarks, then he makes attempts at [empathy],\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut frankly, he\u2019s not very good at it, and he can\u2019t sustain it. The minute he goes off script, he\u2019s back to that pile of accusations, insecurities, false statements, and attacks.\u201d\nKamarck agreed that Trump\u2019s inability to muster human empathy hindered his ability to respond effectively to the crisis. \u201cIf you really are feeling people\u2019s pain, then you really are concentrating on how to help them,\u201d she said.\nPast presidents from both parties have responded to tragedies with expressions of sympathy and regret that historians credit with aiding the national recovery.\nAfter the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986, Ronald Reagan delivered a subdued Oval Office address paying tribute to the courage of the lost crew and addressing their families: \u201cWe cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we\u2019re thinking about you so very much.\u201d\nAt a memorial to victims of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 including 19 children, Bill Clinton delivered a personal speech addressing the families of victims: \u201cThough we share your grief, your pain is unimaginable, and we know that.\u201d\nBarack Obama sang Amazing Grace during a eulogy for a black minister killed by a white supremacist during a church massacre in Charleston in 2015.\nBut in his daily press briefings, Trump has largely left such condolences to his devoutly religious vice-president, Mike Pence. \u201cDespite the heartbreaking losses, we\u2019re getting there, America,\u201d Pence said on Wednesday.\nKamarck said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to draw the contrast between Trump and Reagan, which is stark enough. All you have to do every day is to draw the contrast between Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\u201d\nThe press briefings range across topics far and wide, but the main theme for Trump is touting an economic resurgence that awaits if only a rotating cast of villains would stop sabotaging the White House, and the country.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be the comeback kids \u2013 all of us,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cWe want to get our country back. We\u2019re going to do it, and we\u2019re going to do it soon.\u201d\nBut even when Trump talks about economic suffering, Zelizer noted, he doesn\u2019t evoke the individual suffering and fears of the newly unemployed, people facing food shortages, and workers wondering when their relief checks will land.\n\u201cI could imagine other presidents talking about the urgency of getting back to normal for workers, schoolchildren,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cBut you can only do that if you really convey a feeling for why this has been so devastating, beyond everything shutting down.\u201d\nInstead, when Trump discusses the economic impact of the crisis, he is, once again, mostly talking about himself \u2013 and specifically his re-election prospects, said Bannon.\n\u201cI think Trump\u2019s going to keep doing everything he can to get the economy open, because that\u2019s basically the only hope he has to be re-elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that he was too late to recognize the crisis, and he was too early in wishing it away.\u201d",

        "content": "Amphibians are at the forefront of a battle against extinction \u2013 but they\u2019re not the only ones benefiting from \u2018frozen zoos\u2019 \nOlaf grasps Diane Barber\u2019s gloved hands with his sticky, four-fingered legs. His skin is bumpy and moist, the colour of pebbles at the bottom of a river when dappled sun hits them. Olaf\u2019s eyes are deep amber. His body lifts and falls with each breath. \u201cThe males get really pretty,\u201d says Barber, ectotherms curator at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll turn a solid yellow when they\u2019re in breeding form.\u201d\nIn some ways, this toad shouldn\u2019t exist at all. He is the progeny of an egg from a captive mother and sperm from a wild father \u2013 a hybrid from parents who were both dead. Olaf is not the first amphibian to be born via IVF \u2013 that has been happening for years \u2013 but he is the first of his species to be born from sperm that was frozen and thawed.\n\u201cWe were able to recover a genetic lineage that had disappeared, so we were able to produce an offspring from dead parents,\u201d says Andy Kouba, an ecologist at Mississippi State University, who assisted with the project. \u201cSo that was an exciting first, to reintroduce genetic lines back into the population.\u201d\nScientists have a lot of tools to conserve species, says Kouba, but they still need to hedge against extinction in the wild. One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring.\nAmphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. The IUCN estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss, climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise.\nBut amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies. In vitro fertilisation, hormone therapy and cryopreservation are increasingly being used as tools for conservation \u2013 for amphibians and beyond. In a fast-changing world, frozen zoos may be the places where tissues are kept, in the hope of boosting numbers or resurrecting species in the future.\nHow did Olaf come to exist at all? A year ago in Puerto Rico, researchers captured six male toads, injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans, but the researchers also barked at them, Kouba explains, as toads urinate when frightened, and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild.\nThe team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to Fort Worth zoo, where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish, eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs.\nThe idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s, when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material, no technology existed to make use of it, but he believed it was important to carry on anyway.\nNow, biobanks for animal species \u2013 from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs \u2013 are popping up around the globe. The Frozen Zoo repository at San Diego zoo holds more than 10,000 cell cultures from nearly 1,000 different species. They are mostly from mammals, but also from birds, reptiles and amphibians.\nScientists had been working on the process of bringing together sperm and egg outside the bodies of animals like rabbits and guinea pigs since the 1870s. But making babies in a test tube is no simple task because every species is different. IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles, and with some species, it\u2019s incredibly low. Even within species, some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians, Kouba says, their sperm is pretty simple to freeze \u2013 but eggs are not, because they are so much larger than the sperm. \u201cInside that cell, you have water content, and when you start to freeze anything with water, they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.\u201d\nBecause fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially, they have been studied much more than amphibians, and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. \u201cThere is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species,\u201d Kouba says.\nOne reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species, but that it is really better to take action before a species\u2019 numbers have crashed. \u201cWe can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction, which may allow a species to return to a healthy population,\u201d he says.\nThat\u2019s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate, so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. \u201cYou release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop, and those animals will reproduce,\u201d says Kouba.\nIn Colorado, Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can\u2019t do is move around the globe \u2013 so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF.\nUsing assisted reproductive technologies, she has helped produce healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.\nThere is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. \u201cBio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea, like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.\u201d\nShe says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don\u2019t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. \u201cYou can\u2019t experiment on endangered species,\u201d says Barfield.\nIn some species, assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world, both female, both past reproductive age. Last year, researchers were able to harvest eggs from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen, with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa \u2013 a plan that could take decades to come to fruition.\nBack at Fort Worth zoo, Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild, Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks, coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo, the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room, 193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America, all in need of a population boost.\nBarber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. \u201cThat was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we\u2019re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.\u201d\nBut those arks are full, and more species need assistance \u2013 there\u2019s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. \u201cWe\u2019re not arks, we\u2019re life rafts,\u201d Barber says. \u201cAnd we have very limited seating.\u201d\nAs she speaks about her passion for overlooked species, Barber\u2019s eyes fill with emotion. \u201cEspecially with the stuff that I work with \u2013 the creepy crawlies \u2013 most people wonder: why should we care? And it\u2019s like, well, we should care about everything because we\u2019re all connected. Sometimes it\u2019s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.\u201d\nSo far, IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species \u2013 but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to become mainstream,\u201d he says, adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. \u201cWe left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material, bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population, so we don\u2019t need to remove animals from the wild any more.\n\u201cThat will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.\u201d\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

        "content": "For many the inability to pray and eat together will be keenly felt, while others are carrying on regardless\nMosques will be deserted, daylong fasts will be broken in isolation and in some places the calls to prayer that rally believers together will end with a different exhortation: worship from where you are.\nOrdinarily during Ramadan, the holy month that commences this week, Muslim community life swells with special prayers at mosques and crowded iftar dinners that can stretch into the early hours.\nBut that kind of socialising now risks spreading coronavirus, and bans on religious and family gatherings will persist across much of the Islamic world even as businesses and government offices start to reopen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult and depressing,\u201d said Mohammad Faoury, who works for a refugee organisation in Amman, Jordan. \u201cSince I\u2019m single and live alone, Ramadan is the month when I can finally see my family for extended periods of time. It\u2019s a time we strengthen the bond.\u201d\nThe virus has emptied Islam\u2019s holiest sites at the most sacred time of year. The Ka\u2019bah, the gold-embroidered shrine in Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque, is closed to worshippers along with the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Medina and Jerusalem\u2019s al-Aqsa mosque.\n\u201cOur hearts are tortured from pain in the holy month of Ramadan,\u201d said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswami, the imam and director of al-Aqsa, where only guards and mosque employees will be permitted to pray. \u201cIt is a very sad moment in the history of Islam.\u201d\nJamia Masjid, one of the oldest and grandest mosques in the disputed south Asian territory of Kashmir, usually overflows in the evenings with people gathering for prayer and discussing religion, politics and life. This month it will sit silent for the first time in living memory.\n\u201cIn Ramadan I would pray all five times of the day at Jamia and would also do iftar there, but this time it is a matter of life and death,\u201d said Fatima, 74, from Srinagar. \u201cThere is danger outside and the best thing is to stay home, stay quiet.\u201d\nIndonesia has banned mudik, an annual homecoming in which tens of millions of people travel to see their families for Eid-al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the fasting month.\nAcross Israel and Palestine, mosques \u2013 as well as churches and synagogues \u2013 have been closed. Abdullah Abu Galous, a 38-year-old hardware shop owner from the Palestinian city of Ramallah, said it felt as if Ramadan had been cancelled.\n\u201cI would never have thought that a tiny virus could stop us from celebrating the month of Ramadan. It has held more than one billion Muslims throughout the world hostage,\u201d he said.\nAuthorities in Turkey have so far resisted calls for a total lockdown, insisting the wheels of the economy must keep turning. But Ramadan will be marked by a new four-day lockdown starting from Thursday night, during which families will not be able to travel to eat and celebrate together without risking fines or arrest.\nThe emergency has raised unprecedented issues for many of the religion\u2019s 1.8 billion adherents as they prepare to abstain from food and water during sunlight hours.\nSeveral Arab newspapers have carried expert assurances that fasting has not been shown to reduce resistance to the virus. Al-Azhar, Egypt\u2019s top Sunni mosque, said last week that coronavirus could not be used as an excuse not to participate unless it was scientifically established that drinking water helps to ward off the disease.\nLockdowns have curtailed the production schedules of some of the soap operas that are a staple of Ramadan evenings in many homes, leaving TV executives scrambling to fill airtime during their most lucrative advertising season.\nBut the inability to pray and eat together may be most keenly felt. In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain has encouraged people to hold virtual iftars on social media.\nMore than 1,400 people have signed up for nightly iftar broadcast of the call to prayer, and guest speakers are being organised over Zoom by the UK-based Ramadan Tent Project, with the option for viewers to split off into smaller group discussions. \u201cJust because you\u2019re in quarantine, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend Ramadan alone,\u201d said Rohma Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the project.\nAbu Ibrahim, 32, said he was keeping this year\u2019s difficulties in perspective. In 2011 he observed Ramadan under airstrikes in Dara\u2019a, southern Syria. The following year he spent the first day of the month dodging Syrian army patrols to escape on foot to Jordan.\n\u201cPeople say, how are we going to get through this Ramadan when we can\u2019t see each other, when there\u2019s a health risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to put food on the table and hear the sound of bombing. We were scared of death, of our families dying. Coronavirus doesn\u2019t worry me. I\u2019m in my house, with my family, we\u2019re safe, we have electricity, phones, food.\u201d\nFa\u2019ek Thyabat, the imam of Bab Al-Rayan mosque in Amman, said the Qu\u2019ran did not explicitly guide worshippers on how to observe Ramadan during a plague, leaving worshippers to navigate the uncharted territory with reference to the wider tradition.\n\u201cThere is a hadith [a prophetic saying] that says: \u2018If you hear of a plague in a land, then do not go into it. If it happens in a land where you are, then do not go out of it,\u2019\u201d Thyabat said.\n\u201cSimilarly, if we know that Muslims who eat garlic and onion are advised not to go to mosques because the bad breath will hurt mosquegoers, it is easy to conclude that you cannot go to the mosque when there is the risk of spreading contagious disease.\u201d\nIn a faith without formal hierarchies, not all Islamic leaders share Thyabat\u2019s interpretation. Hundreds of worshippers continue to turn out for prayers in Herat, Afghanistan, where a hardline preacher, Mujib Rahman Ansari, recently advised his followers that death from coronavirus was a form of martyrdom.\nIn neighbouring Pakistan, the government has compromised with clerics by lifting a ban on group prayers during Ramadan on condition that no carpet is laid, children and older people stay away and worshippers wear masks and keep six feet apart.\nMaulvi Haider Zaman, a prayer leader in Islamabad, said coronavirus was \u201cnot an issue\u201d and insisted it was important people still came to offer prayers during Ramadan.\n\u201cPeople are not afraid to perform their prayers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be imposing social distancing in the mosque but I don\u2019t think it is needed as coronavirus will not affect people in mosques. It\u2019s the home of Allah.\u201d\nIn Jordan, Thyabat said he was instructing worshippers to focus on the upsides. Ramadan in past years had been an occasion for increasingly lavish iftar feasts and shopping bonanzas, he said. \u201cThis Ramadan is an opportunity for people to re-adopt the real spirit of fasting, which is about austerity and helping relatives and needy people.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Sufian Taha, Jassar Al-Tahat, Shah Meer Baloch, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii and a reporter in Srinagar",

Asked whether senior political figures were among those sent the memoir, CEO says, \u2018How senior do you want?\u2019 \nSome of the biggest names in politics will be drawn into the controversy over pirating of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s autobiography after his publisher reached a settlement on the issue.\nOn Tuesday evening Hardie Grant reached a settlement with Scott Morrison\u2019s adviser Nico Louw over claims he distributed unauthorised copies of Turnbull\u2019s book, A Bigger Picture, before its formal release on Monday.\n\u201cAn undisclosed sum was settled for and he\u2019s given us where he got [the digital copy] from and where it went to,\u201d the chief executive of the publishing house, Sandy Grant, told Guardian Australia Wednesday.\n\u201cAnd we are going to pursue those really aggressively now because there\u2019s quite a lot at stake frankly. The number of copies that have gone out is ridiculous.\u201d\nThe publisher declined to disclose the number of people on the Louw list but at the weekend Turnbull suggested there were 59 direct recipients. That did not include anyone who might have received it in turn from them.\nGrant declined to give a number but said, \u201cThey are legion.\u201d\nHe later used the figure of 20,000 in another context.\nHe declined to identify any recipients, but asked whether senior figures were involved, replied: \u201cHow senior do you want?\u201d\nGrant said: \u201cAnd people in the Liberal party were gleefully sending it around.\n\u201cWe are going to ask if they have deleted or destroyed it and to tell us anyone they have sent it on to. They are legion.\u201d\nThat was underlined on Wednesday morning when the ABC presenter Patricia Karvelas told her audience she had received five copies.\nAsked on Wedneday whether the prime minister had received an unauthorised copy, and if so what he had done with it, a spokesman for Morrison said: \u201cThese are legal matters, therefore we cannot comment at this stage.\u201d\nMinisters have already admitted they were sent copies. On Sunday the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said on the ABC\u2019s Insiders she had deleted the item without reading it. She declined to reveal the source.\nOthers who have acknowledged being sent the book include the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, who said a friend sent him a copy on WhatsApp and that he also deleted it.\nThe leak of the book was initially seen as a bit of mischief by Liberals who were not big fans of Turnbull when he was prime minister.\nBut the publishing industry sees it as an example of a copyright infringement which is damaging to their finances and survival.\nGrant pointed to the government\u2019s recent action against the social media giant Facebook based on the principle it should not use newspaper content without paying for it.\n\u201cMeanwhile the Liberal party don\u2019t seem to believe that at all if it doesn\u2019t suit them.\u201d\nHe said copyright breach was potentially a criminal offence and that the Australian federal police had been asked to investigate the Turnbull case.\n\u201cIf someone was running around pulling them out of bookshops they might do something. There would be 20,000 shoplifting charges,\u201d Grant said.\nMalcolm Turnbull said on Wednesday that publishers were concerned that \u201cdigital piracy, which is theft\u201d, \u201cundermines their whole business\u201d.\n\u201cIt undermines Australian jobs, you know, particularly at a time like this when bookshops and publishers are struggling to survive to have copies of a book \u2014 any book \u2014... being widely circulated,\u201d he said in a virtual National Press Club lunch recorded on Tuesday.\nTurnbull suggested people were familiar with the piracy of copyright material.\n\u201cIn some respects, I think the illegal file sharing of music by platforms like Napster years ago, in many people\u2019s minds, normalised this practice,\u201d he said on the recording broadcast Wednesday.\nHe said ending piracy was life and death for publishers, as it is for the music, film and television industries.\nThe controversy erupted on Saturday when Turnbull was alerted to the unauthorised distribution of his book. A Liberal MP told Turnbull he had received five copies and a journalist had six.\nA notice of complaint was sent to Louw on Saturday by lawyers representing the publishers.\nIt said the instruction was that Louw was \u201cresponsible for unauthorised distribution of my client\u2019s book\u201d in digital form.\n\u201cIt occurred on a massive scale,\u201d the lawyers said in an email and text message.\nOn Sunday a spokesman for Morrison said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s office will not comment on legal proceedings.\n\u201cStaff have been reminded of their obligations under copyright law, and of the high standards of conduct expected of them.\u201d\nLouw has been contacted for comment.",

As a wee boy in Cambuslang, I was sent up to bed while it was still light. Confined to my room, I half believed the bird outside my window was singing for me. Even now, I catch a yearning in its voice that reminds me of the self-pitying child lamenting the curtailment of playtime.\nThis is nonsense, of course. I doubt there is anything elegiac or mournful in this blackbird\u2019s last post from the topmost tip of the high spruce tree. He is the territory-proclaiming bookend at both ends of the day. I heard him before I was awake, and he is heralding the night.\nFor this bird, height comes before a fall. He picked an upright that can\u2019t quite carry his weight. It bends, he sways. He lifts his wings a little to steady himself and flicks them again. His body rocks, his tail balances, almost. Nevertheless, his throat rises above any physical discomfort down below, maintaining the melody, the far-carrying sounds that warn off all who listen.\nIt is a feat of great vocal dexterity, two tympanic membranes working simultaneously to produce notes that can be sustained for half a second. And a blackbird rarely forgets. Every spring, it adds to its repertoire and, judging by its range, I would say this male has a few years under its wing.\nEventually, the bough buckles once too often and the blackbird is sprung off to seek another perch. He won\u2019t try for the even higher limes, the pinnacles of the neighbourhood, for two carrion crows sit dominant, black against a blackening sky.\nMy own world is bounded by fences, for I have already taken my permitted walk of the day. But I am liberated by curiosity. The bare patch of earth at the pond\u2019s edge has grown no bigger and the scatter of damp soil tossed out from a plantless trough has not been added to for about a week. This male\u2019s female, having lined the bowl of her nest with a plaster of mud, must now be incubating. And so the male sings: my patch, my mate, my babies.",

When the coronavirus shutdown closed all fertility clinics, she had been waiting for \u201covarian drilling\u201d, a surgical treatment that can trigger ovulation in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. \u201cIf St Mary\u2019s goes private we will be up a creek with no paddle, as finances aren\u2019t great at the moment so we were relying on NHS funding for treatment,\u201d she said.\nShe added: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s is the oldest NHS IVF clinic, they can\u2019t privatise it. What about NHS patients who cannot afford treatment? That\u2019s discriminatory to myself as that\u2019s saying NHS-funded patients shouldn\u2019t be able to get the chance of their rainbows at the end of a long road tackling treatment.\u201d\nLyndsey Dudley, who had her daughter, Nora, via IVF at St Mary\u2019s last year after six years of trying to conceive, said: \u201cAnyone who argues against the funding of fertility treatment has never felt the pain and destruction of infertility. Maybe it\u2019s not a case of IVF being a life-saving treatment, and the staff at St Mary\u2019s don\u2019t have your life in their hands. But IVF, for those who want to have children but can\u2019t, is life \u2018making\u2019 and the staff at St Mary\u2019s hold your dreams and future in their hands. At our most vulnerable they helped us believe and we trusted them 100%.\u201d\nShe and her husband moved to Stockport in Greater Manchester in order to access two NHS-funded cycles of IVF after discovering that they would only be entitled to one in their native Derbyshire because of the \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d of NHS fertility treatment. \u201cIt kills me to think that others won\u2019t be as lucky as we have been,\u201d she said. \u201cThe staff are incredible, they got us through the darkest times.\u201d\nOther patients contacted by the Guardian said they wanted clarity on what would happen to their eggs, sperm or embryos currently in storage at St Mary\u2019s.\nThe hospital site has already been promised to Manchester Science Partnerships to be turned into a \u00a360m healthcare business centre called Citylabs 3.0.\nManchester University NHS foundation trust, which runs St Mary\u2019s, said no decisions had been made about the future of the clinic and it would not comment pending the outcome of any review into the service.\nGwenda Burns, chief executive of the Fertility Network, said patients were rightfully concerned: \u201cThe news of the potential closure of the department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s is extremely worrying. Not only to patients who are due to begin treatment but for current patients who have either embryos, eggs or sperm stored at the unit,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWith no apparent information being shared with patients about these plans or indeed if this could have any impact on treatment provision, it is with urgency that we would ask for clarity as soon as possible.\u201d\nIn England, the proportion of fertility treatment funded by the NHS dropped from 39% in 2012 to 35% in 2017, according to figures published last year by the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. This is at odds with the rest of the UK, where public funding has remained stable or increased.",

Last week, the government announced a three-month advertising partnership with the embattled newspaper industry which has been valued at \u00a335m to \u00a345m.\nTalks last week with John Whittingdale, a minister in the culture department, have focused on using the Community Radio Fund, a \u00a3400,000 funding pot administered by Ofcom. However, that would amount to less than \u00a31,500 in support on average per station.\n\u201cWe are extremely concerned that the government will allow up to one-third, by our own estimates, of the UK\u2019s 296 community radio stations to fail,\u201d said Danny Lawrence, of Gateway 97.8FM and chairman of the CMA. \u201cA relatively small amount of additional funding for the community radio sector will go a long way to support stations keeping their communities connected and informed during the crisis.\u201d\nThe CMA pointed to some examples of hardship and diversity in community radio including Belfast\u2019s Raidio Failte, which broadcasts in Irish Gaelic, which has seen its lifeblood of advertising and events revenue \u201cfall off the edge of a cliff\u201d.\nDerrick Francis, director of Gloucester FM, which mainly serves the city\u2019s Afro-Caribbean community, says there is a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d the station will have to close. Meanwhile, East Leeds FM has been set up with a temporary 84-day licence authorised by Ofcom under coronavirus conditions, to broadcast to over-70s who don\u2019t use the internet and other technology.\nThe CMA will pitch a three-pronged plan to ministers to support community radio.\nThe first is an equivalent to the newspaper industry initiative, where the government is paying for public health messaging to appear as ads in national and regional newspapers. The second is to increase the Community Radio Fund to provide a \u00a310,000 grant to each licensed community radio station. The third is to establish a public health content fund to support the production of news, programmes and series relating to the public health emergency.\n\u201cI hope we will not have to wait until the public enquiry to find out why the government thinks our audiences are less important than those of the local press,\u201d said Steve Buckley, chairman of station Sheffield Live.",

        "content": "Up to \u00a37bn owed for trips cancelled because of coronavirus - but operators fear bankruptcy if they pay out\nAll of the UK\u2019s biggest airlines and most big holiday companies are systematically breaking the law by denying timely refunds to customers for travel cancelled during the pandemic, researchers have found.\nConsumer groups have warned that the sector risks permanently losing public confidence in booking travel, with Which? finding 20 of the UK\u2019s largest operators are illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within 14 days.\nMost have instead offered vouchers or credit notes, and customers have complained they have been unable to obtain refunds online or get through to make a claim on the phone.\nOn Monday Ryanair started telling its customers that they will have to wait until \u201cthe COVID-19 emergency has passed\u201d if they want a refund for a cancelled flight. Initially, the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking.\nAccording to the travel industry\u2019s own estimates, up to \u00a37bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However, industry bodies such as Iata, for airlines, and Abta, for travel firms, say firms would be bankrupted by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue.\nConfidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday that he would not book a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely.\nWhich?, the consumer association, said 20 of the UK\u2019s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips, and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed.\nHowever, it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene, recognising that firms were under \u201cunprecedented strain\u201d and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately.\nWhile Which? said consumers\u2019 legal right to cash refunds should be protected, it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days, and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings, and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions, to help restore confidence.\nWhich? researchers found 10 of the UK\u2019s biggest holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days, with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier.\nIt also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time, with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints.\nSome carriers, such as Air France and KLM, have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed, issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was \u201ca fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face\u201d.\nPassengers booking with carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have told the Guardian they have been unable to obtain refunds. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue. BA and easyJet customers have complained that call centre numbers are not being answered.\nA spokesperson for Airlines UK said: \u201cAirlines are facing unprecedented challenges keeping vital routes open to repatriate stranded British travellers and transport critical medical supplies and PPE as part of cargo operations. Carriers are facing a far longer than usual volume of refund claims to get through and the current restrictions imposed nationally mean they are not able to bring in additional staff to deal with them. We are thankful to passengers for their continued patience.\u201d\nRory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: \u201cWe do not want to see the industry suffer further as a result of this outbreak, but it cannot be on consumers to prop up airlines and travel firms, especially when so many will be in difficult financial situations of their own.\n\u201cThe government must urgently set out how it will support travel firms and airlines to ensure they can meet their legal obligations to refund customers for cancelled travel plans, and avoid permanent damage to trust and confidence in the travel industry.\u201d\nSome governments have already amended consumer legislation to allow deferred refunds, after calls from the airline body Iata. The Iata director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said earlier this month that refunding was \u201calmost unbearable, financially speaking\u201d, adding that airlines were \u201cperfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger \u2026 but it is a matter of survival\u201d.\nAbta said tour operators were being squeezed by refund requests for money that had been paid to suppliers, such as airlines and hotels, and not returned. Its chief executive, Mark Tanzer, said: \u201cThe UK government, despite repeated requests, has failed to recognise and respond to this reality, in stark contrast to the clear sensible actions taken by the European commission and many countries throughout Europe.\n\u201cWe fully understand and sympathise with the frustration that many customers may be feeling. But if companies are forced into bankruptcy, it will not only destroy livelihoods but extend the refund delays far beyond the term of refund credit notes.\u201d",

Last week it was celebrating three days with no new cases, with buildings in Taipei lit up with the word \u201czero\u201d.\nThen on Saturday health officials announced three new diagnoses of Covid-19. All were military personnel from the supply ship Panshi which was sent on a \u201cgoodwill\u201d mission to the Pacific Island nation of Palau. On Sunday they added 22 cases \u2013 including 21 from the ship. On Monday, another three.\nMore than 700 sailors from the mission have now been recalled into quarantine and authorities have contacted more than 200,000 Taiwanese people by text message, to alert anyone who may have been in contact with them after the ship was disembarked.\nThe ship stopped at Palau \u2013 one of just 15 countries which recognise Taiwan as an independent nation \u2013 for three days in mid-March. Palau\u2019s government says they still have no cases in the country, making it unlikely the sailors picked up the virus there.\nIt returned to port on 9 April, with the crew remaining on board for just six days under local quarantine requirements. Three days after everyone disembarked \u2013 without health screenings, according to the defence minister \u2013 24 crew tested positive for the virus.\nIn the three days between disembarking and being recalled, it is estimated the sailors visited more than 90 locations across 10 counties, including restaurants, trains, university campuses, temples, and sport centres.\nA map published by Taiwan\u2019s centres for disease control pinpoints the known locations infected sailors visited. Markings stretch the length of the island\u2019s west coast.\nThe cluster has prompted questions on why the fleet embarked on the goodwill mission during a pandemic.\nThe ministry of foreign affairs distanced itself from the scandal, saying the decision to go ahead with the mission was made by the navy. Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the mission was an important regular event for the military and the navy.\nThe South China Morning Post reported military leadership told a government meeting last week there was no health issue among the crew on board, and then retracted it this week. According to the navy 148 officers had in fact presented to the ships doctors during the 45-day mission, five with fever and 10 with respiratory problems.\nOpposition legislator Wu Sz-huai accused the military of a \u201cserious lapse in dealing with crisis\u201d.\nOn Monday the defence minister, Yen Teh-fa, apologised to the people of Taiwan, the affected soldiers and their families, for approving the mission and offered to resign. Senior Navy commanders would be reassigned, he said.\n\u201cThose who should be punished will be punished,\u201d he said.\nThe itinerary of the ship was not clear. Democratic Progressive party legislator, Wang Ting-yu, wrote on Facebook that the ship took 19 days to return because they stopped for \u201ca confidential mission\u201d.\n\u201cThey were not on vacation and people shouldn\u2019t be too harsh on the mission and the Navy,\u201d he said.",

Most have instead offered vouchers or credit notes. Ryanair has started telling customers they will have to wait until \u201cthe Covid-19 emergency has passed\u201d for a refund. Passengers booked with easyJet and British Airways have told the Guardian they could not get their money back. Which? says customers of holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are in a similar boat.

Downing Street has weighed in behind Hancock, who has been forced to deny explosive claims by a top civil servant that ministers made a political decision to opt out of bulk-buying ventilators and protective equipment with the EU. However, a spokesman for the European commission rebutted a suggestion by Hancock that the UK had joined the EU group buy efforts, adding: \u201cThey are most welcome to participate in future rounds.\u201d The head of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium has said it made the right choice in deciding to boost production of existing models by collaborating with big manufacturers such as Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren \u2013 rather than trying to get new designs approved. The consortium has supplied 250 ventilators to hospitals, with \u201chundreds\u201d to follow this week and maximum output slated for early May.\nIn our latest global wrap: the prospect of a prolonged worldwide impact from the pandemic has hardened after business leaders warned of a drawn-out recession and US health chiefs highlighted the prospect of a second wave of cases there in winter.

They don\u2019t want to go to the supermarkets because they don\u2019t think they are safe.\u201d\nWelcome Stores, Southampton\nRichard Inglis runs three shops in Southampton but has already closed one after sales plummeted from \u00a330,000 a week to \u00a35,000 in just five days. His staff have been abused, and he has been spat at by shoplifters. Inglis says small shops can\u2019t afford the security personnel hired by the big supermarket chains.\nOver the past few weeks, a small group of drug users and street drinkers have started to hang round the front of his shop in front of the railway station daily. And they have become more sophisticated in their approach, he says.\n\u201cBefore, they used to come on their own, now they are coming in in teams wearing face masks, disguising their identity, and they will split up around the shop, grab whatever they can and make a dash for it. It\u2019s worrying for my staff who have got anxieties about the virus and then these people in swearing and threatening to spit at you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI got spat at in the face along with two of my staff by a woman the other week. She\u2019s still on the streets. The police came and she was arrested but she was released on bail,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe reality is if you shoplift, the biggest risk is you might be detained for 24 hours.\u201d\nShopsmart, Possilpark, Glasgow\nOmar Afzal runs the Shopsmart convenience store and post office on Saracen Street, north Glasgow and explains how people locally have adapted to the crisis.\nHe and his staff now wear PPE, and customers take their own precautions, such as handing over their bank card in a sealed plastic bag so they can disinfect it when they get home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very benefit-dependent area so people have not had a big shock to their income like other places. We didn\u2019t get panic-buying here, I think that was more of a middle-class thing,\u201d Afzal says.\nLike other similar shops, he adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge reduction in customer numbers but they tend to buy much more to keep them going.\u201d\nHe has now reduced the number of customers in the shop to three at a time, where they can browse three aisles selling everything from muesli to wrapping paper. People are buying more magazines and puzzle books now, as well as more vouchers for online gaming since the bookies closed.\nThe mood of shoppers is usually good-humoured, he adds. \u201cIn an area like this it\u2019s tough for people cooped up in flats and that can have an effect on mental health, so when people come out to the shop it\u2019s a change of scenery, especially for children.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that we\u2019re staying open for the money, but we\u2019re key workers and we have a sense of responsibility. We are financially invested in the area but also emotionally. I\u2019ve been here for 20 years and have seen people grow up.\u201d\nMarsh Hill News, Homerton, east London\nAnkit Patel has recently taken over this small convenience store close to the Kingsmead Estate in London. At the outset of the lockdown he had considered closing, but felt it was important to stay open so locals could continue to top up their Oyster travel cards and use the Payzone to pay their bills.\nSales have collapsed in the past few weeks, however, and he struggles to make ends meet. \u201cWe used to do 200-250 transactions a day. We\u2019ve been open since 7am and it\u2019s now 12.30am and we\u2019ve had 21 transactions,\u201d he told the Guardian last week, checking the till.\nPatel blames panicked stockpiling last month. \u201cPeople were panicking and they still have these things in their house, so they are only coming in here for milk and food,\u201d he said.\nHe is also witnessing hardship, with some customers offering to sell their phones and stolen goods. \u201cWe have people coming in to sell goods they have stolen from other shops, from supermarkets, not just groceries but things like jackets, bags,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYesterday we had six or seven people in trying to sell their phones because they have run out of money. These are our regular customers. People are struggling, especially people who had temporary zero-hours jobs, or some people who\u2026 are also carers for elderly or sick people and they have no job, they are desperate.\u201d\nPatel added that he was giving hard-up cases \u201ca bit of credit\u201d because he feels for them and he is part of the community.\nGeneral Merchants, Bettyhill, Scotland\nBettyhill\u2019s General Merchants is the only shop left open in the remote village of about 800 inhabitants on Scotland\u2019s far north coast.\nPerched above the spectacular dunes of Torrisdale Bay, the road outside is eerily quiet. The shop is on the A836, on the most northerly section of the popular North Coast 500 touring route, but for now traffic is occasional and local.\nThe owner of the convenience store and petrol station, Peter Malone, says he is still struggling to stock paracetamol after initial panic-buying. While locals still rely on the shop rather than making the 80-mile (130km) round trip to the nearest supermarket in Thurso, trade is down without the tourists. He is selling fewer sweets with no children dropping in after school, and local crofters are busy with lambing. But sales of butcher meat, bakery and milk are holding up.\nHe has seen a significant increase in demand for home delivery. Last Friday he made 16, compared with the usual three or four before the weekend. \u201cWe knock the door and leave the shopping outside. Older people might want some help carrying it, so we take it into their kitchen and clean behind us on the way out.\u201d\nMalone is used to the shop acting as a community hub, but this is made all the more apparent now in a village with a significant proportion of older residents. \u201cIt was always the case that we were the centre point, and people will tell us things that we then pass on. The mood in Bettyhill is fairly positive, most people are quite happy that we need to be in lockdown to protect the older population.\u201d\nOTG Afro Foods, Romford\nLola Otuagomah is gazing out of the large window in a blue mask watching the near-empty buses go by. His is a destination shop for African food lovers and most, he says, are now too afraid to take the bus to get to him.\n\u201cThe buses are passing by with just two or three people in them. You can see the place is empty,\u201d he says, gesturing around his mid-sized shop. \u201cBy this time usually [3pm] I have 60 to 100 customers, today I\u2019ve had eight to 10.\u201d\nHe points to the shelves of plastic containers of freshly cooked food including Waakye, fresh moin-moin, jollof rice and pepper soup. \u201cUsually these are already gone by now. I have only sold one today.\u201d\nHe is also afraid he will run out of stock as the lockdowns have meant supplies are not coming in of specialist milled grains, beans and nuts. \u201cIf the borders don\u2019t open again it will be very, very difficult,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Unions reject rule stripping lower paid heritage workers of final fifth of wages during crisis\nThe Treasury is seeking to block museums and art galleries from topping up the salaries of staff who have been furloughed under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme, the Guardian understands.\nOfficials in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been told that \u201carm\u2019s length bodies\u201d in the heritage sector, which receive some central funding, should hold on to any extra cash to deal with other cost pressures, instead of paying the 20% portion of staff salaries under the scheme.\nIt means that lower-paid workers in institutions such as the British Museum, Imperial War Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, which have been badly affected by Covid-19, could receive just 80% of their pay \u2013 the portion pledged by the government.\nThe job retention scheme, which opened on Monday, allows employers to furlough workers and claim back four-fifths of their salaries from the Treasury.\nWhen Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced the scheme, he said: \u201cOf course, employers can top up salaries further if they choose to.\u201d\nBut in an apparent contradiction of the chancellor\u2019s statement, the Treasury has told culture department officials that staff at some \u201cheritage\u201d institutions should not top up salaries. Museums and galleries generate up to 70% of their own income.\nJo Stevens, the shadow culture secretary, called for an explanation, saying that low-paid workers had to be supported through the crisis. \u201cThe chancellor was very clear when announcing this scheme that employers would be free to top up wages to 100% and that\u2019s the case no matter who the employer is. Government should urgently consider the impact of this on the lowest paid workers.\u201d\nThe implications of the Treasury\u2019s position were dire for many workers, union insiders said. A large percentage of museum staff earn living wage or a sum close to it.\nUnions have said they will not accept the furloughing of workers on 80% of salaries and will urge members to reject it too. The job retention scheme requires agreement before staff can be furloughed.\nAlan Leighton, national secretary of the union Prospect, said: \u201cThe government should be leading by example on topping up furloughed workers\u2019 wages. Instead the Treasury is blocking some employers from doing so even where they are willing to fund this from their own income or reserves. This is unacceptable and will be strongly opposed by Prospect and other unions.\n\u201cThis money will make almost no difference to government given the scale of expenditure on supporting the economy during the crisis, but it will mean the world to these workers who are some of the lowest paid in the public sector.\n\u201cGiven that other arm\u2019s length bodies seem to be able to top up salaries, it is extraordinary that heritage seems to have been singled out in this way by government.\u201d\nOther public bodies such as Transport for London are topping up the wages of furloughed workers. Staff at the National Museums of Scotland are also being furloughed with a top-up.\nCivil servants who cannot work from home but whose jobs are not essential are also being paid 100% of their salaries.\nMore than 140,000 companies employing a total of about a million workers put in applications to the government\u2019s job furlough scheme on its first day of operation. It is understood the price tag attached to the requests is about \u00a31bn, a figure that is likely to rise significantly as more companies make their applications for help over the coming weeks.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe coronavirus job retention scheme is designed to protect businesses and jobs across the economy at this unprecedented time.\n\u201cWe expect all decisions by public sector employers accessing the scheme to be taken on a value-for-money basis.\n\u201cIt may be appropriate for a public sector employee\u2019s pay to be topped up under the scheme, in some exceptional cases.\u201d",

        "content": "Government rejects claim by militant groups that the virus does not harm Muslims and imposes night-time curfew\nSomalia has recorded a rise in coronavirus cases in the past week, with the majority of those affected reportedly young people.\nSo far there have been 237 confirmed cases and eight deaths in the country. A member of parliament and a state minister are among those who have died.\n\u201cThe sharp increase is due to the fact that we are testing patients with all symptoms, not necessarily contact tracing,\u201d said Dr Mohamed M Ali Fuje, the government\u2019s newly appointed chief medical officer.\nNinety per cent of the confirmed cases are in the capital, Mogadishu, and although the government has introduced measures to contain the virus, widespread behavioural change is proving difficult. People continue to congregate in mosques, and gather in groups at teashops and restaurants, increasing the risk of infections.\n\u201cLife is normal here,\u201d said Khadija Hassan, a resident in Mogadishu. \u201cIt is like the global pandemic has not reached us yet. Personally, I won\u2019t leave my house for two weeks because I see people in my neighbourhood showing symptoms of the coronavirus. They talk of loss of smell, fever and cough and they say it is just a common cold as they continue to mingle with no isolation or social distancing.\u201d\nLast week the government imposed a night-time curfew and schools have been closed, but the streets have remained full.\n\u201cIt is as though the schools were closed for public holiday,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cStudents and children are freely loitering in the streets, playing football and gathering in crowds in the neighbourhood.\u201d\nThere is also fear that the virus may have crept into the city\u2019s crowded settlements of around 800,000 displaced people, many of them victims of the climate crisis. In the cramped, squalid conditions of the camps, there is only so much the government can do to prevent the spread of the virus.\nWhat is more concerning to authorities are the dangerous rumours about coronavirus that have taken hold. These myths include the theory that the virus does not affect Muslims or is a punishment for non-believers for oppressing Muslims. The militant group al-Shabaab, who control large swathes of south and central Somalia, has shared similar messages.\nEarlier this month, a controversial cleric claimed he would cure coronavirus patients using the Qu\u2019ran and has called on people to seek his help. \u201cIf I fail to cure it, I should be shot in the head,\u201d he said in a video posted on Facebook.\nIn another video, he claimed to have cured a patient from London over the phone, and he has promised to treat the Somali diaspora if they contact him, claiming to have already cured patients with HIV in the past.\nMuslim clerics, including one of the most respected Somali clerics, Sheikh Maxamed Umal, have been quick to try to debunk the myths, encouraging people to protect themselves and seek medical advice if they feel sick and reassuring people worried over the alcohol content in hand sanitiser.\nBut the national task force has yet to announce firm guidelines on how to approach the holy month of Ramadan, which starts on Thursday and involves communal rituals such as breaking fast together and extended night prayers.\n\u201cThe ministry of religious affairs continues to engage closely with religious leaders, there is a responsibility on all leaders to assist in raising public awareness and community engagement throughout the country with regard to Covid-19. It has not been exhaustive and we should continue to push the envelope,\u201d said Fuje.\nSomalia\u2019s health system has collapsed after 30-years of conflict and authorities are working hard to avoid the devastating impact of the coronavirus.\nThere are 14 isolation centres serving a population of 15 million people yet a hospital with modern medical equipment, including ventilators, is lying unused in the capital for political reasons, according to Mahad Awad, an MP who criticised the United Arab Emirates government, which built the facility before closing it two years ago over a diplomatic dispute with Somalia.\n\u201cWe are extremely concerned of this pandemic,\u201d Fuje said. \u201cOur testing capacity is limited, we don\u2019t have enough facilities or test kits to do mass tests. There are currently only three approved Covid-19 testing facilities countrywide.\u201d",

        "content": "Three-quarters of people with hearing loss fear they will be less productive working from home. What support is needed?\nWorking from home is a challenge for many of us, from learning how to communicate with colleagues via Zoom, to acquainting ourselves with the nuances of telephone conference calls. But imagine what it must be like if you are deaf or have difficulty hearing.\nResearch published on Wednesday by the charity Action on Hearing Loss found that three-quarters of people who live with deafness fear they will be less productive working from home.\nRob Geaney, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action on Hearing Loss, says: \u201cHome working is a huge challenge for people living with deafness or hearing loss. They are at greater risk of further isolation due to social-distancing measures. While many people will use phone and video calls to stay in contact with friends and families and work colleagues, people with hearing loss, especially those who lip-read or use British Sign Language, will be excluded from these interactions.\u201d\nLip-reading requires an individual to concentrate intently on both the movement of the lips and the sound they can hear to piece together what is being said, Geaney explains. This is tiring and many people only get most of what is being said \u2013 with contextual clues being used to fill the gaps.\n\u201cIt is therefore helpful to consider using text boxes or visual presentations alongside video conferences, particularly if communicating numbers or complex jargon,\u201d he says.\nIn the UK, 12 million people have hearing loss and 65% of working-age deaf people are employed, compared with 79% of the general population. An estimated 24,000 people use BSL as their main language. The Equality Act 2010 obliges employers to make adjustments (like a BSL interpreter or a speech to text reporter) and the government\u2019s Access to Work scheme provides grants for specialist equipment.\n\u201cTo make the workplace more accessible, face someone when speaking to them, speak one at a time in meetings, and don\u2019t give people a desk facing a wall but allow them to face into the office, so they can communicate,\u201d says Geaney.\n\u201cThe key thing for home working is that managers should feel able to talk to members of staff about their hearing loss and the adjustments that they need,\u201d he adds.\nBut the charity\u2019s focus groups revealed a reluctance among employees to disclose hearing loss at work because of embarrassment, stress or fear that it might affect job prospects. One said: \u201cYou want to do a good job at work, you do not want anyone to see hearing loss as a weakness.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hidden condition and many staff who have concealed their hearing loss and coped without any support might now need support to find adjustments that work for them,\u201d says Geaney. Similarly, those who had adjustments set up in their place of work might now need new adjustments put in place, such as an amplified telephone or handsets that can be linked to an individual\u2019s hearing aid.\nBehaviour changes that hearing colleagues could make include speaking one at a time, muting themselves when not speaking to reduce background noise, having a clear agenda to provide structure and contextual clues to what is being said. For video conferencing it is helpful if the camera is square-on and everyone is well lit from the front. If the source of light is behind the individual then faces might be in shadow.\nAction on Hearing Loss research suggests the biggest reason people are without support is that they feel colleagues lack the knowledge to help. Almost half of respondents surveyed said deaf awareness (\u201cinformation on educating your colleagues or managers\u201d) would help them fulfil their potential, and more than a third said support to manage the anxiety of hearing loss at work would help.\nCity Lit adult education college in central London holds an annual Deaf Day to raise awareness (although this year\u2019s has been postponed due to coronavirus). Founded in 1919, the college began running lip-reading classes for soldiers deafened in the first world war. Courses specifically for deaf people include BSL, English, maths and digital skills. There are 12 deaf tutors and six who are hearing (but teach in BSL) plus a network of BSL interpreters who offer support in meetings or job interviews. It also provides employment advice to its students in partnership with the Royal Association for Deaf people. A bursary helps low-income deaf students pay course fees and travel.\nMark Hopkinson, head of City Lit\u2019s Centre for Deaf Education, says solutions to better integrating deaf people at work rest on attitudes: \u201cSupport in the workplace depends on the organisation and ethos. Are hearing colleagues prepared to help with deaf colleagues?\u201d BSL, in particular, is vital, he says. \u201cSupposing you weren\u2019t allowed to speak for a number of years, [forced] to remain silent, how would you feel?\u201d\nEnglish is often a second language for deaf people after sign language. But for Ilyaas Cader, a refugee from Sri Lanka, his first language is Tamil Sign, his second BSL and his third English. \u201cI learned sign language first \u2013 that helped me learn the English. I had to learn English grammar, which is different from sign grammar,\u201d he tells me, using a BSL interpreter.\nCader, 45, won a City Lit centenary award last year for outstanding achievement. He is a children\u2019s mental health worker in a specialist NHS unit for deaf children, and says his career is largely due to his time at City Lit. Without the specialist classes and support to get a job, he says, \u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t be working in mental health where I\u2019m using my skills and my challenging experiences \u2013 barriers, emotional struggles, lack of access \u2013 to be a role model to children of how a deaf person can succeed.\u201d\nDeaf people are twice as likely to have mental health issues compared with hearing people, with communication barriers exacerbating symptoms like depression. There are also communication barriers for deaf people receiving mental health support. BSL interpreters are third parties in counselling sessions designed to be one-to-one. This can affect treatment because the counselling can be less intimate.\nCader believes that \u201caudism\u201d (negative attitudes towards deaf people) is deeply ingrained. More hearing professionals using sign language would help, he says.\n\u201cIf a deaf person needs to go to the doctor, they should be able to have a conversation with the doctor in their first language. And there should be more people like me out there doing the sort of work I\u2019m doing.\u201d",

They are at increased risk of contracting Covid-19 or passing it on to patients or colleagues, Burn said.\nA new survey by the college of 1,685 UK psychiatrists last week found what Burn said were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d flaws in the availability of both personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing for mental health staff.\nIt found, for example, that almost one in four (23%) psychiatrists across the four home nations could not access the right PPE, with Scotland (29%) the country with the worst shortage.\nOnly half the psychiatrists said they had been able to get a coronavirus test for themselves, and just 30% for their families. That is despite the health secretary, Matt Hancock\u2019s, recent assurances that any NHS staff member who wanted a test could have one.\nDr Adrian James, the college\u2019s registrar, said: \u201cA patient with or at risk of contracting Covid-19 is the same in all healthcare settings and they should be treated the same.\n\u201cNot all our buildings are set up to withstand infection control and we\u2019re hearing some real fear from our frontline psychiatrists who are putting themselves and their families in danger every time they go to work.\u201d\nIn addition, 42 researchers from around the world, including Prof David Gunnell from the University of Bristol, have formed the International COVID-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration, to monitor the potential impact the crisis has on mental health.\nWriting in the Lancet Psychiatry, the researchers say an increase in suicides is not inevitable, provided preventive action is taken imminently.\nThe authors write: \u201cSuicide is likely to become a more pressing concern as the pandemic spreads and has longer-term effects on the general population, the economy and vulnerable groups.\n\u201cPreventing suicide therefore needs urgent consideration. The response must capitalise on, but extend beyond, general mental health policies and practices.\u201d\nPeople with psychiatric disorders might experience worsening symptoms and others might develop new mental health problems, especially depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, while loss of employment and financial worries may contribute to feelings of hopelessness, the group says.\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has backed an initiative to provide mental health support to those working against coronavirus.\nMind, Samaritans, Shout, Hospice UK and the Royal Foundation have launched Our Frontline, a combination of support and online resources for NHS workers, carers, emergency services and key workers.\nFrontline staff and keyworkers can call or text a trained volunteer and access specially developed online resources, toolkits and advice to support their mental health and emotional wellbeing.\nPrince William said: \u201cOver the past few weeks, millions of frontline workers across the UK have put their physical and mental health on the line to protect us all during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cEvery day they confront traumatic situations at the same time as having to contend with their own worries about the risks to themselves and their families.\u201d",

        "content": "Martin Lee, who was arrested on Saturday, says protests will turn fatal if authorities go ahead with expected national security push\nMartin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic party, has said there will be more fatalities and protests if authorities try to pass anti-subversion laws \u2013 which would outlaw \u201csedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets\u201d \u2013 before the September legislature election.\n\u201cIt will result in deaths for sure,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe Communist party won\u2019t show any mercy. They have already stated their stance.\u201d\nLee said he had felt guilty seeing some 7,000 people arrested during the months-long anti-government movement, but that his own arrest on Saturday meant he could at last look them in the face. \u201cIt was a good thing,\u201d the barrister said.\nLee said his arrest, along with 14 other veteran pro-democracy figures on charges of illegal assembly, and high-profile posturing from China over the past week, were part of Beijing\u2019s wider plan to tighten its control over Hong Kong.\nChina\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong last week called for national security legislation and controversially declared it was not bound by a clause in the city\u2019s post-handover mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which bars the Chinese government from interfering in local affairs. Hong Kong is guaranteed \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d under the one country two systems principle enshrined in the Basic Law, but the liaison office said this did not mean \u201ccomplete autonomy\u201d.\n\u201cIt would come sooner or later. They already said in 2014 they would exercise \u2018complete jurisdiction\u2019 in Hong Kong,\u201d said Lee, once trusted by Beijing as one of the drafters of the Basic Law.\nA Beijing policy white paper asserted that China had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong and the city\u2019s \u201chigh degree of autonomy \u2026 comes solely from the authorisation by the central leadership\u201d.\n\u201cChina has breached the agreement, not only with Hong Kong but with the international community,\u201d he said, referring to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, a legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations. \u201cThe international community has a moral obligation to speak out.\u201d\n\u201cThey are now completely besieging Hong Kong, they see no need to be courteous,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want Hongkongers to be as obedient and subservient as people in any other Chinese city. They want complete control.\u201d\nStill, Lee said he would not give up on his fight for democracy, even if he was to go to jail.\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed but this has strengthened my will,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t give up because we have the moral high ground.\u201d",

        "content": "Activists hold mass video calls and share hashtags, and three-day livestream planned for Earth Day\nThe large crowds and brightly coloured placards of the school climate strikes became some of the defining images of 2019.\n\u201cThere would be lots of chanting and the energy was always amazing,\u201d says Dominique Palmer, a 20-year-old climate activist from London who has been involved with the strikes for more than a year. \u201cBeing there with everyone in that moment is truly an electrifying feeling. It\u2019s very different now.\u201d\nThe coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to large gatherings of people the world over, and the climate strikers have had to change their tactics. Now, instead of big crowds they hold mass video calls, and instead of marching with banners and placards they post photos with hashtags.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started digital striking because we want to keep the momentum going, so that when the pandemic is contained we still have that energy and we can go back on to the streets,\u201d says Palmer.\nEvery Friday, the strikers post photos of themselves holding a sign with a message about the climate crisis along with #DigitalStrike or #ClimateStrikeOnline, and they congregate in large Zoom calls, often with more than 100 people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest call but also the most chaotic call you could ever imagine,\u201d says Rikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark. \u201cSometimes people bring animals; one time someone was playing the saxophone.\u201d\nThe calls are giving the strikers a unique opportunity to connect with people they would not normally get the chance to meet. \u201cI think we will start to see more of an international perspective in every country because of this,\u201d says Nielsen.\nThe digital strikes are not the only online climate activism. In the US, groups are preparing a three-day livestream to mark Earth Day, an annual event celebrated around the world on 22 April to demonstrate support for protecting the environment.\nWednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.\nBut the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a \u201ca collective call for transformative action for our planet\u201d.\nAmong the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.\nOn Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.\nFridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, Talks for Future, which features climate scientists and other experts.\nActivists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects.\nThis new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. \u201cMy activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn\u2019t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,\u201d she says.\nDeniz \u00c7evikus, 12, from Istanbul, who usually protests alone, enjoys talking to more people online. \u201cDuring a typical solo strike I can talk to 20 or 30 people at most, but with the same [digital] strike I can reach thousands of people on social media,\u201d she says.\n\u201cStriking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.\u201d\nDylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it\u2019s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.\u201d\nWhile the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning.\n\u201cWe are more present on the streets, and we know it\u2019s not a social media bubble \u2013 we\u2019re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,\u201d Nielsen says.\nAs the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,\u201d says Hamilton. \u201cWe know that you can\u2019t do everything all at once.\u201d\nThere is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle \u2013 not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a bit of motivation,\u201d Hamilton adds. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to be able to do the big protests again.\u201d\nBut there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change.\n\u201cSeeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cWhen politicians tell us things don\u2019t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.\u201d",

        "content": "In a charming new documentary produced by Ryan Murphy, a film-maker explores her parents\u2019 business: a Los Angeles store selling gay porn\nRachel Mason always remembers her parents telling her as a teenager not to let anyone know what they did for a living. \u201cThey used the same codes the mafia does,\u201d Mason said. \u201cMy mom had five different \u2018official\u2019 job titles as one point. She\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m in real estate\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a manager\u2019.\u201d\nBoth of which were, in a sense, true. Karen and Barry Mason \u2013 two quiet, middle-aged and, in the mother\u2019s case, devoutly religious, people \u2013 did, in fact, own a commercial property and did run a store. What they kept hidden was the fact that their store happened to be the largest purveyor of hardcore gay pornography in Los Angeles, a place unknown to the general public but legendary among gay men across the US. At one point, through their mail-order business, the couple became perhaps the biggest distributors of gay porn in the US. In the 80s and 90s, the Masons\u2019 store, named Circus of Books, was the place to pick up explicit gay magazines and movies, some of which the couple even produced, along with such useful accoutrements as lube, dildos and cock rings. It was even a good place to find sex, with the friskier patrons ducking out back to an area teeming enough to earn the nickname \u201cVaseline Alley\u201d.\nIt was the kind of store \u201cyou\u2019d expect two extra-fetishy leather daddies to own\u201d, Rachel Mason said, with a laugh. \u201cWhich is what made this whole thing so bizarre.\u201d\nThe disparity between her parents\u2019 character and the specifics of their business serves as the jumping-off point for an illuminating new documentary named Circus of Books, which is produced by Ryan Murphy and is now available on Netflix. The movie, directed by Rachel, an artist and musician, covers more than her parents\u2019 unusual double life and the family\u2019s complex dynamic. It also delves into the special role a venue like Circus of Books had in the lives of gay men of an earlier era. The heyday of the store \u2013 which the Masons owned from 1983 until its closing in 2019 \u2013 peaked several decades ago, a time when the lives of their gay male patrons were far more fraught, and covert, than the open LGBTQ+ world of today. \u201cTo be a homo was unspeakable,\u201d says Billy Miller, publisher of the seminal gay magazine Straight to Hell, in the film. \u201cI can\u2019t even explain how different it was.\u201d\nIn the movie, older gay men talk about the store in hallowed tones, expressing a mixture of affection, connection and awe. \u201cTo see men naked and unafraid, that gave us a lot of pride,\u201d says Don Norman, a Circus regular, while another says: \u201cIt made every gay man feel comfortable about exploring their sexuality.\u201d\nThe film also places the store in the larger context of gay politics by covering a little-known, but significant, demonstration against police crackdowns on LA gay bars that occurred two and half years before Stonewall. Initially, Rachel planned to make that history, and the function of the store in its patrons\u2019 lives, the core of her film. But, over time she came to realize that her family was a more compelling hook. \u201cI shaped the story based on what I came to believe people would be most interested in,\u201d she said.\nEveryone in her immediate family spoke for the film, including Rachel\u2019s two brothers and her parents. But it\u2019s the clan\u2019s matriarch who became the film\u2019s central, if reluctant, star. From the start, we see Karen telling her daughter \u201cthis is going to be such a boring tape\u201d and \u201cyou gotta stop filming\u201d.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a worthy subject,\u201d Karen reiterated to the Guardian. \u201cThere are people doing much more interesting things than I was,\u201d citing as an example Act Up, who \u201cwere out there changing policy\u201d.\nTo Karen and her husband, the store was a purely entrepreneurial venture. \u201cWe took advantage of a business opportunity,\u201d she said.\nAt the time, the couple felt they didn\u2019t have a viable alternative. Neither of the parents had lucrative jobs in the 80s and they had three children to raise. One day, Karen noticed an ad placed by Larry Flynt in a local publication seeking someone to distribute his oft-banned magazine, Hustler. The Masons answered and soon found they were good at the job. When Flynt branched out by publishing some of the first slick gay porn magazines, such as Blue Boy and Honcho, the Masons began distributing them as well, with great success. A store on Santa Monica Blvd, the center of gay life in the city, named Book Circus had been selling gay porn but was having trouble paying its bills, so the couple stepped in to buy it. To retain the brand, but dodge a potential lawsuit, they simply turned the name around to Circus of Books. In those days, long before the ubiquity of internet porn, the VHS tapes the store sold, with titles like School of Hard Cocks and A Rim with A View, flew off the shelves. \u201cThese are the videos that sent me to college,\u201d Rachel said.\nBut, as a child, she was kept in the dark. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my kids to be affected by anything I was doing,\u201d Karen said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if people would want their children playing with somebody\u2019s children who owned a store like that.\u201d\nRachel, a highly creative child, grew up with lots of gay friends, including a guy in high school who, one day, asked her the name of her parents\u2019 store. When she told him, he burst out laughing, and then hipped her to the store\u2019s true content. \u201cIt was such a shock, because my mom was an endless authority figure,\u201d the director said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t doing anything that was remotely interesting.\u201d\nWhen Rachel asked her mother about the store\u2019s content, \u201cshe immediately downplayed it, saying: \u2018Well, the other half of the store has all kinds of magazines, like the New York Review of Books,\u2019\u201d Rachel said. \u201cBut the reality of it was, 90% of their business was in the \u2018over 18\u2019 section.\u201d\nHer mother also downplayed the significance of she and her husband later getting into producing gay porn films, starring the king of the genre, Jeff Stryker. \u201cShe told me: \u2018I didn\u2019t think we were getting into pornography, I just thought we were getting into a different aspect of the same business,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cThat, to me, was the ultimate in denial.\u201d\nKaren objects to that characterization. \u201cI don\u2019t like the word denial,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t make myself familiar [with the material]. I was never interested in what it represented.\u201d\nRachel believes her mother\u2019s attitude reflects \u201cthe shame that\u2019s part of her religious guilt. That attitude is so deep, in terms of sex being bad and sinful,\u201d she said.\nKaren\u2019s conservative Jewish faith also made it difficult for her to accept it when her younger son, Josh, came out to her in his college years. Despite having supported scores of gay men who worked at her store, as well as standing by them during the height of the Aids crisis, Karen said she was unable to deal with her son\u2019s sexuality for a long time. \u201cWhen he came out, I didn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually went into the closet.\u201d\nOver the years, Karen\u2019s view evolved dramatically, to the point where she later became an active member in the LA chapter of PFlag, an organization which helps parents understand, and support, their LGBTQ+ children. Still, the jarring disparity between Karen\u2019s exposure to the gay world and her initial reaction to her gay son, as well as her inability to integrate her source of income with its true context, reflects something deep in society. Namely, its ongoing difficulty in accepting sexual pleasure, in every consensual form, as natural, as well as in recognizing its elevated role in the lives of gay men, particularly from a certain era. \u201cFor a generation of gay men that never saw even the slightest glimmer of two men doing anything romantic, to see porn reflected a deeply suppressed desire,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIn that sense, gay porn was so radical, it\u2019s off the charts. There\u2019s heroism in that.\u201d\nWhile her mother isn\u2019t comfortable seeing herself as part of that righteous fight, she has \u201clearned to see [the store\u2019s role] from all different points of view\u201d, she said.\nThe store also had a role to play the battle to preserve free speech. In the mid-80s, when Ronald Regan and his attorney general, Ed Meese, launched a national \u201cwar on pornography\u201d, the Masons faced felony charges, and potential jail sentences, for transporting banned goods across state lines. Karen, who had worked as a journalist for the Cincinnati Enquirer years earlier, had covered Larry Flynt\u2019s free speech battles against the government. \u201cSo, I knew that first amendment speech is not defended in high rhetoric,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s defended in pretty fringey places.\u201d\nIn the end, the couple\u2019s lawyer got the charges downgraded to near nothing, but the experience made the two even more circumspect about telling people what they did for a living. The legacy of Circus of Books has only grown over the years, as it represents a lost world, replaced by ubiquitous porn available on the internet, and the migration of sexual hookups from places such as Vaseline Alley to apps like Grindr and Scruff.\nKaren hopes her own evolution in accepting her gay son will serve as an example to other parents. But she\u2019s less thrilled to find herself a public figure because of the film. For her daughter, the documentary\u2019s greatest use could come in teaching younger LGBTQ+ people what the older generation did.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so disgusted by people who use the term OK boomer,\u201d said the director. \u201cIf you had any idea what these people fought and died for, you\u2019d be deferential. We don\u2019t know many of their stories because there was so much shame and condemnation and exclusion. We need to unearth these untold stories and preserve that history.\u201d\nCircus of Books is now available on Netflix",

        "content": "From body removal and driving ambulances to fitting clinicians\u2019 face masks, UK firefighters are volunteering for vital new roles\n\u201cSeeing how families are being torn apart is really distressing and sad,\u201d says Bill Pitt. \u201cAs firefighters, we want to be out there and to be reassuring.\u201d\nPitt, a firefighter in the West Midlands, was one of the first in the region to join new teams of police, ambulance and fire crews to help move the bodies of people known or suspected to have died of Covid-19. As the Fire Brigade Union (FBU) health and safety officer for the region, he was keen to assess the risks involved for the UK firefighters volunteering in huge numbers to perform vital new roles in the pandemic.\nWhile some of their usual duties have been scaled back or suspended, firefighters and support staff are stepping in to provide additional resources for hard-pressed public services, such as ambulance services, which are receiving a record number of calls. As well as ensuring bodies are safely prepared to be moved, new tasks include driving ambulances, ensuring clinicians\u2019 face masks are fitted correctly, delivering PPE to frontline staff and taking food and medicine to vulnerable people.\nIt is part of the response to the crisis organised by local resilience forums, which include police, councils and other public services.\nAlex Johnson, chief fire officer for South Yorkshire fire and rescue, says firefighters and support staff responded immediately to the call for volunteers. \u201cMy firefighters have received, unpacked and delivered nearly one million pieces of PPE for social care staff,\u201d she says. Community safety officers, who usually visit people in their homes, are identifying vulnerable people and coordinating support for them.\nThe FBU has expressed concern that its members may face additional hazards and is worried about a potential lack of PPE and training for fire staff. But Johnson assures she wouldn\u2019t let any member of staff carry out tasks without correct PPE or training.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say how proud I am of all the volunteers who have come forward. I can\u2019t think of anybody better placed to step into these additional roles,\u201d she says. \u201cThe response has been outstanding.\u201d\nFive new tasks for firefighters were included in an agreement struck at the end of March between the FBU, fire chiefs and fire and rescue employers, with three more \u2013 antigen testing, driving non-blue light ambulance transport and training new ambulance drivers \u2013 added last week.\nBut as firefighters\u2019 roles increase in the crisis, so do concerns about their health. \u201cIt has been been quite tricky, because there is pressure on employers and fire chiefs, from the government, and primarily from the Home Office, just to get things done quickly,\u201d says the FBU general secretary, Matt Wrack.\nThe union wants to ensure any additional roles are appropriate and do not detract from core fire service work, and that all staff receive necessary protective equipment and training, he adds.\nThe number of fire staff affected by the virus has increased with some 3,000 fire and rescue staff now self-isolating. The union says members\u2019 safety remains a priority. \u201cChief officers may get a call for support and say yes without thinking through all the implications,\u201d says Wrack. \u201cWe need to ensure that proper risk assessment, PPE and training are all in place. If our members are moving bodies, for instance, they need to know the correct processes on how to do that.\u201d\nDespite safety concerns, Wrack says firefighters and control staff have always stepped in when the public is in danger and this crisis is no different.\nIn the West Midlands, Pitt points out that fire services have experience of moving bodies. What\u2019s different now, though, is the scale of demand. \u201cBefore, there were rare occasions where we might be called to assist the police with body retrieval, especially if it was in a difficult location,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is beyond anything we have seen before.

Karen Adams, FBU secretary for Dorset and Wiltshire, where many firefighters have also volunteered for the new duties, says the main task at the moment in her region is to support local services, including ambulance services.\nBut fire staff are ready to help, and have all the PPE they need, she says. \u201cWe have been really pleased with how our service has responded to keep our people safe.\u201d",

LGIM will continue to support and hold companies to account for their stakeholder responsibilities.\u201d\nThe nationwide coronavirus lockdown has shut swathes of the economy, from the high street to the travel industry, financially crippling businesses across the UK.\nHow businesses react, such as directors sacrificing salaries and bonuses and staff being treated fairly, will be put under the spotlight when corporations face investors at annual meetings.\nLGIM\u2019s ninth annual \u201cactive ownership\u201d report, which charts the action it took against companies over environmental, social and governance issues (ESG) last year, shows the company opposed 35% of pay packages globally. And in the UK, LGIM voted against 17 chairs of remuneration committees at companies in which it holds a stake on behalf of clients.\n\u201cThe industry needs to show investors and regulators what it has achieved on ESG issues, not what it thinks is important,\u201d said Sadan. \u201cI hope this ninth report demonstrates how serious we at LGIM are about all these issues and the actions we take on them.\u201d\nLGIM said climate change was the leading topic of engagement it had with companies last year.\nThe company said it had taken sanctions against 11 companies named as \u201claggards\u201d for failing to take sufficient action on climate change, including ExxonMobil.\nDuring 2019, LGIM said it most frequently engaged with companies including BP, Ford, Shell, HSBC and Amazon.\nThe company co-filed its first ever shareholder resolution, targeting BP, which led to the oil giant pledging to reduce its carbon footprint to net zero.\nAs well as the response to coronavirus, LGIM said it planned to focus on key corporate governance areas such as diversity, employee pay and data privacy.\n\u201cEveryone has a policy on diversity \u2013 but what have they actually done?\u201d said Sadan. \u201cWe also plan to focus on financial inequality, from executive pensions to the living wage and gender pay gap.

This is Justine Landis-Hanley bringing you the main stories on Wednesday 22 April.\nThe energy minister, Angus Taylor, has announced the government, like many Australian drivers, will capitalise on plummeting petrol prices by purchasing almost $100m worth of fuel for its national stockpile.\nThe problem is the federal government doesn\u2019t have any room left in the country to store the fuel. The reserve will instead be held in the United States at first, with plans to move it to Australia after the country increases its domestic storage capacity.\nThe Australian Rugby League commissioner, Wayne Pearce, announced the league has been given the go-ahead to restart its season on 28 May, with training kicking off as early as 4 May.\nThe NSW Rugby League boss, Dave Trodden, also confirmed the league plans to resume its grassroots competition seasons in July, but that the NRL\u2019s reserve grade competition will remain cancelled due to coronavirus.\nVictorian house prices to fall 9%\nThe Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, predicts property prices across the state will \u201cfall by about 9% by the end of this calendar year\u201d.\nHe said government data estimates around 270,000 jobs will be lost, and the current unemployment rate will double by September.\nPallas warned the Victorian economy will come out looking much smaller than anticipated this financial year, performing $32bn below what was expected in the first six months of 2020.\nWaverley Council has voted to reopen the water at Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches from next Tuesday.\nMayor Paula Masselos warned that beachgoers will be prohibited from exercising on the sand, and that fences erected on the beaches will tunnel swimmers and surfers in and out of the water.\nThe Australian defence force is using its members to test the effectiveness of chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, against coronavirus.\nBut Labor, crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie, and experts have urged Defence to keep the trials voluntary for members, due to the drug\u2019s known side effects and questionable safety.\nThe Labor-led Senate committee set up to review the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic will hold its first public hearing on Thursday.\nChief medical officer Dr Brendan Murphy, along with key Department of Health representatives, will appear before the committee during the meeting, broadcasted publicly between 10am and 1pm.\nThe committee will hold twice-weekly hearings during the initial inquiry stages, starting next week.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe Australian Services Union has come out swinging against Qantas for using the government\u2019s $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper payments to cover staff penalty rates.\nIt comes down to the way Qantas pays its staff: base wages are paid in one fortnightly pay period, while any shift penalties and allowances are paid two weeks later, in arrears.\nThe airline argues that during a fortnight where an employee does not work, it is lawful for the airline to use the $1,500 payment to cover penalty rates overdue from the previous fortnight.\nBut the ASU says Qantas needs to come to a \u201cjoint understanding\u201d with them over how jobkeeper will be used; otherwise the union will consider its options, including litigation.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nVirgin Australia: what does voluntary administration mean and how will it affect you?\nHow the coronavirus contact tracing app will work\nJobkeeper payment: check your eligibility.

The core analysed was about 1.1m long and about 14cm wide.\nLannuzel said when researchers analysed the core, they found the plastics were surrounded by algae that had grown in the ice.\n\u201cSea ice is habitat for key foraging species,\u201d she said. \u201cKrill defines everything else in the food chain and it relies on sea ice algae to grow.\n\u201cWhen you think now that sea ice algae is associated to plastics, you can think about the bioaccumulation of the plastics in krill and in whales.\u201d\nThere was a higher concentration of plastic particles at the bottom of the ice core.\nShe said a lot of study was still needed to understand the impact of plastics on species relying on the sea ice.\nShe said it was not known if the toxicity of plastics was affected by the processes in the guts of krill and other species, including whales that feed on the krill.\nKelly said: \u201cRather than sinking to the deep ocean, the entrapment of microplastics in Antarctic sea ice allows them to persist for longer near the sea surface.\nKelly said krill was \u201ca keystone species in Southern Ocean ecosystems\u201d and was vital for marine predators higher up the food chain.\n\u201cIt is worth noting that plastic contamination of West Antarctic sea ice may be even greater than in our ice core from the east, as the Antarctic peninsula hosts the bulk of the continent\u2019s tourism, research stations and marine traffic.\u201d",

        "content": "Jeff Gibbs\u2019 film, produced by Michael Moore, takes a pop at green, liberal A-listers such as Al Gore \u2013 but doesn\u2019t dare criticise Greta Thunberg\nRecently, petrolhead pundit Jeremy Clarkson was thought to have disgraced himself by pointing out that the hi-tech sea yacht used by Greta Thunberg for her transatlantic crossing, for all its solar panels and underwater turbines, had an old-fashioned diesel engine aboard for emergencies. I thought about Clarkson\u2019s jibe while watching this refreshingly contrarian eco-documentary from environmentalist Jeff Gibbs, which has been uploaded for free online viewing by its executive producer, Michael Moore.\nGibbs has a cheeky habit of going backstage at music festivals that solemnly declare themselves to be using 100% renewable energy, only to find that the fancy array of solar panels behind the tent is enough to power a single bass guitar. The rest of the energy is provided by just plugging into the shameful old electricity grid, provided by fossil fuels. He sees it as symptomatic of the mainstream environmental movement, running on delusional piety.\nAll the green, liberal A-listers \u2013 Bill McKibben, Al Gore, Van Jones, Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 are attacked in this film as a pompous and complacent high-priest caste of the environmental movement, who are shilling for a fossil fuel industry that has sneakily taken them over. (Although it should be said that, for all his radical bravado, Gibbs does not dare criticise Thunberg.)\nBig Oil and its corporate and banking representatives have, according to this film, found a way to rebrand themselves as green or greenish, to use the green movement for their own ends, and to get their mitts on the huge subsidies that taxpayers around the world are handing over to anyone claiming to be developing renewable energy resources, which turn out to be the same old fossil-fuel entities in different packaging.\nSolar panels and wind turbines? These provide no energy when there is no sun or wind and degrade after only a few decades, says Gibbs. And in any case they need a lot of fossil fuels in their manufacture: silicon, cobalt, silver, graphite, rare earths \u2013 and of course coal. The same goes for manufacturing storage batteries. Factories claiming to have gone \u201cbeyond coal\u201d again and again turn out to be relying on natural gas. Corporate behemoths such as Apple make spurious claims for their energy usage. But how about the ultra-fashionable new \u201crenewable\u201d energy source: biomass or wood-chips? This is basically a colossal logging industry that requires a lot of fossil fuel energy to harvest and transport the material. As Gibbs\u2019 interviewees point out, you might just as well as burn the fossil fuels in the first place. And it is laying waste rainforests and areas of natural beauty.\nThis, says Gibbs, is the queasy merger of environmentalism and capitalism \u2013 and he makes a refreshingly sceptical case. But he takes it further, suggesting that unfettered capitalism and its insanity of eternal growth on a finite planet is also what is leading us to the cliff edge. True enough, although his comments on overpopulation have an unintentionally ironic chime, in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak.\nMost chillingly of all, Gibbs at one stage of the film appears to suggest that there is no cure for any of this, that, just as humans are mortal, so the species itself is staring its own mortality in the face. But he appears to back away from that view by the end, saying merely that things need to change. But what things and how?\nIt\u2019s not at all clear. I found myself thinking of Robert Stone\u2019s controversial 2013 documentary Pandora\u2019s Promise, which made a revisionist case for nuclear power: a clean energy source that (allegedly) has cleaned up its act on safety and really can provide for our wholesale energy needs without contributing to climate change, in a way that \u201crenewables\u201d can\u2019t.\nGibbs doesn\u2019t mention nuclear and \u2013 a little lamely, perhaps \u2013 has no clear lesson or moral, other than the need to take a fiercely critical look at the environmental establishment. Well, it\u2019s always valuable to re-examine a sacred cow.\n Planet of the Humans is available on YouTube.",

This can include isolating themselves in a similar manner to that recommended by the UK government for people aged 70 years and over,\u201d they said in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.\n\u201cWhile the severity of the disease increases from the age of 40 years, those above the age of 60 years and those with underlying medical conditions including, but not limited to, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and cancers are at the highest risk.\u201d\nThey cited international evidence that over-60s are at higher risk. \u201cThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 80% of Covid-19-related deaths are in those aged 65 years and over,\u201d they said. In China, 80% of deaths were in the over-60s.\nSwitzerland and France were among the countries that advised over-65s to take greater precautions against infection, they added.\nOther scientists agree there is a cause for concern about the 60-69 age group. Dr Tom Wingfield from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cIt would be helpful to see what evidence was used to inform the UK government\u2019s decision to define people over 70 years old as a high-risk group rather than using a lower age threshold such as 60 or 65 years old. This is a really important issue for the general public when we consider that more than 7 million people in the UK are aged between 60 and 69 years old.\n\u201cIn addition to the general public, it is also vital that carers and key workers who are aged over 60, including those returning from retirement to work in the NHS and other social care settings, are provided with accurate information to be able to make informed decisions about minimising their own risk from Covid-19.\u201d\n This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to clarify the UK lockdown measures for people over 70.",

Seven of Toto Schillaci\u2019s 16 caps came in World Cup games (44%): does anyone have a higher percentage?\u201d\nLeaving one-cap wonders to one side, Rob Stevenson has more from 1990. \u201cI went poking around other squads in that World Cup for a candidate, and eventually dug this up. Robert Fleck played four times for Scotland, and two of those appearances were in the 1990 World Cup,\u201d he writes. Another 50% record is suggested by Chai from Atlanta: \u201cSpain\u2019s Albert Celades played four international matches, of which two were substitute appearances at the 1998 World Cup.\u201d\nFor absolute top-tier international completism, however, Daibhi O\u2019Leary takes us back to the very first tournament, in 1930. He explains: \u201cThe obvious example is Guillermo St\u00e1bile,\u201d whose four internationals all came in those finals, giving him a 100% record. \u201cHe made his debut in Argentina\u2019s second game (he only got in the side because the top scorer in their domestic league pulled out, apparently due to nerves) and won his fourth cap in the final; his performances won him both the inaugural Golden Boot (eight goals, scoring in every game) and a transfer to Genoa. That move and, later, injuries ended his international career. He then became arguably greater as a manager.\u201d\nBen Wallace and Paul Peters both came up with another 100%er in Laurie Hughes, from England\u2019s ill-fated 1950 campaign. \u201cAll of Hughes\u2019s England caps came in the 1950 World Cup,\u201d writes Ben. \u201cHe made his debut in the 2-0 win against Chile, played in the infamous loss against the USA and his final appearance came in a 2-0 defeat to Spain.\u201d Any more to report?\n\u201cWhat is the longest time it has taken a club to complete a new stand?\u201d wonders Rob Fielding.\n\u201cI imagine Oxford United\u2019s Kassam Stadium will beat Port Vale\u2019s 22-year wait for a finished stand. Currently at 19 years with a missing end,\u201d writes James Pollard, while David Calboutin recalls some lengthy inactivity in the north-east. \u201cNewcastle demolished The Leazes End in 1978 as part of a big plan to redevelop the ground. Unfortunately we were relegated and rebuilding was shelved until 1993, leaving a temporary terrace for 15 years, when the new stand was eventually built.\u201d\n\u201cWhich teams have been sponsored by products that don\u2019t exist any more and which team has been sponsored by the most defunct products?\u201d muses Noble Francis.\nWe thought this sounded familiar. But there are earlier instances. Gareth Vaughan goes back to the 1980s: \u201cI recall being told that West Brom were sponsored in 1984-85 by a public health warning to stop smoking. Given smoking is now prohibited in most work and internal public places, I wondered if this fits this description?\u201d Meanwhile, Richard Young adds: \u201cNorthern Rock at Newcastle United \u2026 Hopefully shortly also Mike Ashley, on several levels.\u201d\nChelsea started the Premier League era bearing the logo of a sadly departed company on their chests, writes Stuart Goodwin. \u201cUnbelievably to many who remember their computing heyday with the C64 and Amiga, but Commodore went out of business within 12 months of the completion of Premier League season v1.0,\u201d he notes. \u201cCommodore International\u2019s demise in April 1994 also meant that Chelsea took the pitch for the following month\u2019s FA Cup final wearing the badge of a company that no longer existed. In a similar vein, Crystal Palace went into the Premier League era sponsored by Tulip Computers \u2013 the Dutch company went under in 2009.\u201d\n\u201cIn 2011, I heard rumours about the owner of American wrestling company WWE, Vince McMahon, trying to buy Newcastle United,\u201d mailed Morten Hansen in January 2014. \u201cIs this true?\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to tell where the rumour linking Vince McMahon, CEO and chairman of WWE, with Newcastle came from, but it didn\u2019t take long to spread all over Twitter and start to creep in to the football news consciousness. The Newcastle Chronicle duly put the question to the club, but the official response was to brand the story \u201cnonsense\u201d and refuse to comment further. So the whole thing died almost as quickly as it had sprung in to life. And really, it\u2019s difficult to see how a rumour linking Sensible Mike\u2019s club with the man in charge of this sort of pantomime can ever have gained any traction.\nAs an adjunct to the question on defunct sponsors, Simon Bradley asks: \u201cWho are the most successful shirt sponsors, in terms of honours won? Of course, this is an inexact science, as determining the comparative value of different trophies is highly debatable. But off the top of my head: Sharp must be up there, having sponsored Manchester United during their 90s glory days; Carling cleaned up pretty much every trophy going in Scotland by sponsoring both Old Firm teams between 2003 and 2010; and Emirates Airline have four Champions Leagues with Real Madrid, as well as surely a clutch of other honours from various deals across Europe.\u201d\n\u201cWhich professional club has the longest-standing record transfer purchase fee?\u201d wonders Dan Weaver. \u201cMy guess is my club Wrexham with Joey Jones, when we were buying players from the European Cup holders, for \u00a3220,000 back in 1978.\u201d\n\u201cWho were the last father and son combination to play in the same team in the Football League?\u201d mails George Read.\n\u201cWolves\u2019 Europa League shirt is inspired by the traditional Mexican national team jersey, associated with our record signing Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez,\u201d writes Miles Johnson. \u201cAre there any other instances where a club has released a kit to honour a national team or nation itself? Didn\u2019t Crystal Palace once have a Brazil national team-inspired away kit or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the record number of consecutive successful penalties in shootouts in the same type of competition?\u201d asks Richard Askham. \u201cHuddersfield obviously hold the record in Football League play-offs, with 12 (and also the next best with 11). I suspect that Germany in World Cups and Euros will have an unbeatable record and I remember Ivory Coast scoring 12 or more in an Africa Cup of Nations shoot-out.\u201d\nAny instances of the manager of the month not being in charge of their team\u2019s every game in that month?\n\u201cWho is the shortest goalkeeper to play in either the old First Division or the Premier League? My guess it was Laurie Sivell who kept goal for Ipswich Town in the 70s,\u201d writes Mitch Mitchell.\nSend your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

        "content": "One of the lawyers representing Rui Pinto hopes the man behind the Football Leaks website, who is under house arrest awaiting trial for attempted blackmail, could soon be released as negotiations with the Portuguese authorities continue.\nPinto was extradited from Hungary in March 2019 for allegedly attempting to blackmail an investment fund and spent more than a year in custody before being moved last month to an apartment owned by Lisbon\u2019s judiciary police, where he is banned from using the internet. He denies all wrongdoing.\nThe 31-year-old\u2019s lawyer William Bourdon confirmed that discussions were advancing over sharing information with the Portuguese authorities pertaining to two separate investigations into money laundering \u2013 one involving Africa\u2019s richest woman and the other several high-profile football figures \u2013 but he said it was \u201ca complex game\u201d.\n\u201cHe is under house arrest but we are hoping in the next few weeks to change his position,\u201d Bourdon told the Guardian. \u201cWe hope that he could be free as soon as possible without any restrictions.\n\u201cWe had a conversation with the chief of the investigations with the approval of the prosecutor all because the wind changed in Portugal. I cannot give the details other than to just confirm what I have said already: step by step we are starting to enter into a cordial relationship in order to envisage cooperation. But it\u2019s a complex game so we will see. I trust that every stakeholder will want to act in good faith, pragmatically and in the common interest.\u201d\nPinto, through his Football Leaks website, provided some of the evidence that led to Manchester City\u2019s Champions League ban after the club were found to have seriously misled Uefa and broken financial fair play rules \u2013 a decision they have appealed against to the court of arbitration for sport. He also triggered numerous investigations into tax evasion and corruption in football.\nPinto was unveiled as the source of the Luanda Leaks, which in January exposed the inner workings of the business empire of Africa\u2019s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, after Bourdon established the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF) and shared the files with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).\nDos Santos is being investigated for alleged embezzlement, money laundering and document forgery in Angola and has denied any wrongdoing. Portuguese authorities hope Pinto can provide crucial information to help the prosecutors.\n\u201cIf Football Leaks created an earthquake, it also created a kind of hostility towards Pinto because he was trying to destroy the economic \u2018wall\u2019 of football,\u201d Bourdon said. \u201cLittle by little, some people saw that all this information from Football Leaks could be helpful to uncover a world that is infected by criminality.\n\u201cBut Luanda Leaks was another level entirely. Most responsible Portuguese citizens and politicians are now grateful to Pinto for helping to accelerate the investigation.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThey know that she has acquired real estate in Portugal and is one of the richest individuals in the world and so you have seen there was a change of perception towards Rui Pinto. Suddenly there was a new approach towards him.\u201d\nBourdon confirmed that Pinto had spoken to the Portuguese authorities in connection with their Operation Fora de Jogo (Operation Offside) investigation into alleged tax evasion and money laundering. Almost 300 tax and police inspectors from the public prosecutor\u2019s office conducted 76 searches, including of the offices of the top\u2011division sides Porto, Benfica, Sporting, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es, Mar\u00edtimo, Estoril and Portimonense and the super-agent Jorge Mendes at the start of March. The clubs have denied wrongdoing; Mendes has not commented.\nPinto has hinted that key evidence relating to that investigation is contained in the 12 hard drives seized from his apartment in Budapest when he was arrested, although only he knows the passwords to access millions of documents contained in them.\n\u201cThe trial according to Portuguese law should be heard by September at the latest,\u201d said Bourdon. \u201cBut I hope that he will appear before a judge before then as a free man, which obviously would change everything.\u201d",

        "content": "Outraged fans posted 13m tweets, signed a petition and placed billboards to demand that show be revived for another season\nAnne Shirley, the fearless Canadian literary heroine, always speaks her mind.\nThe outspoken orphan who first appeared in Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s 1908 novel, Anne of Green Gables, has since appeared in countless movies and television spinoffs \u2013 and built a loyal global following.\nSo it should probably come as little surprise that fans of the show\u2019s latest remake \u2013 the TV series Anne With an E \u2013 are fiercely protective of their heroine. And like Anne, they\u2019re willing to fight for what they believe in.\nThe shows coproducers, Netflix and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), announced in November that the drama would be cancelled after three seasons.\nBut CBC\u2019s statement that the final season would bring a \u201csatisfying conclusion to Anne\u2019s journey\u201d did little to placate fans.\n\u201cPeople were outraged. The cast and the crew were also blindsided by it,\u201d said Lisa E, a Toronto-based organizer with AWAE Fan Projects. \u201cEveryone loves the show obviously. They just couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nThe day after the announcement, the group took to Twitter with rallying cry: renew the show.\nThe group, whose organizers live in Canada, the United States and throughout Europe, quickly raised thousands of dollars to amplify their message, placing five billboards in downtown Toronto and New York\u2019s Times Square.\nNearly 300,000 fans signed a petition on Change.org demanding the series be renewed for another season.\nBut the group\u2019s most successful \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 campaign has been a digital, guerilla-style battle against the two companies.\nMembers of the group have swarmed the comments section of CBC news stories to demand the show\u2019s revival, and posted more than 13m tweets directed at CBC and Netflix. This week, the group arrived en masse in the comments section of Netflix\u2019s quarterly earnings\u2019 call on Youtube.\nMatters came to a head on Sunday, when the CBC said it would begin block any \u201cAnne-related comments\u201d from news stories.\n\u201cMy sense is that CBC has not dealt with a sustained siege like this before,\u201d said one of the group\u2019s organizers, Rachel G, who lives in New York City.\nShe argued that the public broadcaster \u2013 in using social media to increase user engagement \u2013 has opened itself up to these broadsides.\n\u201cA lot of times, CBC\u2019s engagement questions on Twitter are things like \u2018What\u2019s your favourite charcuterie?,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy to go in there and say \u2018Hey, in this episode of Anne With an E, Gilbert ate meat \u2013 and also renew Anne With an E!\u201d\nIn November, CBC Kids published an article suggesting the group was using bots to artificially inflate its influence.\n\u201cMany of the accounts were created this month, they don\u2019t have profile pics, their usernames are generic names followed by strings of numbers and they don\u2019t have any followers,\u201d the article said.\n\u201cOf course they were just created that day,\u201d responded Rachel . \u201cI\u2019m not going to go on my personal Twitter and start tweeting about Anne With an E hundreds of times in one day.\u201d\nThe show has been praised for its unflinching portrayal of, slavery, Indigenous experiences, sexual assault and feminism.\n\u201cAs a woman of colour, there\u2019s always been this tension for me watching period dramas \u2013 I don\u2019t really see the point of adapting 19th- or 18th-century work if you\u2019re not going to move forward in some way,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cI feel like Anne With an E really tackled stories of people who have always existed but were ignored by television dramas. And it did so in such a beautiful and sensitive way.\u201d\nTo see the show cancelled with no reason given makes little sense, she said. \u201cI\u2019m an analytical person and with the metrics we have about how successful it is \u2026 I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nBoth Lisa and Rachel admit the odds are low that the show will ever return to offer closure.\n\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s television, right? It\u2019s not changing the world,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cBut there are just so few shows today that so joyfully optimistic, inclusive and representative. And that\u2019s worth fighting for.\u201d",

        "content": "Movianto was also involved in legal disputes with firm that built warehouse to store equipment\nThe warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.\nFor security reasons, the Guardian has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic\u2013size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.\nHowever, the Guardian can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (\u00a3107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.\nThe fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.\nThe disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to \u201clock the gates\u201d and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.\nMorley\u2019s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was \u201ca much bigger story that needs to be told\u201d about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.\nFor its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley\u2019s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.\n\u201cMovianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,\u201d the firm said.\nBut the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government\u2019s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German\u2013owned multinational to an American one.\nIn the coming months the custody of the UK\u2019s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.\nA Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \u201cThe pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.\u201d\nWidespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been \u201cone of distribution rather than one of supply\u201d. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.\nThat stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated \u00a3500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature\u2013controlled conditions.\nThe government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens & Minor, won the \u00a355m deal in the summer of 2018.\nAs part of Movianto\u2019s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.\nMovianto\u2019s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was \u201cmade by executives no longer associated with Movianto\u201d.\nA notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain \u201ca ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event\u201d.\nIn early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley\u2019s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became \u201cuncooperative\u201d. \u201cThis went on for weeks,\u201d he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent \u201cin accordance with the terms of the lease\u201d.\nAnother grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which \u201ckept going on the blink\u201d resulting, he alleges, in \u201ctemperature spikes\u201d.\nA Movianto source said Morley\u2019s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of \u201cMorley\u2019s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations\u201d.\nBy his own account, Morley\u2019s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. \u201cIt got to the point where I said I\u2019m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.\u201d When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.\nMovianto said the injunction was required as \u201ca result of Morley\u2019s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto\u2019s operations\u201d. It said Morley\u2019s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by \u201cvarious court proceedings\u201d that ruled in Movianto\u2019s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley\u2019s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.\nMorley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto \u2013 and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank\u2019s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a \u00a375m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the \u201cborrowed personal wealth\u201d to spend on \u201cSouth African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet\u201d.\nMorley told the Guardian his lifestyle was the result of hard work and \u201chad nothing to do with being a good landlord\u201d. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.\nAs works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm \u201cfailed to comply\u201d with the conditions of a \u00a361m loan facility.\nMorley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator\u2019s report, the legal dispute \u201ccaused delays to the construction works\u201d at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes \u201chave had no impact on Movianto\u2019s work in response to Covid-19\u201d.\nAccording to a government source, the transfer of the UK\u2019s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.\nThe warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for \u00a345m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.\nIn the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens & Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK\u2019s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.\nThe distribution of that stockpile\u2019s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new \u201c24/7 military operation\u201d to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,\u201d Hancock said.\nA government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic \u2013 the basis of Movianto\u2019s original contract. Movianto was now \u201csupporting\u201d the government\u2019s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were \u201cconfidential\u201d.\nJeff Jochims, the chief operating officer of Owens & Minor, said: \u201cWe look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH, but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.\u201d",

The move is being closely watched.\nThe decision came almost a month after the company halted work at facilities in the state in response to the mounting threat of the virus. Boeing is the US\u2019s largest export manufacturer and its peers are carefully monitoring the company\u2019s decision to get back to work.\nBut with at least two weeks still to go before Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s stay-home mandate is set to expire, which involves the closure of all non-essential companies (Boeing is considered essential), and potentially even longer before comprehensive coronavirus testing is in place, some employees say they are worried for their safety and are questioning why Boeing is rushing to open its doors in the middle of a pandemic.\n\u201cPart of me feels thankful that we\u2019re still employed, but the other part of me is kind of scared,\u201d said a Boeing employee who works in production support for the 767 airplane and will return to the facility in Everett, Washington, on Tuesday. She asked not to be identified to protect her job.\nThe employee, who has asthma, said she was up until 4am the previous night, worried about being able to stay healthy on the job.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just scary to me, because I know what it feels like to not be able to breathe,\u201d said the employee, who has worked for the company for over a decade. \u201cThe way this disease gets you, you just basically suffocate.\u201d\nBoeing also restarted work at production facilities in the Philadelphia area this week. Pennsylvania has a stay-at-home order in place for non-essential workers until 8 May that has led to protests by anti-lockdown groups.\nIn a statement released last week, Boeing said it would require face coverings, offer voluntary temperature screening and stagger start times so there will be fewer employees coming and going at the same time.\n\u201cThis phased approach ensures we have a reliable supply base, our personal protective equipment is readily available and we have all of the necessary safety measures in place to resume essential work for our customers,\u201d Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and senior executive in the Pacific north-west, said.\nThe company also said all employees able to work from home can continue to do so. And if a worker does get coronavirus, officials will conduct contact tracing to limit the risk to other workers.\n\u201cWe have talked about the prospect of Boeing reopening because they are essential, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve committed to a robust use of PPE [personal protective equipment] and workplace hygiene,\u201d Inslee said during a press conference. \u201cWe hope to get more details on that, and our agencies will keep talking with them to ensure workers feel safe going to work.\u201d\nWashington, which reported the first case of coronavirus in the US and for weeks documented the most cases in the country, has since made progress with flattening the curve of infections thanks to its early and comprehensive response.\nBut as numbers continue to rise, officials have been wary about easing restrictions. As of Saturday, the state has confirmed more than 11,700 cases, including 634 deaths.\nMore than a dozen Boeing employees in the Puget Sound region have been infected with coronavirus, including one worker in Everett who died after getting the virus, according to the Seattle Times.\nIn a letter sent to members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 751, which represents about 32,000 Boeing machinists in the Puget Sound region, the union clarified that employees do have the option to stay home.\nIf an employee is high-risk, needs to care for children, has a sick family member, or is simply worried about working at the facilities during the pandemic, they can use vacation, sick leave or excused leave without pay (LWOP), the letter explained. Some of these employees may also qualify for unemployment insurance benefits.\nBut for those who will be returning, the letter stressed that they \u201chave a right to a safe work environment and should be provided with all the proper personal protective equipment\u201d.\nAfter the news broke that Boeing would be reopening its facilities in Washington, workers and local community members alike took to social media to speak out. While there were some who expressed their relief that the facilities were opening and predicted this could prompt additional businesses to follow suit, many others voiced their concern about what this could mean for their health and that of their loved ones.\nOne woman posted on Facebook that she is a pregnant wife of a Boeing employee and wants the facilities to stay closed until it is safe.\n\u201cPutting your life and possibly a unborn child\u2019s [sic] life in jeopardy isn\u2019t something I\u2019d like to do thank you very much! How are they going to prevent this from spreading,\u201d she wrote.\nAn inspector at Boeing, who works off-site at the company\u2019s supplier partners, told the Guardian that he\u2019s not as concerned for his safety at work, as he believes the threat of the virus has been \u201csomewhat blown out of proportion\u201d. But the employee, who will return to work on Wednesday, questioned Boeing\u2019s classification as essential and the fact that it is reopening before the stay-home order expires.\n\u201cI\u2019m not anywhere near essential,\u201d said the worker, who asked for his name to not be included to protect his job. \u201cI\u2019m not an emergency responder, I don\u2019t work in the food service industry. How is what I do essential to the economy other than helping to keep those suppliers running?\u201d",

        "content": "With the pandemic shutting down most of America, this year\u2019s star prospects will discover their new teams by video link\nIt\u2019s almost inconceivable now to think that this week\u2019s NFL draft was supposed to take place amid the glitz of Las Vegas. Parties galore. Drafted players hugging the commissioner with the Bellagio fountains dancing in the background. A cacophony of cheers and boos from a packed crowd.\nThen came Covid-19. Now, aside from the dates (23-25 April), everything about the three-day spectacle has changed. It will instead take place in a virtual format with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s basement serving as the new stage.\nIn a normal year, viewers in the US would have their choice of three different broadcasts, from ESPN, NFL Network and ABC (an option introduced last year and geared toward casual fans).\nGiven the new, post-lockdown landscape, NFL Network and ESPN decided to merge their resources into one unified broadcast from ESPN HQ in Bristol, Connecticut. A barren studio will be graced solely by Trey Wingo. Suzy Kolber will conduct player interviews (by video) while an array of reporters and analysts will participate from home. Talent from the two networks will be mixed and matched. This means that ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper and NFL Network\u2019s Daniel Jeremiah, typically competitors in the draft space, will likely appear on air together. \u201cThe idea is to use the people and their expertise regardless of which network we work for,\u201d says NFL Network executive Mark Quenzel. \u201cThis is the best thing for NFL fans.\u201d\nABC\u2019s show will also be produced by ESPN. Last year it featured a litany of human interest stories, had an audience of 46% women and drew in a big audience.\nSince media is deemed an essential business, there will be producers running both the ESPN and ABC telecasts from a control room in Bristol. But the number will be half of a typical crew and, as mandated by the state of Connecticut, they must maintain social distance and wear face coverings. Communicating in real time through a mask to an army of feeds projected to be somewhere between 170 and 180 will pose quite the challenge.\nThe 58 prospects invited to attend the virtual draft will double as cameramen. The NFL is counting on each player to set up two cameras. One for up-close reaction shots, the other a wide shot of the room. NFL agent Nicole Lynn, who represents tackle Jedrick Wills and quarterback Jalen Hurts, says her clients were told the wide-shot camera will capture them simulating the traditional \u201cwalk to the stage\u201d. At that point they will have some type of congratulatory virtual interaction with Goodell.\nWell, everything. During the first of several trial runs, there were reportedly multiple issues from general managers not muting themselves during a conference call to problems with bandwidth.\nI was on the phone with a head coach talking about the mock draft today and he was losing his mind because his Internet went down...apparently his young children were all on their iPads using up the band width. \u201c everybody get off the Internet\u201d-in loud dad voice. I hung up.\nThe league\u2019s tech wizards will be working overtime to minimize the issues but technology and uncharted waters don\u2019t often mix well.\nThen there are the prospects themselves. A player could mistakenly curse on camera \u2013 an understandable reaction if you\u2019ve just been drafted by the New York Jets. He could also, God forbid, drink a brand of soda that isn\u2019t an official NFL sponsor. He could break lockdown restrictions by sneaking some buddies in to celebrate. Most likely, we\u2019ll see a litany of minor technical bumps. Last Friday\u2019s WNBA virtual draft featured everything from glitchy screens to newly drafted Chennedy Carter putting her commissioner interview on speaker phone, causing a severe echo.\n\n \u201cClearly we\u2019re there to draft players but more clearly we\u2019re setting the tone that we understand there\u2019s something much larger going on in the world,\u201d says Quenzel of NFL Network. To that end, the NFL is turning its three-day event into a Draft-a-Thon where viewers can donate to help with Covid-19 relief efforts. The charity drive will feature a collection of celebrities and athletes such as Deion Sanders and Kevin Hart. Quenzel says the broadcast will place an equal emphasis on soliciting donations and saying a \u201cproper thank you\u201d to first responders, grocery store workers and other professionals risking their lives to keep society running.\nBack in March, multiple general managers, including the Saints\u2019 Mickey Loomis, pushed to have the draft postponed. But that was never a serious consideration for the 32 NFL team owners, who voted unanimously to proceed as scheduled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have normalcy,\u201d Goodell told NFL Network\u2019s Rich Eisen last week. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in a way that demonstrates that you can continue to do what you need to do in this country and do it safely at home.\u201d\nThe league\u2019s show-must-go-on mentality extends to the regular season. Goodell has given no indication the new season will be delayed, despite red flags such as California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s assertion last week that gatherings \u201cin the hundreds\u201d are \u201cnot on the cards\u201d any time soon.\nIf the regular season were to begin in September as usual, delaying the draft would impede a rookie\u2019s ability to acclimate to his team\u2019s playbook, engage in team offseason programs, and get a contract signed.\n\n Absolutely. Between an oversaturated NFL calendar, a commissioner who\u2019s not exactly a dynamo, and a rulebook thicker than a Dostoevsky novel, the NFL can often feel a tad soulless and manufactured.\nOf course there will be elements of too much polish in this draft as it\u2019s an official NFL event. But the increased probability of error during the broadcast, may add a refreshing layer of vulnerability and imperfection that we can all relate to these days.",

        "content": "British government is facing criticism for not taking part in joint purchase of supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic\nThe British government is coming under fire for failing to join the EU\u2019s procurement scheme for medical equipment, including masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, testing kits and ventilators, at a time when NHS health workers across the country are crying out for more supplies. In the latest twist, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was forced to deny claims, later retracted, by the government\u2019s senior diplomat that it had been a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to opt out of the scheme.\nThe British government signed the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement in 2014 after the H1N1 pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in the access and purchasing power of EU countries to obtain pandemic vaccines and medicines.\nUnder the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government has the right to take part until 31 December 2020. The purpose of the scheme is to allow participants to act together as a big block purchaser, securing the best prices and forcing the way to the front of the queue at a time of shortage.\nSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has launched four calls for tender for medical equipment and supplies. It invited companies to supply gloves and surgical gowns on 28 February, personal protective equipment (PPE) for eye and respiratory protection on 15 March and medical ventilators and respiratory equipment on the same day. A final call to companies to supply laboratory equipment, including testing kits, was made on 19 March. The total value of PPE being purchased is about \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn). The EU ceiling for purchases of ventilators is \u20ac790m. The first call for tender of PPE on 28 February failed because of a lack of suitable suppliers. It was relaunched on 12 March. Since then all four calls for tender have successfully found companies willing to supply the goods to the scale and quality required. The timeline for delivery varies. Some of the PPE is expected imminently. There is a longer time-frame for deliveries of ventilators with the EU warning member states that it could take as long as a year for the all the machines to arrive.\nWhen it emerged last month that the UK was not involved in the EU\u2019s bulk purchase of ventilators despite being aware of its existence and purpose, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK had not joined as the country was \u201cnot in the EU\u201d. That line changed within 24 hours and a communications error was blamed. An email from the European commission inviting the UK to join had been sent to an out-of-date and defunct address. When the Guardian reported last week that there had been multiple opportunities to be involved with the purchase of PPE, as well as ventilators, further details had emerged of the communications error. The UK, it was said, had only received an invitation to sit on the the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement steering group on the 19 March. By then all four of the procurements had been organised.\nThe Foreign Office\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, flatly contradicted the explanation of the UK\u2019s opt-out during an appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee. \u201cIt was a political decision,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.\u201d The comments raised concerns that Brexit ideology had been put before the practicalities of saving lives.\nWithin an hour, Hancock denied the decision had been politically motivated\u201d. Shortly afterwards, McDonald issued a formal correction in a letter to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. \u201cMinisters were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate,\u201d McDonald wrote.\nHancock and Helen Whately, the care minister, pointed out on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning that the EU\u2019s scheme has yet to deliver any medical supplies. It has also been suggested by anonymous government officials to various media outlets that the UK is now part of a procurement of therapeutics and products required for vaccines.\nIn reality, no such new procurements have yet been launched. As for the ongoing procurements, eight suppliers have offered PPE products in excess of that being ordered by the participating member states, and deliveries are expected to European healthcare workers shortly.",

Dividends aren\u2019t all bad, given the number of fixed-income folks who rely on them. But still 80% of shares are owned by the wealthiest 10%. Pay the people who make the magic happen with respect and dignity they have more than earned from you. This company must do better.\u201d\nOK, I've been holding my tongue on the theory that a pandemic is no time to be calling people out on anything other than failing us in a public health sense.  I thought it might be a moment for peace and reconciliation.  But I feel a thread coming on....1/ https://t.co/G1mUq7RmAV\nTop Disney executives have made salary sacrifices to \u201cbetter enable the company to weather the extraordinary business challenges\u201d. Iger gave up the remainder of his $3m salary for this year, while Bob Chapek, who recently replaced Iger as chief executive, will forgo half his $2.5m base salary.\n\u201cSalary is a drop in the bucket to these guys,\u201d Disney tweeted. \u201cThe real payday is in the rest of the package.\u201d\nThe company has protected those lucrative incentive schemes. Iger earned a total of $65.6m in 2018 and $47m last year. His latest package is more than 900 times that of the median Disney worker\u2019s earnings, which stands at about $52,000.\nChapek could potentially receive an annual bonus \u201cof not less than 300%\u201d of salary, in addition to a long-term incentive award of \u201cnot less than $15m\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a role with the company,\u201d Disney tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m just a citizen who cares. But I am an heir. And I do carry this name with me everywhere. And I have a conscience which makes it very difficult for me to sit by when I see abuses taking place with that name attached to them.\u201d\nSuspending the pay of nearly half its workforce will save Disney up to $500m a month across its theme parks and hotels, which have been shut in Europe, the US and Asia for weeks. The decision means Disney staff are reliant on benefits in the country where they work.",

They also requested \u201cunderlying documents that explain why the [defence department] withheld the numbers\u201d.\n\u201cThe United States Government and all its institutions represent and are accountable to the American people,\u201d the former defence secretary Chuck Hagel wrote in support of the requests. \u201cThe public and those who serve and defend this country and their families are entitled to know where we are sending our service men and women, why, and the numbers. That\u2019s democracy. The Government works for the people.\u201d\nRyan Goodman, the co-editor of Just Security and a former Pentagon legal adviser said: \u201cProviding this information would be a show of respect for the American public, who ultimately must decide what sacrifices our country should make in sending troops into war.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s decision to stop publishing troop numbers ended a decade-long policy of transparency started in the George W Bush administration. In December 2017, the Pentagon\u2019s defence manpower data centre published its quarterly report with blank spaces where troop numbers in combat zones would normally be. Corresponding figures for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were also stripped retroactively from the previously released September report.\nThe decision to remove the data from the Pentagon website was the initiative of former defence secretary James Mattis, according to retired army Lt General Thomas Spoehr.\n\u201cHe became convinced the Department of Defence was revealing too much information publicly,\u201d Spoehr, head of the center for national defense at the Heritage Foundation, said. \u201cI could never find a written memo, but he essentially told all the services to clamp down on what they were releasing to the public.\u201d\nIn the move to greater secrecy, Mattis drew support from the president. In August 2017, Trump said in a speech in Virginia. \u201cWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities \u2026 America\u2019s enemies must never know our plans, or believe they can wait us out.\u201d\nGoodman said such reasoning was contradictory. \u201cI think the public justification has crystallized around the idea of operational security \u2013 \u2018we don\u2019t want to tell the enemy\u2019 \u2013 in part because it is such an easy, off-the-shelf explanation to present,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that makes no sense given the long period in which the military has released these numbers to the public without hesitation.\u201d\nSpoehr argued that Mattis had gone too far in withdrawing information from the public domain, but argued for a compromise in which approximate figures were disclosed, and with greater secrecy for Syrian operations, which tend to be more covert.\nTroop numbers are also politically sensitive, particularly in an election year, as Trump has made his vows to bring US troops home from Afghanistan and the Middle East one of the central planks to his campaign message.\n\u201cOf all the things that DoD has done to limit public access to information, this is probably the most egregious,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists government secrecy project. \u201cThe idea that the scale of the US military presence in a war zone should be kept secret from the public is a mistake. That\u2019s not how democracies fight or win wars.\u201d",

Plus, how Muslims are marking Ramadan in isolation\nGood morning. In case you were beginning to feel optimistic about the flattening of the coronavirus curve, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a stark warning: the second wave of Covid-19 infections could prove \u201ceven more difficult\u201d for the US than the first. If such a surge comes during the winter months, Robert Redfield told the Washington Post on Tuesday, it would coincide with the regular annual flu season, when the healthcare system is already strained.\nThe coronavirus has now killed more than 44,000 people in the US and 175,000 worldwide.\nTrump\u2019s favourite malaria drug is not a miracle cure \u2026 The president has touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for Covid-19. But an analysis of its use in US veterans hospitals found more deaths among those who were given the drug than those who received standard care.\n\u2026 and nor is bleach. The US government is taking legal action against pseudoscience groups peddling a potentially dangerous quack cure for coronavirus: bleach solution.\nThe president has framed his latest plan to tackle the pandemic \u2013 a 60-day ban on immigration to the US \u2013 as an effort to protect US workers from foreign competition. His executive order, which could be extended beyond two months, \u201cwill help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens\u201d, he said. On Tuesday Trump also pledged to prop up the oil and gas industry, as the price of US crude again fell below zero.\nIn times of national tragedy, the president traditionally acts as America\u2019s consoler-in-chief, writes David Smith. But Trump is less concerned with the human cost of the crisis than he is with its economic cost \u2013 and the threat to his own political future:\nThe message Trump delivers each day in press briefings seems to be motivated more by his quest for re-election than any fellow feeling for beleaguered Americans.\nMost business leaders now expect a lengthy global recession to result from the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey of more than 3,000 chief executives in 109 countries by the business leadership network YPO. The boss of one Singapore-based health services firm said: \u201cWe have not seen a crisis like this for over 100 years, and some household names will not survive.\u201d\nAt last, a lifeline for small businesses. The US Senate has passed a new $500bn aid package for small firms, after the first congressional coronavirus bailout was criticised for appearing to favour big business.\nNetflix enjoys a subscriber boom. The streaming service is a rare lockdown success story, adding 15.77 million new customers over the past three months \u2013 more than double the number it had forecast.\nAlmost 20,000 Georgians have tested positive for the coronavirus, at least 86 died on Sunday and Monday alone, and the state still has no way to conduct widespread testing. But the governor, Brian Kemp, has joined the governors of Florida and South Carolina in planning to reopen parts of their states\u2019 economies over the weekend, a decision decried by the mayor of Savannah as \u201creckless, premature and dangerous\u201d. The situation pits Kemp, a white Republican, against Georgia\u2019s mostly black Democratic mayors.\nIn Wisconsin, by contrast, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, is facing a legal challenge to his stay-at-home order from GOP state leaders, as the question of coronavirus lockdowns across the US becomes increasingly political and partisan.\nSouth Dakota won\u2019t stay at home. Some governors refused to issue stay-at-home orders in the first place, including South Dakota, whose governor, Kristi Noem, told Fox News: \u201cSo many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security, and they don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\nMissouri sues China. The Republican-led state of Missouri is suing China over the coronavirus, claiming the Chinese government is to blame for the pandemic.\nAn IVF toad offers hope in an age of extinction. Olaf, from an endangered species of Puerto Rican toad, recently hatched at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. As the first amphibian to be born from frozen sperm, his example shows that scientists could bank frozen sperm and eggs to protect the genetic lineage of threatened species.\nThe death toll from a shooting in Nova Scotia is now 22. Police in Canada revised up the number of victims of the weekend rampage, the country\u2019s worst mass shooting of modern times, after more were publicly identified.\nHow many US troops are in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria? The Pentagon stopped publishing the numbers two years ago, but the Trump administration may now be forced to reveal them following a Freedom of Information Act request.\nRamadan in a time of plague\nUnder normal circumstances, the holy month of Ramadan would be a time when mosques are crowded and iftar dinners stretch into the early hours. But in the Covid-19 era, Muslim places of worship will be deserted and day-long fasts broken in isolation, as Guardian journalists report from across the Islamic world.\nHow historians are documenting the pandemic\nThe New-York Historical Society has started accumulating photos and ephemera related to the coronavirus, for a collection aimed at teaching future generations about the crisis. \u201cWe hope people will be able to learn from it and be better prepared in an event like this in the future,\u201d the museum\u2019s director tells Nadja Sayej.\nJameela Jamil: \u2018I am a human, prone to error\u2019\nThe Good Place star is launching a new podcast and a YouTube show.

        "content": "An intense, relentless, brilliant encounter that exhausted those playing, watching and commentating \nFalse memories are a known psychological phenomenon. Sometimes, when we think back on past events, we remember incorrect details with certainty, our brains blending truth and untruth: things we witnessed first-hand with stories we have been told since.\nIs it still right to call the memory false, though, if we have deliberately allowed it to be distorted in this way? I know I watched Italy\u2019s 2006 World Cup semi-final win over Germany on ITV, on a shared television in temporary halls of residence at Highbury College in Portsmouth. I was studying for my NCTJ journalism qualifications and we had been booted out of our previous accommodation due to a double-booking right before starting our exams.\nYet when I think back on Fabio Grosso\u2019s extra-time goal, it is not the voice of Clive Tyldesley I hear. Instead, the backing track is Fabio Caressa of Italy\u2019s Sky Sport, screaming himself hoarse. \u201cThe ball is cut out. It\u2019s Pirlo, Pirlo, Pirlo, still Pirlo, heel, shot ... GOOOOAL! GOOOOAL! GOOOOAL! Grosso! Grosso! GOOOOAL! Goal from Grosso! Goal from Grosso! Goal from Grosso! One minute left!\u201d\nThere is no clever wordplay, no crafted metaphor or iconic line. Yet Caressa\u2019s commentary was perfection because it captured the moment so absolutely. He was exhausted and exhilarated, running on fumes and emotion. So was Grosso, as he wheeled away screaming \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u201d \u2013 his outstretched arms and shaking head evoking memories of Marco Tardelli 24 years before.\nSo, frankly, were the rest of us. These had been 119 of the most intense World Cup minutes: a relentless back-and-forth between two of the sport\u2019s foremost nations. The game remained deadlocked only because Lukas Podolski couldn\u2019t beat Gianluigi Buffon at the end of a five-on-five, while Alberto Gilardino and Gianluca Zambrotta hit the woodwork of a goal they concluded to be cursed.\nBy the time Italy scored, they had four centre-forwards on the pitch. Marcello Lippi sent on Vincenzo Iaquinta to replace one winger at the start of extra time and then Alessandro Del Piero for the other in the 104th minute. Gilardino had already come on for Luca Toni in a like-for-like swap, while Francesco Totti played the full duration. So, of course, the stalemate had to be broken by a left-back.\nGrosso had originally been brought to the tournament as a reserve. He was in the middle of a respectable but unremarkable career before choosing this moment \u2013 followed up with a winning penalty at the end of the shootout in the final \u2013 to write his name for ever into World Cup lore.\nHis shot was curled on an unstoppable trajectory round the despairing dive of Jens Lehmann but Grosso never sought to claim it as some moment of nerveless skill. \u201cI tried to hit the ball with whatever strength I had left,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, it went how it went.\u201d\nThere was genuine artistry in the assist from Pirlo, seizing the ball after it was headed clear from a corner. His first thought was to shoot, but with three defenders closing in on his touch he released Grosso instead using a no-look pass. \u201cHe always used to tell me to \u2018just go\u2019,\u201d said the full-back. \u201cHe would say: \u2018I\u2019ll find a way to see you.\u2019\u201d\nThe epilogue was almost as perfect. Not long after the restart, Fabio Cannavaro intercepted a cross and charged forward with inexplicable energy to win the ball again from Podolski 10 yards ahead. Italy broke and Gilardino demonstrated impressive cool of his own to cut a reverse pass for Del Piero, who beat Lehmann.\nAs an Italian, it was perfect: 118 minutes of suffering all made worthwhile by the last two. A win, a place in the World Cup final, another excuse to dance around to Seven Nation Army in that summer when it had become our song and not yet just another generic stadium tune.\nIn Portsmouth, a group of Italian schoolkids spilled out of a neighbouring hall of residence \u2013 where they were staying while doing a language course. I leaned out the window and cheered with them. Later, I \u2013 and no doubt they \u2013 would watch back on YouTube with Caressa\u2019s commentary, enhancing the memory with every view.",

Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost an average of 16 tonnes of fresh water per square metre since 1997.\nSummer temperatures in parts of Europe were as much as 3C to 4C higher than normal in 2019, the report said, with heatwaves in June and July breaking records in France and Germany.\nThe data confirms other findings that show a clearly warming trend globally. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also produced its final report for 2019, confirming that last year was globally the second hottest on record, with the oceans reaching the highest temperatures ever recorded.\nWednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.\nBut the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a \u201ca collective call for transformative action for our planet\u201d.\nAmong the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.\nOn Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.\nPetteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO, said that although the coronavirus crisis would probably result in a temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions, it would also make it harder to help people afflicted by the impact of climate breakdown. He warned that ignoring the climate crisis would have a greater impact than the pandemic.\n\u201cWhilst Covid-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human wellbeing, ecosystems and economies for centuries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves. We need to show the same determination and unity against climate change as against Covid-19. We need to act together in the interests of the health and welfare of humanity, not just for the coming weeks and months but for many generations ahead.\u201d\nGlobally, the past five-year mean temperatures were 1.1C above pre-industrial levels, taking the world closer to the 2C threshold, beyond which scientists say climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. All countries are bound by the Paris agreement to hold global heating rises to no more than 2C, though the US is withdrawing from the accord.\nCarlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which compiled the European State of the Climate 2019 report, on behalf of the European Commission, said: \u201cOne exceptional warm year does not constitute a warming trend, but with detailed information from our operational services, that covers many different aspects of our climate, we are able to connect the dots to learn more about how it is changing.\u201d\nThe reports were published to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which is being celebrated online around the world.",

The fourth pandemic (1863-1875) began in the Ganges Delta, travelled with Muslim pilgrims to Mecca and then to Russia, Africa, North America and Europe. In 1866, the epidemic spread with the Austro-Prussian war, while a localised outbreak in the East End of London claimed over 5,000 lives with many other cases appearing across the UK. The following year, 113,000 lives were lost to it in Italy.\n7 August 1866\nThe study of the course of the cholera wave in its advance upon this country is by no means a thing of merely scientific or historical interest. The evidence is complete that the disease is one which reaches us by importation; and, although it gathers and is intensified in unhealthy places, it moves along the lines of human intercommunication. On this occasion the infection of Europe was accomplished in May of last year by the return of the Mahometan pilgrims to Egypt from Mecca, where the disease was epidemic; thence it was carried along each of the lines of steam communication which connect Alexandria with the ports of the Levant and the south of Europe. From these ports it spread inland in each case. What is particularly remarkable in the present epidemic is the rapidity of its progress through Europe.

Since the 10th instant, there have been 43 cases and 23 deaths. During the past week cholera is reported to have made great advances in Winsford, more persons having died than the aggregate number of deaths during the previous three weeks.\nThe Lancet says: Cholera has broken out seriously in several parts of the kingdom. A rapid succession of cases has occurred in Liverpool, Llanelly Southampton, and the east of London; and the special powers entrusted to the Privy Council for the mitigation of epidemic maladies by the Diseases Prevention Act of 1855 have been put in operation. By this act the Privy Council is empowered to issue directions and regulations for the speedy internment of the dead, for house to house visitation, for dispensing medicines, guarding against the spread of disease, and affording to persons afflicted by or threatened with the epidemic such medical aid and accommodation as may be required.\n20 July 1866\nAt the present season, with a temperature so productive of disease, and the cholera already with its foot upon our threshold, and threatening a fatal descent, the annual report of Mr Simon, the medical officer of the Privy Council, is more than usually interesting and instructive. In one sense it may be said that it tells nothing new. Most of us were aware already that the poorer class of population in our large towns was miserably overcrowded, that sanitary science was more a matter of theory than of practice, that the local authorities were called upon to act under legislation which armed them with ambiguous and imperfect powers, and that in too many cases the authorities themselves were eager to avail themselves of any confusion in the law to shirk the responsibility devolved upon them.\nBut there are things which, however well known, cannot be too often repeated. The full force of these facts in connection with the spread of disease and the means which may be taken for its prevention are still but feebly appreciated. In a country like our own, with our habits of political independence and our tendency to resent arbitrary legislation, the Government can do little to enforce precautions for the preservation of the public health, except through the agency of public opinion; and, unfortunately, this is just one of those subjects upon which public opinion is dull and sluggish. People admit the facts, which, indeed, are too flagrant and notorious to be denied, but do not or will not see their way to the obvious conclusion. There are even well-educated persons who, when you talk to them of the poisonous influences of bad air and bad water, sneer at the over-refinement of the age.\nOur grandfathers knew nothing of these new-fangled sanitary notions, and were not frightened out of their wits at an unpleasant smell; yet they got on very well; and so might we, if we would only not think about these things so much.\nBut population was very far from being so dense in our grandfathers\u2019 days; and the conditions of infection vary, of course, with the close contact of population subject to the same deficiencies of fresh air and water. And, even in former days, if less was said then about the fatal consequences of neglecting sanitary laws, it was because less was known. Looking back now, with our present experience, we can readily account for a large proportion of the mortality which seemed so mysterious at the time. The truths which Mr Simon preaches, threadbare and hackneyed as they seem, cannot, therefore, be too much impressed on the public mind, in order that an active and sound opinion may be created on the subject.\nMr Simon, in the new report, states in a very clear concise manner the principles of contagion. It is a popular error, he says, to suppose that the medical profession is divided into two camps of \u201ccontagionists\u201d and \u201canti-contagionists.\u201d It is an elementary truth in medicine, about which no difference exists, that disease is spread by infection; only there are personal as well as local differences of susceptibility to contagion. Typhus and typhoid fevers, for instance, which, amid over-crowding, and non-ventilation, and refuse odours, and foul water supply, would develop into a pestilence, carrying its ravages far and wide, will, in a clear atmosphere, with a pure water supply, be so restricted in their contagious effects that typhoid fever will scarcely be recognised as infectious, nor even typhus extend beyond limits which admit of being narrowly defined. But, further, even where a certain number of families are subject to the same external conditions, some families will suffer worse then others, and one member of a family may survive what the others succumb to. Besides, apart from such influences as the above, it seems doubtful whether all contagious diseases are equally capable of pandemic extension; and Mr Simon cites the instances of scarlatina and typhus, neither of which has shown much disposition to spread in Asia or Africa.\nThere are many puzzles, no doubt, in the philosophy of contagion. Certain diseases spring up for a while, and then subside, to re-appear again after a lapse of years. But the general principle of infection is now, Mr Simon contends, sufficiently established, and must be recognised in all measures for the protection of the public health.\nThere are two modes of dealing with contagious diseases. One is to bar them out by means of a rigid quarantine; the other is to establish such a degree of cleanliness and careful observance of sanitary laws as to reduce to a minimum any predisposition to disease. As to the first, Mr Simon confesses a theoretical preference for it, only he does not see how it can possibly be carried out. Not only as regards cholera, but generally as regards all contagious disease, it is now certain that contagions current on the continent of Europe must be deemed virtually current in England.\nOn the other hand, a system of quarantine exists in England only in name; and if one is to be called into action it has first to be created. To extemporise a cordon sanitaire is utterly impossible; and a quarantine which is partial and ineffective is only a vexatious and irrational derangement of commerce. Mr Simon doubts whether England could submit to the isolation involved in a system of rigid and comprehensive quarantine. Not only the obviously sick, but the possibly sick, must be kept at a distance. Nobody could be admitted into the country, however excellent apparently in health, until he had passed a period of probation in perfectly non-infectious circumstances,\nMr Simon sums up the case against quarantine in a way which seems to us unanswerable. Considering what inconvenience to persons, what interruption to commerce, such restrictions involve, on how vast a scale and for what indefinite duration of time they must be enforced,\nno one can expect, in regard to great trading communities, that governments, if they go so far as to enact, will have much success in enforcing, quarantine. Against the efficiency of it, when enacted, there operate some of the strongest of law-breaking influences \u2013 on the one hand, instincts of contempt for the narrow self-protectiveness which it represents and on the other, those eager commercial interests which now mainly govern the world.\nAbsolute quarantine would be insufferable, partial quarantine would be inoperative, for let the restrictions be relaxed or evaded in only a single case, and the whole mischief might be done which an elaborate and costly machinery had been provided to prevent. So far we agree with Mr Simon; but at the same time we think there are exceptional cases where, in the face of grave and imminent danger, quarantine might be temporarily established \u2013 to the extent, for instance, of having a medical examination of passengers arriving direct from any place abroad where the cholera is known to he raging virulently, and of keeping them apart for a few days from the rest of the community. Such precautions might mitigate, though they certainly could not be trusted altogether to prevent, the spread of disease.\nPutting quarantine aside, we have still another mode of coping with contagion from abroad; and that is to keep up the public health to such degree as to be able to resist its fatal influence. The overcrowding of population demands a serious attention; and Mr Simon\u2019s report to the Privy Council offers some valuable suggestions as to the best means of checking the evil. The law is at present very vague and imperfect; and among chief amendments required are the following:\u2013\nThat over-crowding should be declared a nuisance, the sole test of its existence being the proportion borne by the number of occupants to the size and ventilation of a given space; that what are called the \u201ctenement houses\u201d of the poor should be dealt with in the same manner as common lodging houses; that cellar dwellings should be prohibited; and that the local authorities should be empowered to acquire premises, by compulsory sale, either in order to make needful openings and clearings where ground is too closely built upon, or for other improvements.\nThere is another point of great importance to which Mr Simon alludes. At present any person suffering from a contagious disorder practically scatters his infection broadcast almost where he will. Subject to the conditions that proper hospital accommodation can be offered, the authorities ought, it is urged, to be able to require that anyone having a dangerous contagious disease should, in regard to residence and otherwise, so conduct himself as not unnecessarily to multiply the chances of extending infection to others. There are obviously difficulties in the way of enforcing this; but the principle is sound, and has hitherto been too much overlooked.",

        "content": "Police say villagers were killed, most beheaded or shot, after some refused to join extremists\nAn Islamist extremist group in northern Mozambique has killed dozens of villagers in its most bloody attack.\nMore than 50 people were massacred in an attack in Xitaxi in Muidumbe district after locals refused to be recruited to its ranks, according to police cited by local media. Most were either shot dead or beheaded.\n\u201cThe criminals tried to recruit young people to join their ranks, but there was resistance. This provoked the anger of the criminals, who indiscriminately killed \u2013 cruelly and diabolically \u2013 52 young people,\u201d police spokesman Orlando Mudumane told the state-owned broadcasting service.\nThe attack occurred more than two weeks ago but details have only emerged now.\nMilitants have stepped up attacks in recent weeks as part of a campaign to establish an Islamist caliphate in the gas-rich region, seizing government buildings, blocking roads and briefly hoisting a black-and-white flag carrying religious symbols over towns and villages across Cabo Delgado province. The flag is also used by Isis and other Islamic extremists.\nIn March, the insurgents briefly occupied the centre of Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, a district headquarters, burning government facilities, including a barracks, and brandishing banners of affiliation to the so-called Islamic State.\nA day later a second town was raided and the district police headquarters badly damaged. Those attackers too carried an Islamic State flag. Twenty to 30 members of Mozambique\u2019s security forces were killed in both attacks, observers said.\nLocal security forces suffer from poor training, minimal equipment and low morale. Attempts to reinforce with expensive foreign mercenaries do not appear to have been effective.\nAt least 150 Russians linked to the Wagner Group, a company that has supplied mercenaries to fight in several African countries, were deployed last year but were forced to withdraw after suffering casualties.\nThe insurgency in the remote north began to grow about two years ago, exploiting widespread anger at the failure of central government to fairly distribute earnings from exploitation of the region\u2019s rich natural resources. Discontent was exacerbated by endemic corruption and a brutal, indiscriminate military response to the violence.\nThe insurgents have so far mainly targeted isolated villages, killing more than 900 people, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled).\nThe unrest has forced hundreds of thousands of locals to flee and raised concern among big energy firms operating in the region.\nMore than 200,000 people have fled the area hit worst by the violence, according to a local Catholic archbishop, Dom Luiz Fernando.\nSome have sought refuge among friends and relatives in the port city of Pemba, the capital of Cabo Delgado.\nAn organisation calling itself Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP), affiliated with Isis, has claimed some of the attacks in the region since last year.\nThe insurgents are known locally as al-Shabaab (\u201cthe youth\u201d), although they have no known links to the extremist group of that name operating in Somalia.\nThe massacre happened on the same day, 7 April, that local sources in Muidumbe told AFP that militants went on a rampage, burning bridge construction equipment and ransacking schools, hospitals and a bank. Before the raid, the attackers used loudhailers to warn villagers \u201cnot to run away but stay inside the house\u201d, the source said.\nIn the same district, the militants recorded a video of themselves addressing locals in the region\u2019s local vernacular of Kimwani and Swahili.\nExperts say there is \u201cno quick fix\u201d to the problems underlying the insurgency.\n\u201cMost importantly, the Mozambican military and security forces need to be restructured \u2026 They now face a complex, multilayered and asymmetrical conflict, mostly drawing upon local and regional grievances and networks but increasingly also attracting some limited encouragement and advice from further afield,\u201d Alex Vines, the director of the Africa programme at Chatham House, wrote last month.",

Over the last week or two I\u2019ve seen Primer, Shane Carruth\u2019s rather brilliant debut, made for $7,000. It\u2019s a sort of naturalistic sci-fi, brilliantly conceived and made with such an unfussy, assured tone.\nWe watched a couple of Joseph Losey films \u2013 I thought I might warm to him more but haven\u2019t. I liked the Brazilian film Bacurau a lot. Kleber Filho\u2019s other film, Neighbouring Sounds, is good too.\nI\u2019ve been watching Outnumbered with the kids. The writing is so good and the kids get a lot out of seeing versions of their own flailing parents represented on screen.\nThe experience so far has confirmed what I already suspected: I am nothing like as good a parent as Ma [Brie Larson\u2019s character] in Room; not as patient or resourceful. The TV would have been on 24/7 had it been me in charge. I suppose that the idea we were trying to capture is that scale is relative, that if you really pay attention to where you are there is more there than you think.\nWe\u2019ve been at home so much and it is true that the place feels larger and more varied than it would crashing in at night after a day working. There are bad days but we are lucky in that we have enough space and a garden, and crucially an excellent dog. Most days are all right and it turns out that the place, or the idea of the place, is elastic enough to contain it all.\nI\u2019m not often drawn to films about contagions or global disasters or whatever. The high concept takes up so much energy when all the fundamental stuff about people is present in ordinary life. Maybe great work will come out of this moment but I\u2019d bet it won\u2019t be about the pandemic, not directly anyway.\nNormal People is available in full on the BBC iPlayer on 26 April; weekly double episodes begin on BBC One on 27 April.",

Most of these are reported from the west of Germany.\nThe blue tit is found across Europe and is one of the most common visitors to UK gardens. They eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts and can be spotted all year round in the UK, with the exception of some Scottish islands.\n  According to NABU, symptoms of the diseased birds include breathing problems, no longer taking food and making no attempt to escape when approached by people. The group is advising people to stop feeding or providing drinking troughs for birds to reduce the risk of transmission between them. \n  The first laboratory test results on the dead birds have found a bacterial infection (Suttonella ornithocola) that has been known in the UK since the 1990s and which affects birds similarly. The infection was reported in Germany in 2018. Further test results on birds are expected over the next few days.\n  The infection discovered causes pneumonia in tits \u2013 predominantly blue tits \u2013 and they become lethargic with fluffed-up plumage and breathing difficulties. There are no reports of this affecting any other animals apart from birds.\nDr Becki Lawson, a disease specialist at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said she had not yet seen any recent increase in mortality in blue tits or any other garden bird species in the UK. \n  \u201cWe are aware of the recent reports of blue tit mortality from Germany and understand investigations are under way to determine the cause,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cOnce a diagnosis is reached, we will be able to comment on whether the condition affecting blue tit populations in Germany is one that we also see in Great Britain.\u201d \n  A spokesperson for the RSPB said the risk to UK bird populations was currently extremely low. \u201cThis disease predominantly affects blue tits which are largely sedentary birds and do not move far from where they fledged. If this disease is not already present in the UK, transmission across countries from Germany to the UK will be slow,\u201d they said.\n  Members of the public have been urged to report any sick or dead blue tits through Garden Wildlife Health, a monitoring project run between the ZSL, the British Trust for Ornithology, Froglife and the RSPB.",

        "content": "Taking down the fossil fuel industry requires taking on the institutions that finance it. Even during a pandemic, this movement is gaining steam \n1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let\u2019s think outside the pandemic bubble.)\nSimpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel described a permanently yellow horizon: \u201cI not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.\u201d Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: \u201cThe person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller\u2019s are black as coal.\u201d You\u2019ve probably heard of Cleveland\u2019s Cuyahoga River catching fire, but here\u2019s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller described the Hudson south of Albany: \u201cOne great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.\u201d Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America\u2019s cities then.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the first Earth Day in 1970 \u2013 10% of America\u2019s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country\u2019s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a series of photos that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it\u2019s hard to imagine that we tolerated this.\nBut we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we\u2019re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can\u2019t see them.\nThe carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today\u2019s levels you can\u2019t see it or smell it, and it doesn\u2019t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That\u2019s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don\u2019t quite see it.\nAnd it\u2019s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It\u2019s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It\u2019s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There\u2019s no catalytic converter for CO2, which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.\nThat in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and may even own them, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.\nAnd so we are. Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase \u2013 the planet\u2019s largest by market capitalization \u2013 which has funneled a quarter-trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like Liberty Mutual, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL during a pandemic.\nThis campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock announced that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to edge away from coal. And Chase \u2013 well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the protest in January that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there\u2019s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.\nStill, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it\u2019s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.\nOur job \u2013 a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago \u2013 is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as Donald Trump does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That\u2019s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets last September. That\u2019s not 20 million, but it\u2019s on the way.\nWe can\u2019t be on the streets right now. So we\u2019ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for Earth Day Live, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We\u2019re in a race, and we\u2019re gaining fast.\nBill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

She died there on 13 March.\nA failure to properly enforce social distancing in the weeks after coronavirus arrived is also suspected to have played a role.",

        "content": "In an exclusive interview the Norwegian talks about rehab during a pandemic and the importance of female players fighting together\nAda Hegerberg felt something happen to her right knee while training, but she didn\u2019t know what it was. \u201cIt just snapped,\u201d the striker said of the injury sustained before Lyon were due to play Stade de Reims on 26 January. \u201cIt gave this click sound. In a situation you\u2019ve found yourself in 10 times, 10,000 times before. I felt my body shaking. It was a signal. But then I was back on my feet and I didn\u2019t have any pain.\u201d\nWith the muscles around her knee tense, making it hard for the physio and doctor to identify the issue, it was two days before the worst was confirmed via an MRI scan.\nWhen the Norwegian was told she had ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament she was left \u201cnot knowing where to head\u201d \u2013 but she knew her season was over. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very strange feeling. I consider myself to be a very privileged woman and with a wider perspective it\u2019s not the end of the world, but when you\u2019re a footballer and an athlete at a high level it kind of feels like you\u2019re at rock bottom.\u201d\nThe 2018 women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or winner is not used to being on the sidelines. \u201cTouch wood I\u2019ve been quite lucky.\u201d Up until January, she had a remarkably consistent and injury-free career which allowed her to reach 282 goals in 271 appearances, including a record 53 in the Champions League. Perhaps the most impressive thing about those statistics is she is only 24 years old.\nHegerberg has had the sort of twisted fortune, not that she would express it that way, of having the injury in the year that football has been halted by the coronavirus pandemic, but she too has been affected. Rehab is different. More significantly she is separated from her family in Norway, who provided her and her sister Andrine, who plays for Roma, with an environment that enabled them to thrive as players from an early age. She is also, having missed the narrow window to cross the border, separated from her husband, the Lech Poznan defender Thomas Rogne, who is in lockdown in Poland.\nDespite that, she is surprisingly upbeat. \u201cI\u2019m doing fine,\u201d she says cheerfully from her home in Lyon. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. The circumstances are so strange at the moment, I\u2019m just trying to keep home, and I\u2019m lucky to have everything in place from my rehab.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a period where you have a lot of feelings in certain moments.\u201d She says it is crucial to contextualise those moments, to recognise them as \u201cpart of the process\u201d, adding: \u201cSometimes you need to lower expectations and be a bit more gentle to yourself through those difficult periods in order to conquer them.\u201d\nHegerberg adds that it is hard to talk about football because \u201csociety as a whole needs to get in place before football gets in place again\u201d. Yet she is determined to help make sure that women\u2019s football is a key part of discussions when it comes to the sport\u2019s coronavirus recovery.\n\u201cFootball is going to suffer from this, the bigger men\u2019s clubs are going to suffer, everyone\u2019s going to suffer and obviously women\u2019s football is going to suffer. I understand that men\u2019s football is up for discussion first. We also benefit a lot economically from men\u2019s clubs and we need their help, as well, to build a better product and take it to a place which we can benefit from ourselves one day.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just very important to keep women\u2019s football in the discussions at all times. There has been great development in the last years, it\u2019s had a good rhythm, and it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t take two steps back again after a crisis like this because we\u2019re not the first priority. We just have to keep the voice strong and not lose our position. It\u2019s such a strange situation to be in so it\u2019s very hard to say where it will go but we need to push for the same evolution that we\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d\nThis is not the first time the Lyon forward has used her platform to push the game forward, and it won\u2019t be the last. She has used her high profile to drive change, most notably in stepping back from Norway\u2019s national team over a perceived lack of support and investment in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s football, and she has a huge amount of respect for those who do the same.\n\u201cYou have a choice: you could play on and that\u2019s it but I think when you reach a certain level, a lot of responsibility comes with it. It\u2019s important to say, though, that you have to perform too. Because if you don\u2019t perform, you don\u2019t have a voice and then you won\u2019t have the same impact. Fact. So that\u2019s kind of been my biggest motivation from day one; I train every day to perform and also give me a voice.\n\u201cI have a lot of admiration for people who stand up for what they believe in and who actually use the voice for good. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do, to stand up for what I believe is good for the women\u2019s game. I think we need to stand up together and for each other and support each other. That\u2019s why I think that Megan Rapinoe should be respected by footballers around the world, because she\u2019s taken a beating for all of us and for the game and we need strong voices like that. The more voices you have, the more impact you can leave on the sport.\u201d\nIt fits with her philosophy as a player. When people ask what her ambition is her answer is not individual awards and team titles; instead, something much simpler drives her. \u201cMy biggest ambition is to maximise the potential in me. To see how far I can push it as a player at the highest level; that\u2019s something that motivates me.\u201d\nAs does watching a culture shift in Norway as young girls and boys look to her in the way she looked at the ever-modest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r when growing up. \u201cThere was a lack of women role models when I was growing up \u2013 that\u2019s something that has changed a lot today. That\u2019s very important. I can see the impact all the success that I\u2019ve had with Lyon has not only had on young girls but also young boys in Norway. I feel that\u2019s a big game-changer.\u201d\nHegerberg has won everything there is to win at Lyon and, with her teammates Sarah Bouhaddi and Dzsenifer Marozsan set for moves to the United States, could the Norwegian look beyond France when her contract ends in a year? \u201cI believe in staying loyal to your club,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had the most amazing years at Lyon and I have another year of my contract. It\u2019s impossible to say what the future will bring but right now I\u2019m in my own rehab bubble trying to get back on track stronger for Lyon \u2013 I have scary plans for that comeback.\u201d",

        "content": "After being blinded, a young soldier becomes a human listening post in this absorbing but quirky first world war drama\nAlexander Tolotukhin, a 31-year-old film-maker from Belarus and a pupil of Alexander Sokurov, makes his feature film debut with what might be called a brief cine-novella set on the eastern front of the first world war. It certainly shows Sokurov\u2019s influences in its soft, painterly compositions and extensive dubbing that makes the dialogue sound often like a subdued murmur. It also feels like classic Russian movies such as Tarkovsky\u2019s Ivan\u2019s Childhood or Klimov\u2019s Come and See.\nWhat makes it distinctive \u2013 and, unfortunately, not as good as it might have been \u2013 is an odd framing device. We don\u2019t see the film straightforwardly. We periodically see a modern-day orchestra rehearsing the musical score that is to go on it \u2013 pieces by Rachmaninov. This is an interesting quirk in some ways, but the film would have been better without it, impeding as it does your emotional reaction to the drama and not enhancing the musical accompaniment\u2019s meaning.\nYet the story is absorbing. Alexey (Vladimir Korolev) is a fresh-faced boy with troops at the front who is blinded in a gas attack and from then on employed to listen out for advancing German aircraft. He does this at a strange monitoring post with a great funnel, which Alexey is strapped into, like a pilot \u2013 and he does well to warn everyone of an imminent attack. There are grisly episodes: despite his blindness, Alexey is beaten with Dickensian cruelty for spilling food on an officer. He has to have a tick removed from the side of his face with a knife and is always having to shake the lice out of his jacket.\nEventually, the Germans close in, and poor Alexey is not much worse off than his cowed comrades. Perhaps the point is that war makes blind cattle of them all. It is a well-made little film, though the orchestral meta-level was a mistake.\n A Russian Youth is available on Mubi from 30 April.",

        "content": "Despite the PGA\u2019s presidential support, the Ryder Cup will probably have to wait. Rescheduling, though, will be a challenge\nHad the 2020 Ryder Cup been set to take place in Europe, it is reasonable to assume it would have been called off already. That Whistling Straits in Wisconsin is the host, in a country where President Trump is breathlessly pushing golf\u2019s return from cold storage, means the biennial event has not dropped from the schedule. Golf appears sport\u2019s chosen one as Trump looks to lead a charge towards normality in the United States. The NBA and MLB are looking on with intrigue.\nRory McIlroy is the most high-profile golfer to speak out against the concept of a Ryder Cup without spectators, even though one wonders if they might fancy a break from the course-side comedians now and again.\nThe players need not fret; there is little or no chance of the joust between the USA and Europe taking place in that form. In public, the competition organisers might have to at least give the impression that all avenues are being explored but there is acknowledgment within the PGA of America and European Tour that a Ryder Cup minus a 1st tee cauldron or jubilant players celebrating with fans isn\u2019t at all valid. Crucially NBC, the host broadcaster in the US, is understood to have no interest in a closed-doors scene either. Sky Sports is similarly cool.\nWhilst the PGA of America is pressing ahead with its US PGA Championship at Harding Park in early August - most likely with no spectators - there is widespread acknowledgement the Ryder Cup is different, even to a major. And rightly so.\nAs the PGA Tour pieces together mass-testing plans aimed at its return to competition in mid-June, there is an understanding that doesn\u2019t have much relevance in terms of the Ryder Cup \u2013 where the golf setting is unique. The PGA Tour labours under the incredible assumption it can play before full crowds by September, even if Trump\u2019s firm backing is useful.\nThe PGA Tour is wholly significant, however, in context of the Ryder Cup\u2019s possibly enforced contingency. By July \u2013 at the very latest \u2013 we should have a cast-iron decision on whether Whistling Straits can go ahead, even somehow at reduced capacity.\nIf it can\u2019t \u2013 which would presently be the most likely outcome \u2013 the overwhelming desire would be to nudge the Ryder Cup back to 2021. Therein comes trouble \u2013 the Presidents Cup and Olympics are already set for next year. Golfers, especially the top ones, don\u2019t care for scheduling clutter.\nCommon perception would be that the Presidents Cup, played to very little external fanfare between the US and an international team, would shuffle along elsewhere. That process would not be so simple. The Presidents Cup is a PGA Tour entity whereas the biggest corporate entity in golf has no stake at all in the Ryder Cup. It is even pertinent that the Presidents Cup takes place at Quail Hollow, therefore in the US, next time around.\nIf the PGA Tour is to amend that situation, it will surely take a lot of convincing, including from its equivalent in Europe, typically depicted as the poor relation of golf circuits. Post coronavirus, given harsh commercial realities, every tour will scrap furiously for its lot. Should the PGA and European Tours come together in a new normal \u2013 including to swat away the lingering threat of the Premier Golf League \u2013 this will be an early test.\nThere is plenty of sense in a Ryder Cup shift back towards uneven years, where it would remain. It was in that pattern before 9/11 meant 2001 at the Belfry was postponed until 2002. With 2021 the exception, a shift would handily move the Ryder Cup away from Olympic years. The full impact of Covid-19 on the Italian economy and sporting landscape is for now unclear but allowing the 2022 Ryder Cup at Marco Simone, near Rome, an extra 12 months is likely to be no bad thing.\n\u201cHaving a Ryder Cup without fans is not a Ryder Cup,\u201d said McIlroy. He is, of course, correct. If this marquee competition, which draws an audience from way beyond golf, is to help raise morale of people negatively affected by the pandemic it must do so in standard form. And, be that this September or next, it will.",

It is like a third world country. The public social safety net is not working.\u201d\nStiglitz, a long-term critic of Trump, said 14% of the population was dependent on food stamps and predicted the social infrastructure could not cope with an unemployment rate that could hit 30% in the coming months.\n\u201cWe have a safety net that is inadequate. The inequality in the US is so large. This disease has targeted those with the poorest health. In the advanced world, the US is one of the countries with the poorest health overall and the greatest health inequality.\u201d\nStiglitz said Republicans had opposed proposals to give those affected by coronavirus 10 days\u2019 sick leave, meaning many employees were going to work even while infected. \u201cThe Republicans said no because they said it would set a bad precedent. It is literally unbelievable.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe safety net is not adequate and is propagating the disease. There is very weak unemployment insurance and people don\u2019t think they can rely on it.\u201d\nDuring an interview with the Guardian to mark the paperback publication of his book People, Power, and Profits, Stiglitz was asked whether the US might be heading for a second Great Depression.\n\u201cYes is the answer in short,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave it to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell [the Republican Senate majority leader] we will have a Great Depression. If we had the right policy structure in place we could avoid it easily.\u201d\nStiglitz said that as a result of Trump\u2019s mismanagement, the White House office responsible for pandemics had been closed, funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cut, and the US had gone into the crisis without enough testing kits, masks and protective gear. Encouraged by Trump, some parts of the US were determined to reopen in a way that would facilitate the transmission of the disease and lead to a fresh outbreak, he added.\n\u201cIn those circumstances it won\u2019t be the government enforcing the lockdown, it will be fear. The concern is that people are not going to be spending on anything other than food and that\u2019s the definition of a Great Depression.\n\u201cWe were unprepared but, even given the degree of unpreparedness, Trump\u2019s decision to make this about politics rather than about science has meant we have responded far more poorly.\u201d\nStiglitz said that if Trump were defeated in the presidential contest in November and the Democrats took control of both houses of Congress there was a chance of the US moving in a more progressive direction, but he warned Republicans would fight dirty in order to cling on to power.\n\u201cThere is voter suppression and gerrymandering. The Republican party knows it\u2019s a minority party and there is a no-holds-barred struggle going on to make sure a minority party rules America.\u201d\nStiglitz said the current crisis would force countries to make themselves less vulnerable, and this would lead to shorter supply chains and a greater emphasis on self-sufficiency in food and energy.\nHe added that the complexity of modern production methods meant autarky was not feasible but added: \u201cFighting global pandemics and climate change require global cooperation. It\u2019s just that the president of the United States doesn\u2019t understand that.\n\u201cI hope we emerge from this with the perspective that multilateralism is even more important than we thought. It can\u2019t just be a corporate-driven globalisation. We have to make it more resilient.\u2019",

As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, speaking in the Commons, announced that 69 people working within the NHS had died from the coronavirus. There are growing fears about the shortages of personal protective equipment within the healthcare system.\nRaab confirmed, in response to questions from the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that the government needed to \u201cstrive even harder in this incredibly difficult and competitive international environment\u201d to source protective equipment.\nAs the Guardian has previously revealed, UK health officials attended meetings on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March, where joint procurement rounds for protective gear, ventilators and medical supplies were discussed.\nOn Tuesday, the health secretary was forced to deny claims, since retracted, by the UK\u2019s most senior diplomat, Sir Simon McDonald, that ministers had made a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d in not getting involved.\nSpeaking at Downing Street\u2019s daily press briefing on Tuesday evening, Hancock said: \u201cI have spoken to the foreign secretary. As far as I\u2019m aware there was no political decision not to participate.\n\u201cWe did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.\u201d\nA spokesman for the European commission rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU\u2019s efforts to buy masks, gowns, ventilators or laboratory supplies. \u201cThey are most welcome to participate in future rounds,\u201d the spokesman said.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave.

        "content": "Lack of coherent strategy for coronavirus fuels fears of devastating death toll\n\u201cI am really angry about this,\u201d said Dr Anna Down, scanning her computer for figures to show how coronavirus has ravaged her patients living in nursing homes.\n\u201cOne home had 23 deaths, another lost 19, and another 13,\u201d the Ealing GP said. \u201cIn two units 50% of residents died in the space of 10 days.\u201d\nDown is the clinical lead at a practice with 1,000 residents on its books in 15 privately run nursing homes in the area of west London hit harder than anywhere in Britain by Covid-19 deaths in the first weeks of the outbreak. In a normal month, she might expect to lose around 28 people. In the last month she has lost 125.\nDown has a warning to the rest of the country informed by her practice\u2019s experience: reform how social care handles Covid-19 or face rising deaths and a second devastating wave of infection.\nHer anger goes beyond grief. Her early warnings to public health authorities about the risks to care residents were not acted on, she said; infected patients continue to be discharged into care homes from hospitals, spreading the virus; and staff shortages are blighting attempts to keep the virus isolated.\nHigh-protection FFP3 face masks requested so staff could treat residents with \u201caerosol-producing\u201d lung problems and tracheostomies never came. Carers were left to spread the disease and fell ill.\n\u201cFrom the moment this started we highlighted where the problems were going to be and said we can get on top of this now,\u201d Down said. \u201cYet no definitive and timely action was taken across the health and social care system.\u201d\nThe last few weeks have been devastating on the frontline. The manager of the Ealing home where 23 people died in just two weeks described conditions as \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\u201cI have never written so many death notifications in such a short time,\u201d she said, on condition of anonymity. \u201cEvery member of staff is lost. They don\u2019t know what to do. In one of our units with 21 residents we lost nine people in three days. It\u2019s OK when you hear the numbers on TV. They are removed from reality. One day a resident was walking around with a mild temperature. I went home and the next morning they were dead.\u201d\nThe manager repeated a refrain heard in care homes everywhere at the moment: \u201cThere is so much focus on the NHS but there is little done for care homes.\n\u201cThe staffing situation is getting critical. I have seven nurses and 12 care assistants off. The care home sector needs help: staff, protection and volunteers. This has been going on since the beginning of April and I still think we are heading for the worst.\u201d\nMinisters admit official figures understate the scale of problems in care and nursing homes. Niall Dickson, the head of the NHS Confederation, described care this week as \u201cthe second front\u201d. It may yet become the main battleground.\nOfficial figures on Tuesday put the impact on Covid-19 on care homes at just over 1,000 fatalities to 10 April. But HC One, the biggest private provider, has alone lost almost 500 people to confirmed or suspected Covid-19 and the virus is active in 120 of its 328 homes. Given there are more than 15,000 care homes in England and Wales, Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of sector association Care England, predicts care home deaths will outstrip hospital fatalities (17,337 in England and Wales by Tuesday).\nYet demands for social care to be urgently reconfigured with NHS-style \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d resourcing are yet to be met.\nDown has ideas, if anyone will listen. Given isolating Covid-19 sufferers within homes frequently fails, there need to be \u201chot homes\u201d for accepting Covid-positive discharged from hospitals and \u201ccold homes\u201d for those without the virus. She describes them as \u201cthe equivalent of the Nightingale hospitals for nursing homes\u201d.\nDown believes homes are inadequately staffed to deal with the volume and intensity of demand and need nursing support from local hospitals. Staff need to be tested \u201cearly and often\u201d, and there needs to be central management of discharged hospital patients so they are put in the safest, rather than most available vacancy.\n\u201cIn terms of deaths, I don\u2019t think we have peaked yet,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time people die, more people are discharged into the homes from hospital. Without a new strategy it\u2019s not going to stop.\u201d\nThe North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups declined to comment. The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first.

We had little information about the right protocol on PPE, there were never clear guidelines on isolating, sending people to hospital, whether to wear masks.\u201d\nHer home still faces a PPE shortage and cannot afford the prices of kit on the open market. Ministers may have promised \u00a33.2bn to councils to help the Covid-19 response, but requests for financial aid to the local authorities to buy scarce essentials such as hand gel \u2013 \u201clike gold dust\u201d \u2013 has yielded nothing yet. Testing has been slow too. Swabs were sent from two residents, but results never came back. One of them died.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are ramping up testing to ensure all symptomatic staff and residents are tested, as well as testing all patients before they are discharged back to their care home - in addition to recently-updated hospital discharge guidance.\n\u201cSo far we have delivered nearly 1 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England and are working closely with the ONS, PHE and the CQC to better understand the worrying number of deaths from Covid-19 in care homes and how we can prevent them.\u201d",

He told the Commons that care home staff were scared and having to make their own masks.\nThe two men were in the chamber in person while many MPs asked Raab questions via video link.\nEarlier in the day the care minister Helen Whateley said 15 care workers and 61 NHS workers had died from coronavirus, prompting questions over the accuracy of figures being used by ministers. The true number of deaths is estimated to be far higher than official figures.\nOn testing Starmer said that with just eight days to go until the promised 100,000 tests a day was due to be achieved, only 18,000 were completed in the last 24 hours.\nRaab said: \u201cI have to correct him. Our capacity is now 40,000 per day so I think that is an incredibly important milestone. And of course he\u2019s right to say that in the final week that will require a big increase.\n\u201cI can reassure him that we are working with a range of commercial partners to boost the testing to get to that 100,000 a day.\u201d\nHe said two \u201csuper-labs\u201d in Milton Keynes and Alderley Park in Cheshire were fully functional and another in Glasgow would open later this week.\nHowever, Starmer hit back, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t need correcting because I gave the figure for the actual tests a day. The first secretary says there\u2019s capacity for 40,000 a day.\n\u201cThat means that the day before yesterday 40,000 tests could have been carried out but only 18,000 tests were actually carried out.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the government using all the tests available, every day?\u201d\nRaab said the government was making good progress and wanted to encourage people to come forward to take tests, and that it understood the transport challenges people had experienced to get to sites.",

Just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session - a \u201chybrid\u201d system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before.\nFirst, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it worked without a hitch.\nMore importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much under-rated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over.\nUnder the old PMQs MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a \u201cwinner\u201d at PMQs. (Journalists like me wrote it up like in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone \u201cwinning\u201d old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today\u2019s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today.\nKeir Starmer:\nI\u2019m disappointed we don\u2019t have a number for social care workers [who have died] and I put the first secretary on notice that I\u2019ll ask the same question again next week and hopefully we can have a better answer.\nDominic Raab:\nPeople said that we couldn\u2019t build a hospital in this country at that kind of speed, and we\u2019ve built several, with more to come.",

They will not have the same rights and access to the inquiry as other core participants such as the police and government.\n\u201cThey will not be able to play a core participant role in the inquiry and they believe that the investigation to learn lessons will be limited as a result.\u201d",

I\u2019m worried. It shouldn\u2019t have to be into this when I\u2019ve spent tens of thousands of pounds on insurance. It\u2019s like someone came into my bar and bought a drink and then I don\u2019t give it to them.\u201d\nThe group, which is being advised by the licensing industry barrister Philip Kolvin QC, is calling on more businesses to join its move against the insurer.\nOn Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures.\nIt said its core small commercial package policies did not provide cover for business interruption as a result of the \u201cgeneral measures\u201d taken by the government in response to the pandemic.\nIt said in a statement: \u201cA number of UK policyholders have disputed the application of their policy in relation to business interruption. Hiscox recognises these are extremely difficult times for businesses and is determined to help provide greater certainty for customers. As a priority it will therefore work with the UK insurance industry, its regulators and its customers to seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available.\u201d\nThe NTIA action comes as two separate Hiscox action groups, together involving about 200 more claimants, also consider legal action. The chef Raymond Blanc has also reportedly signed up lawyers after being denied a payout by Hiscox.\nOne action group backed by the insurance brokers advisory firm CEC, representing more than 30 businesses including gyms, restaurants and golf professionals, said at least some of Hiscox\u2019s policies clearly state it would pay up where the interruption to the business was \u201cdue to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease\u201d.\nRoger Topping, of the action group, said some of the policies stated payouts would reflect how the business would have traded if the restrictions had not been imposed.\nBusiness interruption policies typically pay up to \u00a3100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.\nSimon Ager, who runs the Pinnacle climbing centre in Northampton, started an action group that now has more than 100 members after being told his policy with Hiscox, including cover for losses up to \u00a3100,000, would not pay out on coronavirus pandemic claims.\nOn Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures.\nHiscox added it was \u201cactively settling claims\u201d for event cancellation and abandonment, media and entertainment and other industries including travel. It expects to pay out $150m (\u00a3120m) to settle claims if restrictions on travel and mass gatherings continue for six months.",

As well the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the first secretary, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, more junior cabinet members such as the business secretary, Alok Sharma, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, have also fronted the briefing.\n\u201cThe home secretary has already made an appearance at the daily press conference and there has also been appearances from senior medical professionals such as Dr Jenny Harries,\u201d said Truss, defending the gender imbalance.\n\u201cWomen are playing a key role in the response \u2013 [work and pensions secretary] Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey ... she\u2019s done a number of media appearances and I think she\u2019s doing an absolutely brilliant job in dealing with the number of universal credit claims.\u201d\nGiving evidence to the virtual women and equalities committee on Wednesday, Truss was asked by the chairwoman, Caroline Nokes, if she would be appearing at any of the media briefings.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like tokenism,\u201d said Truss. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that someone should just appear at a press conference or in a media interview because they are a woman. They should be doing that, and the work internally, because of the merits of what they are capable of.\u201d\nNokes responded: \u201cSo they shouldn\u2019t be there just because they are a women, but you have a remit for elderly people, for the disabled, for those from a BAME background, for the LGBTQ community \u2013 a massive group of people who will be impacted by Covid-19 \u2013 and you think it would be tokenism to appear at one of those press conferences.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that at all,\u201d said Truss. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is the excessive focus on what gender somebody is rather than what they do does a disservice to women \u2026 I believe that women are equally as capable as men, that we need more women in politics \u2026 but I think we should be focusing on the right people to present at the press conference.\n\u201cThe major issue at the moment is health so I think it\u2019s right that the health secretary is doing a lot of the press conferences. I think excessive focus on who is appearing at a press conference is the wrong focus.\u201d\nAsked about the evidence that more men were dying from coronavirus than women, and that BAME people were also disproportionately affected, Truss said: \u201cAcross the board we are trying to find out more about Covid-19, but it\u2019s a relatively new disease and a lot more needs to be done \u2026 We\u2019re looking at getting data in a useable format at the moment.\u201d",

        "content": "Manchester, Liverpool and London in talks to secure emergency government funding\nThe government could bail out rail and tram networks in cities such as London and Manchester as soon as this week, as public transport revenues almost entirely disappear during the coronavirus lockdown.\nTransport has been among the hardest-hit industries during the pandemic, with all but essential journeys banned and people across the UK urged to work from home where possible.\nAn announcement from the government could come \u201cwithin days\u201d, according to UK Tram, the lobby group representing Britain and Ireland\u2019s 11 light railway systems. However, James Hammett, UK Tram\u2019s managing director, added that there had been difficulties securing a deal because of the \u201cdiffering contractual obligations under which networks operate\u201d.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) last month suspended rail franchising, in effect renationalising the rail industry to prevent its complete collapse during the crisis. It has also bailed out bus companies with \u00a3167m of funding over the next three months.\nHowever, transport operated by local bodies \u2013 such as the London Underground, Manchester\u2019s Metrolink and Liverpool\u2019s Merseyrail \u2013 was not included in the previous bailouts. The bailout talks were first reported by the Financial Times.\nLondon\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told BBC Radio London on Tuesday the government was talking to Transport for London (TfL) and other public travel providers around the country about grant support. If it does not receive support TfL would have to consider cutting services and jobs, he said.\n\u201cWe have cash reserves which we\u2019re eating into,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly speaking, because we\u2019ve lost 95% of passengers on the tube, because we\u2019ve lost 85% of passengers on buses, we\u2019re struggling.\u201d\nA TfL spokesman said Khan was referring to TfL\u2019s prudent \u201cminimum cash balances\u201d by the end of the month, which by then would still be \u00a31.2bn. That would be sufficient for TfL to keep operating core transport and paying staff while talks continued.\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said the whole of the Metrolink system could be suspended if there was no money forthcoming, according to the Liverpool Echo on Tuesday. In Liverpool, demand for Merseyrail has fallen by 83% during the crisis.\nIn Manchester, Metrolink patronage is down by 95%, meaning the network will lose about \u00a35.3m a month, even after the cost savings. On 13 April Metrolink made just \u00a38,900, compared with \u00a3480,000 on 2 March before lockdown restrictions were imposed.\nTfL has reported that daily revenues are down by 90%. At the same time, it has temporarily suspended the congestion charge and emissions charges, putting further pressure on the body\u2019s finances, a spokesman said.\nAdvertising revenues have fallen to a \u201cnegligible amount\u201d, the spokesman said, while the body has given 100% rent relief to tenants in its properties for three months.\nThe government is understood to be in regular contact with operators about their financial difficulties.\nA DfT spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are aware of the challenges faced by transport operators, and continue to work closely with the sector and transport authorities to ensure passengers can make essential journeys.\u201d",

Eastern Europe is expected to be one of the worst-hit regions as migrant workers in western Europe and Russia are forced to cut back the amounts they send back to families in Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries.\nThe World Bank said studies showed that remittances alleviated poverty in lower- and middle-income countries, improved nutrition, were linked to higher spending on education, and reduced child labour in disadvantaged households.\n\u201cA fall in remittances affect families\u2019 ability to spend on these areas as more of their finances will be directed to solve food shortages and immediate livelihoods needs,\u201d it said.\nCountries that are large recipients of remittances, such as India, have also imposed lockdowns, causing widespread unemployment and hardship, often making the situation even worse for families that suffer a decline in money being sent home.\nOil-dependent countries, which have seen crude prices tumble from more than $60 a barrel in January to less than $20 a barrel this week, have also been hit by the economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the amount of help they can offer poor families.\nDilip Ratha, chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank, said migrants often worked in insecure jobs and were among the first to be let go in a crisis.\n\u201cBut it is not just that they lose their jobs, the stores they use to send cash home have also shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cMigrants typically send small amounts of cash via stores and these have closed.\u201d\nRatha said the developed world has come to depend on migrant workers for cheap and skilled labour, and should do more to alleviate their situation. They need access to healthcare for themselves and their families and cut-price banking facilities, which would allow them to send money home without paying high fees and commissions.\nLast year, remittances reached an all-time high of $554bn. Next year, the World Bank expects a 5.6% recovery from the $445bn predicted this year to $470bn.\nIt said: \u201cThe outlook for remittance remains as uncertain as the impact of Covid-19 on the outlook for global growth and on the measures to restrain the spread of the disease.\n\u201cIn the past, remittances have been countercyclical, where workers send more money home in times of crisis and hardship back home. This time, however, the pandemic has affected all countries, creating additional uncertainties,\u201d it added.\nRemittance flows are expected to fall across all regions, most notably in Europe and central Asia, where the fall in income is expected to be 27.5%, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, with a 23.1% decline. For east Asia and the Pacific, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines, the fall is put at 13% .",

However, there is humour, especially when one man remembers realising that the room in which he was expected to produce the sample was the same one in which he had the initial consultation.

A further \u20ac9.47bn is being sought by other airlines, data tracking by Transport & Environment, Greenpeace and Carbon Watch reveals.\nBy the time air travel came to a near halt in March, greenhouse gas emissions from the sector had reached record levels. But there are no binding environmental conditions being attached to any of the already agreed bailouts or future loans being sought.\nThe exception is in Austria, where the transport minister, Leonore Gewessler, responded to a request for public support by Austrian Airlines (part of the Lufthansa group) by saying any bailout should be linked to climate targets.\nThe amounts being negotiated for bailout plans and recapitalisation are likely to increase as talks continue with some of the biggest European airlines, including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and Alitalia.\nThe Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:\n\u2022 Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.\n\u2022 Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.\n\u2022 Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u00a0 \n\u2022 Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.\n\u2022 A fifth of all farmland \u2013 15% of the UK \u2013 being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes.\n\u2022 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.\n\u2022 Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. \nIn the UK, Virgin\u2019s Richard Branson has come under fire for seeking a \u00a3565m bailout from the government. He has been told to explore other ways of getting cash before seeking state aid but environmental conditions have not been at the forefront of government comments on the bailout plea.\nEasyJet, which has secured a \u00a3600m emergency loan from the UK government, emitted 4.1% more CO2 in 2019 than in 2018.\nAndrew Murphy, the aviation manager for Transport & Environment, said: \u201cAirlines are seeking public money so they can get back to the business-as-usual of soaring emissions enabled by light-touch pollution laws and tax exemptions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to ensure that aviation makes a green transition by linking aid to taxes and greener fuels which will reverse the sector\u2019s rapid emissions growth.\u201d\nAviation is one of the fastest growing contributors to greenhouse gas emissions over the past 20 years. In the last five years there has been a 26% rise in GHG emissions from aviation.\nLast year, Ryanair joined coal plants as one of Europe\u2019s top 10 polluters after increasing its emissions on flights within the continent by 5.9%.\nA global scheme run by the UN to offset aviation emissions that grow above 2020 levels, known as Corsia, began this year, but airlines are seeking delays and changes to it as a result of the coronavirus crisis.\nThe analysis published on Wednesday reveals that five of the airlines seeking or receiving state aid as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic have earned more than \u20ac1bn in net profits in the past five years. These include IAG, which owns British Airways (\u20ac9.37bn profit), Lufthansa group (\u20ac8.17bn), Tui group (\u20ac3.09bn), easyJet (\u20ac2.39bn) and Air France-KLM (\u20ac1.05bn). Airlines do not pay fuel taxes or VAT on flights.\nFaiza Oulahsen, from Greenpeace EU, said: \u201cPublic bailouts must come with strict conditions to protect jobs and slash the aviation sector\u2019s soaring contribution to climate breakdown.\n\u201cAny public funding should lay the foundation for a just and green transition for people and planet, with widespread investment in transport alternatives like trains. Governments must address both the economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis and the crisis we face in climate change.\u201d",

He was last seen on 26 February after posting a video in which he was chased by a white SUV and an hours-long live-stream that ended when several agents entered his apartment.\nIn a video posted on YouTube, Weibo and Twitter Li said on 26 February the white SUV had pulled out in front of him while he was driving in the Wuchang district in Wuhan and the people in it yelled for him to stop. Li panicked and drove off with the car in pursuit, recording the video that he posted online later that day.\n\u6211\u662f\u674e\u6cfd\u534eKcriss\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f2\u670826\u65e5\u81f3\u4eca\u5173\u4e8e\u6211\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002I'm Kcriss,  here is something about me si... https://t.co/ETjY7QaacY via @YouTube\nAfter making it back to his apartment, he saw uniformed police and staff in protective suits knocking on the doors of his neighbours. Li turned the lights off and sat quietly in front of his computer for hours, waiting. Three hours later, a knock came.\nAt least three men entered his apartment, identifying themselves as public security. Li then went with them to a local police station where he was told he was being investigated on charges of disrupting public order.\nPolice later said they would not charge him but because he had visited \u201csensitive epidemic areas\u201d he would need to undergo quarantine.\nLi, who had to give his devices over to a friend, spent the next month in quarantine in Wuhan and then in his hometown in a different province. He was served three meals a day, monitored by security guards and able to watch state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s evening newscast.\n\u201cThroughout the whole time, the police acted civilly and legally, making sure I had rest and food. They really cared about me,\u201d he said. Li said he was released on 28 March and has been spending time with his family. He wished those who suffered during the epidemic a fast recovery. \u201cMay God bless China and the people of the world unite.\u201d\nLi\u2019s tone and comments, neutral and patriotic, were markedly different from his previous videos. Li, who had worked for the state-broadcaster CCTV, travelled to Wuhan to report on the crisis after another citizen journalist and activist Chen Qiushi disappeared.\nIn his videos, he reported on a local neighbourhood committee\u2019s efforts to cover up new infections and interviewed sick residents. He visited a crematorium where a worker said people were being paid more to transport bodies.\nAt the time Li said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up.\u201d\nYet, in closing his video on Wednesday, Li quoted a line from a Confucian text about staying true to one\u2019s beliefs. \u201cThe human heart is unpredictable, restless. Its affinity to what is right is small. Be discriminating, be uniform so that you may hold fast,\u201d he said.\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang",

Clinical trials of nicotine patches are awaiting the approval of the country\u2019s health authorities.\nHowever, the researchers insisted they were not encouraging the population to take up smoking, which carries other potentially fatal health risks and kills 50% of those who take it up. While nicotine may protect those from the virus, smokers who have caught it often develop more serious symptoms because of the toxic effect of tobacco smoke on the lungs, they say.\nThe team at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the virus, 350 of whom were hospitalised while the rest with less serious symptoms were allowed home.\nIt found that of those admitted to hospital, whose median age was 65, only 4.4% were regular smokers. Among those released home, with a median age of 44, 5.3% smoked.\nTaking into account the age and sex of the patients, the researchers discovered the number of smokers was much lower than that in the general population estimated by the French health authority Sant\u00e9 Publique France at about 40% for those aged 44-53 and between 8.8% and 11.3% for those aged 65-75.\nThe renowned French neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux, who reviewed the study, suggested the nicotine might stop the virus from reaching cells in the body preventing its spread. Nicotine may also lessen the overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system that has been found in the most severe cases of Covid-19 infection.\nThe findings are to be verified in a clinical study in which frontline health workers, hospital patients with the Covid-19 virus and those in intensive care will be given nicotine patches.\nThe results confirm a Chinese study published at the end of March in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested only 12.6% of 1,000 people infected with the virus were smokers while the number of smokers in China is around 28%.\nIn France, figures from Paris hospitals showed that of 11,000 patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19, 8.5% were smokers. The total number of smokers in France is estimated at around 25.4%.\n\u201cOur cross-sectional study strongly suggests that those who smoke every day are much less likely to develop a symptomatic or severe infection with Sars-CoV-2 compared with the general population,\u201d the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re report authors wrote.\n\u201cThe effect is significant. It divides the risk by five for ambulatory patients and by four for those admitted to hospital. We rarely see this in medicine,\u201d it added.",

Witnesses said an officer had deliberately opened the door, which the police denied.

But unlike most of those seeking refuge, they had once been part of the state\u2019s machinery of oppression.\nWhen the conflict began, both men were members of the notoriously vicious intelligence service, which arrested, tortured and killed protesters and opposition figures. But both defected from the regime, and they seemed to have thought that would protect them from their past.\nOn Thursday Raslan and Gharib will appear at a regional court in the south-western German town of Koblenz, the first trial for war crimes relating to state torture in Syria since the start of the conflict nine years ago.\nRaslan, 57, is charged with crimes against humanity, rape, aggravated sexual assault and 58 murders at Branch 251, an intelligence unit with its own prison in Damascus, where he allegedly oversaw the torture of at least 4,000 people as a commanding officer between 29 April 2011 and 7 September 2012.\nThe indictment lists prisoners being hung from their wrists, electrocuted, beaten until unconscious and subjected to a method called dulab, or wheel, where victims were forced into a vehicle tyre and then hoisted up and beaten.\nEyad al-Gharib, 42, a more lowly official allegedly tasked with rounding up protesters, is accused of assistance to torture and murder in 30 counts.\nSix Syrians who were tortured at Branch 251 have been given the right to appear at the court as co-plaintiffs, though travel restrictions introduced since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe mean only three are expected to be present when the trial begins.\nThe Koblenz trial taking place because in 2002 Germany enacted the legal principle of universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity, allowing the prosecution of serious crimes in its courts even if they happened elsewhere.\nA special war crimes unit at Germany\u2019s federal criminal police was set up in 2003, initially investigating suspected genocides in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Yugoslav wars.\nAs thousands of Syrian refugees applied for asylum in Germany between 2015 and 2017, the unit received more than 2,800 tipoffs about crimes allegedly committed under the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\nIn the case of Raslan and Gharib, the initial tipoffs came at least partially from the men themselves. It appears that, when interviewed by German officials, they made little attempt to hide their part in the violent suppression of political dissent.\nRaslan is understood to have deserted from the regime in 2012, after forces loyal to Assad carried out a massacre in his home town. He sought asylum in Germany in 2014.\nLiving at a refugee shelter in Marienfelde, Berlin, Raslan did not change his name, and he was eventually recognised by other Syrians, including opposition supporters and a prominent human rights lawyer.\nRaslan appeared to have no fear of German authorities. According to reports in German newspapers, independently confirmed by the Guardian, Raslan entered a Berlin police station in February 2015 to request protection from Syrian and Russian intelligence operatives he believed had followed him to a recent doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\u201cHe appeared to think there was nothing to it,\u201d Christian Ritscher, an investigator for the German public prosecutor general in Karlsruhe, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\nRaslan, who was probably already on the radar of the German war crimes investigators when he sought official protection, was arrested in February 2019.\nGharib too gave German investigators more information than they had expected. When interviewed for his asylum application in Germany in the summer of 2018, he freely said that in Damascus he had helped round up protesters and people taking pictures of the protests on their phones, who were transported to Branch 251.\nHe claimed to have deserted in January 2012 because he had been asked to kill civilians, and because three of his colleagues had died in skirmishes near Damascus.\nHis knowledge of the secret police\u2019s procedures led to him being taken in for further questioning, initially as a witness. But he was reclassified as a suspect after revealing extremely detailed knowledge of torture methods, including the use of kettles to burn victim\u2019s backs and the breaking of detainees\u2019 legs with iron bars to stop them taking part in future demonstrations.\nA legal complaint about the interview procedure led to Gharib briefly being released, but this was rejected by the federal high court last June. The fact he did not try to flee from German authorities in the meantime is likely to count in his favour at trial.\nWhether Raslan and Gharib will plead guilty or not guilty is unclear. The pair are being represented by separate defence lawyers, who have both declined to comment on their strategy.\nIn the courtroom, the two Syrians\u2019 role in the regime\u2019s torture apparatus will be weighed against their decisions to defect. If it comes to sentencing, \u201cthe court will also have to take into account what these men did after taking part in human rights abuses\u201d, said Patrick Kroker, a Berlin-based criminal lawyer working with some of the co-plaintiffs in the case.\nThe hope among the Syrian diaspora is that the trial, which could last two to three years, will not just test the guilt of two individuals but also lay bare the workings of a violent system that suppressed and murdered thousands of civilians.",

The students, who were taken into custody on 1 April, have also been charged with sedition, murder, possession of arms, incitement of violence, attempt to murder, and promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and rioting.\nSix others were arrested connected to the same charges in early April but were released on bail.\nAccording to the police report, officers collected firearms, petrol bombs, acid bottles and stones from the students\u2019 homes. Lawyers representing the men say they have seen no evidence or documentation.\nThe riots, which raged through the streets of north-east Delhi in late February, resulted in homes burned and destroyed, thousands of people injured, and at least 52 deaths. Hindu and Muslim groups clashed in the capital but, primarily, Muslims were the victims of violent Hindu mobs. Thousands of Muslim families were left homeless and destitute and three-quarters of those killed were Muslim.\nThe riots are widely acknowledged to have been sparked by incendiary comments made by Kapil Mishra, a leader from the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), about Muslims peacefully protesting against a controversial new citizenship law. Video evidence and witness accounts pointed to police allowing Hindu mobs to roam the streets freely to target the Muslim community.\nThe police investigation into the causes of the violence has, however, focused on the Muslim and student activist community, particularly those who had been previously known to the police for involvement in mass student protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December. Police entered the Jamia Millia University campus in December, beating activists and detaining students.\nAkram Khan, the lawyer representing Haider, a PhD student at Jamia Millia University, said: \u201cThere is no evidence to substantiate these allegations or even to connect my client to these riots at all. He was not even present. He was participating in the peaceful protests against CAA at Jamia Milia University so he was known to the police, but that\u2019s all. But we still have not even been given the full charge sheet and I have seen no evidence.\u201d\nUmar Khalid, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader, who was among those leading the anti-CAA protests in December, has also been named on the police report on the alleged conspiracy to cause riots, but has not been arrested.\nShehla Rasheed, a former JNU student union leader, tweeted: \u201cYet another bogus case! It\u2019s shameful how the government of India is exploiting the lockdown (no protest) to target progressive activists, intellectuals, journalists. Stay strong.\u201d\nThe Jamia Coordination Committee, a student and alumni group, also condemned the arrests. \u201cThe country is facing a massive health crisis. However, the state machinery is busy harassing and framing student activists in false cases to suppress voices of dissent,\u201d it said.\nThe total number of arrests made in connection with the Delhi riots remains unclear, with official figures ranging wildly from around 50 to over 3,000.\nDelhi police said in a statement: \u201cAll the arrests made have been based on analysis of scientific and forensic evidence, including video footage, technical and other footprints.\u201d",

        "content": "More than a thousand people are set to attend motor races in South Dakota this weekend with the state yet to issue a stay-at-home order for its residents during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Park Jefferson Speedway, which has a capacity of 4,000, says it has sold all 700 tickets it has allocated for a race on Saturday while the New Raceway Park had sold 310 of its 500 tickets for an event on Sunday. Both tracks are in Jefferson, and all attendees will be required to wear face coverings.\nJust a heads up that all 700 tickets are sold.  Join us on @SpeedShiftTV  if you can.\n\u201cWe intend to go overboard on following CDC guidelines,\u201d Park Jefferson Speedway owner Adam Adamson told the Argus Leader. \u201cWe\u2019re just a small race track in rural South Dakota trying to give some entertainment and a little bit of a break from some of this madness that\u2019s going on right now. We think we can do so in a safe environment.\u201d\nSouth Dakota\u2019s Republican governor, Kristi Noem, has faced criticism for refusing to issue a stay at home order, although she has rolled out an executive order telling residents to practice social distancing.\nNoem was asked about the racing events at a press conference on Tuesday and said she did not agree with the decision to stage them. Both meetings are perfectly legal while there is no stay-at-home order.\n\u201cI can encourage people not to go. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for them to attend,\u201d Noem said. \u201cI still recommend that we follow the plans that I have laid out for South Dakota where we don\u2019t gather in sizes of over 10 and that folks continue to social distance if they\u2019re not feeling well to stay home and to wash their hands.\u201d\nThere have been 1,755 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Dakota and eight deaths. It ranks 46th in population out of the US\u2019s 50 states.\nPumped....making the 5 1/2 hour drive from Burlington, IA, can\u2019t wait!!! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nOne user on Twitter said they intended to drive five-and-a-half hours from Iowa, which has had far more cases and deaths than South Dakota, to attend the event.\nSouth Dakota\u2019s economy relies on tourism and agriculture, which have both been hit hard by the pandemic. Noem, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, has said she does not want to sacrifice individual liberties by putting the state under lockdown.\n\u201cI took an oath when I was in Congress, obviously, to uphold the constitution of the United States,\u201d she told Fox News. \u201cI believe in our freedoms and liberties. What I\u2019ve seen across the country is so many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security, and they don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d",

Older teenagers will be allowed out alone to buy food or medicine.\nSpain has recorded 21,717 deaths in the pandemic, the third highest number in the world after the US and Italy, and has already twice extended its state of emergency, originally declared on 14 March.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through a time of extraordinary sacrifices,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said as he asked MPs for a new extension until 9 May. \u201cWe can\u2019t let our guard down. We can start to think about a de-escalation scenario. But we must be prudent.\u201d\nIn a further sign that the country is turning a corner, an emergency morgue set up at an ice rink in Madrid to help the city store its dead closed its doors on Wednesday. Over the course of almost a month it took in 1,146 bodies.\nThe UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights, Philip Alston, has said government responses to the pandemic are failing people in poverty.\n\u201cThe policies of many states reflect a social Darwinism philosophy that prioritises the economic interests of the wealthiest while doing little for those who are hard at work providing essential services or unable to support themselves,\u201d Alston said. \u201cThis is a crisis that disproportionately affects poor people.\u201d\nAs some Europeans \u2013 from Danes to Austrians and German to Norwegians \u2013 took their first tentative steps out of confinement, EU leaders were expected to endorse urgent spending measures and debate a massive recovery plan at a virtual summit on Thursday.\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, about one million people in the EU have tested positive for coronavirus and more than 110,000 of them have died \u2013 more than half of the global death toll.\nThe pandemic has put new strains on the unity of the 27-member bloc, exposing splits between the richer north and the poorer south. But S\u00e1nchez said he expected consensus at the summit \u201cbecause it is indispensable\u201d.\nSpain has proposed creating a fund of up to \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) financed by perpetual debt, but the EU\u2019s fiscally conservative northern nations, led by the Netherlands, Germany and Austria, remain keen to keep a tight rein on spending and have rejected calls from the south for joint debt \u2013 nicknamed coronabonds \u2013 to fund recovery.\n\u201cThis pandemic touches all of us in every member state and in every household,\u201d the president of the European council, Charles Michel, said in his invitation to the summit. \u201cIt knows no boundaries and calls for even more coordination and unity. It is my conviction that we must show even greater determination in overcoming our differences.\u201d\nEU institutions and nations have already mobilised about \u20ac3.3tn combined, and leaders are expected to endorse a package worth \u20ac540bn that would help pay lost wages, keep companies afloat and fund healthcare systems.\nBut drawing up a recovery plan that can be endorsed by the EU\u2019s diverse array of members is likely to prove more challenging. The consensus is that it should total at least \u20ac1tn and target the economic sectors and European regions hit hardest by the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, Germany has authorised its first clinical test of a vaccine on human volunteers. The vaccine has been developed by the German firm BioNTech and the US giant Pfizer.\nIn further developments:\nIran reported 94 new deaths from coronavirus, the highest number in more than a week, and 1,194 new confirmed cases.\nThe number of infections in Poland passed 10,000, and the death toll reached 404.\nRussia recorded 5,236 new cases and 57 deaths, bringing its totals to 57,999 and 513.\nSingapore\u2019s health ministry said it had confirmed another 1,016 cases, mostly among migrant workers living in dormitories, who account for more than three-quarters of the city-state\u2019s infections.\nTaiwanese authorities were trying to track down thousands of people who may have come into contact with more than 700 sailors allowed to disembark after a \u201cgoodwill\u201d mission to the Pacific Islands.",

But only a week later, something else has cropped up, and he wasn\u2019t very happy at all when we shouted at him earlier to get up and do some effing work.\nTo be fair, the main reason for his discontent had little to do with the request itself, and more because our sudden yelling caused him to wake with a start, fall backwards off his chair, his legs tilting upwards, the weave of his loafers snagging in the cord of the ceiling fan above his desk, turning it on to full power and spinning him around the office at great velocity. The centrifugal force caused him to black out at regular intervals, which at least momentarily stopped the screaming. An unfortunate business, all told, especially as The Fiver now faces a workplace tribunal and possible police charges, but at least it got us two-thirds of the way through the top story on yet another quiet news day, so every cloud and all that.\nIt does however mean that it\u2019s left to The Fiver to explain the latest development in this big Toon deal. And it\u2019s this: Qatar-based broadcaster and Richard Keys enablers beIN Sport have written to all the Premier League clubs urging them to nix it. That\u2019s because they hold the TV rights for the Middle East, and angrily claim that Saudi Arabia is allowing a pirate firm, the provocatively titled beoutQ, to illegally broadcast matches in the country. In other words, don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds. The Saudis vigorously deny the charge, leaving the Premier League to make an unenviable choice: annoy the people who put hundreds of millions into the game \u2026 or the people who are promising to put hundreds of millions into the game. Po\u2019 Premier League! It\u2019s tough when the buck stops with you, as The Fiver fears it will soon find out.

Back in the mid-90s, a few friends and I made the trip to see Wimbledon v Southampton at Selhurst Park. That evening, extremely refreshed from the day\u2019s pre- and post-match activities, we were stumbling home past an old, derelict house, which we immediately decided must be haunted and warranted further investigation. Walking through an unlocked door into a pitch-black room, myself and one other chap dropped suddenly into a gaping hole in the floor. My mate landed badly, catching his arm across a beam of wood, which required immediate medical attention (the arm, not the wood) and subsequent operation to fix a shattered elbow \u2013 pins, screws, the whole shooting match. To this day he cannot straighten that arm. Days after the event I noticed that a button on the shirt I had been wearing had broken in half and was barely attached to the garment. I was otherwise entirely unscathed. He remains understandably unhappy that he required emergency corrective surgery and subsequent physiotherapy as a result of that ill-advised excursion, while I required a trip to the haberdashery.

        "content": "Research on events in Hawaii suggests climate crisis could increase eruptions around world\nThe spectacular eruptions of the K\u012blauea volcano in Hawaii in 2018 were triggered by extreme rainfall in the preceding months, research suggests.\nScientists say the finding raises the possibility that climate breakdown, which is causing more extreme weather, could lead to an increase in eruptions around the world.\nThe 2018 K\u012blauea eruptions were one of the most extraordinary sequences in at least 200 years, according to the scientists, with rifts opening, summit explosions and collapses, and a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. But the trigger was not known.\nHowever, several months of unusually high rainfall preceded the eruption, with one 24-hour period setting a record for the entire US. This flood of water would have percolated down into fissures and pores in the rocks of the volcano, as far as 1.8 miles (2.9km) below the surface.\nThe scientists calculated this pushed up the pore pressure inside the rocks to the highest level in almost 50 years, weakening them and allowing magma to push up from below.\nThe scientists also looked at eruptions of K\u012blauea since 1790 and found that these historical events were twice as likely to happen in the rainy season. Such a link has long been thought possible \u2013 JD Dana, one of the first geologists to visit Hawaii in the late 1800s, suggested the idea.\nThey also ruled out magma pressure from below triggering the eruption, because the surface had barely deformed, and the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, which can trigger eruptions.\n\u201cAll the circumstantial evidence points in the same direction,\u201d said Jamie Farquharson, at the University of Miami, whose research is published in the journal Nature. Rain has been linked to shallow eruptions in the past, such as at Mount St Helens in 1980, but this is the first time an impact at depth has been found.\n\u201cCritically, as our climate continues to change, the occurrence of prolonged periods of extreme rainfall is predicted to increase in many parts of the world, increasing the potential for rainfall-triggered volcanic phenomena,\u201d said Farquharson, adding that research on the phenomenon was needed on other volcanoes. Other scientists have warned that the melting of ice on volcanic peaks may also cause eruptions.\nFarquharson said rainfall could now be an additional factor taken into account when assessing the risk of a volcano erupting.\nMichael Manga, at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the study, said: \u201cVolcanoes are part of a dynamic Earth system. Volcanic eruptions influence all surface environments, including climate and weather. Changes in those surface environments, such as heavy rainfall, might also influence eruptions. We are only just beginning to understand these interactions.\u201d",

Extraction is a made-for-Netflix action thriller from veterans of the Marvel Comic Universe \u2013 screenwriter Joe Russo, stunt-specialist-turned-director Sam Hargrave and star Chris Hemsworth. It\u2019s based on the graphic novel Ciudad (which Russo co-authored), transferring the action from the Paraguayan city of Ciudad Del Este to Dhaka in Bangladesh.\nExtraction is a little bit hokey and absurd, and the very end has an exasperating cop-out \u2013 but it has to be admitted that, in terms of pure action octane, Russo and Hargrave bring the noise, and there are quite a few long-distance \u201csniper\u201d scenes in which people get taken out from miles away as the bullet travels through their skulls with a resonant thoonk.\nHemsworth is the improbably named Tyler Rake, a super-tough mercenary soldier and legendary warrior, secretly sad and lonely. When the school-age son of Mumbai crime lord Ovi Mahajan (Pankaj Tripathi) is kidnapped by rival Bangladeshi mobster Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Tyler is hired for a staggering sum of money to go in to Dhaka \u2013 all guns blazing and combat knives stabbing \u2013 to get the kid back. Extract him, in fact. But when he does, Tyler realises that he is being double-crossed all over the shop and he finds that the only human being he quite likes is Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the terrified boy now under his protection.\nSo the odd quasi-father-son couple go on the run in the teeming, chaotic streets, and there is some impressive stunt work and fantastically steroidal action sequences. Golshifteh Farahani plays Tyler\u2019s handler Nik, whose job it is to make earpiece contact with him, in the now accepted Mission: Impossible style, although there isn\u2019t much here for her to do.

The woman, Patricia Dowd, was a San Jose resident, according to public death records.\nThe first official recorded death in the nation from the virus was reported on 29 February in Kirkland, in the state of Washington. Before the results from the three deaths, officials believed the first case of community-transmitted coronavirus in Santa Clara county had not occurred before 28 February.\nThe medical examiner-coroner of Santa Clara county, received confirmation on Tuesday that tissue samples obtained during autopsies and sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested positive for the virus, officials said.\nA third such death \u2013 a 70-year-old man \u2013 had occurred on 6 March. Santa Clara county is south of San Francisco and includes San Jose.\n\u201cWhat these deaths tell us is that we had community transmission, probably to a significant degree, far earlier than we had known and that indicates that the virus was probably introduced and circulating in our community far earlier than we had known,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county.\nThe first officially confirmed case of coronavirus in the US was on 21 January, in Washington state. The latest news from California indicates to officials that coronavirus was spreading in the community by early to mid-January, much earlier than thought.\nCody called the three deaths \u201ciceberg tips\u201d \u2013 indicators that spread had been much worse than what experts originally thought. She noted that since testing at the time was limited by the federal government\u2019s guidance on who should be tested, health officials were unable to act sooner.\n\u201cWhen we identified our first travel-associated cases in late January, we had a very narrow case definition,\u201d Cody said. \u201cWe were only looking among people who had traveled. We were wondering, how do we detect community transmission if we\u2019re not testing people who haven\u2019t traveled? I think this answers the question in that we didn\u2019t detect community transmission.\u201d\nNone of the three early deaths had significant travel history, Cody said. She suspects that the region\u2019s \u201crobust influenza season\u201d this year may have included some cases of coronavirus.\nThe announcement came after the California governor, Gavin Newsom, promised a \u201cdeep dive\u201d update on Wednesday of the state\u2019s ability to test for the coronavirus and to track and isolate people who have it, one of the six indicators he says is key to lifting a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order that has slowed the spread of the disease while forcing millions of people to file for unemployment benefits.\n\u201cThis will go to the obvious questions and queries that all of us are asking: When? \u2026 When do you see a little bit of a release in the valve so that we can let out a little of this pressure,\u201d Newsom said.\nNewsom said the state was testing an average of 14,500 people a day, up from just 2,000 tests a day at the beginning of April.\nStill, in a state of nearly 40 million people, that\u2019s not enough for public health officials to know for sure the reach of the highly contagious virus that is still causing outbreaks across the state in nursing homes and homeless shelters.\nNewsom said he wants the state to test at least 25,000 people a day by the end of April.\nCalifornia has more than 35,600 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,300 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\nCalifornia has been under a mandatory, statewide stay-at-home order for more than a month.\nLast week, Newsom said he will not consider loosening that order until hospitalizations, particularly those in intensive care units, flatten and start to decline for at least two weeks. On Tuesday, Newsom announced intensive care hospitalizations rose 3.8%.\nAgencies contributed reporting",

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nOn Wednesday, the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it believed the official death toll in care homes in England had doubled in just five days, rising to about 2,100 fatalities by 15 April since the epidemic began. Care home chains have said that up to 70% of their units have reported infections.\nOn Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics had said there were 1,043 deaths in care up to 10 April. Until then, the official toll was 217. It meant the official estimate of how many people were being killed by Covid-19 in care homes increased tenfold in 24 hours.\nThe social care minister, Helen Whately, said on Wednesday she was \u201creally, really worried about deaths in care homes\u201d.\n\u201cWe are seeing a levelling-off in hospitals [but] we\u2019re not seeing that in care homes,\u201d she said.\nIn a joint statement, the DHSC and the Care Quality Commission pointed to concerns that more people were dying in care from non-Covid-19 causes than would normally be the case.\nThey said: \u201cCQC\u2019s preliminary analysis also indicates there may be a significant rise in non-Covid-19 deaths. This is of particular concern and we will be exploring the factors that may be driving this with local authorities, adult social care trade associations, PHE, NHSE \u2013 to ensure timely action is taken to safeguard people.\nA social care strategy unveiled last week by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, indicated that NHS nurses could eventually be sent into homes, but it has not happened yet in England apart from a small number of nurses who have returned from retirement deployed to social care.\nIt pledged new guidance about redeploying staff between social care providers and health services to tackle staff shortages and said that nurses and student nurses were being deployed by regional health hubs \u201cirrespective of setting or organisational boundaries\u201d. It promised: \u201cNurses will be deployed to support social care.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to get nursing staff into these care environments,\u201d said Vic Rayner, the executive director of the National Care Forum. \u201c[Care homes] might normally deal with one or two people at a time needing end-of-life care, so anything on top of that will require additional support.\u201d\nDr Anna Down, a GP in Ealing, west London, who looks after residents of 15 nursing homes, more than 100 of whom have died from suspected or confirmed Covid-19 in the past month, said \u201can army of staff\u201d was needed to effectively isolate infected residents and halt virus transmission.\n\u201cI have had nurses say to me this is like running a critical care unit with only one oxygen saturation probe,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need support. It is manpower-intensive to look after sick patients.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the department of health in Northern Ireland said: \u201cTrust employed or bank staff have been working on the rotas in care homes for the last two to three weeks. This is happening in all trust areas, with significant number of trust staff in at least one care home. We expect the number of staff working in this way to grow.\u201d",

        "content": "Astronomer who established that the Earth\u2019s chemical elements were formed inside stars\nThe British-American astronomer Margaret Burbidge, who has died aged 100, was the principal author of a watershed scientific paper in 1957 that set out the evidence for chemical elements having been formed inside stars. In essence, the work of her and her collaborators proved that the iron in our blood, the oxygen in our lungs, the calcium in our bones, even the carbon in our DNA was made in the hearts of massive stars and then exploded back into space billions of years ago.\nThe 100-page paper was titled Synthesis of the Elements in Stars and was published in the journal Reviews of Modern Physics. Burbidge was the first author, together with her collaborators, her husband, Geoffrey Burbidge, William A Fowler and Fred Hoyle; the paper became known as B2FH, from the first letters of its authors\u2019 surnames.\nPrior to its publication there were two competing theories for the origin of the chemical elements. The Soviet-American physicist George Gamow thought they were formed during the birth of the universe, in the big bang. However, astrophysicists had shown that stars generated energy by fusing lighter elements into heavier ones. This led the British astronomer Hoyle to propose, in 1954, that the big bang only made the three lightest elements, hydrogen, helium and lithium, and that stars made all the rest. Over a two-year period, 1955-56, the Burbidges and Fowler then gathered a wealth of evidence in support of Hoyle\u2019s theory. These included astronomical observations taken by Margaret of the elemental abundances, and the laboratory measurements of nuclear reactions gathered by Fowler.\nThe results were conclusive. The paper changed our understanding of cosmic evolution, and of our connection to the vast universe. As Fowler put it: \u201cAll of us are truly and literally a little bit of stardust.\u201d\nBorn in Stockport, Greater Manchester, to Stanley Peachey, a chemistry lecturer and inventor, and his wife, Marjorie (nee Stott), Margaret had a fascination with the stars that began with a bout of seasickness when she was four. The family was on a night crossing of the English Channel, en route to a holiday in France. She was lifted to the porthole so that she could distract herself by looking at the stars; it was the first time she had really seen those twinkling beacons and they captured her imagination.\nFrom Francis Holland school in London, Margaret went to University College London to study astronomy, physics and mathematics. She graduated with first class honours in 1939, just as the second world war was looming, and went to work at the University of London\u2019s Mill Hill observatory, where her observing logs indicated that she sometimes had to realign the telescope because of nearby explosions from German V1 flying bombs.\nShe gained a PhD in 1943 and took such joy in the wonders of the night sky that when she saw a detailed photographic plate of a spiral galaxy for the first time she said it felt almost sinful to be enjoying astronomy so much, now that it was her job and the source of her livelihood.\nAs the war was finishing, she applied for a postdoctoral fellowship at the Mount Wilson observatory in Los Angeles. Drawn by the sheer size of the telescopes being built in theUS, she was turned down because she was a woman, and would have had to spend nights at the observatory with married men. Writing in 1994, she recalled that the rejection opened her eyes to gender-based discrimination, \u201cA guiding operational principle in my life was activated: If frustrated in one\u2019s endeavour by a stone wall or any kind of blockage, one must find a way around it \u2014 another route towards one\u2019s goal. This is advice I have given to many women facing similar situations.\u201d\nRemaining in Britain, she met her future husband, who was a theoretical physicist at UCL, in late 1947, and six months later they were married. Her enthusiasm for the universe persuaded him to turn his talents to astrophysics too. She finally made it to the US in 1951 with a position at the University of Chicago\u2019s Yerkes observatory in Wisconsin. Although she would occasionally return to Britain over the coming decades, she made the States her home, and became a naturalised US citizen in 1977.\nShe applied again to join the staff at Mount Wilson in 1955, and was again turned down because of her sex. So her husband applied and won the post. Margaret then took over the fellowship he had been chasing at nearby Caltech, the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. When he went observing, she went along as his assistant. In reality, however, she operated the telescope and ran the observing programme that would contribute to the B2FH paper.\nIn 1962 the Burbidges became professors at the UC San Diego, and a decade later Margaret returned to the UK on secondment to become director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, at that point based at Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex. Until then the post had carried with it the title of astronomer royal. However, she was not conferred this honour, breaking more than 300 years of tradition, something she would sometimes put down to politics and sometimes to sexism.\nIn the same year she took a stand against the American Astronomical Society (AAS) by refusing to accept the Annie Jump Cannon award, given for distinguished contributions to astronomy. Her reason was that it was only awarded to female astronomers, and in her letter to the committee she explained that \u201cit is high time that discrimination in favour of, as well as against, women in professional life be removed\u201d.\nIn response the AAS convened a working group to investigate the status of women in astronomy. In 1974 Burbidge returned to the US, and two years later was elected the first female president of the AAS. In the subsequent decades she worked across many areas of astrophysics, and helped to develop the Faint Object Spectrograph, one of the original instruments for the Hubble space telescope.\nShe retired in 1988, and subsequently became professor emeritus. In 2005 she and her husband were jointly awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nGeoffrey died in 2010. Margaret is survived by their daughter, Sarah, and a grandson, Conner.\n Eleanor Margaret Burbidge, astronomer, born 12 August 1919; died 5 April 2020\n This article was amended on 12 May 2020. The institution that Margaret Burbidge became director of in 1972 was the Royal Greenwich Observatory rather than the Royal Observatory Greenwich.",

Hundreds of armed police thwarted an attempt to loot a shopping mall near Cape Town on Wednesday.\nEarlier in the week hundreds of people in the Mitchell Plains township fought running battles with the police, hurling rocks and setting up street barricades with burning tyres, over undelivered food parcels.\nSouth Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world and has a tradition of street protests against authorities\u2019 failures to provide basic services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous situation,\u201d said Scott Drimie, of the thinktank Southern Africa Food Lab. \u201cWhen you add hunger to that, now there\u2019s deprivation \u2026 and then you add the enforcement with the army and police, that needs to be handled very carefully.\u201d\nThe Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies said that if people could not get food, \u201cthere is every likelihood of violent conflict, including widespread looting.\u201d\nThe latest government figures show 118,000 people have been charged with breaking the lockdown restrictions.\nThe defence minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, confirmed the decision to mobilise the army on Wednesday. \u201cIf you look at the numbers and the rate at which the infection has gone up, you will realise that at some point we may actually need the kind of human deployment which has never been seen before,\u201d she told local radio.\nSome serious crimes have fallen dramatically during the lockdown, according to figures released on Wednesday. Murders are down by 72% in the last month compared with the same period last year, assaults have fallen by 85% and violent robbery by 70%.\nThe police minister, Bheki Cele, said more than 190 roadblocks had been put in place daily countrywide and more than 680 vehicle checkpoints. \u201cRaids have been conducted which have seen illegal liquor outlets shut down and non-essential services such as mines, factories and other companies busted,\u201d Cele said on Wednesday.\nFigures also show a sharp fall in recorded gender-based violence, though experts and activists said this was probably due to the difficulties women faced in reaching police or others to report attacks.\nTina Thiart, a trustee of 1,000 Women One Voice, an NGO that works through grassroots initiatives to tackle violence against women and children, said women were locked up with abusers and reports to the NGO of gender-based violence had \u201creally spiked\u201d.\n\u201cThe stats we get from everywhere \u2026 we believe it is much higher. It comes in waves but this time it feels a lot worse. There\u2019s a real problem in the camps that have been set up for homeless. We are getting calls from affluent households too,\u201d Thiart said.\nExperts said a rise in reports of abuse of children also suggested an increase in gender-based violence.\nLast week Ramaphosa said he had ordered that family protection police units be reinforced because \u201cwomen and girls are being terrorised inside their own homes, forcing them to make desperate calls for help.\u201d\nSouth Africa\u2019s efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 have been widely praised. The country has drawn on long experience of fighting infectious diseases to launch an ambitious screening and testing campaign involving tens of thousands of medical personnel seeking out hotspots of infection.\nHowever, with winter approaching there are fears of a rapid rise in cases if the lockdown is lifted too soon.",

I know hospitals have plenty of free beds to treat me, that I can get tested should I feel difficulty in breathing (for my husband, who belongs to the \u201cat-risk group\u201d, a call to the GP was sufficient to get the test done the same day), that healthcare staff have the necessary equipment, that, despite more than 4,500 Covid-19 patients dying so far, the death rate is one of the lowest in the world \u2013 but then I am lucky: since February I am stuck in Bavaria, one of the worst-affected areas in Germany.\nThe contrast is glaring. German politicians appeal to the public for understanding of their decisions to curb personal freedoms, they don\u2019t need to justify their inaction. German politicians, together with their scientific advisers, explain the reasons for harsh measures, they don\u2019t write off experts. German politicians don\u2019t need to hark back to a glorious wartime spirit, that hardly anyone alive remembers. With their refusal to join an EU procurement scheme for essential equipment, the British government has put Brexit ideology over people\u2019s lives. It is the conceited self-importance of a political elite that regards politics as a continuation of the fun they had in Oxbridge debating societies, that is at the heart of their inability to deal with a serious crisis.Christine FuchsGmund, Bavaria, Germany\n Rear Admiral Mathias (Letters, 19 April) may have missed the primary target in his very reasonable summary of Matt Hancock\u2019s performance. In any crisis leadership is critical. It seems clear that Boris Johnson\u2019s commitment and involvement in the Covid-19 crisis can be questioned. This, plus his other characteristics, means he seems to have appointed ministers and advisers who will not threaten his authority. The cabinet are relatively inexperienced and young. Is this because he would feel threatened by older, more experienced colleagues?\nOf great concern are Covid-19 death rates compared with other countries. Poor leadership has resulted in continued inadequate PPE, contact tracing and testing. Policy on social isolation remains confused, airport arrivals are still not being screened, and transport without distancing is being widely used.\nIn summary, Johnson is responsible, and with a more committed, hardworking, efficient and wise leader, the current situation would have looked a lot better. Wise action can belatedly still make a difference: leadership roles should now go to those who are competent.Paul AbramsHonorary professor of urology, University of Bristol\n China is being criticised for only now beginning to give a more accurate number of deaths in Wuhan by increasing its figures by 50% (China denies cover-up as Wuhan coronavirus deaths revised up 50%, 17 April). How is that any different from our government\u2019s insistence on using only Covid-19 deaths in hospital for their daily figures?\nOffice for National Statistics figures for the period up to the end of March show 3,372 deaths in England and Wales only where Covid-19 was the underlying cause; hospital deaths accounting for only 1,789 of these. So an understatement of the government by significantly more than the Chinese increase.\nIt\u2019s time the media to began holding the government to account for persistently understating the problem.Andrew LamkowskiTaunton, Somerset \n \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

On 25 March, as they reached the Caribbean island of Bequia, after 25 days of no internet access, they switched on their phones.\n\u201cWe bought some data and I remember Ryan reading out the news and our jaws just dropped,\u201d said Elena. \u201cIt was hard to grasp the scale of it at first,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cIf you were waking up from a coma now, I think it would be hard to imagine the scale of what had unfolded.\u201d\nElena is from Lombardy in northern Italy, one of the regions most affected by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIf you don\u2019t read the news for a month and then you turn on your phone it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a news feed that tells you exactly what has happened every day, so I could only really access the previous week\u2019s news,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt was about three days [after we arrived] that Ryan found a 10-day old article in the New York Times that said my home town [of Bergamo] was the worst-hit in the world. I had had absolutely no idea. I called my dad and he said: \u2018Oh you found out. Don\u2019t panic. It\u2019s all right\u2019.\n\u201cThe news only truly sank in when we saw the pictures of the military trucks in front of the cemetery in my hometown because they had run out of space and coffins. That was the most shocking moment.\u201d\nThe couple, both in their early thirties, have been living on a sailing boat since 2017, documenting their lives on their YouTube channel. Unable to afford to buy a house where they were living in Manchester, they decided to buy a small boat and explore the world on a tiny budget, making a living from bits of freelance copywriting and graphic design work on their laptops.\nThe long journey across the Atlantic was a big challenge, for which the couple had done a lot of preparation. During the crossing the only means of communication they had was a satellite device capable of receiving 160 character messages, which they asked their family and friends not to use to send them bad news.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a common thing for sailors not to want bad news when they are on an ocean crossing because there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do about it,\u201d said Elena. \u201cAll you can do is cry, scream, worry, but you can\u2019t turn around because the wind is behind you and is very strong.\u201d\nThey received a sign that something was seriously wrong as they approached the Caribbean. \u201cWe were about two days away when someone sent us a list of all the islands that had closed their borders, and we started to get worried that, by the time arrived, we wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to go,\u201d said Ryan.\n\u201cWe thought they were just being especially careful [about coronavirus] because most of the islands don\u2019t really have healthcare infrastructure,\u201d said Elena. \u201cWe thought it was all a preventative measure rather than a containment measure.\u201d\nThe pair are now safely anchored in Bequia, an island in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, on which there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s a very surreal experience landing in a place where everything feels almost normal, while the news tells you that the world is shut down,\u201d said Elena.\n\u201cWe\u2019re torn between these two realities. We are in this amazing place \u2013 we are super lucky and super grateful \u2013 while in the meantime people are dying and are in hospital.\u201d\nAll the couple can do for now is \u2013 like many in their home countries \u2013 wait for the pandemic to pass. \u201cWe are just going to sit tight,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cAnd hope that by the winter and the end of hurricane season, the borders will be back open and we can carry on exploring\u201d.",

Dreyfuss plays a retired civil engineer who, all his life, has dreamed of going to space and is now in with a chance of winning a golden ticket. The role is a nice mirror to Close Encounters, in which Dreyfuss ditched his wife and kids to fly off with the little green men.\nHere he is a family-oriented man who nursed his wife through dementia and is adored by his grownup daughter. He has lived a good life but perhaps stifles a pang of regret at the average-ness of it all. It\u2019s a film of tender feelings, though perhaps a little predictable and bluntly sentimental.\nDreyfuss is Angus Stewart, a 75-year-old with a dodgy ticker living in a nursing home. His face subtly registers the indignities of the care home regime: dinner at the nursery appointed hour of 5pm, tickings off from staff who talk to residents as if they were naughty puppies. It\u2019s Angus\u2019s grandson who persuades him to enter a lottery to win a seat on the first commercial flight into space, which is being bankrolled by an obsessive tech billionaire (Colm Feore). Of course, Angus makes the shortlist of 12 finalists.\nIn a minor way, the plot becomes unexpectedly timely; experts are split on a life-and-death matter. Angus, an authority on road surfacing, spots a major safety issue with the flight runway. Who will the billionaire trust \u2013 his team of expensive consultants or the old timer?\nIt\u2019s a big-hearted if formulaic tale, with a few plot implausibilities: for instance, at one point Angus sweet talks his way past security at the launch site\u2019s barbed wire gate. And, for a movie that is making a point about how the wisdom of older people is overlooked, its care home residents come dangerously close to looking like patronising stereotypes.\n Astronaut is available on streaming platforms on 27 April.",

The measures may be put in place alongside Trump\u2019s plan to use government funds to buy domestic crude to help keep the industry afloat.\nUS senator Ted Cruz said on Twitter on Tuesday: \u201cMy message to the Saudis: TURN THE TANKERS THE HELL AROUND.\u201d\nShipping experts told the Reuters news agency that Saudi Arabia may try to reroute the tankers to markets in Europe and Asia which may have space in their oil storage facilities for extra crude.\nThe Saudis have limited time to find a home for their crude cargoes. The biggest oil storage facility in the US \u2013 at Cushing in Oklahoma \u2013 is likely to run out of space within the next three weeks and global storage facilities may be full by the end of next month.\nUS oil prices turned negative this week for the first time ever as oil producers without access to storage space began paying customers to take their barrels from next month, and global oil prices have reached 21-year lows.\nThe price for US crude in June is under $15 a barrel and the price of Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, dropped to $15.98 a barrel for the first time since 1999 on Tuesday night before climbing back above $20 on Wednesday.\nBj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, said the world\u2019s onshore oil storage would be filled to the brim by the first week of May and the market should brace for unprecedented low prices in the weeks ahead.\nIn previous weeks oil traders have held hope that prices could be kept afloat by a deal to rein in oil production, but Tonhaugen said rising storage levels had given rise to panic.\n\u201cTraders have exhausted their \u2018hope storage\u2019 and have nothing else to count on,\u201d he said. \u201cPrices can go to unprecedented low levels even for Brent as, unless there are further cuts announced, storage capacity will just not be enough.\u201d\nHe said unless there was \u201ca massive shock\u201d such as oil well shutdowns equivalent to cutting millions of barrels from global production or an earlier than expected lifting of lockdown measures, oil may soon be \u201ccheaper than a latte\u201d.",

Fabric that might have gone into one garment has been switched to another more appropriate to demand,\u201d she said.\nThe company said it was confident its warehouses were operating safely after introducing measures to ensure physical distancing.\nBoohoo has faced criticism from some workers and the Usdaw union about inadequate personal protection equipment and working practices.

The terms of Bonura\u2019s release to house arrest allow his movement for health-related appointments.\nIn recent weeks judges also ordered the release from prison of Vincenzino Iannazzo, 65, and Rocco Santo Filippone, 72, both alleged \u2019Ndrangheta bosses. Judges feared that a Covid-19 infection could be lethal for Filippone since he suffers from serious cardio-vascular disease.\n\u201cIt is a very alarming situation,\u201d said Leo Beneduci, secretary general of Osapp, Italy\u2019s largest prison police officers\u2019 union. \u201cIn Italy there are approximately 12,000 members of criminal organisations in prison. Members of the penitentiary police have begun reporting detainees who embrace each other with the alleged goal of increasing the possibility of contracting the virus and getting released from prison.\u201d\nThe department of penitentiary police circulated an internal memo, seen by the Guardian, asking prison officials for the names of prisoners suffering from specific illnesses and who are over the age of 70 because they are \u201cat risk of complications in case of Covid-19 infection\u201d.\nThere are currently 74 bosses over 70 and with serious health conditions held under article 41-bis of the Italian penal code, which allows the authorities to suspend usual prison entitlements with the aim of severing ties with criminal associates on the outside. The prisoners include Leoluca Bagarella, 78, a Sicilian boss responsible for dozens of homicides, Raffaele Cutolo, 78, the leader of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, currently serving multiple life sentences for murder, the bloodstained bosses of the Bellocco clan of the \u2019Ndrangheta and the Sicilian \u201cboss of bosses\u201d Nitto Santapaola, 81.\nThe president of Sicily\u2019s antimafia commission, Claudio Fava, said he feared mafia bosses could leverage the coronavirus crisis to secure their release. \u201cAs infections have begun to wane, [potentially] releasing bosses in isolation under 41-bis, like Santapaola and Bagarella, is hypocritical and an offence toward the thousands of elderly victims of this virus,\u201d said Fava, whose father, Giuseppe, was killed by the mafia on Santapaola\u2019s orders.\nThe justice minister, Alfonso Bonafede, clarified on Wednesday that the decision to release Mafiosi was not taken by the government and that he would look into the reports.\n\u201cThe risk is that we\u2019ll find the mafia virus on the streets alongside Covid-19,\u201d said Lirio Abbate, journalist and national editor of L\u2019Espresso, who currently lives under police protection after receiving numerous death threats from the mafia. \u201cIt would be a double pandemic that we mustn\u2019t allow to happen.\u201d",

        "content": "We\u2019re experiencing something that has never happened before. New weekly data shows how quickly employment fell in the second half of March\nData released this week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in conjunction with the Australian Taxation Office reveals that at least 6% of workers have lost their job over the past month, with the accommodation and food and arts and recreation industries absolutely smashed by the impact of the coronavirus.\nOne of the problems with the standard data releases is that while they are nice and regular, during times of big shocks, they can also be somewhat out of date. The GDP figures for example only come out every three months \u2013 and the next lot released on 3 June will only cover the months January to March.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they are unimportant, but it makes them less valuable when attempting to formulate policy in a fast-changing economy.\nWe saw another example of this when the latest unemployment figures for March only showed a small rise from 5.1% to 5.2%. The survey for each month\u2019s labour force figures covers the first two weeks of each month, and in March the real employment carnage happened in the last two weeks.\nThat is why the ABS should be congratulated for the work they have been doing to provide more up-to-date information on a range of areas such as retail sales and jobs.\nThis week the bureau, together with the ATO, has been able to present the weekly change in employment and wages since the start of the year.\nWe normally don\u2019t care about such \u201coriginal\u201d data, because it is too noisy:\n\u201cOriginal\u201d data, for example, doesn\u2019t take into account that jobs usually dry up in January and then come back in February as firms start hiring after the summer breaks. Usually we look at the trend or the seasonally adjusted figures which takes what has happened in the past into account.\nBut nothing like what is happening now has happened in the past.\nThis is why original data now is very useful because it shows just how quickly employment began to fall in the second half of March:\nWhile the fall in jobs was pretty similar for both women and men, there were large differences across age groups.\nIn the last two weeks of March, employment fell 6% for all workers, but for those under 20 and over 70 it dropped by 9%.\nThe most secure were those in their 50s, and yet they even experienced a stunning 4% fall in jobs:\nThe likelihood of losing a job was also very much dependent upon what industry you worked in.\nEducation is the only industry to employ more people in the first week of April than it did in the first week of March. But accommodation and food services, and the arts and recreation industries are clearly the ones that have suffered the biggest falls:\nA quarter of those in the hospitality industry and one in five of those in the arts and recreation industry who were working in March no longer have a job.\nThe loss of jobs in those two industries directly echoes the timing of the lockdown and forced closure of restaurants and arts and sporting events:\nWe can see how out of whack these overall figures are when we compare this original data with what has happened over the past 15 years.\nUsually February sees a strong increase in jobs, followed by small increases or even a dip in March and then generally a bit of an increase in April (besides February, the best months to get a job are September and December).\nSo far this year we were seeing that play out \u2013 but if the numbers released this week continue, we will see April drop completely out of the scope of what occurred even during the GFC:\nWhat this will mean for unemployment is hard to gauge.\nHow the jobseeker numbers will affect the \u201cunemployed\u201d numbers is mostly guesswork at this stage. Also on a month-to-month basis there is not much correlation between employment growth and changes in unemployment.\nBut if we look at annual changes we can get some idea of what is going to happen.\nUsually we need employment each year to grow around 1.7% to keep the unemployment rate stable:\nIn the early 1980s and 1990s recessions when employment fell by 3.5%, unemployment rose by between 2.5 percentage points and 3.9 percentage points.\nA fall of 6%? That would have us looking at best at a four percentage point rise \u2013 to around 9.2%. And that\u2019s if all goes well.\nWe await the full data to show the economic damage of the coronavirus. But what we have seen already suggests we are experiencing something that has never happened before, and it is very scary indeed.\n Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The feeling has only grown stronger as I sit alone, writing these thoughts with a fever as the death toll from coronavirus in the US continues to climb.\nI\u2019d spent two months studying in Apia, the capital of the Pacific nation, with a group of 14 American students, learning about the resiliency of Pacific communities in the face of climate change and globalisation.\nMy escape must start with an introduction of our program director, Dr Fetaomi Tapu-Qiliho, and her fleet of conveniently positioned cousins. Dr Taomi, as we call her, has experience with national emergencies. She\u2019d maintained her students\u2019 safety and programs through the 2006 military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Fiji and the 2019 measles epidemic in Samoa. But this was a global emergency, and the struggle swiftly developed into one of getting us home, not assuring our stay.\nThe School for International Training (SIT) cancelled our program on a Monday and the one flight per week connecting Samoa and Hawaii leaves every Friday. Under the assumption we\u2019d be leaving at that time, we took full advantage of the four open days to say goodbye \u2014 an evening of song with our host families, one last night swim off the sea wall and a trip to the island Savai\u2019i. Our last afternoon on Savai\u2019i, my friend Lily received a call at the boardwalk. It was her mom, stuck in the Netherlands, calling to tell her nearly her entire family across three US states had contracted coronavirus. I was sitting near Lily when she found out; she seemed to sob and laugh simultaneously, the news still unprocessed. I listened to the ocean as I waited for her to hang up; this strange tide was coming in, whether or not we were ready.\nI noticed an unnamable tension on the ferry ride back from Savai\u2019i. People had begun to wear masks and step more carefully around me. There were suspected cases quarantined near the airport, and the government of Samoa, unbeknownst to us, was preparing to enter a state of emergency. As we packed, they ordered the airport control tower to reroute our plane to Nadi, Fiji, as no planes from the US were to land in Samoa.\nWhen the news came, I spent the night glued to my phone, communicating furiously with my 14 counterparts and Dr Taomi. She\u2019d reworked the plan\u2014we\u2019d fly to Nadi in two days and catch our flight to Honolulu from there. But just a few hours later, Samoa, American Samoa, Fiji and Tonga closed their borders. The flight to Nadi ceased to exist. I called my parents, but couldn\u2019t tell them when I\u2019d be home.\nThe next day, Dr Taomi moved us into a house owned by her church community, who generously prepared a meal for our arrival. At lunch, the news broke that all the suspected cases in Samoa tested negative. People were cheering and pulling out all the Vailima beer and wine they could reach beneath the massive cow in the freezer. Our exit plans were indefinite, but I found profound joy and acceptance in that home. For four days, we danced, cooked and rested together as the US embassy navigated diplomatic discussions with the Samoan government and the governor of American Samoa to aid our exit.\nAmerican Samoa is just 70km east of the independent nation of Samoa, but as it is a US territory, it looked like our surest route home to the mainland US.\nDr Taomi had a cousin who offered to fly us to American Samoa on a chartered flight, we just needed clearance. Once in American Samoa, we could catch one remaining flight scheduled to leave the territory for Hawai\u2019i the next week.\nOne night during a group meeting, a mass breakout of 36 prisoners at the Tanumalala prison occurred. At that point, I wasn\u2019t surprised, it seemed a reasonable addition to the chaos. Dr Taomi jumped to her feet and called another cousin \u2013 this time, one who ran a security company. The guards who came lounged in plastic chairs on the lawn, joking and watching the streets flash red and blue all night long.\nWe were to see those lights again on our journey home, this time after we had made it to American Samoa and were huddled in the back of a yellow school bus racing along the coast toward a quarantine facility. Police escorts surrounded us, alarming the locals as if we were the virus itself.\nOther Americans joined us at Sadie\u2019s By The Sea, a beachfront hotel co-opted by the Department of Health to quarantine transiting travellers. During our three-day stay, we were divided into rooms and asked to go no further than our porches, but that didn\u2019t break our group morale. We conference-called on the hotel phones and leaned from the porch pillars to see each other.

Kennedy, a working-class Irish woman who died shortly after contracting the coronavirus, \u201cwasn\u2019t alone\u201d on that final journey home.\nAcross the UK capital, where Kennedy lived for over 50 years, friends and loved ones marked the moment the plane took off by lighting a candle, saying a prayer, or singing a song. The Irish Pensioners Choir, of which Kennedy was a leading member, overcame many technical difficulties to lend their voice to a video of the song Going Home that was widely shared on social media and played later at her funeral in Clonaslee, county Laois.\nThe 83-year-old, who was described as an \u201cadventurous\u201d woman, lived in a council block in Kentish Town, north London. After retiring from her job at John Lewis, she had been the chair of the Irish Elderly Advice Network (IEAN) for more than 10 years.\nKennedy was said to have taken a whole new lease on life after retiring. She busked at Westminster station as part of the choir, took leading roles in plays, and was set to perform in Trafalgar Square on St Patrick\u2019s Day.\nAs well as her fond memories of Kennedy, Nora Mulready, head of culture at the IEAN, spoke of her frustration with the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic and delay in advising people to stay home. \u201cAlice was sat in my office on the day we made the decision to close everything and we were putting the house in order to shut down everything.\n\u201cShe said to me: \u2018The minute the prime minister tells me to stay at home, I\u2019ll stay at home and not come back out.\u2019 She trusted the prime minister, she trusted the government, but that advice came very late. I definitely think lives have been lost that didn\u2019t need to be lost because for some reason the prime minister didn\u2019t give the advice early enough to older people.\u201d\nMulready described Kennedy as \u201can incredible ambassador for older people\u201d who constantly challenged people\u2019s perception of older people in how she lived her life and how she encouraged others to.\nTributes came flooding in after news of Kennedy\u2019s death, including from the Irish president, Michael D Higgins.\nIn a letter to the family, Higgins wrote: \u201cI have long been an admirer of Alice\u2019s work as chair of the Irish Elderly Advice Network and the driving force behind the Irish Pensioners\u2019 Choir.\n \u201cAlice epitomised what is best in Ireland\u2019s diaspora, having made such a valuable contribution over several decades as an active leader within London\u2019s Irish Community.\n \u201cAlice was a most noble daughter of Ireland and her service to her community was immense.\u201d\nWhile London wasn\u2019t her final resting place, Mulready said the city was also her home. \u201cShe represents the immigrant story and dilemma \u2013 the dual pull of two places. She was a Londoner, but she was county Laois, and as Irish as they come.\u201d",

        "content": "Teachers making hundreds of phone calls a week to check on at-risk pupils as just 5% attend school during lockdown\nThe government has been urged to consider making it compulsory for vulnerable children to go to school during the Covid-19 lockdown, as it emerged that teachers were making hundreds of phone calls a week to keep track of at-risk pupils.\nThe children\u2019s minister, Vicky Ford, faced a barrage of questions from MPs on the education select committee on Wednesday after official government statistics revealed that just 5% of vulnerable children who were entitled to a place in the emergency schools still open during the coronavirus crisis were turning up.\nTom Hunt, Conservative MP for Ipswich, questioned whether it should be left to parents to decide whether or not their children attend school. \u201cIt could be the case that sometimes these parents are part of the reason why the child is vulnerable,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt does seem as though the government needs to take stock of this and potentially consider making it a requirement that all vulnerable children should be at school.\u201d\nWhile many teachers are worried about low attendance, others say the word vulnerable covers a wide range of circumstances. According to the government definition, it includes children with a social worker or an educational, health and care plan for those with special educational needs.\n\u201cI am frustrated with this notion of the headlines that suggest that they must all be in school,\u201d said Caroline Barlow, head of Heathfield community college in East Sussex. \u201cNot all vulnerable students are vulnerable because of their immediate family and many are better at home right now.\u201d\nOther school leaders said attendance may be low because the message to vulnerable families is confused \u2013 on the one hand they are urged to stay at home in order to be safe, while on the other they are being encouraged to send their children to school.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern that there are low numbers,\u201d said Rachael Warwick, executive headteacher of the Ridgeway education trust in south Oxfordshire where just a handful of vulnerable pupils have been attending school. \u201cBut the public health message has been so strong.\u201d\nAlison Finley, safeguarding lead and assistant principal at Crawshaw academy, a secondary school with 1,000 pupils in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, bought 20 cheap mobile phones for her team just before lockdown. Since then she and colleagues have made 1,500 phone calls to vulnerable families and 58 home visits.\n\u201cThe majority said they did not want to come in to school. Some of them said they felt they could look after [their children] better at home. They said it was too dangerous for them to come in to school and their children were too worried.\u201d\nWith 10 or fewer vulnerable pupils in school, staff are making regular phone calls home. The highest-risk families are called daily, those that are of concern but are lower risk are called three times a week, while others are contacted once a week.\nWhere concerns are raised, staff pay a home visit. \u201cUltimately you have to go out and find them. So far we\u2019ve made contact with every single student,\u201d said Finley, who said there had been an increase in domestic violence and mental health problems in families.\nStuart Lock, the head of Advantage Schools trust in Bedford, which runs a primary and secondary school, said the key issue was the safety of pupils, whether they were staying at home or coming to school.\n\u201cWe know for a small minority of pupils, they find their home circumstances difficult. When we set work online, we get pupils to check in with an online form every day by 9.30am. This invites them to tell us whether they and everyone in their family are safe and well and we can chase up if they say they are not.\n\u201cWe also have a very small number of pupils who we have in school because it supports their families and they are particularly struggling \u2013 but this doesn\u2019t apply to the majority of pupils who we might consider vulnerable. Our pastoral staff in each school also make telephone contact with pupils and families where we know we have had concerns in the past.\u201d\nEd Vainker, executive principal of the Reach Academy Feltham, an all-through school in Hounslow, said: \u201cWe have gone from 5% of looked-after children and those involved in social care in school before Easter, to 35% this week. We wanted to get those pupils into school once things settled and we had a strong steer from the local authority to get them back in.\n\u201cI do think the numbers in school are only one piece of the puzzle - we are speaking to our vulnerable pupils and their families daily. We are also distributing 2,000 meals weekly, and we are checking in with those families and others very regularly.\u201d\nAddressing MPs\u2019 concerns, Ford said: \u201cPeople are very concerned that they don\u2019t want to get coronavirus and I can absolutely understand that.\n\u201cWe make it very clear that children who have a social worker are expected to attend school. And if they are not, their schools are working with their social workers to make sure we have eyes on them, that they get visits \u2013 whether or not that\u2019s a physical visit, a doorstep visit, a house visit, or a digital visit \u2013 depending on the risk to that child.\n\u201cJust because the attendance at school may be low that doesn\u2019t mean that those children are not being safeguarded in other ways.\u201d",

Universities are not prepared because they\u2019re firefighting with emergency responses to Covid-19.\u201d\nSince the lockdown began, several black academics and educators have posted accounts on Twitter of racist \u201czoombombings\u201d, where uninvited guests abuse the popular video service to broadcast offensive content. These incidents, which occurred in non-university lectures and seminars, have included being targeted with racial slurs, such as the N-word, by people wearing Ku Klux Klan-style robes.\nExperts on online harassment said universities\u2019 own computer networks were also vulnerable to abuse. They pointed to a recently leaked report on data security at Warwick University, which found it lacked internet filter software to block students and staff from accessing inappropriate or illegal material.\nThe internal audit of cyber security, seen by the Guardian, also found that IT monitoring at the university, which has been criticised for its handling of a \u201crape chat\u201d scandal, was \u201cnot sufficiently robust to be useful to investigate and treat a cyber security issue\u201d.\nAndy Phippen, professor of digital rights at Bournemouth University, said the failings identified by the report were unlikely to be limited to Warwick. A freedom of information investigation he undertook last year revealed that most universities lacked adequate policies or procedures to address online harassment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen no evidence of improvement since then,\u201d Phippen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant risk of more incidents as universities switch to online education.\u201d\nRachel Watters, NUS women\u2019s officer, said: \u201cThe sudden shift to mass online learning on new platforms has revealed weaknesses in policy and practice in relation to online misconduct and harassment. NUS urges institutions to safeguard students and staff using video conferencing, and to hold perpetrators accountable through disciplinary procedures.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents 137 higher education institutions, said online safeguarding has been a key consideration in the shift to delivering more education online.\nA Warwick University spokesman said it had invested significant time, effort and resources in the past two years \u2013 and recruited 19 new staff \u2013 to systematically tackling the complex and urgent challenges that information security and data protection posed.\nHe added: \u201cOn online teaching we continue to refine and enhance the security around each initiative that has been developed to introduce more online teaching in these challenging new times.\u201d\nA Zoom spokesman said it was deeply upset to hear about abuse on the app. \u201cZoom strongly condemns such behaviour and is committed to providing educators with the tools and resources they need on a safe and secure platform,\u201d he said.",

This is to help stop the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d\nBut the Guardian has spoken to a number of those who were moved suddenly, on condition of anonymity, as well as outreach workers who say they have significant concerns. They describe their situation as \u201calmost like prison\u201d, with strictly enforced meal collection times and no access to food or drink other than water outside those hours, and some say they cannot open their bedroom windows.\nOne man, S, said he was given 30 minutes to pack up the flat where he had been living since he arrived in Scotland from Saudi Arabia five months ago. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me any information, but said it was on the orders of the Home Office. Nobody knows how long we will be here.\u201d\nThe\n Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is \nresponding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

There is no social distancing in the meals area and all the food is uncovered. I would like to buy some juice or fruit for my room but they told me my [Home Office issued] card won\u2019t work any more.\u201d\nAnother, M, said: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to get close to people when you\u2019re in the lift or getting your food, and there are two bottles of hand sanitiser among 80 people. There are many Muslims here and Ramadan begins in two days. The evening meal stops at 8pm, so what happens when we start fasting?\u201d\nWhile outreach workers say Mears has promised to make arrangements for those fasting, and to provide prayer mats, none of the asylum seekers to whom the Guardian spoke had been told this.\nAlthough the hotels have wifi, support workers point out that without cash, people cannot top up their phones to continue communication with lawyers, or buy extra food or hand sanitiser.\nGary Christie, the head of policy at the Scottish Refugee Council, said: \u201cPeople tell us they\u2019ve been moved into hotels at very short notice and without a proper explanation of why they\u2019re being moved, how long for, or what will happen next. It\u2019s confusing and frightening and raises serious concerns about how the Home Office communicates and shares vital information.\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t stay in hotels forever. We need to know how the Home Office plans to accommodate people when lockdown restrictions ease, so charities, local authorities and other partners can support any further moves. We\u2019re also really concerned that people in hotels are not receiving cash support that\u2019s needed for phone top-ups and other essentials.\u201d\nThe vast majority of those moved are either new arrivals, some of whom have been in the system for months awaiting decisions on their substantive asylum claim, or those who cannot return to their county of origin because of the pandemic. They were previously receiving financial support either in cash or through a payment card.\nA Mears spokesperson said lockdown measures had severely limited the company\u2019s capacity to utilise short-term let accommodation for new asylum applicants.\nThey said: \u201cTherefore we had no alternative but to procure hotel space where we can safely and appropriately house and support each person with food and health services without restriction on time of residence.\n\u201cAll movement of the people concerned was undertaken in accordance with health authority guidance on social distancing and use of PPE. The safety and wellbeing of each person is paramount and Mears are working hard to ensure we meet all obligations at this very difficult time.\u201d\nThe Home Office said that accommodation would be reviewed \u201cprior to the end of June\u201d.",

        "content": "Mattia Binotto has warned Ferrari will consider their Formula One future if severe budget caps are imposed. The coronavirus pandemic has hit the sport\u2019s finances hard but the team principal has advised against making hasty decisions and believes the proposed cuts in teams\u2019 budgets risked devaluing F1 as the pinnacle of motor sport.\nIn 2019 teams agreed to a budget cap of $175m (\u00a3142m) for 2021 but, with nine races called off this season and F1\u2019s coffers depleted, last week the teams met the FIA and Formula One\u2019s owners to discuss spending limits. Setting a ceiling of $145m for 2021, moving to $130m in 2022, was on the table but they failed to reach an agreement and Binotto was emphatic that Ferrari would be prepared to walk away from F1 should the lower figure be enforced.\n\u201cThe $145m level is already a new and demanding request compared to what was set out last June,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt cannot be attained without further significant sacrifices, especially in terms of our human resources. If it was to get even lower, we would not want to be put in a position of having to look at other further options for deploying our racing DNA.\u201d\nFerrari, the only team to have been competing in F1 since the first championship in 1950, have form in threatening to leave the sport but now there is a real sense that the Modena-based team are unwilling to concede any more ground and that the reduced budget cap was being wielded both too quickly and improperly.\n\u201cF1, we have all sorts of teams with different characteristics,\u201d Binotto said. \u201cThey operate in different countries, under different legislation and with their own ways of working. Therefore it is not simple and straightforward to make structural changes simply by cutting costs in a linear fashion.\n\u201cWe are well aware that F1 and indeed the whole world right now is going through a particularly difficult time because of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, this is not the time to react in a hurry as there\u2019s a risk of making decisions on the back of this emergency without clearly evaluating all the consequences.\u201d\nRed Bull\u2019s principal, Christian Horner, is also strongly resistant to a cap below $145m despite lobbying from smaller teams, with McLaren arguing for a target of $100m. Binotto warned, however, that there was danger such a level could fundamentally change the sport for the worse.\n\u201cF1 has to be the pinnacle of motor sport in terms of technology and performance. It must be attractive for the car manufacturers and the sponsors who want to be linked to this most prestigious category. If we restrict costs excessively then we run the risk of reducing the level considerably, bringing it ever closer to the lower formulae.\u201d\nFerrari want a more thorough examination of how the cap is reached, favouring a two-tier model that reflects the extra costs incurred in research and development of parts sold to customer teams. They are also fiercely defensive of their staff, none of whom have been furloughed, nor asked to take holiday when F1 imposed an early season shutdown.\nBinotto stressed Ferrari\u2019s \u201cethical duty\u201d to look after their personnel and avoid large-scale job losses. \u201cOne should not forget that companies play a role in the social fabric of a nation. They are not just there to make a profit.\u201d\nWith the fall in revenue hitting the smaller teams hardest, Binotto echoed Horner in confirming Ferrari would be in favour of supplying customer cars to them in the short term.\n\u201cIf the current emergency really put the existence of some of our competitors in this sport in doubt and made it necessary to revise certain cornerstones, then Ferrari would be open to it. It\u2019s not even sacrilegious, given it\u2019s happened before in F1 and happens today in series such as [motorcycling\u2019s] MotoGP.\u201d",

        "content": "Foreign Office accepted US claim that as the wife of a CIA agent Sacoolas had immunity \nBritain agreed to let Anne Sacoolas, the driver charged with killing 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn, return to the US on the basis of an \u201capparently illogical\u201d interpretation of the law on diplomatic immunity, according to the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office.\nThe description of this interpretation given to the foreign affairs select committee by Sir Simon McDonald, the permanent under-secretary and head of the diplomatic service, will add fuel to the efforts of the Dunn family to mount a judicial review of the Foreign Office\u2019s decision-making in the case.\nThe Foreign Office accepted a US government claim that as the wife of a CIA agent working at the US intelligence base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. She was allowed to return to the US with her family, days after driving her car on the wrong side of the road on 27 August and crashing into Dunn on his motorcycle.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has subsequently charged her with death by reckless driving, but the US government has rejected the British extradition request.\nIt has now emerged that the UK Foreign Office lawyers discussed her diplomatic status with their US state department counterparts in the immediate aftermath of Dunn\u2019s death \u2013 and initially advised British ministers on 30 August that there was legal ambiguity about her standing.\nBut then, according to a report in the Mail on Sunday, the Foreign Office told the Northamptonshire police on 2 September that Sacoolas had full immunity and no prosecution was possible. So within three full working days of the crash, the Foreign Office had sided with a US interpretation of what McDonald described to the committee as \u201ca recondite bit of law\u201d. Sacoolas left the UK on 16 September.\nIn the fullest high-level explanation of the events subsequent to Dunn\u2019s death, McDonald told the select committee on Tuesday: \u201cIn the case of Harry Dunn, the controversy was over an agreement made at the end of the last century over continuing immunities for US diplomats posted at the Croughton annex.\n\u201cIn that agreement the American authorities gave a pre-waiver for accredited diplomats so that was the formal position, but that agreement was silent on the rights of their dependants, and that has been the origin of a lot of the dispute. But our legal advice is that when an agreement is silent on something, then what pertained before still applies \u2013 i.e. immunity.\u201d\nMcDonald told committee members this was a \u201crecondite bit of law\u201d, and the interpretation of the law was \u201ca bit illogical\u201d.\nThe illogicality arose since the US and UK lawyers had mutually decided that, even though the immunity of the diplomat working at the base had clearly been waived by the US in the agreement, that of the dependant had not.\nChris Bryant, a Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee, said: \u201cIt seems surprising the Foreign Office would accept an anomaly such as a dependant of a diplomat enjoying greater immunity than the diplomat himself.\n\u201cYou would have expected at the very least that the Foreign Office would not side with this dubious American interpretation of the law, but instead leap to the defence of a British citizen.\u201d\nA subsequent internal Foreign Office review has concluded the legal status of dependants at the Croughton base was anomalous, and the UK is now seeking to renegotiate the agreement.\nMcDonald was clear that the only the Foreign Office, and not the police, can determine the issue of someone\u2019s diplomatic immunity: \u201cThe police force does not determine immunity. The police ask the Foreign Office about immunity matters.\u201d\n This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to correct the spelling of \u201cdependant\u201d.",

        "content": "Co-morbidities, demographics and societal imbalances all play a part, says UCL professor Nishi Chaturvedi\nOne explanation for why people from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are dying in disproportionately high numbers is demography. The virus hit London first and hit it hardest. But even when you take these regional differences into account there is a mismatch. In particular, if you take into account that ethnic minorities are generally younger \u2013 particularly important for Covid-19 where 90% of deaths are in people over 60 \u2013 the ethnic differences become even more stark.\nCo-morbidities could certainly play a role. The black population, where the discrepancy appears to be greatest, is particularly afflicted with hypertension. Diabetes is three-fold higher in this ethnic group. Both of those conditions will increase your risk of death once you\u2019ve got Covid. The added problem is that these conditions occur at a younger age in people of black descent. However, in mitigation against that, certainly older people of black African descent don\u2019t smoke as much, so have less respiratory disease, have lower rates of cancers and coronary disease. With Asian populations, the story is a bit different, but again there is a four-fold excess in diabetes and blood pressure rises higher with age in South Asians compared to Europeans.\nGenetics sounds like an easy get-out clause, but it isn\u2019t. Ethnicity is a complex socio-cultural construct, it\u2019s not a biology construct. There\u2019s no gene for being Asian. There\u2019s no gene for being black. People\u2019s ethnic group membership can change over time and with age, it\u2019s not an immutable thing and it very poorly maps on to any biology you can think of. People have looked to see if there\u2019s a genetic explanation for these ethnic differences in chronic disease and have been unable to find one, despite having looked quite hard in large numbers. So there\u2019s no evidence that genes explain the excess risk of Covid susceptibility. It\u2019s important to put a nail in that one because it feels as if we can abdicate any responsibility for sorting this out and this really isn\u2019t the case.\nEthnic minorities are over-represented in high-risk occupations, including health workers, in the transport sector and essential shop work. Clearly, there\u2019s a huge amount of heterogeneity, but overall ethnic minorities are more likely to live in deprived, dense, over-crowded urban areas and are more likely to be disadvantaged. In some cases, household composition could play a role, particularly in Asian households where you have multi-generational households living together.\nSo both through occupation and residential reasons, they\u2019re less able to socially isolate effectively and much more likely to be exposed to high doses of the virus. There\u2019s some suggestion that the greater the dose you\u2019re exposed to the more likely the disease is to prove fatal. That\u2019s perhaps one reason why even quite young healthcare workers are succumbing to the disease.\nThe evidence on ethnic differences in healthcare seeking behaviour is quite messy, and we need to remember that these are quite heterogeneous groups. For instance, people of black ancestry have been found to be less likely to consult for chronic diseases like diabetes, but that doesn\u2019t mean to say that if it\u2019s an acute condition they won\u2019t come forward. One study of people accessing antiviral flu treatments in the flu pandemic of 2009 found that ethnic minorities were less likely to ask and less likely to collect these. But whether this was due to reluctance, differences in access to healthcare, the way the message was put across or racism \u2013 it is difficult to pick apart because the healthcare seeking process is so complicated.\nUltimately, this is about health inequalities, about deprivation and affluence and how important socio-economic status is in determining health outcomes. This isn\u2019t just an ethnicity story, it affects all of us. Britain has a long history of health inequalities. It\u2019s critically important to understand and I\u2019m relieved that the government is taking this seriously.\nProf Chaturvedi is director of the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL",

Bryant then demands to know whether ministers were briefed about the other schemes.\nHancock faced further pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given \u201cample opportunity\u201d to join the EU scheme bulk-buying masks, gowns, gloves and goggles.\nAfter a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK\u2019s lack of involvement in the EU\u2019s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to opt out.\nThe commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and PPE.\nUK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because of a communication problem linked to missed emails.\nThe commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: \u201cThe EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings.\n\u201cThe UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.\u201d",

        "content": "An increasing number of Premier League clubs are actively discussing the possibility of bringing the season to an early end, with concerns \u00adgrowing over the feasibility of a return even behind closed doors.\nThe Premier League is suspended indefinitely and, last week, a meeting of the 20 clubs reaffirmed the intention to complete the season when it is \u201csafe and appropriate\u201d. Away from collective discussions, however, clubs are informally talking about the hurdles in the way of a return, with some asking whether the challenges will soon become too great.\nWest Ham\u2019s David Moyes yesterday became the first manager to publicly question whether the campaign will restart. He said he hoped to continue but added: \u201cThe deeper and deeper you look the harder you feel it is to get it up running again.\u201d\nThe Guardian has spoken to clubs who have raised a range of concerns including over finance and sporting integrity. The most immediate fear, however, regards medical safety.\nClubs were told last week that play would only resume once there was sufficient capacity for Covid-19 testing while a provisional medical plan has been drawn up with club doctors over how to minimise the risk of infection.\nBut the practicality of the plan was questioned by one club, who argued that players may have to be separated from their families for a month or more to make sure they are not infected. There is also the concern over the amount of testing required, with perhaps multiple tests per person per match being needed, and the possible insensitivity of such a plan when frontline workers in the NHS and other public services are currently not getting the testing they need.\nThese sentiments have now been echoed by Moyes. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to realise there are a lot of people whose lives we could be putting at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen. I think until we have the testing, which we need for the nurses and the doctors \u2013 I\u2019m finding it really difficult to see where the conclusion is and how we can start [to play].\u201d\nThe financial complexities centre on the extension of player contracts. If the season were to return in mid\u2011June \u2013 a best-case scenario \u2013 clubs may have to keep players on large wages who might otherwise have left. Equally some clubs at the bottom would be paying greater wages than they would had they already dropped down a division and activated relegation clauses. It is also the case that some clubs could find themselves in legal dispute with players over extending their deals.\nIf it were judged safe to play and clubs were able to take the short-term financial hit in the hope of recouping the money later through broadcast revenue, for example, there would remain issues over sporting integrity. A compacted remainder of the league season, with 92 fixtures still to be completed, would take place during the summer months and would have a physical impact on players. Clubs with smaller squads would face a challenge.\nOne club is believed to consider their squad\u2019s age profile as a disadvantage if a regular rhythm of weekend-midweek-weekend were required. Another raised the issue of what would happen should a player refuse to play over welfare concerns, or if one who had been set for a transfer were selected against their prospective new club.\nMoyes also raised the issue of compacting next season as a result of extending this one, with the postponed European Championship to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful that we are not asking an incredible amount of the players,\u201d said Moyes, whose team were in 16th place when the season stopped.\nThe issues may be resolvable but it is understood they have not been discussed openly in Premier League meetings. One club official who has been part of the meetings said there had been no attempt to ascertain a \u00adpreferred outcome and none expressed by individual teams. The next Premier League meeting is \u00adscheduled for \u00adFriday 1 May.",

As to how to protect the staff and visitors at casinos and hotels, she said: \u201cThat\u2019s up to them to figure out.\u201d\nThe interview quickly attracted criticism, with one veteran Nevada journalist calling it \u201cthe single most embarrassing thing\u201d he had seen from a state politician in 35 years.\nI have seen many Nevada officials stumble on national TV. But that was the single most embarrassing thing i have seen by a NV pol in 35 years here.

The talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel referred to the interview as \u201cbonkers\u201d and said she \u201cshould resign before lunch arrives today\u201d.\nThe @mayoroflasvegas Carolyn Goodman should resign before lunch arrives today.

The union said 11 of its members so far have died of Covid-19.\nBrian Knudsen, a Las Vegas City councilman, said Goodman \u201cdoes not speak for all of us\u201d, and reopening now \u201cis reckless and completely contrary to the overwhelming consensus of medical experts\u201d, while Dina Titus, a Democratic congresswoman who represents the Las Vegas Strip, said the mayor doesn\u2019t represent the area \u201cliterally or figuratively\u201d and the advice of scientists telling people to stay home should be heeded.\nThe interview adds to the mayor\u2019s previous controversial comments.\n\u201cAssume everybody is a carrier,\u201d Goodman said on Tuesday on MSNBC. \u201cAnd then you start from an even slate. And tell the people what to do. And let the businesses open and competition will destroy that business if, in fact, they become evident that they have disease, they\u2019re closed down. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\nLast week, she referred to sweeping orders to close non-essential businesses as \u201ctotal insanity\u201d, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the city\u2019s response to coronavirus has landed it in the national spotlight.\nIn late March, images of homeless people sleeping in a converted parking lot prompted widespread condemnation after officials turned the outdoors lot into a temporary shelter.\nCity officials at the time said it was the best option available to deal with an \u201cemergency situation\u201d, after another homeless shelter was forced to close.\nLast week, Las Vegas touted a new \u201cisolation and quarantine complex\u201d for homeless people, erected in the same city-owned parking lot. The shelter consists of a series of tents for homeless people who have coronavirus but are not sick enough to go to the hospital.\nGoodman\u2019s comments came a day after public health officials in Nevada reported 119 new cases of Covid-19 and nine additional deaths overnight in Clark county, where Las Vegas is located. Statewide, officials have tallied more than 4,000 coronavirus cases and 172 deaths.\nAcross the county, pockets of resistance have risen to challenge lockdown restrictions, with protesters calling on states to re-open businesses.

There is a global supply problem with stock and the agents that make them in short supply.\n\u201cThe impact is that health leaders and their staff live in fear and uncertainty about what equipment they\u2019ll receive, not helped when we continue to hear of domestic companies offering their support and being ignored, with some then shifting their supplies to other countries,\u201d said Niall Dickson, the organisation\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cOne member told us today that they were expecting a crate of gear, only to receive a single box, leading them to manufacture their own gowns and scrubs. There are millions of shipments but the NHS is following guidance and getting through it rapidly,\u201d Dickson added.",

Research has suggested all the biggest airlines in the UK and many big holiday companies have been systematically breaking the law by denying timely refunds to customers for travel cancelled during the pandemic.\nThe industry in the UK is also fighting for survival and its peak body said the refund rules, if not suspended, would lead to \u201ccatastrophic damage to the UK travel industry and widespread consumer detriment\u201d.\nLast week, Guardian Australia reported that Topdeck, a major youth travel operator, had announced it was changing its refund policy.\nInitially, the company had promised some travellers refunds for cancellations.\nBut the changed policy meant it was now \u201coffering a credit voucher in order to travel with us in the future, which will not be redeemable for cash refunds\u201d.\nOne customer was told: \u201cPlease note: we are not able to process cash refunds \u2013 even if we had previously agreed this.\u201d\nTopdeck said offering travel credit was \u201creasonable\u201d given the circumstances, and in line with ACCC guidance and the industry standard.\n\u201cOur current position is not unique and is in line with many other tour operator and travel companies in the present environment,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\nIntrepid Travel, an adventure tour company, has also recently changed its refund policy and applied it to past bookings. The company denies it did this to deny customers refunds.\nBut many Intrepid customers, either through contact with Guardian Australia or on the company\u2019s Facebook page, say the opposite. Some customers say they were initially promised refunds, then subsequently offered only a credit when the company changed its policy.\n\u201cThis is our offer given the current environment,\u201d one customer, Declan Gallagher, was told. \u201cShould you wish for this to be reviewed further, we ask for you to contact us after the 31st of July, 2020.\u201d\nIntrepid said it was still working with individual customers who had ongoing concerns.\nThe industry says many customers are happy with travel credit. But some customers who have contacted Guardian Australia say credit is useless because the pandemic has left them without jobs, fearful of the health risks of future travel, or concerned their travel provider will go bust.",

        "content": "Roger Federer\u2019s surprise suggestion that the governing bodies who have separately run men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis for decades should merge to steer the game through the global health crisis and beyond has set alight discussion on social media.\nAlthough combining the different ranking systems, schedules and rules of the ATP and the WTA is superficially appealing, considerable political obstacles remain. The existing hierarchies will take some persuading to vote themselves out of high office, for a start, whatever the passing observations of a universally admired legend of the game who has won 20 majors and whose opinion carries probably more weight than that of any other player.\nFederer asked his 12.7m Twitter followers on Wednesday: \u201cJust wondering, am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis to be united and come together as one?\u201d Judy Murray reposted a #strongertogether hashtag in apparent approval of Federer\u2019s remarks. However, Nick Kyrgios responded: \u201cDid anyone ask the majority of the ATP what they think about merging with the WTA and how it is good for us?\u201d\nFederer added: \u201cI am picturing a merger between the WTA and ATP. I am not talking about merging competition on the court, but merging the two governing bodies (ATP and WTA) that oversee the men\u2019s and women\u2019s professional tours. It probably should have happened a long time ago, but maybe now is really the time. These are tough times in every sport and we can come out of this with two weakened bodies or one stronger body.\u201d\nJust wondering\u2026..am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis to be united and come together as one?\nHe replied to one follower who complained that having two strands of governance was confusing and unnecessary. \u201cI agree with you. It\u2019s too confusing for the fans when there are different ranking systems, different logos, different websites, different tournament categories.\u201d\nThe Association of Tennis Professionals, formed in 1972 to represent the interests of male players after the upheaval that followed the arrival of the Open era, has its global headquarters in London, and has morphed into an uneasy alliance of tournament directors and the players\u2019 council, led by the world No 1, Novak Djokovic. The Women\u2019s Tennis Association, inspired by the pioneering work of Billie Jean King and eight other active players, came into existence a year later, with headquarters in Florida. It governs a sport with players in more than 100 countries competing for $146m (\u00a3118m) in prize money, and has parity with the men\u2019s Tour at grand slams.\nMerger is an idea that has been mooted before but has not been seriously discussed by either organisation recently, until the onset of the coronavirus crisis. Last week the ATP\u2019s new chief executive, Andrea Gaudenzi, drew back from agreeing with combining the administrative capacity of both organisations, but agreed closer cooperation was a good idea. \u201cIt is extremely important and I think it is one of our biggest advantages towards our competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do we have a great women\u2019s product, but also our audience is fairly split among women and men.\u201d\nGaudenzi, who reached a career-high No 18 in the world, said the game was most marketable when it had men\u2019s and women\u2019s events in the same tournament. \u201cA combined event, I strongly believe, is a better event both on site and [through the] media. It is just great. The variety is great. Our fans, they love both. We have strong combined tournaments within the ATP and the WTA and the grand slams are combined.\n\u201cIt is really a no-brainer and actually we are lucky to be at the forefront in that regard. Other sports should be looking at what we have done so far. It is really important and it is a huge opportunity because it becomes very appealing content for the broadcasters.\u201d\nFederer, however, wants the game to go a step further: he is speaking the unspoken. Even Chris Kermode, one of the ATP\u2019s most innovative leaders and whom Gaudenzi succeeded in January, did not explore the possibilities of a merger. It is not the first time the subject has been raised. In 2005 the then chief executive of the WTA, Larry Scott, was in favour but he said if it did happen it would not be as the result of a \u201cbig bang\u201d, as John McEnroe and Andrea Agassi proposed at the time.\nScott, who had been No 2 at the ATP, revealed that the outgoing ATP chairman Mark Miles had asked him if he wanted the men\u2019s job. He declined but said: \u201cI told him what I would be interested in is bringing the tours together. I believe that would be a great step for the sport, whether it\u2019s as a joint venture or a complete merger.\u201d\nIt did not happen then and, as one highly placed insider said on Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen now. Way too much politics.\u201d\nAndy Murray, meanwhile, says he is uncertain if a short spell of illness that forced him to self-isolate last month was Covid-19. \u201cI was a little bit sick for two or three days about four weeks ago,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday.\n\u201cSo, before the quarantine started, I was isolating for probably four or five days. Most people I\u2019ve spoken to have had some sort of symptoms and felt a bit sick. But it\u2019s difficult to know whether you have actually had the virus or not. Obviously, the test should be saved for people that are in severe situations and the frontline NHS workers in this country.\u201d\nMurray, still working on his fitness after a groin strain sidelined him five months ago, is pessimistic about the game\u2019s early return. \u201cLet\u2019s say things in Europe have improved, but there are certain countries that might still have issues... in South America, for example, and France was not allowing flights in from South America or certain countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have a tournament, basically, where people or players from a certain continent or countries are not allowed to come in to compete.\n\u201cI think the tournament loses. We\u2019d have to feel as though the whole world is working normally and traveling normally again before tennis can come back, especially the major competitions.\u201d",

US authorities say that while it appears some animals can get the virus from people, there is no indication pets are transmitting it to human beings.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to panic. We don\u2019t want people to be afraid of pets\u201d or to rush to test them en masse, said Dr Casey Barton Behravesh, a CDC official who works on human-animal health connections. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that pets are playing a role in spreading this disease to people.\u201d\nDr Anthony Fauci, the White House\u2019s top medical adviser on the coronavirus outbreak, struck a similar note of caution in Wednesday\u2019s press briefing.\nPets and animals can get infected with the virus, but \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to a human\u201d, Fauci said.\n\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d Fauci added, but right now it seemed unlikely.\nStill, the CDC is recommending that people prevent their pets from interacting with people or animals outside their homes \u2013 by keeping cats indoors and dogs out of dog parks, for instance.\nScientists studying the virus have been looking closely at links between humans and animals. While a consensus is still evolving, the leading theory is that infection among humans began at an animal market in China, probably from an animal that got the virus from a bat.\nThe first of the two New York cats fell ill about a week after a person in its household had a short respiratory illness, though the person\u2019s ailment wasn\u2019t confirmed to be Covid-19, Barton Behravesh said. The animal goes outdoors at times and might have come into contact with an infected person in the area, she said.\nThe second cat\u2019s owner tested positive for Covid-19 before the cat became sick, officials said. Another cat in the same home has not shown any signs of illness.\nThe cats\u2019 symptoms included coughing and slightly runny noses, officials said.\nThe agencies have recommended that any pet owners with Covid-19 avoid petting, snuggling or other contact with their animals as much as possible, including wearing a face covering while caring for them.\nThere have been a handful of reports outside the US of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a dog in Hong Kong. A four-year-old Malayan tiger, named Nadia, at the Bronx Zoo was believed to have the first confirmed coronavirus case in an animal in the US or a tiger anywhere.",

        "content": "Junior doctor Brandon Verdonk runs the Covid-19 clinic at Westmead hospital in western Sydney. The experience has been empowering\n See all the stories in our Postcards from the pandemic series\nAs a junior doctor at Westmead hospital in Sydney, Brandon Verdonk was planning the next stage of his career. In March he was to begin training to become a general practitioner. His father, Robert, had been a GP and had inspired him.\nThe coronavirus pandemic upended everything. GP training was cancelled, so Verdonk, 32, volunteered to oversee the hospital\u2019s Covid-19 testing clinic, which was set up in a hurry in February.\nTwo months on Verdonk is still working 12-hour shifts swabbing the noses and throats of people who suspect they may have contracted Covid-19.\nHe isn\u2019t compelled to work those hours; he wants to. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot of ownership of this clinic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like my baby and I want it to run smoothly.\u201d\nAs a Canadian, Verdonk is far from home. \u201cOn those days when you\u2019re shovelling snow, you have these dreams of Australia,\u201d he says. He completed a science degree in Canada and his medical degree at the University of Sydney. He graduated just three years ago and has just become a permanent resident.\nVerdonk takes the train to work from his share house in the inner city to Westmead, a large public hospital serving western Sydney. He arrives at 7am, checks the clinic is set up, goes through his emails, absorbing any new criteria for testing as well as fresh hotspots he needs to know about. He attends a meeting of senior hospital leaders to talk through any issues arising overnight.\nWestmead treated the first patient with coronavirus in Australia, a passenger who arrived on a flight from Wuhan in China on 23 January. To date, it has had 50 Covid-19 patients, and two people have died.\nIn the early days, Verdonk says, it was hard to get consistency. Casual staff and locums were brought in to help and the advice from public health bodies kept changing because the crisis was moving so fast. There was new research every day, fresh protocols announced, then \u201call of a sudden you needed to change everything\u201d.\nAt first, testing was limited to people who had returned from overseas or had contact with someone who had tested positive to Covid-19. Last week the criteria were broadened in New South Wales to include anyone with even mild flu-like symptoms if they lived in parts of the state considered at risk of community outbreaks. The hotspots included Westmead.\n(Testing has expanded around Australia. In Victoria, anyone with flu-like symptoms can be screened and NSW is expected to further broaden its testing soon.)\nVerdonk has a wry sense of humour. He was expecting some hysteria at the clinic, \u201cthe toilet paper-buying behaviour to carry into clinic behaviour\u201d. But that reaction has been rare. Before testing expanded, some people were upset that they did not meet the criteria. Even now, testing is declined if a person has no symptoms. Verdonk understands the frustration, but says the best advice at this stage is that \u201cthe validity of the swab is really quite low if someone doesn\u2019t have symptoms\u201d.\nTesting isn\u2019t pleasant and he feels for people having the \u201cnovel experience\u201d of a nose swab: \u201cI often say people come to us with a fear of needles and leave with a fear of swabs because we tickle your brain, it feels like.\u201d\nAt its peak, the clinic swabbed 150 people a day. That dropped off for a couple of weeks but spiked again when the criteria widened. Each day people start off at a kiosk manned by nurses. They have their temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and other basic metrics taken and, if they are seriously unwell, are sent to the emergency department for testing and treatment.\nOne by one the rest are ushered into small rooms to be swabbed. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as a PCR test, which detects whether the virus\u2019s genetic material is present. There are techniques to minimise the risk to staff \u2013 doctors and nurses keep a distance and take the sample from the side of the patient, to limit being sprayed by coughs or sneezes.\nAfter each person leaves, surfaces are wiped down and gowns, gloves and goggles discarded. Swabs are sent to a laboratory and results are usually known within a day or two.\nVerdonk tries to keep some balance in his life but it\u2019s difficult. Gyms are closed so he clears his head by going for a run after work. During the morning commute, he phones a sibling or two \u2013 he has two older and two younger brothers living in Canada. He rings his mother, Yvonne, 59, who studied nursing later in life so she could work with her husband.\nVerdonk is the only son to become a doctor. His father died just as he began his medical studies. \u201cHe just loved his job,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd people loved him. He was the type of doctor \u2013 I have to be careful not to get too emotional \u2013 who put that time in \u2026 Seeing the difference he made in people\u2019s lives was inspiring.\u201d\nHe still plans to become a GP one day but there\u2019s no hurry. Overseeing the clinic has given him a renewed respect for hospital leadership, policy, planning and the bigger picture. He will stay as long as he is needed.\n\u201cI have a vested interest in how this clinic runs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou feel like you can make a small difference in this pandemic time and that\u2019s empowering.\u201d\n Postcards from the pandemic looks at how everyday Australians are coping with immense changes coronavirus has brought to their lives. We\u2019d like to hear your story about how you are managing during this crisis. Email: postcards@theguardian.com",

More than 1,450 people have been infected with coronavirus in New Zealand. A total of 16 have died and eight are in hospital.\nEvery media business in New Zealand has taken up the government\u2019s wage subsidy program, which covers a portion of salaries for a 12-week period for workers in struggling industries.\nHowever, the media industry became the third sector after primary health and aviation to receive specific support after a government announcement on Thursday.\n\u201cThis support reflects the essential role media play at this time in delivering access to reliable and up to date news coverage and keeping New Zealanders connected while in lockdown,\u201d communications minister Kris Faafoi said.\n\u201cThere is evidence New Zealanders are turning to trusted news sources in record numbers at this time so it is critical the media is supported to keep doing the great job they have been doing.\u201d\nFaafoi said he chose proposals that \u201cget support out the door as fast as possible\u201d.\nRoughly half of the funding ($21.1m) will go to television and radio broadcasters to cut transmission fees for the next six months.\nContribution costs to government-funded pool \u201cNZ on Air\u201d have also been slashed, while government will also spend up on subscriptions to publications for the 2020/21 financial year in advance.\nFaafoi has also set up a $11.1 m fund for specific targeted assistance.\nThe package was met with widespread derision by the industry which said it was not enough to deter further closures and lay-offs, and print media and magazines had been completely ignored.\nEarlier this month the New Zealand Herald announced it would lay off 200 staff, and those remaining would take a 15% pay-cut for three months. Magazine giant Bauer \u2013 publisher of The Listener and the Women\u2019s Weekly \u2013 closed its doors in early April, firing more than 250 staff without warning, saying covid lockdown restrictions had made its business untenable.\nArdern has previously pledged longer-term reform of the ailing industry, beyond these short-term patch-up measures, but denied Thursday\u2019s package was insufficient.\n\u201cThis is very much focused on something we can do immediately to provide immediate support,\u201d Ardern said.\n\u201cWhat we need to do beyond that is work on some long-term measures.\u201d",

        "content": "While most sports take a wait-and-see approach, the NRL has put a cross in the calendar to resume play. But there are many questions that first need to be answered\nWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. It is a motto ARLC chairman Peter V\u2019landys has seeping through his veins and oozing out of his pores. It is now very much the driving force behind the NRL and its urgency to get the show back on the road.\nWhile most sports are willing to take a wait-and-see approach, the NRL has pursued a relentless drive to resume competition and has now settled on 28 May. Patience is not a virtue V\u2019landys possesses. He is a believer in the old Gough Whitlam aphorism: crash through or crash. He also doesn\u2019t believe in crashing.\nThere are plenty of details still to be sorted though. Here is where we are now.\nWill the NRL start on 28 May?28 May was announced as the intended return date for the NRL, amongst much derision and skepticism when first declared as the goal of the league. But this has been confirmed as the date with Wayne Pearce, who is leading the Project Apollo committee to bring about the game\u2019s return, saying it was \u201cdefinite\u201d the NRL would be back then. The Sydney Morning Herald reported on Thursday, though, that contingencies are in place to start the competition as late as 11 June with New Zealand Warrriors\u2019 ability to enter and then train in Australia the primary issue. Training is set to be given the all-clear from 4 May.\nHow long will the season run? The specifics of the competition and its machinations will not be known until an agreement is reached with the NRL\u2019s broadcast partners, Fox Sports and Nine. All are in negotiations about redoing their deals with an eye to taking advantage of the current situation to reduce their spend on the NRL. One major issue is the length of the season, with Fox Sports pushing for as close to the full schedule as possible while Nine, which has stated previously it does not want the season to go ahead, is advocating for a shortened season so as not to overlap with cricket\u2019s T20 World Cup, to which Nine has broadcast rights. The cancellation of the latter would no doubt shift Nine\u2019s position. One senior club official believes a 20-round competition that would play into November is the most likely scenario.\nWhat will the competition look like?Some certainties have been announced. Competition points from the opening two rounds will remain. The premiership structure will not change to a conference system as was proposed. There will be no back-to-back games at the same venue for the foreseeable future. All matches are likely to be played at Sydney venues ANZ Stadium and Bankwest Stadium to start the season. There will be no crowds to start with and the season is likely to run its course without fans until at least the finals.\nHas the NSW government endorsed the NRL\u2019s return?While Wednesday\u2019s announcement from Pearce was seen as a major step towards a competition restart, the NSW government has not changed its position with a spokesman stating that \u201cpublic health orders do not prohibit the NRL from re-starting\u201d. This is hardly a ringing endorsement of a 28 May return but by the same token the NSW government doesn\u2019t seem likely to prevent big-time rugby league returning if health and safety protocols are successfully administered.\nWhat medical protocols will be in place?The venue edict will be part of a series of strict biosecurity protocols that the NRL is set to enforce to ensure the competition is relaunched and remains ongoing. Contention remains, though, as to what these measures will be and how they will stack up with public orders, with a NSW government spokesman stating that \u201cthe NRL has sought its own health advice\u201d. There will be stadium sanitisation before and after games. While details of what the protocols will entail have not been announced, V\u2019landys stated that \u201cplayer, staff and officials\u2019 health and safety would be the priority and we would base the rules on the advice of experts\u201d. One clear position is that the NRL will work to strictly enforce the protocols to ensure the game remains viable. \u201cThere will be sanctions \u2026 there must be a deterrent because one reckless act will bring down an entire competition,\u201d V\u2019landys said. It has been reported that teams could be deducted competition points while the NRL will send independent spies to clubs to test biosecurity protocols.\nWhat will happen with the Warriors and interstate teams? At this stage, the Warriors have been given exemption to travel from New Zealand but they have not yet been given an exemption to arrive in Australia. The players would be required to undertake a 14-day quarantine but the club and the NRL are exploring an option of sequestering the Warriors at a Lennox Heads training facility that will allow the team to remain quarantined while training. The Warriors will need this to come to fruition if they are to resume training at the same time as the 15 Australian clubs. This has still yet to be approved and it is not yet known which Warriors players will make the journey, knowing they will be apart from their families for an extended period. Pearce stated that all non-NSW clubs would \u201chave to come to camp in NSW\u201d as of Wednesday but that \u201cthe landscape is changing pretty quickly\u201d. The Victorian government has said it would not allow Storm players to train together in the state, meaning they would need to cross the border to do so. The Queensland government was vocal in its opposition to a restart and premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wants clarification from the NRL before giving the green light. It seems unlikely games will be played north of the Tweed. Queensland clubs, however, are working on being able to return after playing games in Sydney.",

The minister has absolute confidence Services Australia will continue to implement appropriate work environments for essential workers during the pandemic.\u201d\nLabor\u2019s spokesman on government services, Bill Shorten, said it was \u201cvery disappointing that there is a pattern of Mr Robert ignoring issues of genuine community concern if they are raised by local Labor MPs\u201d.\n\u201cI just hope his failure to intervene here has not directly caused a much worse public health crisis at the Tuggerah Centrelink call centre,\u201d Shorten said.\nThe exact date of the positive test and the circumstances in which the worker may have contracted Covid-19 have not been made public.\nThe general manager of Services Australia, Hank Jongen, said the safety of staff and customers was the agency\u2019s highest priority.\n\u201cThose staff who may have been in close contact with the affected staff member have been notified and are self-isolating,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe site is open for other staff.\u201d\nJongen said the agency was \u201cactively working with staff at greater risk than others to provide options, like working from home, consistent with medical advice\u201d.\nThe episode comes against the backdrop of increasing demand for the jobseeker payment, formerly known as Newstart.\nScott Morrison, the prime minister, revealed on Tuesday that Services Australia had processed 517,000 jobseeker claims since mid-March.

The passengers travelled across two trips between Sydney and New Zealand, and docked in Sydney on 8 March and 18 March.\nOn Thursday, Verwall told the inquiry that NSW Health officials boarded the ship on 8 March to conduct an assessment, but was surprised they did not do the same on the 18th or 19th. \u201cWe were expecting the same treatment from NSW Health as we received on the 8th,\u201d he said.\nThe manager said he was \u201csurprised we were not screened by NSW Health in the morning [of the 19th]\u201d even though swabs to be tested for Covid-19 had been taken.\n\nCommissioner Bret Walker SC asked Verwall whether he observed any Australian Border Force officers having \u201cany involvement of any kind in the disembarkation\u201d.\n\u201cI do not recall that at all,\u201d Verwall said.\n\u201cYou did not observe any ABF involvement at all?\u201d Walker asked.\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d he said.\nVerwall also told the inquiry on Thursday that the cruise ship had been sailing \u201cin the red zone\u201d of the cruise company\u2019s infectious disease scale for the entirety of the trip between 8 March and 18 March.\nCounsel assisting the inquiry, Richard Beasley SC, told the inquiry that the \u201cinfectious diseases policy of Princess Cruises has levels in green and red. \u201cWhat level were you in when you docked on the 8th of March?\u201d he asked Verwall.\n\u201cWe operated in the red level,\u201d the hotel manager replied.\n\u201cDid the ship retain in that red zone through the voyage of 8th to 18th of March?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nInternal logs from the ship showed that more than 100 passengers had been ill when the ship docked in Sydney on 8 March. 2,700 passengers then boarded the ship that same day for a second cruise, which returned to Sydney on 18 March.\nVerwall told the inquiry that passengers were asked on the 16th and 17th to present to on-board medical staff if they had health issues, \u201cat the request of NSW public health\u201d.\nHe then told the inquiry he did not observe any involvement of the Border Force in disembarkation.\nWalker asked the hotel manager: \u201cDoes it follow then, that there was nothing done to check passports?\n\u201cI saw border patrol force was at the end of the terminal when guests were leaving, but I don\u2019t think that was for guests, it was for crew,\u201d he said.\nHe said he did not have any communication with managers or executives of the cruise ship\u2019s operating company between 18 March and disembarkation on the 19th.\nThe hotel manager also said they instituted an \u201celevated level of hygiene\u201d, and this commenced before the second boatload of passengers boarded on 8 March.\nHe said staff conducted \u201ca complete sanitisation of all public areas and cabins\u201d.\nHowever, he confirmed there were \u201cdancers\u201d and \u201ca nightclub\u201d on the ship and there \u201cwere no social distancing protocols\u201d for those activities, or for the ship\u2019s on-board cinema.\nIn Canberra, the commonwealth chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, told a Senate committee into Covid-19 that he was \u201cnot directly involved\u201d and \u201coperational decisions\u201d were made by state and territory human biosecurity officers.\nHe also said that there were \u201cmistakes made\u201d.\n\u201cIn retrospect there were some decisions that were made that everyone regrets ... Clearly, there were mistakes made. Everyone was doing their best in tricky and tense times. Let\u2019s not blame anybody but wait and see [the outcome of the NSW special commission of inquiry].\u201d\nWalker opened Thursday\u2019s hearing by rejecting claims that the first day of the commission was \u201cconcealed\u201d from the public.\nOn Wednesday, NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay said she had been taken by surprise by the first day of hearings, saying \u201cthe premier hid this fact at her 8am press conference\u201d.\nOn Thursday, Walker released a statement saying the commission started suddenly because witnesses were only confirmed on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe reason for the late notice for the commencement of the hearings and the lack of \u2018fanfare\u2019 about them is that neither I nor any member of the special commission staff knew that the hearings were going to go ahead until late on 21 April 2020,\u201d he said.\nWalker said the commission was totally independent, and there was no \u201cconcealment\u201d from the NSW government.\n\u201cThe decision to convene hearings this week was mine, and mine alone \u2026 None of the matters \u2026 have anything to do with any minister of the NSW government, much less the premier.\n\u201cThere was no concealment,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as summonses were served, there was public announcement of the hearing. Which was held in public, livestreamed, and a transcript of evidence will soon be available.\u201d\nThe inquiry will continue at a later date.",

There is a voice inside my head and it\u2019s not mine. The voice belongs to a song thrush. He began singing at the waxing moon, a couple of days before it was full, and sang until it began to wane. He would start at dawn from the topmost branch of one tree, then move to the topmost branch of another in the afternoon until the moon rose. Each day he did the same and his song followed the same patterns but never exactly: each phrase repeated three or four times, some sharp and yellow as celandines, some soft and blue as violets.\nSong is the wrong word; the thrush laid a promise, a grimoire of magical objects cast into the sky, to bridge sunrise to moonrise, to go silently into woods of the night and then return to the fantastic idea that shook his body and mind each day. There is nothing more urgent than this, nothing that draws joy and pain through the public air until all delight is gone. \u201cBirds are noisy,\u201d says a voice behind the fence. The loudest voice raised against death, that\u2019s his because (not that he needs one). Then he stopped. It was as if the air was exhausted and became too thin to carry him, until the midnight hailstorm.\nThe following morning, the thrush broke radio silence when there was a cool wave through trees and across gardens and fields on which to skim his oratory. Broadcasting in short durations, morning and evening, from different trees, sometimes missing a whole or most of the day, this was no longer the crazy obsessive. This was the voice returned as a bird, louder than blackbirds and robins but a thrush nevertheless, as bright and imperial as a dandelion.",

Experts say such conditions leave them vulnerable to forced labour and debt bondage, which are modern forms of slavery.\n\u201cThe government must redouble its efforts to protect all workers, both the NHS staff who use protective equipment to save lives and the factory workers who supply it,\u201d said Phil Bloomer, the director of the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. \u201cThis means strengthened supply chain checks and the government using its leverage to improve conditions for workers.\u201d\nThe government has been heavily criticised for its failure to provide sufficient personal protective equipment to NHS staff, leaving some doctors and nurses to cobble together their own protective kits.\nMeanwhile the surge in the global demand for rubber medical gloves has left glove factory workers in Malaysia more vulnerable than ever. While most of Malaysia remains in lockdown, glove factories are back to full production, with employees working round the clock to meet demand.\nIn the rush to ramp up production, some glove manufacturers are failing to protect their staff, workers have told the Guardian.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really afraid. The company is not enforcing social distancing. Everyone clocks in using the same thumb print scanner; 45 people travel to work on the same bus. All the workers arrive at the same time so the main entrance becomes very crowded,\u201d said a worker from Nepal.\nThe migrant workers sleep in 24-person dorms, go to work on crowded company buses and stand shoulder to shoulder on 12-hour shifts for six days a week, making social distancing impossible. In return, some earn as little as \u00a37 a day.\n\u201cOur biggest fear is getting infected by local [Malaysian] workers. If they bring the virus in from outside there\u2019s a very high risk that we will get infected,\u201d said another Nepali worker.\nNeill Wilkins, head of the migrant workers programme at the Institute for Human Rights and Business, said the government must ensure that its suppliers prioritise the health and safety of their workforce. \u201cWorkers should be given clear instructions on how to keep safe, adequate PPE should be provided and social distancing practised. Measures should be taken to reduce overcrowding in living and sleeping spaces and to ensure enhanced sanitation,\u201d he said.\nDespite the glove industry\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights, the NHS spent over \u00a375m on rubber gloves in 2018, most of them sourced from Malaysia.\nIn March, the government reportedly bought 88.5m gloves from Supermax, the European arm of a Malaysian firm.\nWorkers employed at Supermax in Malaysia alleged last year that they had to pay high fees in their home countries to secure their jobs, worked up to 30 days without rest and were penalised if they complained. Supermax denied the allegations, saying they operate in accordance with Malaysian law.\nA Guardian investigation in late 2018 into two of the then largest suppliers of medical gloves to the NHS, Top Glove and WRP, found migrant workers who alleged they were subject to forced overtime, withheld wages and passport confiscation. Top Glove and WRP denied the allegations.\nNHS Supply Chain, an organisation that manages the sourcing, delivery and supply of healthcare products for the NHS, said they no longer have contracts with Top Glove and WRP, but would not say if their current suppliers source from these companies, citing commercial sensitivity.\nThere are around 3 to 4 million migrant workers in Malaysia, mostly low-wage workers from Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Indonesia. The majority pay illegal recruitment fees to brokers \u2013 some as high as \u00a34,000 \u2013 to secure their jobs, leaving them deep in debt and effectively trapped.\nThe UK government acknowledged the problem of excessive recruitment fees in its rubber manufacturing supply chains in Malaysia in its first ever modern slavery statement, published in March, saying it had, \u201ccommissioned research into best practice interventions that prevent debt bondage within this industry.\u201d\nThe US government banned the import of gloves from WRP in September, citing evidence of forced labour in its production. The ban was lifted in March after the government said \u201cthe company is no longer producing gloves under forced labour conditions.\u201d\nWorkers\u2019 rights activist Andy Hall says, despite some minor improvements, worker abuse is still widespread in the industry.\nHe said that the British government has known about allegations of forced labour in its rubber gloves and medical device supply chain for many years now, and has been \u201cfar too slow to act\u201d. \u201cIt is not a case of either protecting frontline NHS staff with the gloves they need or protecting workers producing the gloves, but ensuring both are safe,\u201d said Hall.\nA spokesperson for NHS Supply Chain said, \u201cNHS Supply Chain takes all allegations of labour abuses in its supply chain very seriously, and we have a range of contractual arrangements and initiatives in place to try and prevent such situations arising.\u201d",

        "content": "A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak\nThe global death toll from the coronavirus has exceeded 183,000, with the number of cases worldwide at more than 2.6m. The US accounts for more than 842,000 cases and almost 47,000 deaths. The UK has more than 134,000 cases and more than 18,000 deaths.\nRatings agency Fitch says the world is heading for a recession of \u201cunprecedented depth in the post-war period\u201d with global gross domestic product to tumble by 3.9% in 2020. \u201cThis is twice as large as the decline anticipated in our early April GEO [global economic outlook] update and would be twice as severe as the 2009 recession,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s chief economist.\nTrump said he had signed the order halting immigration to the US just before coming into the room to deliver the White House press briefing. He also said he had discouraged Georgia\u2019s governor from reopening. The US president says he told Georgia governor Brian Kemp that he disagreed \u201cvery strongly\u201d with the decision to reopen businesses in the state. \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon,\u201d said the president.\nThe US government will assess whether the WHO is being run the way that it should be, John Barsa, acting administrator of the US agency for international development said on Wednesday, as Australia called for all WHO members should participate in a coronavirus inquiry.\nA Chinese citizen journalist reappears, having gone missing for almost two months after posting videos from Wuhan during the outbreak. Li Zehua claims he was detained by police and forcibly quarantined.\nHe was one of three Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan during some of the worst weeks of the epidemic. He was last seen on 26 February after posting a video in which he was chased by a white SUV and an hours-long livestream that ended when several agents entered his apartment.\nThe two cats are the first confirmed cases of the coronavirus in companion animals in the US, federal officials said on Wednesday. The cats, which had mild respiratory illnesses and are expected to recover, are thought to have contracted the virus from people in their households or neighbourhood. The finding, which comes after positive tests in some tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo, adds to a small number of confirmed cases of the virus in animals worldwide.",

Go on a journey of billions of miles \u2026 from your garden\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nTo begin looking for objects in the heavens, you\u2019ll need to know where north, south, east and west are. Make a note of where the sun rises (east) and sets (west), use Google maps or use the compass on your phone. Now, download a free astronomy app to your phone AND computer. My favourite, for ease of use and features, is Stellarium .\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nOnce the app is installed, set your location. This ensures that, when opened, the app indicates what is in the sky above you \u2013 wherever you live in the world. Stellarium automatically sets the time and date but also has a function that speeds up time, so you can fast forward to night-time and explore the sky from your sofa. It\u2019s even possible to set it to show the sky on the night you were born.\nDecide what you want to search for in the sky (such as star clusters, constellations, planets) and use Stellarium to find them virtually: this will tell you which direction they lie in, and how high up in the sky to look. Sky Map (Android) and Star Walk (iPhone) are free stargazing apps and provide the names of stars, constellations and planets if you point your phone at the sky. Both have a \u201cnight view\u201d or \u201cred light\u201d option, which is useful once your eyes adjust to the dark.\nStargazing from home doesn\u2019t always mean apps and laptops: you can see plenty with binoculars \u2013 even a cheap pair. Sir Patrick Moore recommended 10x50 binoculars for astronomy as a good starting point and I\u2019ve been using a pair of these at Battlesteads Observatory for five years.\nEnsure your eyes are \u201cdark adapted\u201d by turning off lights. Your eyes will start adapting immediately and that will improve over the next 30 minutes. If stargazing from inside through a window, ensure the area is free from clutter, turn off your lights and get comfortable. If in a yard or garden, turn off all the lights on that side of your house and turn off any outside lights too, being careful to make sure there are no trip hazards first. Whether you live in the light-polluted city or are blessed with dark skies you\u2019re ready.\nThe moon is visible day and the night over the course of a month and on 7 May it will be a supermoon \u2013 a little closer to us than normal and appearing around 10% bigger. Look at the moon with your naked eyes and notice the dark and light-grey patches. Light-grey areas are mountainous highlands; the dark grey are long-dried-up lava beds called \u201cseas\u201d because early astronomers took them for actual seas. If you look closely you can see a white circle (where the seven would be if the moon were a clock face) with rays of white pointing out from it. This is Tycho; a crater about as big as East Anglia. If you have any kind of binoculars \u2013 old or even toy ones \u2013 grab them and have a closer look at the moon. You\u2019ll see more detail around the craters and seas but have a look around the edge of the moon, too, and see it\u2019s not a perfect circle. The rough, jagged outline is because of lunar mountain ranges.\nThe phase of the moon changes daily. The phase is how much of the moon is visible from Earth \u2013 full, half and crescent, for example. The line between the light and dark side of the moon is called the terminator. Each night, look closely at the terminator and you\u2019ll see different craters, valleys and mountain ranges as the line slowly moves across the surface.\nIn the evening, Venus is a bright dot in the west. It shines brightly because the thick clouds that shroud it are reflecting sunlight towards us. If you\u2019ve got binoculars to hand, or a small telescope, notice that Venus isn\u2019t a perfect circle either \u2013 it has phases just like the moon.\nIn the east on pre-dawn mornings throughout April and May, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars line up as three incredibly bright colourful dots. They\u2019re all visible with the naked eye, though with binoculars Mars will look salmon pink, Saturn oval-shaped (because of the rings) and you may even see some of Jupiter\u2019s moons.\nOn 4 July after 9.30pm, the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn will all be very close together in the sky, forming a conjunction, which is a rare event.\nConstellations are official patterns of stars, and you\u2019ll be familiar with some names and patterns. During April, Orion will be visible in the west after sunset. Recognisable by the three stars in a row that form his belt, this is one of my favourites because hanging from his belt is a \u201csword\u201d containing another three stars and the middle \u201cstar\u201d is a naked-eye visible nebula where baby stars are being born. Look at this with binoculars and you may spot a blurry smudge that some see as coloured turquoise.\nLook north for the Plough (often called the Big Dipper). The second star on the \u201chandle\u201d of the Plough is a naked-eye double star. Look closely or use binoculars and you\u2019ll be able to see them clearly even with high light pollution.\nOrbiting the Earth, 250 miles up, is the International Space Station (ISS), home to (usually) six astronauts from around the world. You can easily spot it with the naked eye as it flies from west to east. Go to spotthestation.nasa.gov and enter your location to see when it\u2019s due to fly over you.\nAstronomers hate clouds, but from May to July an eerie phenomenon, often mistaken for the aurora borealis, graces our skies. Noctilucent clouds are white/electric blue ice crystal clouds that form only in the summer, 50 miles up at the very edge of space. Sometimes seen about an hour after sunset, or an hour before sunrise, looking north, they are hauntingly beautiful and best observed with the naked eye.\nEven when it\u2019s cloudy you can explore the universe. Here are some useful links:\n Aurora Borealis: liveauroranetwork.com\n ISS Live Stream: ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream+\n Robotic telescope service Slooh does live streams and has a back catalogue of videos to watch on YouTube. For a small fee you can take control of one of its remote telescopes.\nThere are also several live all-sky cameras and telescopes. Some are more reliable than others: allskycam.com; eso.org; telescope.org\n Roy Alexander is director of learning and lead astronomer at Astro Ventures as well as teaching classes and workshops at Battlesteads Observatory",

Minority groups appear to be over-represented among coronavirus deaths by as much as 27%. The Guardian analysis found that of 12,593 patients who died in hospital up to 19 April, 19% were Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) even though these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England. \u201cThere have been health inequalities that have existed in the [BAME] population but what is being reflected in this pandemic is that those inequalities are actually coming out,\u201d said Wasim Hanif, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham. The Labour shadow equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, has called for an independent investigation into the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities.\nThe UK is embarking on a large-scale study of 300,000 people to find out what proportion of the population has already caught and become immune to coronavirus. In the first wave about 25,000 people in England will be invited to take part in testing. It is expected it will be extended to 300,000 people over the next 12 months.\nMore than 232,000 people may have been infected in the first wave of Covid-19 in mainland China, more than four times the official figures, according to a study published in the Lancet by academics at Hong Kong University\u2019s school of public health. China\u2019s national health commission issued seven different case definitions for Covid-19 between 15 January and 3 March, and the Hong Kong study found these changes had a \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on how many infections were officially recorded. \u201cIf the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by 20 February 2020 there would have been 232,000 \u2026 confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55,508 confirmed cases reported,\u201d the study said.\nThe world is on track for a recession of \u201cunprecedented depth in the post-war period\u201d, ratings agency Fitch has said. South Korea saw its worst performance in more than a decade in the first quarter of this year, its central bank has said, with warnings of a bigger impact still to come. Asian stock markets have risen today though, amid a rebound in crude prices and the promise of more government aid to the US economy.\nHere is a quick catch-up and for further developments stay tuned to our live blog.\nThere\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice.\nHunt for night Van man \u2013 Dutch television has aired security footage of how an art thief smashed his way through reinforced glass doors at a museum with a sledgehammer, raced into the building and ran out with a precious Vincent van Gogh painting tucked under his right arm.\nThe thief, who arrived on a motorcycle, stole Van Gogh\u2019s The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884 from the Singer Laren Museum in the early hours of 30 March. Nobody has been arrested in the theft and the painting \u2013 which had been on loan from another Dutch museum, the Groninger \u2013 is still missing. Police are also seeking information about a white van filmed driving past the museum.\nQuestions over Canada shooter alert \u2013 After the shootings in Nova Scotia, Canada that killed at least 22 people, residents have asked why authorities failed to send an emergency alert while a gunman posing as a police officer drove around the province for more than 12 hours. A week before, all residents of the province received a mobile phone alert asking them to remain at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the same was not done after the gunfire began. The death toll is expected to rise still further as 16 crime scenes are investigated. The perpetrator, Gabriel Wortman, had been convicted in 2002 of assault and, as a consequence, sent for counselling and banned from having weapons or explosives for 12 months.\nCopper-bottomed \u2013 A fresh discovery of copper in an area once labelled the richest square mile on Earth has raised the possibility of a revival for one of the UK\u2019s most historic industries. During exploration for lithium in hot underground springs in Cornwall, engineers came instead upon high-grade copper in a previously unmined area. Further drilling will take place to confirm the extent of the discovery in the parish of Gwennap, near Redruth. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting new discovery,\u201d said Richard Williams, the chief executive of Strongbow Exploration, which owns the mineral rights at the site. \u201cIt tells us there are areas of mineralisation that are relatively close to the surface and are potentially mineable. The plan is to get back in there and do some additional drilling to find out how big the zone is.\u201d\nSouth Korea fought back against coronavirus with a quickly deployed strategy of test, trace, contain. Now, as life begins to return to something like normality in Seoul and beyond, other countries are asking what lessons can be learned.\nFor our science podcast, Hannah Devlin speaks to Dr Miraz Rahman about how to find drugs to treat a new disease like Covid-19, and discusses repurposing old medications.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/22-58489-gnl.sci.20200423.ms.cv19_drugs.mp3\nPsychotherapist Gary Greenberg notes the irony that \u201cin a pandemic, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another.

She was the recipient of the National Medal first clasp \u2013 25 years, National Police Service medal and the Victoria Police Service medal fourth clasp \u2013 30 years.\nShe spent a year sailing around the South Pacific on a yacht which she continued to live on for a while when she returned.\nTaylor is survived by her husband and fellow police officer, Stuart Schultz, and their two sons, Nathan and Alexander.\nHumphris became a police officer in 2019, shortly after moving to Melbourne with his partner of four years, Todd.\nPrior to joining Victoria Police he worked as a sports scientist and exercise physiologist.\n\u201cHe enjoyed the food and bar lifestyle of Melbourne and he continued to have a passion for exercise, competing in triathlons and maintaining a high level of fitness,\u201d Victoria Police said in his obituary.\n\u201cHis squad mates said he genuinely wanted to help people, had a great sense of community and genuine empathy for everyone \u2013 victim and offender alike.\u201d\nPrestney graduated from the police academy in November. He had started work in his current posting on Tuesday, the day before the accident.\nHis grandmother, Eliza Anderson, spoke of how proud she was of her grandson for serving in the police force, and how much his family would miss him.\n\u201cWe were so proud of you. God bless Josh. Miss you forever.\u201d\nIn his spare time, Prestney trained for and competed in triathlons, and is survived by his parents, Andrew and Belinda, and his brother, first constable Alex Prestney.\nKing had been with Victoria Police for six years, in a number of stations in and around Melbourne before joining the Nunawading highway patrol in April 2019.\nHe was described by the officer in charge as \u201can older head with a lot of life experience who always made good judgement calls and decisions. He was a terrific bloke.\u201d\nThe 50-year-old is survived by his wife, Sharron Mackenzie, and their three children, William, James and Henry.\nVictoria police and recruits paid tribute to their colleagues with a minute\u2019s silence on Thursday morning.\nFlowers were laid in tribute at the Boroondara police station, near the crash site. The Victoria police commissioner, Graham Ashton, urged people to maintain safe social distancing, and if possible pay tribute online.\nScott Morrison expressed his condolences and thanked Victoria\u2019s police force at a press conference on Thursday.\nThis morning Police and PSO recruits, instructors and staff at the Victoria Police Academy formed up on the parade ground (for a minute\u2019s silence) to pay their respect and honour their fallen friends and colleagues who so tragically died in the line of duty yesterday evening. pic.twitter.com/DKv9P7lI7y\n\u201cYou step up every day, you stand between us and that danger every single day, and we are deeply grateful for your service, deeply grateful for your sacrifice, and to those families who are knowing nothing other than terrible grief today, we stand with you as much as we possibly can.\u201d\nThe mayor of Melbourne, Sally Capp, said flags would be flown at half-mast and the town hall would be illuminated in blue on Thursday night as a sign of respect.\nPolice forces from around Australia and overseas also paid tribute.\nIt was still unclear on Thursday exactly how the crash happened. Ashton said two officers intercepted a Porsche 911 that was reportedly travelling at 140km/h just before 5pm on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe two officers drug-tested the 41-year-old male driver, identified as Richard Pusey. After he allegedly returned a positive result, the officers decided to impound the car, Ashton said. Shortly after the two highway patrol officers were called to assist at the scene, a large refrigerated truck drove into the four officers.\n\u201cIt is still quite early in the investigation to describe exactly the movements of that vehicle,\u201d Ashton said.\n\u201cThe truck itself appears to have moved from one of the traffic lanes in the freeway into the emergency lane and has travelled a short distance in the emergency lane at around about 100km/h and slammed into the rear of the highway patrol vehicle.\u201d\nThe truck driver had a medical episode at the scene and was taken to hospital under police guard. On Thursday morning police executed a search warrant at his Cranbourne property.

        "content": "A gay, white teenager endures the terrors of national service while hiding his sexuality in a drama that\u2019s grimly compelling \u2013 and beautifully tender\nOliver Hermanus delivered a gut punch in 2011 with his powerful film Skoonheid, or Beauty. Now he has directed a fiercely engaged, complex drama of sexual identity and suppressed yearning in apartheid-era South Africa \u2013 a film with a humid intensity. It is also a war movie about a country at war with itself, with its neighbours and with the whole world. Hermanus and his co-writer, Jack Sidey, have adapted the novel by Andr\u00e9 Carl van der Merwe, entitled Moffie \u2013 the (still very much unreclaimed) Afrikaans word for \u201cfaggot\u201d.\nKai Luke Brummer plays Nicholas van der Swart, a white South African teenager in 1981 who has to do two years\u2019 national service. This means grisly basic training and then a terrifying \u201cborder tour\u201d \u2013 young trainees must move upcountry to engage the enemy in a real shooting war. Angola and the Soviet-backed MPLA (immortalised in the Sex Pistols\u2019 Anarchy in the UK) loom on the border of the South West Africa territory \u2013 now Namibia \u2013 and are used as an ever-present bogeyman to keep South Africa\u2019s young white manhood in a permanent state of aggressive paranoid readiness and to provide an ideological anti-communist rationale for apartheid itself. Young van der Swart suppresses his fear at this vicious dehumanising experience and also his own gay sexuality, because \u201cmoffies\u201d are treated as the enemy within and could expect to be beaten and brutalised.\nHermanus creates some grimly compelling scenes as Nicholas arrives at the training camp after a gruesome train journey, during which the young proto-squaddies indulge in racist insults at black men on station platforms. The drill sergeant is a traditional figure here, and Hilton Pelser\u2019s performance as the monstrous Sergeant Brand measures up in sadism and abuse. Hermanus shows how, from the very first, Brand displays his own mysterious enthusiasm for homophobic abuse, screaming into the young men\u2019s flinching faces his sneering questions about their alleged interest in each other\u2019s bodies. In the camp, furtive glances in the showers and lavatories mean more, and the stakes are much higher. The same is true for Nicholas\u2019s emotional connection with fellow trainee, Dylan (Ryan de Villiers).\nNicholas\u2019s family background is what further complicates the dynamic. Despite his soft \u201cEnglish\u201d looks, he has an Afrikaans name, but he has to explain he has taken the surname of his more robust stepfather after what appears to have been his parents\u2019 divorce. His father (whose photograph Nicholas poignantly carries with him to the camp, almost like that of a sweetheart) is a gentle soul who, in an excruciating act of misjudged manliness, has given Nicholas a porn magazine to take to the camp with him. And it is his father who is to be at the centre of an enigmatic, superbly filmed and rather shocking \u201cflashback\u201d scene of Nicholas\u2019s childhood, when he and his family were horribly humiliated at a holiday resort.\nThere is, arguably, a complication with regards to race. The story of a young white man seeing military action in the service of the apartheid regime, finding comradeship with other white men and never for one moment questioning what he is doing might look now like a tragic or pathetic story of naivety. (One of them, Sachs, played by Matthew Vey, offers some limited leftist talk of Mao and Che in a bar.) But, in this context, it is the gay white man, not the black man, who has victim status. Perhaps it is a stretch to find their intersectional common cause.\nAs with Claire Denis in her 1999 film Beau Travail, a reworking of the homoeroticism of Billy Budd in the context of the French Foreign Legion, Hermanus responds directly to the beauty of male bodies. This, too, is a complicated reaction. Most of the time the physicality on display is intimidating and violent, and yet it can also be a swooning epiphany of carefree beauty, more beautiful, in some forbidden and unknowable way, because of the violence.\nWe are accustomed to talk about toxic masculinity \u2013 and of course the masculinity of this film is mostly very toxic. But then, almost like a reflective object being turned a fraction of an inch to catch the light, the masculinity becomes non-toxic; it becomes supercharged with beauty and eroticism and tenderness.\n Moffie is available to stream on Curzon from 24 April.",

        "content": "Despite Egypt\u2019s fears of \u2018hydro hegemony\u2019 and concerns it will worsen water shortages in Sudan, Ethiopia\u2019s controversial dam project is close to fruition\nFrom his office in central Khartoum, Ahmed al-Mufti prepares every day for what he believes is the water war to come.\nThis conviction led Mufti, a prominent human rights lawyer and water expert, to quit the Sudanese delegation that is negotiating Nile water issues with Egypt and Ethiopia.\nHe was angry at Ethiopia\u2019s decision to build the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam (Gerd), a $4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) mega-project on the Blue Nile river that runs from Lake Tana in Ethiopia to meet the White Nile in Khartoum, flowing north into Egypt. The dam project will affect water levels downstream, depending on how fast Ethiopia fills its 74bn cubic metre reservoir.\n\u201cI believe in one, two, 10 \u2026 100 years, this will cause instability in the region. These are the germs of instability, and it will cause a water war,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cIf not under this government then under another, as no population will see itself dying of thirst when they know that there is water very close by. This was my position when I quit, and every day since then I find more evidence that supports this.\u201d\n  Ethiopia is due to begin filling the dam\u2019s reservoir later this year, following a decade of fraught negotiations between the Nile Basin countries. In early April, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, declared that construction would be completed despite the challenges of the pandemic, with the reservoir to be filled during the rainy season that starts in June. \u201cSaving lives is our priority, while second to this we have the Gerd,\u201d he told Ethiopians.\nSudan\u2019s prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, proposed \u201cjoint management\u201d of the dam, which will deplete Sudan\u2019s water from the Blue Nile while potentially providing much-needed cheap electricity in future. Further downstream, however, Egypt has long seen the Gerd as an existential threat that could deprive its 100 million people of the water they need to survive in a changing climate. Some Egyptian officials have even discussed bombing the dam.\nEthiopia and Sudan say the dam\u2019s hydropower is essential for their citizens to develop and thrive.\nMufti fingers prayer beads as he talks: \u201cI believe that within one year of the filling of the dam\u2019s reservoir, shortcomings will start to appear,\u201d he says. \u201cThis dam is endangering rights \u2013 the right to life and the right to work.\u201d\nHe also fears the dam itself risks collapse. \u201cThere will be a shortage of water, and a lack of safety of the dam abrogating [the] human right to life of the Sudanese people.\u201d\nMufti left Sudan\u2019s delegation to the talks in 2010 after Ethiopia declared it would continue building. Now, in addition to his human rights work, he spends his days touring farming communities to warn them of the risks of the Gerd and working on a newsletter that follows dam developments in minute detail. He has written several books on the subject. \u201cThis one is intended as a record, so that when things go wrong I can say the information was there,\u201d he says, pushing a paperback over his large desk. \n  In January, the tense discussions between the three nations came to a head in Washington. US-mediated talks had secured a preliminary agreement between the trio, including an understanding that a staged filling process would be undertaken in the wet season. The three countries also said they needed to reach agreement on the later stages, not least on the thorny issue of how to manage during dry times. Much depends on the Blue Nile, which has been impacted by the changing climate.\n  When Egypt and Sudan returned to Washington to negotiate and sign the final deal in February, Ethiopian negotiators declined to attend, stating that more time was needed to deliberate. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said a final agreement on the dam could take \u201cmonths\u201d to resolve.\n  Ethiopia\u2019s position fuelled an escalating war of words. Egypt accused Addis Ababa of \u201cintent to exercise hydro-hegemony\u201d, raising the issue with the Arab League and Donald Trump. Ethiopia claimed the US president had \u201cinaccurate and inadequate information\u201d about the issue, while Egypt\u2019s foreign minister conducted a Middle East tour to rally support. Egypt has repeatedly tried to win Sudan over to its position on the dam, even taking steps to end a decades-long border dispute.\nSudan hopes the dam will provide cheap electricity, and has long attempted to strike a balance between Egypt and Ethiopia, attending talks in Washington but declining to sign an Arab League statement condemning Ethiopia. Mufti has seen Sudan\u2019s stance as a fool\u2019s errand, pointing to a declaration of principles signed by the three nations in 2015.\n  \u201cWhat this says is that if there is excess, if, then downstream countries like Sudan will get priority to buy it! If!\u201d he says furiously. \u201cNo specific quantity, no prices, nothing \u2013 if! And the potential generation is expected to be 6,000 megawatts when this was written down, but initially engineers are saying production won\u2019t exceed 2,000, so there will never be excess. If there\u2019s an excess, this will be sold at regular prices \u2013 and right now Egypt is giving Sudan electricity.\u201d\nMufti believes that, in the end, regional politics has won, and Sudan has been sold a lie of cheap power. \u201cThis is what has been sold to the Sudanese people \u2013 it\u2019s not true.\u201d\nOn the bank of the Blue Nile, farmer Abdullah Ali points at the river. The water doesn\u2019t cover the riverbed, exposing a wide streak of brown sandy earth. Ali has extended a pump from his dry farmland to catch some of the river water closest to the bank, but soon he will have to extend it much further.\n\u201cThe water level is down \u2013 even today,\u201d he says. He is 65 and has been a farmer for his entire adult life, but this is new. \u201cIt\u2019s never been this bad before. Last year at this time, the water was plentiful.\u201d\nThe Blue Nile offers a terrifying picture of the climate crisis \u2013 not just for Sudan\u2019s water resources but for the entire region. Ali walks over cracked soil as he points at the remaining crops with his cane, his long white robe billowing in the winds.\n As Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia argue over the Nile Basin\u2019s waters, the climate crisis is encroaching. Ali wants the river to sustain his crops, which this year featured much more alfalfa because it can be grown in dry areas. But this meant fewer profits; alfalfa does not generate as much profit as the tomatoes and okra he sells in Khartoum. The lack of water also meant money was needed for a diesel-powered pump for irrigation.\n He knows the exposed riverbed means that communities downstream will experience drought. The water levels were so low, he was convinced that the Ethiopian authorities had begun filling the dam\u2019s reservoir, decreasing the flow to the Blue Nile. \u201cI think the dam is affecting us here,\u201d he says, repeating the fears of other local farmers.\nThe lack of water is already displacing people. \u201cI know farmers who have given up their land and have moved to work with others who can afford pumps,\u201d says Ali, who fears the same fate if he can\u2019t keep up with the increasing costs. \u201cWe have never been tired like this year. With this amount of water, how can I farm? We don\u2019t go to the government for the solution,\u201d he says bitterly.\n Further up the bank, cotton farmer Hassan Khallafallah was proud of this year\u2019s crop, but worried about next year. His fields of cotton rustle in the wind, with fluffy white buds stretching up to the clear blue sky.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried for Sudan,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not affected [by the lack of water], but in future I will be.\u201d He is concerned about the Gerd the progress of which he has followed closely in the news.\nKhallafallah has already noticed shifting weather patterns and lower water levels in the irrigation channels. On the banks of the main channel that supplies water to his fields, he says: \u201cYou see \u2013 there\u2019s less water in the channel. We expect that after April, there just won\u2019t be enough.\u201d\n Khallafallah has been buoyed by Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy, and says he would like to push the government on the issue of water in future. \u201cThis is a problem for the irrigation ministry. I would go to Khartoum to talk to them.\u201d\nYet Sudan\u2019s Gerd negotiator, Salih Hamad Hamid, of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources, is confident the country can handle some loss of water resources while reaping the benefits of cheap hydropower.\n\u201cSudan seeks to secure its water rights and achieve optimal benefit from the shared Blue Nile waters. The Sudanese proposal optimises the power generation from the Gerd \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s objective \u2013 and minimises harm during filling and operation to both downstream countries of Sudan and Egypt,\u201d he said in a statement to the Guardian.\n  Hamid stressed that the countries had \u201cagreed on a filling timetable of seven stages. This can increase or decrease from seven years\u201d, according to drought and water levels, lengthening the timetable if the water levels of the Blue Nile are lower than average.\n  A shared filling timetable is needed because the dam will create a reservoir twice the size of the Hoover Dam\u2019s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, decreasing the flow of the Blue Nile by up to 25% and potentially decreasing the power of Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam.\nWhile the preliminary agreement mentions potential dry periods, there has been extraordinarily little mention of climate change, an undeniable threat to water resources.\nSudanese supporters of the dam say the annual rainy season that helps the Nile flood provides more than enough water. In their eyes, the Blue Nile and Sudan have water to spare, which could be traded for hydro electricity.\n  But studies show that Nile Basin countries will be subject to longer dry periods. Scientists from the American Geophysical Union have warned that, \u201cdespite projected increases in regional precipitation due to climate change, the frequency of hot and dry years is likely to also rise due to warming. These increased hot and dry extremes will stress regional agriculture, and coupled with rapid population growth, they will exacerbate water scarcity across the Upper Nile Basin in the coming decades\u201d.\n  Two of those scientists, Ethan Coffel and Justin Mankin, have sounded the alarm about how people are at risk. \u201cAt present, around 10% of the basin\u2019s population faces chronic water scarcity due to the region\u2019s seasonal aridity and highly unequal distribution of water resources,\u201d they said. Water is already a scarce resource in parts of Darfur and other desertified areas of Sudan, with conflict over the precious resource potentially exacerbated by climate change.\n  They warned that by 2040, up to 35% of those living in the Nile Basin countries could be facing water scarcity. \u201cThat\u2019s more than 80 million people without enough water to function in their daily lives,\u201d they said.\nOn the Fenti Golf course just outside Khartoum, concerns about water resources appear distant. Sprinklers spray the turf, which is surrounded by verdant flower beds, and date palms ring artificial lakes filled with carp and topped off with several fountains.\n\u201cThese are all drains, so any surplus water goes straight into the water table,\u201d says owner Osama Daoud Abdellatif, pointing to a grate in the grass across the 120-acre course. He is Sudan\u2019s most famous tycoon, and he supports the Gerd project.\n As our golf buggy splashes through puddles on the paths around the course, he points to areas earmarked for exclusive housing. Abdellatif declined to say how much water his course uses, insisting the vast majority of water is recycled.\n\u201cLook at the amount of water and the impact of having a green area. I mean, why do people keep forests? This is the lung of the city. Cities would choke up if there were no green areas,\u201d he says.\n But for Ahmed al-Mufti, and the farmers keeping a watchful eye on the ebbing river waters, the threat is one far bigger than Khartoum\u2019s golf courses.\n This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to correct references to the potential impacts of the dam upstream, as the impacts would be experienced downstream; and to correct a mention of Khartoum which should have been of Addis Ababa.",

        "content": "Cricket fans only want good a scorecard to pore over but that seems far away, two weeks into what should be the new season\nThe talk is of misconduct, match-fixing, potential bankruptcies and tour cancellations when after two weeks of blissful sunshine at the start of the season we expected to be discussing Jimmy\u2019s rib, Jofra\u2019s elbow, Jos in the IPL and Joe\u2019s inability to consolidate an innings. (I was thinking of Denly but let\u2019s toss in Root as well for a better headline.)\nThe cricket pages are scarcely recognisable with reports of clandestine meetings at Derby, phone calls from the Mumbai fixers and financial doom and gloom everywhere. Clearly these are important issues, worthy of pursuit, but for cricket fans such topics are a further source of despair. All they want is a good scorecard to pore over.\nEven so it is remarkable that the England and Wales Cricket Board has recommended a new chairman without knowing more about his recent background at the Football League. Ian Watmore, destined to be the ECB\u2019s first salaried chairman, could be an excellent appointment but surely a bit more should have been known about him.\nAn ECB spokesperson offered a standard forward defensive. \u201cIan Watmore was appointed following a rigorous research and selection process led by global executive research firm Odger Berndtson and a dedicated nominations committee.\u201d\nThis response had a familiar ring to it. It was reminiscent of another government minister explaining how they were \u201cfollowing the scientific advice\u201d when confronted with some awkward questions about past shortcomings. Given the current turmoil, an argument about Colin Graves\u2019s successor is the last thing the ECB wants. Nor do the counties, who, like everyone else, are far more concerned with keeping afloat.\nMy guess is that with the circumstances surrounding his departure from the EFL likely to remain an unresolved case with differing opinions, Watmore\u2019s nomination will stand and he may be capable of doing the job well in the most trying of circumstances. But it is not a good look.\nSurrey\u2019s chairman, Richard Thompson, meanwhile, says that \u201cif we lose a county I don\u2019t think it will be a small one\u201d. It will not be Surrey either, who are less dependent on ECB contributions than any county.\nHis assessment is borne out by the situation at Somerset where Gordon Hollins, once of the ECB and now the chief executive at Taunton, has taken over in interesting times. He has hardly met anyone and has been catapulted into crisis management from the start. \u201cI think the most difficult thing I\u2019ve had to do is to tell 67 of our 76 staff that their services are not required at the moment.\u201d\nThis was a financial necessity. The furlough system has become vital to the survival of our counties and the smaller ones can apply it to a higher percentage of their staff. Hollins also mentions a cost that cannot be quantified in pounds. \u201cAttending a cricket match is not like going to a concert,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a social get-together; friendships are built there and it becomes a big part of our supporters\u2019 lives.\u201d\nUncertainty abounds over when professional cricket might resume and, yes, those overseeing this must \u201cfollow the scientific advice\u201d about mass gatherings. Yet alongside the chaos there can also be moments of clarity. One little example came from Moeen Ali in a Q&A with Guardian readers. \u201cIf there was a Test match tomorrow and I got the call, I\u2019d say \u2018yes\u2019\u201a\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all missing cricket right now and coronavirus makes you realise what you love.\u201d\nThe pandemic has changed perspectives and that can apply on a broader scale as the ECB and counties try to plot a way forward.\nJohn Carr and Alan Fordham of the ECB are locked away with their spreadsheets and their hypotheticals and a task which must make scoring runs for Middlesex and Northamptonshire respectively three or four decades ago seem like child\u2019s play.\nThey start by trying to concoct an international schedule and then must attempt to figure out some sort of domestic programme. They have to embrace the concerns of so many people: the scientists, the politicians, the players at home and abroad, the umpires, the members, the gatemen and the Sky TV executives. Oh, and the press corps.\nToo much speculation is pointless at this stage, but there may be no Championship cricket and no Hundred this summer, which could be both a source of despair and rejoicing to cricket lovers.\nIn fact whatever one\u2019s view of the Hundred, it makes sense not to launch it with all the complications: the overseas \u201cstars\u201d may well be reluctant to come and even the ECB recognises that a major priority must be to give some succour to existing cricket fans rather than reaching out to the millions out there it hopes to attract to this funny, complicated old game. Understandably the focus will be to deliver the Blast.\nThere may be no better time to swerve and experiment. Two-match Test series with West Indies and Pakistan could only take place at the end of the summer. Perhaps in exceptional circumstances and with a shortage of time, four-day Tests could be tried.\nIn between them a completely different England side could fulfil ODI fixtures against Australia and Ireland. At domestic level there might be time for a rejuvenated 50-over competition for the counties alongside the Blast with a red ball and white clothing. Why? To offer the fans a full day\u2019s entertainment and to discover if any batsmen can still cope when the red ball moves. The lie may be almost unplayable but we have to make the best of it.",

Audiences will be able to see both actors in each role, as two versions will be shown on consecutive evenings (30 April and 1 May). \u201cThe actors complement each other perfectly rather than provide a contest,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington in his review. \u201cBoyle\u2019s production is a bravura triumph in which Mark Tildesley\u2019s design provides a whole series of visual coups.\u201d\nSimon Godwin\u2019s epic 2018 production of Antony and Cleopatra, handsomely designed by Hildegard Bechtler and starring Fiennes and Okonedo as the tragic lovers, will be streamed on 7 May. Fiennes and Okonedo were named best actor and best actress at the Evening Standard theatre awards for their performances in the show which, like Frankenstein, was a hot ticket at the enormous Olivier theatre. Their co-stars include a metre-long live snake: four constrictors were used throughout the run.\nIn addition to its weekly theatre streams, the National has announced a monthly virtual quiz, featuring questions on sport and history as well as theatre, with stars of stage and screen taking on the role of quizmaster. The first will take place on 27 April with questions asked by Helen Mirren, Lenny Henry, Lesley Manville and Ian McKellen, who has his own regular quiz at his London pub, the Grapes.\nThe National has already streamed three popular productions during the shutdown caused by coronavirus. The riotous comedy One Man, Two Guvnors clocked up more than 2.5m views over the week it was available. It was followed by adaptations of Jane Eyre and Treasure Island. The fourth stream, which takes place on Thursday night, is Twelfth Night starring Tamsin Greig.",

        "content": "In a compelling, fact-based TV movie, Jackman plays a man hiding a secret or two, offering us arguably his most well-rounded work to date\nWhen considering the public image that Hugh Jackman has spent an illustrious three-decade career cultivating, it helps to focus on a red carpet incident from 2013. Jackman\u2019s at the Zurich film festival for the gala screening of Prisoners, where he runs into a familiar face in the press scrum outside the theater.\n\u201cRollo!\u201d Jackman says, his eyes lighting up in recognition; he\u2019s identified Rollo Ross, a Los Angeles-based reporter and Jackman\u2019s former phys-ed student from his days as a stand-in teacher during his gap year at Uppingham school in 1986. After nearly 30 years, Jackman identifies his former pupil and greets him as if they\u2019re old friends, playfully ribbing him about maintaining his standards of physical education. He\u2019s charm incarnate \u2013 too congenial and thoughtful to possibly be real. What human being remembers everyone they\u2019ve ever met?\nIn the superb new HBO movie Bad Education, Hugh Jackman\u2019s character starts to seem like another endearing illusion around the time that he does this exact same thing. Frank Tassone, the superintendent presiding over Long Island\u2019s Roslyn high school and the No 4-ranked district that contains it, gets a drink from a bartender who happens to have once strode Roslyn\u2019s halls. Tassone duly recalls not only the boy\u2019s name, not only that he used to like writing science-fiction stories, but one of the plots dreamed up by his teenaged self.\nExcept this isn\u2019t a scholastic administrator showing his dedication to the job. This is the beginning of a flirtation between the two men, and in a greater sense, the beginning of the end.\nCory Finley\u2019s film tracks Tassone\u2019s downfall, a scam of such hubris, folly and tragedy that it fits snugly in the Greek pantheon. Tassone skimmed millions from the school district budget to maintain a princely lifestyle with a husband unbeknown to everyone, from the co-workers buying his story about a deceased wife to the aforementioned boytoy kept in the dark. The ripped-from-the-headlines true story would be engrossing any way you slice it, but Jackman elevates the facts into a sublime dramatic work.\nThat\u2019s not just because he gives the performance of his career, more studied and specific and fully-formed than we\u2019ve ever seen, but because he brings an abundance of extra-textual baggage. The film confronts head-on the question of \u201cHugh Jackman\u201d, the intuited public perception halfway between the real Jackman and his fictionalized persona of Tassone. The answer to this question, unsurprisingly, is complicated.\nJackman and Tassone excel by carefully maintaining an aura of absolute control. Frank Tassone is the sort of guy who makes the phrase \u201cnot a hair out of place\u201d literal, with his sleek mane so raven-black it just has to be dyed. He\u2019s introduced slugging activated-charcoal smoothies, part of a fitness regimen so obsessive we eventually learn regular facelifts help keep him in tip-top shape. That\u2019s one of the first signs his total composure might be hiding something, as if behind the facade of cufflinks and cologne spritzes there\u2019s only a big nothing. He uses his charisma to keep the world at an arm\u2019s length, letting them see only the version of himself he\u2019d like them to.\nEven before The Greatest Showman made it official, Jackman was a consummate pro of stage and screen. He\u2019s a paragon of excellence, the night-after-night dependability that made him a sensation on Broadway, where a person needs an entertainer\u2019s soul and an athlete\u2019s hustle to get by. Not even years of reprising his star-making Wolverine gig could make him seem rugged; his has always been a clean-cut machismo, polished to a sheen. This quality, combined with Jackman\u2019s tendency to play personal matters close to the vest in interviews, has led some fans to see him as perhaps too perfect to be true. Jackman\u2019s not one of those tell-all A-listers making content out of his privacy; he comes off like a movie star in the old Hollywood tradition, a seeming trick of the light, as much PR team as man.\nAdding another fascinating wrinkle is Tassone\u2019s homosexuality, kept to himself while not strictly closeted. This may be the gentlest and most vulnerable Jackman has ever permitted himself to appear on screen; one scene deals the veteran hoofer his greatest acting challenge by forcing him to be bad at dancing, having followed his younger boyfriend to a club where they at-first-tentatively get close to Moby\u2019s In This World.\nWatching Jackman shed his self-consciousness and allow Tassone to relax for the first time in the film lands with a disarming tenderness, in part because he\u2019s nodding to rumors in our real world. Though he\u2019s been married for years, Jackman still attracts murmurs, and he must have known this when agreeing to take this job. It would be more than a reach to describe the performance as confessional, but it cannot be denied as commentary.\nJackman finds the humanity in someone who\u2019s forced himself to bury his down deep, for the sake of fitting into a rigid template of success. The brutal irony is that Tassone probably could have been openly gay if he wanted to \u2013 even in 2002, Long Island was pretty tolerant \u2013 but he forced himself to match a picture of a superintendent he had in his head. Perhaps not in regard to his sexual orientation, but Jackman has also conducted himself with an unflappable professionalism, fitting himself into a classical mold of movie stardom. As much as it has won him a massive fandom, it\u2019s also rendered him somewhat unknowable to the sort of cinephile curious about the overlap between an actor\u2019s work and self.\nWith his latest and greatest acting feat, however, he\u2019s teased us with a couple of clues as to what happens when someone who\u2019s always \u201con\u201d finally goes off stage.\nBad Education premieres in the US on HBO on 25 April with a UK date to follow soon",

They are also finding more people dead at home. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), delays to testing and stressful situations are taking their toll on these professionals\u2019 physical and mental health.\nHere, four paramedics relate their working conditions as the Covid-19 pandemic rips through the UK.\nI\u2019m attending at least four or five cardiac arrests a week, compared with one or two a week before the pandemic. That\u2019s at least triple the number. My colleagues are experiencing this as well.\nWe were expecting more autonomy to pronounce more people dead at home but that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Our policies for when and how to resuscitate people haven\u2019t changed since before the coronavirus outbreak began. It\u2019s got to the point where, in some cases, we take people to hospital. When we get there, doctors are coming up to the back of the ambulance and pronouncing them dead there. They\u2019re not attempting further resuscitation.\nOn top of this, we don\u2019t have enough PPE. We\u2019ve been arguing for weeks that it\u2019s not safe for us. Some paramedics are refusing to treat patients unless they have the appropriate PPE.\nWe\u2019re all approaching burnout. A lot of us have had holidays cancelled because of the lockdown. I\u2019m absolutely exhausted and I need downtime at home to process it all.\nParamedic, north-west England\nThere\u2019s a high call volume at the moment, and a lot of cardiac arrests. Most of them could be linked to Covid-19.\nOne patient I went to who died was self-isolating along with his family. He was a high-risk patient because he had underlying health conditions and had a temperature and a cough. He hadn\u2019t been tested but it sounded like it was Covid-19. That won\u2019t go down as one of the recorded deaths because they hadn\u2019t been tested.\nAs a healthcare professional, I would recognise certain symptoms getting worse, treat them and take them to hospital. When people are at home and isolated, we\u2019re getting to them too late.\nFor someone with diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) it wouldn\u2019t take much to tip them over the edge. It\u2019s quite scary. There are lots more deaths out there that aren\u2019t being counted.\nThere is a lack of PPE. Some days you can go and get it, other days we\u2019re having to beg for it. Sometimes you haven\u2019t got it. If you\u2019re two minutes away from someone who is arresting with no PPE, you can\u2019t attend. Another ambulance has to be sent. We\u2019re put in the position of do we leave it, or go in and put our families at risk?\nWe shouldn\u2019t have to make those decisions. It seems very inhumane.\nParamedic, east England\nIt feels like 75% of the jobs we go to are coronavirus-related. The service has cut paramedics and increased ambulances. Instead of having two paramedics on an ambulance, you have one and a firefighter or a volunteer to drive the vehicle.\nWe are going to more people that we are pronouncing dead. We\u2019d average one a week normally, but a week ago I was doing three or four a day. A few weeks ago, my small team saw nine people in a day die at home. Pre-coronavirus, that would never have happened.\nWhen a call comes in from the public we just get told someone\u2019s not breathing. When we get there, we need to put PPE on. It\u2019s stressful. These are the kinds of jobs where we want to \u2013 and the public expects us to \u2013 run in like superheroes, but we can\u2019t.\nMy impression is that people are getting a lot more unwell in a short period. We\u2019re seeing a lot of people who have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Everything seemed all right and suddenly they got a lot worse. There\u2019s no way of predicting that.\nPolicy and procedure in ambulance services is changing all the time. At one point, we were told if we were going to a potential coronavirus patient, we\u2019d have to fill out loads of contact tracing forms. Two days later, that got binned.\nIn the early days of the outbreak, we didn\u2019t have many masks and ambulances couldn\u2019t be dispatched because they didn\u2019t have one between them. We have enough now, but the plastic our aprons are made of is about the thickness of cling film and doesn\u2019t cover our whole body.\nParamedic, London\nIf we don\u2019t think someone\u2019s sick enough to go into hospital we leave them because if someone\u2019s got a respiratory condition, like COPD, and they go into A&E where they can potentially contract coronavirus, there\u2019s another life gone.\nUsually I would see two cardiac arrests a week. Now it\u2019s up to three. I don\u2019t think coronavirus is going to hit us here as badly as places like London and Manchester because we are so spread out.\nI had one job last week where the person was dead on arrival. I don\u2019t know whether it was coronavirus; I don\u2019t have a testing facility on me but you sort of presume that someone with respiratory problems had contracted it and that\u2019s what killed them. When you go out to people who are dead on arrival and the partner is there you think, \u201cAre they going to die now?\u201d\nParamedic, Northern Ireland",

        "content": "Artistic director says theatre sector is in \u2018premier league of risk\u2019 caused by Covid-19 and calls on increased government support for freelancers\nRufus Norris has warned that the UK\u2019s theatre industry is facing potential devastation as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown, that the National Theatre is \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d money and that some venues are days away from breaking point.\nNorris, the National\u2019s artistic director and joint chief executive, told the Guardian he was seriously worried about the future of Britain\u2019s theatres and regarded the industry to be in the \u201cpremiere league of risk\u201d because of its dependency on mass indoor gatherings. \u201cI\u2019m a natural optimist and I\u2019m concerned because I don\u2019t feel optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless there is a real and concerted drive to uphold the cultural industries in this country, it will be devastating. There is no point pretending otherwise.\u201d\nHe called for government investment to avert disaster. \u201cMy biggest worry is about survival. I know several theatres that have days, not weeks. If the furlough scheme doesn\u2019t continue, yet we stay closed as an industry, then it\u2019s very hard to imagine how the sector will survive. I would like the government to increase and broaden the support of freelance artists who are suffering very badly.\u201d\nNorris, who has been ill \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t go to hospital but I felt pretty terrible for a couple of weeks\u201d \u2013 said that while the health of the country was paramount, the creative sector must not be sidelined in the midst of this crisis. \u201cThere are many calls being made on government at the moment and the most important ones are for saving and protecting lives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut two months ago we had a \u00a3110bn creative industries sector, including TV, film, dance and theatre, and it was the fastest-growing sector in the UK.\n\u201cWe can genuinely claim to be world class. We contribute to GDP and the reputation of the country. That needs to be remembered as this wears on. The damage that will be done if we are not supported in this time is impossible to make up.\u201d\nNorris, who renewed his five-year contract at the National just months before lockdown, said the theatre had already furloughed 85-90% of its workforce and that this figure was still \u201cevolving\u201d.\nHe is \u201cmassively worried\u201d about his theatre\u2019s finances. \u201cThe National has a turnover of \u00a3100m a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt costs an awful lot of money for every day we are shut. No one knows when we can open again or when we can get back to a stable situation in which audiences feel confident inside auditoriums.\u201d\nThere are \u201cmonths\u201d of reserve funds remaining in the theatre\u2019s coffers, he added, which they are trying to make stretch to a year \u2013 \u201cbut when we have run out of reserves then what\u2019s next is called insolvency.\u201d\nNot all of the theatre\u2019s planned projects are still slated and although \u201conly a handful\u201d have been taken off the timetable, some of the decisions have come down to expense. Production budgets have been halved and there have been cuts to capital expenditure. \u201cIt\u2019s really serious,\u201d Norris went on. \u201cWe\u2019re cutting everything as long as it doesn\u2019t mean someone\u2019s job.\u201d\nThe theatre had planned to open Richard Bean and Oliver Chris\u2019s Jack Absolute Flies Again next week; it was halfway through rehearsals when the theatre\u2019s closure was announced on 16 March. The show\u2019s set is fully built and docked, ready for use. \u201cI think its subject matter will be very resonant \u2013 it\u2019s set during the Battle of Britain \u2013 so I hope to reopen with it,\u201d said Norris. Other shows such as Kate Tempest\u2019s reworking of Philoctetes, Paradise, which was due to be staged in July, may be moved back significantly.\nNorris hopes that theatres will be able to open by June or July, \u201cbut if we do not open this year \u2013 and we are planning each way as much as we can \u2013 it\u2019s my job to ensure that the theatre survives this\u201d.\nNorris said he felt frustration at the uncertain way that the closure of theatres was initially handled by the government: \u201cI think this government does want to support and help and rebuild, but at the time I felt like it was a deliberate act not to take responsibility. In hindsight it was just clumsy, but it does leave you wary.\u201d\nShortly after closure, Norris wrote about connecting with industry peers and putting competition aside. Theatres have continued to give each other support, he said, with the 13 largest regional theatres in daily contact with each other. He has had conversations with the producer Sonia Friedman and Bristol Old Vic\u2019s artistic director Tom Morris this week, as well as keeping in regular contact with artistic directors including Rachel O\u2019Riordan at Lyric Hammersmith, Rupert Goold at the Almeida and Indhu Rubasingham at the Kiln.\nThe National has launched a streaming scheme, offering some of its shows for free online viewing, which has had an astonishing degree of success, with more than 4m views across three productions. Norris sees this as confirmation that culture has a useful role to play in a time of high anxiety: \u201cIf people are very stressed, maybe it offers a balm and a relief.\u201d\nThe programme started with One Man, Two Guvnors, starring James Corden, and it is set to stream Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, next week. But while Norris was heartened by the uptake, it is not an economically sustainable model for the medium; filming live productions is expensive and all the artists involved agreed to share their work for free, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a surge of creativity,\u201d he said of the current lockdown. \u201cHistorically it has been the case. It is Shakespeare\u2019s birthday on 23 April; he wrote King Lear during the plague and afterwards in the restoration period there was explosion of energy.\u201d\nNorris added that Laurence Olivier, founding director of the National, might also have argued that the theatre\u2019s formation came from a comparable situation, in the wake of the second world war: \u201cGovernment encouraged theatres to put on serious works and not just entertainment.\u201d",

        "content": "This year\u2019s top prospects will be selected remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We assess the best young players coming out of college\nPick: Joe Burrow, quarterback, LSU. The Bengals have to take Burrow. He has the potential to lead them for the next 15 years and to finally get Cincinnati that playoff win Andy Dalton failed to provide. Burrow excelled in his final year at LSU leading the Tigers to an undefeated college championship. Burrow completed 76.3% of his passes for 5,671 yards, 60 touchdowns and six interceptions. Free agency showed a new era may be dawning in Cincinnati and Burrow is the man to make it concrete.\nPick: Chase Young, edge rusher, Ohio State. Washington have a no-brainer of their own in Young. Ron Rivera can build a strong defensive identity with a player following in the footsteps of premium Ohio State edge defenders, Joey and Nick Bosa. A 6ft 5in wrecking-ball whose tremendous speed off the line allowed him to rack up 16.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for a loss and seven forced fumbles across 12 games in 2019. Tua Tagovailoa could be an upgrade on Dwayne Haskins but the inability to assess the quarterback\u2019s fitness up close makes Young the sensible pick.\nPick: Jeffrey Okudah, cornerback, Ohio State. The Lions need a replacement for Darius Slay after trading him to Philadelphia. Okudah can slip straight into Slay\u2019s role as Detroit\u2019s leader in the backfield and make an impact as the best shutdown corner entering the league.\nPick: Jedrick Wills, offensive tackle, Alabama. Offensive line is a must-upgrade for the Giants. Wills, Mekhi Becton and Tristan Wirfs all would do exactly that for head coach, Joe Judge, but Wills makes sense as Judge was once Nick Saban\u2019s assistant in Alabama. Familiarity tips the scales in Wills\u2019s favour without the ability to meet with prospects this year owing to lockdown.\nPick: Justin Herbert, quarterback, Oregon. The Dolphins can pick from the best of the rest with Burrow off the board. Herbert gets the nod over Tagovailoa due to the latter\u2019s fitness problems. His 6ft 6in frame and huge arm pass the eye test. Three rushing touchdowns against Wisconsin in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory showed he can shift when needed too.\nPick: Tua Tagovailoa, quarterback, Alabama. The Chargers need some pop on their offense and Alabama\u2019s QB offers just that. The talent is there - Tagovailoa was on course for a monster season before a dislocated hip cut it to nine games. And Tyrod Taylor can start the season if Tagovailoa requires extra time to prepare. The Chargers\u2019 intimidating defense needs an offense to match.\nPick: Isaiah Simmons, linebacker, Clemson. Matt Rhule\u2019s first pick as Carolina head coach is made easy by the highly versatile Simmons\u2019 availability. Rhule has emphasised his preference for speed so Simmons is perfect. The Panthers are handily just a short trip into North Carolina from Clemson.\nPick: Derrick Brown, defensive tackle, Auburn. Wide receiver was the problem area for Kliff Kingsbury before the Houston head coach, Bill O\u2019Brien, gifted DeAndre Hopkins to the Cardinals. Brown would tie in well with general manager Steve Keim\u2019s additions of linebacker Devon Kennard and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips. Brown is a great player with immense power behind his 326lb frame to disrupt an offense.\nPick: Javon Kinlaw, defensive tackle, South Carolina. Jacksonville\u2019s once-great defense is in tatters across the board but tackle is a glaring hole that needs filling. Kinlaw is the next man up from Brown. His combination of imposing size, raw power and quickness make him an immediate starter for the Jaguars.\nPick: Tristan Wirfs, offensive tackle, Iowa. Wirfs is a good fit for the Browns coach, Kevin Stefanski, whose zone-blocking scheme matches with Iowa\u2019s system. Wirfs is a superb athlete who blew the field away at the combine with an OT record 36.5in vertical jump, a 10ft 1in broad jump that tied the record and a class-topping 40 time of 4.85sec.\nPick: Mekhi Becton, offensive tackle, Louisville. Sam Darnold needs protection and Becton can make an instant impact for both the passing game and by creating running room for Le\u2019Veon Bell. He tips the scales at 364lb but has quickness despite his gigantic 6ft 7in frame.\nPick: CeeDee Lamb, wide receiver, Oklahoma. The cream of a highly-talented crop of receivers. Lamb has drawn comparisons to DeAndre Hopkins due to his ability to make contested catches. His impressive speed and strength after the catch shows he has a path to becoming a better player than Hopkins.\nPick: Henry Ruggs, wide receiver, Alabama. Ruggs could provide another dimension to Kyle Shanahan\u2019s offense in 2020. A blistering 40 time of 4.27sec, the third best ever at the Combine, could be the perfect complement to Deebo Samuel\u2019s versatility. Hands you can trust with five passes dropped in three seasons at Alabama.\nPick: Andrew Thomas, offensive tackle, Georgia. Tom Brady will be 43 when the season (hopefully) starts in September. The Bucs must keep him standing at all costs. Thomas is the best available lineman to let Brady remind Bill Belichick what he\u2019s missing.\nPick: Jerry Jeudy, wide receiver, Alabama. Denver need a receiver to partner Courtland Sutton, so Jeudy is the pick. He\u2019s so good at shedding coverage that \u201cto Jeudy\u201d has become a verb around his home of south Florida.\nPick: AJ Epenesa, edge rusher, Iowa. Atlanta have beefed up their offense, so logic dictates the Falcons going the opposite way in the draft. Epenesa is a premium edge rusher who can help solidify Dan Quinn\u2019s frontline.\nPick: K\u2019Lavon Chaisson, edge rusher, LSU. Chaisson can fill the void left by Robert Quinn on the edge and form a formidable pass-rushing partnership with DeMarcus Lawrence. The line as a whole starts to look a little scary with Gerald McCoy and Dontari Poe in the mix.\nPick: Austin Jackson, offensive tackle, USC. The Dolphins need help to protect their shiny new quarterback. Jackson, at just 20, is a long-term project who can grow with Herbert and allow the quarterback to play with more time than Ryan Fitzpatrick was allowed last season.\nPick: CJ Henderson, cornerback, Florida. After adding a receiver earlier in the first-round, the Raiders\u2019 thoughts should turn to the formidable passing attacks in the AFC West. Eli Apple\u2019s deal may have gone awry but Henderson\u2019s athleticism can be a building block to a solid secondary.\nPick: AJ Terrell, cornerback, Clemson. Jacksonville\u2019s defensive rebuild continues with Terrell in the backfield. A tough, fast corner to begin the project of replacing Jalen Ramsey and AJ Bouye.\nPick: Justin Jefferson, wide receiver, LSU. Alshon Jeffrey can\u2019t stay healthy while Nelson Agholor has deserted to Las Vegas. The Eagles select Jefferson, adding a receiver with pace to burn and great hands.\nPick: Kristian Fulton, cornerback, LSU. The departure of Xavier Rhodes, Trae Waynes, and Mackensie Alexander mean the Vikings have to work on their secondary. Fulton, drawing comparisons to All-Pro Tre\u2019Davious White, should be an immediate starter.\nPick: Kenneth Murray, linebacker, Oklahoma. The pick everyone is waiting for. Jordan Love? Nope. The Pats go after Murray and get a playmaker in the spine of their defense who is versatile, fast and a future leader for Belichick.\nPick: Patrick Queen, linebacker, LSU. New Orleans have one of the strongest rosters so they can pick up the best player still on the board, Queen. A strong, imposing defender who will instantly strengthen their linebacker unit.\nPick: Tee Higgins, Clemson, wide receiver. Much like their previous pick, the Vikings need to repair holes left in free agency. Stefon Diggs is out the door and passing him on the way in is Higgins. At 6ft 4in he would be an excellent weapon for Kirk Cousins on the outside and in the redzone.\nPick: Denzel Mims, wide receiver, Baylor. Miami jump on the receiver train to continue bolstering their offense and join up with DeVante Parker. Mims has an impressive highlight reel of acrobatic catches at Baylor.\nPick: Yetur Gross-Matos, edge rusher, Penn State. Jadeveon Clowney appears not be re-signing in Seattle so they need someone new who can get to the quarterback. Gross-Matos recorded 9.5 sacks in 2019 and fits with Pete Carroll\u2019s defensive philosophy.\nPick: Cesar Ruiz, center, Michigan. Ruiz can play across the interior line positions so chimes with Baltimore\u2019s penchant for versatile players. Ruiz might struggle to fill Marshal Yanda\u2019s shoes but the Ravens still have to find a way to maintain their explosive offense this season.\nPick: Jaylon Johnson, cornerback, Utah. Johnson can fill a void in the slot for Tennessee while providing depth to defend against the pass.\nPick: Jordan Love, quarterback, Utah State. Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers to Love. Rodgers may not be finished but Green Bay have nothing in reserve, yet. Love can learn from the best until it\u2019s time to take on the mantle.\nPick: Ross Blacklock, defensive tackle, TCU. Blacklock showed he can pass rush from the inside in college using speed from the snap to get to the quarterback. May not replace DeForest Buckner but the Niners need help on their d-line.\nPick: Jeremy Chinn, safety, Southern Illinois. Running back is tempting for the Super Bowl champions but the smart move would be an upgrade to their defense. Chinn and Tyrann Mathieu could become an imposing tandem at safety.\n1) Clyde Edwards-Helaire, running back, LSU. On film Edwards-Helaire looks like a raw Mark Ingram, creative at finding room and an excellent catcher out of the backfield.\n2) Jacob Eason, quarterback, Washington. New England and Indianapolis are rumoured to be interested in the 6ft 6in passer.\n3) Cole Kmet, tight end, Notre Dame. If a team want a giant receiver who can burst through tackles then Kmet is their guy.",

In 2018, daughter Jade had become a beauty influencer on Instagram; her profile assumed a new dimension when she started documenting the way her dad, Anthony, a former boxer, was dealing with his prostate cancer.\nThings became even more complex when Jade was diagnosed with sarcoma, and she began talking in the same artless way about that. Connors intersperses his own black-and-white footage of Jade and Anthony (and her mum, Kim, and brother, Eoin) with Jade\u2019s own Instagram videos, which are shot portrait-style, often in her car, with text and wacky emojis.\nWe can see how the Panglossian self-promotional rhetoric of social media, with its habitual filtering and airbrushing, is coming into contact with something darker and more unmanageable. Often, Connors will include updates about the way Jade\u2019s follower count is fluctuating \u2013 perhaps because the public was unsure how to take what she was telling them.\nIt\u2019s a touching film, precisely because it has a rough-and-ready, homemade quality. Jade is no more of a narcissist than anyone else on social media, and there is a heartrending openness about what she is trying to do. If there is a fault in this film, it is that it does not analyse clearly enough what it means to go through such a tough experience in the real time of social media. Specifically, it could have been more candid about what type of trolling Jade had to withstand \u2013 that was clearly an issue \u2013 and how she reacted to what appear to have been shifts in public opinion. But there is something affecting in the simplicity of this film, which has a sadness and sweetness.\n Endless Sunshine on a Cloudy Day is available to stream on Vimeo.",

The Australian Health Protection Principle committee has also been asked to consider allowing community sport and reopening more retail shops.\nBut Murphy warned Australia would be at \u201cpermanent risk of further waves\u201d of infection and international travel will be banned for at least another four months.\nHe acknowledged that some states had implemented restrictions differently \u201cat the margins\u201d but he would be \u201cconcerned if there are major changes in one state\u201d without national cabinet agreement.\nAsked about the contact tracing app under development, Edwards reiterated that downloading it will be voluntary and no geolocation data will be stored.\nEdwards told the hearing when users download the app they give only their name, age range and postcode. They are then assigned a unique identifier. The app works by swapping unique identifiers with another user who is within 1.5 metres for a period of 15 minutes or more, she said, and all information is encrypted and stored on the phone.\nInformation will sit on the phone \u201cnever used\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t go anywhere at all\u201d, until it is destroyed when the app is deleted, Edwards said, or a person contracts Covid-19 in which case it will be accessed in an unencrypted form by public health officials.\nEarlier, Coatsworth said this operated as a two-step consent, as users would have to choose both to download the app and then later to release its data.\nEdwards said the purpose of the app is \u201csolely to assist in the public health response, particularly the contact tracing processes that states and territories already do\u201d and data would be not be used for compliance, enforcement or any other purpose.\nEdwards said she was aware that legislation governing the use of the app was one option being considered, but it could be implemented through agreements with the states and territories about how they use data and \u201cbiosecurity declarations\u201d.\nEdwards said legislation or biosecurity declarations could prevent data being obtained with a warrant or under a subpoena, and the department was \u201calive to the issue\u201d of preventing it being admitted to court.\nAustralia\u2019s biosecurity laws allow the health minister to \u201cdetermine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary\u201d to prevent entry or spread of a disease, subject to safeguards including that orders are \u201cappropriate and adapted\u201d to their purpose.\nEdwards said the app requires Bluetooth to be enabled to work, and currently works \u201cbetter on Android\u201d than iPhones although \u201cboth are working\u201d and performance is improving on both systems.\n\u201cI think 40% would be great take-up, we\u2019d like 90% [take-up] or more,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe more who do take it up the better. We haven\u2019t got a particular number in mind.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy if 20% do, I\u2019ll be happier if 40% do, I\u2019ll be even happier if 80% do because it will give more data to our health officials.\u201d\nAsked about Hunt\u2019s goal of 40%, Edwards replied she is \u201cnot aware of the basis of that number\u201d.\nOn Thursday, the attorney general Christian Porter told Guardian Australia that \u201cspecific regulatory action will be taken to prevent such access for law enforcement agencies at both the commonwealth and state/territory level\u201d.\n\u201cThe government has already made the decision not to make any information collected by the app available for other purposes, including law enforcement investigations,\u201d he said.",

Scott Benton, the Conservative MP for Blackpool South, has added his signature.

Campbell, a Rangers fan, told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ve been following this story for over a week as I take a keen interest in Scottish football. Given the extent and range of the allegations with claim and counterclaim I believe this requires a completely independent investigation to clear up the mess and hopefully restore a degree of integrity into the administration of the game.\n\u201cThe scale of monies involved and the reputational damage is considerable, which is why I believe pressure must be brought to bear on senior football administrators in Scotland to establish such an inquiry immediately. Having spoken to some other MPs I hope to have cross-party support for the motion in the next few days.\u201d\nThe SPFL chairman, Murdoch MacLennan, has said: \u201cI am entirely satisfied, based on all the information at my disposal, that the SPFL and its executives and legal advisers have acted wholly properly at every stage in this process.\u201d",

        "content": "Sussan Ley says work is already under way to speed up environmental assessments of projects\nThe environment minister, Sussan Ley, has flagged the government may change Australia\u2019s national environment laws before a review is finished later this year.\nLey said she would introduce \u201cearly pieces of legislation\u201d to parliament if she could to \u201creally get moving with reforming and revitalising one of our signature pieces of environmental legislation\u201d.\nIt follows business groups and the government emphasising the need to cut red tape as part of the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis, and comes as the businessman Graeme Samuel chairs an independent statutory review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. An interim report is due in June, followed by a final report in October.\nWhen the review was announced, the government said it would be used to \u201ctackle green tape\u201d and speed up project approvals.\nEnvironmental organisations have stressed the need for tougher environmental protections to stem Australia\u2019s high rate of extinction. Australia has lost more than 50 animal and 60 plant species in the past 200 years and recorded the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world over that period.\nLey said, with the interim report due by the middle of the year, she expected Samuel would \u201cin the course of the review, identify a range of measures that we can take to prevent unnecessary delays and improve environmental standards\u201d.\n\u201cWhere there are opportunities to make sensible changes ahead of the final EPBC review report, I will be prepared to do so,\u201d she said.\nOn Thursday, Ley and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said work was already under way to speed up environmental assessments of projects and that the number of on time \u201ckey decisions\u201d in the EPBC process had improved from 19% in the December quarter to 87% in the March quarter.\nAn environment department spokesman said key decisions covered three items in the assessment process: the decision on whether a project requires assessment under the act, the decision on what assessment method will be used, and the final decision on whether or not to approve the project.\n\u201cFor the December quarter 2019, the Department met 19% of the 80 key decisions due that quarter. This increased to meeting the statutory timeframes for 87% of the 61 key decisions due in the March quarter 2020,\u201d he said.\nThe environment department also publishes annual data on the percentage of EPBC-related decisions that are made on time. This data covers several types of decisions in the assessment process, not just the final approval of a project.\nIn the 2018-19 financial year, 60% of decisions were made on time.\nBut it is not just project assessments that are subject to delays. Species assessments and recovery planning timeframes have also become longer in recent years.\nBrendan Sydes, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Australia, said there was nothing preventing the government from making changes to the act before the review was complete. But he said it would be \u201ca bit strange to act on draft recommendations rather than the final report\u201d.\n\u201cClearly the draft will be the first opportunity people have to scrutinise or see what the Samuel review is likely to recommend,\u201d Sydes said.\nHe said the review was about more than just streamlining the act and there were other important priorities, including improving protections for threatened species.\n\u201cIt really ought to be treated as a comprehensive package of reform if there are to be reforms after the review,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo one opposes the act being as efficient and effective as possible but we really need to have a focus on the objectives the act is attempting to achieve, rather than streamlining and processes.\u201d\nDavid Morris, the chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office, said there could be instances where it was sensible to propose legislative changes before the review was complete, but it would depend on what was being proposed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re supportive of sensible changes to legislation,\u201d he said.\nBut he added the government \u201cwould want to avoid any perception that they were making poor environmental decisions and then fast-tracking those at a time when people are distracted by a major pandemic\u201d.\nAmelia Young, the national campaigns director for The Wilderness Society, warned against the idea that cutting environmental protections could act as an economic stimulus measure once Covid-19 restrictions are eased.\n\u201cWeaker environmental protections and fast-tracked infrastructure approvals are not part of a safe and positive future for Australia as we recover from the coronavirus challenge,\u201d she said.\nYoung said many Coalition MPs had shown concern over the suffering and loss of wildlife during the bushfire season and were aware of heightened environmental concern in the community.\n\u201cMany government MPs met with our local membership groups and discussed the issue at length. These MPs well know that there is huge community support towards better protecting Australia\u2019s natural environment,\u201d she said.",

South Africa, No 1 in the world now and vying with New Zealand for supremacy then, returned home after four torrid months in Britain and Ireland when they were dogged by anti-apartheid protests and failed to win any of their four Tests.\nIt was a rude awakening for the vast majority of the squad who had little experience of the world outside their homeland, their isolation fostered by the lack of television in the country.\nEurope was emerging into the world of colour at the end of the 1960s, but black and white in South Africa amounted to a political system that was abhorrent in a world that knew the power of protests.\nThe Springboks, as Chris Schoeman shows in his book on the tour, Rugby Behind Barbed Wire (Amberley, \u00a320), were innocents abroad. There were exceptions, such as South Africa\u2019s vice-captain Tommy Bedford, who studied at Oxford University and warned at the official reception on the eve of the squad\u2019s departure that what lay ahead would probably be reflected in results.\n\u201cIf we did not win all our games or even lost Test matches because none of us would have had any idea of how to cope with this additional demonstration phenomenon, the people back home and those in the comfort of the function room should remember this,\u201d he told Schoeman. \u201cThat went down like a lead balloon.\u201d A later speaker implied that Bedford was being disloyal.\nFifty years on, Bedford lives in London. He was so changed by the tour \u2013 identifying with the aims of the protestors to undermine apartheid through sporting isolation, if not all their methods, one of which involved the commandeering of the squad\u2019s coach when they were on board before a match and crashing it into parked cars \u2013 that after his Test career ended in 1971 he committed himself to political change in South Africa.\nHe was interviewed by the Rugby Paper last November, after Siya Kolisi, the first black captain of the Springboks, had held aloft the World Cup in Yokohama and spoken movingly about his hope that rugby would help unify a divided nation. Those protesting in 1969-70 \u2013 the Stop the Seventy Tour was chaired by Peter Hain and one of the organisers in Scotland was Gordon Brown \u2013 were written off by the rugby media here as idealists and do-gooders, irritants who did not understand rugby union\u2019s fraternity.\nIf any of the reporters watched last year\u2019s World Cup, they should by then have come to appreciate not only what the protest was about but that politics and sport were not mutually exclusive, not least because governments such as South Africa\u2019s in the apartheid era used sport for sustenance; and it was South Africa who blocked Basil D\u2019Oliveira after the Worcestershire all-rounder was called up as a replacement for the MCC\u2019s 1968-69 tour, saying it was a politically motivated selection when it seemed that his original omission was exactly that.\n\u201cWe knew that no other country could afford a tour like this,\u201d said Bedford last year. \u201cThat was the catalyst for change in a radical way. When I got back to South Africa from the UK I took time out. I went to a deserted part of the country and I thought about Peter Hain, Bernadette Devlin and all those anti-apartheid people who put us in this laager [camp]. I came to the conclusion that maybe they did have a point.\u201d\nSchoeman largely concerns himself with the tour itself, his book ending with a short chapter entitled Aftermath. He interviewed several of the South Africa squad, including Bedford and the captain, Dawie de Villiers, who was to serve on Nelson Mandela\u2019s first cabinet following the fall of the apartheid regime, as well as a player from each of the four home unions: the Springboks lost against England and Scotland before drawing with Ireland and Wales and were beaten by Oxford University, Newport and Gwent in the first two weeks of the trip.\nMandela was on Robben Island when the matches were played. A news blackout for the prisoners was undermined by the warders, who were unable to hide their frustration at both the results and the protests. \u201cIt was as if Mandela and his comrades were to blame,\u201d said Peter, now Lord, Hain. \u201cHis apartheid jailers were beside themselves with rage and that gave him a glimmer of hope.\u201d\nThe protestors succeeded in forcing the postponement of one match, Ulster, while the opener against Oxford University, which was played exactly 50 years before South Africa\u2019s victorious 2019 World Cup squad returned home, was switched from Iffley Road to Twickenham on police advice. Protestors who invaded pitches in the early matches were often dealt with by stewards, not always leniently, prompting the government to decree that only the police could take such action.\nPersonal memories of the tour are disappointment that Cardiff were overwhelmed by players who were far bigger than the usual opponents at the Arms Park. The politics went over the head of a young boy whose questions were to find answers later as rugby, showing its amateur status then, continued to maintain links with South Africa: New Zealand, France, England, South America, Ireland and the Lions all toured there at least once up to 1984. The visit of the Springboks to New Zealand in 1981 sparked protests that rivalled 1969-70 and two matches were called off.\nNew Zealand were due to visit in 1985 but their tour was called off after a high court ruling that it would contravene the union\u2019s stated purpose of fostering and encouraging the game of rugby. The Cavaliers went there the following year, for money according to reports. It was apartheid\u2019s last, laboured gasp, strangled by the sporting boycott.\n This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

        "content": "Kentucky governor Andy Beshear took early measures to halt the spread of Covid-19 while Tennessee limited government mandates\nJust last month, when he was still regularly wearing a suit and tie, Kentucky\u2019s rookie governor, Andy Beshear, told schools across the southern state that they needed to be prepared to close down with little notice to contain the spread of Covid-19.\nAt the time, there were just a handful of cases in Kentucky. Bars and restaurants were still open, people shook hands and live sports was on TV. But on 11 March, Beshear, a 42-year-old Democrat, told Kentucky residents that the actions they took over the next month would be critical in determining how the state would fare in the pandemic.\nAs Beshear was wrapping up, the man he defeated by just 5,136 votes in November\u2019s gubernatorial election offered a glimpse of how differently he might have handled the health emergency had he been victorious.\n\u201cBREAKING NEWS: Chicken Little has just confirmed that the sky IS indeed falling,\u201d wrote the former Republican governor Matt Bevin on Twitter. \u201cEveryone is advised to take cover immediately and bring lots of toilet paper when they do so \u2026\u201d\nWhether Bevin would have remained so blase if he were actually governor is impossible to know.\nOn paper, Kentucky is not poised to do well in a pandemic. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 43.6% of Kentucky\u2019s adult population is at a higher risk for serious illness if infected with Covid-19, putting Kentucky\u2019s risk factor second only to West Virginia\u2019s in the US.\nKentucky had reported 3,373 Covid-19 cases with 185 deaths as of Wednesday. Though it is not out of the woods, experts say the state appears to be flattening the curve.\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that we are seeing slower acceleration than has been seen in other states and I do think it is largely due to the social distancing measures that were implemented early and aggressively,\u201d said Kathleen Winter, an epidemiologist with the University of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say we\u2019re really on the right track and whether this will have a longer-lasting impact.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not where we want to be ultimately, but we\u2019re certainly making progress,\u201d said Paul McKinney, associate dean for research at the University of Louisville\u2019s school of public health and information sciences. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not nearly as bad as we could have been.\u201d\nWhile other states lagged behind, Kentucky was nearly keeping pace with measures adopted in coronavirus hotspots like New York: on 5 March Beshear started holding daily press briefings on the virus; on the 6th, he declared a state of emergency; on the 16th he closed down bars and restaurants; on the 19th he banned all mass gatherings, including church services; and on the 22nd he announced the closure of all businesses that were not \u201clife sustaining\u201d.\nCombined with his quick pandemic response, his calm, empathetic daily briefings (which he starts by saying, \u201cRepeat after me: we will get through this.\u201d) have seen his popularity explode in recent weeks. Some have likened him to Mr Rogers, but he has also been firm, calling out those that have defied social distancing orders, including dozens of people who protested against the stay-at-home measures last week.\n\u201cI think that the governor here, our current governor, took the right approach,\u201d said McKinney when asked about how Kentucky\u2019s coronavirus might have looked with different election results.\nAl Cross, director of the University of Kentucky\u2019s institute for rural journalism and community issues and a longtime observer of politics in the Bluegrass state, said he couldn\u2019t say that Bevin would necessarily have handled the situation differently and that many had made \u201ca lot of stupid assumptions\u201d about how the former governor might act.\n\u201cIt would certainly be in character for Bevin to behave more like the Republican governors who have been more lax than Beshear, but I have to believe that he would keep an open mind on this question because it\u2019s so fundamentally important,\u201d he said. \u201cGranted, this is the guy who exposed his children to chicken pox because he thought it was the best thing for them.\u201d\nTo get a sense of how things might have looked with different leadership, Kentuckians have been looking across their southern border into Tennessee, where Governor Bill Lee was initially reluctant to close down bars, restaurants and non-essential businesses, hoping to find a balance between economic security and public health.\nLee held off on issuing such a stay-at-home order even as the state\u2019s three largest cities \u2013 Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville \u2013 issued orders of their own. While Lee issued recommendations for Tennesseans to avoid crowds, he said no mandates were necessary to keep them apart, that the state\u2019s residents could be trusted to do their part without government interference.\nIn the end, Tennessee adopted many of the same measures that Kentucky did \u2013 but they usually came about a week later.\nAs Tennessee lagged behind, Beshear warned Kentuckians not to travel there in late March.\nTennessee had reported 7,842 confirmed cases and 166 deaths as of Wednesday. Charts created by Kentucky resident and educator Stephanie Jolly comparing infection rates and numbers in Tennessee and Kentucky show a steeper rise in cases in Tennessee while Kentucky maintained a flatter curve. They have received a fair deal of attention in Kentucky recently as a sign that social distancing efforts have paid off, though there are caveats: Tennessee has conducted more testing and has a higher population and Winter, the epidemiologist, says it\u2019s more useful to look at hospitalizations, though that data is harder to acquire.\n\u201cI think we could have been facing a very different outcome and a lot of Kentuckians are recognizing that as well,\u201d said Jolly.\nCiting the devastating economic impact of the shutdown and an assertion that the virus\u2019s spread had been slowed to a manageable level, Lee announced on Monday that he would not be extending Tennessee\u2019s stay-at-home order past its 30 April expiration and that some businesses could begin reopening as soon as 27 April.\n\u201cWhile the health outlook is showing signs of improvement, our economic outlook tells a very different story: record unemployment numbers, thousands of businesses closed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the good of our state, social distancing must continue but our economic shutdown cannot.\u201d\nHowever, the lifting of restrictions does not apply to six Tennessee counties that have their own health departments \u2013 among them, the counties home to the state\u2019s largest cities. Those areas will formulate their own reopening strategies and timelines.\nLee\u2019s announcement came as the governors of Georgia and South Carolina said that they, too, would be reopening their economies and relaxing restrictions in the coming days.\nAcross the border in Kentucky, Beshear has remained more cautious, saying a limited reopening is dependent on meeting benchmarks, particularly a 14-day decline in the number of new cases and the expansion of testing capabilities. And although businesses may reopen in the coming weeks and months, Beshear has worked to temper expectations that life will fully return back to normal soon, saying gatherings like summer weddings and even fall sporting events may be in jeopardy.\nOn Monday, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned that failing to follow careful guidelines of a gradual reopening could \u201cbackfire\u201d and result in a surge in cases.\n\u201cIt does go to show why elections matter and that elections have consequences,\u201d said James Line, 24, a former Beshear campaign staffer who is the administrator of a Beshear meme Facebook group that has gained popularity as a result of the governor\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \u201cIf 5,000 votes had gone the other way we would have another governor right now and probably a lot more lives lost.\u201d",

        "content": "Even as the city mourns lost greats and its clubs are silent, musicians have taken to the streets with a special kind of concert\nAt the corner of Frenchman and Royal, in the heart of New Orleans\u2019 Marigny neighborhood, the silence is chilling.\nOn any normal day, in any normal time, this once busy intersection and its row of jazz clubs would pump drum beats and piano flourishes into the open, on to streets lined with people.\nBut now the boarded-up venues tell their own stories of tragedy.\nAt the Snug Harbor Bistro, one of the landmark clubs in this city that gave birth to jazz, a black wreath is hung from the entrance. It marks the passing of master pianist and jazz pioneer Ellis Marsalis, who died earlier this month after contracting Covid-19, aged 85.\n\u201cHe will forever stand as a foundation pillar of the Snug Harbor musical legacy,\u201d reads a small sign taped to the window, \u201cHis reach as a teacher is endless among generations of students who will continue to play our stage.\u201d\nIn an indication of the speed and ferocity with which coronavirus has ravaged New Orleans, taking 632 lives here by the latest count, an outdated gig poster is still tacked to the adjacent window, showing that Marsalis and his youngest son Jason, a jazz drummer, had been scheduled to play here on 27 March. New Orleans\u2019 stay at home order has been extended until 16 May.\nThe emptiness on Frenchman Street is illustrative of a city lamenting the loss of its culture of live music. Musicians who have performed for decades at these venues are now cooped up inside, rehearsing alone, hit hard by the loss of revenue and the elation of performing in front of crowds. Mourning those giants of the scene that were taken by the virus.\nAnd yet, for all the pain and the quiet, it is impossible to completely drown out melody here. Many musicians in the city have adapted to the temporary silence by holding online gigs, mobile concerts and internet recording sessions. It is still possible to hear the sound of a lone trumpet emanating from a home or a violin echoing down streets.\n\u201cNumb, I guess that\u2019s the word,\u201d said Derrick Freeman, a snare drummer and band leader with Soul Brass Band, as he tried to describe the feeling of losing his ability to play live and interact with an audience in person.\nHe recalled the day, Sunday 15 March, when his phone erupted with notifications of gig cancellations. \u201cI woke to the email notifications. Sixteen in a row.\u201d he said. April is one of the busiest months in the year for performers in the city: festivals, weddings, shows packed with tourists. All are lost sources of revenue, forcing many to rely on music foundation assistance and to claim federal unemployment benefits.\nFreeman, a mainstay on the scene here, is one of many musicians of his generation mentored by Marsalis. .\n\u201cEllis is one of the main reasons I ended up in New Orleans. He basically recruited me out of high school, one of the first people to hire me to play. It\u2019s been a rough week. A tragedy,\u201d he said.\nOn one recent humid afternoon, a few hundred feet from Frenchman Street, the distinguished vibrato of a single violin reverberated off wrought-iron balconies and the wooden facades of shotgun homes.\nIn a marker of the creativity that punctuates life in this city, two young women, violinist Anna Roznowska and pedicab driver Sarah Grant, have taken matters into their own hands and begun performing mobile concerts.\nWith Grant pedalling and Roznowska seated in the carriage, improvising a series of soaring riffs, the mobile concert wove through the streets of the Marigny, drawing people on to their doorsteps, their front lawns and the roadside, all standing at safe distances and listening.\n\u201cNew Orleans has never been so quiet before,\u201d said Roznowska \u201cYou can strum a few notes and they go so far. They echo.\u201d\nLike most other musicians here, she lost much of her income as soon as the pandemic struck. She had performed every day as a street musician, relying on tips from tourists in the city\u2019s Jackson Square. Grant, a full time pedicab driver, also lost her livelihood when the tourist industry evaporated overnight in early March.\n\u201cWhen they come through it\u2019s just this refreshing reminder of what this neighborhood usually feels like,\u201d said Scott Heath, a literature professor, who came out on to the street to film the pair on his phone. \u201cUsually here you can close your eyes any time of the night and hear music coming from somewhere.\u201d\nOther local musicians have taken to online shows and shared internet recording sessions to receive tips and continue to create while on lockdown.\nMicah McKee, a singer-songwriter who gigged about four nights a week before the pandemic, is essentially now locked inside, his asthma making him especially vulnerable to the virus. He records his own guitar and vocal tracks before emailing them to his bandmates to add their parts, and then mixes them together.\nWhen New Orleans edges closer to normality, he expects a creative outpouring.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re back, we\u2019re going to be hitting it hard,\u201d McKee said. \u201cPeople are going to be so pent up and ready to dance. This has got to be, already, the longest time in New Orleans history that musicians have gone without jamming together.\u201d",

        "content": "The tech giant\u2019s pledge to go carbon negative by 2030 leans heavily on nascent technology such as machines that suck carbon out of the air\nMicrosoft drew widespread praise in January this year after Brad Smith, the company\u2019s president, announced their climate \u201cmoonshot\u201d.\nWhile other corporate giants, such as Amazon and Walmart, were pledging to go carbon neutral, Microsoft vowed to go carbon negative by 2030, meaning they would be removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they produced.\nBy 2050, Smith added, the company was aiming to remove all of the carbon they had ever emitted since being founded in 1975.\nThe firm\u2019s promises won plaudits from conservationists and climate conscious Microsoft employees, but also attracted big questions: how are they going to actually deliver this?\nMuch of its plans lean on nascent technology. Critics, meanwhile, see the move as a gamble aimed at justifying Microsoft\u2019s ongoing deals with fossil fuel firms.\nMicrosoft releases less carbon a year than Amazon and Apple, but more than Google. The company has 150,000 employees across offices in more than 100 countries, and is still focused on developing the software and consumer electronics that made them a household name \u2013 Windows, PCs, Xbox. But after a temporary slump following their heyday in the 1990s, they have also once again become innovators, developing world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products.\nThe company hopes to bring that innovative approach to its climate policies, in part by widening how it calculates its carbon footprint, beyond most corporate responsibility plans. Historically, Microsoft has only counted those emissions that fall within the scope of their own business operations \u2013 employee travel, company vehicles, heat and electricity in company buildings, and so on.\nFrom now on, it plans to take responsibility for the emissions produced by its entire supply chain, including the full lifespan of the products it makes and the electricity that customers may consume when using its products.\nMeanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft\u2019s plan are its dealings with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using Microsoft\u2019s technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on Microsoft\u2019s expanded carbon ledger.\nFor Microsoft, however, partnering with oil companies is not considered hypocritical. The company is hedging its climate bets on carbon capture and removal technologies that they believe will be able to offset some of the environmental harm caused by fossil fuels during the transition to a more sustainable future, despite such technologies being still in their nascent stages and not yet proven to work at scale.\nThose who devised the plan at Microsoft argue that they are responding directly to a new reality: cutting emissions is not enough and all routes to non-catastrophic temperature increase will also require removing carbon from the atmosphere. So, as well as shifting to a 100% supply of renewable energy for all of their data centers, buildings and campuses by 2025, Microsoft outlines a number of carbon reduction methods it is backing to try and hit its bold targets.\nTo begin, Microsoft will focus on protecting forests and planting trees to capture carbon. This strategy has long been used to offset emissions, but Microsoft is hoping to improve their outcomes by using remote-sensing technology to accurately estimate the carbon storage potential of forests to ensure no major deforestation is occurring in their allotments. To achieve these goals, Microsoft will be partnering with Pachama, a Silicon Valley startup that will survey 60,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon, plus an additional 20,000 hectares across north-eastern states of the US for the company.\nAccording to Kelsey Perlman, a climate campaigner at the forest conservation NGO Fern, Microsoft\u2019s commitment to hi-tech reforestation is encouraging, but she stressed that conservation is a complex, multifaceted process that goes beyond technical issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about how much carbon a forest can hold but also who traditionally uses the forest, how they might be kept out, and how biodiversity will be prioritized,\u201d she said.\nMicrosoft will initially focus on nature-based solutions to reduce their carbon footprint over the next five or so years. But in order to start drawing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit by 2030, it will need to shift to technology-based solutions that can scale up and accelerate carbon removal.\nTo this end, Microsoft is betting on biomass energy carbon capture storage, otherwise known as BECCS, to transform how energy is generated. Instead of burning coal, a BECCS power plant burns biomass, like wood chips. The carbon produced when burning the biomass is captured before it is released into the atmosphere and then injected at a very high pressure into rock formations deep underground. Not only does this remove carbon from the natural cycle, the biomass absorbs CO2 as it grows.\nA world powered by biofuel, however, raises two looming questions. First, scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral.\nThe second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land \u2013 some estimates say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and reducing biodiversity. \u201cWe would likely see massive land use change and massive private purchases of land, the knock on impacts of which could be quite dangerous,\u201d she said.\nPerhaps the most futuristic of the technologies outlined in Microsoft\u2019s carbon negative plan is direct air capture (DAC). This involves machines that essentially function like highly efficient artificial trees, drawing existing carbon out of the air and transforming it into non-harmful carbon-based solids or gasses.\nWhile the image of air-conditioner-like machines sucking carbon out of the air is captivating, capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere requires a lot of energy and is very expensive. In 2011, extracting carbon from the air cost $600 a ton of CO2. In 2018, estimates brought this down to anywhere between $94 to $232 a ton. But given that Microsoft expects to emit 16m metric tons of carbon this year, if they were to reach carbon zero using only DAC, their bill might cost as much as $3.5bn.\nAccording to Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, a large part of the reason why carbon removal remains so expensive is because the markets around these technologies are still immature. The company\u2019s strategy over the coming decades is maturing these markets through intensive and directed investment. \u201cWe\u2019re making a bet on certain technologies that don\u2019t exist at the scale or price point we need them to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we want to get them, we need to start investing.\u201d\nThe company, he said, already has a model for raising funds internally to support climate innovation. In July 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to institute an internal carbon price, charging different divisions in the business $15 a metric ton of carbon emitted. The funds raised were then used to pay for sustainability improvements, which helped the company achieve their goal of going carbon neutral.\nPreviously, this carbon price only extended over emissions Microsoft was directly responsible for. According to their new plan, in July this year Microsoft will extend this internal carbon price over emissions produced across direct and indirect emissions. The increased revenue raised from the expanded internal carbon tax, along with a $1bn climate innovation fund, will be used to invest in capture and removal technology. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is put this money in the market in a way that is highly additional,\u201d Joppa said. \u201cThis is how we\u2019re going to get nature-based solutions and tech solutions at a price point and scale we need.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s plan for intensive investment in this industry is exciting for those working in the field. Klaus Lackner, a theoretical physicist working on DAC, has been arguing since the 1990s that carbon removal is the only feasible way to stop significant temperature rises. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that this method is technologically feasible, but nobody has wanted them,\u201d he said. \u201cMicrosoft have said \u2018we get it\u2019. It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps.\u201d\nWhile the technologies that Microsoft are betting on are still in their nascent stages, in the past few years there has been some encouraging progress in the negative emissions industry. Lackner and Arizona State University recently signed a deal with Silicon Kingdom, an Irish-based company, to manufacture his carbon-suck machines. The plan is to install them on wind and solar farms, and then sell the captured carbon to beverage companies to make carbonated drinks. In the UK, Drax power plant, which was once among Europe\u2019s most polluting, has transitioned from coal to biomass.\nBut many attempts at scaling carbon negative projects have also failed. The Kemper Project in Mississippi, which was billed as America\u2019s flagship carbon capture project, was abandoned in 2017 \u2013 it was $5bn over budget, three years late and still not operational.\nGiven the not insignificant risk of failure, some propose that relying on nascent or future technology as a solution to the climate crisis represents a moral hazard \u2013 the promise of carbon removal functions as an incentive for governments and major polluters to not change their behavior now.\nAccording to Chris Adams, a tech worker who organizes an online community of technology professionals agitating for climate action from within the industry, the fact that Microsoft is still partnering with big oil companies demonstrates the moral hazard in action. \u201cThey are protecting the fossil fuel industry from changing while the rest of the world will pay most from this gamble if it fails in the long term,\u201d he said.\nAdams added that many of the encouraging ideas around carbon reduction in Microsoft\u2019s plan have come from internal organizing from concerned employees, but that this mostly goes unacknowledged in Microsoft\u2019s official vision. Emphasizing future technology while overlooking activism in the present, Adams said, represents a certain way of approaching problems that is typical of technology companies. \u201cIf you have spent the last 10 years amassing influence by approaching most problems with technology it\u2019s understandable you see all problems through this lens, particularly if you don\u2019t have to have conversations about power,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked about this concern by the Guardian, Microsoft\u2019s Joppa responded that in the short term, the energy demands of a growing global population will probably still need a mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. By remaining in discourse with these industries, he said, Microsoft hopes to help them change and transition to a better model in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to lead if there\u2019s no one there to follow,\u201d he added.\nAs to whether the technology outlined in their plan will scale, he said there is inherent risk, but this is why they call it a \u201cmoonshot\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to our plan it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got it all figured out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to do what the science says the whole world needs to do. There\u2019s really no other choice.\u201d\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Thursday 23 April.\nThe Ruby Princess has departed Port Kembla on the New South Wales south coast bound for Manila in the Philippines with 370 crew on board.\nThe ship\u2019s arrival in Sydney \u2013 first on 8 March and then again on 18 March \u2013 is linked to more than 600 cases of coronavirus and 21 of its former passengers have died.\nThe debacle surrounding the ship is the subject of a special inquiry. About 10% of Australia\u2019s cases of the virus have been linked to the ship.\nThe treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said 456,000 Australians applied for early access to their superannuation, totalling $3.8bn. The average withdrawal is around $8,000 and people can access up to $10,000 this financial year, and another $10,000 in the next financial year.\nThe big four banks have also promised to fast track loans for businesses waiting for jobkeeper payments to arrive so they can keep paying their employees until then.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 587,686 applications for jobseeker applications had been processed by Services Australia, which is more than the organisation usually does in a year.\nAustralia wants international inspectors to go in and investigate that health and safety standards are being adhered to. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said we must learn from this pandemic.\n\u201cThere are risks with wildlife wet markets and they could be as big a risk to our agricultural industries as they can be to public health, so we have to understand them better.\u201d\nThe operator of the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, Anglicare, says the 79-year-old resident had tested positive for Covid-19 and died very early this morning. She had multiple serious health issues, the organisation said.\nThe facility has had 44 confirmed cases of coronavirus \u2013 29 residents and 15 staff. The federal government has stepped in to support the centre amid concerns about staffing shortages with 55 staff forced to isolate.\nAmid ongoing privacy concerns about the government\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app, the attorney general, Christian Porter, has confirmed regulations will be put in place preventing state and federal law enforcement agencies, or any government agency other than health authorities, accessing the data.\nInternational travel will be the last restriction eased in Australia, health officials say, but there is discussion between Australia and New Zealand to potentially allow travel between the two countries before that.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe media mogul Kerry Stokes and his wife were allowed to avoid mandatory hotel quarantine on medical grounds when they arrived in Western Australia by private jet two weeks ago, and instead spent 14 days holed up in their Perth mansion.\nShould I access my super early during the coronavirus?\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nVirgin Australia: what does voluntary administration mean and how will it affect you?\nHow the coronavirus contact tracing app will work\nJobkeeper payment: check your eligibility.

        "content": "The Diego Maradona and Amy director gorges on spaghetti westerns, succumbs to Disney+ ... but steers clear of disaster flicks\nIn our house we\u2019ve devised a democratic rota for movie viewing. Every night one of us \u2013 me, my wife and our children, who are 13 and nine \u2013 chooses a film for us all to watch. And every Thursday, we do the National Theatre Live (they\u2019re still quoting One Man, Two Guvnors, but Treasure Island was a fail).\nAnd it\u2019s been really fun. For anyone lucky enough, like us, to not have to go out to work, who has a home and a garden and food, this can be weirdly nice family time. We were fortunate in already having lots of DVDs as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime I succumbed to Disney+ because of all the Pixar and Marvel movies.\nAnt-Man was quite good; The Incredibles, Toy Story and Wall-E were brilliant. The youngest picked 101 Dalmatians and we\u2019ve seen all of The Mandalorian. We went through a Spielberg phase \u2013 Jaws, the Indiana Jones films (in the wrong order). The film that went down really well was Inception; the next day we just listened to the soundtrack.\nWe watched Mad Max: Fury Road the other night, which was fantastic and is still crazy. I think everyone had strange dreams that night, our youngest has been trying to make some of the vehicles out of Lego.\nThe kids weren\u2019t so keen on Harold Lloyd but they actually enjoyed the Marx Brothers\u2019 A Night at the Opera. We did fast-forward the songs, but one scene where they move all the furniture out of a room while being chased had us all crying with laughter.\nIt\u2019s quite exciting showing them grown-up films we like. We\u2019ve also done lots of Hitchcock: Rear Window, North by Northwest, The Birds, Vertigo. My wife will occasionally cover our youngest\u2019s eyes if it\u2019s too scary \u2013 The Birds was sometimes \u2013 and we turned off Rope after 10 minutes because my wife felt it was too disturbing.\nIt\u2019s good to sit and discuss films properly, then set them homework for the next day \u2013 like an essay on how they felt watching this or that Hitchcock. It\u2019s also a great age to introduce them to the concept of ratings, and discuss why one film might have got a 12A and the other a 15.\nI\u2019d never seen The Ladykillers, so it was terrific to catch up on that, and Once Upon a Time in the West was a big success. Now I\u2019m thinking of showing them a Kurosawa film, then perhaps a short spaghetti western my wife and I made as students, if I can find a copy. Maybe one day they\u2019ll watch The Warrior. We\u2019ve discussed watching one of the movies I directed, but it seems like a waste of a choice.\nOne other thing we haven\u2019t watched is disaster movies; I\u2019d like to rewatch Contagion, but don\u2019t think the children should. The other night I tried Wings of Desire. That really didn\u2019t go well. You could see the kids\u2019 minds were blown by the concept of angels hearing people\u2019s thoughts, but it was a tad too mature. Still, at least it got everybody to bed early that evening.",

The West Midlands police, which covers Birmingham, recorded an increase of 13%.\nIn separate Home Office statistics, the proportion of recorded offences that resulted in a charge or summons fell from 8.3% to 7.1% in 2019.\nLondon was an exception to the trend of an overall drop in knife killings. The number of homicides \u2013 murders or manslaughter offences \u2013 involving a knife or sharp instrument decreased by 8% in 2019 to 242 offences. But in the capital there was a 13% increase in homicides involving a knife or sharp instrument, from 77 to 87.\nData for Greater Manchester police was not included in the ONS release owing to IT issues at the force.\nThe total number of homicides in England and Wales was up 2% in 2019 to 670. This figure includes the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex.\nAgain, the numbers in London were proportionally much higher, with a 15% increase in homicides from 127 to 146 recorded by the Metropolitan police in 2019.\nThe homicide rate in the population remained very low, at 12 for every 1 million people, the ONS added.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), a different measure of police-recorded offences, which assesses experience of crime, estimated that more than 10.4m offences were experienced by adults aged 16 years and over in 2019 \u2013 a significant decrease of 5% from the previous year.\nJoe Traynor, from the ONS Centre for Crime and Justice, said: \u201cIt is not possible to say whether this would have come to represent a change from the flat trend in recent years, as it is likely that the current lockdown will have an impact on the level of crime in 2020.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThese damning figures show the Conservative government continues to fail communities on crime, especially when it comes to knife crime.\n\u201cThis has been the inevitable consequence of huge cuts to policing and the loss of 21,000 officers, and the cuts to the key services we rely on to prevent crime, such as youth clubs, mental health support and probation.\n\u201cThe failure on crime shows again the devastating impact of austerity and why our country can\u2019t afford to make the same mistakes when we emerge from the coronavirus crisis.\u201d\nCommenting on the 5% drop in overall crime recorded by the Crime Survey of England and Wales, the homesSecretary Priti Patel said: \u201cThis is extremely encouraging and a positive step in the right direction, but I remain steadfast in ensuring the criminal minority do not get away with their crimes.\n\u201cI will continue to give the police the stop and search powers, funding and extra officers they need to keep our families, communities and country safe.\n\u201cCutting crime is an absolute priority for the British people \u2013 therefore a priority for me and this government.\u201d",

Now that they are closed it\u2019s become really important that I fill that spiritual void.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can listen to on YouTube but having a live connection with your imam and local scholars through Mixlr, GoMeet or Zoom, is a great way of keeping spirits high.\n\u201cI think, in a positive way, this will definitely become the norm even after things have calmed down.\n\u201cBy using these platforms, the mosques are also capturing the attention of a demographic which have been increasingly hard to reach \u2013 the youth. I know many young people are listening to sermons from their local mosques as opposed to the usual \u2018social media\u2019 scholars online.\u201d\nMosques around the country are traditionally full with a congregation for the daily Taraweeh night prayers which often finish around midnight. For the next 29 or 30 days of Ramadan, those prayers along with the five daily prayers will be undertaken from home.\nThe London mayor, Sadiq Khan, actor Riz Ahmed and television presenter Konnie Huq are among the prominent British personalities who have collaborated for a new coronavirus advice video for the #RamadanAtHome campaign.\nAmong the mosques using conferencing apps to connect virtually with Muslims in lockdown are the Bury Park Jamie Masjid and Leagrave Hall Masjid in Luton.\nAshfaque Chowdhury, a member of the management team at Leagrave Hall Masjid, said: \u201cCovid-19 has had tremendous impact on communities and has isolated them to their homes with little availability of spiritual moral social, cultural and mental health support.\n\u201cTo rise to the challenge, Leagrave Hall Masjid has digitised its facilities online with live Friday sermons via Mixlr and GoMeet.\n\u201cPrayers for the deceased are now performed with their families online via go to meeting and Google classrooms is used to keep the teaching of the Qur\u2019an alive amongst the young people.\u201d\nFinsbury Park mosque in north London will be streaming lectures and prayers and offering online counselling while volunteers will distribute food to staff at local hospitals.\nCambridge Muslim College is hosting a curated series of daily online talks from scholars on topics including the Qur\u2019an, hadith, self-improvement, arts, culture and astronomy.\nOther virtual initiatives include the Ramadan Tent Project, where people sign up to receive recipes, decorations and games and can participate in a virtual Iftar via the Zoom app.\nWith many restaurants closed and government advice to avoid visiting friends and family, Muslims are increasingly turning to bloggers and chefs on social media for inspiration for recipes to prepare the morning Suhoor meal at dawn and the evening meal at around 9pm.\nThey include Alia Al Kasimi, a chef of Moroccan heritage, who has 357,000 YouTube subscribers.\nBilal El Amri, 36, a facilities assistant in London, will be turning to the Cooking with Alia YouTube channel for inspiration.\nHe said: \u201cThis year I will watch a recipe video three or four times, write down ingredients, see if I have them in the fridge, buy the ingredients I need then come back and start cooking to the recipe.\n\u201cAlia\u2019s website and YouTube channel has so many recipes which remind me of my Moroccan background.\n\u201cThings I haven\u2019t tasted for months or even years. It makes me feel close to my family, it triggers part of my muscle memory from the past.\n\u201cI make tagines, harira soup, lots of mezes with olives. On a weekend I will make a fish cake.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cNormally during Ramadan I would go to my cousin\u2019s house to break the fast a few times, invite friends round, or prepare food with my wife and then go to the masjid.\n\u201cWith my cousins in London we will have a Skype video conference, we can even pray together virtually.\u201d\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has published guidelines on how to celebrate Ramadan in lockdown with advice on how to arrange \u201cvirtual iftars\u201d online with family, friends and community members by using video chat.\nThe guidelines also encourage people to buy food for the iftar meal in advance to avoid multiple shopping trips.\nIt says: \u201cDue to the likely inability to host in-person iftars this Ramadan, one way to connect with friends and loved ones is to host \u2018virtual iftars\u2019, in which individuals or families can join via video conferencing facilities like Zoom, FaceTime or video-calling apps like Skype or WhatsApp.\n\u201cThis could be an important way for individuals to stay connected during these times, especially for those who are living alone or away from family.\u201d\nQari Asim, an imam in Leeds, wrote on Twitter that \u201calthough emotionally challenging, we\u2019ve an opportunity to truly understand the meaning of Ramadan and practise it [in] solitude and spiritually nourish our souls\u201d.",

As she turned to look, she felt something wet in her face. Within seconds, her vision went cloudy and she smelled bleach.\n\u201cThey picked me out because I was wearing scrubs,\u201d said the ear, nose and throat doctor from the Mexican city of Guadalajara, as she described the attack which left her with conjunctivitis and burns on her skin. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything \u2013 I don\u2019t know who it was, but I know they attacked another doctor on the same day.\u201d\nIn most of the world, medical staff have been lauded as heroes for their response to the coronavirus pandemic. But in Mexico, the growing number of Covid-19 cases has brought with it a wave of violence against nurses and doctors who have wrongly been accused of spreading the disease.\nAt least 21 medical workers have been attacked in 12 states across the country, according to Fabiana Zepeda, the head of nursing for the Mexican Social Security Institute.\nHer voice breaking with emotion, Zepeda told reporters this week that many health workers had started to change out of their uniforms when they travelled to and from work, to avoid being targeted.\n\u201cI have worn my nurse\u2019s uniform for 27 years with great pride \u2013 as do doctors. But today we are taking off our uniforms because we don\u2019t want to be injured,\u201d she said.\nSo far, Mexico has seen 9,501 confirmed coronavirus cases, and 857 deaths, but health officials admit that the true infection level is at least eight times higher as the country has limited testing capacity.\nOn Tuesday, the health undersecretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell who has led Mexico\u2019s response to the pandemic, announced that the virus had reached the stage of rapid spread, and warned that \u201ca large number of infections and hospitalisations\u201d were imminent.\nThe country\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, drew criticism for initially downplaying the need for social distancing measures, and doctors and nurses have held protests and strikes over the lack of personnel and safety equipment.\nMeanwhile, health workers have themselves been stigmatised and blamed for spreading the disease.\nOn social media, health workers have been targeted by trolls, but doctors and nurses have also been barred from their homes, denied service in restaurants and supermarkets, forced out of buses and metro carriages \u2013 and even attacked in the streets.\nSandra, a nurse in the city of San Luis Potos\u00ed described in a Facebook post how she was attacked by a woman and her two children as she left a coffee shop on her way to the hospital.\n\u201cShe hit me in the face, and I had no choice but to defend myself. We ended up on the pavement, me trying to defend myself because I was proudly wearing my white uniform. I fractured two fingers on my right hand,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Mexico? We\u2019re just trying to go to work. I care for you \u2013 but you don\u2019t care for me. No more attacks on health workers!\u201d\nSome health workers have been forced from their homes.\nAfter an eight-hour shift attending to suspected coronavirus patients at the hospital in the northern tourist resort of San Francisco, Melody found that the road into her home village had been blockaded.\nAngry residents had closed the village, Lo de Marcos, to tourists and health workers. Melody was eventually allowed in under police escort \u2013 but only to collect her belongings and leave the village.\n\u201cIt was really painful. I was scared for my safety \u2013 and I even ended up wondering if I really was spreading the virus. Now I\u2019m staying with colleagues from the hospital because I have nowhere else to go. It\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said.\nZepeda, the chief nurse, called on Mexicans to remember the sacrifices that medical workers are making in their response to the epidemic. So far 150 health workers have contracted Covid-19 and six have died. \u201cWe beg those people who have attacked doctors and nurses to reconsider,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could end up saving your lives.\u201d",

Plus, why Bad Education is Hugh Jackman\u2019s best ever role\n Good morning. A top US government doctor has turned whistleblower after he says he was pushed out of his role in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. Rick Bright told the New York Times he believed he was dismissed as director of the US health department\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority because he resisted Donald Trump\u2019s push to use an unproven malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a treatment for Covid-19:\nContrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.\nTrump and his cheerleaders at Fox News have recently backed away from promoting the possible benefits of hydroxychloroquine, after a trial of the drug in US veterans hospitals went badly. The president told reporters on Wednesday that he had \u201cnever heard of\u201d Bright.\nThe studies so far. There have been several scientific studies of hydroxychloroquine and Covid-19, writes Julia Carrie Wong \u2013 but none have produced evidence that the drug works.\nDespite expressing his support for the anti-lockdown movement, Trump said on Wednesday that he \u201cstrongly\u201d disagrees with Georgia governor Brian Kemp\u2019s decision to reopen bowling alleys, hair salons and other businesses this weekend. Many of the state\u2019s business owners have also concluded it is \u201cway too early\u201d to return to normal.\nBut Kemp is far from the only leader eschewing the lockdown. In South Dakota, where Republican governor Kristi Noem never issued a stay-at-home order, hundreds of people are expected to attend motor races this weekend. And the mayor of Las Vegas told CNN she would \u201clove everything open\u201d and said her city could be a \u201ccontrol group\u201d to assess the impact of the virus.\nA tale of two states. Kentucky and Tennessee share a border, but their governors took very different approaches to their coronavirus outbreaks and, as Josh Wood reports, they have seen very different outcomes.\nNew voters go unregistered. The pandemic has made it almost impossible to register new voters using traditional methods in states across the US. That could have a huge impact on November\u2019s election, writes Sam Levine.\nMainland China reported 55,000 cases of coronavirus in the country\u2019s first wave of infections. But a study by researchers in Hong Kong suggests that number would have been more like 232,000, had the later adopted definition of a Covid-19 case been applied from the outset.\nBy contrast, South Korea had some of the most reliable infection numbers, suffered a comparatively low death toll and is now beginning to return to something like normal life. Justin McCurry explains how it got there.\nMeanwhile, in\u2026\n\u2026Italy, relatives of those killed by the coronavirus have launched a Facebook effort to take legal action against the authorities, over what they claim were errors made at the start of the country\u2019s outbreak.\n\u2026Mexico, at least 21 doctors and nurses have suffered violent attacks, in public, after being wrongly accused of spreading the disease.\nA doctor from Bolinas, California, says her small town north of San Francisco is hoping to become a \u201cmodel\u201d for the rest of the country, after resolving to test every single member of its community for Covid-19. The town raised $300,000 through GoFundMe to buy testing equipment for its population of 1,600, to help researchers understand how the virus spreads.\nEarly deaths. Tissue samples from the autopsy of a 57-year-old woman who died in northern California on 6 February have tested positive for Covid-19, suggesting the coronavirus started killing Americans weeks earlier than was originally thought.\nCovid-19 in cats. Two cats in New York state have tested positive for the virus, apparently after catching it from humans \u2013 the first confirmed cases of US pets catching Covid-19.\n\u2018Catastrophic\u2019 flooding is coming soon. That\u2019s according to new research, which has found that the number of people affected by floods will double to around 147 million annually by the end of the 2020s.\nIran puts its first military satellite in orbit. The reported launch of the \u201cNoor\u201d ratchets up existing tensions between Tehran and Washington, with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, saying it violates a 2015 UN security council resolution.\nA million-dollar art heist was caught on camera. A Dutch crime show broadcast footage of a man with a sledgehammer smashing his way into a museum in the Netherlands on 30 March, and fleeing with a Van Gogh painting under his arm.\nIs Bad Education Hugh Jackman\u2019s best performance yet?\nThe X-Men and Greatest Showman star\u2019s latest role is that of Frank Tassone, a real-life school district superintendent who turned out to have been skimming millions from the budget, in HBO\u2019s new drama Bad Education. It\u2019s the performance of his career, writes Charles Bramesco.\nNew Orleans musicians mourn with a new kind of show\nThe city that gave birth to jazz has lost hundreds to coronavirus, including one of its musical greats, the pianist Ellis Marsalis. Rather than go silent, his disciples have adapted to lockdown with online gigs, mobile concerts and internet recording sessions, as Oliver Laughland reports.\nTherapy under lockdown: \u2018I\u2019m as terrified as my patients\u2019\nGary Greenberg, a psychotherapist for 35 years, is still seeing his patients via videocall. Even Freud at his most misanthropic, he writes, could not have imagined that when we need each other most, the best we can do to care for each other is keep well apart.\nGreta Thunberg has said the global response to Covid-19 shows what can be achieved when society listens to scientists. New Zealand\u2019s climate minister, James Shaw, argues that instead of returning to normal after this crisis, we should reset our economies to tackle the bigger challenge ahead.\nIf we spend the next few years restoring business as usual, we will have only a few years left to transform that business as usual into something else. It simply won\u2019t be able to be done.\nA Welsh health minister has apologised after he forgot to turn off his mic during a Zoom call with the country\u2019s assembly \u2013 and accidentally broadcast a sweary rant about a colleague.

While sales of individual titles are not released, research firm NPD estimates that total sales of gaming software in the US jumped 34% in March to $739m (\u00a3598m), the most for that month in almost a decade.\nThe new Animal Crossing, where players become cute animal villagers and turn a barren desert island into a colourful paradise, has proved an international hit, with sales estimated at more than 3m in the first three weeks after launching on the Switch console on 20 March.\nIn the UK, the title immediately raced to the top of the charts, outmuscling perennial favourites including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, the biggest-selling global title last year, including 1.2m sales in the UK, as well as FIFA 2020, and Doom Eternal, which it pushed off the No1 spot.\nWith a wider multigenerational family fanbase than most bestselling titles, Animal Crossing is now the biggest single game launched on Nintendo Switch, and is proving to be an escapist antidote to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe title currently ranks as the second-most popular in the UK, according to the latest sales figures for the week ending 16 April.\n\u201cThe widespread stay-at-home response to the coronavirus pandemic has lent itself to increased video game engagement and spending,\u201d said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush.\nThe total UK video games market, including buying software, consoles and online gaming, hit \u00a35.35bn last year, according to new figures published by the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie) this week.\nThis represents a 4.8% drop on 2018 as gamers hold back on some spending as they await the launch of new next-generation consoles.

Kookaburras, no doubt. None of your soft Ooh-Jimmy-and-Duke-under-English-cloud nonsense. Strictly the right stuff here, for a batsman on a hiding to nothing.\nMorgan is now the man who owns breakfast as Good Morning Britain co-host with Susanna Reid, the duo presenting must-see telly during the coronavirus pandemic. But until a December day in 2013 Morgan, for me, was just a hack with loud opinions. One over was all it took to change my mind, when one of those opinions \u2013 on this occasion slating England\u2019s batsmen as they lurched towards an Ashes whitewash \u2013 landed him in an MCG net to face six blistering deliveries from Brett Lee, one of the most lethal bowlers in cricket history.\nThis, then, is a love letter to PS Pughe-Morgan \u2013 right-hand bat, left-hand battered \u2013 who faced an over of terror and lived to tell the tale. In six deliveries he scored a \u201ccracked wrist, bruised rib\u201d and a \u201cmassive egg\u201d on the back of his head. Indeed, the rib turned out to be broken. Sledging the England team has its drawbacks after all.\nSo where does this over rank among cricket\u2019s best? Andrew Flintoff to Ricky Ponting at Edgbaston in 2005? Meh. Dennis Lillee to Viv Richards at the Waca in 1976? Pfft. Garfield Sobers hitting six sixes at St Helen\u2019s in 1968? Blah. Oh but wait, you say, surely nothing\u2019s better than the super-over to decide the 2019 World Cup? Pah. Morgan v Lee tops the lot.\nLet\u2019s head back to that glorious post-Christmas day and relive every bruise \u2026\nBall 1 Morgan shapes up with a swing and jibe. Asked if he regrets his decision to face Lee, he says: \u201cNo, but I tell you what, I\u2019m about to ruin a great Australian career and legend.\u201d Lee steams in like a dog with three tails and, seeing Morgan backing away (let\u2019s say strategically), follows him to leg \u2026 wide leg. Strike one. \u201cDidn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d And batsman points bowler back to his mark. Class.\nBall 2 Veering towards leg again (expertly \u2026 let\u2019s be kind), Morgan is felled by a bouncer that would have cleared a stadium car park roof. \u201cFucking bring it on mate, bring it on \u2026 try pitching one in my half.\u201d\nBall 3 Struck once more, Morgan is offered the services of the Australian team doctor. The batsman is dented but unbowed: \u201cNo. Bring it on.\u201d\nBall 4 Building a hit parade for the ages, Morgan receives encouragement from Mark Nicholas: \u201cWell, you\u2019re unbeaten Piers.\u201d Swings, roundabouts, etc.\nBall 5 Bowled. Leg stump \u2026 naturally.\nBall 6 Not pretty, but still standing. Win.\nCheers and applause rang out after the barrage and, asked if he was surprised at what he had just encountered, Morgan said of Lee: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a bit quicker than I thought he\u2019d be for his age, to be honest.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s substance behind the quip. As Lee said later: \u201cWhen I was going into the nets to bowl at him he said: \u2018Make sure you go flat out,\u2019 because he thought if I went half-hearted it wouldn\u2019t look good. [Morgan] said he wanted to know what it felt like for the English batsmen to face 150km/h bowling \u2013 and he did it.\u201d\nThe Australian then summed up the scale of courage on show: \u201cConsidering he hasn\u2019t played a top level of cricket, but he does have a great cricketing brain, you have to take your hat off to him \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have got in there and faced that.\u2019\u2019\nOf course there have been naysayers, chief among them Sir Richard Hadlee, who said it was \u201cdangerous and unnecessary\u201d. But they\u2019re wrong. This is one of the greatest moments in cricket. Oh and all right then, good for a lockdown giggle.\nSo hats, caps, helmets and bandages off to Piers Morgan: a hero for our times.",

That figure, which would be more than double the number of deaths in 2018, would mark a return to mortality levels last seen 20 years ago.\n\u201cWhile Covid-19 is a major health threat, it\u2019s critical to maintain malaria prevention and treatment programmes,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s Africa director, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. \u201cThe new modeling shows deaths could exceed 700,000 this year alone. We haven\u2019t seen mortality levels like that in 20 years. We must not turn back the clock.\u201d\nIn 2018, 94% of global deaths from malaria occured in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe WHO said it was crucial for programmes to continue focusing on preventative treatment for pregnant women and children.\nThe organisation has previously warned that Covid-19 could have secondary impacts if restrictions imposed to stop its spread led to other diseases killing more people. It has called on countries to accelerate anti-malaria campaigns while coronavirus cases across Africa remain relatively low.\n\u201cWe have a precious window in which to act before the arrival of peak malaria season in many parts of Africa and the further spread of Covid-19 across the continent,\u201d said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, who heads the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.\nEarlier in April, the WHO advised governments to adapt their malaria campaigns to safeguard against coronavirus infections by preventing large gatherings of people at collection points, and protecting workers distributing treatments and nets.\nThe agency also warned of potential confusion caused by shared symptoms, such as fevers. It cautioned that medical workers in malaria zones should be careful to ensure any patient diagnosed with Covid-19 was also tested for malaria to ensure that illnesses did not go untreated.\nThe WHO praised the leaders of Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Chad for initiating campaigns to distribute nets during the pandemic.\n\u201cRight now the focus must be on making sure that these vital malaria measures go ahead as planned, and frontline health workers have all the help they need to manage the multiple threats to the people they care for,\u201d said James Whiting, chief executive of Malaria No More UK.\n\u201cAs countries rightly look to take measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 we have to do all that we can to make sure that planned malaria prevention \u2013 such as bed net distribution \u2013 doesn\u2019t get disrupted, otherwise the knock on consequences will be grave in terms of young lives lost to malaria.\u201d",
