        "content": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s announcement paves the way for the party backing a second referendum\nYes, in principle. But not quite yet.\nThe party wants MPs to vote on its own Brexit plan on Wednesday first, when the next round of motions about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union are debated in the Commons.\nThat is expected to be defeated, at which point Labour has announced it is \u201ccommitted to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\u201d.\nNo date has been set for the next round of votes, but Theresa May has said that she will put her Brexit deal to the vote on 12 March. A second referendum amendment is expected then.\nThis is not decided. One possibility is that Labour will back the so-called Kyle-Wilson compromise, an amendment being promoted by two Labour backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.\nThe essence of their amendment is that Labour would allow May\u2019s Brexit deal to pass the Commons in return for it being subject to approval via a second referendum.\n \nAugust 2016\nMaking explicit the position he held since the Brexit vote, Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will respect the result of the referendum.\u00a0\"I think we've had a referendum, a decision has been made, you have to respect the decision people made.\"\nJune 2017\nWary of upsetting voters in leave areas, Labour's manifesto for the 2017 general election declares: \"Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.\"\u00a0\nSeptember 2018\nOver five gruelling hours, Labour's internal contradictions over Brexit are distilled into a conference composite motion that makes\u00a0the party's priority to seek a general election but, failing that, says a referendum should not be ruled out.\nFebruary 2019\nChuka Umunna and remain MPs from both Labour and the Conservatives quit to form the Independent Group, citing Brexit as a major motivating factor.\u00a0\nMarch 2019\nLabour backs attempts by backbenchers to keep the option of a public vote on the table to stop a no-deal Brexit or May's deal. When all options considered by parliament fall, Labour enters into Brexit talks with the government but says May must move on a customs union if they are to succeed.\u00a0\nBut there are deep reservations about the Kyle compromise in some Labour circles because it would involve Labour allowing May\u2019s Brexit deal to pass. When asked about the amendment, a Labour source repeated that the party \u201cwould not vote for a damaging Tory Brexit\u201d.\nKyle himself says that Labour could abstain to allow May\u2019s deal through but that may not persuade the doubters. On the other hand, without promising that Labour would allow May\u2019s Brexit deal through parliament, there is no realistic prospect of attracting Conservative support.\nProbably not, although it is not certain. The Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, estimated that there would be 25 Labour MPs who would simply not support a second referendum, regardless of how a motion backing it would be phrased.\nOnly a handful of Tories support a second referendum \u2013 probably fewer than 10 \u2013 so without the support of Downing Street, it remains very unlikely to pass the Commons even with Scottish National party and Liberal Democrat support.\nThe strength of Labour\u2019s move is that it helps bring the parliamentary party together, at a point when the Conservatives are increasingly divided over a no-deal Brexit and the anti-Brexit Independent Group is hoping for more defections from Labour.\nThe principal issue uniting the eight former Labour and three former Conservative MPs in TIG is opposition to Brexit and support for a second referendum. By finally opening the door to supporting a second referendum, Labour closes off their principal selling point.",

        "content": "Labour leader tells MPs party will back another vote as last resort to stop Tory deal\nFollow all the latest on Brexit with our live blog\nJeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party\u2019s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week.\nThe decision to give the party\u2019s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum.\nAlthough the move has delighted MPs who are backing the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Corbyn is likely to face determined opposition from dozens of MPs in leave seats if the party whips to back a second referendum, including a significant number of frontbenchers.\nThe former shadow minister Lucy Powell said she believed at least 25 MPs would vote against any whip to back a second referendum, meaning that it would face an uphill struggle to pass the Commons without significant Conservative support.\nA private briefing sent to Labour MPs on Monday night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that any referendum would need to have a credible leave option and remain,\u201d the briefing said. \u201cObviously at this stage that is yet to be decided and would have to be agreed by parliament.\u201d\nThe briefing also makes it clear that the party would not support no deal being included on the ballot paper. \u201cThere\u2019s no majority for a no-deal outcome and Labour would not countenance supporting no deal as an option,\u201d the briefing says. \u201cWhat we are calling for is a referendum to confirm a Brexit deal, not to proceed to no deal.\u201d\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, indicated on Monday evening that both she and Corbyn would campaign for remain if there were a future public vote.\n\u201cWe would have a referendum on whatever deal it is that may or may not pass through parliament and we would be saying to people: \u2018Do you want this, or do you want to remain?\u2019\u201d she told Channel 4 News.\nThornberry said she \u201cwould certainly be campaigning for us to remain\u201d in those circumstances and, when asked if Corbyn shared that view, she added: \u201cIf it\u2019s a choice between a disastrous Tory Brexit or no deal, and remaining, then that is what we will have to do.\u201d\nThe redrawing of Labour\u2019s objectives is likely to stem any fresh flood of resignations to TIG, whose members include the former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie as well as the ex-Tory MP Anna Soubry, all key figures in the People\u2019s Vote movement.\nCorbyn told MPs the party would back a fresh poll as a final resort in order to stop \u201ca damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\u201d.\nSpeaking to MPs on Monday night, a week after seven MPs who backed a referendum quit the party, Corbyn said Labour would first table its own version of a Brexit deal, including a permanent customs union.\nThat amendment is set to be tabled to the government\u2019s Brexit motion on Wednesday, when Labour will also whip to back another amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper and the Tory Oliver Letwin, which would legislate for a delay to the UK\u2019s exit date in order to avoid no deal.\nMay is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a serious cabinet rebellion over that amendment this week. The Guardian reported last week that at least four cabinet ministers and almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll were ready to rebel and vote for the measure.\nThe prime minister\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit if the withdrawal deal does not pass by 12 March, though Cooper and Letwin\u2019s backers have suggested they will reject that approach.\nParty sources said Labour would not introduce or back any amendment for a second referendum this week, but see the crunch point at the next opportunity \u2013 likely to be the next meaningful vote on the Brexit deal that May has promised to hold by 12 March.\nIt is highly unlikely Labour\u2019s amendment on its own Brexit deal will pass on Wednesday, making it almost inevitable the party will move to back another referendum.\nCorbyn told MPs that Labour \u201ccannot and will not accept\u201d May running down the clock towards no deal. \u201cOne way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May\u2019s overwhelmingly rejected deal,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.\u201d\nYet recriminations came from leave-supporting Labour MPs almost immediately in the private meeting on Monday night. John Mann, a Brexit supporter, said the decision to back a second referendum would cost Labour in the Midlands and the north. \u201cThe price will stop you being prime minister,\u201d he told the meeting.\nOutside the meeting, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said he had \u201cdeep reservations\u201d about the possibility of a second referendum and suggested it would not pass the House of Commons.\n\u201cI think it would be deeply divisive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,\u201d he said.\nIt is understood that about a dozen shadow ministers could consider their positions if Labour whips MPs to back a second referendum.\nThose who vocally oppose a second referendum include the shadow justice minister Gloria de Piero, the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn and shadow education minister Tracy Brabin as well as backbenchers including Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy.\nSeventeen Labour MPs, including eight shadow ministers, voted against or abstained on Cooper\u2019s previous amendment to extend article 50 last month.\nFuture Labour support for a second referendum could come in the form of backing for a proposed amendment to the meaningful vote proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.\nThat proposal would approve May\u2019s deal subject to a fresh referendum, though senior Labour officials are thought to be uneasy about backing any amendment that endorses the Tory Brexit deal.",

I\u2019m grateful for the time I spent with him and for the gentle beauty he shared with us.\u201d\nWith Hollis as its singer and creative mastermind, the group made a name with 1980s hit singles such as It\u2019s My Life, Today, Talk Talk and Life\u2019s What You Make It. They progressed to albums like Spirit of Eden, which was hailed as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d, and Laughing Stock.\nHis cousin-in-law Anthony Costello tweeted on Monday: \u201cRIP Mark Hollis. Cousin-in-law. Wonderful husband and father. Fascinating and principled man. Retired from the music business 20 years ago but an indefinable musical icon.\u201d\nTalk Talk\u2019s bassist Paul Webb, aka Rustin Man, paid tribute to Hollis on Instagram. \u201cI am very shocked and saddened to hear the news of the passing of Mark Hollis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMusically he was a genius and it was a honour and a privilege to have been in a band with him. I have not seen Mark for many years, but like many musicians of our generation I have been profoundly influenced by his trailblazing musical ideas.\u201d\nIn an interview with Q\u2019s backpages at the time, later republished in the Guardian, Hollis expressed awareness that he could be \u201ca difficult geezer\u201d but that was because he refused to \u201cplay that game\u201d that came with the role of musician in the spotlight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a reaction to the music that\u2019s around at the moment, \u2018cos most of that is shit,\u201d Hollis also said of Spirit of Eden. \u201cIt\u2019s only radical in the modern context. It\u2019s not radical compared to what was happening 20 years ago. If we\u2019d have delivered this album to the record company 20 years ago they wouldn\u2019t have batted an eyelid.\u201d\nHollis released his first and only solo album, also called Mark Hollis, in 1998. When asked about his decision not to tour anymore or maintain a public persona, he said: \u201cI choose for my family. Maybe others are capable of doing it, but I can\u2019t go on tour and be a good dad at the same time.\u201d He later retired from the music industry, and was little heard from publicly. An article about him last year was headlined \u201cHow to disappear completely.\u201d\nHis last known music was created for TV drama Boss starring Kelsey Grammer and TI.\nHollis\u2019 influence has often been referenced by musicians, including Elbow\u2019s Guy Garvey. \u201cMark Hollis started from punk and by his own admission he had no musical ability,\u201d he told Mojo. \u201cTo go from only having the urge, to writing some of the most timeless, intricate and original music ever is as impressive as the moon landings for me.\u201d Bands including Broken Social Scene, The The, Doves and Mansun have all paid tribute on Twitter.\n This article was amended on 26 February 2019. Talk Talk\u2019s bassist is Paul Webb, not Mark as we had it in an earlier version. This has been corrected.",

        "content": "Owen Farrell\u2019s kicking game was not enough in Cardiff and Eddie Jones missed a trick in ignoring the Leicester fly-half\nEngland had a plan B against Wales \u2013 the problem was it stayed on the bench. Owen Farrell is one of the best fly-halves in the world, if not the best, but everyone has off days and he just did not seem to have a feel for the game. We did not see adaptability from England \u2013 if one thing is not working, then try something else \u2013 and George Ford could have made all the difference.\nDo not get me wrong, England have a very strong game-plan. It is based around kicking, it suits the way they play, it suits their strong defence, set piece and power, everyone buys into it and it is their way of winning Six Nations matches. I understand exactly what they are trying to do but you need an ability to say, \u2018You know what, our kicking hasn\u2019t been on point\u2019 \u2013 it is not going to be 100% of the time \u2013 and you look to what else you have in the bag. With 15-20 minutes to go it was time to bring Ford on and try something different to unlock the Wales defence.\nWales were very good defensively, very well organised by Jonathan Davies in the wide channels and as a result we did not see space opening up out there as we did against France and a little bit against Ireland. Manu Tuilagi had one brilliant run but England needed more of it, Henry Slade was very strong defensively but not involved in the game and the back three were spectators to what was going on inside.\nWhen I say that Farrell did not have a feel for the game, he just seemed a bit too wedded to the kicking strategy. On the few occasions that England made dents with their powerful runners, when they did get on top, that was when Farrell needed to keep playing. You have a look to see where it goes, maybe it forces a penalty, maybe it leads to another linebreak but what we saw too often was another kick and it was obviously not working.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\nThat led to frustration, the penalty count started to creep up and that was when Ford needed to be introduced. He has a bit more of an attacking mind-set and England would have benefited from that change of direction, just as Wales did when Dan Biggar came on.\nEngland did not play particularly badly. It was a game of fine margins. But there was room to play a bit more when they got in behind. Instead they backed their kicking game, which worked perfectly in the first two matches but will never be perfect every time. Rugby just is not like that and even the All Blacks have to adapt if things are not going to plan. You do that by having different options on the bench and trusting them.\nWith Ford on the pitch, England could have moved the point of attack, which would have brought Slade into proceedings. Davies and Hadleigh Parkes defended very well but, when there are 60-70 minutes on the clock, force them to make more tackles on the outside \u2013 not just after four or five phases but 10 or 12. Wales clearly targeted Farrell and starved him of space but, if Ford comes on, Farrell shifts to 12 and you then have two playmakers on and he has that little bit more time on the ball. That takes a bit of pressure off Farrell and allows Ford to control the attacking side of things. Farrell still leads as he does but from a different role.\nThe thing with Ford is that you know he is going to move the ball. You still have Slade on the pitch, Elliot Daly, Farrell and Ben Youngs so you have plenty of kicking options as well as a more attacking mind-set, late in the game when there are a few soft shoulders and you tend to get over the gainline a little bit more. Keep playing, move the point of attack, move the Wales forwards around because they are going to be tired after a hell of a shift.\nFarrell is a world-class player but there is an expectation that these guys should be performing to their very best every single week. The game is so emotional at Test level and it takes a huge toll. England had that incredible performance in Ireland, then followed it up against France. Then you have a week off and it can often come at the wrong time. You are on such a high, then you all take a breath and then you have to come back up all over again. As Alun Wyn Jones said afterwards, Wales do not want this fallow week. They are on a roll, 12 wins in a row, and they want to keep those emotional levels high.\nWarren Gatland said it \u2013 Wales have forgotten how to lose and that is a great characteristic to have. They are like junkyard dogs, they scrap and fight for everything, Shaun Edwards has the defence very organised, they knew England were going to kick and they prepared for it. They exited on their terms, they won the aerial battle and they looked after the ball so much better than they did against France and Italy. They are the favourites now, the team to beat but that expectation brings a whole new set of pressures, from within and externally.",

Except, they weren\u2019t really.\nCity won the Premier League by a mile last year thanks to a run of sustained sublime form. But otherwise their season lost its dramatic tension on 4 April when City were eviscerated by Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final first leg, shrinking the scope of their ambitions to that near-perfect league season. Fast forward 10 months and Sunday\u2019s slow-burn victory in the Carabao Cup final has set up a fascinating point of contrast; one of those moments where the background noise starts to fall away and it makes sense, for the first time, to contemplate the wildly improbable.\nAll Or Not Quite Nothing would be a fair billing for the next three months, which are by comparison fretted with intrigue. City have a maximum of 20 matches left to play this season. In the course of which this team has a chance to add the three biggest trophies in English club football, a four-pronged feat that still looks an impossible stretch of luck, resources and the competing claims of every other club in the scrum for honours.\nMost things do not happen. This one will probably not either. But then very few have ever been this close or, indeed, so close with some key factors in their favour. It was notable when Pep Guardiola was asked about the prospect of a quadruple he did not roll his eyes and say \u201cfuck\u201d as he did two years ago, but instead dismissed the idea in more measured terms.\nNobody manages the details like Guardiola. He knows exactly where City stand. The squad is strong. The fixtures are tough but not impossible. City have won 13 of their last 15 games. So, for now, let\u2019s just take a moment to dream.\nStraight away City have an advantage on timing. The fixtures come thick but not that fast. If they can finish off Schalke in two weeks\u2019 time and get past Swansea in the FA Cup there is one obvious logjam to come. Between 6 April and 24 April City would play six high-pressure games in 19 days, a run that goes: FA Cup semi; Champions League quarter-final (first leg); Crystal Palace away; Champions League quarter-final (second leg); Tottenham at home; Manchester United away.\nGet through another flurry around the Champions League semi-finals and the season ends in fairly orderly fashion. Brighton away is the final Premier League fixture on 12 May. The FA Cup final is on 18 May. The distant prospect of a Champions League final would round things off on the first day of June.\nIt is an unusually well spaced-out endgame, and a favourable turn for any club caught in the familiar English slog through the spring. By comparison Manchester United\u2019s treble-winning season 20 years ago finished on 26 May, with United required to tie up three trophies in the final 10 days.\nThat United team played seven games in 26 days from the start of May. Should City get as far, they would end with four games in 28 days. Where does the advantage lie? United carried all before them in a glorious adrenal rush, with no time to look down or feel any fear. Could there be another kind of difficulty in that \u201ccold time\u201d between fixtures?\nThere are some more positive lessons to be learned along the way. United had seven different goalscorers in their last seven games, the burden shared as the line approached. And it is here that City also have deeper gears.\nThe only really worrying note is the injury sustained on Sunday by Fernandinho. John Stones\u2019s return from his hamstring twang will also be vital: Vincent Kompany is a great club servant but isolated against a player like Eden Hazard he wheels around like a passenger ferry with a wonky rear thruster these days.\nOn the plus side Bernardo Silva is in excellent shape, all non-stop ferreting intelligence on and off the ball. Left-back has looked like a problem but Oleksandr Zinchenko was magnificent at Wembley. Sergio Ag\u00fcero is in his absolute pomp right now. Raheem Sterling has five goals and four assists in 10 games, a man running hot at just the right time.\nComparisons are of course odious \u2013 and indeed meaningless given the complete re-gearing of every part of football\u2019s surfaces from year to year. But with 20 games to win them all, the question will naturally be asked as to where such an achievement would rank.\nSome will point to the thinning out at the very top, the fact fewer clubs are winning more trophies generally. But it would be incorrect to belittle this as a bought success, a triumph devalued by the extreme amounts of money involved.\nFor a start nobody wins anything these days without spending. That much is a given. Secondly this is above all a City team marked out by the more human elements. To miss the fact Guardiola has improved almost every one of his players, that the team has a system and a way of playing that is thrillingly well-grooved, that City have resisted the urge simply to buy ready-made world stars, is to miss the basic beauty of sport altogether.\nThe one area lacking is some sense of internal, organic growth. Every sporting triumph lacks a little something without an element of home-made talent. United\u2019s treble winners had seven academy products playing regularly in the first team. The greatest British European triumph of all, Celtic in 1967, saw Jock Stein pick a team drawn entirely from the Glasgow districts. City remains a portable project, all outsourced parts, and one that has yet to spawn a regular home-grown City player since the Abu Dhabi takeover. Such is the way of modern football elsewhere too. For now Sunday\u2019s cup final leaves this fine City team 20 games from a sporting feat that will most likely prove beyond them but which has never felt quite so close at hand.",

With Ben Stokes ruled out with a minor injury, Alex Hales, the reserve batsman, was due for a rare outing before the heavens opened.\nStokes was unsure he could bowl after rolling his ankle in training and Bayliss took a positive from the honesty on this occasion of a cricketer who often tries to play through the pain. But the all-rounder is expected to be fully fit for Wednesday\u2019s fourth fixture and will likely return with the five-match series still 1-1, reducing the scope for any rotation of personnel.\n\u201cOne of the things we wanted to do on this tour is not only win but, if we could, give everyone a run,\u201d said Bayliss. \u201cThe team that wins the World Cup will probably have the strongest squad. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get through close to a dozen games to win a World Cup with the same team. Your back-up strength will have to be up to speed. Not playing today\u2019s game is probably the only thing that\u2019s hampered that a little bit.\u201d\nThe value of Stokes to the balance of England\u2019s one-day team is immense, such that since the last World Cup no captain has used his sixth bowler more than Morgan. Bayliss insisted they are not over-reliant on this, pointing to the series win in Australia last year when he was unavailable for selection following the incident in Bristol.\nA lack of action in St George\u2019s \u2013 bar the steel band panning out some terrific calypso music and one member of the travelling support grabbing the microphone for an enthusiastic impression of Neil Diamond \u2013 also meant England\u2019s batsman have an extra couple of days waiting before they can atone for Friday\u2019s collapse in Barbados.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be a bit more ruthless,\u201d said Bayliss, reflecting on the loss of six for 35 in 47 deliveries. \u201cThat ruthlessness is something we\u2019vedone well over the last three or four years and that is why we\u2019re in the position we are in at the moment [ranked No 1].\n\u201cThe boys were talking in the changing room that it was a good reminder to them that they can\u2019ttake their foot off the pedal. While you\u2019d rather not have a loss, this one was a gentle reminder that we\u2019ve got to be on our game because there are plenty of teams out there capable of winning this World Cup. West Indies, with the size of their batters and the way some of them hit the ball, can be a chance.\u201d\nBayliss departs in September but after this current tour will see out the remainder of his contract without his long-standing No 2, Paul Farbrace. The pair have worked together since their time with Sri Lanka but after Farbrace secured a role as Warwickshire\u2019s new sporting director, Ashley Giles, who heads up the national team, opted not to hold him to his notice period.\nBayliss said: \u201cI feel disappointed for him that he\u2019s not going to be at the World Cup and the Ashes. But inthe cricket coaching world a job like the one he has taken on doesn\u2019t come up every day. He might be taking on another job but he\u2019s still young enough [51] that in a few years time he\u2019d be a candidate [for the role of England head coach].\u201d",

The unbeaten 30-year-old heavyweight, who learned his fighting skills as a teenager in Muay Thai and kick-boxing, was suspended for nine months and fined $2,500 in 2014 when he tested positive for the banned substance, dimethylamylamine, before turning to the gloved combat that has brought him a world title shot in his home city after 24 fights against varied opposition.\nMiller is clean as a boxer but reckons Joshua might not always have been \u2013 an allegation the champion denied, quietly but firmly. \u201cJarrell has been banned for drugs,\u201d Joshua said, \u201cso maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s saying it.\u201d\nMiller, keen to ramp up mutual animosity with Joshua, said: \u201cI study every opponent. My dad was a bodybuilder growing up; you can see it. I look at someone and I say, he\u2019s on steroids. Anybody who comes out of the amateurs at 220lbs and then is 240lbs in a year, there\u2019s something wrong with that picture.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to put on 20lbs of muscle within a year without taking some kind of supplement. It\u2019s impossible. I know bodybuilders train all year round, non-stop, and don\u2019t put on that amount of muscle.\n\u201cNow, if you look at his stature, while he\u2019s staying at this higher level, his physique has kinda shrunk.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve both got contracts in place where we\u2019re protected and the proper testing is going to be taking place, but it\u2019s written clear as day.\u201d\nJoshua smiled, but not for long, when Miller\u2019s claim was put to him. \u201cThat\u2019s a compliment,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause, if I was, I would not even be able to fit in this shirt. I dedicate myself to training, which you can see. I have applied myself properly and they are the results. I have been training since I was 18, so that\u2019s 11 years.\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking at my change between 2012 and 2013, but why doesn\u2019t he look at the 11 years? At the [London] Olympics I was around 104kg. Then, when I turned pro, I was around 107kg. Now I am 115kg, so that\u2019s 11kg in 11 years, it averages out. It\u2019s just my dedication. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to everyone because it\u2019s expensive, especially the food I drink and the lifestyle and training.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time this has happened, Wladimir Klitschko [whom Joshua beat in 2017] was accused of it. So, many fighters will be accused. But I get tested and, if, in the next 10 years, something was to come up then it would be a genuine mistake because I do not shove needles up my arse.\n\u201cI am on Adams [the Anti-Doping Administration & Management System] whereabouts. They have to know where I am for an hour every day. They can turn up any time during the day and that is a lifetime commitment. I have been on that since 2012 and I pay \u00a340,000 a fight to be tested twice a week. It\u2019s random drug-testing all year around.\u201d\nWhen they faced off for the first time in New York last week, Miller livened up proceedings for the cameras by pushing Joshua almost off his feet, but it did little more than alert the Watford fighter to the task ahead. The battle lines have been drawn and will stay that way, says Joshua.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really get along with the guys I fight and always find it weird that you can build up a fight and then kiss and cuddle after, even after saying all sorts of stuff for six or seven weeks. I don\u2019t really get involved in that.\u201d\nMiller brings an interesting back story to the fight \u2013 born in Brooklyn, raised intermittently in Belize, where he shared a house with 15 relatives \u2013 although fans will have to be convinced that he is good for anything more than a colourful quote.\nIt is difficult to dislike him and it will equally be hard to believe that any of the tough talk between now and fight night is anything more than part of the big sell.",

Watford have received compensation of about \u00a34m for their former manager, who sits four places and seven points beneath them having presided over an abysmal sequence of 10 defeats in 16 games with Everton.\n\u201cAll managers have to show results and show why the club signed him,\u201d Silva said, when asked whether he was in effect on trial at Everton for the final 11 games of the season. \u201cYou have to show the project, and show the idea, but in the end the main thing will be results.\n\u201cThe club has had four managers in the last 18 months and signed more than 20 players over maybe the last 18-20 months. Forget Marco Silva and the players we signed, it is not about the names; what we have to do is the right things and everyone is working in the club to take the right decisions.\u201d\nSilva admits that Everton\u2019s craving for stability cannot be the only factor keeping him in a job when results have been poor since December. Everton need to develop an identity as a team, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about stability but, if you have stability with good performances and more confidence in our players, then the good results will come together. Of course we are not happy with the recent form and I am the first one to say that. I understand our fans are not happy with these results. We didn\u2019t given them what they want and also what they deserve.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to talk about myself but stability is important. No one wants to have [a different] manager, manager, manager inside 20 months, and 20 players inside 18 months. You have to create something, an identity with our club, and you have to allow for some adaptation for this football, to adapt within our club and also to the Premier League. It is a special club and the players have to feel they can create an identity with our fans also.\u201d\nSilva gave his players time off during the recent break before working on \u201cthe details\u201d he believes have gone against his team in recent months. He explained: \u201cWe must be more competitive in some moments, keep more focus in other moments, be more aggressive and show that desire we showed earlier in the season to go against this bad run we have had in the last two months. Cardiff is a must-win, it is a game to win for sure, and like always I prepare the game to win.\u201d\nThe Everton manager is in regular communication with Moshiri. While a long break since defeat at Watford might have previously signalled time for managerial change under the billionaire, their latest meeting was upbeat and constructive according to Silva.\n\u201cThey were good talks,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you I am the first one to understand about the results but we were talking about the present and the future also. He passed to me and for our players the confidence he has in our work and in the players we have. Like me he believes we can achieve the results in the next games.\u201d",

Any immediate exit from Celtic by the 46-year-old would cause the Scottish champions an unforeseen problem at a key season juncture.\nNeil Lennon, who departed Hibernian in curious circumstances at the end of January, would be viewed as the most obvious candidate to return to Celtic and replace Rodgers in the short term at least.",

Turnout was 84.4%\nThe state had campaigned hard prior to the vote, casting a \u201cyes\u201d vote as an act of patriotism and a vote for the Revolution. TV, radio, posters, billboards and huge banners unfurled over public buildings urged the population to get out and vote. Even the electric ticker boards on buses chugging along Havana\u2019s main thoroughfares read \u201cI Vote Yes\u201d (\u201cYo Voto S\u00ed\u201d).\nBut the state was met with a surprisingly forceful challenge from an unofficial campaign against the new constitution.\nEvangelical churches concerned that the new constitution would create a pathway towards gay marriage hung banners reading \u201cmarriage: man + woman\u201d from church walls, while religious activists daubed posters on lamp posts \u2013 a direct challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly on public space.\nAlthough pastors did not explicitly call for a \u201cno\u201d vote, analysts say the church campaign mobilised non-religious, socially conservative sectors of the population to vote against the new constitution.\nAnd while state media gave no airtime or column inches to critical voices, #I\u2019mVotingNo (#YoVotoNo) hashtags were trending on Facebook.\nWhile older citizens said they voted to support the government, a younger generation of Cubans, particularly those living in the cities, are more daring.\nCuban journalist M\u00f3nica Rivero, 29, said: \u201cI think the new constitution is too conservative. It crystallises the status quo rather than making changes.\u201d\nIn Cuba\u2019s last referendum on a constitution in 1976, during the Cold War, 98% of ballots voted \u201cyes\u201d.\nVoting on the island is optional though strongly encouraged by the state and nosy neighbours. Cuba does not allow international observers to monitor its elections but citizens are allowed to watch the vote count at local polling stations.\nThe new constitution reaffirms the Communist Party as the only legitimate political party on the island, defines access to health and education as fundamental rights, and claims that humans can only \u201creach full dignity\u201d through \u201csocialism and communism\u201d.\nBut there are also big changes. The new constitution introduces presidential term limits and enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest.\nThe document also gives constitutional backing to cautious pro-market reforms carried out since 2011. Private property is recognised, the rights of multinationals investing with the state are strengthened, and the market is recognised as a fact of life.\nAnalysts estimate that one million Cubans now work in the private sector.\nEmily Morris, an economist from University College London, said the new constitution might open the path to stronger labour rights for those working in the island\u2019s non-state sector.\n\u201cWorker exploitation is already happening in the private sector,\u201d she said. \u201cBut recognising private enterprise could be a step forward by facilitating improved regulation of relationships between employers and employees.\u201d",

Longstaff\u2019s assurance on the ball, passing range and vision are currently keeping more senior midfielders, most notably Jonjo Shelvey, on the sidelines and Newcastle\u2019s manager awaits a call from St George\u2019s Park.\n\u201cSean wouldn\u2019t look out of place with England, there are not too many young English players with his quality,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI think he will go, he\u2019s doing well and playing in the Premier League. I like to see my players going to the national team. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the Under-20s, Under-21s or even the senior side but I think he needs to go one step at a time. If we start talking too much about how well it\u2019s doing, it\u2019s a risk.\u201d\nNot that Ben\u00edtez is overly worried about success going to Longstaff\u2019s head. \u201cSean\u2019s humble, professional and focused,\u201d he said before Tuesday night\u2019s home game against Burnley. \u201cHe\u2019s a player who can be consistent.\u201d\nHe also has an ideal opportunity to join up with Boothroyd\u2019s side for next month\u2019s friendlies against Poland and Germany at Bristol City and Bournemouth before challenging for a place in this summer\u2019s England Under-21 Championships in Italy and San Marino.\nThe only question mark against Longstaff is that, unusually, he has not progressed through England\u2019s junior development teams. \u201cSometimes you have players who aren\u2019t in the system but they develop later,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\n\u201cI saw Sean in training [for Newcastle\u2019s Under-23s] and I saw how good he was technically, he was doing right-foot, left-foot finishes into the bottom corner. His vision is good, there are just a few things he has to improve but he listens to us and is learning quickly. He\u2019s someone who is normally calm under pressure and that\u2019s a good thing for a midfielder.\u201d\nBen\u00edtez, meanwhile, is playing a resolutely straight bat in the face of suggestions that his name looms large in Leicester\u2019s plans as they seek a replacement for the sacked Claude Puel.\nNewcastle\u2019s manager is still to renew a contract which expires in May and will not agree to extend his stay on Tyneside until he gains certain assurances from the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, but, asked about Leicester\u2019s shortlist, his reply proved intriguing.\n\u201cShort? It\u2019s not very short, it\u2019s quite long now,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on our next games. We have to stay up and we have to stay focused.

They suggest this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners.\nBoth men and women who work on most or all weekends are more likely to become depressed than those who only work during the week, the research also found.\nThe results are based on data from more than 20,000 British adults taking part in Understanding Society: the UK household longitudinal study, which has been tracking family life and society since 2009.\nWomen who work at least 55 hours a week had 7.3% more likelihood of symptoms of depression than those who worked between 35 and 40 hours.\nWomen were also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday, though both were affected (4.6% and 3.4% more likely).\n\u201cWomen in general are more likely to be depressed than men, and this was no different in the study,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Gill Weston, a PhD student at University College London.\n\u201cIndependent of their working patterns, we also found that workers with the most depressive symptoms were older, on lower incomes, smokers, in physically demanding jobs, and who were dissatisfied with work.\u201d\nTwo-thirds of men work at weekends compared with half of women, according to the study, which has been published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.\nNHS Digital research has found that 19% of women in England suffer at some point from a common mental disorder \u2013 mainly anxiety or depression \u2013 and around 12% of men. Similarly, 10% of women and 6% of men display severe symptoms of either condition.\nWeston stressed that the authors\u2019 findings did not prove that long hours led directly to depression.\n\u201cThis is an observational study, so although we cannot establish the exact causes, we do know many women face the additional burden of doing a larger share of domestic labour then men, leading to extensive total work hours, added time pressures and overwhelming responsibilities,\u201d she said.\nAndy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: \u201cLong hours can be symptomatic of insecurity and unrealistic expectations at work, which are known risk factors for poor mental health. So the context in which a person is working long hours may be just as important as the time spent working.\u201d",

It has already begun stripping out seats even though the design for the new $730m stadium is yet to get through the planning process.\nLabor has accused the government of trying to lock in the decision to knock down the stadium before the election.\nIt has said that if it wins government it will make the Sydney Sports and Cricket Ground Trust borrow the funds rather than spend taxpayer\u2019s money and has suggested refurbishment might be a more appropriate option.\nThe decision has been deeply unpopular with Sydneysiders who have criticised the spending as profligate when schools and hospitals are in need of upgrades.\nThe stadium was opened in 1988 and is just 30 years old but the trust says it is not up to standard and requires a safety upgrade.\nLocal Democracy Matters spokesman Chris Maltby welcomed the injunction especially as there had been discussion in recent days in the case about removing the stadium\u2019s roof.\n\u201cIts excellent that we have got this far,\u201d he said and welcomed Waverley Council\u2019s decision to join the legal challenge.\n\u201cThe main issue here is will the government uphold its own planning laws.\u201d\nMaltby said the outcome was not necessarily dependent on the outcome of the case.\n\u201cWe hope the decision will be revisited in the backwash of the election: $700 and something million to build a stadium of the same size on the same site is just a terrible waste of money,\u201d he said.",

After returning to the sport and the national team set-up, she suffered the same injuries on her left knee in January last year. She returned to the W-League in December, proving her fitness during Sydney\u2019s run to the title, and is now likely to don a Matildas shirt.\nHarrison will link up with the rest of the squad in Sydney later on Tuesday after Milicic took charge of his first training sessions, during which he proved to the players he is a hard task master.\nMilicic oversaw his most intense Matildas session so far on Monday, with 23 players in camp after the late arrivals of Spain-based Matildas Alex Chidiac and Aivi Luik. The pair landed on Monday morning and by the afternoon, they were kicking out their jetlag in training, along with train-on youngster Allira Toby.\nKey defender Alanna Kennedy said the fresh eyes of a new coach meant going the extra mile to prove your worth. \u201c[Training has] been really tough but a really positive environment,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEvery session needs to be tough.

He masturbated himself while masturbating them. About one month later, as he passed one of the boys in a corridor of the church, Pell pushed the boy against a wall and forcefully squeezed his genitals.\nThe allegations had been the prosecution\u2019s to prove. Many of the witnesses called were now elderly. Former choirboys who gave evidence struggled to remember details about the choir procession and the church layout more than two decades after the fact. To convict Pell, the jury had to believe without doubt that the complainant was reliable and honest.\nThey did. Guilty was their response to all five charges after just over three days of deliberation. A courtroom that included about eight journalists, a Jesuit priest, a former Australian ambassador to the Vatican, and a handful of abuse advocates and Pell supporters sat stunned by the magnitude and import of those words.\nCardinal George Pell was guilty. On every count.\nThe trial in Melbourne, described as the \u201ccathedral trial\u201d, was not Pell\u2019s first.\nIn August he faced the county court on the same charges he was eventually convicted of. That trial lasted for almost five weeks and resulted in a hung jury. A mistrial was declared, with several of the jurors in tears as the forewoman told the court\u2019s chief judge, Peter Kidd, they could not come to either a unanimous or a majority 11-to-one verdict.\nA retrial began in November 2018 with a strict suppression order in place preventing any reporting of both the previous case and the retrial. That was because Pell faced further, separate, charges known as the \u201cswimmers trial\u201d in a case due to be heard this April.\nSuppression orders are common in child sexual abuse cases and this was no different. The order was lifted after so-called tendency evidence prosecutors were relying on using in the swimmers trial was on Friday deemed inadmissible by Kidd. Their chances of successfully prosecuting the case were significantly impeded, and on Tuesday they announced that the trial would be dropped. The suppression on the cathedral trial was then lifted.\nIt can now be revealed that Pell was convicted of four charges of an indecent act on a child under the age of 16, and one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16.\nThe prosecution, led by the crown barrister Mark Gibson, said those acts had occurred some time in the second half of 1996 after mass at the Melbourne cathedral, within months of Pell\u2019s inauguration as archbishop.\nTwo choirboys had finished their singing duties and decided to have some fun, the court heard. They slipped away from the choir procession as it exited the cathedral shortly after completing mass at noon, and made their way back into the building through the south-side entry. They walked down a corridor leading to the sacristies \u2013 the private rooms, off limits to the public, and used by priests and the archbishop to robe and disrobe in.\nIn the sacristy they found sacramental wine in an unlocked wooden cupboard, and each took a few swigs.\n\u201cWe were excited, feeling mischievous,\u201d the complainant, who cannot be named, told the court. \u201cI\u2019d never been in this room before.\u201d\nIt was then that Pell walked in, still in his robes.\n\u201cHe was alone. He planted himself in the doorway and said something like, \u2018What are you doing in here?\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re in trouble,\u2019\u201d the complainant said. \u201cThere was this moment where we all just sort of froze, and then he undid his trousers or his belt, like he started moving underneath his robes.\u201d\nPell pulled out his penis and approached the other boy, grabbing his head.\nThe complainant asked Pell, \u201cCan you let us go? We didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\u201cI could see his [the boy\u2019s] head being lowered towards his [Pell\u2019s] genitalia,\u201d the complainant recalled. \u201cThen he sort of started squirming, he was struggling. His head was being controlled and it was down near archbishop Pell\u2019s genitals. I was no more than a couple of metres away.\u201d\nThis took place for about a minute or two. Pell stopped and turned to the complainant.\n\u201cAnd then he put his penis into my mouth. Archbishop Pell was standing, he was erect, and he pushed it into my mouth. He instructed me to undo my pants and take off my pants, and I did that. And then he started touching my genitalia. Archbishop Pell was touching himself on his penis with his other hand.\u201d\nWhen it was over the complainant, in shock, pulled up his pants. The boys left the room and tried to rejoin the procession before returning their robes.\nAbout a month later, again after Sunday solemn mass, Pell passed the complainant in a corridor of the church and attacked. He pushed the boy against a wall and forcefully squeezed his genitals through his choir robes.\n\u201cNothing was said,\u201d the complainant said. \u201cIt was all within a matter of seconds.\u201d\nThe media and public were barred from being present during the complainant\u2019s evidence, as is standard in sexual assault cases to protect the victim from reliving their trauma in front of an audience.\nBut his police statement, made in June 2015, and his evidence to the court via video link were quoted throughout the trial. The other boy involved died in 2014 from a heroin overdose. He never reported the abuse to police.\nThe surviving complainant said it had taken him two decades to go to police because he had immediately pushed the attack to the \u201cdarkest recesses\u201d of his mind. Being in the choir was a condition of the complainant\u2019s competitive scholarship to attend St Kevin\u2019s College, an elite independent school in the affluent inner-Melbourne suburb of Toorak. His parents were going through a divorce, and his losing the scholarship would upset them.\n\u201cI knew a scholarship could be given or taken away even at that age,\u201d he told the court. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose that. It meant so much to me and my family. And what would I do if I said such a thing about an archbishop?\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I carried with me the whole of my life. I refrained from telling anyone. I was young and didn\u2019t really know what had happened to me. I didn\u2019t know what it was, if it was normal.\u201d\nIn his police statement, the complainant said he remembered Pell as \u201cbeing a big force in the place\u201d.\n\u201cHe emanated an air of being a powerful person. I\u2019ve been struggling with this a long time \u2026 and my ability to be here. Because I think Pell has terrified me my whole life \u2026 he was [later] in the Vatican. He was an extremely, presidentially powerful guy who had a lot of connections.\u201d\nProsecutors said the complainant was a believable witness who provided reliable evidence. They said the overall evidence from choirboys, altar servers, the choir master and master of ceremonies, Charles Portelli, about the layout of the church, and whether Pell would have the opportunity to offend, fitted with the complainant\u2019s account rather than discredited it.\nPell\u2019s defence was led by Robert Richter, a formidable defence barrister with a booming voice, known for his sometimes theatrical interrogation style. Previously he has successfully represented notorious underworld figures, and his legal team is estimated to have cost Pell about $50,000 a day.\nRichter told the jurors that the offences could not and did not happen.\nHe said the case against Pell was made up of improbabilities, which could only lead jurors to finding that the alleged offences were \u201cimpossible\u201d and defied common sense.\nThey were the product of \u201cfantasy\u201d, Richter said, because Pell had never been alone during mass while he was archbishop of Melbourne.\nRichter told the jurors Pell was always surrounded by people and accompanied by Portelli during Sunday solemn mass, which he described as a \u201cproduction\u201d involving dignitaries, congregants and tourists. This made it impossible that Pell could have abused two boys unnoticed, Richter said.\nAfter mass Pell would often stand on the church steps, meeting and greeting parishioners, witnesses confirmed. Portelli would then accompany him to the sacristies to help him disrobe. Some former church staff told the court the sacristy would be bustling after mass, with altar servers locking away precious vessels and chalices.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the Queen, I suppose, the Queen when she is robed is never unattended, she\u2019s not expecting to dress and get undressed on her own \u2026 there are always attendants and it\u2019s that sort of situation,\u201d Richter said.\nWhy would Pell risk abusing two boys in his first months in the high-profile role as Melbourne\u2019s archbishop, argued Richter and his assistant, the defence barrister Ruth Shann.\nIt was a time when the Catholic church was embroiled in scandal. Notorious paedophile priests including Gerald Ridsdale \u2013 once a friend of Pell\u2019s \u2013 had by then been convicted of more than 70 charges of abusing children.\nOnce anointed as archbishop in August 1996, Pell took action to address the scandals by announcing the Melbourne Response, the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne\u2019s program to address child sexual abuse allegations. The program has since been widely criticised by abuse survivors and their families.\nNonetheless, Richter said, Pell was a man doing his best to tackle abuse and would not have risked his reputation by abusing two boys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral as a new archbishop.\nIn the retrial, Richter resorted to using a PowerPoint presentation during his closing address to drill his point home, a move that surprised many in the courtroom. One slide flashed on the screen that simply read: \u201cOnly a madman would attempt to rape two boys in the priests sacristy immediately after Sunday solemn mass.\u201d\nKidd allowed the PowerPoint, but barred Richter from using a video animation during his closing address, saying it risked leading the jury to believe that what was being shown was fact, and new evidence was not allowed to be shown during closing addresses.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nPell was not mad, Richter told the jurors, but he would have to be if he had sexually assaulted two boys.\n\u201cThe next aspect of the madman theory is there is nothing to prevent one boy running screaming from the room while the other is under attack,\u201d he told them.\n\u201cHow would Pell know that was not going to happen? How would he know the other boy wouldn\u2019t be running out of the room, raising the alarm or running away in tears?\u201d\nIf Pell really wanted to abuse two boys, Richter added, he would have taken them to his private office after discovering them in the sacristy, where he could attack them behind a locked door. Richter told jurors it was unfathomable that the boys would not have spoken to each other or anyone else about the abuse afterwards .\n\u201cIt makes no sense because it did not happen,\u201d Richter said. It also made no sense that two boys could \u201cnick off\u201d from a procession and sneak back into the church unnoticed by other choirboys, church staff or adults.\n\u201cThe prosecution case is cherry picking bits of evidence saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s possible to do this, it\u2019s possible that this happened.\u2019 The crown case is built on speculation. You would not hang a chicken on that, let alone decide a man\u2019s fate.\u201d\nBut some of the choirboys gave evidence that the procession after mass was not always orderly and that they might not have noticed two of their number slipping away. Boys were keen to disrobe and leave. One choirboy said that once the choir had processed outside and reached a certain point, it was \u201cgame on\u201d.\nAnother former choirboy said once the procession had passed through the outside gate, children would relax and move out of line.\nGibson, the crown barrister, said no one remembered two boys \u201cnicking off\u201d because nobody had noticed them leave. It would only be remembered as a remarkable event had someone seen it, he said.\nBut Richter told jurors that even if two children managed to sneak back into the church after mass and enter the sacristy unseen, the sacristy would have been a \u201chive of activity\u201d, and the long-serving sacristan Max Potter would have been there. They would have been caught, he said.\nHe also told jurors to consider that Australia had no extradition treaty with the Vatican, and that Pell had returned to Australia to face trial of his own accord.\nThe battle between the defence and prosecution \u2013 between Richter and Gibson \u2013 gripped not only those in court, but also some outside.\nThat Pell was the most high-profile person in the Vatican to be charged with such offences at the time of his arrest was inescapable. Barristers from unrelated cases being heard in other courtrooms came in to listen.\nThroughout the first trial Pell sat in the dock, often writing notes as evidence was given. By the retrial in November, the notepad was largely gone, he was no longer able to sit and stand as the jury exited and entered owing to a knee problem, and he was using a walking cane to get around.\nAfter a couple of former church staff who gave evidence shook hands with Pell on their way out of the courtroom during the first trial, it was ordered that future witnesses walk to and from the stand, avoiding the dock \u2013 to prevent any interaction that might influence the jurors.\nWhen the court adjourned each day for lunch, Pell sat with his legal team, guarded by security staff, in a tiny meeting room adjacent to the courtroom, eating sausage rolls, milkshakes and sandwiches. He did not venture outside during breaks.\nJurors were selected from 250 people who came into the court during the empanelment process. Kidd was concerned that it would be difficult to find a group of impartial people who did not have biases towards or against Pell or the church. There were concerns about not having the requisite 12 for a verdict if jurors became sick during the lengthy five-week trial, leading to 14 jurors being selected.\nBefore jury deliberations, two jurors were balloted off. Four women and eight men remained, among them a church pastor and a secondary school teacher.\nIt was always going to be a tough case to prove. Not only were prosecutors grappling with the passage of time, but before he died in 2014 the other alleged victim told his mother he was never sexually abused. Prosecutors called about two dozen witnesses throughout the trial, many of them former choirboys, who had to try to conjure memories from their childhood and teenage years. Their responses to questioning were often \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t recall\u201d.\nIt meant that the prosecution pinned its case against Pell almost entirely on the evidence of one person \u2013 the complainant.\nIn his succinct but powerful closing remarks, Gibson asked the jury to consider how the complainant would have known the layout of the priest\u2019s sacristy, and that there were wooden panels, a storage cupboard, a kitchenette and sacramental wine in there. It was not a place choirboys were allowed to enter. Yet the complainant was able to describe the room.\n\u201cYou might ask yourselves how would he know that unless he was in there,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cHow does he know about the concealed alcove area without actually being there? How does he know it\u2019s a storage-kitchenette kind of thing and there being a wood-panelled area if he\u2019s not been in there?\n\u201cHow does [the complainant] know that that was where the wine was kept?\u201d\nHe asked jurors to consider the overall impression the complainant left them with.\n\u201cDid he strike you as an honest witness? In our submission he was not a person indulging in a fantasy or inventing things to a point where he now believes his own inventive mind. He was simply someone telling it how it was and is. A person genuinely recounting events experienced as a 13-year-old through the eyes of a 34-year-old.\u201d\nFor his part, Richter told jurors that this was a trial of a high-profile man who should not be be forced to take the blame for the failings of the organisation he helped to lead.\n\u201cYou would have had to live on the moon to not be aware of it,\u201d Richter had told jurors. \u201cArchbishop Pell was portrayed as the Darth Vader of the Catholic church.\u201d\nThe failings of the Catholic church and accusations that church leaders failed children, combined with Pell\u2019s profile, was \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d, he said.\nBut he added: \u201cThis is not a trial of the Catholic church. Cardinal Pell is not here to answer for failings of various clerics. This is a trial of Cardinal Pell for performing abominable acts.\u201d\nKidd, a judge respected by both parties who was firm and thorough throughout the trial, told the jurors from the start: \u201cYou, of course, will always bear in mind it\u2019s for the prosecution to prove its case \u2026 from beginning to end. And the defence does not need to prove anything.\u201d\nIn his directions to jurors before they retired to deliberate, Kidd told them to keep in mind that Pell\u2019s defence team were at a significant forensic disadvantage because so much time had passed.\n\u201cThis is not an opportunity to make Cardinal Pell a scapegoat for the failures of the Catholic church,\u201d Kidd told them.\n\u201cYou may believe all, none or some of the witnesses\u2019 evidence. Don\u2019t look for hints from me. I\u2019m not going to give you any. I absolutely assure you of that. My role is not to express a view one way or another about the guilt or not of the accused man.\u201d\nIn the end the jury\u2019s view was clear.\nAfter the verdict, and as shock spread throughout the room, Kidd thanked the jurors for their service. \u201cI for one strongly believe in the jury system, I think it\u2019s really important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly challenging, especially in an intense case like this.\u201d\nHe agreed to allow Pell to undergo knee reconstruction surgery, but said the cardinal would be remanded in custody when he returned to court for sentencing on 27 February.\nThroughout the trial Pell was driven in a private car, with a police escort waiting each day to quickly whisk him inside and back out.\nHis next police escort will be to prison.",

        "content": "Only a fraction reported the incidents to their university or the police, study finds\nSexual misconduct is rife at UK universities, with more than half of students saying they have experienced unwanted advances and assault, ranging from explicit messages to rape, research shows.\nBut a survey of 5,649 students, for the charity Brook and the student database Dig-In, found that only a fraction of those affected reported the incidents to their university or the police, and many admitted a lack of understanding of what legally constitutes sexual harassment and violence.\nIn the study, conducted in January, 56% of respondents said they had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour, including inappropriate touching, explicit messages, catcalling, being followed, and being forced into sex or sexual acts.\nOverall, 8% of respondents said they reported these incidents to the police or their university, including only a quarter of students who said they were raped or forced into other sexual acts.\nNearly half (49%) of the women surveyed said they had been touched inappropriately but only 5% reported it. A quarter (26%) of women said they had been sent unwanted sexually explicit messages but only 3% reported it.\nMore than half (53%) of respondents said the perpetrator of the unwanted sexual behaviour was another student. Almost a third (30%) of the reported incidents took place on campus.\nThe study found that women were far more likely than men to experience unwanted sexual behaviour, with only 3% of men reporting they had been touched inappropriately. Nearly two-thirds of female respondents who reported they did not feel confident in saying no to sex said this was due to fear it might lead to violence.\nThe survey, the largest conducted on sexual violence and harassment at UK universities, also identified a significant gap in students\u2019 understanding of consent and what constitutes sexual harassment and violence.\nOnly 15% of those surveyed said unwanted sexual behaviour counted as sexual harassment, and only half (52%) said they understood that someone could not consent to sex if they were drunk.\nHelen Marshall, the chief executive of Brook, a young people\u2019s sexual health and wellbeing charity, said schools and universities were failing young people if they did not know that the law protected them from unwanted sexual behaviour.\nShe called for better relationships and sex education in schools, noting that only half of respondents said they had received information on consent and less than a third were informed about what constitutes harassment.\nMarshall added: \u201cThis worryingly low reporting rate suggests that much more needs to be done at every stage of academic life. It\u2019s really important that universities provide students with information and education on sexual harassment and the law, and ensure that their reporting procedures and support services are accessible and welcoming.\u201d\nDr Anna Bull, the co-founder of the 1752 Group, which was set up to address staff-student sexual harassment in higher education, said the study confirmed \u201ca pattern of high levels of sexual harassment and violence experienced especially by female students, but with low levels of reporting to the police or to the institution\u201d.\nShe said that despite many universities changing the way they handled sexual misconduct, \u201cthere remains a huge amount of work to be done to effectively prevent and respond to it\u201d.\nA spokeswoman for Universities UK said numerous universities ran consent classes for students. \u201cUUK continues to work with the sector and will publish recommendations in the spring on what further action is necessary to drive improvement in this important agenda,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cSexual violence and harassment is illegal and can have a devastating impact on its victims. These crimes should always be reported to the police.\n\u201cWe have asked Universities UK to establish a sexual violence and harassment taskforce specifically to tackle the issue in higher education, and have tasked the Office for Students to work with universities to implement its recommendations.\n\u201cIssues such as these are exactly why just yesterday the education secretary pressed ahead with plans to update sex education guidance for schools for the first time in nearly two decades. We are also introducing relationships education to ensure all children are taught about healthy, respectful relationships and can recognise, seek help and report inappropriate behaviour, harassment, abuse or exploitation.\u201d\nA third-year undergraduate student at a university in Leeds made a complaint in the summer of 2018 after she alleged that another student raped her. \u201cI had bruises and cuts all over my chest and back,\u201d she said. She also sustained a vaginal tear and internal bleeding.\nThe student said the lecturer who investigated her complaint asked her how much she had been drinking before the alleged assault, leaving her feeling further distress and humiliation.\nThe university informed the student there was insufficient evidence to substantiate her complaint. Although the university said her alleged attacker would be barred from being in the same building as her when she was in the department, this restriction did not cover other areas of the campus, including the library and cafe.\nShe said: \u201cI have since seen him on campus four times and I have had severe panic attacks each time. The first time I ran away and it took me half an hour to stop hyperventilating.\u201d\nFrustrated with the university\u2019s handling of her complaint, the student went to the police last autumn. She said: \u201cThe police took me more seriously. The officer interviewed me for two hours and has taken the statements of several witnesses.\u201d\nThe student said the university refused her request to suspend her alleged attacker while the police investigation was ongoing. She was reluctant to appeal against the university\u2019s investigation because \u201cit\u2019s been an absolutely humiliating process\u201d.",

Funding on this basis fell by 37% overall in greater London.\nNationally, funding per child fell by 32% although there were regional variations, including signs of a north\u2013south divide. The north-east, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the north-west experienced per-head funding cuts of 33%, with cuts as high as 45% in Manchester, 43% in Nottingham and 42% in Birmingham.\nThis measured against 25% in the south-east region, with per-child cuts over the same 2010-2018 period as comparatively low as 18% in Devon, 19% in Hampshire and 20% in Surrey \u2013 although the study pointed out that no regions had escaped significant funding reductions.\nOf the 40 English authorities with the biggest government per-head cuts to children\u2019s services, 36 are controlled by Labour. Funding in the most deprived authorities fell almost twice as fast as in the least deprived councils, even though the poorest areas had higher numbers of children taken into care.\nThe research found:\n Council spending on early intervention services for children including Sure Start centres and youth clubs fell by 49% to \u00a31.9bn since 2012. More than 1,000 children\u2019s centres and 600 youth clubs have closed. Spending on disabled children fell 11%.\n There was a 12% increase in spending on late intervention, fuelled by a 17% increase in the number of children in care since 2010. Child protection and youth justice spending also soared, a trend that was \u201cunlikely to change in the near future\u201d, the charities said.\nThe minister for children and families, Nadhim Zahawi, said: \u201cWe want every child to have the best start in life, with the opportunities and the stability to fulfil their potential, which is why we have made \u00a3200bn available to councils up to 2020 for local services, including those for children and young people.\u201d\nEmma Lewell-Buck, Labour\u2019s minister for children and families, said: \u201cThis report should be a wake-up call to the government. With cuts set to continue while demand rises, more children will lose out on these vital services, and the devastating impact of austerity will be felt in the most vulnerable communities for years to come.\u201d\nStuart Gallimore, the president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s services, said demand for services had risen in tandem with child poverty, and poorer families struggled to afford necessities such as food and clothes: \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong but this doesn\u2019t sound like a country that works for all children.\u201d\nBarnardo\u2019s chief executive, Javed Khan, said: \u201cIn every community children face growing challenges \u2026 and in many areas the services they once relied on just aren\u2019t there any more. As a result, far too often families are reaching crisis point \u2013 with rising numbers of children being taken into local authority care.\u201d\nThe research comes amid concern long waits for youth mental health services, school budget cuts and growing demand for services for youngsters with special educational needs and disabilities. Councils have said financial pressures caused by rising demand for children\u2019s services threaten to tip town halls into bankruptcy.",

And I was told, no, they\u2019re not for me, that\u2019s for the hard-working backroom people in [TV production company] Boundless \u2013 one of whom was an accountant, believe it or not.\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s about time that Bafta started to recognise the show as a major contributor to business on television \u2013 in a similar manner to Simon Cowell [who received Bafta\u2019s special award in 2010]. I think Bafta should recognise me for my great contribution to business, and give me one of these awards.\u201d\nSugar, who made hundreds of millions of pounds from electronics and property, repeatedly complained about the perceived slight, especially after Young Apprentice, the youth version of the show, won in 2012.\n\u201cHonestly, it was really frustrating \u2013 more so for my wife than myself. She couldn\u2019t understand it. She knew how hard I fought to get the Junior [Apprentice] done. And then we go to the ceremony, it wins, and she goes: \u2018Where\u2019s your award?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, I don\u2019t get one.\u2019 Unbelievable. Unbelievable.\u201d\nSugar complained that when he did an interview with the BBC about the Bafta win he couldn\u2019t pose with his own statue. \u201cSo I borrowed it from one of these people that won it, and they had a motorbike sitting outside my house in case I stole it. They wanted me to give it straight back. It\u2019s unbelievable. Unbelievable.\u201d\nThe businessman gave the interview to the Radio Times to promote the first series of The Celebrity Apprentice in a decade. The charity show, which has been filmed for Comic Relief, features the former England football manager Sam Allardyce, broadcaster Rachel Johnson, and TV presenter Rylan Clark-Neal.\nSugar was made a Labour peer when Gordon Brown was prime minister but quit the party after the 2015 general election.\nHe has repeatedly threatened to leave the country if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister and also used the Radio Times interview to suggest the Labour leader is a Trotskyite who would put \u201cstatues of pseudo-Lenin in Trafalgar Square\u201d.\nThe choice of statues in Trafalgar Square is a matter for the mayor of London, rather than Downing Street. It is unclear what Sugar meant by \u201cpseudo-Lenin\u201d.",

Of those, more than half \u2013 an estimated 2.3 million patients \u2013 have to pay prescription charges, which are currently \u00a38.60 per item.\nThree-quarters (76%) of them have trouble affording that, according to Asthma UK\u2019s survey of more than 9,000 people with the disease. And almost six in 10 of those who pay \u2013 1.3 million people \u2013 said they had not taken medication when they should have in order to save money.\n\u201cAsthma is a serious condition that kills three people every day in the UK and the best way for people to stay well is to take their life-saving medication, often for their entire life,\u201d said Dr Samantha Walker, the charity\u2019s director of research and policy.\n\u201cWhen people are struggling financially they may feel they simply cannot afford to pay for the medication. By not taking it they are at risk of being hospitalised or even dying from an asthma attack.\u201d\nMany asthmatics use a preventer inhaler every day to reduce the risk of a flare-up and also carry a reliever inhaler in case they have trouble breathing in an attack. Some also need to take an anti-allergy medication or antibiotics for a chest infection.\nAsthma prescriptions typically cost \u00a3100 a year, but can be as much as \u00a3400, research suggests.\nAsthma UK is urging ministers to add the disease to the list of conditions for which sufferers in England do not have to pay for their medication.\n\u201cIt is unfair that people with asthma have to pay for their prescriptions to stay alive, especially as people with other long-term conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy, and those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland get free prescriptions,\u201d it says.\nAlmost everyone earning less than \u00a320,000 a year struggles to afford their asthma drugs, it said.\nPeople with diabetes, epilepsy, cancer and hyperthyroidism already get their medications free on the NHS.

Even in February, the airport processes as many as 10 planes from the UK in a single hour. In total, 2.9 million British passport holders go through the airport each year.\nPortugal plans special UK lanes at Faro airport in the Algarve and Funchal, the capital of Madeira, to provide fast-track access for British passport holders, irrespective of a Brexit deal or no deal, but Spain has yet to formally reveal its position.\nRory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said: \u201cAirports can be chaotic at the best of times but if additional checks at passport control are implemented in the event of a no-deal, it seems that very long queues are going to be an unwanted side effect.\n\u201cUntil there is a deal or these airports announce simpler arrangements, you should consider what you may need if you have to fly to them, as it is very likely that you\u2019ll be in a queue for several hours. Make sure you have food, water and essentials for kids like nappies to hand.\u201d\nThe Which? analysis of queues and processing time was based on data from the European Tourism Association (ETOA).\nThe official UK government advice in the event of no deal is that British tourists will have no right to use the separate lanes for EU, EEA and Swiss nationals, may be asked to show a return or onward ticket and may face checks to ensure they have sufficient funds for the duration of their visit.\nAena, Spain\u2019s biggest airport operator, said it did not envisage chaos at airports this summer because too much was at stake. It said: \u201cAena does not consider that the most pessimistic scenario will occur.

        "content": "The Australian cardinal faces a jail sentence after a suppression order on his conviction for child sexual assault was lifted\n Follow live updates on the reaction to Cardinal George Pell\u2019s conviction\n Full report: Pell found guilty of child sexual assault\n Five times guilty: how Pell\u2019s past caught up with him in courtroom 4.3\n Dozens of journalists accused of breaking Pell suppression order face possible jail terms\nPell is essentially the treasurer of the Vatican and the Holy See in Rome, a high-ranking position that makes him among the world\u2019s most powerful Catholics. He has also been a longtime confidant to Pope Francis. Before his appointment to the Vatican in 2014, Pell held senior positions within the Catholic church in Australia, including as the archbishop of Sydney and the archbishop of Melbourne. He is known for his staunch conservativism on issues including marriage equality and abortion.\nHe is Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic. He was made a companion in the Order of Australia in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours in 2005 for his service to the church. Pell is now also the highest-ranking Catholic official in the world to have been convicted of child sexual abuse.\nPell has attracted criticism since the 1990s for the way he responded to allegations of child sexual abuse while he was working in Australian Catholic institutions. As archbishop of Melbourne he formulated the much-criticised Melbourne Response, which offered support and counselling to victims of sexual abuse but capped compensation payments. In 2014 he said the church was no more responsible for child abuse carried out by church figures than a trucking company would be if they employed a driver who molested women. At Australia\u2019s child sex abuse royal commission, he described offending by his one-time friend, the priest Gerald Ridsdale, as a \u201csad story\u201d that \u201cwasn\u2019t of much interest to me\u201d. Ridsdale has been found guilty of offending against more than 60 children.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nIn June 2017 Pell was charged with child sexual assault offences by Australian police.\nPell took leave from the Vatican and stood aside from his position there to return to Australia and face a committal hearing, which began in March 2018. In a committal hearing, a magistrate decides if there is enough evidence to go to trial. The magistrate threw out the most serious charges owing to credibility issues of witnesses. Other charges were withdrawn by prosecutors.\nPell was left facing several charges, which were split into two trials. The first group related to offending in 1996 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne when he was archbishop. The second group related to alleged offending in a swimming pool while he was a priest in the regional Victorian town of Ballarat in the 1970s.\nThe cathedral trial was held in August and resulted in a hung jury. A mistrial was declared and the trial was held a second time, beginning in November. On 11 December the jury returned a verdict of guilty on five charges; one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and four counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of 16. The convictions relate to Pell\u2019s offending against two 13-year-old choirboys.\nA suppression order was in place so that jurors in the trial of the second group of alleged offences would not be prejudiced by reporting of the first trial. Such suppression orders are standard when an accused person is facing multiple trials. But the swimming pool charges were dropped by prosecutors on Tuesday after evidence they were relying on to build their case was deemed inadmissible by the judge, Peter Kidd. With Pell no longer facing a further trial, the suppression order was lifted and the cathedral trial and mistrial can now be reported in full.\nPell\u2019s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, has indicated that his client will appeal. Usually, a single judge considers the appeal application and decides whether the accused has legal grounds for appealing. If there are grounds for appeal, the matter proceeds to a hearing.\nIf the judge refuses the application, a convicted person can elect to have the refusal reconsidered by other judges of the court of appeal. If the matter goes to a hearing and the conviction is set aside, the court may order a new trial, or acquit the person. The process can take eight to 10 months, sometimes longer.\nIn the meantime, Pell is due to be sentenced next week, but may be taken into custody at a plea hearing on Wednesday. He was granted bail in December to undergo knee surgery, which he has since had.\nNow that the trial is over, the royal commission may release its findings relating to Pell. When the five-year inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse delivered its final report in 2017, the section relating to Pell was redacted so as not to prejudice court proceedings.\nThe Vatican will have been made aware of the verdict when it was delivered in December. A Vatican spokesman has consistently said the pope does not intend to speak until the judicial process is complete, including a possible appeal.\nTwo days after the verdict, Pope Francis removed Pell from his inner circle in a restructure of his Council of Cardinals. Pell was not removed from his position as financial controller of the Vatican, a position he technically still holds. On Pell\u2019s removal from the council, Francis thanked him for his work reforming the Vatican bureaucracy.\nThere will be pressure on the Vatican to respond to Pell\u2019s verdict quickly, given growing global anger about the way the church has responded to and concealed child sexual abuse. Last week\u2019s landmark child sexual abuse summit at the Vatican drew criticism after Francis failed to promise a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to paedophiles and those who cover up their crimes.",

On 11 December 2018 a jury before Melbourne\u2019s county court convicted him on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16.\nOnce Pell had read his statement, prepared with the assistance of his solicitors, Det Chris Reed attempted to begin his questioning. Reed told Pell a former choirboy had alleged that Pell had exposed his penis to him after mass.\n\u201cOh, stop it,\u201d Pell interjected. \u201cWhat a load of absolute and disgraceful rubbish.

It had been alleged Pell orally raped one of the boys, forcing his penis into his mouth, and that he had also performed indecent acts on them.\nPell, sucking on sweets throughout the interview, repeatedly interrupted Reed to confirm: \u201cThis is after mass?\u201d and \u201cThis is in the sacristy at the cathedral after Sunday mass?\u201d When Reed confirmed that was the allegation, Pell replied: \u201cThat\u2019s good for me, because it makes it even more fantastic and impossible.\n\u201cThe most rudimentary interview of staff and those who were choirboys at the cathedral in that year and later would confirm the allegations are fundamentally improbable and most certainly false.\u201d\nAt times, Pell scoffed as Reed outlined the allegations. \u201cWhat a load of garbage and falsehood, and deranged falsehood,\u201d he said.\nAt the end of the roughly 45-minute interview, Pell was asked if he had anything more to say in answer to possible charges that might be laid.\n\u201cThat I\u2019m certainly not guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe on many, many details I\u2019ve been able to prove that the charges are false and I believe with more work and information we\u2019ll be able to further enhance the strength of those denials.\u201d",

But for the president, Hassan Rouhani, the departure of such a close ally at a time of prolonged intense political pressure will be a serious blow.\nIt will be the reaction of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, which will determine Zarif\u2019s fate. He has threatened to resign before as the nuclear deal came under sustained criticism by hardliners, but never so publicly.\nZarif is quoted in the Iranian media as saying that the immediate cause of his abrupt offer to resign, announced in the middle of the night on Instagram, was the fact that he was not invited to meet Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator visited Tehran on Monday. By some accounts he was not even informed in advance about the visit.\nThe news website Entekhab quoted him as referring to himself in the third person and saying \u201cafter the pictures of the meetings today, Javad Zarif has no credibility in the world as a foreign minister.\u201d\nPolicy in Syria is largely run by the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and its leader Qassem Suleimani, but Zarif has participated in meetings with Assad before, and his exclusion from invitation list seems to be a clear snub. It also appears to signal a downgrading of the importance of the foreign ministry and its advocacy of openness to the world and keeping faith with the nuclear deal.\nSince Donald Trump took the US out of the multilateral agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), by which Iran accepted severe constraints on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, there has been a rising chorus of calls in Iran for it to cease abiding by the deal\u2019s restrictions.\nThe European states who were party to the agreement \u2013 the UK, France, Germany and Russia \u2013 along with China have urged Tehran to stick with the agreement, and have tried to devise ways of bypassing US sanctions.\nHowever, the threat of secondary US sanctions on any companies trading with Iran has been enough to scare most foreign investors and traders out, robbing Iran of any substantial benefits from the deal.\nJamal Abdi, the head of the National Iranian-American Council, a pro-diplomacy advocacy group, said \u201cZarif\u2019s resignation is a boon for the radical hardline forces in Tehran who oppose the JCPOA and further engagement with the West. While Zarif is not above criticism, over the past forty years, the US and Iran have had few clear channels for negotiations, and Zarif has long been a major proponent of US-Iran negotiations and deescalation. Trump\u2019s plan to collapse the nuclear deal may indeed be aimed at empowering radicals in Iran.\u201d",

        "content": "Jane Bell given administrative appeals tribunal role three days before unsuccessfully contesting preselection\nChristian Porter appointed a Liberal party member to a lucrative government job just three days before she unsuccessfully contested preselection for the Victorian federal seat of Higgins.\nOn Thursday the attorney general appointed lawyer Jane Bell to the administrative appeals tribunal, along with 14 other former Coalition parliamentarians and staffers, including his own former senior adviser William Frost.\nOn Sunday Bell, a solicitor for 22 years, board member of Monash Health and deputy chair of Biomedical Research Victoria, lost the Higgins preselection to paediatrician Katie Allen. Bell got a part-time position at the AAT while Frost was appointed full-time, a position that attracts a $244,000 salary.\nThe Coalition has come under fire from Labor for stacking the tribunal, which has wide-ranging powers to review government and administrative decisions in areas including appeals against robodebts and asylum applications.\nThe latest crop of appointments led the Law Council of Australia to renew calls for a transparent, merit-based process because of fears the tribunal\u2019s independence and integrity would be compromised.\nOf the 34 new appointments announced on Thursday, six were former Coalition parliamentarians and eight were former Coalition staffers, including Frost, a senior adviser to Porter from 2015 to 2019 during his stints as social services minister and attorney general. Just one former Labor MP, David Cox, was appointed.\nPorter told Guardian Australia that Bell had nominated for Higgins \u201cafter the substantive preselection process but before her final appointment\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no reason why a person during the selection and appointment process for the AAT is not able to nominate for a preselection or commence other employment application processes, if that is their wish,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn this case, Ms Bell was not successful so it has no impact on her ability to take up the AAT role.\u201d\nPorter said Frost was \u201can experienced lawyer and there is no question that he\u2019s an outstanding candidate for the position, bringing extensive legal knowledge and practical experience in administrative law\u201d.\n\u201cLabor appointed a number of its former staff to roles within the AAT and the latest round of appointments announced by me last week includes the reappointment of some of those staff and, indeed, the new appointment of a former Labor parliamentarian.\u201d\nOn Monday Porter told 6PR radio he was keen to appoint \u201cpeople who would reflect community values in migration decisions, because we have had a very large number of ministerial migration decisions overturned by the AAT\u201d.\nHe cited the independent tribunal\u2019s decision to overturn 39% of migration cases, more than 4,000 in the past year.\nThe home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has been pushing to restrict the AAT\u2019s powers of review, claiming that it is out of step with community standards in overturning departmental cancellations of visas on character grounds.\nOn Friday the Law Council president, Arthur Moses SC, said the legal profession was concerned and troubled by the latest round of appointments.\n\u201cThe independence and integrity of the AAT depends on an apolitical, open and merit-based appointment system,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s announcement of 34 new appointments to the AAT made without community consultation and 52 reappointments for existing members is concerning.\u201d\nMoses cited the number of reappointments of existing members \u201cwell before the expiry of their current terms\u201d.\n\u201cIn the context of an upcoming federal election, [this] may give rise to a reasonable apprehension that decisions are affected by political considerations and therefore compromises the reputation of the tribunal.\u201d\nThe shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has accused the Coalition of a \u201cshameful record\u201d of stacking the tribunal by making 86 appointments \u201cfull of Liberal mates\u201d.\nOn Monday Porter was forced to defend the appointment of the former Western Australian Liberal MP Joe Francis, and deny that Francis had provided free campaign buses to the Liberal party, after the revelation the party agreed to purchase three campaign buses from a company managed by Francis months before the appointment.",

        "content": "Judge in Roundup maker\u2019s first federal trial had banned discussion of the company\u2019s alleged manipulation of science\nMonsanto is facing its first federal trial over allegations that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, but a US judge has blocked attorneys from discussing the corporation\u2019s alleged manipulation of science.\nIn an extraordinary move in a packed San Francisco courtroom on Monday, US judge Vince Chhabria threatened to sanction and \u201cshut down\u201d a cancer patient\u2019s attorney for violating his ban on talking about Monsanto\u2019s influence on government regulators and cancer research. \u201cYou\u2019ve completely disregarded the limitations that were set upon you,\u201d the visibly angry judge said to attorney Aimee Wagstaff, threatening to prevent her from continuing. \u201cIf you cross the line one more time \u2026 your opening statement will be over \u2026 If I see a single inappropriate thing on those slides, I\u2019m shutting you down.\u201d\nThe unusual conflict in the federal courtroom has fueled concerns among Monsanto\u2019s critics that the trial may be unfairly stacked against the plaintiff, Edwin Hardeman, a 70-year-old Santa Rosa man who alleges that his exposure to Roundup over several decades caused his cancer. Building on longstanding allegations, Hardeman\u2019s lawyers and other critics have argued that Monsanto has for years suppressed negative studies and worked to promote and \u201cghostwrite\u201d favorable studies about its herbicide to influence the public and regulators.\nIn a blow to the plaintiffs, Chhabria this year approved Monsanto\u2019s request to prohibit Hardeman\u2019s attorneys from raising allegations about the corporation\u2019s conduct, saying issues about its influence on science and government were a \u201csignificant \u2026 distraction\u201d. That means jurors must narrowly consider the studies surrounding Roundup\u2019s cancer risks, and if they rule that Monsanto caused Hardeman\u2019s illness, then in a second phase the jury would learn about the company\u2019s conduct when assessing liability and punitive damages.\nHardeman\u2019s trial is considered a \u201cbellwether\u201d case for hundreds of other federal plaintiffs who have made similar claims, meaning its outcome could have an impact on the course of future litigation and potential settlements. The high-stakes case comes amid growing global scrutiny of the health impacts of glyphosate, which is sold under the Roundup brand.\nConcerns about the product escalated last August after a California jury issued an historic verdict, saying Monsanto was liable for a terminally ill man\u2019s cancer and owed him $289m in damages. The groundbreaking ruling against Monsanto set the stage for a new wave of cancer litigation in the US and sparked regulatory debates and campaigns to restrict the chemical across the globe.\nMonsanto is now owned by German pharmaceutical company Bayer, which suffered a 30% share price drop after the verdict and is now facing more than 9,000 similar lawsuits across the country.\nWagstaff told the Guardian last week before trial began that the limitations on evidence in the first phase meant the \u201cjury will only hear half of the story\u201d.\n\u201cThe jury will hear about the science, but they won\u2019t get to hear about how Monsanto influenced it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jury won\u2019t have a complete understanding of the science. If we win without the jury knowing the complete science, that\u2019s a real problem for Monsanto.\u201d\nChhabria repeatedly interrupted Wagstaff\u2019s opening statement Monday morning, reminding jurors that her comments did not constitute evidence and should be taken with a \u201cgrain of salt\u201d. He also asked her to speed up when she was introducing Hardeman and his wife and discussing how they first met in 1975.\nWagstaff spoke in detail about the research on cancer and glyphosate, about some of Monsanto\u2019s involvement in studies, and about the company\u2019s communications with the Environmental Protection Agency. Eventually, the judge ordered the jury to take a break and issued his threat to sanction Wagstaff, though it was unclear which specific statements he had opposed.\nWhen she tried to clarify her remarks, noting that she had clearly made the judge \u201cupset\u201d, Chhabria responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being upset. It\u2019s about running an orderly trial.\u201d\nHe then ordered her to file a written motion by the end of the day arguing why he should not sanction her \u2013 and said he was considering a fine of $1,000.\nThe judge also said he didn\u2019t trust her to continue using her prepared materials: \u201cShould I save Ms Wagstaff from herself by barring her from further use of slides?\u201d He ultimately allowed her to finish her opening statement. He ended the day by again attacking her opening remarks, saying her statements were \u201cincredibly dumb\u201d.\nHardeman, who sat in court with his wife, has alleged that his use of Roundup starting in 1986 to control poison oak and weeds on his property caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a cancer that affects the immune system.\nHardeman\u2019s case builds on a key 2015 ruling by the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d, based on a review of existing research. Monsanto continues to argue that Roundup is safe, citing other studies. The company has also suggested Hardeman\u2019s hepatitis C could be a possible cause of his cancer.\nBrian Stekloff, Monsanto\u2019s attorney, described NHL as a \u201ccommon cancer\u201d in his opening remarks, saying the cause is \u201cunknown\u201d for the vast majority of cases, adding: \u201cRoundup did not cause Mr Hardeman\u2019s non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u201d\nHe noted that doctors have not specifically noted Hardeman\u2019s use of Roundup in his medical records.\nA Bayer spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the \u201cextensive body of scientific research ... supports the conclusion that Roundup is not responsible for his illness\u201d and noted the EPA\u2019s 2017 assessment, finding that glyphosate was \u201cnot likely to be carcinogenic to humans\u201d. The EPA previously faced backlash when emails revealed the agency\u2019s close communications with Monsanto.\nHardeman, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of NHL in 2015, has remained dedicated to the lawsuit, even if though it has taken a \u201ctoll on him emotionally and physically\u201d, Wagstaff said in interview before trial: \u201cIt\u2019s really important for him now to do this. He\u2019s a man with high integrity \u2026 When you see some of the ways Monsanto has manipulated the science and robbed him of his choices, it\u2019s pretty egregious.\u201d\nDewayne Johnson, a former school groundskeeper, won the landmark victory last year when the jurors ruled that Monsanto failed to warn him of the health hazards from exposure to Roundup, had \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d, and was responsible for \u201cnegligent failure\u201d. A judge later reduced the damages to $78m, but rejected Monsanto\u2019s appeal to overturn the verdict.\nJohnson\u2019s case presented internal documents that his lawyers said revealed the ways Monsanto had \u201cbullied\u201d scientists with critical findings.\nThe restrictions on testimony about Monsanto\u2019s conduct and alleged manipulation of science is likely to be a major detriment to Hardeman and future plaintiffs, said Jean M Eggen, professor emerita at Widener University Delaware Law School.\n\u201cIt was a brilliant move on the part of the defendant Bayer to try to keep [out] all of that information,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it may pay off for them.\u201d",

The Italian has found himself under mounting pressure of late with open revolt erupting in the stands over his tactics during the recent FA Cup elimination by Manchester United, and Arrizabalaga\u2019s actions had fuelled the suspicion that a mutinous mood was now spreading on to the pitch.\nThe goalkeeper had twice required treatment during extra time, apparently suffering from cramp \u2013 he subsequently suggested he had been buying time for his teammates to recover after a gruelling goalless final \u2013 before angrily waving away frantic attempts by Sarri and his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, to replace him with Willy Caballero in the last minute of extra time.\nHis refusal to leave the field prompted a furious reaction from Sarri who, after the final whistle, attempted to confront the 24-year-old and had to be held back by Antonio R\u00fcdiger as the players gathered to compose themselves for the shootout.\nThat was duly lost 4-3, with Arrizabalaga saving from Leroy San\u00e9 but allowing Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s penalty to slip under his body and in.\nThe pair spoke post-match, insisting the incident had stemmed from a breakdown in communication with the \u00a371.3m world-record signing insisting it had \u201cnever been my intention to go against the manager\u201d. He subsequently went further on social media: \u201cI have full respect for the coach and his authority.\u201d\nWhile no senior players had attempted to usher him off with the fourth official holding up his number and his prospective replacement waiting awkwardly on the touchline, his refusal to leave the pitch is understood to have left teammates distinctly unimpressed.\nSarri and Arrizabalaga had attempted to clear the air in the dressing room after media duties had been completed, with the issue addressed again at a team meeting at Cobham before the squad\u2019s warm-down session on Monday.\nRegardless, the head coach and player still felt compelled to release statements through the club late on Monday night to resolve the issue well in advance of Wednesday\u2019s Premier League game at home against Tottenham.\n\u201cI was very happy to play in my first cup final for Chelsea and very proud of the team performance,\u201d said Arrizabalaga. \u201cI have thought a lot more about yesterday\u2019s events. Although there was a misunderstanding, on reflection, I made a big mistake with how I handled the situation.\n\u201cI wanted to take the time today to apologise fully and in person to the coach, to Willy, my teammates and to the club. I have done this and now I want to offer the same apology to the fans. I will learn from this episode and will accept any punishment or discipline the club decides is appropriate.\u201d\nThat amounts to a fine of one week\u2019s wages, which has been donated to the Chelsea Foundation, with the club dropping their customary policy of keeping any internal sanctions private.\nSarri had initially criticised the player\u2019s conduct while toeing the party line over the misunderstanding, but has now received a personal apology.\n\u201cKepa and I have spoken about the incident,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good conversation. There was a misunderstanding yesterday but he realises he made a big mistake in the way he reacted. He has apologised to me, his team-mates and the club.\n\u201cIt is up to the club if they want to discipline him according to the club rules, but for me this matter is now closed.\n\u201cThe team performance as a whole was extremely positive and it is a shame to see how this incident has overshadowed our efforts in what was a very competitive cup final. Everyone\u2019s focus is now on the next game and we must all now put this behind us.\u201d\nThe Italian\u2019s position at Stamford Bridge remains under serious risk, even after his team\u2019s more encouraging showing at Wembley against a City side who had thrashed them 6-0 two weeks previously. Yet the goalless draw was achieved playing far more pragmatic, counterattacking football more akin to the approach of previous Chelsea managers than Sarri\u2019s preferred style.\nDefeat against Spurs could leave his team six points adrift of the top four, putting his job prospects in doubt with the England assistant manager and former Chelsea coach, Steve Holland, the favourite to take over on an interim basis until the summer if Sarri is dismissed seven months into a three-year contract.\nDavid Luiz had led the public show of support in their beleaguered head coach in the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s loss, insisting he retains the support and respect of the group. \u201cThe coach has the power over the group and he has our respect,\u201d said the Brazil centre-half. \u201cFor me, there is not a problem here with that. We all believe in his philosophy. We all believe in the way he wants us to play.\u201d",

First Newspoll refused to budge, now this week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll has found a similar, though slightly slimmer two-party-preferred figure. But it\u2019s the responses to more detailed questions on the bill that are even more instructive.\nThe breakdown of responses to our Goldilocks propositions \u2013 too hard, too soft or about right \u2013 suggests the split that is occurring is at the Liberal base. The vast majority of Labor voters believe the legislation strikes the right balance or does not go far enough. In contrast, more than a third of Liberal voters see the legislation as reasonable and a further 5% want something even more humane.\nGiven this legislation was conceived by a group of independents who are holding traditionally heartland Liberal seats and espousing traditionally \u201csmall l\u201d liberal values, this should hardly surprise.\nWhile it is true the feelings are yet to be tested in the shrill and highly resourced roar of a federal campaign, these numbers suggest that far from destroying Labor, an all-out campaign on boats has the real prospect of further cannibalising the government\u2019s base.\nOn these figures, expect the PM to do what he does best and saunter on to his next scare: likely to be a vociferous attempt to conflate the series of measures Labor has taken to close tax loopholes with another old standard: Labor is for higher taxes.\nMorrison will confect a budget surplus, splash tax cuts around and then attempt to make the election about tax. His only problem is \u2013 according to another table in this week\u2019s report \u2013 it will again be his base that splits.\nWhen we presented respondents with clear choices between stated ALP policy and some of the so-called \u201ctax cuts\u201d they are being accused of pursuing, there was a clear preference for closing the loopholes with everyone \u2013 except Coalition voters who are split right down the middle.\nThese figures suggest to me that politics of boats and tax has moved on from the Howard years. The mainstream is more progressive, and one-time Liberal voters are finding their values aligned with what they used to regard as the other side of politics.\nSo while the wedge is undoubtedly on, it\u2019s of a new garden variety \u2013 the self-administered atomic wedgie, where the flanks of the victim are painfully separated as the wearer blindly lurches around with his own elastic waistband obscuring his vision.\n Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist",

He has since quit the party and is running as an independent.\nMLCs Cate Faerhmann and Justin Field, factional allies of Buckingham, warned an \u201cirrevocable split\u201d was imminent in December unless there was a recount of the ballots for the upper-house preselection. Another ally, MLC Dawn Walker, also requested a formal recount, arguing in December that people who had voted for Buckingham risked being \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d.\nThe preselection was decided by a members\u2019 vote earlier last year, in which the incumbent MLC David Shoebridge, from the party\u2019s left, received the most first preference votes (1,161), followed by Buckingham (780).\nDue to the party\u2019s affirmative action rules, two men cannot occupy the first and second spots, so Abigail Boyd was placed second on the ballot after the distribution of preferences, Buckingham was placed third and Walker fourth. Buckingham was later removed from the ballot.\nWalker and her supporters hope a recount could bump her into the second position in place of Boyd.\n\u201cIf Jeremy was excluded from the count and his 780 first-preference votes were distributed prior to the first count, the order of the ballot may have been different and would have directly elected a woman into the second position, as per the Greens NSW constitution,\u201d Walker wrote in December.\nEarlier demands for a recount have failed \u2013 the deadline for parties to lodge their tickets is 6 March.\nHarris told Guardian Australia he and Johnston believed moving candidates up the order of the ballot, rather than carrying out a recount, ran contrary to the Greens\u2019 principle of grassroots democracy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking this action because 780 members voted in the preselection, that\u2019s 30% of the voters, and their votes have been put aside by using this practice, which some inside the Greens say is the usual practice. We disagree with that.\u201d\nThe matter was due to be addressed at a meeting of the state delegates council at the weekend, but a spokesman for the NSW party said a proposal for the recount was withdrawn.\n\u201cThe upper-house candidates remain David Shoebridge, Abigail Boyd and Dawn Walker \u2013 in that order,\u201d he said.\nThe allegations against Buckingham, which were detailed in an investigation on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program in August and were also the subject of a speech under parliamentary privilege by the Greens MP Jenny Leong, were investigated by an external company, Workdynamic.\nThe full report has never been made public but the party confirmed the investigation found Workdynamic was \u201cnot satisfied that there is sufficient evidence on the balance of probabilities that an incident of sexual harassment as defined by the legislation occurred\u201d.",

The world would see that the Vatican was finally getting a grip on the issue that has caused such grave damage to the church for the past 20 years.\nSuch hopes have been dealt a devastating blow by the news that Cardinal George Pell, until recently the third most senior figure at the Vatican, is facing a prison term for the sexual abuse of minors in the 1990s.\nThe Australian\u2019s conviction on criminal charges will have powerful reverberations throughout the global church. It propels the toxic issue of the \u201cabominations\u201d of children \u2013 Francis\u2019s own word \u2013 directly into the heart of the papacy, where until December the disgraced cardinal had a seat as an influential member of C9, the inner circle of pontifical advisers.\nIt is likely to herald further haemorrhaging from the pews of Roman Catholic churches by disillusioned and despairing parishioners in the west. And it sends a potent message to the church\u2019s elite that no one is too important or too powerful to escape justice; some will be quaking in fear under their cassocks as Pell is led away to prison.\nPell\u2019s downfall comes just days after another high-profile figure was defrocked by the pope after a Vatican hearing found him guilty of sexually abusing minors. Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington, was removed from the priesthood after years of swirling rumours about his predatory behaviour with trainee priests. Francis was accused of failing to investigate or take action until a man went public last summer.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nIn France, a verdict is expected next week in the trial of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the archbishop of Lyon, who is accused with five others of helping to cover up alleged sexual abuse. Last month, the Vatican announced that Gustavo Zanchetta, a former Argentinian bishop who was appointed to a senior position at the Holy See in 2017, was under preliminary investigation over alleged sexual abuse claims.\nLast June, Francis accepted the resignation of three Chilean bishops over their handling of abuse cases, including one he had robustly defended a few months earlier. In July, Philip Wilson stepped down as archbishop of Adelaide after he was convicted of concealing child abuse, although he was subsequently acquitted on appeal. In August, a damning grand jury report laid bare the scale of sexual abuse and its cover-up in Pennsylvania.\nAfter a disastrous papal visit to Ireland, a once staunchly Catholic country where the legacy of sexual abuse has decimated some congregations, an investigation in Germany found that more than 1,600 clergy were implicated in the abuse of 3,677 children over a 60-year period; it was \u201cprobably only the tip of the iceberg\u201d. More than half the senior clerics in the Netherlands were accused of covering up sexual abuse, and thus allowing the perpetrators to commit more crimes, between 1945 and 2010.\nIn the UK, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse heard graphic testimony from former pupils at Catholic schools. In December, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior cleric in England and Wales, denied under cross-examination that he had covered up abuse; this month, it emerged that the pope\u2019s representative in Britain had failed to respond the inquiry\u2019s demands for information.\nObservers point out that the scandals uncovered so far focus on the sexual abuse of minors in western countries. There has been little detail heard thus far on the \u201csexual slavery\u201d \u2013 again, the pope\u2019s words \u2013 and abuse suffered by nuns and sisters in religious orders; and few accounts of abuse and exploitation by clerics in the global south, where the Catholic church has enjoyed exponential growth. That is all to come, they say.\nIt is hard to see how Pope Francis can avoid the blowback from such a global disaster, and particularly from Pell\u2019s downfall, despite his repeated talk of shame, remorse, zero tolerance and \u201cnever again\u201d. He has identified \u201cclerical culture\u201d, or excessive deference to the clergy, as a major problem. Changing a culture so dominant at all levels of the church is essential but extremely difficult. And, as ever, Francis will face powerful resistance from those with most to lose.",

Pressed on who would be picking up the tab, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the required transmission infrastructure needed to \u201cstand on [its] own two feet as viable investments\u201d and he noted there was already a need to boost the infrastructure supporting the Snowy scheme.\nMorrison on Tuesday confirmed the commonwealth would kick in $1.38bn in equity to the project championed by Malcolm Turnbull during his prime ministership, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said he was confident the total cost of the project would be in the range of $3.8 to $4.5bn.\nThe cost estimates in the business case for the Snowy 2.0 expansion have not been released publicly. Given the development is in the Kosciuszko national park, the project will also require environmental approvals, certainly at the state level, and likely at the commonwealth level.\nPaul Broad, the chief executive of Snowy Hydro, told reporters the plan was for the project to be operational from late 2024.\nBut the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the government should release the full business case so the opposition and other stakeholders could ensure the project stacked up.\nHe noted the government had already spent $6bn on the project, buying stakes previously controlled by NSW and Victoria, and now the commonwealth was kicking in another $1.38bn.\n\u201cWe have said, since Malcolm Turnbull made this announcement, that we support these pumped hydro projects in principle, subject only to being able to see the full business case, which still hasn\u2019t been released publicly,\u201d Butler told the ABC. \u201cI mean, today\u2019s announcement takes the spend by this government on Snowy to about $7.5bn, but they still won\u2019t show people the full business case.\u201d\n\u201cWe do want to be able to kick the tyres on this thing\u201d.\nWhile there are concerns in the renewables sector that the Snowy project is expensive and potentially crowds out other developments, Morrison declared the project was essential to ensuring the transition to renewable energy.\n\u201cIf you want to transition over time to a renewable future for energy, then you cannot do it without stations like this and stations like in Tasmania, because as we all know, the wind does know blow all the time and the sun does not always shine, and it\u2019s these projects \u2013 the battery we\u2019re talking about here is immense and that firms the renewable power investments that have been made in other types of renewable power, because this will be here to back it up when those power sources fail,\u201d the prime minister said.\nMorrison said the government\u2019s objective was to achieve \u201clower emissions, lower prices, and reliability\u201d \u2013 and that was what voters wanted.\nThe prime minister is using the week to attempt a pivot on climate change in an effort to shore up the government\u2019s \u201csmall-l\u201d liberal constituency ahead of the coming election. Morrison has been lobbied by colleagues to give them a policy to sell on climate change, with voters deeply concerned about the government\u2019s record in the area.\nThe prime minister on Monday committed $2bn to reboot and rebadge Tony Abbott\u2019s emissions reduction fund and he is also working with the Tasmanian government on a new interconnector between the island and the mainland.\nThe Snowy commitment is also part of the current climate offensive, with other hydro projects to follow.\nMorrison also outlined steps that he said would ensure Australia meets its Paris climate target, but in the process of doing that, has revealed the government will factor in 367 megatonnes of abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030).",

They gave Paladin three days to respond, promising \u201cfurther planned actions\u201d if the demands were not met.\n\u201cDuring the transition from Lombrum to Lorengau we were compensated well in terms of our wages/salaries,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever wages were dropped and till now, no increments were implemented to help with the burden of working long hours.\u201d\nIt said workplace health and safety were compromised by employees having to work inside hot containers for hours. \u201cWe\u2019ve had issues of employees feeling faint and sick. There [is] limited supply of water for use.\u201d\nThe petition also complained about the amount of food supplied for workers on 12-hour shifts and frequently referred to the damage done to the image of Manus Island and its population.\n\u201cWe also do believe that [the] once peaceful Manus Island and its people has been a centre of attention for media propaganda, political gimmick and negative image portrayal in the face of domestic, national and international community at large, whilst playing host to the asylum seekers since 2012,\u201d it said.\n\u201cWe therefore believe that a good deed in the form of compensation to the Paladin waged employees will gain and restore some lost pride and also portray a positive image of Paladin.\u201d\nEarly reporting at the time of Paladin\u2019s engagement suggested Fijian workers Paladin had intended to hire as guards would be paid about F$4,480 per month (A$3,000).\nThat attempt to bring in foreign workers sparked tension on Manus Island and a standoff with another security provider who felt his company, Kingfisher, should have been given the contract.\nPaladin declined to comment on the petition or answer specific questions around the pay and conditions of its workforce. It directed Guardian Australia to its previous statement, which said the company engaged with communities \u201cwherever\u201d it works.\n\u201cWe understand our guard force in Manus under Pomwan Paladin Security Limited to be among the highest trained and highest paid in Papua New Guinea (Security Industry Authority 2018),\u201d it said.\n\u201cOur partnership success story under the Pomwan Paladin Joint Venture with Manusian businessman Rodney Pokapin should be celebrated and encouraged. We are proud of what can be achieved when working with local communities and we employ over 97% PNG nationals across our workforces.\u201d\nThe protesters said in a statement: \u201cWe have many requests to improve our working conditions. Many of these are quite simply promises made by Paladin that have not been kept.\n\u201cWe are the rightful citizens of this nation island being affected. We are truly being underpaid and being overworked and not compensated fairly.\u201d",

It will run in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane through August.\nJackman\u2019s biggest Hollywood roles include playing Wolverine in the X-Men franchise, as well as his Oscar-nominated performance as Jean Valjean in the 2012 film version of Les Miserables. The Greatest Showman, which starred Jackman as PT Barnum, was a box office sensation despite being critically panned.\nThe Grammy-winning soundtrack went on to become the highest selling album of 2018, and the film\u2019s director, Michael Gracey, told the Sun last week that they were working on a follow-up film. \u201cWhen a movie becomes as big a success as this, it\u2019s only natural there is demand for a sequel,\u201d Gracey said. \u201cSo those discussions have started and we are working on one right now.\u201d\nJackman announced the Australian dates at a press conference in Sydney on Tuesday, where he performed A Million Dreams, a song from the Greatest Showman, with 50 singers from the Australian Girls Choir. Settle sang the Golden Globe-winning song This Is Me, before Jackman, Settle and host Andy Lee surprised the gathered journalists by performing an \u201celegant, swellegant\u201d (and fairly hammy) all-singing Q&A.\nSettle will be joining Jackman for each show on the Australian tour. Jackman told the audience about the day she was cast in The Greatest Showman.

The offences occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne.\nHe is due to be sentenced next week but may be taken into custody at a plea hearing on Wednesday, having been out on bail since the verdict and recovering from knee surgery.\nPope Francis, who has previously praised Pell for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, has yet to publicly react, but just two days after the unreported verdict in December the Vatican announced that Pell and two other cardinals had been removed from the pontiff\u2019s council of advisers.\nPell\u2019s conviction and likely imprisonment will cause shockwaves through a global Catholic congregation and is a blow to Francis\u2019s efforts to get a grip on sexual abuse.\nIt comes just days after an unprecedented summit of cardinals and senior bishops in the presence of the pope at the Vatican, intended to signal a turning point on the issue that has gravely damaged the church and imperilled Francis\u2019s papacy.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nThe suppression order covering the case was lifted by county court chief judge Peter Kidd on Tuesday morning.\nPell walked from the Melbourne courtroom to a waiting car surrounded by a phalanx of police and press. He was jeered by survivors of sexual abuse who had gathered outside.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to burn in hell. Burn in hell, Pell,\u201d one man yelled.\nPell did not comment but a statement released by his solicitor Paul Galbally said the cardinal \u201chas always maintained his innocence and continues to do so.\u201d\n\u201cAn appeal has been lodged against his conviction and he will await the outcome of the appeal process.\u201d\nOne of the complainants at the centre of the case, who cannot be named, asked for privacy in the wake of the suppression order being lifted, saying he was \u201ca regular guy working to support and protect my family as best I can.\u201d\n\u201cLike many survivors I have experienced shame, loneliness, depression and struggle,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cLike many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life.\n\u201cAt some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust. I would like to thank my family near and far for their support of me, and of each other.\u201d\nBefore returning to Australia to face the charges, Pell was for three years prefect of the secretariat for the economy of the Holy See, making him one of the most senior Catholics in the world. He was one of Francis\u2019s most trusted advisers, and was handpicked to oversee the Vatican\u2019s complex finances and root out corruption.On the day of the dramatic verdict, after a four-and-a-half-week trial, Pell stood in the dock showing no reaction and staring straight ahead. The room was silent as the foreman told the court that the jury had found the cardinal guilty on all charges. Pell\u2019s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, when asked by journalists if he would appeal, responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nPell will now almost certainly face jail time.\nThe jury found that in the second half of December 1996, while he was archbishop of Melbourne, Pell walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and sexually assaulted them.\nThe complainant, who is now aged 35, said he and the other choirboy had separated from the choir procession as it exited the church building. The prosecution\u2019s case hinged on his evidence, as the other victim died in 2014 after a heroin overdose. Neither victim told anyone about the offending at the time.\nAfter leaving the procession, the complainant said, he and the other boy sneaked back into the church corridors and entered the priest\u2019s sacristy, a place they knew they should not be. There they found some sacramental wine and began to drink. The complainant alleged that Pell had walked in on them and told them something to the effect that they were in trouble.\nPell manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. He stepped forward, grabbed the other boy by the back of his head, and forced the boy\u2019s head on to his penis, the complainant told the court.\nPell then did the same thing to the complainant, orally raping him. Once he had finished, he ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself. The complainant said the attack lasted only a few minutes, and the boys left the room afterwards, hung up their choir robes and went home.\nBeing in the choir was a condition of the complainant\u2019s scholarship to attend St Kevin\u2019s College, an elite independent school in the affluent inner-Melbourne suburb of Toorak, the court heard.\n\u201cI knew a scholarship could be given or taken away even at that age,\u201d the complainant told the court. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose that. It meant so much to me. And what would I do if I said such a thing about an archbishop? It\u2019s something I carried with me the whole of my life.\u201d\nThe complainant alleged that either later that year in 1996, or in early 1997, Pell attacked him again. He said he was walking down a hallway to the choristers\u2019 change room, again after singing at Sunday solemn mass at the cathedral, when Pell allegedly pushed him against the wall and squeezed his genitals hard through his choir robes, before walking off.\nThe complainant told the court that after the attacks he could not fathom what had happened to him and that he dealt with it by pushing it to the \u201cdarkest corners and recesses\u201d of his mind.\nIn his police statement, the complainant said he remembered Pell \u201cbeing a big force in the place\u201d.\n\u201cHe emanated an air of being a powerful person,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with this a long time \u2026 and my ability to be here. [Because] I think Pell has terrified me my whole life \u2026 he was [later] in the Vatican. He was an extremely, presidentially powerful guy who had a lot of connections.\u201d\nIn his closing address, the crown prosecutor Mark Gibson told the jury their verdict would come down to whether they believed the complainant beyond reasonable doubt. They should find the complainant an honest witness, Gibson said.\nPell pleaded not guilty from the beginning. He was interviewed by a Victorian detective, Christopher Reed, in Rome in October 2016, and the video of that interview was played to the court. In that interview Pell described the allegations as \u201ca load of garbage and falsehood\u201d.\nWhen Reed said the attacks were alleged to have occurred after Sunday mass, Pell responded: \u201cThat\u2019s good for me as it makes it even more fantastically impossible.\u201d Pell\u2019s defence team told the jury there were so many improbabilities in the prosecution\u2019s case that they should conclude the abuse could not have happened. Richter said it was unlikely that two boys could leave the choir procession after mass unnoticed or that the sacristy would be unattended or left unlocked, or that Pell would be able to manoeuvre his robes to show his penis in the way described by the complainant. The robes were brought into the court for jurors to view.\nRichter used a PowerPoint presentation in the retrial during his closing address to the jurors, something he did not do in the first. One of the slides read: \u201cOnly a madman would attempt to rape two boys in the priests\u2019 sacristy immediately after Sunday solemn mass.\u201d\nIn his directions to the jury, Kidd told them that the trial was not an opportunity to make Pell a scapegoat for the failures of the Catholic church.\nThe jury took less than four days to reach their unanimous verdict.\nAs many as 100 journalists accused of breaching the suppression order have been threatened with a charge of contempt of court and could face possible jail terms. Letters were sent to journalists from major media outlets which published or broadcast pieces in relation to the trial including News Corp, Nine Entertainment and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in February.\nThe reason for the strict order was that Pell faced a second trial in relation to separate alleged historical offences. The first trial was suppressed temporarily so information from it would be less likely to influence the jury in the second. Suppression orders are not unusual in such cases.\nBut Kidd has now ordered that reporting restrictions be lifted after the Department of Public Prosecutions dropped the second set of charges. Kidd had ruled that key evidence was inadmissible and could not be used, significantly weakening the prosecution\u2019s case.\nPresident of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Mark Coleridge, said the case had shocked many across Australia and around the world, \u201cincluding the Catholic Bishops of Australia.\u201d\n\u201cThe bishops agree that everyone should be equal under the law, and we respect the Australian legal system. The same legal system that delivered the verdict will consider the appeal that the Cardinal\u2019s legal team has lodged.\u201d\n\u201cOur hope, at all times, is that through this process, justice will be served.\u201d",

Vietnamese officials were on hand to receive him at the station with a red carpet and guard of honour, with North Korean and Vietnamese flags flying.\nKim was seen leaving the train in Dong Dang and getting into a Mercedes Benz for the 170km (105-mile) journey to the capital, Hanoi. He waved to young people lining the street as the car set off, flanked by about a dozen bodyguards running alongside.\nThere is no real expectation the second meeting will bring a final deal on ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons that threaten the US, but there are some hopes it could lead to a declaration that the 1950-53 Korean War is at last formally over.\nThe world leaders will be joined US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who also arrived on Tuesday morning. Trump and Kim will then hold a series of official meetings on Thursday.\nTrump, who lands in Vietnam late on Tuesday, will have meetings with the host country\u2019s president and prime minister on Wednesday before seeing Kim. Before leaving Washington on Monday, Trump tweeted that he was \u201cLooking forward to a very productive summit.\u201d\nHe earlier told US governors that \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a very tremendous summit.\u201d\nHis upbeat assessment contrasts with earlier comments that the US will be \u201chappy\u201d if North Korea simply agrees to continue its moratorium on nuclear and missile testing. The US president\u2019s remarks on Sunday night represented a lowering of already modest expectations for the second meeting.\nTrump once warned that North Korea\u2019s arsenal posed such a threat to humanity that he may have no choice but to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the rogue nation, yet last week he declared that he was in \u201cno rush\u201d for Pyongyang to prove it was abandoning its weapons.\nTrump appears to be holding out economic progress for North Korea as a potential reward, saying it will become an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d in the event of complete denuclearisation.\nTrump and Kim first met last June in Singapore, a summit that yielded powerful images but few concrete steps for North Korea\u2019s denuclearisation.\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this article",

        "content": "Prosecutors send letters to publishers, editors and reporters at News Corp, the ABC and others\n Follow live updates on the reaction to Cardinal George Pell\u2019s conviction \n Full report: Pell found guilty of child sexual assault\n Five times guilty: how Pell\u2019s past caught up with him\nAs many as 100 journalists have been threatened with a charge of contempt of court \u2013 and could face possible jail terms \u2013 over reporting of the Cardinal George Pell trial.\nVictoria\u2019s director of public prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC, has written to as many as 100 individual publishers, editors, broadcasters, reporters and subeditors at the media giants News Corp Australia, Nine Entertainment, the ABC, Crikey and several smaller publications, accusing them of breaching a nationwide suppression order imposed during the case. Nine\u2019s Melbourne masthead The Age alone received more than 30 letters.\nLetters were sent to the journalists in early February saying that they had potentially interfered with the administration of justice and scandalised the court.\nThe ones who do not have a strong enough explanation could be prosecuted.\nThe suppression order was issued by the chief judge of Melbourne\u2019s county court, Peter Kidd, on 25 June 2018 in the matter of DPP v George Pell. The prosecution had applied for the suppression order to prevent \u201ca real and substantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice\u201d because Pell originally was to face a second trial on separate charges.\nBut when the guilty verdict came down in December, some international media outlets \u2013 who were unlikely to have been in court \u2013 published or broadcast the news. These international outlets included the Daily Beast, the Washington Post and several Catholic websites.\n\u201cCardinal George Pell has been found guilty in Australia of charges related to sexual abuse, according to two people familiar with the case and other media reports, becoming the highest-ranking Vatican official to face such a conviction,\u201d the Washington Post reported on 12 December. Many of the articles were later removed.\nSome local media followed suit, publishing articles which Kidd said raised a question of whether they were aimed at putting \u201cinappropriate pressure on him\u201d \u2013 even though these were vague and did not mention Pell\u2019s name or the verdict.\nThe outlets which published or broadcast pieces in relation to the trial included the Herald Sun, the Age, Macquarie Media, Nine News in Melbourne, an ABC radio program outside Melbourne and News Corp\u2019s the Australian. Private Media\u2019s Crikey website published a wrap of how the newspapers covered the Pell verdict, with snapshots of the front pages. The small website alone received five letters from the DPP.\nThe Herald Sun published the most dramatic piece: a black front page with the word CENSORED in large white letters. \u201cThe world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,\u201d the page one editorial said. \u201cThe Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this very significant news. But trust us, it\u2019s a story you deserve to read.\u201d\nA group of eight court reporters who attended both Pell trials every day, who included journalists from Guardian Australia and ABC News, did not breach the suppression order.\nJudd asked some recipients of the letter to reply by 15 February as to why they should not be charged with contempt of court. All the publications which referenced the Pell case, even obliquely, were targeted because there was a blanket suppression on any information about the case.\nSome of the alleged breaches were considered to be more flagrant than others. As many as 30 people at the Herald Sun and the Age received letters \u2013 even those who were not involved or who were not working on the day.\nWhen the judge was made aware of the breaches he told a closed court they were of a serious nature and certain editors faced imprisonment.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nThe local online articles were removed when editors read Kidd\u2019s angry comments in a transcript sent to media outlets. Nine\u2019s The Australian Financial Review, which published Kidd\u2019s angry comments, also received two letters from the DPP.\nKidd told the court the publications had potentially breached the law, brought improper pressure upon the court and had committed a \u201cpotentially egregious and flagrant\u201d contempt of court.\n\u201cA number of very important people in the media are facing, if found guilty, the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment, and it may well be that many significant members of the media community are in that potential position,\u201d Kidd said on 13 December.\nRival news organisations have been working together to respond to the charges. Lawyers for Nine\u2019s the Age and News Corp\u2019s the Herald Sun have prepared a joint response to the DPP, a source said.\nAddressing Pell\u2019s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, Kidd said the media were \u201coperating on a misinformed basis that it\u2019s OK to print everything and anything apart from the name of your client\u201d.\nDiscussing the Herald Sun report, Richter said although Pell\u2019s name was not mentioned, the reference to \u201ca very prominent Australian figure\u201d meant the \u201cconnection cannot fail to be made\u201d.\n\u201cI am told it was on Wikipedia last night \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen that but it was apparently removed this morning \u2013 and so it really is a matter for showing cause if there is one,\u201d Richter said.\nKidd said he believed some of the articles were designed to put pressure on the court, a tactic he labelled \u201cbreathtaking\u201d.\nThe Age reported after the suppression order was lifted on Tuesday that its lawyer Justin Quill was representing 53 media clients including those at The Age.\nQuill wrote to the DPP saying that the \u2018\u2018virtually identical\u2019\u2019 letters had distressed the staff, represented a scattergun approach and were \u2018\u2018inappropriate and disturbing\u2019\u2019.\n\u2018\u2018It is difficult to understand your letters as anything other than a concerted and strategic attack on the media, rather than an upholding of the law,\u201d Quill wrote.\nA spokeswoman for Nine Entertainment said Quill was representing all the Nine outlets, News Corp and smaller websites like Mamamia. \u201cLike a large number of media outlets, we received these letters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe deny all the allegations made by the DPP.\u201d\nThe Melbourne broadcaster Jon Faine, who has not been sent a letter, mentioned the suppression order on his ABC program this month without referring to the specifics of the case.\nFaine said when suppression orders were \u201cproperly used\u201d any breaches must be prosecuted.\n\u201cThis week, a large number \u2013 I am told 70 \u2013 media outlets and journalists across Australia and some overseas \u2013 including sadly one ABC program \u2013 have been asked to show cause why they ought not be proceeded against for a clear breach of a suppression order from one of our courts.\n\u201cEditors and publishers as well as journalists could well go to jail. This mass prosecution could lead to a test of the powers of the courts in the digital age, to control the flow of information that can interfere with the administration of justice.\n \u201cJudge-alone trials \u2013 instead of juries \u2013 in publicity sensitive matters are part of the answer and must be adopted urgently.\u201d\n On 28 February 2019 this article was amended to remove CNN as one of the news organisations that published the Pell verdict in December.",

        "content": "In 1973, hundreds of citizens were deported from their home. One woman tells her story\nOn Monday, the UK\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the remote Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean was ruled illegal by the UN\u2019s highest court, which told Britain to hand them back as soon as possible. Although the majority decision by the international court of justice in The Hague is only advisory, it represents a significant defeat for the UK.\nDecades of forced exile have dispersed Chagossian communities around the world. Most live in the UK, Mauritius or the Seychelles. None have been allowed to return. Monday\u2019s judgment by the ICJ has raised their hopes that they may eventually be able to reclaim their homes.\nMarie Liseby Elys\u00e9 was born on the island of Peros Banhos in 1953 but forcibly evicted by colonial administrators in 1973. She travelled to The Hague last September to give evidence about her experiences. Here, she tells her story:\n\u201cIn Chagos everyone had a job, his family and his culture. All that we ate was fresh food. Ships which came from Mauritius brought all our goods.\nBut one day the administrator told us that we had to leave our island, leave our houses and go away. All persons were unhappy. But we had no choice. They did not give us any reason.\nShips which used to bring food stopped coming. We had nothing to eat. No medicine. Nothing at all. We suffered a lot. But then one day, a ship called Nordvaer came.\n\nDiego Garcia is made home to a French colony using slave labour on plantations\nMauritius and the Chagos Islands are ceded to Britain\u00a0at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in the Treaty of Paris\nBefore independence is granted to Mauritius, the UK separates the Chagos archipelago from Mauritius, creating British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).\nBritain allows the US to use the largest island, Diego Garcia, as a military base in exchange for a discount on the purchase of Polaris missiles.\nForced expulsion of around 1,500 Chagossians begin as access to food supplies is restricted. Most are moved to Mauritius or the Seychelles.\nChagossian refugees in Mauritius were paid compensation, and more offers followed contingent on them signing agreements not to return to their homes.\nBritish passports are granted to some Chagossians. Many move from Mauritius to Crawley.\u00a0A UK government feasibility study into resettlement concludes it would be expensive and difficult.\u00a0\nA Marine Protected Area is established around the Chagos Islands. Documents published by Wikileaks show a UK diplomat saying that \u201cestablishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago\u2019s former residents\u201d.\nInternational Court of Justice rules that the agreement to separate the Chagos Islands from Mauritius in 1965 prior to decolonisation was unlawful.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe United Nations general assembly overwhelmingly backs a motion condemning Britain\u2019s occupation of the islands. The vote, which left the UK diplomatically isolated, set a six-month deadline for the UK to withdraw from the archipelago and for it to be reunified with neighbouring Mauritius.\nThe administrator told us we had to board the ship, leaving everything, leaving all our personal belongings behind except a few clothes and go. When we boarded the ship, conditions in the hull of the ship were bad. We were like animals and slaves in that ship.\nPeople were dying of sadness in that ship. And as for me I was four months pregnant at that time. The ship took four days to reach Mauritius. After our arrival, my child was born and died.\nNobody would like to be uprooted from the island where he was born, to be uprooted like animals. And it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\nThe consequences of the UK\u2019s mass deportation of Chagossians have reverberated down the generations, disrupting the lives of their descendants. Taniella Moustache, 18, who lives in Milton Keynes, was among the third-generation Chagossians who were facing deportation from the UK last year.\nHer grandmother was among those forcibly evicted by the British government from the Chagos Islands in 1971 and resettled in the Seychelles.\n  Her mother, Jeanette Valentin, who was born in the Seychelles, subsequently came to Britain but was told that her daughters do not automatically qualify for UK citizenship. The Home Office maintains that citizenship is normally only passed on to one generation born abroad.Valentin told the Guardian last year: \u201c[The UK government] removed my family and put a military base there but now don\u2019t want my kids to be British citizens. The Home Office said they cannot give my children British passports because they were not born in England.\n  \u201cThey say I have to apply for citizenship but I cannot afford it. It is a lot of money, around \u00a31,600 per child. I get paid only \u00a3600 to last every two weeks and my rent is \u00a3600 \u2026 sometimes I don\u2019t have enough money to eat. The children of those who relocated should automatically be given citizenship.\u201d",

We have to practice preventative diplomacy rather than reactive diplomacy.\u201d\nHe called on Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the inquiry set up by the UN to look into the death of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\nQatar has been on the receiving end of an economic, diplomatic and political boycott by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, stretching back to June 2017. Those countries accuse Qatar of funding extremist groups and being too close to Iran \u2013 allegations Qatar denies. The Qatari government consider itself a benefactor and mediator, offering its territory as the UN\u2019s sub-station in the middle east. The country, which has a $300bn (\u00a3230bn) sovereign wealth fund and large gas reserves, hopes hosting the football world cup in 2022 will boost its prestige on the international stage.\nAs well as acting as a mediator with the Taliban, Qatar has, according to Thani, provided more than $1bn in help to alleviate suffering in Gaza and spent $500m to stabilise the Lebanese economy, a country previously seen as domain of the Saudis. More recently, it has been extending its reach into African and Asian markets.\nUnlike most other Gulf states, Qatar has continued to support the Iran nuclear deal, distancing itself from the anti-Iranian axis of the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel. \u201cOur position on the Iran deal is that, like the Europeans, we support it,\u201d Thani said. \u201cWe do not want a nuclear arms race in our region, and that is the danger.\u201d\nHe insisted this did not mean his country had now, as some claimed, formed a new axis with Iran and Turkey. \u201cOur geography is difficult. We have sided with no one. It\u2019s not easy to be a facilitator for talks between adversaries.\n\u201cIf you look at the core of the issue, the Gulf Cooperation Council [the six-member group of Gulf States] needs to reach an understanding with Iran, not just Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2013 all of us are living in the same neighbourhood and we need to reach an understanding. That was the common position of the GCC countries until 2017, but the boycott changed everything.\u201d\nHe said he had spoken to Jared Kushner, Donald Trump\u2019s middle east advisor, who told him his much-delayed Israel-Palestine peace plan for the region would be \u201cready in a few weeks\u201d. Qatar, Thani insisted, \u201chad no interest in anything that is not a two-state solution, 1967 borders, the right of return, clear designation of Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine\u201d.\nThani reserved some of his harshest judgements for the Khashoggi assassination, which the CIA has concluded was probably ordered by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. \u201cWhat has happened was a brutal crime,\u201d Thani said. \u201cThe family of Khashoggi needs answers and needs to be able to identify what happened to their father. There has to be accountability for what happened. Dealing with political opposition through crimes is wrong.\u201d\nAlthough he said it was not for him to judge the legal process of other countries, he said he hoped Saudi Arabia would cooperate with the UN inquiry into the death. \u201cSince the UN inquiry is an international process under international law, everyone should co-operate,\u201d he said.As to Qatar\u2019s own democratic progress, Thani said his country \u2013 ruled by a monarch \u2013 was slowly evolving, with imminent parliamentary elections. \u201cWe cannot replicate the model of western democracy 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have different customs and models, but we are taking significant steps\u201d.",

Today, the A43 connecting Stamford and Northampton bisects the thick east-west band of woodland; the gap\u2019s significance as a highway in the mid-1100s, and an adjacent stream, would have surely figured in the decision to build a controlling castle here, as the two rivals for the English crown, Matilda and Stephen, fought for control of the country. Within a hundred years the castle had been replaced by an Augustinian priory, but that came to a sticky end in 1536 with Henry VIII\u2019s dissolution of the monasteries.\nAlders sprout from the banks of the small stream. Alnus glutinosa is a wetland specialist, thriving where its roots are saturated, proliferating deep green shiny summer foliage and, in the autumn, bearing little oval cones packed with small floaty seeds. Now though, the alder is perhaps at its finest: the empty cones, still hanging from the branches, are outshone by masses of dangling maroon catkins, gleaming in the low light, waiting pensively to open and release their contents.\nThe hazels in Wakerley Woods are also bedecked with loosely hanging catkins. Corylus avellana is the first of Britain\u2019s native trees to flower and the yellow \u201clamb\u2019s tails\u201d are already shedding pollen.\nSeveral types of trees have catkins; they vary from the fluffy bunny-tail catkins of sallow to the long knotted tassels of the oak. Alders, hazel and birches are closely related and have similar reproductive strategies. These trees are both male and female, the pollen-bearing catkin being the male flower, and the tiny buds topped with a tuft of minute magenta hairs being the female flowers. They are pollinated by the wind, each catkin containing 4m-5m grains of pollen, released on the breezes to find their improbable way to little magenta flowers where an embryonic seed waits to be fertilised.",

        "content": "After a generation in the doghouse, concrete is more fashionable than ever. So why don\u2019t we take better care of our brutalist architecture?\nLove it or loathe it, concrete is everywhere. It is not only under our feet and above our heads, forming the background infrastructure of buildings and cities, but it has infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Bookshelves groan under the weight of hefty volumes celebrating the beauty of concrete, tomes as heavy as the material itself. Homes are adorned with concrete plant pots, concrete worktops and concrete hi-fi speakers, while gift shops brim with tea towels, crockery and cushions celebrating heroic concrete buildings. You can spray yourself with Concrete perfume by Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, wear one of 8,000 concrete jewellery items available on Etsy, drink at the Southbank Centre\u2019s Concrete Cafe, then party at the Concrete Space nightclub.\nHow did this humble mixture of cement and sand, for decades maligned as the scourge of our cities, become the ultimate lifestyle concept, used to sell everything from luxury apartments to club nights?\nThe qualities that attract people to concrete are the very same characteristics that have always repelled others. It is gritty, urban and uncompromising, it stands with a geological heft, forming soaring cliff-faces and plunging gullies, cave-like undercrofts and muscular flyovers. It is the material that most embodies the era of the welfare state, a time when the public sector-built housing, schools, hospitals and theatres on a majestic scale. It is the liquid rock of socialism, the stuff of emphatic nation-building and thrilling sculptural monuments to bygone ambitions. It is also the material most closely associated with the social problems that accompanied the decline in industry, lack of maintenance and inner city decay. It exudes optimism and generosity to some, violence and misery to others.\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nOnly a tiny fraction of the world\u2019s concrete production is used in architecture, and yet it is architects who have done more than anyone else to shape the popular imagination of the material, for better and worse. After a generation in the doghouse, when concrete behemoths regularly topped surveys of buildings most hated by the public, the material has become more fashionable than ever \u2013 at a time when its catastrophic environmental impacts are finally being noticed. A recent report found that cement production accounts for up to 8% of all CO2 emissions worldwide, while concrete waste likely makes up as much as one-fourth of all landfill.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be using concrete at all,\u201d says Barnabas Calder, historian of postwar architecture and author of Raw Concrete, a passionately argued book on the beauty of brutalism. It is an unlikely comment coming from a self-professed addict of the rough stuff, who keeps cherished fragments of demolished car parks as if they were holy relics. \u201cOf course it looks lovely, but it has a massive carbon footprint. We should only keep what we\u2019ve got and not build any more.\u201d\nBooks like Calder\u2019s have done much to popularise the material again, and there are no signs of architects turning their backs on it any time soon. The revival of exposed concrete began in the 1990s, primarily as a reaction against the perceived flimsiness of what architecture had become. Two decades of postmodernism had seen architectural expression reduced to a thin appliqu\u00e9, with buildings dressed up in whatever costume the client so desired. Materials could pretend to be anything they wanted in an era when representation was more important than substance.\nThe ensuing backlash saw an almost religious devotion to the innate properties of raw materials. Architects pursued a kind of spiritual cleansing through a back-to-basics approach that put the utmost emphasis on how materials affected the senses. They wrote dense treatises on phenomenology and the \u201cthingliness of things\u201d, arguing for materials to be exposed and treated with honesty. There was a puritan primitivism to it all, following the excesses of the 80s. Above all else, salvation could be found in the beauty of a board-marked concrete wall, the roughness of the timber shuttering ingrained in the mighty mineral surface.\nAtelier Bardill by Swiss architect Valerio Olgiati Photograph: Declan Fleming/Alamy\nIn this quest for honesty, purity and the special crafting of things, the Swiss have been at the forefront. Coming out of the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich, architects like Peter Zumthor, Valerio Olgiati, Peter M\u00e4rkli and Herzog & de Meuron set a new bar for the sensuous and tactile potentials of concrete. Each battled to be more primal and truthful than the next. Zumthor cast a great concrete tower in a field, using rough aggregate from the landscape, poured over a pyre of tree trunks \u2013 before burning out the wood to create an atmospherically charred chapel within. Olgiati\u2019s sharp white concrete K+N Residence was so seamless that it appeared to have been cast in one pour. His own home in Portugal is a stark hymn to the stuff: concrete walls frame a concrete pool, overlooked by a concrete bunker of a living room, complete with a concrete sofa.\nSuch seductively single-minded projects have been catnip to an architectural profession grown used to specifying products from catalogues of proprietary components. Where once buildings were made, now they are assembled. They are layers of bits, each guaranteed by different warranties, compiled in the most risk-averse manner possible. Exposed concrete, cast in situ, signals a refreshing alternative: the singular material mass is intoxicating.\nOutside Switzerland, Japan and some Latin American countries \u2013 whose challenging topographies have bestowed their respective building cultures with generations of advanced concrete expertise \u2013 it is incredibly difficult to do it well. Good exposed concrete therefore signals a special kind of virtuosity. Architects coo at the seamless soffit and the perfectly board-marked internal corner because they know quite how hard it is to achieve. Zumthor\u2019s latest \u201crammed concrete\u201d house in Devon took 10 years, and several concrete experts, to realise.\nPeter Zumthor\u2019s \u201crammed concrete house\u201d in south Devon, which took 10 years to realise. Photograph: \u00a9 Jack Hobhouse/Living Architecture\nExternally, it is even rarer to find. Increased environmental awareness since the glory days of in situ concrete in the 1960s mean that thermal bridging is now out of the question: a material exposed on the outside of a building cannot continue through to the interior, without a big layer of insulation in between. Concrete structures therefore tend to be insulated and clad with something else, often of a thin, plasticky nature \u2013 including, ironically, a recent vogue for faux-concrete panels, complete with fake shuttering texture.\nThe result is that visible concrete has generally retreated to the realm of interiors, from the sweeping spiral staircase and angled buttresses inside Herzog & de Meuron\u2019s Tate Modern Switch House, to the raw ceilings and walls in AHMM\u2019s White Collar Factory office building. Both projects use naked concrete as a means of simulating an \u201cas found\u201d industrial character. The former riffs off the old oil tanks of the Bankside power station, while the latter creates the illusion of a converted warehouse for tech start-ups at east London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout. Both indulge in fakery, nostalgia and the theatrical power of bare mineral mass.\nThe sweeping spiral staircase and angled buttresses inside Herzog & de Meuron\u2019s Tate Modern Switch House. Photograph: View Pictures/REX/Shutterstock\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a real shift in the last decade,\u201d says Elaine Toogood of The Concrete Centre, part of the industry\u2019s trade association. \u201cThere\u2019s much more acceptance of office buildings having exposed concrete ceilings, which is good for thermal mass and allows you to have higher spaces because it does away with the suspended ceiling. It adds real character too.\u201d\nIt is now common to find it in housing developments as well, where concrete surfaces are left exposed on both environmental grounds (it cools the building in summer and retains warmth in winter), and to give the feeling of a simple, honest shell: you\u2019re not paying for fixtures and fittings that you don\u2019t need. Designs for the affordable Naked House scheme, by young practice OMMX, fetishise its spartan finish, with exposed concrete floors and blockwork walls, implying a level of adaptability and customisation. It is a blank canvas for the residents to make their own mark.\nThe equally spartan exterior and interior of the affordable Naked House, by young practice OMMX\nConcrete may increasingly be seen as a guilty pleasure, but it isn\u2019t going anywhere fast. It allows infinite possibilities for sculptural and tactile effect, capable of being polished or ground, bush-hammered or etched, poured like oil or roughly rammed like compacted muesli. But our chief concern should be looking after what we already have: given the amount of energy embodied in the existing stock of concrete-framed buildings, the priority must be on preserving, retrofitting and reviving what is already there, rather than demolishing and adding to the landfill heap.\n\u201cFor all the enthusiasm, concrete buildings are still being needlessly demolished,\u201d says Calder, \u201cat the same time as being almost excessively voguish on social media. It is a catastrophic waste of resources.\u201d The hashtags and tea towels, it seems, haven\u2019t yet translated into real love and care.\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

        "content": "The show Inside Bitch, made by women with experience of the penal system, dismantles Bad Girls stereotypes, while new play The Jumper Factory explores fear behind men\u2019s bravado\n\u2018Deeply disturbing.\u201d That was how the prisons minister Rory Stewart summed up the state of some British prisons last year. After an Observer investigation revealed that standards in two thirds of institutions were deemed sub-par and two in five unsafe, Stewart acknowledged \u201cincreasing levels of violence committed by prisoners, and horrifying rates of self-harm\u201d. Prison riots, drug use, overcrowding and staff cuts are all widely reported.\nOur understanding of prison life is mostly shaped by such reportage or drama. \u201cPrisons aren\u2019t seen by many people,\u201d says Anna Herrmann, co-artistic director of the Clean Break theatre company. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we break down misconceptions.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s new show, Inside Bitch was conceived by writers Deborah Pearson and Stacey Gregg, and devised by four Clean Break members who are all women with experience of the penal system. It is an attempt to dismantle the pop-culture stereotypes passed down in TV dramas like Bad Girls and Orange is the New Black.\n\u201cThose representations can hinder the experiences of our members,\u201d says co-artistic director R\u00f3is\u00edn McBrinn, citing such programmes\u2019 fixation on relationships and rivalries, corrupt officers and brutality. She does, however, recognise the necessity of a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between drama and reality. \u201cThe truth is staying in your cell for however many hours a day is not great TV.\u201d The point about Inside Bitch is that it wrings entertainment out of lived experience. As McBrinn says, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely theirs.\u201d\nIn a sense, Clean Break has returned to its roots. The company is best known for its recent collaboration with Phyllida Lloyd on the Donmar Warehouse\u2019s all-female Shakespeare trilogy, but its beginnings were forged in self-expression. \u201cIt was very much about women telling their own stories,\u201d Herrmann stresses.\nForty years ago, Jenny Hicks and Jackie Holborough started staging shows when they were serving sentences in Askham Grange open prison in York, expanding its annual Christmas revue into a two-hour show about prison life, Efemera. It was good enough to gain a two-night run at York Arts Centre, making its 21-strong cast the first British prisoners to perform outside prison. On release, Hicks and Holborough launched Clean Break to tour plays written and performed by former female prisoners and within a year, the company was at the Royal Court. In time, they brought in professional playwrights to write scripts from members\u2019 stories and deliver educational workshops in penal institutions.\nClean Break\u2019s workshops are a kind of creative intervention. Working with women who feel shut out by education or society, Herrmann says the aim is to \u201ccreate a space where they\u2019re right, where they\u2019re valued and where their experiences are useful\u201d. She talks of \u201can intensive blossoming, a feeling of being respectful and having something to say\u201d. That\u2019s where empowering its members to create art coincides with issues of representation \u2013 something Inside Bitch hopes to make manifest.\nFor the playwright Luke Barnes, art is \u201cabout starting a conversation in a community and no one\u2019s doing that in prisons\u201d. Last year, the Young Vic took their production of The Brothers Size into Wandsworth prison, following it with a series of participatory workshops led by Barnes and director Justin Audibert. Barnes wanted to make something \u201ctangibly useful\u201d within Wandsworth\u2019s walls \u2013 \u201cnot just to put a play on for the sake of it\u201d. One young inmate suggested the group find a way to admit feeling scared. \u201cHe was like, \u2018We\u2019re all putting on this bravado, but actually it\u2019s a terrifying experience. Life is passing us by outside.\u2019 That was the starting point. The piece became about finding a way for these men to talk about the emotional experience of being inside.\u201d\nPeter Wayne is part of the group that workshopped Barnes\u2019s resulting play, The Jumper Factory. Now 64, Wayne has spent a total of 32 years in prison on multiple convictions. He has always taken part in prison activities, working on projects with the National Theatre and English National Opera. \u201cAnything\u2019s better than being in your cell,\u201d he says. \u201cThe theatre creates this world you can escape into within the penal microcosm. They bring humanity into prisons. They allow you to be something other than a prisoner \u2013 not just a character, but a human being, an artist.\u201d\nGiven the constraints of the process \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t be sure people will turn up tomorrow\u201d \u2013 Barnes compiled a choral text based on conversations with participants about the ways masculinity manifests in prison settings. The Jumper Factory was initially performed within Wandsworth prison itself, before the text was passed to teenagers at risk of offending for public performance at the Festival of European Youth Theatre in Birmingham, and now at the Young Vic ahead of a tour.\nClean Break\u2019s co-directors welcome the interest from mainstream organisations, but they\u2019re wary of dilettantism too. McBrinn \u201chopes it\u2019s not a flash in the pan\u201d. Herrmann is more cautious: \u201cWhat\u2019s challenging is when there\u2019s a sudden sexiness to working in prisons and that work happens without talking to specialist organisations that exist, doing that work on a day to day basis for years.\u201d\nTo be a productive part of the rehabilitation process, she says, theatre has to be part of a sustained process of support. Clean Break\u2019s headquarters, tucked off Kentish Town Road, is a hidden oasis. Behind a secure door, a lush urban garden leads up to a light, airy building with several rehearsal studios and two small offices occupied by support workers. The two exist hand-in-hand. \u201cFor art to be forefronted, there has to be that safety net,\u201d says Herrmann. \u201cBy supporting people with court appearances or benefits claims, they\u2019re able to be here and create, taking the risks that artists can take. One enables the other.\u201d\nHowever, austerity has had a significant impact on Clean Break\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cdangerously so\u201d, according to McBrinn. Herrmann fleshes out the thought: \u201cLockdowns happen more often, safety levels have gone right down. All of which affects our practices and our access in prisons.\u201d The crisis that Clean Break and others are attempting to counter risks endangering the very work that they do.\nInside Bitch is at the Royal Court, London, 27 February-23 March.

        "content": "He is the only person to have scaled El Capitan without protective equipment, and the film about his feat has just won an Oscar. What drives someone to take the ultimate risk?\nThe greatest rock climber in the world is climbing the greatest rock in the world. Alex Honnold is on El Capitan, free-soloing it \u2013 meaning no rope, no one else, just a man alone on a wall. He is at the crux, the most difficult section, known as the boulder problem, the main problem being that it is really, really hard. But he moves gracefully, balletically even: drive up off the left foot into the thumb press, roll two fingers over the thumb, switch feet, left foot out to a bad sloping foothold, switch thumbs, reach out left to a grainy rounded hold before launching into the karate kick \u2026 And that is where he slips and falls.\nNot 700 metres to his death, though, which is what would have happened if he was on the real El Cap, in Yosemite, California. He is actually in Vauxhall, south London, at a climbing centre where they have tried to recreate the hardest section of the route that Honnold really did climb, alone and without a rope. So this time he has fallen about two and a half metres on to a crash mat, nothing hurt except a little pride. \u201cI\u2019m dead,\u201d he laughs. Hahaha.\nAlex Honnold, now 33, has been a legend in the sport for a while, with a rack of insane firsts and nobody-will-evers hanging from his harness (except he doesn\u2019t usually wear one of those). With a goofy grin and a bad haircut, he has been fighting a single-handed battle against gravity, and winning. When, on 3 June 2017, he free-soloed the freerider route on El Capitan, the New York Times described it as \u201cone of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, ever\u201d.\nThen the film about that climb \u2013 Free Solo \u2013 came out, and the world outside the climbing community sat up and took note. It is a brilliant, beautiful film \u2013 not just the story of an incredible physical performance (with some of the most buttock-clenchingly tense viewing you\u2019re ever likely to squirm through), but a very human story of a remarkable, beguiling character. Oh, and it\u2019s a love story, too. It has just won the Oscar for best documentary, after winning a Bafta earlier in the month.\nHonnold is in town to promote the film. You can\u2019t keep him away from climbing for long, though, even in the city, and this is where he comes when he is in London. It\u2019s not unlike the climbing wall where he started off in Sacramento, he says. There is a buzz about the place among the men and women who work here \u2013 imagine Lionel Messi dropping in to your amateur football club.\nThey have recreated this section of the boulder problem in his honour. But it\u2019s not quite right: this hold needs to come in a bit, the thumb press presses the wrong way, there shouldn\u2019t be a foothold on the end of the karate kick \u2026 He is telling them where everything should be from memory. He knows every millimetre of this section of El Capitan, practised it 40 or 50 times with a rope before attempting it without. That \u2013 the meticulous practice and preparation \u2013 is the key to not falling. If the recreated boulder problem was exactly the same as the real boulder problem, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.\nHonnold climbs because he loves it; he grew up doing it. \u201cI like the movement, I like swinging, it all feels kinda playful and fun.\u201d But why without a rope, when the stakes are so much higher? He has obviously been asked the question a thousand times before, but he still seems to think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I say that climbing is all about fun; free soloing is sort of the extreme. If you do something for fun all the time, every once in a while you want to have consequences.\u201d\nI speak to Jimmy Chin, who filmed a lot of Free Solo and co-directed it with his wife, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, after a screening of the documentary. A hugely accomplished climber himself, he says he wouldn\u2019t attempt to free-solo a single pitch of El Capitan, but he understands what drove Honnold. \u201cIf you had a superpower and you could fly, you would probably do it, right?\u201d he says. \u201cThe drive and ambition to do something that pushes you, that you love \u2013 it\u2019s hard to put that away and not use it.\u201d\nChin is in no doubt about what it meant to free-solo El Capitan, which he compares to an Olympic gold medal gymnastics floor routine. \u201cBut the floor routine is four hours long. And every single move, every second, you have to be performing perfectly, knowing that if you make a single mistake you would die.\u201d\nHonnold knew he wasn\u2019t going to fall off El Capitan because of the practice and preparation. What about all the other people mentioned in the film who have died free-soloing \u2013 people he knew, such as Ueli Steck? \u201cHe died climbing a mountain at 7,000 metres in the snow wearing crampons \u2013 it\u2019s a completely different experience,\u201d Honnold says. Another climbing legend, John Bachar? He did die free-soloing, but \u201cwith extenuating circumstances. He\u2019d been in this car accident and had nerve damage. He died soloing on something quite easy.\u201d\nDean Potter, a free-soloing pal of Honnold\u2019s who also features in the film, died while Base jumping: jumping off a cliff with a parachute. Honnold wouldn\u2019t do that, \u201cbecause everyone dies, honestly\u201d. He explains the difference in risk. With Base jumping, you die unless everything works perfectly \u2013 the parachute opens, you\u2019re facing the right way when it does etc. With free-soloing, you\u2019re OK unless something goes badly wrong.\nIf any of this talk about death \u2013 of people he knew and potentially his own \u2013 comes across as unfeeling or callous, it doesn\u2019t seem like that at the time. He just has a matter-of-fact directness that is arresting, but also honest and refreshing. He is not an adrenaline junkie thrill-seeker: he climbs because he loves to climb, not because of the danger of death. A lot of work goes into minimising that danger.\nHe boulders as we talk, picking his way up, sometimes three metres above me, stretched out, a human bridge between a couple of smears on the wall, then back down at ground level again. I have a go and I can\u2019t even get on to the beginning of the boulder problem; the idea of 600 metres of air below me is ridiculous. I try something easier and Honnold offers advice and encouragement from below. I do a bit of outdoor climbing, but I get scared high up on exposed routes. Keep on doing it until the fear goes away, he tells me.\nEventually, we sit down. It\u2019s freezing, so he puts on a jacket by a well-known outdoor clothing company. It pays him about what a well-paid dentist gets, he says in the film. Since then, it has become more \u201clike a really successful orthodontist\u201d, he admits. Anyway, he is no longer a dirtbagger living in a van, but has a house in Las Vegas. If Vegas seems an unlikely place for him, it has nothing to do with the city itself and everything to do with the fact it is surrounded by some of the best climbing in the country.\nHe lives with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, a life coach who plays a big part in Free Solo. That is the love story bit, although it\u2019s not easy dating a guy who crawls out of bed before dawn to go and hang off cliffs. When he reached the top of El Capitan after three hours 56 minutes (to put it in perspective, it took a German team of professional climbers doing it with ropes four days), with the biggest grin of his life, he called McCandless. \u201cI love you,\u201d he just about managed to say, awkwardly, before ruining it by downgrading it to: \u201cI appreciate you.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not really an I-love-you kind of guy, is he? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he agrees. Nor much of a hugger. That comes into the film, that there wasn\u2019t much hugging in his family growing up. One critic described it as \u201ca cautionary study of what can happen when you don\u2019t hug your children\u201d. But Honnold has taught himself to hug, he says, and he is getting better at it. Can I get one? Sure. We stand up and embrace; there is even a little shoulder- patting going on. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, huh?\u201d he says. It is \u2013 big strong arms.\nThe no-huggy thing is part of something else going on in the film. He doesn\u2019t always seem switched on to McCandless\u2019s emotional expectations. His remark that previous girlfriends have accused him of having a personality disorder; his obsessiveness; the extraordinary detail of his preparations and the pages and pages of notes; the fact that he began to climb alone in Yosemite because it was easier than asking people to climb with him; his mum saying his dad had Asperger\u2019s \u2026 It is implicit rather than explicit, but you could easily come away from watching Free Solo thinking that Honnold might have a rubber-soled toehold somewhere on the spectrum.\nHe recognises that people might think that, and that it is a seam in the film, and he is not surprised or in any way offended. He wouldn\u2019t mind if he did have a spectrum disorder, but he doesn\u2019t think he does and picks holes in some of the evidence. He was shy, is shy, doesn\u2019t like talking to strangers much now (my hug is feeling more and more special), but he also wanted to climb on his own \u2013 there is a strong tradition of it in Yosemite. The obsessive focus and detail? Any elite climber would and has to do the same.\nHe says he has no problem knowing what other people are thinking \u2013 McCandless, for example. \u201cI can tell she would prefer something different but, you know, do I have to? Is she going to leave me? No. So you\u2019re sort of like, well, I guess it\u2019s not that serious.\u201d Risk assessed, safe to continue, basically. He goes on: \u201cI have no problem knowing what other people are thinking on a rational level; I just don\u2019t always necessarily care. I\u2019m not necessarily compassionate, but I understand.\u201d Again, it might come across as callous, but it\u2019s also brutally frank.\nAs for his dad (who died when Alex was 18) having Asperger\u2019s, he disputes it. \u201cMum says that; I think it\u2019s slightly unfounded.\u201d He was never diagnosed. \u201cI would have for sure called him a kind of quirky man, and pretty quiet.\u201d\nIs that what Alex is? \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d He hasn\u2019t sought a professional opinion for himself, although he once did an online test, which he realises isn\u2019t rigorous. The result? \u201cTotally normal.\u201d\nAs we talk, he is often distracted, looking around or over my shoulder. Not, I think, because he doesn\u2019t like what I\u2019m asking or because he\u2019s finding the interaction awkward, but because there is something more interesting going on. We are, after all, at a climbing centre. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is the centre staff trying out the El Cap bouldering problem (every now and then, there is the sound of body on crash mat \u2013 another tragic death, we laugh), or the woman from the PR company, who has never climbed before, attempting the easiest route in the house. \u201cThat\u2019s it, keep straightening that leg, trust it, it\u2019s not that high, yes, you can,\u201d he calls up to her.\nDoes he like teaching? \u201cI like seeing people succeed,\u201d he says. McCandless, he says, is now \u201cpretty fricking good\u201d. She even likes doing it, which is lucky, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t see much of each other. Same if he \u2013 they \u2013 ever had kids: they would have to climb. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t, it would be hard to spend quality time together,\u201d he says.\nSpeaking of kids, Honnold has to run \u2013 to a school where he is giving a talk. First, though, he has to try the boulder problem again. They have taken on board what he said, moved the holds to where they should be, so it\u2019s near as dammit to the real thing. He switches thumbs, grabs the grainy hold, launches into the karate kick, and lands on the other wall \u2013 success.\nIn Free Solo, it is a key moment, the completion of the karate kick, and he turns to the camera with the biggest grin. There are still 300 or so metres of near-vertical granite to scale, a fiendish crack to work his way up. But, for Honnold, that\u2019s a walk in the park \u2013 he knows he\u2019s done it and that he\u2019s alive. Today he jumps down, thanks all the climbing centre guys, grabs his jacket and runs for the waiting car.\nFree Solo premieres on TV on National Geographic, Sunday 3 March at 8pm",

        "content": "Australia\u2019s Cardinal George Pell guilty of abusing two boys under 16 \u2026 Corbyn backs second referendum \u2026 and, Alan Partridge returns\nThis is Alison Rourke bringing you today\u2019s briefing.\nThe conviction and likely imprisonment of Cardinal George Pell, the third most senior Catholic in the world and the Vatican\u2019s treasurer, will send shockwaves through the church\u2019s global congregation. Once praised by Pope Francis for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, the Australian cardinal\u2019s reputation is in ruins after a jury in Melbourne found him guilty of five charges \u2013 one of sexually penetrating a child under 16 and four of an indecent act with a child under 16. The charges date back to 1996 and 1997, months after Pell was inaugurated as the city\u2019s archbishop. The jury found that he walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday mass and then manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. Pell then forced one of the boys\u2019 heads on to his penis, orally raping him. Once he had finished, Pell ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself.\nThe verdict was delivered in December but was subject to a suppression order because of a possible second trial, over different allegations, now dropped. Dozens of journalists and news outlets who alluded to the verdict at the time it was delivered face prosecutions and possible jail terms for contempt of court. It was the second time in the space of a few months that Pell had been tried for the crimes; in August he had faced a jury who were unable to reach a verdict.\nYou can read the inside account of the two trials here, by the Guardian\u2019s Melissa Davey, who sat through every day of evidence. You can read David Marr\u2019s account of how the \u201cbrutal and dogmatic\u201d Pell waged war on sex \u2013 even as he abused children. And you can read the Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood\u2019s take on the implications of Pell\u2019s conviction for the pope\u2019s push to rid the Catholic church of child abuse.\nCorbyn\u2019s change\u2013 The Labour party leader has finally put his weight behind a second Brexit referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if the party fails to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. It follows a concerted push by Keir Starmer and Tom Watson, who fear any further delay may have led to more defections to the Independent Group. A private briefing sent to Labour MPs last night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum. You can read about the implications for Labour of Corbyn\u2019s move here.\nMeanwhile, Theresa May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a cabinet rebellion this morning, before a vote on Wednesday on a cross-party amendment laid by the Tory Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. The PM\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March.\nIn other Brexit news, Britons could face five-hour airport queues in Spain in the event of no deal, with Alicante airport likely to be worst affected, according to Which?\nKashmir crisis \u2013 India has launched airstrikes on what it calls \u201cterror camps\u201d across the ceasefire line in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan said there was no damage or casualties in the first aerial bombing over the border since the two countries went to war in 1971. The operation comes amid the highest tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in years, after a suicide attack on a convoy carrying 2,500 Indian security personnel killed at least 40 earlier this month. India says its neighbour had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d in the attack. Pakistan denies any involvement.\nDepression \u2013 Women working more than 55 hours a week are more likely to suffer than those who work 35-40 hours, a study has found. In contrast, men who put in the same hours are no more likely to exhibit signs of depression. Researchers who carried out the study, based on 20,000 British adults, suggests this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners. Women are also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday (4.6% and 3.4% more likely).\nUnwanted sexual behaviour \u2013 More than half of students at UK universities say they are victims of unwanted advances and assault, but only a fraction reported the incidents. The behaviour ranged from explicit messages to rape, new research for the charity Brook and the student database Dig-In shows. A survey of 5,649 students found many admitted a lack of understanding of what legally constitutes sexual harassment and violence. The study, conducted in January, showed 53% of respondents said they had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour.\nSleep like a baby? \u2013 Starting a family is a well-known sleep killer, but new research suggests the exhaustion might go on for six years. Researchers at the University of Warwick tracking the sleep of thousands of men and women found sleep hits a low about three months after birth \u2013 with the effect strongest in women. The team found the impact of the first child lingered for both parents. Even once the impact of subsequent children was taken into account, women were still relatively sleep deprived, both in terms of quality and quantity, four to six years after their first child\u2019s birth.\nMore warm weather \u2013 The Met Office says today\u2019s temperatures could rival Monday\u2019s record-breaking highs, where three places in the UK pushed the mercury over 20C. \u201cWe could well again see similar values,\u201d the Met\u2019s Luke Miall said. \u201cWhether it will be record-breaking again, we\u2019re not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close.\u201d The day is likely to start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about 19 or 20C. North-west Wales and London are most likely to feel the highest temperatures.\nAfter a picture of 64-year-old Stephen Smith\u2019s emaciated frame went viral, the Department for Work and Pensions apologised for passing him fit to work. It was the latest example of how reforms to disability benefits are hitting some of Britain\u2019s most disadvantaged people. The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Butler explains how we got here. Plus: Polly Toynbee welcomes Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s move towards backing a new Brexit referendum.\nAlan Partridge\u2019s return to TV is an excruciating white-knuckle ride, writes Lucy Mangan. After half an hour in his appalling company, you\u2019ll be limp from laughter, loathing, panic and despair. It\u2019s the character\u2019s first proper run-out since his 2013 feature film Alpha Papa, and is co-written and directed by twin brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who have become not just keepers of the flame but fuel and bellows for it too.\nThis Time brings Alan back, in all his glory and his tragedy, at just the right time. He surely voted Leave but, as a man of no convictions or courage, must now want to remain. We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still.\nEvidence supplied by Dario Gradi related to the Barry Bennell scandal can be revealed by the Guardian and includes an admission that he encouraged the culture at Crewe Alexandra for coaches to invite boys to stay overnight, or even take them on holidays abroad.\nDavid Luiz has delivered a public show of support for Maurizio Sarri and insisted Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s refusal to be substituted late in the Carabao Cup final was not indicative of a lack of respect within the Chelsea squad for their beleaguered head coach.\nJarrell \u201cBig Baby\u201d Miller has claimed, with no evidence, that the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua has used performance-enhancing drugs.\nEngland Women fell to a seven-wicket defeat against India in the second one-day international in Mumbai as the hosts secured victory in the series, while the men\u2019s third ODI against West Indies in Grenada was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain.\nMaro Itoje has not been deemed fit enough to take a full part in England\u2019s Six Nations training camp in Oxford this week and Charlie Ewels has been called up in place of the injured Courtney Lawes.\nThe plane that crashed in the Channel carrying the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn.\nAnd the Guardian won two awards and was highly commended in four other categories at the Sports Journalists\u2019 Association awards; Donald McRae was named sports feature writer of the year while Daniel Taylor was named football writer of the year.\nAsian shares lost steam on Tuesday after scaling a five-month high as investors waited to see if Washington and Beijing could clinch a trade deal. Meanwhile, sterling jumped to a near four-week high ($1.3149) in early Asian trading after Bloomberg reported Theresa May could allow her cabinet to discuss extending the Brexit deadline beyond 29 March at a meeting later today.\nThe pound is buying $1.31 and \u20ac1.16.\nLabour\u2019s announcement it would back a second Brexit referendum leads most front pages today, many of which went to print before the Cardinal Pell news. Most also carry pictures of a triumphant Olivia Colman.\nThe Daily Mirror says \u201cCorbyn backs second Brexit vote\u201d, the Daily Telegraph has: \u201cCorbyn comes out for second referendum\u201d, the Times reports: \u201cLabour will back second referendum on Brexit\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cCorbyn: we\u2019ll back a public vote to stop Tory Brexit\u201d, the i has: \u201cLabour offers second public vote on Brexit\u201d and the Financial Times reports: \u201cLabour reshapes Brexit debate by backing second referendum\u201d. The Daily Express is furious about Corbyn\u2019s talk of a second vote, saying: \u201cOur final say on Brexit was June 23 2016!\u201d\nThe Daily Mail has a different Brexit story as its lead, reporting that there has been a mass revolt by ministers who do not want the country leaving the EU without a deal: \u201c15 ministers in threat to quit\u201d.\nThe Sun has a story about the fact the UK experienced its hottest winter day ever, though the paper doesn\u2019t condemn it as a climate catastrophe, instead reporting the weather news as \u201cFabruary\u201d.\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

It has also been claimed that the company\u2019s chief executive, honorary Liberal party treasurer Andrew Burnes, secured a meeting with Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, who is also one of the top shareholders in Helloworld, with an investment worth more than $1m.\nIt has now emerged that a local Helloworld franchisee is sponsoring a small fundraiser for the Victorian Liberal party\u2019s Gardenvale branch this weekend.

        "content": "Former choirboy died of accidental heroin overdose in 2014 at the age of 30\n Follow live updates on Pell\u2019s conviction\nFull report: Pell found guilty of child sexual assault\nThe father of one of the choirboys sexually assaulted by Cardinal George Pell has said he will sue Pell and the church after the death of his son following an accidental overdose.\nPell has been convicted of sexually abusing two boys in 1996 and 1997, when they were 13 and members of the St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral choir. Pell, who was the archbishop of Melbourne at the time, was convicted on the evidence of one of the victims, now 35.\nThe man, who cannot be named, released a statement on Tuesday saying he had experienced \u201cshame, loneliness, depression and struggle\u201d as a result of the abuse.\n\u201cAt some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust.\u201d\nLawyers representing the father of the other victim said the guilty conviction had compelled him to speak out. He believes his son suffered post-traumatic stress disorder because he had been abused.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nThe son died of a heroin overdose in 2014, aged 30. He never spoke to his parents about being abused. But his father now believes that was the reason his son turned to drugs.\nThe legal firm Shine is representing the father. Shine\u2019\u2019s national special counsel for social justice, Leanne McDonald, said the father hoped to bring a civil claim against the church, and possibly against Pell personally.\n\u201cIt is very common for survivors of sexual abuse to turn to drugs as a way to black out the abuse,\u201d McDonald told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cIt is so terrifying for them to come forward. One of the good things that has come out of this conviction today is that it shows people that it doesn\u2019t matter how high up or important you are, you can be held to account. Survivors are seeing through today\u2019s news and things like the royal commission that they will be believed and will be listened to.\n\u201cThe more we start talking about this, the safer kids will be.\u201d\nA statement issued by Shine\u2019s head of specialist personal injury, Lisa Flynn, said the father \u201cwill allege that Pell has blood on his hands\u201d.\nPell has maintained his innocence of all the charges and his lawyers have lodged an appeal against his conviction.\nA sentencing hearing will be held in Melbourne on Wednesday.\n On 27 February 2019 this article was amended to correct the age at which the victim died. A previous version said he was 31.",

        "content": "The Whanganui is so important in Maori culture it has the legal rights of a person. A canoe trip along its forested valley proves a great way of getting to know it\nIf my canoe makes a noise when I smash sideways into the rock, I don\u2019t hear it. The rapids drown everything. For a moment the canoe is stationary, then it fills with water and tips me out. I try to swim to the bank but make no headway against the current. I remember that the Maoris say their ancestors dwell in the river and I wonder if I am about to become intimately acquainted with them.\nI have spent three days on the Whanganui River in New Zealand\u2019s North Island. The Whanganui is the country\u2019s longest navigable river, yet it is notable for more than that \u2013 because this is a river that is also a person. In 2017, the local Maoris gained a ruling to give the river the legal status of personhood. \u201cThe river has always been a living entity to us,\u201d Maori campaigner Gerrard Albert told me.\nHe believes the river\u2019s status will protect it: \u201cEveryone has to be conscious that the river has the right to continue to be in a healthy state.\u201d\nIn 2014, the Te Urewera wilderness area on its eastern side also assumed the rights of a legal person. And last year nearby Mount Taranaki gained the same status. The Maoris believe there are no boundaries between themselves and the natural world: it is a continuum.\nThe river\u2019s representatives are now waiting for the results of a study into its wellbeing. There are concerns about pollution from agriculture and damage from hydroelectric power schemes. The representatives are also deciding how to allocate a NZ$30m (\u00a316m) fund for environmental initiatives.\nThe Whanganui rises near Mount Tongariro. According to Maori legend the river was created after Mount Taranaki ran away to its present position on the east coast and left a gash behind. Afterwards Mount Tongariro healed the wound with water and the Whanganui was born.\nMy guide, Hemi Gray, grew up in the mountains. He\u2019s a mountain of a man himself, with a monolithic torso and shoulders. We join the river at the way station of Whakahoro, where I\u2019ve slept in former sheep shearers\u2019 quarters at the Blue Duck Station.\nThe pulsing melodies of bellbirds fill the air, and the view is of a valley packed with spiky cabbage trees, palms and giant tree ferns. Significantly, there are conifers, too. \u201cYou see conifers where there have been human settlements,\u201d says Hemi. The area was farmed up to the 1950s before nature reclaimed it.\nAs we begin canoeing I can see the forest continuing down the gorge. The high walls to either side and the saturation of greenery create an enclosed world. It\u2019s intensely peaceful \u2013 often we go an hour or more without encountering another vessel \u2013 but there is always something to see.\nA pair of mallards chug past. I also see kereru, New Zealand\u2019s large native wood pigeons, calling to each other. A large circular lesion in the gorge wall, framed by ferns and creepers, is Tamatea\u2019s Cave, a sacred place named for an early Maori explorer. Soon after, a couple of wild goats trot along the bank and turn to stare at us.\nA day-and-a-half of paddling brings us to the Bridge to Nowhere, a monument to the failed hopes of settlers. The concrete bridge was finished in 1936, but within a few years most of the farms to either side had been abandoned. The bridge spans a deep cleft over a tributary of the Whanganui, and in the water far below I can see eels more than a metre long and thicker than my arm (though not Hemi\u2019s).\nThat evening we stop at the Maori settlement of Tieke Kainga, where we\u2019re to sleep in the community\u2019s marae, or meeting house. After landing we take part in a powhiri, or greeting ritual, with its kaitiaki (guardian), Woody Firmin. Part of this means us singing a song \u2013 our Fr\u00e8re Jacques is incongruous, but well-received. Then it\u2019s on to the marae\u2019s version of a hangi, or pit oven, for a meal Firmin prepared by wrapping chicken, lamb and sweet potato in leaves and letting them cook over hot stones.\nThe final day brings the rapids. Oblivious to Hemi\u2019s instructions, I paddle left instead of right and hit the rock. Fortunately he\u2019s at hand to haul me, gasping, on to the bank. Notwithstanding my involuntary baptism I can see why \u2013 even though it is not actually a walk \u2013 canoeing or kayaking the Whanganui is one of New Zealand\u2019s 10 Great Walks.\nReturning to the tumult of the world is hard, but it is consoling to recall Firmin\u2019s farewell: \u201cYou\u2019ll always be a part of the river now. And you\u2019ll be a part of us, too.\u201d\n The trip was provided by Tourism New Zealand (tourismnewzealand.com) and Singapore Airlines (singaporeair.com). An all-inclusive three-day trip with Unique Whanganui River Experience (uniquewhanganuiriver.co.nz) is \u00a3588pp. Canoes or kayaks may be hired for independent trips (from \u00a390pp for three to five days), but prior experience is advisable",

However, Medact has previously released research showing that those recruited into the army as children are more likely to encounter trauma and have a greater likelihood of injury and death than those who signed up when they were adults \u2013 not least because young recruits are more likely to be sent to the frontline when they are old enough.\nAbu-Hayyeh and Singh also pointed out that war-zone conditions could increase the risk of mental health problems, particularly for young and vulnerable recruits. \u201cThe army isn\u2019t a good place for those who have faced childhood adversity,\u201d added Abu-Hayyeh.\nWhile proponents claimed it was necessary to recruit under-18s to bolster numbers, Abu-Hayyeh said the harm done to young people did not justify the practice. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a good enough answer,\u201d she said, adding that about a quarter of child recruits leave the armed forces before they have completed four years of service.\nAn Army spokesperson said: \u201cWe strongly dispute many of the assertions in this article, which are based on the assumption that under 18s are deployed in front line combat roles. This is not the case as 16-18 year old trainee soldiers are not deployed on combat operations and are able to leave employment at any point before their 18th birthday. It is also untrue to suggest we predominantly recruit from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d",

You move quickly too.\nOnly four weeks ago I mentioned that you\u2019re recommending that our children climb trees. \u201cBluntly,\u201d you said, \u201cit is about doing stuff that doesn\u2019t involve looking at a screen.\u201d\nAs I read this, I wondered what policies you were going to introduce that would take children of today back to my Swallows and Amazons childhood. Perhaps the department would sink millions into supporting my colleague Michael Morpurgo\u2019s fantastic Farms for City Children, or any of the other available field centres? I envisaged an archipelago of such places across the country, with enough qualified teachers and free places for every single child.\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to have happened. In fact, a different initiative seems to have sprouted: your department is going to \u201cpay for learning apps for poor families\u201d.\nI know I have a partial interest here as a contributor, but isn\u2019t the BBC free at the point of delivery and doesn\u2019t it have a range of free materials that come out of CBBC, CBeebies and BBC Bitesize? Haven\u2019t we already paid for these? And there are thousands of other free educational sites online.\nThen I thought back to what you were saying a few weeks ago. Are you saying you want us to get our children on to screens to look at your free apps, but get them off screens to go climbing trees?\nExcuse me for sounding confused. As a parent on the edge of my children\u2019s learning, confusion goes with the job. I remember a parents\u2019 evening when we were being told how our children were going to be taught to read. Two teachers acted out the word \u201cbat\u201d being made from \u201cb\u201d and \u201cat\u201d. One was the character \u201cb\u201d and the other was \u201cat\u201d and they sidled up to each other and \u201cblended\u201d into \u201cbat\u201d. We shouldn\u2019t try this at home, they said.\nSomeone asked if we should help our children to read the words in their library books, and the adviser said no. That was me stumped.\nQuite a few of us are in the midst of helping our children choose which subjects to take at GCSE. This used to be a matter of choosing a core of English, maths, science and a language, then adding on other subjects depending on the child\u2019s interest and the logistics of the timetable. Bit by bit, the whole thing has turned into a complex three-dimensional model, with moving parts involving alien terms.\nIt\u2019s become a sci-fi film. Every time I say something parental such as, \u201cYou like geography, don\u2019t you?\u201d, I am sucked through a portal to meet the aliens: bucket, Ebacc and progress 8. I\u2019m sure you know, these are the real names of what we have to consider when choosing GCSEs in England. None of them appear to speak in plain English.\nFor a brief moment, though, my sense of panic and bewilderment was lifted when I heard that the Conservative MP and chair of the Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, was recommending that GCSEs should be scrapped. Yes!!!\nI was in the courthouse at the end of Alice in Wonderland, the whole GCSE caboodle collapsing like a pack of cards. Then I woke up. And I was in a bucket. If you\u2019re in government when you\u2019re reading this, or if there is still a government, please follow your education chair\u2019s advice, and abolish them.\nYours, Michael Rosen",

        "content": "Madeleine Warren\u2019s life depends on imported supplies for her daily kidney dialysis\nA woman who has been on kidney dialysis for 21 years has told how she fears she could die in a no-deal Brexit because irresponsible politicians are playing with people\u2019s lives.\nShe says she is so concerned that she is prepared to go on dialysis strike outside Downing Street to drive home the dangers facing her and other home dialysis patients.\nMadeleine Warren needs a daily supply of 15 consumables including syringes, blood lines and acid fluid to allow her to conduct home dialysis five nights a week, but the supply is threatened in a no-deal scenario as half of the items are made in the EU.\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t get my dialysis supplies, it would kill me,\u201d said Warren, a former executive at Goldman Sachs. \u201cIf there was serious disruption to certain supplies and you couldn\u2019t do dialysis, then within a week you could die.\u201d\nShe spoke out as the government moved to try to reassure the public that medical supplies were secure in the event of crashing out of the EU. The government revealed it has created a logistics hub in Belgium where vital medical supplies will be stockpiled to stop the NHS running out.\nWarren says she does not feel reassured by the government statements. \u201cI am very aware that my condition is very serious. Things have happened before that have threatened my life and I am basically relying on a machine to keep me alive,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn my mind I\u2019ve always thought if there was a war or an earthquake I could die, but I never thought it would be our government that would be creating that uncertainty over supplies. For this to be a political decision is beyond insane.\u201d\nDiagnosed with kidney failure when she was 13 after she was struck by an auto-immune condition, Warren explains that renal patients have to be vigilant about potassium and phosphates, minerals that for healthy are of little concern for healthy people.\nHigh levels of potassium can cause heart failure within a week. Such is the fine line between life and death caused by toxins, that those on dialysis in hospitals two or three times a week have to limit fluid intake including water, tea and coffee to just 500ml to 800ml a day.\nAfter years of dialysis in hospital, Warren now rinses her blood while she is sleeping five nights a week.\nA lorry delivers supplies to her home every month as all the devices or consumables in the dialysis process have to be changed each time to guard against infection. She fears any disruption in the EU supply chain to Britain could cost her dearly.\n\u201cStock management is critical. I treat running my machine like a second job,\u201d she says.\nWarren adds that she has had no reassurance that supplies will be secure either from the renal unit at the hospital or the government.\n\u201cI am not a scaremonger but I already have experience of what even the smallest disruption can cause. If one of the 15 items is missing I can\u2019t do the dialysis. My entire life depends on this machine working.\u201d\nWarren is speaking out because she feels the government does not know the danger that people like her feel in, otherwise it would have taken a no-deal Brexit off the table.\n\u201cPeople know about cancer, they know it is very serious, but they don\u2019t know that if you don\u2019t have kidneys you can die very rapidly.\u201d\nWarren says she is prepared to \u201cgo on strike\u201d outside Downing Street to make her point. \u201cThere are a group of people in power who have the power to do something about this and they are not doing it.\u201d\nFiona Loud, the policy director of Kidney Care UK, said Monday\u2019s statement on medical supplies wasn\u2019t specific enough for people like Warren. \n \u201cWe need clarification from the government to help us understand how our exit from the EU will affect kidney patients. Kidney disease is hard enough to live with, without the extra stress and worry that this is causing thousands of patients in the UK.\u201d\nShe was speaking just hours after the government issued more details of its plans for stockpiles of medical supplies. It said it had put in place national contingency measures to ensure supply, including additional daily air freight capacity from Maastricht to Birmingham, as well as ferries.\n\u201cWhile we never give guarantees, we are confident that, if everyone \u2013 including suppliers, freight companies, international partners and the health and care system \u2013 does what they need to do, the supply of medicines and medical products should be uninterrupted in the event of exiting the EU without a deal,\u201d said the health minister, Stephen Hammond.",

The symbol is intended to reassure consumers that the products do not contain plastic and will break down in the sewer system instead of clogging up sewers.\nHowever, most brands still adhere to standards set by the European industry body Edana allowing products to be labelled as \u201cflushable\u201d even though they do not break down quickly when they enter the sewer system. Many are full of plastic or wood pulp.\nWater UK considers these tests to be less rigorous than its own because they fail to replicate conditions inside sewers. Its own tests \u2013 which cost \u00a38,000 a time \u2013 look for plastics and residuals that could contaminate rivers, estuaries and the sea.\nThe new Natracare wipes are plastic free and compostable, and will be sold in Waitrose, Ocado and independent health shops.\nCities around the world are growing used to the problem of subterranean fatbergs, which are caused mainly by a buildup of wet wipes, fats, oils and grease into a solid mass. There was a 250-metre blockage in Whitechapel in London in 2017, and last week a 84-metre fatberg was discovered in a sewer in Liverpool.\nAndy Drinkwater, the lead engineer for sewage and flooding at the Water Research Centre said: \u201cWet wipes, along with fat, oils and grease, have been a major issue for water and sewerage companies. Our new universal standard accurately analyses what is happening in the drains so that consumers can be better informed about which products are safe to flush.\u201d\nIn 2017, the biggest investigation of sewer blockages in UK history showed non-flushable wet wipes could account for about 93% of the material causing blockages.\n This article was amended on 26 February 2019. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the Water Research Centre is part of Water UK. This has been corrected.",

        "content": "As B-day looms, this week\u2019s Cooper-Letwin amendment will play a crucial role\nWelcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing, even more essential reading now that there\u2019s barely a month before B-day. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here.\nProducing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please support us. Thank you.\nOn and on and on it goes. Sparking a fierce backlash, Theresa May delayed MPs\u2019 next \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote on her Brexit deal until 12 March \u2013 barely a fortnight before Britain is due to leave the EU (a feat she described as \u201cstill within our grasp\u201d).\nThe prime minister also insisted Brexit \u201cmust not, will not be blocked\u201d, and dismissed pressure on her to step down after senior government figures told the Guardian she should go once the first phase of Brexit is delivered or face a no-confidence vote in parliament.\nFaced with yet more can-kicking, an increasingly exasperated EU27 \u2013 determined to avoid the uncertainty of repeated three-month extension requests \u2013 let it be known it might just prefer delaying Brexit until 2021 while the UK sorts itself out.\nWith the EU unwilling to make the kind of \u201clegally binding changes\u201d to the Irish backstop that Britain wants, the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was now a high chance of an \u201caccidental\u201d no-deal Brexit.\nBut as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, seeks to translate the bloc\u2019s earlier assurances over the temporary nature of the backstop into a legal protocol acceptable to hardline Brexiters, Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said the EU would favour an article 50 extension as a \u201crational solution\u201d if the deal is not ratified soon.\nMay continues to insist she does not want an extension. But up to 25 members of her government, including four cabinet ministers \u2013 David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell \u2013 are ready to vote for a Brexit delay, while dozens of moderate Conservative MPs are also prepared to vote against the government to avoid no deal.\nLabour, meanwhile, has finally come off the fence, saying it will back a second vote if parliament rejects a plan it will table this week for a permanent and comprehensive customs union and close alignment with the single market. Jeremy Corbyn said the party would also back the Cooper-Letwin amendment (see below) to avert no deal.\nWith eight Labour MPs having now left the opposition party to form the Independent Group, May was further weakened by the decision of three moderate Conservatives to join them over her Brexit policy. The move by Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen underlines how the PM has now exhausted many of her MPs\u2019 patience.\nOn the good news front, analysts predicted that UK food imports from the EU would face a \u00a39bn tariff bill under a no-deal Brexit, with retailers warning of tariffs of up to 40% being imposed on key foodstuffs if the UK crashes out without an agreement.\nThe final Brexit countdown is now under way. Crucial to it is an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin. This would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.\nIf the Cooper-Letwin amendment passes and Cox succeeds in coming up with some form of codicil making the non-permanent nature of the backstop solid enough to satisfy the Brexiters, the amended deal \u2013 with the alternative being a very long article 50 extension \u2013 could conceivably win Commons approval on 13 March.\nMay would then, inevitably, have to ask for a brief extension, maybe two months, to get the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the full Brexit legislation \u2013 through parliament. The EU27 could sign off on the deal at their summit on 21/22 March. And Brexit might then (after a lot of ifs and buts) happen at the beginning of the summer.\nA lot, though, could still go wrong for May, including mass resignations from the government by members determined to ensure a no-deal Brexit is averted by voting for Cooper-Letwin. And MPs could also, of course, vote for that promised Labour amendment calling for a second referendum. It is not over yet.\nNo-deal Brexit: should you buy your holiday money now?\nEU offers lucrative tax breaks to firm of billionaire Brexiter.\nUK driving licences will not be valid in Ireland under no-deal Brexit.\nIreland steps up effort to shelter economy from no-deal Brexit.\nNo-deal Brexit \u201ccould disrupt London commuter trains\u201d.\nHonda\u2019s 2018 briefing undermines claim plant closure not Brexit-related.\nJeremy Corbyn inching closer to backing a second referendum.\nUK public finances hit record surplus to give Hammond pre-Brexit boost.\nCBI pushing hard for UK and EU to find Brexit compromise.\nBritons may need \u00a352 visa to visit mainland Europe after Brexit.\nPay farmers to avoid cull of lambs after no-deal Brexit, union says.\nHonda\u2019s decision is a vote of no confidence in Britain\u2019s future.\nBritain\u2019s EU workforce in decline as numbers from elsewhere soar.\nUK will apply food tariffs in case of no deal, Michael Gove says.\nIn the Guardian, Aditya Chakrabortty argues that if Labour aids a Tory Brexit, it will be heavily punished at the next elections:\nUnless something major changes, the end of next month will launch the Rees-Mogg revolution, a reconfiguration of British society as drastic as that begun by Margaret Thatcher. Why would the British left so blithely enable a Tory project that seeks to cripple it all over again? As Brexit fails to get through parliament, Corbyn should stop pushing for a compromise deal. Instead, Labour should get behind a second referendum. Leave voters would not punish Labour at the next election anywhere near as badly as its remain base: just 36% of Labour leave voters rank Brexit in the top three topics they care about; for Labour remainers, that shoots up to 60%.\nIn the Observer, Will Hutton says Honda\u2019s decision to close its Swindon plant signals the end of a profitable industrial relationship decades in the making:\nA new Japanese consensus has formed. The Conservative party and its leaders cannot be trusted. They ignore warnings, break their word and do not understand business \u2013 personified by Old Etonians Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Brexit is a first-order disaster, striking at the heart of how Japanese companies organise themselves as \u201clean manufacturers\u201d. Japanese inward investment mitigated our own failures and is now on its way out. Britain has many more bitter pills to swallow before this whole contemptible business is over.\nAlexander Clarkson calls it \u201cEscher Brexit\u201d, and you can see why:\nTo recap: The UK is threatening self-harm to bluff the EU into altering a treaty commitment that limits the UK's ability to take back control to win a vote in UK parliament over a deal under which for years the UK state will have to enforce EU law over which the UK has no control",

        "content": "Rising BME support for Labour and diversity in Tory seats could be pivotal\nSharp rises in support for Labour among minority ethnic voters at the last general election and the increasing diversity of Conservative constituencies mean the Tories face a tough challenge to maintain power the next time Britain goes to the polls, research published on Monday suggests.\nLabour increased its traditionally loyal support from minority ethnic voters in 2017, with 77% of those who voted choosing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party, up from two-thirds in 2010, according to research by Runnymede, a race equality thinktank. By contrast, the Conservatives managed to win only 16 seats where 30% or more of the electorate were from an ethnic minority, losing support it had gained in 2010 when it won 27 such seats.\n\u201cA larger share of BME voters supported Brexit than have ever voted for the Conservative party, although there are now differences in support among different ethnic minority groups,\u201d said Omar Khan, the director of Runnymede. \u201cIf Theresa May had held on to the diverse seats won by David Cameron in 2010 she would have an outright majority.\u201d\nThe research by Runnymede estimated that around 1 in 10 of the registered voters at the 2017 election were from a minority background, the equivalent of 4.8 million people and an increase of 10% since 2010. For every black person there were two Asian voters and there were marked increases in Pakistani and Bangladeshi votes for Labour between 2010 and 2017, with less than 10% of people from these backgrounds voting Conservative.\nOne in five Labour voters were from ethnic minorities compared with one in 20 voters for Conservative candidates, and Muslim support for Labour rose from 74% to 87% between 2015 and 2017, according to Runnymede\u2019s analysis of Understanding Society, an official household longitudinal study that allows researchers to look at how voting patterns have changed. The proportion of the minority ethnic vote that went to Labour was in line with opinion polling conducted after the election.\n\u201cIn 2017 we went backwards,\u201d said Binita Mehta-Parmar, a leading Conservative party campaigner, speaking at the launch of the Runnymede research in Westminster. \u201cIt was the ethnic minority vote gap that lost us our majority in that election. The party\u2019s single-minded focus on white working-class voters \u2026 alienated BME voters. Britain\u2019s BME population is becoming increasingly critical. Ethnic minority communities are dispersing to towns, suburbs and coasts. The Conservatives will need to take parliamentary seats we have ignored for decades.\u201d\nNicole Martin of the University of Manchester, who authored the Runnymede report, said approximately a third of BME voters backed Brexit, with British Indians and African-Caribbean people most likely to vote to leave the European Union.\nSeema Malhotra, the Labour MP for Feltham and Heston in west London, which is 45% white and 41% Asian, said there was a feeling that Brexit would allow greater Commonwealth immigration. She said that Brexit was also a protest vote about housing and work issues that disproportionately affected ethnic minorities, who are statistically more likely to be poor.\nBut she warned Labour against complacency and said: \u201cNot all minority voting is on minority lines in terms of historical loyalty to the Labour party. It is also a story of aspiration and there is an issue about how we respond to that. We have got to realise we need to reach the aspirational vote.\u201d\nThe Runnymede report concludes: \u201cThe 2017 parliament is the most ethnically diverse on record; yet this change in who our representatives are has not been matched by changes in ethnic minority voting patterns.\u201d",

While some told us of good relationships, many others raised serious concerns.\nFrancis, a 23-year-old trans man, was outed to other medics by his GP. \u201cI needed a referral to a neurologist and I ended up having a brain scan \u2013 and the referral to the neurologist mentioned that I was trans,\u201d he says. \u201cI admit there are times when you might have to mention it otherwise it\u2019ll be confusing, but I don\u2019t think a brain scan is one of those times.\u201d\nWin Wyatt, an 18-year-old trans man, was told he needed to come out as trans to his parents before receiving any further help. Getting hold of prescriptions, he said, could be difficult: one situation at a pharmacy involved having to disclose he was trans in front of a queue of people.\n\u201cIt was the pill,\u201d he said. \u201cI was stood at the counter for an hour and a half because they were very confused as to why they were giving me this medication because obviously my biological gender marker or whatever was not marked on my prescription and my name was Winston Wyatt. And they were like, \u2018this is not for you\u2019 and I was like, \u2018it is, it is for me actually\u2019.\u201d\nAli Brumfitt, 45, who identifies as gender queer,went to the doctor to talk about difficulties relating to the menopause. But the GP insisted that Brumfitt explain whether they were \u201ca man or a woman now\u201d. \u201cI was like, \u2018well, I was assigned female at birth and I am not taking hormones \u2026 and I do have a womb\u2019,\u201d said Brumfitt.\nBut that was not enough for the doctor. \u201c\u2018Look, I am just trying to get my head around it\u2019, is what he said to me. \u2018Are you a man or a woman? And were you born a man or a woman and what are you now?\u2019,\u201d Brumfitt recalls. \u201cHe just was really angry with me, he was very patronising. And I was in tears and shaking by this point.\u201d\nJack Doyle, 26, a graduate student who acts as a healthcare advocate for trans people, said having to be an expert in their own healthcare puts a huge strain on trans men and women.\n\u201cIt essentially makes a really life-saving kind of care dependant on your ability to be resilient, and to be prepared to go through something that I think a lot of patients don\u2019t ever have to go through in terms of being vulnerable and being willing to have basic dignity and selfhood challenged,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd a lot of people can\u2019t do that, a lot of people just can\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t go to the doctors any more, they stop going on care, they self-medicate, or they self-harm, or they they experience suicidal ideation and that is often where we as advocates actually have to step in and unfortunately not enough people know that advocacy is an option.\u201d\nCharlie Knowles, a 19-year-old trans man, said he was left distraught after it emerged his referral to a gender identity clinic had been lost \u2013 something he only discovered after waiting almost two years for an appointment.\n\u201cI remember sitting on the bus on the way home and just crying because I knew I was then looking at another two-year waiting list,\u201d he said, adding that his life was now on hold. \u201cI was going to uni in September 2018 but I didn\u2019t end up going\u2026 I really badly wanted to have started at least some sort of hormone therapy or something before I made that big sort of change in my life. I wanted to go into uni as myself rather than, like, I look like a prepubescent teenage boy.\u201d\nKimberley, a 31-year-old trans woman, was initially, and wrongly, sent to mental health services after talking to her GP in 2016. Six months later she was referred to a GIC \u2013 but has yet to have an appointment. She said the lack of contact after the initial acknowledgement left her feeling very alone. \u201cUnless you keep pushing you don\u2019t hear anything. I have received nothing from the clinics themselves since I was referred,\u201d she said.\nThe idea of surgery was a distant thought, given that that was only considered by doctors after an individual had been seen at a GIC, and been on hormones for a certain time, Kimberley said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it is ever going to happen because it is just this constant thing of waiting, and because I have not heard anything, because nobody gets in contact, if I am having any problems I am here on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nobody who understands that can talk through it with me.\u201d\nEdward Smith, a 23-year-old trans man, also experienced problems with communication after his referral. \u201cI have just not heard anything at all from the gender identity clinic. I have not had a letter, I have not had any receipt of confirmation,\u201d he said.\nThe prospect of a lengthy wait left him feeling down and drove him to seek private healthcare in the interim. \u201cI am going to a clinic in London and it was a big decision for me because it is a lot of my savings I am spending on these appointments but that is the only thing that has really given me some hope that things are going to get better in a relatively less-bad time frame,\u201d Smith said.\nAccess to healthcare, he added, was a key concern for trans men and women. \u201cI see a lot of articles that are \u2026 sensationalising things or trying to create some controversy over things like what toilets we use and things like that. But actually I think this is the biggest thing that affects transgender people\u2019s lives and this is what we struggle with, getting the healthcare we need. We just want to get on with our lives and just live normal lives really.\u201d\n\u201cI do feel nervous about going [to the GP], particularly anything where I am going to have to mention anything about gender and/or surgery, because I feel they then go off on a complete tangent,\u201d said Brumfitt. \u201cA bit like if you are obese, they just think everything that is wrong with you is because you are fat.\u201d\nEric, a 36-year-old trans man, expressed similar concerns. \u201c I have never been a massive fan of going to the doctor for every little thing anyway, but I will avoid it probably longer than I should,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I should be going to see the GP at the moment for something completely unrelated to gender identity, hormones or anything else and I have been putting it off for quite some time,\u201d he said. The presence of gender dysphoria and contact with mental health professionals on his records meant such topics were invariably raised, regardless of why he was visiting the GP, he said.\nAnnabelle, 38, a trans woman, tried to find out what updating her gender marker to female on her records would mean for her medical care after her practice manager asked if she would like it to be changed.\n\u201cI was like I don\u2019t know actually because what are the implications for managing my health provision moving forwards?,\u201d she said, adding that, for example, in the case of an accident it would be important for doctors to know she would not be expected to be pregnant. The upshot was a phone call that lasted around two hours. \u201cI was trying to ask them what the medical implications were of them changing my gender marker on my notes and they were trying to do the politically correct thing of saying well it is what you want, it is not about what we want.\u201d\nIn the end Annabelle had her gender marker updated. A week later she received a letter inviting her for cervical screening \u2013 despite not having such anatomy.\nSome have complained about a lack of information on how health matters common to cis men and women might affect those who are gender queer or who transition to a different gender.\n\u201cIt is bad enough trying to find info on menopause but trying to find something on how it affects someone like me has been really, really difficult,\u201d said Brumfitt.\nKimberley was told by her GP that he would only take over prescribing hormone therapy if she was self-medicating. So that\u2019s what she did \u2013 but no help was given. \u201cI have had to do it all on my own, which of course is incredibly risky,\u201d she said, although she said the medication has been very beneficial to her.\nWhat\u2019s more, after disclosing the source of her hormones, Kimberley found the website was soon shut down. \u201cI went into withdrawal and within six weeks I had spent a night in hospital because I had tried to kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were a couple of additional factors, things that were going on outside of that process, but it was the testosterone coming back into my system that really made me paranoid and quite aggressive and I just couldn\u2019t cope. The main part of it was that I couldn\u2019t get what I needed.\u201d\nSome names have been changed",

        "content": "When the 2004 tsunami struck, the Moken were saved by their knowledge of the sea. But a catastrophic blaze has exposed authorities\u2019 errors in the rebuilding of their homes\nWhere stilted huts once stood on the white sand, now there are just charred remains. \u201cThis is worse than after the tsunami,\u201d says Hook, a Moken sea nomad surveying the damage fire has wreaked on his former village home in Au Bon Yai bay, Surin island.\nAfter the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami destroyed the previous Moken settlement here on Thailand\u2019s Andaman sea, Hook says people were able to recover some belongings. This time, when fire broke out on 3 February this year, nothing was left. Now the community fears for the future as the authorities begin to reconstruct the village in its original design, an unsafe housing model consisting of highly flammable structures, densely packed together. And it has reignited a row about the Moken\u2019s rights to their ancestral lands.\nThe Moken, skilful freedivers, hunters and sea nomads, had always lived at sea, moving on to land only during the rainy season \u2013 until they were pushed ashore permanently some decades ago. The Surin community of Moken made their home on the islands many generations ago. The Moken came to the world\u2019s attention for their survival and heroism during the 2004 tsunami and now the village, located in a national park, attracts thousands of tourists.\nIt was just after sunset on that Sunday earlier this month, the last of the tour groups had left. It had been hot for days and the huts, made from bamboo and palm leaves, were completely dried out. A strong north wind blew, as it does at this time of year. The fire, accidentally sparked in one family\u2019s hut, engulfed the structure quickly. The layout of the village \u2013 three rows of huts packed so closely together their roofs were almost touching \u2013 enabled the flames to spread with frightening speed, like a fire spirit dancing from roof to roof, the villagers said. The homes went up like tinder. The Moken fought hard, until it became too hot to continue. It took just 30 minutes for all 61 houses on the right side of the bay to be swallowed by flames.\nThe timing of the fire was fortunate. Tourists had gone, and everyone was active \u2013 women washing, preparing dinner, children playing in the sand or with homemade boats in the water.\nWhile there was no loss of life, 273 people were left homeless, their belongings gone \u2013 everything from cooking pots to clothes, work materials and tools, life savings and generations-old family heirlooms. As the fire spread towards the edge of the village, Tad helped his wife Sabai, particularly vulnerable in her blindness, escape the flames, grabbing his drum and her betel nuts as they ran. All the Moken women and children were evacuated to a campsite on a neighbouring island within Surin\u2019s national park, but the following day, they returned to the village, preferring to sleep under the stars than canvas.\nThe park authorities and the Thai navy were on the scene fast. Government officials had provisions delivered from the mainland and committed financial assistance. Donations and aid arrived in the form of food, medical supplies, clothes.\nDaily life is challenging. There is one water hose for the whole village. A few coal stoves are distributed for cooking. But the Moken are well practised in sharing \u2013 their language has no word for \u201cwant\u201d, \u201ctake\u201d, \u201cmine\u201d. People sleep on the beach, in the school, and share the 15 huts that the villagers saved, thanks to a space separating them from the main cluster.\nThe government has sent soldiers from Surathani to help reconstruct the village, before the rainy season comes at the end of March. Their time \u2013 and funding \u2013 is limited, and, in the rush to rebuild, all signs point to a quick reconstruction of the original confined layout \u2013 the same rows of small huts packed into the same tight space, built with the same flammable materials.\nBut the Moken have now seen exactly how dangerous this layout is. \u201cWe have large tour groups here in the dry season,\u201d says Hook. \u201cWith the villagers and so many tourists in our small bay, we worry about this happening again, about people being injured or worse.\u201d\nRegardless, the soldiers have been digging holes, laying foundations and poles for 61 plots within the same perimeters. The size allocated for each home is impossibly small \u2013 just 3m by 6.5m. \u201cMy family houses six people,\u201d despairs Mi Nge. \u201cThere will be just 3m by 4m inside space for my family to sleep, store our belongings, and a kitchen.\u201d There has been consultation between provincial government, the national park and navy, but not, it appears, with the Moken. \u201cWe Moken men are well experienced in building our own houses,\u201d points out Hook. \u201cWhy is no one asking us, how and where we want to set up our own houses?\u201d\nNgui, Hook\u2019s elder brother, is the head of the village. While he appreciates government assistance, he shares concern that the planned housing is unsuitable and unsafe. \u201cThey said they would show us the plan to see if it fits our needs,\u201d he says. \u201cNo has come around to ask us, yet they already started placing the poles of the houses.\u201d He is worried about future fire risks, and how his growing community will fit into this increasingly uninhabitable space.\nThe Moken know better than anyone how to organise and structure their village, safely and sustainably, in harmony with the environment. \u201cIt would be great to rebuild the wood houses with thatch roofs, but more spread out and durably constructed,\u201d says Ngui. Ngui wants more space, and there is room to extend along the bay. But so far, the national park authorities refuse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that we would expand any development beyond the current beach,\u201d said Putthapoj Khuphrasit, the head of Koh Surin national park, as he surveyed the bay on 8 February. \u201cWe have to balance the needs of the community with the management of the protected environment inside of the park.\u201d\nThere is another option the park won\u2019t yet discuss \u2013 the use of a bay nearby. For generations, Moken lived between several bays on Koh Surin, including Au Bon Yai bay and Sai En bay (where they buried their ancestors) long before the park existed; these lands are, by rights, their ancestral home. The obvious solution would be to return both bays to the Moken to live in and manage. As General Surin Pikulthong, a member of the Committee for the Affairs of Indigenous Peoples, puts it: \u201cThey have been here longer than any of us \u2026 there is no law that gives the government power to dictate the lives of ethnic groups who predated the government that are living on their ancestral lands.\u201d\nThe Moken have been here before. They are a resilient and resourceful people. When the 2004 tsunami struck, they survived thanks to intimate knowledge of the sea, passed down through generations. As people around the world stared in wonder at the receding water that came before that devastating wave, Moken elders read the danger and quickly evacuated everyone \u2013 their own people, and tourists \u2013 to higher ground. Then they rescued survivors at sea. More than 230,000 people were lost in the tsunami worldwide; the Moken, who were directly in the path of the wave, lost no one. The real trauma came in the reconstruction of their homes. The national park authorities\u2019 demands rode roughshod over Moken cultural traditions.\nNormally, the animist Moken erect their huts at the edge of the beach, stilted feet in the water, living in the space between land and sea, like their mythical kin, the turtle. When they were pushed to the smaller bay, the park insisted on the current formation of small huts in regimented lines, tightly packed together (lacking important social spaces), facing each other (considered an ill omen) set back from the sea, and near the jungle (where spirits are believed to reside).\nAs well as cultural traditions, there was a pragmatism to the Moken\u2019s living arrangements, their huts spaced safely apart at the waters\u2019 edge, the lapping waves washing away small amounts of natural waste generated from each household. The layout insisted upon by the park not only disregarded important cultural traditions, it created problems with hygiene, contributed to the spread of disease. And of course, it was a huge fire hazard.\nTalking to reporters on his recent visit to the decimated village, Putthapoj Khuphrasit dismissed concerns about safety, pointing \u2013 somewhat irrelevantly \u2013 to the fact that the park employs Moken people. \u201cWe provide them with breakfast and lunch,\u201d he offered, adding: \u201cThe village elders are able to stay at home and make souvenirs to sell to tourists. They have what they need.\u201d\nNarumon Arunothai, an anthropologist from Chulalongkorn University who has worked with the Moken for decades, disagrees. \u201cIn the minds of the community this space could be used to greatly reduce the congested current layout, and ensure sufficient fire break areas to prevent further accidents.\u201d She wants government agencies to work with the Moken. \u201cThis crisis presents an opportunity for the community to bring themselves together and develop the best way to live in a conservation area.\u201d\nThe Surin Moken know and love their land better than anyone. They are highly motivated to look after it.\n\u201cI was born here, my mother and father died here,\u201d says Misia, an elder and the Moken\u2019s spiritual leader. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my children, my grandchildren, my nephews and nieces. I worry that we won\u2019t be happy. We\u2019ve had many people try to convince us to live on the mainland. I\u2019ve been to the places some have asked us to resettle, but they are not on the open sea. Eventually we made our way back here to where we\u2019ve always been.\u201d\n Susan Smillie is the author of The Last Sea Nomads: Inside the disappearing world of the Moken, published by Guardian Shorts",

        "content": "Joyous blooms mix with climate fears as you tell the story of the UK\u2019s surprise burst of warmth\nUK experiences winter temperatures of 20C for first time\nRecord temperatures in complete contrast to the weather at this time last year have led to signs that spring has sprung much earlier than usual in the UK, and naturalists have expressed worry about what this means for the environment.\nWe asked you to share the signs where you are, and received thoughtful contributions and photographs from around the UK. After a warm weekend for much of Britain, Anna Markwell, in East Sussex, said: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, but worryingly mild.\u201d Her sentiment was echoed in many of your stories; the flutter of butterflies and buzzing of bees is something to be savoured \u2013 but could their early appearance lead to environmental disaster? And could the need for an early antihistamine dose be the least of our problems in the coming years?\nBelow are some of your stories and photographs.\nPatrick Green was one of many readers to share concern in his contribution (which included the image at the top of this piece, taken in north London\u2019s Clissold Park).\n\u201cThe scenes are very beautiful, and I\u2019m very pleased with the pictures I took on 22 February, but I know I\u2019m seeing them too early: climate change terrifies me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPoliticians are in a permanent state of denial and seem oblivious to what is staring them in the face. The weather on our shared planet is changing in dangerous and unpredictable ways and the future of humanity is at stake.\u201d\nPetr Skapa is also worried: \u201cThis wild plum tree grows alongside a public footpath where dog walkers, joggers, families with children and young couples are casually passing without even noticing it.\n\u201cI am perplexed by the apparent public indifference toward weather swings in the last 20 years. If the scientists are correct with their climate modelling, the swings are not only here to stay but are set to increase, causing havoc in living nature; forests, agriculture, everything will change, and not for the better. How this flowery demonstration of a trend toward a future laden with risks to water and food security doesn\u2019t alarm everyone passing by is beyond me.\u201d\nSeveral readers contacted us to say they had been surprised to see butterflies around already. It is unusual to see a red admiral so early, according to Butterfly Conservation, but Anne Davison saw this specimen on 22 February, resting on an Edgeworthia chrysantha bush in her garden near Stamford, Lincolnshire.\nBees were also early visitors to gardens and parks near many of you. \u201cThey are around pollinating crocuses and there are a lot more flowers around in general,\u201d says Julie Prescott, echoing many fellow readers\u2019 surprise and concern for the creatures. \u201cIt\u2019s a big contrast to 21 February last year, which was very snowy here in Blyton, Lincolnshire.\u201d\nGareth Todd Jones, who keeps honey bees in the Rhondda valley, south Wales, remembers nursing them through a cold early 2018 and is struck by the difference this year: \u201cWatching the way they are reacting to February temperatures that are really too high is fascinating. Honey bees are the ultimate evolvers, but I can\u2019t help but be concerned!\u201d\nAndy Bell, in Burton upon Trent, sent this picture of frogspawn in his pond. Pools in Mark Palmer\u2019s allotment in Ulverston, Cumbria, have also filled with spawn over the last week. \u201cIt is earlier by around two weeks than normal, perhaps because we have not yet had any really heavy frosts \u2013 being on the northern side of Morecambe Bay probably helps with sheltered weather.\u201d\nVeronica Love, in Dumfries and Galloway, shared a similar story. \u201cSoft croaks on Sunday morning led me to the side of our garden pond where I watched two frogs mating \u2013 and a third trying and failing to muscle in. I expect frogspawn to appear soon, but it doesn\u2019t stay long as the goldfish feast on it.\u201d\nReports that the air is unusually perfumed this spring due to warm weather in 2018 are perhaps confirmed by Helen Garland, in Bristol. \u201cThese iris were inherited from my mother and my grandmother, and normally flower in April. They are a really old variety that have a scent, so it\u2019s strange to see them already.\u201d\nHelen Evans, a reader in Ruthin, north Wales, notes down the first time she sees certain flowers each year. \u201cI made a point of looking for violets on my walk on 23 February and did see a few growing next to a country lane. In 2016 the first violet was 12 March, 11 March in 2017 and 24 March last year.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly warm,\u201d says Courtney Hopf, in east London, another reader to note record snowfalls this time in 2018. \u201cI know [parakeets] are essentially invasive pests, but seeing that flash of tropical green in London always gives me a little thrill. This parakeet and three others were busily nibbling this tree\u2019s blossoms for hours last Friday.\u201d\nForagers among you have been enjoying early crops. John Kelly said he\u2019d collected \u201cboatloads of mature wild garlic\u201d in Leeds over the last few days. Elizabeth, in Cardiff, said she\u2019d been harvesting garlic for around three weeks, much earlier than usual.\nTell us about the early signs of spring where you are \u2013 and how you feel about it \u2013 in the comments. You can also share photographs and stories in our callout.",

        "content": "Editor Mallory Farrugia\u2019s energising collection traces the living thread from Mary Wollstonecraft to Mindy Kaling\nIn a way, The Future Is Feminist is aptly named, as it\u2019s a Tardis of a book. Edited by Mallory Farrugia, the anthology zips back and forth between different time zones to offer \u201cradical, funny and inspiring writing by women\u201d as far back as the 18th century (an extract from Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s groundbreaking 1792 book, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman), through to modern articles, such as Naomi Alderman\u2019s ambitious How to Build a Truly Feminist Society (the Guardian, 2017). All 21 pieces have previously appeared elsewhere, as everything from poems and essays to book excerpts, even speeches. While Jessica Valenti notes in her foreword that recent times have seen \u201can explosion in the cultural power and relevance of feminism\u201d, this anthology also serves as a reminder that the wick on the feminist dynamite has long fizzed dangerously.\nIt fires up with Rachel Fudge\u2019s 2005 essay Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Feminism But Were Afraid to Ask. Fudge runs through the different kinds of feminist terms \u2013 ultimately concluding that ongoing relevance matters more than labels: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t something that happened to your mother or grandmother and now it\u2019s over. It\u2019s living, breathing, evolving.\u201d\nFrom there, the book takes us on a tour of eclectic meditations: Jia Tolentino on perceptions of beauty (\u201cBeauty in the 21st century can be boiled down to a combination of technology and time\u201d); Sofi Jawed-Wessel on sex and pregnancy (\u201cEvery time a woman simply has sex because it feels good, it is revolutionary. She is revolutionary\u201d); Audre Lorde on how a cancer scare helped her find her voice (Death, she writes, is the \u201cfinal silence\u201d). Arlie Russell Hochschild on Gender, Status and Feeling (\u201cThe emotional arts\u201d). Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie on how Feminism Should Not Be An Exclusive Party. Claire Vaye Watkins rebelling against the perception of the male literary voice as more valuable: \u201cI don\u2019t want to write like a man any more. I don\u2019t want to be praised for being \u2018unflinching\u2019. I want to flinch. I want to be wide open.\u201d\nElsewhere, there are flashes of social history, big and small, from Judy Brady\u2019s laconic 1971 essay, I Want a Wife, to Jessica Bennett\u2019s wry 2015 look at the resting bitch face phenomenon. Caitlin Moran tells male Esquire readers how it is (\u201cPlease remember that the patriarchy is bumming you as hard as it\u2019s bumming us\u201d). Roxane Gay uses the prism of cinema to muse on the great female crime of appearing \u201cunlikable\u201d, while Mindy Kaling lampoons onscreen female stereotypes. Also featured is Salma Hayek\u2019s harrowing 2017 New York Times essay, Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too \u2013 detailing the relentless sexual intimidation she suffered at Weinstein\u2019s hands while trying to make the film Frida. As Hayek observes: \u201cMen sexually harassed because they could.\u201d\nWhile the #MeToo era is represented, so too is the distant feminist past. In Sojourner Truth\u2019s Ain\u2019t I a Woman? (1851), the former slave turned activist robustly mocks the concept of innate feminine fragility: \u201cI could work as much and eat as much as a man \u2013 when I could get it \u2013 and bear the lash as well! And ain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d Wollstonecraft trains her focus on how women are venerated for the very qualities (beauty, coquettishness) that turn into societal traps: \u201cI lament that women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions, which men think it manly to pay to the sex, when, in fact, they are insultingly supporting their own superiority.\u201d Go, Mary!\nThis is one of the key strengths of The Future Is Feminist \u2013 a full commitment to diversity, not just in terms of races and generations, but also topics, styles and approaches, resulting in a varied, energising read. At the same time, all the pieces seem connected in spirit \u2013 signifying a thread between the generations that may, at times, have become frayed, but is ultimately unbreakable. Considering the bold title, it should be noted that this collection makes precisely zilch attempt to prove that the future is destined to be any more feminist than the past or present. However, it does showcase the feminist voice as a continuum \u2013 surviving and thriving in the most unexpected and challenging of circumstances. Maybe that\u2019s even better.\n The Future Is Feminist is published by Chronicle (\u00a317.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

        "content": "Some headteachers have privately supported pupils\u2019 climate-change walkout. But not all agree\nThousands of pupils walked out of their classrooms on the Friday before half-term to protest against the lack of action on climate change. Though many headteachers privately support the strike, the issue has divided the school community. In a letter to the Guardian, more than 200 academics backed the students\u2019 stand, but the two headteacher unions said it was disruptive for schools and raised safeguarding issues. So should pupils have time off to protest?\nprofessor of education, Cambridge University\n\u201cYes, definitely. I\u2019d like to think that had I still been teaching in a school, I would have taken a stand and gone on strike in support. The older generation has really let young people down with short-termism and by prioritising self-interest, and I think young people in the UK lack opportunities for democratic engagement.\n\u201cMost of those involved in the strike are too young to have a vote. Protesting is one of the very few ways in which they can take political action and be part of a participatory democracy. I encouraged my niece to go and she came back full of enthusiasm, and also much better informed about the state of the environment. Some people have argued that children are missing out on learning. Well, I think it\u2019s a positive learning experience to come together collectively in a common cause.\u201d\nexecutive headteacher, Harrogate grammar school, and president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL)\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t agree with pupils taking strike action as a protest against climate change. The cause is vital to humanity and I feel personal shame that my generation has allowed this crisis to happen on our watch. But a pupil strike is not the right approach. Each day\u2019s learning is important for their life chances and their potential to go out and change the world. Schools are also in loco parentis and it is a concern if pupils are off site.\n\u201cWe had a small number of very able and principled students let us know they planned to take strike action. Colleagues met them and explained why this was difficult for the school to support as we would struggle with our duty to keep them safe. The head and deputy voiced their support for the cause and showed them what the school was doing to respond to the challenge of climate change. We are not aware of any students who were absent because of strike action.\u201d\u200b\nA-level student, Brighton, Hove and Sussex sixth-form college\n\u201cYes, we should be allowed time off. I think if you care passionately about something enough that it makes you want to go on strike, you should be able to.\n\u201cI say that as someone who values my education, especially right now, with my A-level exams coming up. Missing a day of sixth form meant a lot to me \u2013 it was very costly for me to go when I am right in the middle of revising for my mocks \u2013 but I think it was important the strike took place during the school term. If it had not, it would not have been so impactful or controversial.\n\u201cI have heard people arguing that young people went on strike to get out of school. Those people are not taking us seriously, they are not taking the issue of climate change seriously, and that attitude is part of the reason why we went on strike. When I read the statistics about global warming and what is going to happen in the future, I don\u2019t think enough is being done by older people. If I can do something to make a difference, even if it\u2019s just making everyone around me aware that I\u2019m concerned, then I\u2019m going to jump at that. If older people don\u2019t want us to strike, they need to act.\n\u201cMy parents signed me out of college along with my younger brother, who is in secondary school, so they took responsibility for \u2018safeguarding\u2019 us that day. I know other young people whose parents didn\u2019t want them going, and schools that didn\u2019t allow it. And those young people felt silenced.\u201d\nhead, Heathfield community college, East Sussex\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say yes, but I\u2019m struggling. A school cannot authorise absence for this purpose. A parent can withdraw their child, but must be willing to accept the consequence of a fine. Headteachers rightly have safeguarding concerns for those who miss school yet whose whereabouts are unknown in uncoordinated events such as Friday\u2019s marches.\n\u201cHowever, I believe peaceful, powerful protest has a valuable place in a civilised, democratic society; much good has historically come from it. Teenagers must be able to form, express and share their views. Adults need to listen to young people. They are voters of the future and dismissing or patronising their actions and views now may be something politicians later regret.\u201d\nhead, Sibford school, Banbury, Oxfordshire\n\u201cYes. The school community felt very strongly about the strike and I was happy to authorise the absences of those who wanted to take part. I sense a great deal of exasperation from children that political leaders of the world today seem to be unable or unwilling to take decisive and unilateral action on climate change. Instant gratification and myopic political point-scoring blindly trumps all.\n\u201cAs the head of a Quaker school that takes its responsibility towards the environment seriously, I believe it is incumbent upon us to support the children of today in making their voices heard. What is education about? If we do not have a planet to live on, then there is not a lot of point in learning about Pythagoras or Shakespeare.\n\u201cWhatever the debate about climate change, there is clear and troubling scientific evidence, which cannot be ignored. Many children rightly have a sense of urgency and they absolutely should have a voice.\u201d",

        "content": "Some schools keep only three extra places for disadvantaged children, despite promises of social mobility\nIt\u2019s a busy time for Satish Pakki, a telecoms solutions architect, and his daughter, Vanshika, as they prepare for her 11-plus test in September.\nPreparations entail weekly tuition in maths and English, and monthly mock tests at a local tuition centre. Vanshika is applying to Kendrick school in Berkshire \u2013 one of 16 grammars given funds to expand under a flagship government policy aimed at improving social mobility.\nAs a result, Kendrick, a girls\u2019 school, is prioritising pupils from postcodes where it says levels of disadvantage are higher \u2013 and they don\u2019t include Lower Earley in Reading, where the family live.\nPakki is not convinced his daughter is competing on a level playing field. \u201cWhen they talk about poverty, I know there are some areas in Reading which are poorer, but if you go to the areas that are prioritised they already have a good school, and none of the houses there are below \u00a3500,000,\u201d he says.\nThe housing website Zoopla suggests the average house price in Lower Earley is \u00a3377,000, while in nearby Earley, which is being prioritised, it is \u00a3592,000.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should have preference, but they should treat everyone equally,\u201d Pakki says. \u201cIf my daughter doesn\u2019t get in to Kendrick because children from more disadvantaged homes are being prioritised, then that\u2019s fine. But I don\u2019t think they are.\u201d\nThe figures support his fears that schools will still fail to reach out to children from disadvantaged homes. Theresa May promised in September 2016 that the extra money to expand grammar schools and improve social mobility would help create \u201ca truly meritocratic Britain\u201d. Grammars would have to \u201ccontribute meaningfully\u201d, she said. \u201cThis could mean taking a proportion of pupils from lower-income households, so that selective education is not reserved for those with the means to move into a catchment area or pay for tuition to pass the test.\u201d\nThe government has provided an extra \u00a350m a year for the expansion, creating about 30 extra places in each year group in each of the first 16 schools to receive the funding \u2013 a total of 2,700 extra places.\nHowever, according to the data scientist James Coombs, from Comprehensive Future, a campaigning group for fair school admissions, at some schools only two or three of the 30 new places will go to pupil premium students \u2013 those looked after by local authorities or from poor homes. His analysis is based on a summary of schools\u2019 plans to ensure new places go to pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, recently published by the government.\nCoombs concludes that none of the schools have reserved a proportion of places for pupils from poorer backgrounds, though some have said that if these pupils pass the entrance test, they will be admitted ahead of their better-off peers, and some have lowered the pass mark for poorer pupils. Just one, Altrincham grammar school for boys, has a target \u2013 its aim is for 15% of its year 7 students to be entitled to pupil premium by 2023.\nUsing free school meals\u2019 data alongside test scores provided by the University of Durham, which sets the 11-plus tests, Coombs calculates that at Kendrick \u2013 his local school \u2013 just three out of 32 additional places are likely to go to girls eligible for free school meals. That\u2019s despite the fact Kendrick has lowered its pass mark by five points for poorer pupils.\nTwo other expanding grammars, Sir William Borlase\u2019s and John Hampden in Buckinghamshire, have respectively prioritised \u201cup to\u201d 10 and 12 places for disadvantaged children. Coombs calculates only two or three will go to such pupils.\nHe says that instead of manipulating the pass mark by lowering it to \u201ccatch\u201d poorer students, schools should have followed May\u2019s original suggestion and simply earmarked a set number of places for such pupils.\n\u201cDamian Hinds has repeatedly promised schools must have \u2018realistic and ambitious plans\u2019 to admit more disadvantaged children. He seems to assume these targets can be achieved with a sprinkling of fairy dust,\u201d Coombs says.\nKendrick school and Sir William Borlase\u2019s grammar school did not respond to requests for comment. But the head of John Hampden grammar school, Tracey Hartley, said in a written statement that the response to its public consultation had been overwhelmingly positive.\n\u201cWe have lowered the qualifying mark for these 12 places to encourage applications from pupil premium and service premium students and this step has been very favourably received by our partner primary schools as it will be by many parents in our catchment area,\u201d she said. \u201cThe awarding of the funding will benefit the young people in our community for years to come.\u201d\nConcern over the lack of social diversity in selective schools is heightened by new figures obtained by Lucy Powell, the Labour MP and former shadow education secretary, on the proportion of pupils on free school meals at the 16 expanding grammar schools. While the national average proportion of secondary pupils on free meals stood at 13.8%, the average in those selective schools stood at well below 3%. The lowest was at Sir William Borlase\u2019s, which had just 0.45% of pupils \u2013 three \u2013 on free meals in January 2017.\nPowell said none of the schools should be allowed to expand until they had improved those figures. \u201cGrammar schools do nothing for social mobility, they do the opposite \u2013 they entrench it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t see how the government can justify allowing schools to expand when they have such poor records in reflecting their communities.\u201d\nJim Skinner, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said campaigners complaining there were too few poorer pupils in grammar schools were missing the point. He said official figures showed that while 12% of pupils who were not disadvantaged achieved a high level of attainment in reading, writing and maths, just 4% of those from disadvantaged backgrounds did so.\n\u201cWe are fully supportive of the long-term goal of getting as many disadvantaged children in grammar schools as there are in the areas where those schools are. The work grammar schools are doing will help to close that national gap, but you can\u2019t overnight have the same percentage of disadvantaged children in grammar schools as you have nationally,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said this was the first time grammar school expansion had been linked to a requirement to widen access. \u201cWe want schools to go further so that families who may not have previously thought about applying to a selective school consider it as an option. We have already seen innovative ideas from successful schools that are taking action such as setting up help desks in partner primary schools to assist parents registering children for the test, or holding information sessions in community libraries,\u201d he said.",

The Liberal party, as well as the Conservatives and the People\u2019s party, all ran candidates in the Burnaby South electoral district. The Green party chose not to run a candidate.\nThe closely watched byelection was not without controversy. In January, Liberal candidate Karen Wang was forced to step aside after making racially charged remarks about Singh.\n\u201cIf we can increase the voting rate, as the only Chinese candidate in this riding, if I can garner 16,000 votes I will easily win the by-election, control the election race and make history!\u201d she wrote on WeChat. \u201cMy opponent in this by-election is the NDP candidate Singh of Indian descent!\u201d\nThe text was widely condemned by both the NDP and the Liberals. Wang stepped down at the request of Trudeau.\nWhile the win is a relief for Singh, the electoral district of Burnaby South is widely viewed as an NDP stronghold.\nIn two other byelections across the country, the NDP lost Outremont, handing over the Quebec seat once held by its former leader to the Liberal party candidate, Rachel Bendayan.\nIn the Ontario seat of York-Simcoe, won by Conservative Scot Davidson, independent candidate John \u201cThe Engineer\u201d Turmel, who holds the world record for the most contested elections, kept his streak going, notching his 96th loss \u2013with less than 1% of the vote.",

While due process continues, our justice system has affirmed no Australian is above the law.\u201d\nThe federal families minister, Paul Fletcher, earlier said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the conviction and applauded the \u201cgenuine courage\u201d of Pell\u2019s victims in coming forward.\nFletcher oversees the redress scheme for survivors of child sexual abuse that was established in response to a recommendation by Australia\u2019s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\n\u201cThe news that someone of George Pell\u2019s seniority within the Catholic church has been convicted of these crimes is deeply disturbing,\u201d the minister said. \u201cMy first thoughts, however, are with the survivors who showed genuine courage to come forward.\u201d\nThe Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on the specific case [because] it\u2019s under appeal \u2026 I feel for anyone who\u2019s ever been a victim of clerical assault and abuse \u2026 this must bring back a lot of very difficult memories \u2013 this is a very difficult time.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\n\u201cIt is very clear that a lot of institutional sexual abuse was swept under the carpet and too often priests, rather than being punished, were moved between parishes \u2026\n\u201cMy thoughts are with the victims of clerical sexual abuse. It should never have happened; it\u2019s a gross betrayal of trust.\u201d\nThe Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and the crossbench senator Derryn Hinch have called for Pell to be stripped of his standing as a companion of the Order of Australia, which is what happened to Rolf Harris after his child abuse conviction in 2015.\nHinch called Pell a \u201cbloody hypocrite\u201d. Hanson-Young said on Twitter that organisations that covered up child sexual abuse \u201cshould have no right to tax-free status or public money\u201d.\nPell\u2019s old school, St Patrick\u2019s College in Ballarat, announced it would strip his name from a building at the school, strike it off the honour board, and revoke his status as an \u201cinducted legend of the school\u201d.\nRichmond football club has removed him as a club vice-patron.\nThe Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen told reporters in Townsville it would be a \u201cdifficult day for victims of sexual abuse\u201d.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m sure victims of sexual abuse will want to see the justice system working without fear or favour,\u201d he said. \u201cAny Australian, no matter how famous or prominent, is subject to law and that is what we\u2019re seeing played out today.\u201d\nThe Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, a practising Catholic, said sexual abuse victims had been \u201cbetrayed, and so have good people of faith across Victoria\u201d.\n\u201cMy thoughts are with the victims \u2013 their pain is a tragedy, their bravery an inspiration,\u201d he said.\nThe former prime minister Tony Abbott, a longstanding friend of Pell who defended the cardinal as a \u201cfine man\u201d in 2017 after he was charged with child sexual offences, including those for which he was later convicted, has yet to comment on the verdict.\nHe previously described Pell as \u201cone of the greatest church officials that Australia has ever seen\u201d.\nRupert Murdoch appeared to share that opinion in 2014, when he tweeted that Australia would miss the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Pell when he went to the Vatican.\nPope Francis appoints brilliant Cardinal Pell from Sydney to be  no.3 power in Vatican.  Australia will miss him but world will benefit.\nAnother staunch defender, the News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt, said Pell had been \u201cfalsely convicted\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my opinion, based on the overwhelming evidence,\u201d Bolt wrote in the Herald Sun. \u201cAnd my opinion is also based in part on how many times Pell has been accused of crimes and sins he clearly did not do.\u201d\nBolt previously called the prosecution a \u201cwitchhunt\u201d and did not attend the trial.\nHe said he had \u201cmet Pell perhaps five times in my life and like him\u201d and that he was \u201cnot just incapable of such abuse, but so intelligent and cautious that he would never risk his brilliant career and good name on such a mad assault in such a public place\u201d.\nThe Jesuit priest and chief executive of Catholic Social Services Australia, Frank Brennan, also cast doubt on the verdict, writing in Eureka Street that he was \u201cvery surprised by the verdict. In fact, I was devastated.\u201d\n\u201cMy only conclusion is that the jury must have disregarded many of the criticisms so tellingly made by [Pell\u2019s lawyer Robert Richter QC] of the complainant\u2019s evidence,\u201d he said.\nHe suggested that public comments about this and other sexual abuse cases might have shifted the narrative.\nHe referred to Morrison\u2019s national apology to survivors and victims of child sexual abuse in which the prime minister said those who \u201cabused the shield of faith and religion to hide their crimes \u2026 stand condemned\u201d.",

        "content": "Olivia Colman, Rami Malek and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n have just taken top honours at this year\u2019s Academy awards but the next ceremony is a mere 12 months away\nWhile there\u2019s widespread relief from many to be saying goodbye to yet another extended awards season, for others, it means something else: the start of the next. Festival slots are being negotiated, release dates are being discussed, campaigns are being plotted and, so inevitably, staggeringly, perhaps stupidly, early predictions are being made.\nSo take these 10 potential contenders with a pinch of salt unless of course they turn out to be entirely accurate then instead, look back on them, and the Guardian at large, in stunned awe.\nIt has been 18 years since Hanks received his last Oscar nomination, after a decade of almost non-stop adoration from the Academy and before a string of perceived snubs for his work in Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Next year sees him campaigning for a comeback as children\u2019s television staple Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a drama that acts as a narrative sibling to last year\u2019s surprise hit documentary Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? While the sugary combination of actor and character might already be giving you toothache, the film\u2019s director Marielle Heller, who brought complex and often cruel characters to the screen in Diary of a Teenage Girl and Can You Ever Forgive Me?, suggests something far spikier.\nIt speaks to Tarantino\u2019s standing with the Academy that The Hateful Eight was seen as a blip, despite winning one Oscar and being nominated for two others. Before the snowy Agatha Christie-esque exercise in self-indulgence, he\u2019d had a brief streak with Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained nabbing 13 nominations between them, and it\u2019s a safe bet his next film will see him back in the main races once again. As well as a soft spot for Tarantino, the Academy has an even softer one for films about films and his 60s-set Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reads like Academy catnip. As well as the LA setting, there\u2019s a stacked cast (including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino) and a storyline that brings in everyone from Steve McQueen to Sharon Tate.\nEver since she was named best actress for Black Swan, Portman has taken the unconventional route of mostly avoiding obvious Oscar-bait roles. She\u2019s cropped up in the Thor franchise, slummed it in comedies like No Strings Attached and Your Highness, stared into space for Terrence Malick in Knight of Cups and Song to Song and hunted indefinable aggressors in Annihilation. Her one nomination since, for playing Jackie Kennedy, was in a strange, complicated and provocative drama that defied stuffy biopic formula, and last year she was put forward for Vox Lux, a similarly curious and unusual film. Her next project sounds like a surer thing for awards attention, playing a woman whose affair with a fellow astronaut sends her on a downward spiral. Although with Fargo and Legion\u2019s Noah Hawley in the director\u2019s chair, expect the unexpected.\nAfter his powerful performance in Get Out snagged him a best actor nomination (and, in my mind, should have led to him taking home the Oscar), Daniel Kaluuya followed it with a banner year as one of the SAG-winning Black Panther ensemble and arguably the MVP of Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows, his menacing turn deserving of even more awards attention. In 2020, he could have a strong chance with Queen & Slim, the directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas, acclaimed director of many a music video as well as episodes of Insecure and Master of None. The prescient tale, written by Lena Waithe, sees a black couple\u2019s first date go wrong when they shoot a cop in self-defence before going on the run.\nGary Oldman\u2019s post-Oscar career has provided him with hours even darker than the one that got him there with critically loathed sci-fi thriller Tau and bland Gerard Butler actioner Hunter Killer to his name. In-between some of the schlockier films he has on the horizon, including haunted boat horror Mary and crime thriller Killers Anonymous, Oldman will play lawyer J\u00fcrgen Mossack in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s hotly anticipated Panama Papers drama The Laundromat. He\u2019s one of many cast members who could see himself in the race with Meryl Streep, David Schwimmer, Jeffrey Wright, Matthias Schoenaerts all starring alongside.\nOne of the few performances here that some critics, including myself, have already seen is Annette Bening\u2019s rich, detailed take on senator Dianne Feinstein in The Report, a compelling, angry retelling of the investigation into post 9/11 torture practices. It\u2019s commanding work that avoids mere mimicry and Bening exists on that surprising list of great actors who have never won an Oscar, despite four nominations, and given how the Academy has been turning bridesmaids into brides in recent years, from Leo to Glenn, a best supporting actress win could make sense. The film\u2019s talky, unemotional directness might turn some voters off but, aside from Scott Z Burns\u2019 info-packed script, she has the best chance of recognition.\nMaking small but impactful impressions last year in both Widows and Bad Times at El Royale, the Tony-winning actor and singer Cynthia Erivo is about to enjoy a much bigger year. She\u2019ll crop up in Doug Liman\u2019s big-budget YA adaptation Chaos Walking, 12 Years a Slave writer John Ridley\u2019s sci-fi adventure Needle in a Timestack and, most prominently, as abolitionist and activist Harriet Tubman in an awards-aiming biopic. Film-makers have tried to bring Tubman\u2019s story to the screen before, with a Viola Davis-starring project once mooted, but final responsibility was given to Kasi Lemmons, who impressed with her 1997 debut Eve\u2019s Bayou and next year, could become the first woman of colour to nab a nomination for best director.\nIf you were one of the precious few who saw James Gray\u2019s last film, the wonderful yet sorely underseen adventure The Lost City Of Z, you\u2019ll also be aware of how sorely under-nominated it was as well. The director started out in smaller, grittier crime fare but his bleak period drama The Immigrant, also sorely underseen, kicked off a new, more ambitious phase in his career. He\u2019s expanding his scope even further with Ad Astra, a pet project that\u2019s set to be one of 2019\u2019s most fascinating films, starring Brad Pitt as an engineer traveling through the solar system to find his lost father, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Gray has compared the story to Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness while also claiming it will be \u201cthe most realistic depiction of space travel that\u2019s been put in a movie\u201d.

In the Untitled Roger Ailes Project, working title Fair and Balanced, she\u2019s taking on Megyn Kelly as she helped take on the misogynistic culture at Fox News. But just in case you might worry that Kelly will be branded as some sort of hero, given her heinous history of racism, reports suggest that The Big Short writer Charles Randolph has crafted her as \u201cambitious, hard-working and not highly intelligent\u201d. The stacked cast, also including Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon and Allison Janney, suggests multiple nominations could be in store.\nOne of the many great things about Donald Glover\u2019s dazzling awards magnet Atlanta is the rise of Zazie Beetz, an actor whose charming yet underused presence makes one crave so much more. She has since cropped up in Deadpool 2, High Flying Bird and, ermmm, Geostorm and this year, she will be in pretty much everything. While roles in schlocky horror Wounds and the Joaquin Phoenix-starring Joker movie are unlikely to inspire Academy acclaim, Beetz will also appear in two juicy Oscar prospects. The first is Lucy in the Sky, the aforementioned drama that stars Natalie Portman as a troubled astronaut, and the second is Against All Enemies, where she will play activist Dorothy Jamal in a fact-based thriller also starring Kristen Stewart.",

Which way is up?\u201d\u2019 \nI was in a play on Broadway that got such bad reviews it opened and closed on the same night. I had been cast opposite an actor called Gerry Ragni and told him about my dream of writing a musical. It was the mid-60s, a time when hippies were appearing in the East Village. They seemed like creatures from outer space, so open, loving and beautiful. They touched our hearts. The anti-Vietnam-war protests on the streets were dramatic and thrilling. Gerry and I thought we could write a show about all this.\nI\u2019d seen a painting at the Whitney Museum, of a comb holding a clump of hair that had been pulled out. It was just called Hair \u2013 and that gave us the title for our musical. Galt MacDermot, our composer, set everything to music, even the stage directions \u2013 unlike Herbie Hancock, who was asked to write music for one of our songs, and returned it with half the lyrics cut.\nFate seemed to be at work with the show. Gerry was on a train one day when he met the producer Joseph Papp, who had a new venue in New York, the Public Theater, and needed a show to open it. Two weeks later, we had the job.\nThe show needed actors with long hair but there was no such thing at the time, so we would approach suitable people in the street, tap them on the shoulder and say: \u201cExcuse me, do you sing?\u201d The songs we\u2019d written really pushed the envelope and there was a mood of permissiveness among the actors, too. Once the show moved to Broadway, there was more and more drug use backstage. Whenever the fire marshal came round, the stage manager would get on the intercom and say: \u201cMarti Whitehead, please report to the stage manager\u2019s desk.\u201d Then everyone knew to throw their joints away.\nThe Public Theater wouldn\u2019t let us do the nude scene, but our Broadway director Tom O\u2019Horgan was all in favour. In fact, he changed it so that instead of just two people, the entire cast took their clothes off. I played Claude, the leader of the hippies, and Gerry played Berger, a free spirit \u2013 until we got fired from our own show. The play had opened a production in Los Angeles and we went over to visit, watching from the back of the theatre. We decided to take our clothes off during the interval and walk down the aisle naked.\nThe producer heard about it and decided we were a liability. When we flew back to New York, we\u2019d been fired and there were armed guards on the door of the theatre keeping us out. So we wrote on a bedsheet \u201cWe want our baby back!\u201d and picketed the theatre. They let us back on stage eventually.\nAfter that, Gerry and I started fighting more and more. It had become too intense: we had to get away from each other. But we found our way back to each other as friends, even writing a second show called Sun, which has never been produced. Maybe someone will put it on before I die.\nIt was a wonderful, exciting time. Everything was changing. I was working at the Night Owl Cafe in the Village when Jim and Gerry came in looking for musicians. I had long hair and was innocent-looking, and they asked if I could sing, dance or act. I said: \u201cNo. Who are you?\u201d My friend talked me into auditioning so I sang With a Little Help from My Friends. They liked it, but they didn\u2019t have a role for me \u2013 so they wrote a song, Frank Mills, for me instead.\nJim and Gerry were yin and yang: Gerry was outgoing and wacky, Jim quiet and thoughtful. Galt was the grownup in the room. We became like a close-knit family \u2013 a tribe, as we called it. The nude scene didn\u2019t bother us: we weren\u2019t shy about our bodies. We were anti-war, of course, and went on the anti-Vietnam marches and to be-ins at the park. But they said we hated the soldiers, which just wasn\u2019t true.\nOne night Keith Carradine [father of Shelley\u2019s daughter Martha] made some pot brownies and brought them in. A lot of the cast ate some, as well as the sound man and the lighting guy. It was kind of an interesting show after that. We all had to hang on to one another: \u201cWhere is the audience? What am I doing? Which way is up?\u201d\nMartha was born in 1970. When I began to show, they had me play the part of the pregnant girl, Jeanie. That was a lot of fun, but it became too dangerous because she has to go up a ladder. After Martha was born, she\u2019d be backstage with me. Many stage managers have held her while I sang Frank Mills.\nA lot of the show is about masculinity and male friendship. Heather MacRae \u2013 who played Sheila, the woman caught in a love triangle with Claude and Berger \u2013 was magnificent. I remember sharing a dressing room with Diane Keaton and Melba Moore, too. They were getting their careers together while I was just having a good time. I never felt like acting was my calling.\nThe 50th-anniversary production Hair the Musical tours the UK from 21 March.\nThis article was amended on 15 March 2019 because an earlier version referred to Hair\u2019s director as Tim Horgan instead of Tom O\u2019Horgan.",

        "content": "If there\u2019s one group of professionals more indebted to the unhappy family than psychiatrists, it\u2019s novelists. In the case of the Siskins,the clan at the heart of Hannah Beckerman\u2019s resolutely heartbreaking second novel, familial dysfunction has long since ossified into estrangement. Yet in a complex, cruel twist, their acrimony will turn out to flow from the very lifeblood of every happy family\u2019s tale: love.\nJess and Lily are chalk-and-cheese sisters, one an artsy single mum struggling to meet her mortgage repayments, the other a high-powered ceiling-smasher whose life resembles a sleek photo-shoot. Though their west London homes are just three miles apart and their daughters the same age, it\u2019s been 15 years since they last saw one another and nearly three decades since they\u2019ve properly spoken. But now their mother, Audrey, is gravely ill; with just months to live, she is desperate to see her girls reconciled.\nThough romance sparks and infidelity combusts on these pages, this is a very grownup novel, its focus firmly on platonic familial bonds that, as Beckerman shows, can have infinitely more devastating effects than anything Cupid might tie. It\u2019s a very female novel, too, without any of the twee cosiness that description so often connotes. Switching between its trio of distinct viewpoints, the narrative toggles back and forth in time, compelling each woman in turn to re-examine her memories of the moment when things went so wrong for their family, in the summer of 1988.\nMeanwhile, melding her peace-making mission with a bucket list inspired by a diary entry written on her 16th birthday, Audrey takes up life drawing, joins a choir and jets off to New York. That might make If Only I Could Tell You sound breezy \u2013 it\u2019s not. Having set the clock ticking, journalist and critic Beckerman moves the narrative along at a determined pace, tapping pop-culture references for flashback atmosphere (think Rick Astley, Grange Hill and Wagon Wheels) and eschewing overly fussy imagery in favour of clipped precision. Without the padding of extraneous scene-setting, her psychological acuity becomes all the more winding. And somehow, in a plot galvanised by guilt, grief and tragic misunderstandings, quieter observations, such as the pained push-pull dynamic of the parent-teen relationshipor the fathomless depth of feeling that\u2019s conveyed by the touch of a maternal hand , become just as unravelling.\nThis shares much with novels that find themselves stuffed into that faddy, baggy subgenre we\u2019re encouraged to call \u201cup-lit\u2019. Fortunately, its commitment to the unhappy family is such that even as Audrey is visited by bittersweet epiphanies, there\u2019s a rich and lingering melancholy. \u201cThere were as many different beginnings to a life as someone was brave and kind enough to allow themselves,\u201d she finally learns. It\u2019s 11th-hour wisdom and all the truer for it.\n If Only I Could Tell You is published by Orion (14.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

        "content": "Morrison government waved through plan for luxury camp with helicopter access despite expert advice\nA Tasmanian council has blocked a contentious private tourism development with helicopter access in the state\u2019s world heritage wilderness.\nThe luxury camp proposal for remote Halls Island on Lake Malbena, in the Walls of Jerusalem national park, had been waved through by the Morrison government in August against the recommendation of expert advisory bodies.\nThe Liberal state government, which has strongly backed the development, immediately flagged the likelihood of an appeal.\nEnvironmentalists said the decision was a win against the state\u2019s push for more commercial tourism in national parks and the vast Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covers about one-fifth of the island.\nThe proposal by eco-tourism business Wild Drake would involve tourists being flown in and out of a permanent campsite constructed on the island. It would cater for up to six visitors at a time interested in bushwalking, kayaking and learning about the area\u2019s cultural history.\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday, the Central Highlands council rejected the proposal six votes to three. Some councillors were critical of state and federal authorities for leaving the decision on a development in the world heritage area to local officials. Some said they believed it did not fit with Parks and Wildlife Service policies.\nThe Wilderness Society acting campaign manager Tom Allen said it was a victory for people power, pointing to the 1,340 objections lodged against the proposal.\n\u201cLiterally thousands of Tasmanians have stepped up to protect world heritage wilderness from a profiteering government sponsoring exploitative practices,\u201d he said.\nThe premier, Will Hodgman, said the councillors appeared not to have followed the planning scheme and had voted against the advice of their own planners. \u201cThe government understands there are strong grounds to appeal the decision,\u201d he said.\nHodgman, who has declared the state \u201copen for business\u201d for development proposals on public land, said the camp had been subjected to rigorous commonwealth assessment.\nA federal environment department assistant secretary acting on behalf of the environment minister, Melissa Price, in August found the camp was not a threat to matters of national environmental significance and did not need federal approval.\nThree expert bodies advised against the development going ahead as proposed. The National Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council, a state body, expressed concern about opening the world heritage area up to private commercial development with permanent structures and potentially frequent helicopter flights.\nThe Australian Heritage Council found the development would have considerable impact on world heritage values and warned the buildings, helipad and tracks did not conform to zoning rules. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Heritage Council said the proposed camp was near a recently discovered rare heritage site.\nWild Drake owner Daniel Hackett told a council meeting his employees had been bullied during the application process, receiving abusive late-night phone calls and messages on vehicles and social media.\nAllen said he sympathised with Hackett and the Central Highlands councillors. \u201cThey and the wider community are victims of substandard planning laws that don\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\nThe fight over the camp comes against a backdrop of lawyers, academics and environmentalists pushing for the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to be strengthened or replaced. A Guardian Australia investigation last year found campaigners and political veterans believed it was now harder to win federal environmental protection than at any time since the 1980s.\nIn December the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, promised to introduce a new Australian environment act and create a commonwealth environmental protection agency if elected, but is yet to release details.",

We have got every reason to hope that things will progress more smoothly.\u201d\nIn an article in the Daily Mail, writing with Harrington and Perry, James signalled the group\u2019s support for the Cooper/Letwin amendment.\nThey wrote: \u201cIt is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees. We implore the government to take that step this week.\n\u201cBut if the prime minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks\u2019 time that we may regret forever.\u201d\nThere is mounting speculation that up to 15 ministers could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point.\nJames told Today: \u201cFor quite a long time colleagues and I have been very concerned about the way in which this deal, which the prime minister is trying to get through, is continuously be frustrated \u2026 As D-day approaches we felt honour-bound to do something to help prevent such a catastrophe.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cBy making this stand, hopefully that will encourage others to come in and support that deal and get it through. That\u2019s our primary goal.\u201d\n\u201cIf for any reason we can\u2019t persuade enough colleagues to get in behind that deal then it is so near to 29 March that the only option going forward is to extend article 50.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want to see that happen but I think we feel that if the deal doesn\u2019t get through then that has to be the alternative; otherwise this country leaves without a deal which none of us wants and there\u2019s a parliamentary majority against that.\u201d\nAnd in a swipe at the hardline pro-Brexit European Research Group, James added: \u201cFor us to leave with the biggest trade deal we have got in pursuit of other trade deals that might take 10 years to negotiate with far smaller countries is madness.\u201d",

        "content": "With the animal making a comeback in many US cities, enthusiasts such as San Francisco\u2019s \u2018coyote lady\u2019 have become both educator and defender\nSan Francisco\u2019s resident Coyote Lady met her first coyote early one cool June morning on Twin Peaks, one of the city\u2019s tallest hills.\nThe coyote was a curious little thing, prancing here and there, dashing up the hill, and then down, all the while watching this strange creature and her dog. \u201cShe ran this way, she ran that way, she was so excited, like, \u2018What\u2019s going on? What are you doing?\u2019\u201d said Janet Kessler, 69.\nIn other words, it was as if Kessler met herself that day in 2007. Describing her first magical encounter, Kessler jumped up from her table at a local cafe to show how that coyote danced and played. Skittering back and forth, she demonstrated that the coyote was more than just an animal, more than the predator feared by small-dog owners, more than just the vermin that so many in rural areas still consider these creatures to be.\n\u201cShe had a personality,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cShe was interested. She was intelligent. She obviously had emotions. She was reaching beyond her species.\u201d\nFrom that first meeting, Kessler was hooked, becoming part of a growing fascination over coyotes that has swept the United States over the past decade. This fascination \u2013 and the subsequent research borne from it \u2013 has centered in particular on coyotes that inhabit cities, as more and more coyotes appear to be making their homes in urban hubs across North America.\nCoyotes once considered many of these cities their native habitats, but were driven out throughout the 20th century. Within the last two decades, however, they quietly began making their way back. They\u2019re trotting through the parks. They\u2019re crossing streets. They\u2019re hopping on the roof of bars.\nWhile there\u2019s no official count (though some organizations have estimates for specific cities) coyotes have been spotted living in Chicago, Denver, Washington DC, and New York in addition to San Francisco, as well as in Madison, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon.\nAnd as coyotes become more visible, coyote enthusiasts nationwide have found themselves stepping into the role of both coyote defender and educator, fighting the very human instinct to shun what is unfamiliar and encouraging instead the concept of coexistence.\n\u201cSeeing something that seems so wild, a really standard response is to say they have no place in an urban setting,\u201d said Jaymi Heimbuch, director of the Urban Coyote Initiative. \u201cBut coyotes used to be here before San Francisco was ever built. Now they\u2019re back, and they\u2019re not going away. How do we deal with it? How do we minimize conflict?\u201d\nIn general, conflict is already minimal. Coyotes tend to keep to themselves and shy away from humans. They are known to sometimes exhibit defensive behavior around dogs \u2013 and sometimes prey on small unattended pets \u2013 but the average coyote is only 45lbs, said Mark Weckel, one of the co-founders of the Gotham Coyote Project in New York.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always concern, but for the most part, coyotes don\u2019t pose a threat to humans,\u201d Weckel said. \u201cCoyotes do so well in urban areas because they do so well in avoiding us.\u201d\nThe last reported negative coyote-human interaction in New York occurred in 1995, Weckel noted, before anyone realized that coyotes were making their way back into urban spaces. The best course of action should anyone come across a coyote in an urban setting is to just walk away.\nThis push in coyote research comes almost out of necessity. Yes, researchers say, coyotes are apex predators that sometimes have a taste for small dogs \u2013 but they also mate for life. They form social relationships. They play and explore and make their homes in places no one expects them to be.\nAnthropomorphizing \u2013 projecting human traits to animals \u2013 is typically frowned upon in the scientific world. But when humans and animals live in such close proximity to one another, it\u2019s hard not to make that connection.\n\u201cOne of the reasons why I love coyotes is that they are so much like us,\u201d Heimbuch said. \u201cWe are just like, \u2018Oh, this place looks good. Well, this is home now. Look no further.\u2019 I think that\u2019s awesome.\u201d\nBut at a certain point, there\u2019s anthropomorphizing and then there\u2019s just observation. In the 12 years that San Francisco\u2019s Coyote Lady, Janet Kessler, has spent photographing, tracking, and writing about the city\u2019s coyotes on her website, she has observed enough to know that coyotes live full lives, sometimes without anyone noticing.\n\u201cIt takes time,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go to a park and pick it up. Spend years in that park and you\u2019ll find out who\u2019s Dad, who\u2019s Mom, the pups that are last year\u2019s, the pups that are this year\u2019s, who likes each other, who gets along, who is sort of shy and withdrawn and who doesn\u2019t mind being seen. It all comes out.\u201d\nAlmost every day Kessler goes to a city park where the coyotes are known to frequent, usually once early in the morning and once just before dusk, with her waist-length hair pulled back low and her heavy gear strapped around her waist. On one recent afternoon, Kessler made her way onto a narrow path on a hill in a San Francisco park, navigating her lean frame over the uneven ground with ease. She let out a breath at the telltale sight of a dark brown pile. \u201cCoyote scat,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cWe found their trail.\u201d\nWhen asked how she knew it was coyote scat and not dog poop, she went into detail about the musty smell, the ropey look of the feces, the seeds, the fur. \u201cYou just know after a while,\u201d she said.\nThis was how Kessler knew the puffs of fur in another part of the park belonged to a dog, not a coyote. It was how she knew the little paw prints in the mud were not made by coyotes (\u201cCoyotes have more elongated paws,\u201d she explained, \u201cand their two middle fingers point inward\u201d).\nIt was how, out of the farthest possible corner of her eye, nearly 400ft away, she spotted a coyote that she referred to as Big Red.\n\u2018\u201cThere! There!\u201d she said, scrambling down a hillside. \u201cCoyote, first coyote sighting!\u201d\nKessler kept one whole other bramble-filled slope between her and the rust-tinged animal before she began to snap her photos, but even from that distance, she could recognize him as one half of the breeding pair that frequented that area. She recognized him in the same way she can recognize all the other coyotes she has documented \u2013 by their faces, by their gaits, by their personalities. \u201cI study them as individuals because that\u2019s what they are,\u201d Kessler said.\n\u201cEvery coyote is different,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery coyote has its own personality. I tell you, it\u2019s not so different from watching humans.\u201d",

Its success will inevitably pave the way for more ambitious creators, would-be auteurs and flagrant imitators who, just like Bandersnatch\u2019s protagonist Stefan, are eager to explore what can happen when the outcome of their stories is decided by the viewer.\nOf course, video games have been playing with the power of narrative decision-making since the 1980s. There\u2019s now a huge catalogue of interactive stories spanning genres from anime-romance to horror, crime thriller to supernatural chiller. Here are five of the best.\nAvailable on: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, iOS\nThis interactive spin-off of the hit TV show has you regularly wrestling with your morality as you guide a young girl named Clementine and her companions along a post-apocalyptic journey that showcases the necessity of selfishness when it comes to survival.\nThe game\u2019s shining moments come in how it handles group dynamics. There\u2019s no pleasing everyone and often in The Walking Dead, saving one life will make you complicit in the death of somebody else. Friends can become enemies at the touch of a button and leave you regretting choices you made just moments earlier. If zombies aren\u2019t your thing, check out the sadly defunct developer Telltale Games\u2019 other releases such as Batman, Game of Thrones and Minecraft. The Wolf Among Us is especially good, a fantastic adaptation of the Fables comics, which throw fairytale characters into a seedy Manhattan community.\nAvailable on: iOS, Microsoft Windows, Android\nAn interactive crime drama, Her Story boasts a level of narrative detail and complexity that is simply astounding. You play the role of a detective at your computer, watching interview footage of a suspect in order to solve the disappearance of a man named Simon.\nIt\u2019s Simon\u2019s wife, Hannah, who is the main suspect being interviewed. You must pay careful attention to her words and behaviour, typing in new keywords to find further evidence. Her Story is unlike any other video game out there, and definitely worth the time of any interactive movie fan or detective thriller.\nAvailable on: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, iOS\nMax Caulfield is a talented young photographer studying at Blackwell Academy, a high school hiding a dark secret. After discovering she has the power to rewind time, she finds that the smallest decisions can dramatically change the future. Its high school setting provides the perfect canvas for an angsty teenage adventure that sensitively handles many of the themes associated with coming-of-age tales \u2013 family feuds and friendship in particular.\nOften, the choices you make in the game are dictated by the way you respond during conversation. In one scenario, you find yourself on a rooftop with a suicidal classmate, trying to talk her down. Life Is Strange is a slow burner, with some awkward writing in the first couple of episodes, but once it gets going, it\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster that may have you close to tears. A good one to play with friends or family, as you agonise over decisions and share poignant moments.\nAvailable on: PlayStation 4\nEight teenagers visit a spooky lodge, out in the middle of nowhere, on the anniversary of their friend going missing \u2013 what could possibly go wrong? This schlocky, intentionally cliched horror game is an adrenaline-fuelled experience where your decisions will either save the game\u2019s protagonists or see them killed.\nThe number of outcomes on offer makes Until Dawn particularly fun to revisit until you find a way to save everyone \u2013 first time through, your decision-making is often fuelled by impulse decisions during terrifying chase scenes. Like its slasher movie counterparts, Until Dawn suffers from a muddy plot structure, but that isn\u2019t enough to detract from the frantic pace and intriguing mystery. Equal praise needs to be given to its disgustingly dissonant soundtrack, scored by Jason Graves.\nAvailable on: PlayStation 4\n\u201cI did not murder him!\u201d It\u2019s difficult not to draw comparisons between the characters and aesthetic of I, Robot and Detroit, and while they both explore stories of sentient androids, Detroit\u2019s story is told from the perspective of these androids: courageous police investigator Connor, defiant former companion Markus and housekeeper Kara, all beginning to question their relationship with humans. Your decisions in the game tackle difficult themes, and it\u2019s not hard to become emotionally invested in any of its three characters as you guide them towards their freedom \u2013 or not. Detroit lays bare the effects of your decisions in giant flow-charts that show just how much variation there is in the story.",

Schlieper is the agent of Ajax\u2019s much-admired Argentinian left-back Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico, and told the Buenos Aires station Radio Rivadavia that he had heard his client\u2019s \u201cname is on Real Madrid\u2019s list, because Marcelo will go to Juventus in the summer\u201d.\nThis would of course free up Alex Sandro to complete a long-rumoured move to [insert name of pretty much every European megaclub here]. \u201cAjax have decided on their selling price,\u201d Schlieper claimed of Tagliafico. \u201cWhich clubs are interested? All I can say is that among them is a Spanish giant which has decided that now is the right time for Tagliafico to take that leap in quality.\u201d\nIf Marcelo does end up in Turin he might have Mauro Icardi for a teammate. Repubblica say that even though Inter have fallen out with their attacking ace so emphatically that they have stripped him of the captaincy and he has spent the last couple of matches on the sidelines (though injury also played a part in that). Inter have offered Icardi a cleverly-constructed new contract, which will reduce his release clause from a frankly unachievable \u20ac110m to a potentially gettable \u20ac80m.\nThus the door has been opened for deep-pocketed potential purchasers, but today\u2019s Corriere dello Sport insists on its front page that only Juventus and Napoli are likely to be able to buy him, even though \u201ca proposal will arrive from a great foreign club which will be impossible to refuse\u201d, because the 26-year-old \u201cdoes not want to leave Italy\u201d. \u201cFor family and personal reasons a clear line has been drawn: the Icardi family does not intend to leave the country,\u201d they write. Though as it happens they wrote that on the very day that Icardi\u2019s family did leave the country, his wife and agent Wanda departing for a mini-break in Dubai with her five children.\nManchester United and Liverpool are among clubs that have been alerted to the availability of James Rodr\u00edguez, reports the Mirror. The Colombian\u2019s two-year loan from Real Madrid to Bayern Munich will end in the summer and the German club\u2019s president, Uli Hoene\u00df, has insisted that \u201cif the coach does not use him, I\u2019m not going to spend \u20ac42m\u201d. The attacking midfielder has played the full 90 minutes of a league game just twice this season, most recently on Saturday against Hertha Berlin.\nAndrea Radrizzani will put Leeds United up for sale if they fail to seal promotion this season, says the Mail. \u201cThe ramifications of not going up have been made clear to those connected to the club,\u201d they note, \u201cand insiders have noted an increased anxiety to executives on matchdays.\u201d Though Radrizzani later took to Twitter to describe the story as \u201ca lot of nonsense\u201d.\nAnd finally Fulham had to cancel a team bonding go-karting outing because they couldn\u2019t afford the insurance, Tom \n Car-neary Cairney has revealed. \u201cWe did book go-karting,\u201d he said, \u201cbut insurance was too high so it got cancelled.

        "content": "Tate Modern, LondonHer disturbing art is the climax of surrealism, but this exhibition also reveals Tanning\u2019s appetite for the gothic and its long history of female creativity\nI\u2019m looking into a seedy hotel room. The lights are low. Bodies are sprouting from cracks in the walls. A creature straight out of a Bosch vision of hell is creeping, or is it seeping, out of the fireplace. Worst of all, somehow, is a human(ish) leg emerging from an armchair and stretching across the room. All the monstrosities in Dorothea Tanning\u2019s 1970 installation Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot are made of soft stuffed fabric that intensifies their uncanny effect. These stitched-together textiles bulging with mysterious innards are queasily corporeal. This life-sized room from a fleapit Paris hotel is infected with nameless terrors and depraved memories.\nPerhaps they are memories of surrealism. For Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot is surely the last great masterpiece of this movement founded by French poets after the first world war. Surrealism called for an art of the unconscious, inspired by Sigmund Freud\u2019s writings on dreams and sexuality. Dorothea Tanning, who was born in small-town Illinois in 1910, was one of a generation of US artists who fell in love with surrealism and, in her case, a surrealist \u2013 in 1946 she married Max Ernst. Tanning\u2019s late works are revealed as a sensational climax of the surrealist movement by Tate Modern\u2019s sensitive and fascinating reappraisal of her. But this gorgeous trip through 20th-century dreams and nightmares also shows that she was never simply a surrealist, let alone a mere follower of the movement\u2019s European founders. Something else pervades her imagination \u2013 an appetite for the gothic and its long history of female creativity.\n\u201cA Mrs Radcliffe Called Today\u201d, says the writing on a wall in her 1944 painting of the same title. It\u2019s a homage to Ann Radcliffe, the 18th-century gothic novelist who wrote The Mysteries of Udolpho. Tanning\u2019s painting depicts a castle wall and a flying buttress. A ghost walks past the castle with fire for a head. Her disembodied hair seems to have rematerialised in an archway. Tanning was not the first surrealist to declare her love of gothic novels. In his Manifesto of Surrealism published in 1924, the movement\u2019s founder Andr\u00e9 Breton praises the \u201cunforgettable intensity\u201d of Matthew Lewis\u2019s 1796 novel The Monk. Yet there\u2019s a difference. Breton exhibited the ingrained prejudices of the male surrealists, men of their time, when he drooled that The Monk\u2019s heroine Mathilda is \u201cless a character than a continual temptation\u201d. Tanning, as if to deliberately overturn this surrealist cult of great male perverts of the past resurrects Radcliffe, whose novels closely identified with the feelings and perceptions of women.\nTanning\u2019s art is full of haunted houses and sinister, inexplicable happenings that owe as much to gothic novels as they do to Breton or Ernst. In her 1943 painting Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, a door in a vast and echoing hotel is opening to reveal an unholy glow inside: the other rooms on the floor are grimly shut while two girls sleepwalk on the landing. One has hair flowing upward as if she\u2019s underwater. A giant sunflower has materialised. What horror lurks in the roomful of light? A premonition of the A-bomb? A furnace for corpses? It\u2019s 1943.\nIn her 1950-2 painting The Guest Room, a naked girl stands in an attitude of frozen alienation while a young woman lies in bed hugging a male doll. It\u2019s a very strange set-up, but what\u2019s most troubling is a short fat figure wearing cowboy boots and a blue head-covering that seems to conceal facial deformities or inhuman tubes under its folds.\nA bit David Lynch, right? But decades ahead of the surrealist film-maker. Tanning spent much of her life in France, but this exhibition reveals her as a great American artist. Her feel for gothic is reminiscent of the stories of her contemporary US writers Carson McCullers and Shirley Jackson. These are paintings of nightmares remembered in tantalising fragments.\nThen, in 1970, on that awful night in room 202 of the H\u00f4tel du Pavot, those nightmares crawl off the canvas into our own, three-dimensional world. Her monsters swarm the walls and bulge out of the upholstery. It made perfect sense for Tanning to make the leap from painting to this pioneering masterpiece of installation art. The staircases and doorways, cupboards and ruins that populate her early paintings find claustrophobia and unease in the structures that enclose us. That obsession with buildings haunts the entire gothic tradition, but for Tanning it is also an angry dissection of the \u201cnormal\u201d bourgeois house and the prisoners it contains. In her 1954 canvas Family Portrait, a doll-like blonde wife is literally dwarfed by the colossal man of the house in his mirrored glasses.\nIf Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot doesn\u2019t upset you at first, keep looking. It\u2019s an insidiously atmospheric real-life space \u2013 a film set of the mind. And it\u2019s just one of the revolutionary artworks Tanning created at a time when surrealism was supposedly old hat. Her sewn-together fabric sculptures that culminate in her freaky hotel room are the greatest things she ever made. Reclining Nude, created in 1969-70, is a pink body that twists and truncates in inexplicable, upsetting ways. Embrace (1969) is a soft toy from hell. A brown furry gorilla-like form is \u201cembracing\u201d \u2013 or assaulting \u2013 another mutant female nude.\nJust to describe these sculptures is to recognise how contemporary they seem. There are clear connections between Don Juan\u2019s Breakfast (1972), in which pink flesh bubbles up out of a black beer stein, pressing at a buttoned seam, and the work of artists from Sarah Lucas to Cathy de Monchaux. Did I say Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot is the final masterpiece of surrealism? Revise that. It\u2019s the door between surrealism\u2019s bad dreams and ours.\n Dorothea Tanning is at Tate Modern, London, from 27 February until 9 June.",

        "content": "Patients face unprepared GPs and long consultation waiting lists, the Guardian reveals\nTrans men and women are being left humiliated and desperate after seeking care from their GP, according to a Guardian investigation that has shed light on serious flaws in how the NHS treats transgender patients.\nHundreds of transgender people responded to a request from the Guardian to describe their experience of navigating the NHS, with the most common complaints coming from patients who felt their GP did not understand gender dysphoria, were not adequately trained to deal with their needs, and erroneously referred patients to mental health services.\nSerious systemic issues across the NHS were also revealed, including the confusion and delay in being seen at a gender identity clinic. When a GP sees a patient who could have gender dysphoria, they are referred to a GIC for diagnosis and to potentially begin the process of medical transitioning. While individuals should be seen within 18 weeks of referral, waiting lists for GICs can be of more than two years, with little or no support provided in the interval. The result is a limbo, with one person describing the prospect of surgery as so distant, and communication so lacking, that the situation was \u201csoul-destroying\u201d.\nThe Guardian has found that the impact of these delays is far reaching, creating tensions between doctors and patients that have led to an erosion of trust in the healthcare system among many trans people.\nA key issue is that delays in being seen at a GIC often puts a medical transition on hold \u2013 which is something trans men and women said jeopardises their physical and mental health.\nCurrently GPs are given information on how to prescribe hormones and interpret the necessary blood tests by specialists at a GIC.\nThe General Medical Council says \u201cbridging\u201d hormone treatment can be prescribed by GPs before a patient attends a GIC, but only if the individual is suicidal or at risk of self-harming, and is already taking medication bought online or elsewhere. The GP must also take advice from a gender specialist and prescribe the lowest acceptable dose. However many GPs say they do not have the experience to prescribe hormones before a patient has been seen by a GIC, while getting the required advice from gender specialists to help with bridging hormones takes a long time as services are over capacity.\nJosie King\u2019s daughter, Rose, went to her doctor to talk about being transgender at 18 but was refused bridging treatment, despite King embarking on a letter-writing mission to try to change their minds.\n\u201cShe was losing her hair \u2013 a receding hairline \u2013 and you can imagine for somebody in her position, that was absolutely devastating. So she needed the testosterone blockers really as quickly as possible to halt that,\u201d said King, adding that Rose\u2019s mental health was fluctuating \u2013 something King believes hormone treatment could have helped stabilise.\nKing said her daughter had to turn to sourcing hormones through an online service. However after a lengthy battle, their new GP surgery has agreed to take over prescribing the hormones and monitoring Rose\u2019s blood tests.\nKamilla Kamaruddin, a GP who is herself a trans woman, said prescribing and monitoring such medications for trans patients is not simple.\n\u201cIt is how GPs work, not just about transgender [issues] but other things. If they are not happy to initiate prescribing, then they refer on to the hospitals,\u201d Kamaruddin said, adding that monitoring hormone levels in the blood can be tricky. \u201cThe GPs don\u2019t know what to do if the results are abnormal or too high,\u201d she said, adding GPs are not trained to provide the psychological support that patients also need.\nAnother GP with trans patients, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \u201cIf I prescribe as a GP and something goes wrong, that\u2019s all on my shoulders and could be a career-ending decision for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it sounds drastic, and it\u2019s admittedly unlikely, but it\u2019s certainly possible to harm someone with hormone treatment if you\u2019re not experienced with the condition you\u2019re treating.\u201d\nBut some GPs have felt confident prescribing hormones. One of these is Dr Helen Webberley, who set up a website called GenderGP, through which trans people could access doctors and receive hormone prescriptions. \u201cWhat these patients need is very, very simple,\u201d she told the Guardian, adding that while there are no UK guidelines for prescribing, the University of California San Francisco has produced a \u201cbeautiful\u201d set that she used. However Webberley has become a controversial figure: she was convicted in 2018 of operating the company Online GP Services Ltd without the necessary registration, receiving a bill for fines and costs totalling more than \u00a325,000, and she is under investigation by the General Medical Council. But Webberley remains adamant that she and her husband, also a doctor, are in the right. \u201cThey haven\u2019t beaten me yet. They haven\u2019t beaten us yet,\u201d she said.\nBeyond bridging hormones, current guidance from the General Medical Council makes it clear that once a patient has a recommendation for a hormone prescription from a GIC, doctors should take over. However even with this in place doctors can be anxious to issue hormones if there is no \u201cshared care agreement\u201d \u2013 a formal plan which clearly sets out the responsibilities of the GIC and the GP, allows specialists to get involved if challenges emerge, and reduces costs to GP surgeries.\nEric, 36, said setting up his hormone prescriptions with a new GP was invariably problematic. \u201cIt just seems to instil a sense of absolute blind panic in them and they insist that I am referred back to the gender identity clinic,\u201d he said, adding that one doctor said she was not going to prescribe his hormones without him returning to a GIC \u2013 which would have meant joining the waiting lists again. \u201cShe basically held my medication hostage, hormones I have been on since I was 21-22,\u201d he said, adding the doctor eventually relented when experts at the GIC confirmed he required hormones and that he did not need to be seen by them.\nWithout the hormone treatment, said Eric, the initial result is exhaustion and mood swings, which could also be followed by a return of menstruation and even potentially regrowth of breast tissue. \u201cPsychologically it would be fairly catastrophic,\u201d he said.\nFollowing a lengthy consultation, the NHS recently released new specifications for gender identity services to be funded and delivered, which come into force this year. People will be able to self refer to GICs \u2013 or gender dysphoria clinics, as they will now be called. However the new specifications offer no solution to the issue of bridging hormones. \u201cBridging prescriptions are not commissioned by NHS England \u2013 the point of them is to cover the period before patient\u2019s enter services commissioned by NHS England,\u201d an NHS press officer said.\nThe documents do, however, refer to setting up \u201cprimary care multidisciplinary teams\u201d \u2013 in other words, local trans health services \u2013 which might offer more timely access to local services, and tackle the problems of GPs being reluctant to prescribe hormones. The proposals are still in development, but the NHS is currently in the process of setting up a pilot in Greater Manchester. The NHS says if this is successful, it would mean the majority of trans people would not need to go to a gender dysphoria clinic \u2013 which would tackle complex cases \u2013 but could receive care locally, including a diagnosis, psychological support, voice therapy and hormone treatments.\nKamaruddin welcomed the proposals, saying such teams need to include specially trained GPs, nurses and psychologists under the guidance of GICs. But she said funding and training of GPs must be in place, as very few GPs currently have a specialism in trans healthcare.\nDr Jonathan Leach, honorary secretary of the Royal College of GPs, said a new e-learning course for GPs on gender variance is expected to be launched this year, although the details of its content remain hazy. But he reiterated that treatment should be initiated in specialist care.\n\u201cWe understand that access to specialist gender reassignment services in the NHS is inadequate, and that this is incredibly frustrating for trans patients and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cBut GPs should not have to bear the brunt of poor access to specialist services by being put in a position where they are being asked to prescribe treatment that they are not trained to prescribe or monitor safely without expert support,\u201d Leach said.\nSome names have been changed. \n In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

She is appealing against her conviction at a hearing scheduled for 5 March.\nAssociates believe that Onasanya, who voted for remain in the EU referendum, may return to parliament this week. She insisted before she was jailed that she would continue to represent her constituents while maintaining her innocence.\nShe has voted 12 times in the Commons since her conviction on 19 December. On eight of those occasions she voted on the government\u2019s Brexit plans, including voting against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal in January.\nWhether she is able to vote on Wednesday will depend in part on the terms of her curfew. The vote is expected to be held at around 7pm.\nOnasanya, 35, sat in the back of a white Vauxhall with the closest window to her covered by a hi-vis jacket as it drove past photographers.\nShe continues to sit as an independent MP, despite calls for her resignation. Under parliamentary rules, a prison sentence of at least 12 months is required for the automatic removal of an MP. A lesser sentence can result in a recall petition, however, which would result in a byelection if it is signed by more than 10% of the electorate in the constituency.\nIt emerged on Tuesday that two police forces are investigating racist emails and letters sent to Onasanya. Cambridgeshire and South Yorkshire police have been asked to examine \u201cmalicious communications\u201d sent to her office, the Peterborough Telegraph reported.\nOnasanya\u2019s communications officer, Matt Turner, said: \u201cMany of these emails and letters have a disgusting racial element to them.\u201d\nJurors at the Old Bailey were told Onasanya had colluded with her brother Festus after her car was clocked at 41mph in a 30mph zone in the village of Thorney near Peterborough in July 2017.\nShe was sent a notice of intended prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of her brother, who was away visiting his parents in Russia.\nFestus Onasanya was sentenced to 10 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice over speeding, including in relation to the 24 July incident.\nThe attorney general\u2019s office ruled that Onasanya\u2019s sentence was not unduly lenient, after a complaint was lodged.",

        "content": "The defensive midfielder was 30 before she made her debut for the US. She tells Gemma Clarke about her journey to the top of the game\nWhen she was 12 years old, McCall Zerboni saw her first live soccer match.\nWith the letters USA hand-drawn on her shirt and her blonde hair braided in three sections and sprayed red, white and blue, she joined her mom, twin sister and more than 90,000 eager spectators at the Rose Bowl for the 1999 World Cup final.\nZerboni recalls taking a deep breath, looking around and thinking: \u201cWow. All these people came here to watch those women down on the field. And those women are such bosses, they\u2019re handling it all like it\u2019s no problem,\u201d she tells the Guardian.\nShe then witnessed one of most unforgettable moments in sporting history: after 120 minutes of nerve-juddering deadlock, the US won the World Cup with a Brandi Chastain\u2019s penalty and the crowd wildly celebrated the shootout victory in the sweltering Pasadena heat. Up in the stands, Zerboni was profoundly affected. \u201cThey showed me what strength is,\u201d she says.\nTwenty years later, Zerboni is finally on the brink of reaching the World Cup as a member of the US squad. And, more than anything, she has needed strength to get here.\nShe made her first international appearance in 2017, just a few months shy of her 31st birthday, making her the oldest debutant in the history of the US women\u2019s team. Since then she has earned four more caps, and will be hoping to get more game time in the SheBelieves Cup, which begins for the US on Wednesday when they take on Japan in Pennsylvania. The tournament is both a dry run and a chance for lesser-known players to impress and stake their claim for a spot at June\u2019s World Cup.\nZerboni has taken the \u201clong road\u201d to the top, though she has played professionally for more than a decade. Her story is inspiring, but it\u2019s more than a never-too-late-to-fulfill-your-dreams-narrative or testament to her single-mindedness and immense determination. Since it\u2019s a story about women\u2019s sports, it\u2019s also a story about inequality, of professional female athletes earning wages so low they can barely keep their heads above water, let alone focus exclusively on their game.\nShe grew up in the California beach town of San Clemente, one of two sets of twins in a family of seven siblings. Her parents divorced not long before the final in \u201999, leaving her mother to raise all seven children, feed them and ferry them to school and extra-curricular activities. Soccer was a big part of family life; Zerboni and her twin, Blake, began playing when they were four. Both showed early promise.\nZerboni won awards throughout high school, joined the Olympic Development Program as a teenager and earned a place in the US Under-17s team in 2003. She and Blake played together at UCLA, but she alone progressed to the professional leagues, signing for Los Angeles Sol in the WPS.\nShe played for three different teams in three years before the WPS folded, then started out in the newly-formed NWSL at a time when the minimum annual pay was under $8,000. In the off-season, Zerboni took whatever work she could get. For her, the low point came after six years of playing professionally and struggling to make ends meet. She found herself wandering along the beach front near her home, trying to sell packets of nutritional gel to passing surfers.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, professional soccer player in the season, then in the off-season, I\u2019m basically walking on the beach, begging people to give me their money because I can barely survive.\u2019\u201d And though she drew positives from the experience, chiefly the belief that you should try to take pride in everything you do, it highlights a potent issue: a contract with US Soccer gives a financial cushion that most NWSL teams cannot yet provide.\nThings are improving, but much of the league\u2019s growth relies on grassroots support, such as the many fans who buy season tickets to teams around the country and donate them, in order to bring more people to the games. Zerboni is grateful for all the backing she has received, and that she has been able to grow and improve over time in the league. But she can\u2019t help wondering what might have been possible had the infrastructure of women\u2019s soccer been more advanced.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d had the resources and capabilities to put more into my job, and more focus, instead of going to train at little camps every night or going to work after training in the afternoon, would I be further long, would I be a better footballer? I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s what I needed to do to survive at the time. If I\u2019d had more resources, maybe I\u2019d have got here faster, but that\u2019s just not the journey I was able to take.\u201d\nWith her twin as her personal trainer, and no small amount of grit, Zerboni established herself as one of the standouts in the league; her form for NWSL champions North Carolina Courage has been hard to ignore. And US coach Jill Ellis has made it clear in her call-ups that form is paramount.\nSmall but strong at 5ft 4in, Zerboni has a wealth of skills. A defensive midfielder who will fight for every ball and throw her body in harm\u2019s way, she also covers a vast amount of ground, finds space up front and scores goals. As a character, she exudes positivity and continually shouts encouragement to her teammates. She\u2019s the kind of player whose presence would benefit the US at a World Cup: versatile, vocal and filled with an innately American zeal.\nIn the 20 years since 1999, members of that World Cup-winning team have deliberated on the power of adversity, how their struggle to earn recognition fed their spirit and gave them the impetus to succeed. It is an ethos Zerboni can certainly relate to.\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t thought about giving up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the small flame inside of me that wouldn\u2019t burn out - that\u2019s the reason I have this opportunity now.\u201d\nGemma Clarke\u2019s book, Soccerwomen: The Icons, Rebels, Stars, and Trailblazers Who Transformed the Beautiful Game is out in April.",

        "content": "Warren Gatland would prefer to be under the radar as the win over England raises World Cup expectations\nSix thousand miles separate Cardiff and Tokyo but Warren Gatland knew the inevitable question was coming anyway. Having just seen off England and risen to third in the world rankings, did he now expect Wales to go big in Japan at this year\u2019s Rugby World Cup? \u201cApparently not, according to a lot of pundits out there,\u201d came the brusque reply. \u201cWe just want to keep under the radar if we possibly can.\u201d\nHe might have added that linking Six Nations form and World Cup potential is far from an exact science. England in 2003 have so far been the only side in either hemisphere ever to have lifted the Webb Ellis Cup having won a big tournament \u2013 the Six Nations or the Rugby Championship \u2013 in the same calendar year. As with a tennis player winning the Australian Open, there are no guarantees of success at Wimbledon.\nBetter, perhaps, to treat the Six Nations as a mood enhancer rather than a sure indicator of impending greatness. The weather, the style of rugby, the atmosphere in the stadiums \u2013 World Cups can often be a completely different ball game. That said, the psychology of having to win five tough Tests in a row is not entirely dissimilar. In 2003 England were challenged by Clive Woodward to treat their grand-slam decider in Ireland as an absolute must-win fixture if they had any pretensions to becoming world champions. After thrashing the Irish 42-6, there was no stopping them.\nNot everyone accepts this binary theory. Eddie Jones prefers to remember 2007 when he was bussed in as a consultant to help Jake White drag a misfiring South Africa from Tri Nations despair to the top of the world. The All Blacks have won the past two World Cups despite Australia winning both the Tri Nations in 2011 and the Rugby Championship in 2015. It appears to suit the Kiwi psyche best to go into the tournament with zero complacency having just received a sharp kick to the posterior.\nIn that respect, maybe Cardiff was exactly what Jones\u2019s team needed. Had they romped away largely unchallenged to a grand slam it would not have exposed the faultlines that Wales uncovered so expertly. It also reminded all and sundry to be tactically flexible and to assume nothing. Maybe Wales, not Ireland, will prove to be the big European predators in Japan. Might England, in the event of topping their tough pool, now face Australia rather than Wales in a quarter-final? Those English supporters who thought defeat in Cardiff was the end of the world have clearly not considered losing to Wales in a World Cup final.\nWales, either way, are now free to use the last two weekends of the Six Nations as a full-on dress rehearsal. In essence they have just won a last-eight knockout fixture and are 160 minutes from glory. Beating Scotland will set up a massive showdown with Ireland, among their prospective World Cup semi-final opponents in Yokohama in October. Collect a grand slam and, regardless of history, no one will be rushing to play them in Japan.\nIt is in this tricky area of developing unflinching self-belief that Gatland is so good. No one would say the British and Irish Lions trained harder than any other side has ever done in New Zealand in 2017 but they still emerged with a drawn series with minimal pre-tour preparation. The knack of getting the right players \u2013 selection also matters hugely \u2013 into the right state of mind to go the extra mile for the people around them is the trademark of all good coaches, as is ensuring they peak in the games that really count.\nEngland, as Gatland has already observed, have not always found this straightforward. For an assortment of reasons \u2013 and even with the benefit of home advantage in 2015 \u2013 England have flattered to deceive in the past two, if not three, World Cups. They may have reached the final in 2007 but only after losing so heavily to South Africa in the pool stages some players had their bags packed on the morning of their quarter-final against Australia in Marseille in expectation of heading home.\nNo one is saying England are scared of big occasions, as Dublin demonstrated. It is fair to say, though, that they have a tendency to start Six Nations tournaments better than they finish them. Of their last nine final-round championship games they have lost five. Some teams, most notably France at World Cups, improve the longer they spend together in camp. England, for some reason, have tended to do the opposite.\nIt might just be Eddie Jones\u2019s biggest challenge over the next seven months: allowing his players sufficient time off to refresh their minds rather than squeezing them endlessly through the sausage machine. The moral of the story? Wales may be leading the battle for Six Nations supremacy but they have not yet won the war.\nEddie Jones reckons rugby is growing more like American football in terms of the number and length of breaks in play. A degree of anticipation is a key part of the matchday experience but the day must be fast approaching when a limit is imposed on how much time scrums are allowed to soak up. There was a good example in Lyon\u2019s Top 14 fixture against Clermont when a scrum was awarded late in the game with Lyon narrowly leading. It took a painfully slow two minutes, after an inevitable reset, for the ball to emerge, by which stage there were only a few mundane seconds remaining. Stopping the clock until the ball is out \u2013 particularly towards the end of matches \u2013 would give spectators rather better value for money.\nNever mind the Six Nations, these are critical days in the Guinness Premiership relegation dogfight. Worcester\u2019s win over Leicester on Sunday has left Newcastle nine points adrift at the foot of the table; should the Falcons lose at home to the Warriors this Sunday and Bristol beat Gloucester at Ashton Gate the gap will extend into double figures. Newcastle may have finished fourth last season but their play-off semi-final against Exeter now feels a long time ago.",

        "content": "Spain\u2019s record scorer on revolutionising football in her home city and her petition to get female players on computer games\nTowards the end of 2018 Vero Boquete, Spain\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer who has won a Champions League and domestic titles in three countries, received \u201cthe biggest prize\u201d of her career.\nIn her home city of Santiago de Compostela \u2013 in Galicia in the north-west of Spain and famous for being the climax of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route \u2013 the main stadium was renamed the Estadio Vero Boquete de San L\u00e1zaro.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to describe and explain what I feel because it\u2019s a historic emblematic stadium \u2013 it was a first division stadium,\u201d says Boquete, of the ground she spent almost every weekend at as a child.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest show of love from my city, from my people \u2013 they are my neighbours. But it\u2019s not about my name, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s name in a main stadium, in football; that is just fantastic.\u201d\nWhat is also remarkable is that where most are long retired before tributes of this magnitude are paid, the 31-year-old Boquete is still playing at the top level.\nThe decorated Galician could legitimately be described as Spain\u2019s First Lady of football. Having spent a not wholly satisfying year in China with Beijing BG Phoenix, she is preparing for a return to arguably the world\u2019s best league, the NWSL, with Utah Royals. There she will be reunited with players such as Christen Press, Becca Moros, Amy Rodriguez and others she has lined up alongside during spells across Europe and the US which included time at Sweden\u2019s Tyres\u00f6 FF, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain.\nBy her moved to Asia it could have been considered that her career was on the wane but Utah Royals\u2019 manager, Laura Harvey, thought otherwise and the opportunity to work with the former Birmingham and Arsenal manager was a big pull.\n\u201cI lost the [play-off] final a few years ago, so there was something inside of me that made me want to come back and fight for the title again,\u201d Boquete says. \u201cAnother reason was Laura Harvey. I\u2019ve followed her career for many years and I was really interested in working with her.\n\u201cShe was really specific about why she wanted me there and what she expected from me. That, for a player, is really important.\u201d\nBoquete, far from feeling past her peak, believes she can get better. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every country I\u2019ve played in, I\u2019m a better player for playing in different leagues with different styles. Now, in the US, I just want to put everything together and take my game to another level.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\n\u201cI want to keep going until my body says it\u2019s over. At the moment I feel great, I think I\u2019m in one of the best moments of my career in how I feel and also how I understand the game. That experience helps you a lot.\u201d\nShe may be an idol in her region, and country but growing up playing football wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI started to play when I started to walk,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad was a coach and my brother played so I just wanted to do the same. I was all the time with them, playing at home, in the street.\n\u201cThen, when I was five or six years old, I joined my first team. For the first year I couldn\u2019t play, because there was a rule that said girls can\u2019t play with boys. So for one year I was just training and I went to the games but couldn\u2019t play. But the love of the game was already inside of me.\u201d\nShe was the only girl playing football in the city and she was the reason that rule was changed. \u201cFor me, for so many years, because I played football with boys until I was 15, football was almost an individual sport because I didn\u2019t have a life in the locker room or things that make it a team sport.\n\u201cAnd I grew up without knowing what was possible. I didn\u2019t have any woman reference because there was no information about it.\n\u201cMy first role model in football was Marta and she\u2019s not much older than me. After a few years we were playing together in Sweden. So I think that is really important, especially here in my country, that girls grow up supporting football, supporting women\u2019s football and they have a familiar reference.\u201d\nBeing a role model herself doesn\u2019t faze her; \u201cit\u2019s a motivation,\u201d she says. \u201cI get more than I give. To know that people, girls, are watching me, following me and want to be like me, that makes me work harder, makes me more ambitious and makes me want to fight for our rights and better conditions for the girls that are coming in behind.\u201d\nIn 2013 a small act of frustration snowballed in a way she never expected. Boquete set up a petition calling on EA Sports to include female footballers in the Fifa computer games, and tens of thousands signed. \u201cMany said I wanted it just so I could play as myself. But it was never about that. I didn\u2019t play it, I didn\u2019t like video games but I saw it could be a fantastic tool and there was an opportunity for it to demonstrate equality.\u201d Two years later women were in the game.\nA belief in giving back is what made Boquete sign up to her compatriot Juan Mata\u2019s Common Goal initiative. \u201cIt is a movement, it comes from football, the leaders are football players \u2013 already that makes you feel something,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in social justice and, when I knew about Common Goal and I knew Juan Mata was there, I called him saying: \u2018OK, I want to be inside this.\u2019\n\u201cFootball gave us and is giving us so many things and has changed our lives. I think that makes us more socially grounded, so for me we have to give something back. One per cent of our salaries, 1% of all the money that this industry moves is nothing. The power of football is just crazy.\u201d\n The BBC has announced it will broadcast live coverage of all England\u2019s pre-World Cup friendlies, including the threeSheBelieves Cup matches. \n Manchester City\u2019s midfielder Jill Scott has pulled out of the England squad in order \u201cto manage her return to full fitness ahead of the World Cup\u201d. Scott played 120 minutes of City\u2019s Continental Cup final victory over Arsenal on Saturday. Orlando Pride\u2019s Chioma Ubogagu has been called up.\n German international Melanie Behringer has announced her plans to retire at the end of the season. The 33-year-old won the World Cup in 2007, two European Championships and the 2016 Olympics.\n Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Finland and the Faroe Islands are preparing a joint bid to host the 2027 World Cup.

        "content": "Most concrete from demolished buildings is simply dumped, much of it illegally. But there\u2019s a better way \u2013 and it involves lightning\nAt the Shenzhen dump, huge shards of dusty concrete lie in imposing piles. Once the very foundation of this Chinese city, these blocks now seem grotesque in their magnitude, and unsettling in their utter uselessness. Jumbled up with the other relics of modern construction \u2013 bricks, wood and steel \u2013 and dotted with plastic bags and bottles, it could take centuries, even millennia, for Shenzhen\u2019s discarded concrete to disintegrate back into sand.\nChina produces more construction waste than any other country - around 2 billion tonnes per year (pdf), or around 4kg per person per day. Two million tonnes of this is concrete. In Shenzhen, which has grown from a town with 30,000 residents to a megacity with 11 million in just 35 years, a full 84% of that construction waste is unceremoniously dumped. It doesn\u2019t even all make its way to official landfills, which don\u2019t have the capacity to handle it, so almost half is disposed in unlicensed sites, or illegally tipped.\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nAs our world urbanises at a pace never before seen, with buildings rising and falling in as little as 30 years, the crumbled debris of our cities often ends up in landfill. Around 10bn tonnes (pdf) of concrete are manufactured each year: a staggering one cubic metre for every person on Earth. Over the next 40 years the world is expected to build 230 billion square metres in new construction, adding the equivalent of Paris to the planet every single week.\nMuch of that new construction means knocking down old structures, and gradually engineers and policymakers are waking up to a question: what should we do with our concrete when we\u2019re finished with it?\nThe problem is particularly thorny in the developing world, where there are often limited systems in place to join the dots between demolition and new building projects. In Brazil, one of the biggest emerging economies, recycling is close to non-existent: less than 1% of Brazil\u2019s concrete waste is recycled, according to the Brazilian Association for the Recycling of Construction Waste (Abrecon). About half of Brazilian municipalities send their demolition waste directly to landfills. Many just dump it illegally.\n\u201cIf [construction] rubbish isn\u2019t collected it has serious ramifications for the public\u2019s health,\u201d said Levi Torres, coordinator of Abrecon. \u201cMany have been taken to hospital because of diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis caused by untreated, dumped rubble.\u201d\nLandfill isn\u2019t the only problem. There is a glaring need for us to drastically limit the production of new concrete and cement, which generates huge amounts of CO2, by recycling components we already have.\nThe extent to which we are recycling varies wildly between different countries in the world, from around 10% in China to 90% in Japan.\nIn most developed countries, including much of western Europe, the majority of demolished concrete is put to some use \u2013 but mostly to make low-value products like filling for roads. This process is known as \u201cdowncycling\u201d. Many researchers and engineers are searching for ways to \u201cupcycle\u201d concrete waste instead, turning old building products into new, first-rate structures and avoiding the need for new or \u201cvirgin\u201d concrete.\nRecycled concrete can be just as high quality as virgin aggregates at a lower cost \u2013 but the barriers are numerous.\nFirst there is the technical challenge of separating concrete into its constituent parts. The chief hurdle is to get the aggregate away from other contaminants, including the \u201crebar\u201d \u2013 the bars of reinforced steel that almost all concrete now contains.\nOne lab in Germany has developed a bizarre but very effective solution: zap concrete with lightning while it\u2019s immersed in water.\nLightning only tends to travel through water and air. It doesn\u2019t like the density of solid objects. However, in 2012, researchers at the Concrete Technology Group in Holzkirchen, Germany, using a high voltage fragmentation system designed and manufactured by the Swiss company SelFrag (SelectiveFragmentation), found that extremely short durations of lightning, 500 nanoseconds, can shoot through water and directly into a solid mass.\nOn striking concrete, the lightning actually travels between the different components \u2013 aggregate, cement, steel \u2013 and separates them.\nOther researchers have tried to be more holistic: demolishing with building in mind and building with demolition in mind.\nThe key problem here is that, once poured, it\u2019s more or less impossible to know what\u2019s inside concrete. Unlike steel, which is stamped and can therefore be traced back to its factory of origin to determine the exact makeup of the alloy, concrete is a grey box.\nIt has been proposed that each piece of concrete in a building have its own \u201cmaterial passport\u201d \u2013 so at the time of demolition, the passport can be used to find the concrete (or, indeed, other materials) a new home.\n\u201cOne of the biggest obstacles to a circular economy is that we\u2019re not building things for multiple life cycles,\u201d said Eva Gladek, founder and CEO of the NGO Metabolic. \u201cWe need to start designing buildings for disassembly.\u201d\nMetabolic has been working with municipalities to instigate \u201ccircular economies\u201d, by decreasing waste and promoting reuse. Last year they conducted a report for Charlotte, North Carolina, outlining ways the city could reduce waste streams. They found that around 50,000 tonnes of concrete ended up in the city\u2019s landfill each year, and the rest was simply downcycled. They proposed a new system, whereby all waste concrete would be crushed and transformed into new products for construction. According to their calculation, it would even make money: based on selling recycled concrete aggregate to concrete producers at about 80% of the price of virgin materials, the project would generate a revenue of $6.14m annually while costing just $4m.\nIt\u2019s not just about cost, unfortunately. It\u2019s also about trust \u2013 or distrust, in the case of recycled concrete.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an image problem,\u201d said Christian Glock, a professor of concrete and masonry at the University of Technology Kaiserslauternin Germany. \u201cThe construction industry wants to use the very best possible concrete \u2013 even though recycled concrete would work just as well.\u201d\nGlock is working on a cross-border research project, SeRaMCo, to develop prefabricated recycled concrete products such as walls, ceilings, benches and skate parks, and launch them in markets across northern Europe.\n\u201cWe want to show stakeholders that recycled concrete isn\u2019t second rate, it\u2019s really cool,\u201d he said.\nIn 2008, the EU set a target for 70% of construction waste to be recycled by 2020. Nonetheless, there is a huge disparity in recycling rates: some member states (Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Austria, and Latvia) recycle more than 90%, others under 10% (Finland, Greece and Cyprus). If downcycling is excluded, not a single country reaches the 70% target.\nAnother problem is that primary materials are so cheap that they\u2019re overused. One of the great flaws of free market pricing mechanisms is that external costs, such as CO2 emissions generated by the cement industry, are not factored into the price of products. There\u2019s simply little market incentive to use it sparingly and efficiently. This is as true for airplane tickets and meat as it is for concrete.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s conditions, it is more cost-effective to demolish buildings and start again from scratch, than it is to repair a building using recycled concrete,\u201d said Glock. \u201cThe market is failing us because it doesn\u2019t incorporate the price of environmental destruction.\u201d\nThe UK, for example, continues to produce vast amounts of virgin concrete each year. Recycled aggregate makes up less than a third of new-builds.\n\u201cTo increase how much new build uses recycled aggregates, we can only build less,\u201d said Andrew Minson, sustainable construction director at the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA). \u201cYou can hardly expect an industry of its own volition to decide to produce less if the rest of society isn\u2019t giving two hoots about sustainability.\u201d\nTo Minson, the biggest priority in the developed world is ensuring that concrete structures are not unnecessarily demolished, but reused and repurposed.\nConstruction and engineering specialists are more moderate in their approach to concrete than you might believe. Although they tend to share an appreciation for all that concrete has allowed humanity to achieve \u2013 frequently pointing out that the modern city would be unthinkable without it \u2013 they are, nonetheless, fairly unified in the view that we need to be using much less of it. Particularly virgin concrete.\nThey agree, too, that this cannot happen without oversight: fines for dumping concrete waste, stronger regulation around recycled aggregate in new builds, and high quality waste management facilities.\nMeanwhile, recycled concrete needs a new PR push, to convince the sceptics \u2013 and to give rubble a new name.\nThis article was amended on 1 March 2019 to add more context to a quotation from Andrew Minson\nThis article was amended on 5 March 2019 to clarify the involvement of SelFrag equipment during the experiments into concrete fragmentation by the Concrete Technology Group\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

It was reported later that a source in Corbyn\u2019s office claimed Thornberry had \u201cmisspoke\u201d during the interview.\nShe dismissed this as \u201cnonsense\u201d and was backed by Starmer on Tuesday.\nI've seen some nonsense that I \"misspoke\" earlier on a public vote. Pretty hard to misspeak identically in 10 interviews, but for clarity:\u00a0if Theresa May won't accept our deal, then the public must decide: do we accept whatever deal she gets through, or do we Remain? Got it?\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who said what. What I do know is that you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night setting out what the position is that we agreed as the Labour party.\u201d\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Starmer added: \u201cI\u2019m telling you what was in the official briefing from my office and Jeremy\u2019s office to Labour MPs last night. So there is no question that it should be between a credible leave option and remain.\u201d\nStarmer said he would back remain in a second vote, but was more cautious than Thornberry about Corbyn\u2019s stance.\n\u201cI would vote for remain. Jeremy will obviously speak for himself, but he voted remain last time and he like me has attacked the prime minister\u2019s deal uphill and down dale,\u201d he said.\nStarmer said Labour could not guarantee backing a second referendum until the party had tried to win support for its own soft Brexit alternative to May\u2019s deal.\n\u201cWe will put that proposition up for a vote on a customs union and single market alignment this week. If it doesn\u2019t go through, we the Labour party will either put down ourselves or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to protect us against what will be a damaging Tory Brexit, or even worse, no deal,\u201d he said.\nThe Labour MP John Mann warned Corbyn risked being ditched by voters over the party\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d shift to support a second referendum.\n\u201cVoters won\u2019t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg. It didn\u2019t end very well for him on tuition fees,\u201d he told Today.\n\u201cOur manifesto was unambiguous \u2013 we would accept the result of the referendum. A second referendum doesn\u2019t do that and the voters \u2013 in very, very large numbers \u2013 will not accept that.\u201d\nAsked about opposition to a second referendum within Labour, Starmer said: \u201cI am well aware of different views across my own party and across parliament on pretty well all Brexit issues.\u201d",

He said the carmaker had made \u201c0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019\u201d. Hours later he tweeted again to correct the figure. \u201cMeant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k,\u201d he tweeted.\nThe SEC said Musk had \u201cdid not seek or receive pre-approval prior to publishing this tweet, which was inaccurate and disseminated to over 24 million people\u201d. Under the terms of a deal agreed with the regulator in October, all of Musk\u2019s public communication \u2013 including tweets \u2013 must be approved by Tesla\u2019s lawyers in advance.\nTesla conceded that Musk did not receive pre-approval for the tweets, but said that he did not need to as the statements were based on information the company made public weeks earlier in an earnings call with analysts. The company said its lawyer monitors Musk\u2019s Twitter account and saw the 19 February tweet, and met with Musk at the Tesla factory to draft a tweet to clarify the original one.\nMusk tweeted on Monday night that the SEC \u201cforgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing \u2026\u201d\nSEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing \u2026 \ud83e\udd17\nThe case is likely to lead to a court hearing, in which a judge will consider whether Musk\u2019s tweets breach the terms of the earlier settlement, and if it did what punishment should be meted out. The SEC declined to comment on what sort of additional punishment Musk might face.\nThe SEC first took action against Musk for tweets in August 2018, in which he surprised investors by saying he was thinking about taking Tesla private, and had secured funding which would value the company at $420 a share. Tesla\u2019s shares soared immediately on the news, but it turned out that the flotation plans were at a much earlier stage than Musk\u2019s tweets had suggested. Musk denied wrongdoing, but agreed to stand down as Tesla\u2019s chairman. Both Musk and Tesla were fined $20m.\nSince agreeing the settlement, Musk has repeatedly mocked the SEC. In a tweet in October he called the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d. In December he told CBS that no one at the company was approving his tweets despite the settlement, and said:\u201cI want to be clear, I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.\u201d\nOn Tuesday he criticised the SEC for pursuing him, responding to a commentator who said it was the regulator\u2019s announcement that had moved the market, not him.\nExactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.",

        "content": "Forager and horticulturist Dave Hamilton on training your brain to recognise wild food\nIn squirrels, the hippocampus \u2013 the part of the brain that deals with long term and spatial memory \u2013 is very active. This helps them find the hazelnuts in spring that they buried months before, in the autumn. In London cabbies, this organ is much larger than it is in the rest of the population; it swells as they learn \u201cThe Knowledge\u201d they need to get around the capital.\nPrior to driving taxies, the hippocampus helped us find food and avoid trouble. With it, we could remember the best fishing spots, the location of edible tubers and avoid the cave of a hibernating bear.\nNowadays with sat navs and smartphones, we don\u2019t need to rely on the hippocampus quite so much. We can look up the nearest caf\u00e9 or supermarket and simply follow our phones to it. There aren\u2019t many cave bears on the M25, but the right phone app will help us to avoid the worst of the traffic by offering an alternative route.\nAll might seem lost for this ancient part of the brain. Yet it isn\u2019t hard to exercise the hippocampus and foraging does this in the way it actually evolved to work. Next time you are out on a familiar walk \u2013 be it in the city, town or countryside \u2013 look out for any edible plants on the route. Find the stand of nettles, the clump of wild garlic, or the spring blossom in anticipation of the fruit in the late summer or autumn.\nIt might at first be that you only know a handful of food plants, but your foraging knowledge can be expanded with a wild food guide book or by attending a wild food masterclass. Soon you will find that route will take on a different context. The way to work could be down a bramble patch road, past the cherry cut-through before crossing the road by the sour apple tree. Now try it somewhere less familiar, learning the landscape by its edible plants. Follow the elder, sloe and dog rose of the hedgerow, walk by the bulrush, meadowsweet and water mint of the riverside, and pass by the mushrooms and burdock of the woodland. It\u2019s amazing how differently you start to see the landscape and how your route takes on a whole new light.\nA few years ago, I was on a country walk with my eldest son, who was then too young to talk. As we wandered, we munched on hawthorn leaves, which are only edible as they emerge in the spring. The following year, by chance, we found ourselves walking down the same lane. Now, with a bit more vocabulary, he pointed to the hawthorn leaves and said, \u201cDaddy, eat?\u201d I was staggered. Not only could he remember the leaves themselves \u2013 but also the exact location in which we ate them the previous year. This seemed to suggest the link between plants and place may be something we are born with. With a little bit of training, we can re-awaken this ancient skill and see the landscape in the same way as our distant ancestors.\nDave will be leading our masterclass in foraging and preparing wild food, on Saturday 11 May.

An overall increase of 11.1%, this represents the first upward movement since 2014 \u2013 but still is the second lowest ever audience figure. Conversely, the Oscars remains the most watched non-sport live event on US TV.\nThe ratings hike will come as good news for the beleaguered Academy management, who had come under increasing criticism for a series of disastrously received proposals to try and invigorate the show and prevent its audience decline. Its chosen host, Kevin Hart, stepped down after an outcry over perceived homophobic comments and tweets; a proposal for a best popular film Oscar was dropped after widespread ridicule; a plan to drop performances of three of the five Oscar-nominated songs had to be cancelled, a suggestion that presentations by last year\u2019s acting winners be ditched in favour of more attention-grabbing names was swiftly reversed, as was the idea of non-live presentations for certain categories.\nIn the event, the inclusion of more commercially appealing elements \u2013 such as a performance by rock band Queen that opened the show, and the presence of \u201cpopular\u201d films such as Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book in the climatic awards handouts, appear to have helped the telecast improve its ratings \u2013 even if it didn\u2019t quite manage to keep the running time down to the promised three hours, finally clocking in 20 minutes over.",

But Thistlecrack and Elegant Escape, on their given day, have a great chance in the race. To have three lovely staying chasers rated in the high 160s is everything you want. Five fences from the finish in the King George, you thought [Native River] was going to be pulled up, but then he stayed on really strongly and, if the race had been another couple of furlongs, he could have been right up with them at the finishing line. Elegant Escape is a younger horse and he is still improving with every start. His last run was his highest-rated performance. Thistlecrack ran well in the King George and got close to [the winner] Clan Des Obeaux. I think he has as much of a chance as anything else in the race. He is 11 years old, but he has been lightly raced in recent seasons.\nVision Des Flos (Champion Hurdle): He won the National Spirit Hurdle nicely at Fontwell [on Sunday]. He is a lovely horse and if he had not unseated his rider on his first chase start earlier this season, then I think we would have gone chasing for the rest of the year. We wouldn\u2019t be afraid to go for the Champion Hurdle with him [but] he is also entered in the Coral Cup, it\u2019s something we don\u2019t need to decide today.\nFox Norton (Champion Chase or Ryanair Chase): He\u2019s slipping under the radar a little bit. I thought he ran a lovely race at Ascot in the Ascot Chase. I think the Ryanair Chase is the plan at the moment.\nWest Approach & Kilbricken Storm (Stayers\u2019 Hurdle): West Approach is a decent horse and has finished second to [Stayer\u2019s Hurdle favourite] Paisley Park the last twice. We will sit on the tail of Paisley Park this time around, if we could cover him up a bit then he would have a good chance. Kilbricken Storm is a bit of a forgotten horse. He was very good [working] with Elixir De Nutz, Master Debonair and Native River at Wincanton last week. He finished right upsides them and was brilliant.\nElixir Du Nutz (Supreme Novice Hurdle): He was absolutely brilliant in a gallop at Wincanton last week. We could have another little away day, but we might leave him be as he looks very fit. His form stands up to anybody else\u2019s in the Supreme.\nLostintranslation (RSA Chase): He is just a lovely horse and he also has winning form round Cheltenham and the track will suit him. Whatever he does this year, I see him as a Gold Cup horse for next year.\nMister Malarky (RSA Chase or National Hunt Chase): He has been a revelation over fences and is rated 148 so he is good enough to run in any of the big novice chases at Cheltenham, including the RSA.\nMaster Debonair (Champion Bumper): He has won two of his three bumpers and did it well at Cheltenham last time. He has won on autumn ground at Cheltenham, but spring ground will be fine. He is not a big horse and has form in the bag \u2013 whether it is good enough is anyone\u2019s guess. Hopefully, we will aim for the Supreme with him next year, he\u2019s a good horse.\nCuddles McGraw (2.30) has plenty to recommend him at around 7-2 in the novice handicap chase at Leicester. Fergal O\u2019Brien\u2019s chaser got off the mark over fences at the second attempt at Warwick last time and recorded a good time in the process.\nAll Is Good (3.30) travelled well for a long way when returning from a four-month break at Huntingdon last time before finishing less than four lengths behind the winner. He should show the benefit of that run when he lines up off the same mark, while It\u2019s All About Me (4.50) is another with an obvious chance on the card at Catterick Bridge.\nMartineo was back to his best at Wolverhampton last time out but whether he should be a 15-8 chance to follow up today is a different question and the veteran Lucky Lodge (6.00) looks overpriced at around 7-1 to register a seventh course success.\nLeicester\u00a02.00 Northern Beau\u00a02.30 Cuddles McGraw\u00a03.00 The Last But One\u00a03.30 All Is Good\u00a04.00 Midnight Mustang\u00a04.30 Brave Jaq\u00a0\u00a0Ffos Las\u00a02.10 Urtheonethatiwant\u00a02.40 Top And Drop\u00a03.10 Baratineur\u00a03.40 Khage\u00a04.10 Gone Platinum\u00a04.40 King Roland\u00a0Catterick\u00a02.20 Trapper Peak\u00a02.50 Dagian\u00a03.20 Louis' Vac Pouch\u00a03.50 Shaman Du Berlais\u00a04.20 Fifty Shades\u00a04.50 It's All About Me (nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wolverhampton\u00a05.00 Sharp Operator\u00a05.30 Bay Of Naples\u00a06.00 Lucky Lodge (nap)\u00a06.30 Juanito Chico\u00a07.00 Ulster\u00a07.30 Vin D'Honneur",

The withdrawals are set to occur in three ports, including the key Red Sea port of Hodeidah.\nThe summit comes after reports that delays to scheduled withdrawals of Houthi troops had led to clashes between the two sides in southern Hodeidah, something that would represent a setback to the Stockholm agreement.\nThe UN says about 20 million people need help to secure food this year in Yemen, including nearly 10 million who are just a step away from famine. Nearly 240,000 are facing \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d, it says.\nLast week Mark Lowcock, the UN coordinator for humanitarian relief, told the UN security council: \u201cAmong the many challenges the aid operation faces, funding is quickly becoming the biggest. We expect current resources to be used up by the end of March \u2013 just six weeks from now\u201d. More than 250 humanitarian organisations are operating in the country.\nBritain\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) announced at the weekend it would provide a further \u00a3200m in 2019, taking its total aid donations to \u00a3800m since the civil war started.\nBut it is calculated that in 2018 nearly 60% of the aid to alleviate suffering in Yemen came from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US, the three countries most active in helping the UN-recognised government of Yemen to defeat an Iranian-supported insurgency run by the Houthis.\nThey are likely to be the dominant donors again this year, highlighting the paradox that those leading the aerial bombing campaign are doing most to alleviate some of its consequences.\nIn a statement ahead of the Geneva conference, Unicef\u2019s Middle East and North Africa director, Geert Cappelaere, said: \u201cNot enough has changed for children in Yemen since the Stockholm agreement on 13 December 2018. Every day since, eight children have been killed or injured. Most of the children killed were playing outdoors with their friends or were on their way to or from school.\n\u201cMind-boggling violence over the past four years, high levels of poverty; and decades of conflicts, neglect and deprivation are putting a heavy strain on Yemeni society, tearing apart its social fabric \u2013 fundamental for any society and especially for children.\u201d\nJan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said: \u201cYemenis need much more than just money. They need an end to interference in aid delivery, a lifting of the blockade, all ports and airports reopened, public services restored, and a nationwide ceasefire so that talks can bring an end to the conflict.\u201d\nYemen\u2019s prime minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed said on Monday that his government was appealing to the international community for support in achieving a just and comprehensive peace.\n\u201cThe war in Yemen will not end until the Houthis are defeated, we hope that the humanitarian agencies will deal impartially with the situation in the country,\u201d Saeed said during a meeting in Geneva ahead of the donor conference.",

        "content": "The US military doesn\u2019t provide plant-based meals, often leaving vegan service members to rely on snacks \u2013 but some are seeing a rise in like-minded comrades\nJohn, a specialist in the US army, went vegan in 2018 while deployed in the Middle East after he started practicing Buddhism.\n\u201cI\u2019m living in a world of violence by being in the military but trying to live the most peaceful lifestyle that I can,\u201d John says. \u201cChoosing not to be violent in my everyday life when I don\u2019t have to be is something I wholeheartedly say falls in line with my religious beliefs and military values.\u201d\nThe military will accommodate a kosher, halal and vegetarian diet for troops, but no meals ready to eat (MREs) \u2013 which deployed soldiers rely on for breakfast, lunch and dinner \u2013 are totally plant-based. Like other vegan soldiers, John often has to rely on snacks. He once spent a month eating just bread, crackers, peanut butter and canned vegetables.\n\u201cIt was just a miserable time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were in the field and had one meal a day. I went four days straight eating exclusively green beans.\u201d He was fatigued, an obvious problem for soldiers in combat. \u201cYou want soldiers to be at their most capable and their most mentally and physically prepared for any action,\u201d he says.\nJohn prefers not to use his real name because he is worried about further ostracizing himself.\nHe says he is often told he\u2019s not a man if he doesn\u2019t eat meat. \u201cSomeone told me that being vegan is against God and being vegan makes me weak,\u201d he recalls of an exchange while standing in line for a physical. Because the man who said it outranked him, John didn\u2019t argue.\n\u201cPart of being vegan in the military is learning that there are some conversations that aren\u2019t even worth having with people,\u201d he says with a sigh. \u201cI get a lot of shit for it.\u201d\nWhile the number of vegans in the military has never been officially determined, John isn\u2019t alone. Anecdotally, vegan service members I spoke with report a rise in like-minded comrades, one that reflects a larger social trend: in 2017, there were five times as many vegans in America as in 2014. Part of the problem in making the case for vegan MREs as well as more plant-based options in military dining facilities is that no hard data on the number of vegans soldiers exists. Both the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the army public affairs office declined to comment on whether they have plans to evaluate how many service members either require or are interested in plant-based options.\nThe DLA, a federal agency that decides what goes in MREs, confirmed that currently no MREs are vegan but declined to explain why or say whether the military would consider changing this. \u201cThere may have been a vegetarian entree that was also vegan. To date, there has been no military service requirement for vegan MREs,\u201d the DLA commented via email which also verified that four of the 24 MRE options are vegetarian.\nA couple of weeks ago, a dining hall in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, became the first to offer a plant-based entree at every meal, thanks to the ongoing advocacy of one vegan soldier.\nBut at all other dining halls, service members have to put in requests for a plant-based option, though there\u2019s no requirement for those requests to be fulfilled. Junior service members may not know it\u2019s within their rights to make such a request in the first place. If they do know, they may not want to further differentiate themselves by making a special request, instead choosing to get by the occasional plant-based entree or sides of vegetables \u2013 though vegan service members say those are often cooked in butter \u2013 or the salad bar, if they\u2019re lucky enough to have one.\n\u201cTwo years ago, if you were to say the word \u2018vegan\u2019 to me, I would\u2019ve told you to not bother talking to me about it,\u201d Chief Petty Officer Thomas Shearin, a mechanic in the US Coast Guard stationed in Miami, says. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to recruit me. I didn\u2019t climb to the top of the food chain to eat rabbit food.\n\u201cGrowing up in Texas, if you ate tofu instead of barbecue chicken, you definitely didn\u2019t grow up playing football,\u201d Shearin says. Now, he no longer equates meat with masculinity and proudly makes his own seitan at home. Most significantly, and to his own surprise, his veganism has become about more than addressing his lack of energy, high blood pressure and fear of reaching the military\u2019s maximum weight limit. In less than two years, he says it has also become an ethical stance for the environment and animals.\nShearin went vegan while stationed in Saudi Arabia, where he met Master Chief Petty Officer Eric Gibson, who has been vegan for more than five years \u2013 initially to appease his animal rights-minded wife before going \u201cfull vegan\u201d to manage his health.\nWhile both Shearin and Gibson say the transition has been doable for them in the Coast Guard, they note that their high rank and not being deployed helps. Unlike John, they don\u2019t have to rely on MREs for food and rank high enough to feel comfortable asking dining facilities to provide a vegan option. They are more likely to be accommodated because of their rank.\nInterestingly, the military already has prepackaged vegan meals; they\u2019re just not for soldiers. A DLA spokesperson confirmed that while some meals distributed as humanitarian aid to civilians are not classified as vegan, \u201cthese meals contain no animal products or by-products, except that minimal amounts of dairy products are permitted.\u201d Having vegan meals as humanitarian aid makes sense \u2013 plant-based food is more easily made halal, can be less perishable and may be less expensive.\nIndeed, in California, where a new law gave incarcerated people the right to request plant-based meals, legislative analysis found that the vegan options might be cheaper than traditional prison food, saving the state money in the long term. Although the law is new, it means that California inmates, whether they identify as vegan or not, now have more access to plant-based food than US service members.\nFinancial incentives may be at play in the military as well. Gibson says he thinks a lot of the military\u2019s decisions are linked to industries the government subsidizes, like dairy and meat. This is just one more hurdle, but it seems soldiers continue to look for plant-based alternatives. John says fellow service members now frequently tell him they met another vegan soldier that day \u2013 something he almost never heard four years ago.\nShearin has experienced this change too: \u201cIt seems like every unit that I go to and visit, I come across people that are vegan, or who want to go vegan and they\u2019re just not sure how to do it.\u201d He encourages them to try a one-month vegan challenge and tells them if he can go plant-based, anyone can.\n\u201cMy view has changed,\u201d Shearin says. \u201cWe have a responsibility to the planet we\u2019re on right now. I tell people if they\u2019re vegan three days a week, that\u2019s three days a week that they\u2019re helping the planet. I would call that a win for them and for me.\u201d",

        "content": "Interest rates reach nearly 700% in some states as debate over how to regulate payday loans continues\nAsha Clark doesn\u2019t have any savings. She works full-time. She earns a minimum wage, making phone calls as a customer service representative. In Las Vegas, Nevada, where she lives, that\u2019s $8.25 an hour. Sometimes, her paycheck isn\u2019t enough to cover all her bills. Those are times that Clark would take out a payday loan.\nIn Nevada, there are more payday lenders than Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s restaurants combined. They provide short-term loans that are meant to be repaid in full when the borrower gets their next paycheck. Each loan comes with fees \u2013 for example, about $75 in fees for a $500 loan. The trouble is that when borrowers like Clark get their check and spend most of it repaying the loan, they end up short on cash again. And so they take out another payday loan. Next payday, the same thing happens. The borrowers roll over that same $500 loan every two weeks, each time paying the fee. Over the span of the year, the fees alone can be as much as seven times the size of the original loan.\nIt\u2019s those fees that got Clark in trouble. The payday lender was automatically deducting the fees from her checking account every two weeks, but the money wasn\u2019t there. That triggered overdraft fees.\n\u201cThen they tried to run it again and then you get another overdraft fee and then the remaining checks bounced,\u201d said Clark. \u201cSo I had to close the bank account down \u2026 and stop paying the loan altogether.\u201d\nNow Clark, 39, is without a checking account, has bad credit and doesn\u2019t qualify for a credit card. All she has is a prepaid debit card.\nBack in 2016, scenarios like this led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to propose a rule that would require payday lenders to find out if their customers had future income to pay off the loan. Under that rule, lenders would have to notify the borrowers before first attempting to take money out of their checking accounts. And if the money wasn\u2019t in the account, they would only be allowed to make two consecutive attempts to withdraw the money before having to get permission for more withdrawal attempts. Also, borrowers who took out three loans in a short period of time would be required to go through a 30-day \u201ccooling-off period\u201d before being able to take out another loan.\nThe rule never ended up going into effect, delayed by Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Now, parts of the rule are being rolled back by the recently confirmed CFPB director, Kathy Kraninger.\nThe partial rollback of the proposed rule was welcomed by the lender community. And according to a statement issued by the Community Financial Services Association of America, they are still pushing for a complete rollback.\nPayday lenders don\u2019t appreciate being cast as preying on borrowers and often defend the high interest rates they charge. Their argument is that they are filling a hole in the market, loaning money to those who can\u2019t get it through traditional channels. And since those borrowers tend to be riskier, their loans have to come with higher interest rates or fees.\nRecently, the Center for Responsible Lending tracked how much borrowers end up paying in fees and found that in some states, interest rates on payday loans reached nearly 700%. In Texas, borrowers paid on average 662%. In Nevada, that number was 652%, and in Kansas 391%.\nThe proposed rule was expected to bring those numbers down.\n\u201cWhen the rule was finalized, in November of 2017, we estimated that it would save Texans over $400m compared to current market practices, by limiting refinances and ensuring more affordable loans,\u201d said Ann Baddour, director of fair financial services at Texas Appleseed, a public interest justice center.\nWhile the debate over how to regulate payday loans continues in Washington DC, states are taking the matters into their own hands. Some have banned payday loans while others have capped annual interest states.\nThe same day that the CFPB announced rollback of the proposed payday loans regulations, Nevada lawmakers introduced Assembly Bill 118, which would cap payday loan interest rates at 36% a year.\nWhile borrowers welcome regulation of payday loans, they wish that lawmakers would also try to come up with alternative loan solutions.\nFor years, Jennifer Ladd used to take out $500 payday loans and pay the $75 in fees every two weeks. Then one day, an emergency struck and she needed more money than that.\n\u201cI saw on TV this ad: \u2018Call this number! You will qualify!\u2019 And sure enough I got suckered into it,\u201d said Ladd, 42, who lives in Kansas and works as a paramedic.\nFor about two years, she kept making payments each month and felt like she was getting nowhere.\n\u201cI went to my bank and got a personal loan from them to pay that loan off,\u201d said Ladd. \u201cI was like: \u2018I can\u2019t keep paying $800 a month per loan.\u2019 Fortunately they were like: \u2018Absolutely, let\u2019s help you get you out of this.\u2019\u201d\nHer bank helped her pay down the loan and also shut down her checking account, but not before the payday lender tried to convince them to keep it open. In the end, Ladd said she paid about 250% interest on that loan.\nAccording to Ladd, the best thing lawmakers could do is to raise wages. \u201cBottom line is wages have to go up,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are not getting paid enough.\u201d In Kansas, minimum wage is $7.25 \u2013 same as the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck there since July 2009.\nClark, who earns a minimum wage in Las Vegas, says: \u201cThat\u2019s not enough to have a decent living. You definitely need a second income or some type of support system to be able to live and survive.\u201d But she has no second income, no savings and is just one emergency away from finding herself in need of cash.\nWhen asked if she would take out another payday loans, Clark hesitated.\n\u201cI want to say no, I wouldn\u2019t get one, because like I said, the interest rate is too high and then in the future, it messes up your credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes on your credit report. It can be reported to a collection agency if you still end up owing. So now I would say no but who knows what the near future would bring.\u201d\nBut if she found herself in real financial hardship again, she said there is a good chance she would do it anyway. The high interest rates weren\u2019t enough to deter her last time, either.\n\u201cAt the time, I was facing homelessness,\u201d said Clark. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a job, the rent was due and I had a five-day\u2019s notice. I was trying to save my apartment \u2026 So, at that time I wasn\u2019t concerned about the interest rate.\u201d",

        "content": "Bezos, who holds Amazon stock valued at about $137bn, contributed a total of $2bn in 2018\nJeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man and one frequently tagged a cheapskate when it comes to giving away money, has emerged as a leading philanthropist.\nAccording to the latest Philanthropy 50 list, a ranking of America\u2019s top 50 donors compiled by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Bezos actually made more charitable donations than anyone else in the US last year, including philanthropists with comparable fortunes such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates.\nBezos, who holds Amazon stock valued at about $137bn, contributed a total of $2bn to good causes in 2018 through his Bezos Day One Fund, a philanthropic vehicle founded by his soon-to-be ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos.\nAccording to the foundation\u2019s website, the Bezos fund was established to support existing not-for-profits addressing homelessness and poverty, in addition to funding preschool education in low-income communities.\nWhile the Bezos gifts may still be far behind Gates\u2019 lifetime donations of about $45bn to global poverty alleviation and education, or Bloomberg\u2019s current $6bn in gifts, his surprise entry into the top 50 comes as overall giving among the group declined by half last year compared to 2017.\nAccording to the Chronicle\u2019s annual list the people who gave the most to charity contributed a total of more than $7.8bn last year, a steep drop from the $14.7bn a year earlier.\nIn order of magnitude, the Bezos\u2019s $2bn came in easily ahead of Bloomberg, who gave $767m to the arts, education, the environment, health and other causes; and at No 3, Pierre and Pam Omidyar, whose fortune derives from eBay, who contributed $392m to not-for-profits that seek to promote democracy, citizen activism and other causes.\nThe Omidyars handily beat out Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, who came in at No 7 with gifts totaling $213m to various causes.\nOther newcomers to the list include Craigslist founder Craig Newmark at No 11, who donated $144m, largely to not-for-profits that produce news and journalism.\nAccording to the publication, the 2018 list is notable for donations directed toward artificial intelligence or other tech advances. One of the principal donors to that field is Wall Street fund manager Stephen Schwarzman, who at No 4 gave $350m to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for artificial intelligence studies.\nStill the focus of the latest list is likely to remain on Bezos, whose entry onto the charts comes after years of making no impression whatsoever.\nBezos has previously said he intends to plough his entire fortune into his Texas-based space operation Blue Origin, explaining: \u201cWe have to go to space to save earth, and we kind of have to hurry.\u201d\nBut with an impending divorce that could siphon off half of his fortune, the scale of that plan could be facing reductions.\nBezos\u2019s $2bn gift may help to quell persistent grumblings about his slow philanthropic uptake. In 2017, Bezos responded and solicited ideas on Twitter for long-term philanthropic causes, receiving over 49,000 comments.\nBezos later said the responses, which trended to affordable housing, environmental protection and workers\u2019 rights, had been \u201cvery helpful and have already changed my thinking about how to approach this\u201d.\nBezos\u2019 gift, which amounts to a 2% tax on his fortune, comes as Amazon corporate tax structure comes under increasing scrutiny. The company has been profitable only over the last two years and only - relative to revenue - to a marginal $11 billion last year, yet the company paid $0 in corporate income tax last year, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\nYet investors have been willing to pay for Amazon shares at an extreme multiple of earnings in the hope it will someday return higher earnings. That hope, and canny tax structuring, is the basis of Bezos\u2019 richest-man status and in part why his gift-giving \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 comes under persistent scrutiny.\nBezos\u2019 charitable donation will also refocus attention on his personal tax status.\n  Last month historian Rutger Bregman made a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos during which he accused wealthy participants at the meeting of avoiding higher taxes. Societies should not rely on the generosity of the rich, Bregman said, adding: \u201cPhilanthropy is not a substitute for democracy, or proper taxation, or a good welfare state.\u201d",

        "content": "There was strong competition, but Sunday\u2019s ceremony provided one epic, multi-vehicular pileup\nSunday\u2019s Oscars had an awful lot going on. While some of the big events \u2013 such as Olivia Colman\u2019s speech, Green Book\u2019s contentious win and the Cooper/Gaga facerub \u2013 received the attention they deserved, a handful of smaller, bizarre moments got lost in the cracks.\nIt is my opinion that these moments also deserve their time in the sun, which is why I am here to laud one such instance: the flaming multi-vehicular pileup that was Vice\u2019s Oscar win for best makeup and hairstyling.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t to say that Vice did not deserve to win an Oscar. Of course it did. The transformation of every single actor who appeared in Vice was both amazing and total. However, I cannot believe that anyone involved in the makeup and hairstyling on Vice realised this, because their acceptance speech was genuinely one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t prepared. It was as if they\u2019d been deliberately placed in an isolation chamber since birth and didn\u2019t even understand the concept of what an acceptance speech was.\nFirst, some context. The Oscars this year were surprisingly brisk, and nowhere was this more apparent than with the speeches. The speech that directly preceded Vice\u2019s \u2013 the best documentary win for Free Solo \u2013 was played off almost instantly. Perhaps this made Vice\u2019s hair and makeup team jumpy. Perhaps they were already jumpy. But, even if they were, it still doesn\u2019t fully explain what happened next.\nThe winners \u2013 Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney \u2013 staggered on to the stage. Cannom immediately started thanking people, before he noticed his two female colleagues standing beside him. One of them, Biscoe, unfolded a sheet of A4 paper and held it landscape. Landscape, for crying out loud. Nobody writes landscape on a sheet of A4. The only people in history ever to use A4 landscape are kidnappers writing ransom notes, and even then I suspect it feels a bit weird for them.\nBiscoe pointed at part of the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d she told Cannom. \u201cRead that.\u201d Cannom non-committally stuttered a couple of words, before Biscoe barged in and just read it out herself. At this point, all bets were off. Dehaney \u2013 easily a foot shorter than her companions \u2013 kept trying to dive between them to say her piece, before chickening out and backing away. In the end, she had to crane in past Biscoe.\nBiscoe held out her sheet for Dehaney to read from, but in an act of pure spiteful rebellion, Dehaney revealed that she had brought her own acceptance speech, written on her own piece of paper. The three of them kept starting the same sentences at the same time, hitting an awkward bottleneck that more often than not had to resolve itself when Cannom backed out with a gracious \u201cGo ahead\u201d.\nAfter 60 seconds, the play-off music struck up. But this didn\u2019t deter our three winners from this majestic piece of avant garde performance art; they kept thanking people, sometimes whispering names to themselves like naughty little woodland elves before gaining the confidence to say them out loud.\nAnother 15 seconds passed, and the camera cut away from them. Their microphone was switched off, but still they stood there wordlessly thanking people. This went on for another 10 agonising seconds before, finally, someone did the humane thing and cut the stage\u2019s lights. Then, and only then, did the speech end.\nThere were other odd speeches on Sunday. My second favourite was the speech for best live action short for Skin, which began as a solemn address about the bigotry that led to the Holocaust before whiplashing into a detonation of mad-eyed, jazz-handed, room-shaking, all-caps, we-did-it WHOOPING.\nBut it paled in comparison to the Vice win, which might well be the most excruciating thing I\u2019ll ever see. It was like watching an implosion. And, honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Because, on a night of over-rehearsed slickness, this was a cold bucket of reality. If you or I ever had to give an acceptance speech at the Oscars, in front of the entire world, we\u2019d shrivel up in exactly the same way. We\u2019d whisper and stammer and yell. We\u2019d get shut off in the most brutal way imaginable, too. So here\u2019s to Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney. They are all of us. May they never be forgotten.",

        "content": "\u201cIt is curious,\u201d Neville Cardus wrote in this newspaper in December 1928, \u201chow the sense of style and class will make itself felt even through a cable read thousands of miles from the spot.\u201d\nThis, in the end, is perhaps the most important job of the cricket writer, and what makes reporting more than the mere reproduction of scores and statistics with the occasional added adjective. The reader\u2019s ability to judge a player has been rendered significantly easier since Cardus\u2019s time by the advent of, well, almost everything we now use to watch and learn about cricket except paper, ink and eyes. Still, the writer\u2019s job continues to be done, and with a bit of luck the sense of style and class continues to make itself felt.\nWhen just last month Vic Marks used a few broad brushstrokes to describe \u201ca young batsman who commands attention \u2026 a left-hander who has a bit of swagger and likes to hit the ball\u201d, it was the first time the play of Shimron Hetmyer had been described for the Guardian reader. Watching and reading about England\u2019s tour of the West Indies the picture of a 22-year-old of considerable style and promise has continued to fill out, as Hetmyer has blossomed into everyone\u2019s new favourite batsman.\nCardus was writing about one of them when he penned the above statement in 1928, a player who at that point he had never witnessed. As it happens the first time Don Bradman was mentioned by the Guardian had been that January, in a report on a Sheffield Shield match between Queensland and New South Wales, when we described him as \u201ca medium-pace bowler\u201d who \u201ckept a good length\u201d. As with Hetmyer, who has already been a Test cricketer for nearly two years, it took an England tour for a fuller picture to emerge.\nIn a warm-up game against NSW in November 1928 Bradman was \u201ca brilliant young colt\u201d who \u201cbatted splendidly\u201d with \u201can easy style\u201d. The hyperbole grew further following a century on debut in the first Test, and by the time Cardus got a chance to see Bradman at first hand, when Australia arrived in England in 1930, the 21-year-old was already considered among the world\u2019s finest players. \u201cThe genius of this remarkable boy consists in the complete summary he gives us of the technique of batsmanship,\u201d Cardus wrote that summer. \u201cThe really astonishing fact about Bradman is that a boy should play as he does, with the sophistication of an old hand and brain. How came this Bradman to expel from him all the greenness and impetuosity of youth while retaining the strength and alacrity of youth?\u201d\nBradman wasn\u2019t the last great batsman whom the Guardian initially considered a bowler. In 1954 we wrote about \u201can 18-year-old left-arm slow bowler from Barbados\u201d (actually 17) by the name of Garfield Sobers. It took three more years, and a century against MCC at Lord\u2019s, before we got excited about his batsmanship, Denys Rowbotham writing that he was \u201cclearly a man who loves to hit hard and often\u201d, while \u201cagainst all the slow bowlers he used his feet as feet should be used\u201d.\nIt can be irresistibly tempting to bestow greatness upon players who are simply very promising. Phil Tufnell used to say that Ed Joyce was the best young batsman he had ever seen, an honour Bob Cottam, Somerset\u2019s director of cricket, bestowed on the wildly hyped Mark Lathwell in 1993: \u201cHe has immense talent and it\u2019s incredible the way he takes everything in his stride.\u201d The Evening Standard once gave its best young cricketer award to a callow 13-year-old by the name of John Major. \u201cHe\u2019s a superb player, the best young player in the country. I see a lot of Tendulkar in him,\u201d said Justin Langer in 2007, of Ravi Bopara.\nAll of these descriptions turned out to be a little overenthusiastic, though observers have also sometimes failed to get excited enough. In May 1974 we sent John Arlott to watch a county match between Somerset and Lancashire, where a youngster was given his first-class debut. \u201cBotham, in his first match, made a pleasant impression,\u201d he deadpanned. The following month Henry Blofeld saw the same player hit 45 not out for Somerset against Hampshire in the Benson & Hedges Cup. \u201cIan Botham, a young man of 18 from Yeovil, played not only the innings of his life, but he also lifted the game from a state of conventional excitement to one of unbelievable suspense and drama and finally into the realms of romantic fiction,\u201d he drooled. There were, it turned out, other innings-of-his-life to come.\nLooking back, it is possible to appreciate those occasions when, even the first time writers have seen a young player, they have managed to convey a little of the magic to come. Tendulkar himself was first mentioned by Mike Selvey in 1989, when he played for an Air India XI against England. \u201cThe young batters were mighty impressive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTendulkar [is] a Gavaskar clone in mannerisms, dirty pads and, it is said, ability.\u201d Fifteen years earlier, after seeing a game between an England XI and the Leeward Islands in Antigua, Blofeld had heralded \u201ca dramatically exciting stroke player\u201d by the name of Vivian Richards. \u201cLike all good players Richards has that extra split second in which to play his strokes and his footwork is good. He has an exciting array of strokes without the experience to know when not to use them.\u201d When we first wrote about a 21-year-old Richard Hadlee in May 1973, Michael Carey spotted that \u201chis splendid action will bear watching by connoisseurs and budding fast bowlers alike\u201d.\nWatching for the first time a young player who, if only in your mind and at that moment, could be destined for greatness is one of the genuine thrills of sport, one that can be rendered greater by their subsequent success but cannot be dimmed by disappointment. As ever Cardus transmitted this excitement flawlessly.\n\u201cHere was a great cricketer in the making,\u201d he wrote in June 1937 of Bill Edrich, the kind of player who could inspire others to take (and indeed build) a stand. \u201cA finer exhibition of resourceful batsmanship could not well be imagined. When the pitch was at its worst he executed his strokes according to the soundest principles, and his power when he did hit was impressive. He is a player far above ordinary good or high class; he is perhaps the finest young batsman of the day.\u201d\nAnd on that day, if not on any other, it was true.\n This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

        "content": "Tuesday\u2019s top story: Catholic church\u2019s third most senior cleric found guilty of child sexual abuse. Plus, predicting next year\u2019s Oscar nominees\nGood morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories.\nGeorge Pell, Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, was found guilty in December of five charges of child sexual abuse, in a verdict that was subject to a suppression order until this week and can now be reported. Pell was until recently the Vatican treasurer, the third most powerful cleric in Rome. His conviction for crimes committed during the 1990s, when he was archbishop of Melbourne, has thrown the church back into crisis just days after Pope Francis hosted a historic summit on clerical sexual abuse.\nThe victims. One of the men abused by Pell pleaded for anonymity in a statement describing his \u201cshame, loneliness, depression and struggle\u201d. The father of another victim, who died of a heroin overdose, has said he will sue Pell and the church.\nBrutal and dogmatic. The Guardian\u2019s David Marr, author of a book about Pell and the clerical sexual abuse scandal, says the cardinal made his career by being tough on sex, while swerving longstanding allegations about his own conduct.\nMohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister and lead negotiator on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, has unexpectedly submitted his resignation, dealing a victory to Tehran\u2019s hardliners \u2013 and a further blow to the deal, from which the US withdrew last year. Javad Zarif announced he was quitting in an Instagram post, citing an \u201cinability to continue to his service\u201d. It is unclear whether President Hassan Rouhani will accept his resignation, a decision that ultimately lies with Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei.\n\u2018Deadly poison\u2019. In an interview with an Iranian newspaper, Javad Zarif said the country\u2019s factional political infighting was a \u201cdeadly poison\u201d, implying he may have quit over hardline opposition to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal he negotiated.\nThe North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Un, has arrived in Vietnam after a three-day overland journey to Hanoi from Pyongyang (with a cigarette break), ahead of his second summit with Donald Trump. The two leaders are scheduled to have a one-on-one conversation and private dinner on Wednesday, followed by official meetings on Thursday. There is little expectation of a denuclearisation deal, though some hope the summit could end with a formal declaration that the 1950-53 Korean war is finally over.\nTrump tactics. The US negotiating position with North Korea is uncertain and confused, writes the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger. But military analyst William Arkin says Trump\u2019s strategy, such as it is, appears to be working.\nThe US vice-president, Mike Pence, repeated Trump\u2019s warning that \u201call options are on the table\u201d regarding the crisis in Venezuela during a meeting with the country\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, in Bogot\u00e1 on Monday. But despite Pence\u2019s insistence that \u201cthere can be no bystanders in Venezuela\u2019s struggle for freedom\u201d, some international allies have explicitly ruled out military options, leaving the US increasingly isolated in its willingness to use force to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nAid blocked. Guaid\u00f3 has urged the international community to \u201ckeep all options open\u201d after opposition efforts to bring foreign aid into Venezuela failed over the weekend.\nJorge Ramos. Univision has said its news anchor Jorge Ramos and his crew were temporarily detained and their equipment and footage confiscated after Ramos raised awkward questions in an interview with Maduro on Monday.\nIndia has launched an airstrike on a training camp in Kashmir run by the group responsible for a recent suicide attack on Indian forces, the first aerial bombing across the disputed border with Pakistan since the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.\nPaul Manafort is pleading with a judge for leniency as he faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. Manafort\u2019s lawyers said on Monday that his crimes related to the Trump-Russia investigation were merely \u201cgarden variety\u201d.\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK\u2019s leftwing Labour party, has said Labour will back a second Brexit referendum, assuming parliament rejects his party\u2019s proposals for an alternative Brexit deal this week.\nThe world\u2019s richest man, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, has finally become one of its most generous, appearing for the first time in the annual Philanthropy 50 list, a ranking of America\u2019s top 50 donors, after contributing $2bn to good causes in 2018.\nWho might be winning Oscars in 2020?\nWith a mere 12 months to go before next year\u2019s Academy Awards, Benjamin Lee assesses the early favourites, including Oscar veterans like Tom Hanks, Natalie Portman and Quentin Tarantino, and newcomers such as Zazie Beetz.\nHow concrete became the ultimate lifestyle concept\nMaligned for decades as the scourge of urban design, concrete is back in fashion. The Guardian\u2019s architecture critic Oliver Wainwright explains the grey stuff\u2019s growing popularity, and asks why we don\u2019t do more to preserve our existing brutalist structures.\nThe US soldiers fighting for vegan food\nThe US military will accommodate a kosher, halal and vegetarian diet for deployed troops, but vegans in the field are often forced to live on plant-based snacks. Rachel Krantz talks to some of the growing number of vegan servicemen.\nThe \u2018coyote lady\u2019 of San Francisco\nJanet Kessler came across her first coyote early one summer morning in 2007, on a hill in San Francisco, and has been besotted by the creatures ever since. With urban coyotes proliferating, writes Vivian Ho, coyote enthusiasts are becoming more common, too.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new abortion rules are designed to defund Planned Parenthood, says Moira Donegan. That will deprive many of America\u2019s most vulnerable low-income patients of crucial care.\nMoney that was earmarked to help women stay healthy and make independent, informed choices about their own bodies will now be given to organizations that have a track record of lying to women in order to constrain their choices.\nA film about Alex Honnold\u2019s incredible free solo ascent of El Capitan just won the Oscar for best documentary.

That could in turn lead to an inability on the part of councils \u201cto fulfil statutory duty to balance budgets\u201d, amounting to a warning that a collapse in the social care sector could have wide financial ramifications for local government.\nImpact on the NHS. The presentation says \u201cdisruption to adult social care is also likely to have knock-on effects on the NHS\u201d, including pressure on GP services, community healthcare and hospitals.\nThere are more than 16,000 independent social care providers in the UK, with small and medium-sized providers accounting for 75% of the market.\nThe presentation concludes: \u201cOur analysis of the adult social care provider sector is that it is already financially stretched and that cumulative impacts of a no-deal EU exit could lead to provider failures.\u201d\nBarbara Keeley, the shadow social care minister, said: \u201cThis is an extraordinary admission from the government that the catastrophic no-deal Brexit which this reckless prime minister is driving the country towards could endanger the lives of vulnerable people.\n\u201cThis irresponsible Tory government has bled the social care system dry over the last nine years through budget cuts, and this document shows that a calamitous no-deal Brexit could deliver a mortal blow to the system.\u201d\nIn November the sector regulator, the Care Quality Commission, wrote to dozens of local authorities to warn them elderly people could be at risk if a large provider, Allied Healthcare, failed. In the end, Allied was acquired by Castle Rock Group.\nAs a result, the Department of Health and Social Care held a contingency planning exercise on 19 February to test its response. Repeating the warnings, the document said that was because \u201cBrexit may cause multiple providers to fail simultaneously\u201d.\nA DHSC spokesperson said the government had to plan for a no deal scenario. \u201cWe are focused on ensuring people continue to receive high quality social care and are working across Government to help local authorities and the adult social care sector fully prepare for a no deal scenario.\u201d",

        "content": "Royal Opera House, LondonJan Philipp Gloger\u2019s self-consciously theatrical staging has plenty of ideas but less clarity, and conductor Stefano Montanari skims what Mozart has to say\n\u2018This is all about you!\u201d shouted Jan Philipp Gloger\u2019s staging of Cos\u00ec fan tutte at the audience in 2016, as the four central characters clambered on to the stage from the auditorium and were persuaded by wily Don Alfonso to enact the opera in a series of self-consciously theatrical settings. Now, with Julia Burbach directing its first revival, its message still comes over loud, if not exactly clear.\nWe move from a set resembling the Royal Opera\u2019s own foyer on to a station platform, into a cocktail bar, behind the proscenium, under the stage to the dressing rooms, and all the way up the garden path to a green baize mound underneath an apple tree wrapped in a glittery green serpent.

        "content": "French designer carves his own path with a youthful confidence that eases past the Insta-crowd\nSimon Porte Jacquemus, the designer behind 2018\u2019s giant straw hat, XXL basket and micro mini bag, has taken his latest collection in an unexpected direction.\nThe 29-year-old French wunderkind, who has been unofficially crowned the prince of Paris fashion week for his fresh take on femininity, said he was taking a step back from his much-imitated statement pieces and the skintight dresses that he has made his signature.\n\u201c[My] last shows were all about sensuality and the south of France but I\u2019m not just that,\u201d Jacquemus said. \u201cI wanted to show the arty and conceptual mood I had at the beginning [of my career] and balance that with something sensual and wearable.\u201d\nAs a result, for autumn/winter 2019 his \u201cnew dress\u201d would be a suit, he said, which came in myriad form, beautifully cut from ribbed and aran wool as well as parachute silk.\n\u201cI did so many dresses for the last couple of seasons it was too much. I wanted to do something much more masculine,\u201d the designer said. With success came a bigger budget and at last the opportunity to buy more expensive fabrics and textiles, he added.\nWith this collection, his tailoring has moved beyond the traditional to incorporate oversized pockets, leather culottes and utilitarian waistcoats. Belted coats in leopard print, structured oversized knits and long asymmetrical dresses worn over palazzo trousers came with the easy, laissez-faire attitude that makes his clothes so wearable. \u201cWhat I show is what I sell,\u201d he said.\nThere was also a lot of fun. One shirt and trouser combination in \u201cthe blue of David Hockney\u201d was styled with earrings featuring a childhood photograph of Jacquemus, his brother and his mother in a swimming pool, which customers will be able to customise. Elsewhere, large padded bumbags punctuated polished looks.\nThe set was inspired by his love of French cinema, taking on the form of a town square with florists, grocers and boulangeries. He may be eschewing the direct sartorial references to the romanticism of the riviera but he still knows how to work the aspirational lifestyle of the region to his advantage.\nPrints incorporated hand-drawn sketches of ceramic pots you might pick up in a Sunday morning flea market, while a cream trouser suit was adorned with appliqu\u00e9 tulips.\nDespite his age, Jacquemus has been around the block. After making his fashion week debut in October 2012, he was shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH prize, winning the special jury accolade the following year.\nHowever, he had been designing for years before that. A video recently surfaced of Jacquemus early in his career, dressing friends in his clothes and crashing a French Vogue consumer event in the French capital to present his designs to the then fashion editor, Emmanuelle Alt.\nIt is this youthful confidence that permeates every aspect of his brand, and with this collection he shows he is not afraid to carve his own path rather than play to the Instagram crowd. Jacquemus revealed on Monday that the change of direction had been hard but he was happy with the results.\nGiven that the French leg of the autumn/winter fashion weeks stretches for nine days, it is confirmation of his popularity and selling power that so many editors, buyers and other industry heavyweights arrived for day one to be present at his show.\nJacquemus told Fantastic Man magazine last year that he had been approached by a global French fashion house, among many others, to become its head designer, but turned the offer down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the stamp of approval that comes from working for a big house \u2026 I have a big house: Jacquemus is my house and now I want to take it somewhere.\u201d\nThis collection showed his determination and dexterity at doing so.",

But prosecutors allege she was already living in the Catalan capital between 2012 and 2014, and should have paid tax in Spain on her worldwide income for those years.\nThey argue she was resident in Spain for most of the year, only travelling abroad for short periods.\nOn Monday evening, the Catalan newspaper El Peri\u00f3dico reported a judge in Esplugues de Llobregat had agreed to investigate the case and had summoned Shakira to appear in court on 12 June.\nA spokesman for the court declined to comment on the report.\nThe tax authorities began investigating the singer in January last year.\nIn 2017, Shakira appeared in the Paradise Papers, an investigation by the Guardian and other news organisations into the world of offshore finance. According to the papers, she was listed as a resident of the Bahamas despite living in Barcelona.\nAsked at the time about Shakira\u2019s listed residence in the Bahamas, her lawyer said the artist had lived in a variety of places \u201cthroughout her professional career and, in every case, has fully met the laws of all the jurisdictions where she has resided\u201d.\nEl Peri\u00f3dico also reported that Shakira has already paid the Spanish tax authorities \u20ac14.5m to settle the debt.\nThe Grammy award winner, who set up the Bare Foot foundation for underprivileged children in 1997, is the latest high-profile figure to face legal action over their tax affairs.\nEarlier this month, the former Manchester United manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and agreed to pay \u20ac2.2m in fines after admitting tax fraud while he was the manager of Real Madrid.\nIn January, Cristiano Ronaldo admitted committing tax fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an \u20ac18.8m fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence.",

        "content": "People with disabilities in the UK and US are less likely to have a job and when they do they earn less. It\u2019s time this changed\nStark gender pay inequities have rightly not been far from the spotlight, however, despite people with disabilities on average earning significantly less than their non-disabled counterparts, we tend to hear much less about it. This needs to change. The ongoing inequities faced by people with disabilities are myriad and we should be investing as much time as we can in exposing each of them \u2013 and demanding solutions.\nAccording to the TUC, in 2017 the average hourly pay for disabled workers was \u00a39.90, compared with \u00a311.40 for their non-disabled counterparts. This translates as a disability pay gap of \u00a31.50 an hour \u2013 an average annual wage deficit of \u00a32,730 a year by the TUC\u2019s calculations. That is no incidental sum of money.\nResearch by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), meanwhile, published in 2017, found that between 1997-2014 the disability pay gap was 13% for men and 7% for women. In addition, \u201cwhere ethnic pay gaps exist, they tend to become larger when disability is factored in,\u201d the EHRC reported. On top of this, disabled people are less likely to have a job than non-disabled people in the first place \u2013 a serious problem in its own right. The 2017 Equality and Human Rights Commission EHRC disability pay gap report found that the rate of disabled people employed was 35% for both men and women while that of non-disabled workers was 63% for men and 57% for women. And, as other research has found, just 6% of adults with learning disabilities are in paid work in the UK, yet around 65% say they would like a job.\nAgainst a backdrop where, when disabled people are in work, the type of job is more likely to be low-paid, low status, or part-time then a pattern of systemic problems becomes abundantly clear. And of course, let\u2019s not forget that this is compounded yet further by the litany of cuts to benefits, which make it harder for disabled people to get to work.\nIn the US the picture is similar. People with disabilities are less likely to be in work (18.7% employed in 2017 compared with 65.7% for non-disabled people) and earn much less than non-disabled workers. For example, for women with a disability in employment, median pay in the US in 2017 was just 48 cents in the dollar of that for non-disabled men \u2013 while disabled people in general are more likely to be in poverty. Nevertheless, while Trump\u2019s America can appear steeped in dispiriting statistics, this month on the issue of pay and disability, something good came to the fore. A bipartisan effort \u2013 the Transformation to Competitive Employment Act \u2013 was introduced that aims to bring an end to \u201csub-minimum\u201d wages for disabled people. Section 14 (c) of the 80-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act permits employers who receive a certificate from the Department of Labor to pay such low wages. The TCEA, introduced by the Democrats, Senator Bob Casey and Congressman Bobby Scott along with Republican representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers , proposes phasing this out within six years. (There have been repeated efforts at a federal level to eliminate the exemption, and sub-minimum wages are already banned in some states.)\nResearch estimates that around 450,000 disabled American workers earn an average of just $2.15 an hour as a result of the exemption. To put this in context, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 but the Fight for $15 movement has led to many cities and states introducing higher minimum wages.\nThe people earning such paltry sums are usually working in food, janitorial or gardening services, or carrying out piecemeal assembly work in sheltered workshops. Rebecca Cokley, director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress, rightly says the sub-minimum wage is \u201ca fossil of disability public policy\u201d, that \u201csegregates and traps workers in dead-end jobs.\u201dUnderpinned by low expectations, low pay can not only lead to financial hardship, it sends a message that disabled people are of less value than other workers. Thankfully, in Britain when calls have been made in recent years for changes to the law so that employers can pay people with learning disabilities below the minimum wage, they have been quashed. Cokley is right when she tells me that change in the US is \u201clong overdue\u201d.\nHopefully, Congress will agree and this relic, along with the disability pay gap generally, will be consigned to history.\n Mary O\u2019Hara is an award-winning social affairs writer and author of Austerity Bites: A journey to the sharp end of cuts in the UK",

        "content": "Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has on growth, prosperity and trade\nFailure to break the Westminster deadlock over Brexit has weighed on sterling over the past month, as fears mount over a potential no-deal departure with damaging consequences for the British economy. However, there was a rebound on Tuesday, on mounting hopes of an extension to the 29 March deadline or a soft Brexit. Analysts say the pound could rise by as much as 10% if a no-deal Brexit is averted, but that it could also fall by a similar amount if Britain crashes out . The pound/dollar rate remains about 11% below its position on the eve of the Brexit vote.\nFinancial markets around the world have rallied strongly over the past month, buoyed by hopes of a deal being struck between the US and China to avoid a further escalation of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing. Central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have sounded a more cautious note over raising borrowing costs \u2013 adding to the optimism for the world economy and supporting company profits, in a positive development for the stock market. Over the month, the FTSE 100 has risen by almost 400 points and currently stands at about 7,100.\nThe biggest monthly fall in gas prices since the 1980s \u2013 coming after the introduction of the government\u2019s energy price cap \u2013 helped drag down inflation to 1.8% last month from a rate of 2.1% in December, offering hard-pressed consumers some respite ahead of Brexit. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017 after the rapid fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote. Although it has steadily fallen in recent months, economists warn a sudden drop in sterling sparked by Britain crashing out of the EU would drive inflation higher again, eroding household finances.\nMinisters have privately begun admitting to business leaders that several post-Brexit trade deals with major economies, including Japan and South Korea, won\u2019t be done in time for the 29 March deadline, in a development that has alarmed business groups. Britain\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the gap between sales of UK goods and services abroad and purchases from overseas at home \u2013 narrowed slightly in December, although not by as much as expected. Trade in cars in particular has had a large impact, with falling exports amid rising global trade tensions and weaker consumer demand in China and the eurozone.\nHeightened uncertainty over Brexit appears to have dragged the economy close to stalling point in the first month of the year. Surveys of business activity closely watched by the Bank of England and the Treasury for early warning signs from the economy showed that companies have increasingly put spending decisions on hold. Although stockpiling has helped to prop up manufacturers, growth in new orders has slumped, with firms blaming Brexit and the slowing global economy. The IHS Markit/Cips all-sector purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2013 which includes manufacturing, construction and services \u2013 fell from 51.5 to 50.3 last month \u2013 the second lowest reading since December 2012, and only just above the 50.0 mark that separates growth from recession.\nRecord numbers of unfilled job vacancies across Britain appear to have strengthened the bargaining power of workers to demand higher wages, despite mounting concern among business leaders over the growing skills shortages. The number of vacancies in the British jobs market rose by 16,000 to an estimated 870,000 in the three months to January, with unemployment at the lowest levels since the mid 1970s. Average weekly earnings have slowly begun to rise, although wages still remain below the pre-financial crisis peak. Although the jobs market provides one ray of light for the economy ahead of the Brexit deadline, economists warn the uncertainty could hit jobs in the near future.\nDiscounts in the January sales helped tempt British consumers back to the high street last month, as sales volumes rose by 1% compared with December, in a sharp rebound from one of the worst festive Christmas shopping periods of the past decade. The data will come as a rare positive for the economy ahead of Brexit, suggesting that shoppers have tuned out from the political chaos. Some surveys have, however, warned that consumers are putting bigger-ticket spending decisions on hold as Brexit looms. City economists have also warned that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s departure will be likely to keep a lid on sales over coming months.\nPhilip Hammond was handed a boost from the public finances ahead of next month\u2019s spring statement, receiving the biggest surplus for the government\u2019s coffers in January since records began in 1993. Government income from taxes outstripped public spending by \u00a314.9bn, after self-assessment income tax and capital gains tax receipts were stronger than expected. While January is usually a month when the public finances are in surplus, given seasonal differences in receipts, the surplus was \u00a35.5bn larger than a year ago. Although Hammond appears on track to hit his deficit reduction targets, economists warn a no-deal Brexit would blow apart the progress he has made.\nBrexit uncertainty and stretched levels of affordability are continuing to stifle the UK housing market, making estate agents the gloomiest they have been in a decade over property values. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that house price growth slowed to 2.5% in the year to December, dragged down by the London market where prices are falling. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors\u2019 monthly house price balance \u2013 which measures the difference between the number of estate agents and property surveyors anticipating increases and those expecting decreases \u2013 dropped to -22% in January, the lowest level since March 2009.\nWhile the gloomiest of economic forecasts made ahead of the EU referendum in 2016 might not have come to pass, increasing evidence has emerged of the gradual damage the vote unleashed for the economy. This month, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, put the cost at \u00a340bn a year of lost GDP growth compared to a vote to remain two-and-a-half years ago. That\u2019s about \u00a3800m a week, he said, which is more than double what the leave campaign claimed could be saved on EU membership fees and instead spent on the NHS. Since the referendum, the UK\u2019s economic growth has slowed while the rest of the world has recorded one of its strongest periods for growth of the past decade \u2013 with a particular deterioration in business investment, as major companies put their spending decisions on hold amid the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future.",

There are positives putting Britain on a stronger footing ahead of Brexit from the jobs market and growth in household spending.\nHowever, two former Bank of England policymakers warn that clouds are gathering for the future as the UK braces for a no-deal departure.\nWhile unemployment in the final months before Brexit is at the lowest level since the mid 1970s, more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the British car industry have been put at risk by the lack of clarity over future trading relationships and shifting trends in the worldwide automotive sector. Honda, the Japanese carmaker, announced plans to close its Swindon plant, while Jaguar Land Rover and Ford have also said they will axe thousands of jobs.\nWriting in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, warned: \u201cClosing plants hits jobs and wages.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cWe need to focus on what is happening now as Brexit approaches, not what happened in those halcyon pre-Brexit days. Stand by for gale-force winds approaching.\u201d\nTo gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian is monitoring eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100.\nEconomists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. In three cases, the result was worse than forecast.\nOn the latest dashboard, consumer spending recovered sharply in January after one of the worst Christmas trading periods of the past decade. Inflation cooled to the lowest level in two years, helped by the biggest monthly fall in gas prices since the late 1980s coinciding with the introduction of the government\u2019s energy price cap.\nPhilip Hammond received an early boost before the spring statement thanks to the biggest monthly surplus in the public finances since records began in 1993, coming as he faces pressure to end austerity. However, the chancellor also faces the risk that a no-deal Brexit could plunge the economy into recession and blow apart the public finances.\nSurveys of business activity closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signs from the economy show that growing numbers of companies have put big spending decisions on hold. Stockpiling has helped to prop up factory output, but growth in new orders has slumped, with firms blaming Brexit and the wider slowdown in the world economy.\nAmid the global slowdown and trade wars between the US and China, the UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the gap between exports and imports \u2013 has grown, despite the weakness in the pound since the Brexit vote, which should have made British goods more competitive on the world stage.\nExporters sending goods to far-flung destinations are now doing so with the risk that their shipments are locked out of harbours around the world, following the failure of ministers to roll over several EU trade deals with a series of major trading partners, including Japan and South Korea.\nThe economy grew by just 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, down from 0.6% in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter figures contained evidence of an even sharper slowdown, with the economy posting a decline of 0.4% in December amid signs that Brexit uncertainty is taking hold.\nBusiness investment has collapsed into the weakest period since the financial crisis with four successive quarters of falling corporate spending last year, paving the way for weaker economic growth in future.\nWriting in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, another former MPC member, said: \u201cThe forward-looking indicators \u2013 productivity, trade performance, investment and job announcements \u2013 point to a further weakening in the UK economy.\u201d",

GDP growth slowed in the final quarter of last year, and business investment was nearly 4% down on a year ago. Export volumes grew by just 0.2% in 2018, the lowest growth rate in the volume of overseas sales since the global financial crisis.\nOn the other hand, employment growth has been strong and consumer spending has been resilient.

First, while the jobs numbers currently look positive, we have seen a number of negative announcements which will affect the employment outlook in the 2020s, most recently from Honda but also from many other international investors in the UK. Second, productivity shows little sign of recovering. Headline employment is up 1.4% on a year ago, but GDP has risen just 1.3%. All of our economic growth is coming from job creation and none from increased productivity.\nA third worrying indicator is the trade balance. The UK\u2019s trade deficit in goods and services exceeded \u00a310bn in the fourth quarter of 2018, a level reached only in four previous quarters in our economic history. Finally, the negative trend in investment looks set to continue, according to surveys of business opinion.\nIn the second half of 2016, after the Brexit referendum result, resilient consumer spending supported the economy before the slowdown which followed. We may be seeing the same thing now. The forward-looking indicators \u2013 productivity, trade performance, investment and job announcements \u2013 point to a further weakening in the UK economy.\nProfessor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and member of the MPC from 2006 to 2009\nThe Brexit deadline of 29 March looms. Worryingly, according to the Bank of England, half of businesses feel they are not ready for a no-deal, no-transition Brexit. Uncertainty prevails, which of course caused business investment to fall last year. GDP growth in the UK is slowing, with fourth-quarter growth at 0.2%, down from 0.6% in the previous quarter as Brexit approaches. Plus, the growing list of firms planning to leave the UK is growing apace in a worrying sign for the future. Statistics bureaus have a hard time of working out turning points, and the numbers are often revised down, just as they were in 2008.\nGertjan Vlieghe, a current MPC member, has argued that Brexit is already costing the UK \u00a3800m a week, more than double the \u00a3350m a week savings that leavers had wrongly suggested Brexit would bring. Oops.\nIt is unclear how much of this slowing is down to Brexit. But what is clear is that Britain leaving the EU couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time, as the very long global recovery since the financial crisis is now coming to an end.\nTrade wars haven\u2019t helped and neither have rate rises in the US. Italy is already in recession and Germany is close, with zero growth in the last quarter, and negative growth in the prior quarter. There is also a growing prospect that the US will be in recession within a year. Markets are increasingly pricing in the next rate decision by the Federal Reserve to be a cut. Industrial production figures in Europe have been disastrous, with 17 out of 27 countries recording negative growth in December.\nI was especially struck by the declines in UK consumer confidence. In the latest release for the UK for January, there were big drops in consumers\u2019 reports of their financial situation over the past 12 months and their expectations on what will happen to them over next 12 months. There has also been a marked pick-up in unemployment expectations over the next year.\nThat brings us on to the labour market, which is a lagging indicator, and has started to show some signs of slowing. Closing plants hits jobs and wages.\nSo far employment has continued to grow and the unemployment rate remains low, but there are signs of weakening. The number of temporary workers and people in underemployment has started rising.\nCommentators have wrongly focused on the annual growth rate of 3.4%, which has been driven by what happened a year ago \u2013 so called base effects. On the monthly basis, the picture is less robust. Average weekly earnings growth has stalled at \u00a3527 per week for the last three months in a row, and has fallen from \u00a3528 in October to \u00a3525 in December in the private sector.\nWe need to focus on what is happening now as Brexit approaches, not what happened in those halcyon pre-Brexit days. Stand by for gale-force winds approaching.",

Eve Leigh\u2019s new play, about the struggles of old age and mourning, falls into the trap of emotionally manipulative music and sentimentality without so much as a cup-and-ball sleight of hand to misdirect us. The humour rarely lands and every line about loss is piled with emotion, so that its desire for us to be sad becomes overbearing.\nElderly widow Mira (Lachele Carl) is comforted by the ghost of her husband, Jonah (David Verrey), who died seven months ago. Carl is too supple in both mind and movement for us to believe in her frailty, and her relationship with Verrey doesn\u2019t hold enough force to make her inability to move on feel credible.\nEverything about The Trick is almost interesting: the morphing structure, veering from variety act to scientific explainer; a session of brain-freezing ice-cream gorging; a recurring search for the trick behind a good life. Ani Nelson and Sharlene Whyte have fun as conniving plumbers trying to dupe Mira out of her money, but the story goes randomly off course.\nIn one shaky palm-reading scene, Nelson determines the future love, life and death of an audience member. It\u2019s an uncomfortable moment and could easily go wrong depending on the individual\u2019s health.\nDirector Roy Alexander Weise tries to inject a jazz-hands pizazz into the bland gloom but tips into cliches: the blown leaves and almost-touching hands are eye-rollingly cringeworthy. The sweet ending may tug at some hearts, but frankly, these are easy topics to hurt us with, and it\u2019s not done with enough delicacy to really enchant.\nThe Trick is at the Bush theatre, London, until 23 March.",

The 24-year-old singer-guitarist has toured with Michael Kiwanuka, been playlisted by Radio 1 and sold out this headline tour. The latest recipient of the Brits\u2019 critics\u2019 choice award (previously given to Adele, Sam Smith et al) can already excitedly refer to his next gig in Manchester, \u201cover the road\u201d \u2013 at the much larger Ritz, where he will appear in May. \u201cA couple of months ago I was sat in me mam\u2019s,\u201d he splurts.\nThe likably open geordie offers something slightly different in 2019. His huge, quivering holler is delivered over dystopian post-punk tropes, radio-friendly pop rock and homespun, honest storytelling: an unlikely blend of early Simple Minds, Psychedelic Furs, Hothouse Flowers and (his hero) Bruce Springsteen. It\u2019s an arena-sized sound that \u2013 being performed for the band\u2019s first time as a five-piece \u2013 can get claustrophobic or bombastic in a smaller venue. The more math-rock Play God has a propulsive groove, but Fender should lose the stadium rock guitar solos: his words need space to breathe.\nHe still proudly lives in North Shields and, like fellow geordie Nadine Shah, a love-hate relationship with the area\u2019s rundown coastal environments fired his songwriting. He can appear judgmental, whether jabbing at the local square\u2019s \u201cplastic action men and Poundshop Kardashians\u201d or That Sound\u2019s \u201cgreen-eyed beasts\u201d, who envy those who get out. However, at his best, he confronts the north\u2019s beauty and ugliness \u2013 from toxic masculinity to overdoses \u2013 with searing rawness. Dead Boys \u2013 about the north-east\u2019s young male suicides \u2013 rings around the room with haunting power. Home truths spawn poetry in Leave Fast\u2019s tales of coastlines where kids \u201cfreeze their lungs and run amongst the rolling dunes away from everyone\u201d and \u201cAn old man told me to leave fast or stay forever\u201d. Fender hasn\u2019t yet quite navigated the competing forces of his natural intimacy and a quest for big and brash, but he is clearly a special talent.\n At Electric Brixton, London, on 28 February, then touring.",

        "content": "Average income of the poorest fifth of the population shrunk by 1.6% last year, says ONS\nIncome inequality across Britain increased over the course of 2018 as cuts to benefits damaged the finances of poorer households while the wealthiest in society got richer, official figures show.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the average income of the poorest fifth of the population after inflation contracted by 1.6% in the last financial year ending in 2018, while the average income of the richest fifth rose by 4.7%.\nThe Whitehall statistics body singled out the falling average value of cash benefits for the poorest households as the main driver behind the decline in their income, while a rise in earnings from employment lifted the income of the richest.\nIt also said that median household disposable income growth had plateaued last year at \u00a328,400, ending four years of steady increases for the strength of household finances.\nThe latest snapshot into the health of household finances across the country suggests that welfare cuts imposed by the government have exacerbated inequalities, at a time of mounting political and economic divisions.\nSeparate analysis has previously shown the Brexit vote damaged average household incomes, after the sharp drop in the pound immediately after the referendum result drove higher inflation, outstripping wage rises.\nTheresa May has come under growing pressure to enact her promise to end austerity, after almost a decade of cuts to benefits and services. Household benefits for millions of families, including those in work, have been frozen over the last four years under a policy launched by the then chancellor, George Osborne, in 2015.\nThe policy, in place until 2020, means household benefit payments do not rise in line with inflation. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates the average lower-income family with children will be \u00a3200 worse off this year as a consequence.\nDespite the deterioration in household income last year, the ONS said the longer-term picture was more positive for poorer families. Since the 2008 financial crisis, it is the average income of the poorest fifth that has risen the most, up 11.6%, compared with the richest fifth, rising by 4.9% over the same period.\nThe highest 1% of earners in the country have, however, managed to protect their share of total household disposable income over the past seven years, with the richest 1% of the population controlling 7.1% of total household disposable income.\nThe ONS said income inequality had increased slightly last year when measured using the Gini coefficient \u2013 a sliding scale between 0 and 100 where higher values represent a greater degree of inequality \u2013 with the gauge ticking up from 31.4 to 32.5 last year in the UK.\nDespite the small increase last year, income inequality remains slightly lower than the levels reached 11 years ago, although is substantially higher than during the 1970s and 1980s before income inequality rapidly accelerated in Britain and several other major economies.\nDominic Webber, the head of household income and expenditure analysis at the ONS, said: \u201cWhile our report highlights a contraction in average income for the poorest fifth of the population, the longer-term trend has seen this group\u2019s income rise the most. As such it may be too early to draw definite conclusions from this specific downtick.\n\u201cThose in the richest fifth have seen a greater change, as well as a sustained rise over a number of years, which has helped to drive an increase in inequality.\u201d\nA Treasury spokesperson said unemployment was at a historic low, it had raised the national living wage and was cutting taxes to help families.\n\u201cBut we recognise the importance of providing more support to those who need it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re spending an additional \u00a31.7bn a year on universal credit and by 2022 we will be spending \u00a328bn more on welfare than we do now.\u201d",

        "content": "Few musicians start out in pop, move into the avant garde, invent post-rock and then go silent for decades. But Talk Talk\u2019s Hollis was no ordinary musician\nIf you were paying very close attention to the music that Talk Talk released in the early 80s, you might have realised that they were not a band cut out to do what was expected of them. At the time, it was widely held in pop magazines that the London quartet were here to challenge to Duran Duran\u2019s stranglehold over teenage affections. In fairness, they gave it their best shot. They posed for pin-up friendly photographs in the post-new romantic clobber of the day: crisp white clothes, shirts and ties, a look that bore a debt to Roxy Music in latter-day sophisticated mode.\nThey bedecked their songs with synthesisers and the modish sound of fretless bass: their drummer played one of those octagonal Simmons electronic kits, de rigueur on Top of the Pops at the time. Their 1982 debut album The Party\u2019s Over was glossy and derivative, nothing to frighten the horses, although the lyrics of the title track suggested a certain jarring intensity: \u201cTake this punishment away Lord \u2026 too much hope I\u2019ve seen as virtue.\u201d Its follow-up, It\u2019s My Life, was a bigger hit \u2013 a Top 10 smash on the continent, its title track a US chart breakthrough \u2013 but something about it suggested that the kind of scream-inducing fame Talk Talk were apparently being groomed for wasn\u2019t going to sit right.\nFrontman Mark Hollis\u2019s voice was simultaneously too anguished and too vague; he clearly cared more about feeling than diction. Beneath the production lustre, the music on Such a Shame and Does Caroline Know? rather implied it was made by people with a love of progressive rock, not something you admitted to in a hurry in the pages of Number One magazine: Talk Talk supported Genesis when the latter reunited with Peter Gabriel for a one-off gig.\nAnd then there was the saga of the video for It\u2019s My Life itself. The first version consisted of wildlife footage intercut with shots of Mark Hollis glowering at the camera, mouth clamped shut. When their record label protested, Talk Talk made a second version, miming theatrically and lip-syncing deliberately out of time, as if mocking the whole business. You didn\u2019t win over MTV behaving like that.\nBut if you might have worked out that Talk Talk were ill-suited to mainstream pop success, no one could have predicted what was about to happen. As it turned out, Mark Hollis wasn\u2019t just a grumpy refusenik who didn\u2019t like miming in videos and name-dropped Miles Davis and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k in interviews. He was an artist with a completely singular and uncompromising musical vision that would eventually spawn an entire musical sub-genre. He would spend the next six years following his own route with painstaking exactitude, in the process changing Talk Talk\u2019s music so completely that, by the time they split up in 1991, they were utterly unrecognisable as the band who\u2019d once appeared on Top of the Pops singing their hit single Today to an audience wearing deely-boppers.\nThe first sign of his shift in direction came with 1986\u2019s The Colour of Spring. \u201cThat whole synth side,\u201d Hollis had decreed, \u201cget it in the bin.\u201d The single Life\u2019s What You Make It was idiosyncratically funky and euphoric \u2013 you could see why it ended up a big record with Balearic DJs playing to ecstasy-blasted dancefloors \u2013 but elsewhere, The Colour of Spring drew on everything from jazz horns to children\u2019s choirs. There were epic orchestrations, but on Chameleon Day or the impossibly beautiful April 5th, there was also music that sounded sparse and abstract.\nEventually, Hollis would become famous for the amount of music he recorded, then wiped, before declaring a song complete. (\u201cBefore you play two notes, learn how to play one note,\u201d he offered as explanation for this approach, \u201cand don\u2019t play one note unless you\u2019ve got a reason to play it.\u201d) A few years earlier, Talk Talk had sounded desperate to fit in with the musical zeitgeist: now they sounded completely out of step with current pop trends \u2013 it was the year of sophisticated pop-soul and big AOR ballads \u2013 and lost in their own world. When a reporter from Smash Hits attended the ensuing tour, they reported back in horror that Hollis had distractedly wandered on stage and started playing wearing no shoes, only a pair of socks. No one would ever suggest Talk Talk were cut from the same cloth as Duran Duran again.\nChameleon Day suggested the direction Talk Talk would follow on 1988\u2019s Spirit of Eden, the album that sealed their reputation as one of the most extraordinary bands of their era, at least in retrospect. Incredibly, given its current standing, Spirit of Eden was coolly received on release. \u201cAimless,\u201d offered one critic. \u201cPretentious,\u201d suggested another. Or perhaps that wasn\u2019t so incredible. An album that took nine apparently agonising months to make and was, by all accounts, largely recorded in the dark \u2013 the only lighting in the studio coming from the kind of oil wheel popular with 60s psychedelic light shows \u2013 Spirit of Eden didn\u2019t so much play as gradually unfurl. Cut loose from standard verse-chorus structures, its six songs slowly but irreversibly worked their way under your skin.\nThe music mapped out a new territory somewhere between avant-garde rock, jazz, modern classical and ambient, an intersection that would subsequently be dubbed post-rock. That term would come to be applied to music that sounded like an arid intellectual exercise, which was not an accusation you could throw at Spirit of Eden. Its six songs were frequently profoundly moving, never more so than on the astonishing I Believe In You, a song inspired by Hollis\u2019s elder brother\u2019s long descent into heroin addiction. Once the manager of Eddie and the Hot Rods, Ed Hollis would die before the album was released. Tellingly, the tributes to Mark Hollis on social media dwell on the intense connection listeners felt with his music, mentioning how it had helped them during bereavement and times of emotional upheaval.\nQ magazine called Spirit of Eden \u201cthe kind of record which encourages marketing men to commit suicide\u201d. In fact, its release provoked a series of events that ended in a court battle between Talk Talk and their label, during which EMI attempted to claim the album was not complete because it was not \u201ccommercially satisfactory\u201d. This was clearly not a criticism that found much favour with Hollis. Recorded for a new label, Spirit of Eden\u2019s successor Laughing Stock was, if anything, even more oblique and introverted.\nStories about its recording sessions are legion and legendary. Clocks were banned from the studio so no one knew what time it was. Guest musicians were told to do whatever they felt without being played the song they were supposed to be performing on. Engineer Phill Brown later claimed that Hollis erased 80% of the music he recorded. The results were amorphous, but remarkable: squalling noise and free jazz alongside becalmed loveliness \u2013 the wonderful New Grass \u2013 and moments of silence, something Hollis claimed he would rather listen to than music.\nCertainly, silence came to define the last 28 years of Mark Hollis\u2019s life. Shortly after Laughing Stock\u2019s release, Talk Talk quietly disbanded. Seven years later, Hollis released an eponymous solo album: hushed, sparse, beautiful and largely acoustic, listening to it felt like covertly eavesdropping on something intimate and personal. He gave a few interviews, then, to all intents and purposes vanished, although friends were quick to point out that his wasn\u2019t the angst-ridden withdrawal of a tortured artist: he simply didn\u2019t want to make music any more, preferring to spend time with his family. \u201cIt was like he changed jobs,\u201d noted one.\nIn his absence, the mythology around the music he had made grew: everyone from Radiohead to the Mars Volta to Elbow paid homage. One intriguing theory was that musicians weren\u2019t simply drawn to his work because of its quality, but because it represented something that had become idealistic and literally unattainable. Times had changed, and so had the music industry: no major label would now spend that much money making albums as unbending and leftfield as Spirit of Eden or Laughing Stock.\nThe myth around Hollis grew to such proportions that when he was enticed into recording 90 seconds of incidental music for US TV drama Boss in 2012, it became a news story, replete with suggestions that it was a sign he would return to releasing music. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cI did it. Full stop,\u201d he told one acquaintance who inquired about the possibility. He was right. It\u2019s one thing to doggedly pursue your own path without compromise, another thing entirely to be so talented and unique that you inexorably draw people into your world while doing so. Mark Hollis did it. Full stop.\n This article was amended on 5 March 2019 to change the spelling of Phil Brown to Phill.",

It says the negotiations exclude broad sections of Afghan society, including women and young people, as well as democratic structures, government and institutions.\n\u201cOver the last 17 years we have fought to bring women\u2019s voices and interests into Afghanistan\u2019s political, social and cultural institutions, against a backdrop of ongoing violence,\u201d it says.\nThe Afghan signatories, describing themselves as \u201ccivilians, doctors, activists, student and artists,\u201d say they have \u201ccollectively and individually created space to advocate both for ourselves and for peace in our country\u201d.\n\u201cMany of our leaders have paid with their lives for this progress,\u201d the letter adds, highlighting cases including the 2012 killing of Hanifa Safi, a prominent Afghan politician who was blown up in her car, and Farkhunda Malikzada, 27, who was publicly beaten and killed by a street mob in Kabul in 2015.\n\u201cThe gains made from these hard-won battles are now being threatened by a deal that excludes our interests and voices and ignores the representations we have fought for,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIt is at this critical moment for the future of our young people, our women, and our democracy that we ask for global solidarity, so we can continue to build on our victories.\u201d\nIt continues: \u201cWhen the coalition arrived in Afghanistan in 2001, it was on the back of promises made to Afghan women and future generations. We have been fighting for our rights and representation ever since. As we prepare to defend our rights once more, we ask that this peace process reaffirms and protects our constitutional rights, interests and democracy.\u201d\nThe letter was the initiative of Time4RealPeace, a coalition of Afghan women and young people that aims to raise awareness about the lack of female involvement in the peace process.\nRahela Sidiqi and Sahar Halaimzai, two of the letter\u2019s four coordinators, said: \u201cAfghans are dealing daily with the legacy of violence, the Taliban, warlords and ethnic factions, but we now have a constitutional framework to deal with these issues and a new generation of Afghans \u2013 women and men \u2013 committed to creating peace and stability.\n\u201cWe have come together to demand a legitimate peace process that includes our interests and our democratic institutions. Not one that simply trades US withdrawal and our democracy, however fragile, for shallow Taliban promises to respect rule of law, protect women\u2019s constitutional rights and not monopolise power.\u201d",

        "content": "When the verdict came, the room was still. No one made a sound\n Up to 100 journalists accused of breaking suppression order may face jail\nFive times guilty: how Pell\u2019s past caught up with him\nFor nearly three months a small group of journalists watched as the most powerful Catholic official to be charged with child sexual abuse faced justice in a Melbourne courtroom.\nUntil now we have been unable to publish a word of what we heard and saw.\nCardinal George Pell, a confidant to the pope and the financial manager of the Vatican, had been on trial for child sexual abuse \u2013 not once, but twice.\nBut a suppression order meant that the thousands of words recorded by the media \u2013 including the Guardian \u2013 through first a mistrial and then a retrial had to remain carefully protected in notepads and on personal computers. Nothing could be published.\nThe court had ruled that the interests of justice were paramount. Pell was due to face yet another trial involving more allegations \u2013 this time accused of molesting boys in a swimming pool. And, without a suppression order, news of the preceding trials would have received saturation coverage \u2013 potentially biasing a future jury.\nSo when the extraordinary guilty verdict came in December 2018, it too, for a time, was suppressed.\nBut with that \u201cswimmers trial\u201d now dropped owing to a lack of admissible evidence we can now reveal how justice unfolded, the day-to-day detail of the case and how the media\u2019s behaviour and the allegations of a \u201ccover-up\u201d affected those at the centre of it all.\nPell\u2019s first trial began in August 2018. Known as the \u201ccathedral trial\u201d in legal and journalistic circles, it lasted for five weeks.\nAfter a week of deliberations the jurors could not reach an unanimous verdict, or even a majority verdict of 11 to one. Their distress was clear. Five of them were in tears.\nThe chief judge of Victoria\u2019s county court, Peter Kidd \u2013 always thorough and often no-nonsense \u2013 reassured them. \u201cIn some cases, the burden is much greater than others,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the moment you were empanelled over a month ago the burden was going to be greater than most.\u201d\nBut he also left them with a warning: \u201cWhatever took place in that jury room must stay there.\u201d\nAnd it did.\nA new jury needed to be selected for the retrial, which began in November. As with the first trial, journalists watched via videolink from a courtroom on the third floor as 250 would-be jurors crowded into a room on the lower level of the county court.\nThe unusually large group was called because there were fears that so many people would have biases towards or against the Catholic church that finding non-prejudiced jurors would be difficult.\nAs they took their seats, Kidd told them they faced selection for the \u201cdirector of public prosecutions versus Pell\u201d trial.\nThere was an audible shift in the room as he clarified: \u201cThat is, Cardinal George Pell.\u201d\nWhile only 12 jurors can decide a verdict, 14 were chosen in case any dropped out owing to illness or for other reasons, with two to be balloted off come the deliberations.\nPell had the right to challenge up to three jurors as their numbers were pulled out of a ballot box and their occupations read out. He challenged none. Nine men and five women were sworn in, among them a church pastor, a mathematician, a chef and a schoolteacher.\nJournalists braced themselves for five more weeks of the same witnesses, questioning and arguments they had heard before. Notes meticulously gathered during the first trial were now almost useless. They attended knowing there was a very real possibility the jury could be hung once again.\nSeeing Pell in court each day quickly became mundane.\nEach morning the cardinal would be dropped off by a black car. He always wore the same thing: black trousers, a black shirt and, sometimes, a beige jacket. Police would usher him inside and he would be expedited through security, receiving a pat-down rather than a scan because of his pacemaker.\nA Catholic church official, Katrina Lee, was usually by his side as he made his way up to level four of the building. There they would lock themselves away in a tiny meeting room outside courtroom 4.3 until proceedings began.\nPell made his way between the dock and this cramped meeting room every day, moving slowly with the assistance of a cane because of an injured knee. The meeting room held a standard white office table, a few chairs and a bin. A single internal window gave a view to the floors below.\nIn the dock he was accompanied by a police officer who sat to his left, and in court breaks he would be joined in the meeting room by Lee and members of the defence team.\nThey would bring him lunch: deliveries from Uber Eats, pickle sandwiches, sausage rolls and milkshakes. They would sometimes laugh and joke. For a time, journalists would gather in the equally crowded meeting room adjoining Pell\u2019s \u2013 until security realised the walls were thin and conversation about topics such as lunch orders could be overheard.\nThe next-door room was locked after that, and Pell\u2019s was guarded by security. Journalists instead charged their laptops and discussed the case in a separate meeting room a few metres away.\nBy the second trial there were only about eight reporters left who attended every day, with stretched newsrooms unable to dedicate resources to the entirety of another five-week trial.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nPeople who were connected enough to know the trial was taking place filed in and out of the courtroom throughout: the Jesuit priest Frank Brennan, the former deputy prime minister and ambassador to the Vatican Tim Fischer, and barristers and judges from surrounding courts. They stopped by, still in their robes and wigs, to observe one of the most notable cases in memory unfold.\nThe prominent child abuse campaigner Chrissie Foster, who fought the Catholic church for justice for two of her daughters who were raped by a priest, also attended regularly.\nOther church supporters and priests came in and out, too, sometimes approaching the dock to shake Pell\u2019s hand and wish him well. A priest was kicked out by security for being disruptive, making noises in agreement with Pell\u2019s defence team, and frequently forgetting to turn off his phone.\nSome other abuse survivors and their advocates would plant themselves among the journalists, seeing them as allies, with at least one whispering their thoughts while witnesses were cross-examined. It put journalists in an awkward position \u2013 we were there not to take sides but to record an important trial unfolding.\nAnd it was this unlikely collective of people who paced the corridor and filled the meeting rooms outside the courtroom after the second jury retired to deliberate. Pell and his team shut themselves away in the tiny room.\nStaying nearby was essential because, once a verdict was reached, events would move fast, and reporters risked not being alerted in time. So they waited and watched for movement, for the lawyers to emerge and re-enter the court. After three and a half days, word came that the jurors were done. A couple of dozen people filed into the courtroom. After months, a clear outcome appeared to have been reached.\nOn the surface, Pell\u2019s legal team looked relaxed as they took their seats at the bar table. Minutes later, it was hard for the defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, to conceal his shock as his client was found guilty of one count of sexually penetrating a 13-year-old boy and four counts of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old boys.\nRichter\u2019s confident demeanour evaporated. His voice barely rose above a whisper as he discussed bail requirements and a sentencing date with the judge.\nMany in the room joined in the counsel\u2019s disbelief. Doubts of a conviction were partly driven by the outcome of the first trial. And only the jurors and legal teams had seen the victim\u2019s evidence, which was critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.\nThe public, including media, were barred from witnessing his testimony, as is common in sexual abuse trials, to spare survivors from additional trauma and to protect their identities.\nThis meant that all the journalists had heard was evidence from a number of choirboys and from former church staff who had not witnessed the offences occur, and who often struggled to recall details about the church, Sunday solemn mass, and the movements of Pell and the choirboys more than two decades after the fact. There was also an interview between Pell and two detectives in Rome which was remarkable for the Cardinal\u2019s confidence and dismissiveness of any wrongdoing.\nSo, when the verdict came, the room was still. No one made a sound. The news \u2013 which would usually erupt on to websites and across airwaves throughout the world within seconds \u2013 needed to stay within newsrooms for the time being.\nBut despite a strict suppression order \u2013 in place because of the \u201cswimmers trial\u201d Pell was facing, and the need to ensure that future jurors would not be biased \u2013 the verdict proved too sensational to contain.\nWhile the journalists who were the courtroom day in, day out did not themselves write anything, the court alerted the wider media to the suppressed decision \u2013 as is common after a trial because of the public interest.\nReporters from international news organisations published articles despite the suppression order being in place; these necessarily lacked detail because their authors were unlikely to have been in court.\nSoon tweets and opinion pieces were also being published by media outlets who attempted to be cryptic, and which lamented the overuse of suppression orders in Australian courts. Some of those news organisations have since been issued with contempt-of-court notices and journalists face possible jail time.\nSome readers saw the international reports and the tweets, and the local vague coverage, and threatened to stop supporting Australian news organisations which had not covered the story, accusing them of failing to work in the public interest.\nIn a hearing held on 13 December, two days after the verdict, a lawyer representing several Australian media companies argued before Kidd that the suppression should be lifted now that the verdict was somewhat out. Kidd, usually so measured and cerebral, could not contain his fury.\n\u201cThe way I see it at the moment is that some of this publicity was designed to put improper pressure upon me,\u201d Kidd said.\n\u201cAnd, indeed, it is positively misleading \u2026 My [suppression] order was never appealed. Indeed, quite dishonestly these articles refrain from informing their readers that there was no opposition [by media] to the suppression order being made in Victoria.\n\u201cIt is just breathtaking.\u201d\nHe kept the suppression in place, saying the story had not spread so widely or with enough detail for it to be completely ineffective.\nIt was a decision which in the end proved correct \u2013 the story did not disseminate much further after the initial publications outside of Australia. And it was a decision that reflected Kidd\u2019s handling of the trial as a whole. Considered, diligent and fair.\nIndeed, during those many weeks in court, if either party crossed a line in their examination of witnesses they copped a swift rebuke. Both the prosecution and the defence seemed to respect Kidd greatly.\nKidd repeatedly told the jury he would give no hints as to the verdict they should return, and that they were not to make Pell a scapegoat for the church\u2019s failings. Pell was at a significant disadvantage, he told them, owing to the decades that had passed and the fact he could not gather evidence from witnesses when their memories were more sound.\n\u201cYou alone are the judges in this case,\u201d he told the jurors. \u201cIt is not my responsibility to decide this case. That is your role. The verdict you return has nothing to do with me. You are not bound by any comments I make about the facts. Do not look to me for hints. I won\u2019t give you any.\u201d\nHe urged jurors to go home each night and clear their heads, he wished them restful weekends, and he acknowledged the gravity of the task they had randomly been assigned.\nWhen a juror fell asleep while he was speaking, he said he would \u201ctry not to to take it personally\u201d \u2013 then sent jurors away for the evening to ensure they only heard evidence while totally focused.\nIn the aftermath of the verdict, Richter, one of the most well-known and expensive defence barristers in Melbourne, will be asking himself what went wrong. It was, by all accounts, his case to lose.\nThe answer may be in part that his courtroom style \u2013 at times confrontational and theatrical \u2013 is more palatable to jurors hearing cases involving criminal underworld figures than those considering harrowing crimes of child sexual abuse. His closing address was unwieldy. It lasted two days and referenced US television shows, Darth Vader and the Queen. There was even a PowerPoint presentation.\nRichter closed by warning the jurors that if they convicted Pell: \u201cYou can\u2019t can\u2019t come back and say, \u2018Oops, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake.\u2019\u201d It may have appeared condescending.\nBy contrast the crown prosecutor Mark Gibson\u2019s closing address took about one day, and was delivered with no theatrics. At times, it was almost dry. He took the jurors to direct quotes given by witnesses throughout the trial. He walked them step-by-step through what the victim said had happened. He told jurors they should find the victim was believable, an honest historian, describing as best he could horrific events that happened to him as a 13-year-old through the eyes of a man now in his 30s.\nThe combination of a compelling witness and Gibson\u2019s measured approach made the offences seem not \u201cimprobable\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d as Richter claimed, but real and painful.\nThere will be an appeal, Pell and his lawyers have confirmed. And, in the meantime, media company executives and journalists may be brought to the court to explain why they breached the suppression order. The pope will eventually need to respond to the verdict.\nThe months of silence and pressure on those in the trial has lifted. But the story is far from over.",

        "content": "The author of a novel to help young people deal with anorexia says his message is a hopeful one - most people recover\nWhen an eating disorder took hold of Samuel Pollen at the age of 12 he felt as if the bad cop within him was taking over. He says anorexia is like having a severe voice in your head that grows to be all-consuming, but is also separate from who you really are.\nNow, aged 30, he is able to talk openly about his childhood experience. To help others he has written a book, The Year I Didn\u2019t Eat, which chronicles 12 months in the life of fictional 14-year-old Max as he struggles with anorexia.\n\u201cIn the book I draw out a separate character who is the eating disorder \u2026 a bad cop version of you is a good way of summarising it [an eating disorder], a severe voice. I guess we all have an internal filter that makes us do things: for example, get up, or think, \u2018I should go to the party\u2019. But it\u2019s that on a grand scale and about every aspect of food,\u201d he says.\nThe problem of eating disorders has never been more prominent. There has been a dramatic rise in hospital admissions for conditions such as anorexia and bulimia in recent years. Figures obtained by the Guardian from NHS Digital show year-on-year rises in hospital visits in England, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before \u2013 the biggest spike in eight years.\nExperts have said the surge in numbers is down to the failure of NHS services to tackle anorexia and bulimia at an earlier stage, before people become so unwell that they need to be admitted to hospital.\nThere has also been a notable rise in men experiencing the condition. The number of adult men being admitted to hospital with an eating disorder has risen by 70% over the past six years \u2013 the same rate of increase as among women.\nPollen says the rise could be down to more awareness but he also thinks it\u2019s a wider societal problem. \u201cEating disorders happen when people look at who they think society wants them or expects them to be and they see a mismatch. It\u2019s a weird way of taking control of that situation, thinking \u2018this is the thing I can do\u2019, and that gets worse as we have more self-scrutiny and loneliness.\u201d\nHis disorder started when he got into exercise, running and restricted eating. \u201cIt got worse over a period of six months and then I got the flu, and I was too weak to go upstairs. Mum called the doctor, who referred me to children\u2019s mental health services, and I sought outpatient treatment from there,\u201d he explains.\nHe saw a clinical psychologist weekly for the first few months and then less frequently. \u201cI responded well to having a medical authority figure take the problem seriously. Oddly, I think even just the diagnosis helped, because it brought home that something was really wrong.\u201d\nPollen believes a quick referral by the NHS in east Cheshire where he lived with his parents was key to his recovery, and that it would be much harder for him today with children facing long waits for treatment.\n\u201cEarly intervention is so critical in eating disorders because breaking patterns and behaviours is such a big part of the treatment. The longer you leave it, the harder it gets,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI was lucky \u2013 my progress from that point was relatively smooth, and I did not have any significant relapses, which is the most common experience, but also one a lot of people don\u2019t have. That is testament to the fact I had a very supportive family. Pollen believes there was no one trigger for his illness, but he says he has always been an anxious person, and someone driven by goals and worries about under-performing. \u201cIt [having an eating disorder]is a weird one but it feels sort of clever and something you can do well that others cannot necessarily do, and that is the reinforcer, the idea you are doing something better than others.\u201d\nHe notes that the pressure on women is relentlessly \u201cthin-based\u201d, but it can be more complex for men. \u201cThere are lots of related things, such as body dysmorphia \u2026 my eating disorder was very fitness based. I ran a lot and obviously everyone has a slightly different experience and something that happened is \u2026 that idea of desirable male bodies. I grew up in the age of grunge where thinness in male bodies was cool in a way that has traditionally been the body builder-style physique. I remember being conflicted. I wanted to be really muscly and thin and taller than I was.\u201d\nHis book is one of a growing number that attempt to tackle the problem through fiction for a younger audience. Pollen hopes that his can inject a bit more positivity into the debate. \u201cMy message is a hopeful one \u2026 Most people recover from eating disorders.

        "content": "Investigative reporter broke the story of the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, which Elliott Abrams is accused of whitewashing\nWhen new congresswoman Ilhan Omar used a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing to grill the Trump administration\u2019s new special envoy to Venezuela, Washington stopped and watched.\nThose on the left, particularly those opposed to Trump\u2019s Venezuela policy, praised Omar\u2019s performance. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that it \u201cfelt like justice\u201d watching a Somali refugee question Elliott Abrams.\nAbrams was a key player in the Reagan administration in the 1980s when it propped up the El Salvadoran government and then covered up reports of the El Salvadoran army massacring its own people.\nOthers defended him as a dedicated public servant, with commentator Max Boot describing Omar\u2019s questioning as a \u201cbotched interrogation\u201d that \u201cgot just about everything wrong\u201d.\nOne person watching the exchange with interest was Raymond Bonner, the former New York Times reporter who, along with Alma Guillermoprieto of the Washington Post, broke the story of the El Mozote massacre.\nThe El Mozote massacre was one of several atrocities that occurred at the hands of the El Salvadoran government in 1981 in the eastern province of Moraz\u00e1n, which led to the deaths of roughly 800 people, including children just days old, many after being tortured and raped.\nThe administration, including Abrams who was assistant secretary of state for human rights, quickly dismissed the reports. Abrams claimed Bonner\u2019s reporting was communist propaganda and insisted \u201cthe administration\u2019s record in El Salvador is one of fabulous achievement.\u201d\nBonner now lives half a world away from El Salvador and Washington \u2013 in Sydney, Australia, where he owns and runs a bookshop.\nIn January, Trump announced that Abrams would take the role of special representative to Venezuela, a country suffering from food shortages and hyper-inflation. The US has condemned Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as a tyrant and recognised the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s president. Trump has issued stark warnings to the Venezuelan military if it continues to stand with Maduro\u2019s government.\nBonner has concerns about Abrams\u2019 appointment.\n\u201cI would think, given his track record, given his history, is this the person who should be appointed to a very sensitive foreign policy position?\u201d he says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting him in a foreign policy job in Latin America, ostensibly to overthrow a government. I guess he\u2019ll do a good job if he just does the opposite of what he did in El Salvador which was to prop up a government that shouldn\u2019t have been propped up, now they want to overthrow a government and establish democracy.\u201d\nBonner is sceptical that Trump himself had much to do with Abrams\u2019 appointment, thinking it likely that the president rubber-stamped a nomination rather than him requesting Abrams personally. He is also wary of any claims that Trump has a carefully plotted out foreign policy (\u201cI think it\u2019s an oxymoron: foreign policy under Trump. I really am not kidding\u201d), but he does think Abrams is a representative who will serve the president well.\n\u201cHe will do Trump\u2019s bidding,\u201d he says. \u201cEl Salvador demonstrates that he will do whatever is necessary to carry out the president\u2019s objective. In El Salvador, it was to prop up what a diplomat called \u2026 a genocidal, nun-killing junta, and in Venezuela it\u2019s to get rid of the government. And just like he lied when necessary, or quote-unquote misled Congress and the public when necessary, he\u2019ll do the same in Venezuela. So he\u2019s the right man for the job if you\u2019re Trump. He\u2019s the right man, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\nBonner says he was pleased Omar went after Abrams\u2019 record, although was less impressed by her performance at the hearing, saying her questioning was \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\u201cSomebody ought to be asking why Elliott Abrams is put in a position of influence. She was right to question his ethical qualifications for this job \u2026 I suppose one of the questions is how does a guy like this hold on?\u201d",

        "content": "Far-right founder of English Defence League repeatedly breached hate speech rules\nTommy Robinson, the far-right founder of the English Defence League, has been permanently banned from Facebook and Instagram for repeatedly breaking policies on hate speech, Facebook said.\nThe company said Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, broke rules that ban public calls for violence against people based on protected characteristics; rules that ban supporting or appearing with organised hate groups; and policies that prevent people from using the site to bully others.\nThe decision to ban Robinson from the social media sites could threaten his ability to reach large audiences. He is already banned from Twitter and the decision to cut him off from Instagram and Facebook will leave him reliant on YouTube as the only major online platform to provide him with a presence.\nIn a blogpost, Facebook said: \u201cWhen ideas and opinions cross the line and amount to hate speech that may create an environment of intimidation and exclusion for certain groups in society \u2013 in some cases with potentially dangerous offline implications \u2013 we take action. Tommy Robinson\u2019s Facebook page has repeatedly broken these standards, posting material that uses dehumanizing language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims. He has also behaved in ways that violate our policies around organized hate.\u201d\nThe ban comes a month after Facebook issued a final written warning against Robinson, warning him that he would be removed from its platform permanently if he continued to break the company\u2019s hate speech policies.\nThat warning had been issued for breaches that included a post calling on people to terrorise and behead those who follow the Qur\u2019an; a post calling on people to \u201cmake war\u201d on Muslims; and multiple videos showing people being bullied.\nFollowing that warning, Robinson did break Facebook\u2019s policies again, it says, through:\nOrganising and participating in events with recognised hate figures or groups, such as Proud Boys and Gavin McInnes\nPublic praise or support for these hate figures and groups\nPublic remarks that include hate speech targeted at a specific group in society\nPublic calls for violence against people based on race, ethnicity or national origin.\nRobinson\u2019s official Facebook page and Instagram profile will be deleted and any future presence on the site will be preemptively barred. It will place Robinson in the same category as other banned personalities such as McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, and the Infowars founder, Alex Jones, meaning that others who allow him access to the site through their own pages or profiles could face disciplinary action themselves.\nFacebook added: \u201cOur public community standards state this sort of speech is not acceptable on Facebook \u2013 and when we become aware of it, we remove it as quickly as we can. Our rules also make clear that individuals and organisations that are engaged in \u2018organised hate\u2019 are not allowed on the platform, and that praise or support for these figures and groups is also banned. This is true regardless of the ideology they espouse.\u201d\nIn the time between Facebook announcing the deletions and them taking effect 24 minutes later, Robinson posted a new video to his Instagram account, accusing the company of working together with the media to censor him.\n\u201cIf this isn\u2019t the evidence that you needed, headlines now from the Guardian, the Guardian, before I\u2019ve been told, so they\u2019re all working together with the media, they have deleted me from Facebook and apparently I\u2019m being deleted from Instagram. I can still make this video at the minute, but I\u2019m being deleted.\u201d He appealed to his supporters follow him to his personal website, saying: \u201cWe have to fight this censorship.\u201d\nThe founder of the EDL thrives on media attention and has often defined himself in opposition to mainstream news outlets, portraying himself as the victim of a smear campaign designed to keep his views off mainstream outlets.\nThis has proved to be an effective tactic, with his social media videos on supposed mainstream bias often reaching more viewers than the original news broadcasts.\nTom Watson, the shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said: \u201cI welcome Facebook\u2019s decision to remove Tommy Robinson pages under their \u2018organised hate\u2019 policy. But for far too long this violent thug\u2019s hate-spewing, anti-Islamist tirades were given a platform by Facebook. Today\u2019s decision comes far too late. The public interest demands an end to laissez-faire regulation, so we can create a place where reasonable debate can take place without trolls, extremists and racist thugs seeking to damage and undermine society. That requires an independent social media regulator with teeth.\u201d\nMainstream outlets have struggled to deal with Robinson. When he was interviewed by Sky News last year, Robinson responded by uploading an unedited video of the discussion, which became an online success and was shared far more widely online than the original interview.\nRobinson adopted a similar tactic with the BBC\u2019s Panorama, which is investigating the far-right activist. Two weeks ago, Robinson agreed to be interviewed by the programme, only to turn the tables on reporter John Sweeney by revealing he had sent an associate undercover to film the BBC reporter.\nHe then played Sweeney a series of secretly recorded clips in which the BBC journalist appeared to say that white working-class people rarely appeared on Newsnight. These awkward interactions were swiftly packaged by Robinson\u2019s team for distribution on Facebook, where they have attracted millions of views, culminating in the activist holding a protest outside the BBC\u2019s Salford offices last Saturday.\nSeveral other accounts were removed on Tuesday, including one belonging to former Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam, prompting accusations of censorship by Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president.. Facebook said Kassam\u2019s deletion was a mistake and quickly reinstated his profile.",

        "content": "Government officials hold talks after they realise UK has shortage of the right pallets \nThe government is holding talks with distributors after realising that the UK has a dire shortage of the \u201cright sort\u201d of pallets to import and export goods in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will on Tuesday hold meetings with distribution industry representatives about how to keep household goods moving to and from supermarkets if the UK crashes out of the EU next month.\nIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal the overwhelming majority of wooden pallets, used to transport a vast range of consumer goods from breakfast cereal to pet food, beer and chocolate, will not meet strict EU rules designed to stop the spread of bark beetles and other pests.\nIf the pallets are prevented from transiting between the UK and the 27-country bloc, the millions of tonnes of goods they carry will not be able to be transported which could potentially lead to food shortages. More than 3m pallets move between the UK and EU every month.\nThe UK government has told distributors that all timber packaging, including pallets, destined for the EU countries after a no-deal Brexit must be heat-treated or fumigated to comply with International Standards For Phytosanitary (Regarding Plants) Measures 15 (ISPM 15). At present pallets moving between EU member states, including the UK, are exempt from the ISPM 15 standard. Industry experts said fewer than a third of the pallets used for EU-UK trade comply with the standard.\n\u201cIn the event of no deal, all WPM [wood packaging material] moving between the UK and the EU must meet ISPM15 international standards by undergoing heat treatment and marking,\u201d Defra said in an official notice last week. \u201cAll WPM may be subject to official checks either upon or after entry to the EU.\u201d\nThe notice sparked concern among distributors and hauliers who asked for a meeting with officials. Business Insider first reported details of the meeting due to be held on Tuesday.\nA spokesperson for Defra said: \u201cWe have been meeting weekly with representatives from the food and drink industry for many months to help prepare for all scenarios as we leave the EU.\n\u201cAs part of those meetings we have discussed a range of issues relating to the import and export of our goods, including pallets. We have already committed to retaining our current pallet import approaches post-exit, and we hope the EU will confirm that it will reciprocate our commitment.\u201d\nChris Hillaby, the managing director of Shaw Pallets, a Huddersfield-based pallet producer, said the issue was \u201cone of those really nasty things that Brexit has thrown up\u201d.\n\u201cA global initiative commenced over 15 years ago within the forestry and timber packaging market has been focused on stopping an invasion of plant pests that can prove very damaging to our indigenous timber stocks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAround five years earlier, it had become apparent in the US that plant pests could be transported in lower-grade softwoods, which were used in some items of timber packaging where the insects, such as the Asian long-horned beetle, could sometimes be found under sections of bark on the timber.\n\u201cTo prevent such trends the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreed that all timber packaging should be heat treated at source to a core temperature of 56C and sustained for at least 30 minutes as this had been scientifically proven way to eradicate such threats \u2013 the treatment standard being called ISPM15.\u201d\nThe EU is exempt from the WTO rules. But Hillaby said: \u201cShould the UK not secure an acceptable Brexit deal, the country will of course revert to WTO rules for export and import, which will call for timber packaging to be heat treated for all cross-border shipments. While Defra has at the current time indicated that it will not implement rigorous checks on imported goods from the EU, there has been little in the way of a similarly pragmatic response from the EU itself.\u201d\nHillaby said the vast majority of consumer goods delivered to supermarkets are transported on rented pallets and \u201cvirtually none of these pallets are presently heat treated/ISPM15 compliant \u2013 so if there is an increase in cross-border checks as a result of Brexit some of these shipments could easily be adversely affected.\u201d",

        "content": "You have been reacting to the news Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk, has died at the age of 64\nSpirit of Eden is simply brilliant and one of the top ten albums of all time for me. I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius.\nAnybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a \u201chit\u201d anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today\u2019s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio and/or MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. Leon Depope\nIt\u2019s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis disappeared from public life in 1998, and I certainly never met him, but I\u2019m heartbroken.\nHe said (and I\u2019m very much paraphrasing here) that he\u2019d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that\u2019s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days.\nEven if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he\u2019s not around any more. So effortly blessed. Andrew Samoyed\nIf there\u2019s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre.\nWhat an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there\u2019s no such regrets here.\nFarewell Mark, you\u2019ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. jesusjuice89\nWe\u2019ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk\u2019s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius.\nLiving in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. Anhaga\nTo this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. thegreatdargini\nI\u2019m struggling on this one; so unexpected. I always had this feeling he\u2019d just emerge again one day, drop an album \u2013 no fuss, no build-up \u2026 and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved.\nThanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I\u2019ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. Mitch44\nI first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I\u2019d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with \u2013 perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis\u2019s wonderful solo album.\nSome say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They\u2019re good, but they\u2019re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it\u2019s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he\u2019d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius.

        "content": "Family-friendly releases draw strong half-term crowds, while Liam Neeson thriller Cold Pursuit receives a lukewarm reception\nThe final days of the half-term holiday saw strong performances from family films at the UK box office. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part led the way, declining a slim 2% from the previous weekend, and adding \u00a36.6m for the seven days ending Sunday night. UK total after three weeks is a decent \u00a314m.\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which was 1% up on the previous weekend, added \u00a34.4m over the seven days, and is now at \u00a315.9m. Lego is closing the gap with Dragon, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess which title will achieve the bigger UK total.\nAfter its disappointing start, The Kid Who Would Be King recovered lost ground, rising 4% from its opening session. Total after 10 days remains a mediocre \u00a32.6m. Distributor 20th Century Fox might have hoped for better with this title in its home market, given a reported production budget of $59m. Worldwide box office is $26m so far.\nAlso in the Top 5 are Instant Family (down for the weekend by a relatively slim 16%) and Alita: Battle Angel (down 39%).\nRevenge tale Cold Pursuit, starring Liam Neeson, was the highest new entry (in sixth place) but took an uninspiring \u00a3631,000 from 417 cinemas, yielding a site average of \u00a31,514.\nNeeson was last seen on UK cinema screens in a supporting role in Widows. His last lead role was in The Commuter, which began in January 2018 with \u00a31.55m from 472 sites (\u00a31.6m including previews). Cold Pursuit has begun with less than half that amount. Worldwide total is $35m so far.\nLanding a couple of places below Cold Pursuit in the chart, despite a release into a few dozen more cinemas, is the biographical drama about the early years of crusading lawyer and future US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The film, which stars Felicity Jones and Armie Hammer, began with a flat \u00a3459,000 from 452 cinemas, delivering a site average just above \u00a31,000.\nOn the Basis of Sex attracted mostly three-star reviews, which were not enthusiastic enough to position this film as a must-see for audiences already sated by awards-season titles such as The Favourite, Green Book, Vice, Mary Queen of Scots, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Colette and Stan & Ollie.\nOscar foreign language film nominees Cold War, Shoplifters and Roma all reached UK cinemas last year. The fourth of the nominated titles, Capernaum, arrived on Friday, beginning with a decent \u00a385,100 from 48 sites (\u00a3141,000 including previews). Director Nadine Labaki was previously in UK cinemas in 2012 with Where Do We Go Now?, which achieved a lifetime total of \u00a391,700. Before that, her Caramel began in May 2008 with \u00a3104,000 from 46 cinemas (\u00a3123,000 including previews), on its way to a total just below \u00a3500,000.\nThe fifth title nominated in the foreign language category at the Oscars, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\u2019s Never Look Away, is not yet slated for UK release.\nFor the seventh weekend in a row, the UK market is down on the equivalent session from 2018, this time by 42%. The month of January was 18% down on January 2018, and the numbers do not look any more encouraging for February. Cinema operators are counting the days until the arrival of Disney\u2019s Captain Marvel on 8 March. Until then, hopes are pinned on Fighting With My Family, a comedy-drama about a real-life wrestling family written and directed by Stephen Merchant, and with Dwayne Johnson playing himself in a supporting role. Keira Knightley leads the cast of The Aftermath, set in Hamburg after the second world war. Sky Cinema offers high-concept thriller Serenity, written and directed by Steven Knight, with a cast led by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway.\n1.

Transport for London (TfL) had refused to renew Uber\u2019s licence when it expired in September 2017, citing safety concerns.\nArbuthnot since said she would not hear any further cases involving Uber after reports emerged alleging financial connections between the firm and her husband, Lord Arbuthnot.\nAt a hearing in London earlier this month, UCG lawyers argued that the judge should have checked for any potential conflicts of interest.\nHowever, their case was dismissed by the lord chief justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Supperstone on Tuesday.\nBurnett said in his ruling: \u201cHaving ascertained all the circumstances bearing on the suggestion that the judge was biased, we consider that those circumstances would not lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased in this case.\u201d\nHe said that the \u201ctenuous connections unearthed\u201d by UCG fell \u201cwell short of evidence that would begin to give a fair-minded observer even pause for thought\u201d.\nUber has put in an application for costs, which could see drivers having to find another \u00a3150-200k on top of their own legal costs, including \u00a348k costs for TfL. The action was brought after a crowdfunding campaign among black cab drivers.\nThe London Taxi Drivers Association, an interested party, will also be liable for 10-20% of the costs.\nUber\u2019s licence renewal had originally been rejected by TfL over concerns such as a failure to report allegations of assaults on passengers to police, how it conducted background checks on drivers, and how the app had been modified in the US to thwart regulators.\nBut after pledges to reform from chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, and the implementation of safeguards such as a 24-hour phone helpline, Uber did enough to convince Arbuthnot that the firm had changed sufficiently to give it a short licence, with stringent conditions \u2013 although she remained critical of the firm in her ruling. The licence is due to expire in September.",

I would love to see them produce change. Sadly, the dice are weighted against them.\nThe major thing the kids have stacked against them is the power that comes from vast quantities of money. The major business organisations and the very rich really don\u2019t want to have anything disturb the capitalist status quo. It is claimed that we don\u2019t have bribery and corruption in western society but I struggle to see how \u201ccontributions\u201d to political war chests have any other purpose than ensuring that the payers get heard. It\u2019s effectively a big business protection racket.\nGo, Guardian, for publicising this David and Goliath battle!Keith EdwardsOmokoroa, New Zealand\n Your article on student protests offers yet another excuse for skipping school. It further shows the power of propaganda, in that schoolchildren, ignorant about the machinations of politics at the best of times, miraculously find themselves cognisant of this most difficult of topics: climate change.\nIn your story there was also a passing slight at the current powerbrokers for failing to safeguard the new generation\u2019s world. But the present institutions are run by the greener-than-green hippie generation, who are now billionaire hedge-fund entrepreneurs, bankers, lawyers, organised crime kingpins and politicians.\nSo the school pupils have nothing to fear, as they too will join the ranks of the objects of their fury.Sam NejadGeraldton, Western Australia\nWe must deepen our understanding of nature\nIt is shocking that the \u201cprecipitous\u201d decline of insects should be treated as news (15 February) and that we have only now had \u201cthe first global scientific review\u201d. It beggars belief that this story emerged because one person happened to revisit a tropical habitat he had worked in 40 years ago. It is a tragedy that we know more about outer space than we do of Earth.\nWe not only need to divert investment from the military into sustainable development, but we also need to build a global observatory to deepen our understanding of the way human and natural systems interact. This is not a scientific challenge, but rather a political one. To deny access to this knowledge is to connive at the destruction of the future. Neil BlackshawBarbizon, France\nPrivate sponsorship of refugees is happening\nOne of your letter writers (Why don\u2019t we let citizens sponsor refugees? Reply, 15 February) may be interested to know that Canada has been allowing private sponsorship of refugees since the Vietnamese boat people crisis. At this point, close to half of all refugees to Canada are privately sponsored. Research suggests that privately sponsored refugees are more likely to be successfully integrated than their government-sponsored counterparts.\nPrivate sponsorship is one of the reasons Canadians seem more inclined to accept refugees than many countries. It is a model that should be adopted by any right-thinking country.Jane McCallDelta, BC, Canada \nShock of hard Brexit is something to avoid\nNesrine Malik hits the nail on the head in her article Britain needs a day of reckoning (22 February), though I find it hard to accept her conclusion that this entails the shock of Brexit at any cost.\nBritain has long suffered from the delusion that \u201cwe won two world wars, now we deserve the fruits of those victories\u201d. If this is the long-awaited wake-up call, faced with the question \u201ccan we go it alone?\u201d then it is a waking nightmare: no nation, not even the giants America and China, can go it alone for very long in the global arena. The web of trade, politics, migration and climate change requires cooperation at every level, even to maintain the status quo, let alone bring about the changes necessary for our survival.\nSadly, Britain lacks a leader with the courage to grasp the nettle.Noel BirdBoreen Point, Queensland, Australia\nWhere do these people garage their cars?\nThe article The High Line, on skinny super-tall skyscrapers in New York (15 February), was fascinating.

The lifeless humpback, which was about eight metres (26ft) long, was found in thick shrubs and brush.\n\u201cWe imagine it was floating and the tide took it into the mangrove,\u201d Renata Emin, the president of Bicho D\u2019\u00c1gua, told local media. \u201cThe question is, what was a humpback whale doing in the month of February on the northern coast of Brazil? It\u2019s unusual.\u201d\nA group of biologists examined the carcass over the weekend to figure out how the whale died. The group is expecting a postmortem report within 10 days. \u201cWe are collecting information, identifying marks on the body, to determine if it was trapped in a net or hit by a boat,\u201d Emin said.\nConservationists from the Bicho d\u2019\u00c1gua Institute suggest the whale could have been separated from its mother before being forced ashore by high tides during a storm. Other researchers have speculated that the humpback may have swum towards the beach looking for food and suffocated after consuming large amounts of plastic.\nGovernment officials told reporters the whale had been dead for several days. Though the whale was half the size of a full-grown adult humpback, it was still too large and in too remote an area to be entirely removed.\nPeter Evans, the director of the Sea Watch Foundation, which monitors whales and dolphins off Britain\u2019s coasts, said incidents like these were rare. He said humpback whales were often found in coastal waters and were known to migrate great distances. South American humpbacks breed around the equator and then migrate towards the Antarctic to feed.\n\u201cThis calf probably got separated from its mother, maybe its mother had died, in the southern summer, and then wandered about trying to find food. The idea that it was killed by ingesting plastic would need some evidence first to support it. It seems to me more likely that it simply starved to death. If they do a postmortem examination, we will have a clearer idea,\u201d Evans said.",

But how will the votes play out?\nThe prime minister has said she will bring her deal back to the House of Commons by 12 March with new assurances from the European Union about the temporary nature of the Irish border backstop.\nMay said the government was seeking \u201clegal changes that are required to guarantee that the Northern Ireland backstop cannot endure indefinitely\u201d. These could be attached to the withdrawal agreement and included in new assurances in the political declaration on the future relationship, which is not legally binding.\nThe attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is to visit Brussels this week to continue negotiations.\nIt is still possible that Eurosceptic MPs could vote down May\u2019s deal unless she reopens the text of the withdrawal agreement to remove the backstop entirely and replace it with alternative arrangements, something the EU has said it will not agree to.\nIt is also unclear whether the prime minister\u2019s supply and confidence partners, the Democratic Unionist party, are prepared to back the changes May is seeking. If she fails to win the backing of both groups, it is likely her deal will be voted down again.\nMay said on Tuesday that if the government had not won a meaningful vote by 12 March it would table a motion for a vote the following day, asking MPs if they support leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.\n\u201cThe United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this house for that outcome,\u201d the prime minister said.\nIt is unclear how the government would whip on such a motion, though dozens of cabinet ministers and ministers would be likely to resign and rebel if they were whipped to support a no-deal Brexit. If the government whips against the motion or gives a free vote, only be a small number of MPs are likely to vote in favour of no deal.\nMay has also committed to tabling another neutral motion on the future of the negotiations, which MPs will be able to amend, similar to the one being tabled this week.\nIf MPs reject a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister will give them a vote on 14 March on whether the government should \u201cseek a short, limited extension to article 50\u201d which could then be negotiated with the EU. Should MPs vote for the extension, the government would legislate to change the exit date.\nMay said her pledge to hold these votes would fit the timescale laid out in Yvette Cooper\u2019s private member\u2019s bill aimed at preventing no deal. Some ministers had threatened to resign in order to back the Labour MP\u2019s bill.\nThe prime minister said she did not want article 50 to be extended: \u201cOur absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.\u201d\nShe also expressed concerns that an extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections and that a short extension \u201cwould almost certainly have to be a one-off.\u201d\n\u201cIf we had not taken part in the European parliament elections, it would be extremely difficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper cliff edge in a few months\u2019 time,\u201d she said.\nAgain, it is unclear how the prime minister would whip on that motion. If she whipped her cabinet and ministers in favour of extension, it would be likely to prompt resignations.\nIt is likely, however, that the motion extending article 50 would pass, given it would be certain to have substantial support from both the Conservatives and the opposition.\nParliament would be in deadlock, though it is possible MPs would bring forward their own options \u2013 for a second referendum or revoking article 50 \u2013 in order to avoid the default option, which is to leave the EU with no deal on March 29.",

He said the UK was prepared to use lethal force to deter countries that flouted international law, in an apparent reference to Chinese expansion.\nIn a clear response to Williamson, the Chinese ambassador writes: \u201cIn an age when hot and cold wars should be long gone, resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy from the grave, as this certain politician did, was anachronistic and risks disrupting the progress of China-UK relations.\u201d\nIt is understood that a trade trip to China, due to be undertaken by the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, was cancelled in the wake of the offence caused by the Williamson speech.\nThe defence secretary\u2019s remarks were also sharply criticised by George Osborne, the former chancellor and a firm advocate of a close British-China relationship. Osborne described the remarks as \u201cgunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind\u201d.\nThere is a lively debate inside the UK government about whether the UK needs to take a more combative approach towards China, including at the United Nations and in Africa.\nThe Chinese ambassador sets out in his article the clear parameters of a future relationship, saying: \u201cChina and the UK must resist this disruption and keep the larger picture in mind.\u201d\nCalling for the two countries to act in harmony, he writes: \u201cChina and the UK rely on mutual respect and mutual trust to keep us in tune and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation.\u201d\nWithout mentioning Brexit, he also points out the potential price of disharmony for the UK, saying: \u201cChina is the fastest growing market for UK exports and the UK\u2019s second largest trading partner outside the EU.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cAn open, innovative and inclusive UK is an internationally recognised brand name, and I hope that the UK will continue to provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies including Huawei. This will win more respect, trust and cheers for a \u2018global Britain\u2019.\u201d\nThe US is leading a global campaign to keep the Chinese-owned firm Huawei out of the superfast 5G network, but so far UK intelligence chiefs have said the risk posed by the Chinese accessing the phone network is manageable.\nAustralia, New Zealand and the US \u2013 all close UK security partners \u2013 have decided to exclude Huawei, fearing China will use the access to conduct both industrial and political espionage. The National Cyber Security Centre said on Monday that it had \u201ca unique oversight and understanding of Huawei engineering and cybersecurity\u201d.\nThe ambassador also seeks to position China as an advocate of multilateralism, in unstated contrast to America. Urging the UK to \u201creject the chaotic disruption of rigidity and narrow-mindedness\u201d, he claims: \u201cBoth China and the UK support multilateralism, free trade and rule-based international trade system. Both are permanent members of the UN security council and countries with global influence. We have a responsibility to oppose unilateralism and protectionism and build an open world economy.\u201d\nA Ministry of Defence source stressed that Williamson\u2019s speech had been signed off by Downing Street and the Foreign Office, and he made no specific mention of the South China Sea in the speech, only to the Pacific.\nAsked about the Chinese ambassador\u2019s comments, Williamson said it was important to work with other nations in the region \u201cin order to uphold international law\u201d.\nAdditional reporting by Caroline Davies",

We are therefore facing what I would call a crisis of perception,\u201d he told an industry audience in London.\nHe said: \u201cBecause it [the crisis] threatens our industry\u2019s very relevance, it puts our ability to supply ample, reliable and affordable energy to billions around the world at risk, which in turn risks their energy security.\u201d\nNasser claimed the idea that oil demand would soon peak, which most authorities think will happen in the next two decades, was an exaggerated theory.\nSaudi Arabia is one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers, with only Russia and the US on a par, and it plans to increase its output in the coming decade.\nNasser\u2019s speech did not explicitly mention climate change but he said one of the remedies to the sector\u2019s image problem was to understand society wanted clean energy and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Asked what the Paris climate agreement meant for Saudi Aramco, he boasted that the company would become a \u201cglobal leader\u201d in another fossil fuel \u2013 gas.\nHe also said Saudi Aramco would invest more in petrochemicals but that it would not yet be entering the renewables market because the Gulf kingdom was already investing in solar power.\nNasser said that if the firm stopped investing now, the world would face a shortfall in oil supply in five years\u2019 time that would lead to higher oil prices \u2013 reinforcing a perception the industry was profiteering. Saudi Aramco is reportedly the world\u2019s most profitable company.\nBob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, said he agreed with the Saudi oil boss. \u201cThe world is driven by myths and not facts,\u201d he said.\nDudley said: \u201cI think we have a particular challenge with [the perception of] energy.

PSA will relaunch Peugeot in North America after almost 30 years, as well as launching Citro\u00ebn in India.\nPSA\u2019s Opel\u2013Vauxhall business reported its first annual profits in 20 years after a major cost-cutting plan following its \u00a31.9bn purchase from US carmaker General Motors in 2017. During General Motors\u2019 ownership the company made $19bn in accumulated losses, but Opel-Vauxhall made a profit of \u20ac859m in 2018.\nOpel-Vauxhall runs two factories in the UK, at Luton in Bedfordshire, and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which together employ about 2,300 people. While the Luton plant will start production of the new Vivaro van this year, a future investment decision for Ellesmere Port is expected to come after the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU after Brexit is decided.\nAt the start of 2018 unions had feared that Ellesmere Port would close as Tavares, known for cost cutting at Renault before joining PSA, made hundreds of job cuts at Opel-Vauxhall.\nTavares gave no indication that PSA has reached a decision on what part British plants would play in future production, including the UK in the possible contenders for production of new Opel-Vauxhall models.\nHowever, he also gave a stark warning that British factories could close if trade becomes less favourable with the EU after Brexit.\n\u201cWe can go on the dark side, say, well, perhaps you have to shut down plants and things like that. Well, if we have to make unpopular decisions we will,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut on the other side let\u2019s not forget that we have the Vauxhall brand. The Vauxhall brand is warm to the hearts of UK consumers and we may have also the opposite opportunity, to be the survivor of the automotive industry in the UK.\u201d\nTavares\u2019s comments come at a pivotal moment for the British car industry, following the decisions of Nissan to revoke a decision to make its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland and of fellow Japanese carmaker Honda\u2019s plan to end production in Swindon in 2021, at a cost of at least 7,000 jobs. Jaguar Land Rover and Ford have also announced thousands of job cuts this year.",

There is no signal in it, except that it is part of normal contingency planning.\u201d\nAbout 100 banks and building societies would be eligible to access up to \u00a3300bn of cash for six months in return for high-grade mortgages and other financial assets, Carney said.\n\u201cWe are not seeing any liquidity stresses in the market,\u201d he said, adding that commercial banks seeking central bank funds in recent auctions were only paying a couple of basis points, or fractions of a per cent, above the 0.75% bank rate.\nHowever, the announcement emphasised that Threadneedle Street was concerned about a no-deal Brexit and the potential for a credit crunch to bring the banking system to its knees as it did during the 2008 financial crash.\nIn recent months Carney has pushed European and US regulators to agree contingency arrangements to cope with a no-deal Brexit to make sure financial markets were able to continue trading without interruption.\nOn Monday, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed that firms working in the US and the UK would continue to meet the requirements required to operate in both countries, even if the UK exited the EU without a deal.\nCity analysts said the move would protect London from losing trillions of pounds of complex financial derivatives business after Brexit.\nCarney said the UK\u2019s banking sector holds around \u00a31tn in cash or similarly liquid assets, four times the level ahead of the 2008 crash.\nBut he emphasised his concern at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, saying: \u201cIf we come back in May and there\u2019s no deal I guarantee you we will come back with a lower GDP forecast.\u201d\nHe warned that delaying the UK\u2019s exit was not as good for the economy as reaching a deal. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between an extension of article 50, even a long extension, and an agreement with a transition to a known end stage.\n\u201cWherever we\u2019re headed, it would serve the economy well to have a transition period to that new world, so that people knew soon where they\u2019re headed, businesses could reorganise their affairs and get ready for this new world, and government could finish its tasks.\u201d\nBookmakers have marked down the possibility of Britain leaving the EU on 29 March to just 14% after Labour\u2019s move to block Theresa May\u2019s deal by favouring \u2013 if the party\u2019s Brexit plan failed to gain a majority \u2013 a second referendum.\nEarlier this month Carney questioned the path of globalisation, which he argued was dividing nations and causing enough political stress to hamper global growth.\nHe said Brexit was an acid test of whether it was possible to reshape globalisation in a way that offered the benefits of trade while allaying public fears about the erosion of democracy.",

The sanctions also govern the import of luxury goods and so customs was completely justified in unloading that container.\u201d\nKim, who was educated in Switzerland, is known to have a taste for the high life. Last year, it was claimed he had has spent more than $4bn (\u00a33bn) on importing luxury products from China since taking power in 2011.\nHis family is said to have imported a seaplane, musical instruments, watches and furs, with luxury items accounting for 17.8% of North Korea\u2019s total imports from China in 2017, according to a South Korean analysis.\nKim arrived in Hanoi in his armoured train on Tuesday, ahead of his second meeting with Trump. He had travelled for two and a half days, covering 2,800 miles, although his precise route has not been disclosed.\nThe meeting comes eight months after a summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, which failed to produce concrete results on a path to denuclearisation.",

        "content": "Family notebook appears to show that both of the notorious Depression-era outlaws turned their hand to verse\nAn old green notebook believed to contain poetry written by the notorious outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow has been put up for auction by Barrow\u2019s nephew.\nThe pair, who went on a 21-month crime spree robbing banks, gas stations and restaurants at the height of the US\u2019s Great Depression, were shot and killed in a police ambush in Louisiana in 1934. Barrow was 24, and Parker, who had teamed up with Barrow on his release from prison years earlier, was 23. The pair became even more famous when they were played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in the 1967 film, Bonnie and Clyde.\nParker was known to have written poetry \u2013 Jeff Guinn\u2019s biography of the outlaws, Go Down Together, recounts how she wrote verses including The Story of Suicide Sal, about a naive country girl who falls for a man who lures her into crime, while in prison. But the notebook, which was among a collection of items belonging to Barrow\u2019s older sister Nell May Barrow and put up for auction by her son, reveals that Barrow also tried his hand as a poet. According to Heritage Auctions, the \u201cyear book\u201d was used by Parker and Barrow to write poetry about \u201ctheir life of crime and doomed efforts to elude capture\u201d.\nOne of the poems, written in pencil and then cut out and kept in an envelope labelled \u201cwritten by Bonnie\u201d, is the verse that Parker is best known for: The Story of Bonnie and Clyde, which opens: \u201cYou\u2019ve read the story of \u2018Jesse James\u2019, / Of how he lived and died. / If you\u2019re still in need / Of something to read, / Here\u2019s the story of \u2018Bonnie and Clyde.\u2019\u201d\nIt ends, presciently: \u201cSome day they\u2019ll go down together / they\u2019ll bury them side by side / to few it\u2019ll be grief / to the law a relief / but it\u2019s death for Bonnie and Clyde.\u201d\nAfter the pair were killed in 1934, Parker\u2019s mother Emma and Barrow\u2019s sister Nell wrote a biography of their famous relatives, Fugitives. It featured a copy of the poem, and an explanation of its provenance: \u201cBonnie gave me the poem that night, \u2018The Story of Bonnie and Clyde\u2019. I shall present it here because it gives a little of the inside angle of the case \u2026 They would be back in two weeks, they promised, but in two weeks they were dead.\u201d\nThe year book also includes a 13-stanza poem, written across four pages, ostensibly by Barrow, which opens: \u201cBonnie s Just Written a poem / the Story of Bonnie & Clyde. So / I will try my hand at Poetry / With her riding by my side.\u201d\nIt continues: \u201cWe donte want to hurt anney one / but we have to Steal to eat. / and if it\u2019s a shoot out to / to live that\u2019s the way it / will have to bee. / We have kidnapped some / people. And tied them to a tree / but not so tight that after we / were gone tha could not get / themselves free. / We are going home tomorrow / to look in on the folks. We will / meet then out near Grape Vine / if the Laws donte get there / first. / Now that\u2019s not as good as / Bonnies. So I guess I / Will call it a flop- / But please God Just one / moore visit before we are / Put on the spot.\u201d\n\u201cBoth poems are riddled with spelling errors that are characteristic of Clyde,\u201d said Heritage Auctions, which will auction the book in April. \u201cThis poem and the subsequent one signed by Clyde are redolent of the jargon of \u2018gangster-ese\u2019 which Depression-era Americans were inculcated with through the media of films, radio and pulp fiction.\u201d\nThe auction house said it had attempted to pin down the poems\u2019 definitive authorship; although there are similarities between the handwriting in the book and the few examples that exist elsewhere, it said they are \u201cnot conclusive enough for us to definitively authenticate the handwriting\u201d. But both Parker\u2019s mother and Barrow\u2019s sister, \u201cboth of whom received countless messages and letters from the pair \u2026 identify the Clyde poem as being in his handwriting\u201d, and \u201creference the Bonnie poem as something she gave to them in her final visit\u201d.\n\u201cBonnie is known for having written poetry. The vernacular of both poems is consistent with the source and time frame. The spelling errors, or lack of them, is also consistent with the attribution. Plus, due weight should be placed on the provenance, which is impeccable,\u201d it said.",

        "content": "Talk Talk\u2019s singer was a master of melancholy and reinvention whose tender voice allowed us to vanish into ourselves\n Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk, dies at age 64\n Alexis Petridis: \u2018The reluctant pop star who redefined rock\u2019\nIt\u2019s that time of year when the lengthening days start to fill with a new kind of light and undeniable signs of new life. The first gold of a daffodil; the fresh surprise of warmth on the neck; a bluer sky. And the first moment this feeling comes, usually in February or March, I play a song from an album which is a dear favourite of mine. \u201cHere she comes\u201d, it begins. \u201cSilent in her sound / Here she comes / Fresh upon the ground.\u201d\nThis week in 1986, Talk Talk\u2019s The Colour of Spring entered the album charts at No 8, sitting between Jonathan King\u2019s Entertainment USA and Go West\u2019s Bangs and Crashes like a rare butterfly. A record by an art-rock band whose talents had previously promised stadium hits, it bore one of their perennials Life\u2019s What You Make It, but it also included April 5th \u2013 the song by which Talk Talk began to disappear.\nIt begins with soft, synthesised percussion, piano, slight guitar strings, a breath of woodwind. Then comes the gentle arrival of a season, and the soft, slow approach of promise as the album\u2019s title arrives in its lyric. There is \u201claughter in her kiss\u201d. For \u201cbirth she lives\u201d. \u201cLet me breathe,\u201d Hollis sings, as we hear a new band being born.\nTalk Talk\u2019s fourth and fifth albums, 1988\u2019s Spirit of Eden and 1991\u2019s Laughing Stock, took this vanishing act further, throwing away any memory of their arrival in pop in 1982 with the synth-pop clamour of Today. (Talk Talk had emerged around the same time as similar masters of epic melancholy, Tears for Fears, but had done the opposite to them: peeled away the layers, rather than added to them.) Songs such as Desire, Taphead and After the Flood were impossibly beautiful and sublimely bleak \u2013 not like songs at all, in many senses. Instead, they were long, meditative, immersive experiences \u2013 extended journeys into the possibilities of ambient sound, influenced not by what surrounded their makers, but by the spaces between; of the improvised nature of jazz and modern classical composition, as well as strange, oblique poetry.\nThis was music that kept disappearing into the fog. Talk Talk conjured ideas and delicate images like pointillist painters: \u201cDesire / Whispered, spoken / In time / Rivers, oceans\u201d.\nYou had to stand back and take it in as a whole, or be brave and enter it, letting its misty weather hold your bones. It created the perfect atmospheric spaces for the 90s foundations of post-rock and trip-hop. It also allowed us to vanish into ourselves.\nIn this mix, Mark Hollis\u2019 voice crystallised its intent, and it did so in a peculiarly understated way. The high notes of his voice are both moving and strangely fragile: the voice of the edgy outsider in the classroom, who still manages, somehow, to touch you with his tenderness. His is \u201cone of the great un-rock voices,\u201d said Rob Young of Wire magazine in 1998, conducting Hollis\u2019 last UK interview, to accompany his only solo, stunning eponymous album.\nIts oblique chords and acoustic treatments support a voice that seems to shift delicately on the air, and it begins with a song called The Colour of Spring, a brief hint to his past, which has always moved me. \u201c[His voice is] all whisper and no scream,\u201d Young writes beautifully in that interview. \u201cAt times, the voice is little more than a thin parting of the air.\u201d But Hollis\u2019 is also a voice strangely blessed of its own quiet confidence. It invites you embrace his inner silence, as well as our own.\nAfter that solo album, Hollis seemed to disappear too. Or rather, he simply left the industry whirlpool behind \u2013 like Kate Bush did between The Red Shoes and Aerial \u2013 to get on with real life. He became a father in 1986, and talked in his rare interviews about the importance of being a good parent. He was also well-known in the industry for being a stickler, never wanting to release anything that wasn\u2019t absolutely right. He played piano beautifully on UNKLE\u2019s Psyence Fiction album, for example, but wanted his name taken off the credits afterwards. The only thing that appeared after his solo album was suitably odd: a one-minute instrumental in 2012 for a Kelsey Grammer TV series. Called ARB Section 1, its keening clarinet and discordant synthesised voices suggest a recognisable soul musically approaching new avenues. He kept such riches, fittingly, to himself.\nA few years ago, I attempted to find him. I drafted an idea for a documentary, to prompt him from his hiding place and somehow make him appear again. I listened to endless old interviews, glorying in his thick London accent. I found out through friends where he lived, in a thoroughly ordinary suburban place. I found out he had made other music that hadn\u2019t been released (although rumours of a Massive Attack collaboration are, sadly, probably untrue). Later, I would also find out the story behind April 5th: it is a song about his wife, named after the date on which she was born \u2013 giving the song\u2019s erotic momentum an extra charge.\nBut then as February to March came again, the days starting to lengthen and warm, I realised it didn\u2019t really matter where Mark Hollis was, or who he was any more. This was a musician who didn\u2019t want us to think about him. This was a musician who wanted to exist absolutely in the moment of music. And so, as the year keeps on brightening, I\u2019ll try to remember the music still continuing, still breathing, after all else has gone. And that voice, soft and sure, sings on: \u201cYouth takes its bow before the summer the seasons bring / Waiting for the colour of spring.\u201d",

At least, that is what the international community hopes as the nuclear-armed neighbours square off once again.\nRationally speaking, neither country\u2019s prime minister can afford another full-scale conflict \u2013 Pakistan\u2019s Imran Khan because he is still getting started after winning power for the first time last July, India\u2019s Narendra Modi because he is seeking a second chance in national polls this spring.\nTwo of the three major India-Pakistan conflicts since partition in 1947 have been waged over Kashmir. They have one factor in common. The war of 1965, the Kargil conflict of 1999, and lesser, recurring clashes have settled nothing. Kashmir remains divided, disputed and prone to violence, the scene of a low-level insurgency and a constant source of friction exploited by extremists on both sides.\nModi clearly felt he had to do something after the Valentine\u2019s Day massacre by Islamist terrorists based in Azad Kashmir that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries. Public opinion, and his political rivals, demanded he act. Tuesday\u2019s \u201csurgical strikes\u201d were the less risky option, compared with a lengthier cross-border ground operation to which Pakistan would perforce have responded militarily.\nOverheated tempers could have had the opposite effect, as in the past, pushing Modi into more drastic action \u2013 and this remains a possibility. Yet what looks, at present, like an Indian decision to limit reprisals was helped by Khan\u2019s calm, non-escalatory handling of the post-attack fallout so far. He maintained this ostensibly reasonable approach on Tuesday, reserving the right to respond \u201cappropriately\u201d in self-defence.\nCould it be Pakistan\u2019s leaders are finally learning their history lessons? Pakistan cannot defeat more powerful, wealthier India. When it tries, it loses. Nuclear is not a sane option. But the country is successfully strengthening its diplomatic and political defences.\nPakistan has a powerful friend and investor in China and plays a key role in Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road project \u2013 which has a growing military dimension. A recent visitor to Islamabad was Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and another wealthy backer.\nThanks, meanwhile, to Donald Trump, Pakistan finds itself increasingly free of Washington\u2019s stifling embrace. Complaining, like India, about Pakistani links to extremist groups, Trump slashed US security aid last year. This and the expected US withdrawal from Afghanistan is welcomed by many Pakistanis as the end of strategic vassalage.\nSo when India vowed to \u201ccompletely isolate\u201d Pakistan diplomatically after the 14 February attack, and threatened international ignominy, it promised more than it could deliver.\nThat could only exacerbate Indian frustrations. And \u201ccool hand\u201d Khan could overplay his cards by appearing to indulge far-right religious groups, as in last year\u2019s election campaign. Promising an inquiry into terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed\u2019s culpability for 14 February, if India first provides evidence, while urging Modi to \u201cgive peace a chance\u201d, is unlikely to be enough.\nAt a weekend election rally in Rajasthan, Modi indicated he would continue to use terrorism as a stick to beat Pakistan. \u201cThere is consensus in the entire world against terrorism ... The scores will be settled this time, settled for good,\u201d he warned. Speaking in Churu after the airstrikes, Modi boasted India was not afraid of escalation.\nOther ministers were more triumphalist still, celebrating an \u201cact of extreme valour\u201d and promising to hit back \u201charder and stronger\u201d if Pakistan retaliated.\nThis sort of jingoism may make electoral sense to Modi\u2019s people. But if they, too, study recent history, they will realise the political route is the only escape from India\u2019s recurring Kashmir nightmare, security specialist Happymon Jacob suggested.\n\u201cAggressive tactics [have] turned south Kashmir\u2019s popular opinion against India,\u201d Jacob wrote in The Hindu. \u201cIndia finds itself in a bind in Kashmir, and it will take a great deal of political sophistication, back-channel reaching out, and comprehensive political vision to get Kashmir back on track.\u201d",

The EU have asked us what we want and we will show them this is what we want.\u201d\nOthers supporting the amendment include Iain Duncan Smith, Dominic Raab, Nigel Evans, Zac Goldsmith, Craig Mackinlay, Anna Soubry and Justine Greening.\nIt calls on May to seek at \u201cthe earliest opportunity a joint UK-EU commitment to adopt part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens\u2019 rights and ensure its implementation prior to the UK\u2019s exiting the European Union, whatever the outcome of negotiations on other aspects of the withdrawal agreement\u201d.\nA spokesman for the EU said the best way to protect citizens\u2019 rights was to agree a withdrawal deal, but that it had been doing much to secure legislation in member states to cover British nationals in the event of no deal.",

        "content": "Volunteer-run arts hub The 343 has swiftly become a vital part of a community confronting the ghosts of its past\nIt all started with a children\u2019s story. Or more specifically, a series of children\u2019s stories, read aloud by drag artists to kids in east Belfast.\nThe event, called Drag Queen Story Time, had been running happily at a local library until former DUP culture, arts and leisure minister Nelson McCausland got wind of it and tried to incite a boycott of the gallery.\n\u201cDirect action was the only possible option,\u201d says Dawn Richardson, who helped organise the event. And so the 343 was born, a feminist-led, LGBTQ+ art space that stands proud as a rejection of Northern Ireland\u2019s more backward political leanings.\nBased on the ground floor of an old Ulster Bank building, halfway up the winding Newtownards Road, the 343 was launched in November and already feels like one of the most vital art spaces in Northern Ireland. It takes its name from Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s landmark 1971 abortion petition, The Manifesto of the 343, and boasts a rolling programme of exhibitions and live performances: it has hosted Queer As Spoke, a night \u201cintended as a safe space for Queers to practise the radical art of existing\u201d, the Gash collective, an Irish collective focused on providing a platform for female identifying and LGBTQ+ DJs and producers, and Scottish dream-pop artist Bell Lungs. Any idea will be considered as long as it\u2019s based in queer or feminist arts and performance.\nAlongside local independent art hubs such as Catalyst, Platform and Golden Thread, the 343 is a fervently inclusive space in a city whose famous mettle has recently been strained by everything from the DUP and flag protests to farcical rows over gay marriage cakes. And situating itself in the east of the city \u2013 an area whose rich cultural history and community spirit is at odds with its deep-seated association with loyalist paramilitaries \u2013 only serves to underscore its forward-moving mentality. \u201cBy being in an area that gets such poor publicity, we really can do important work,\u201d says Richardson. \u201cWe are a country in the throes of PTSD. Growing up in a war zone affects a nation. You can only address these things when you do something about it. It isn\u2019t enough any more to do nothing, and I think the people will succeed where the government has failed us.\u201d\nElectra is a leading Northern Irish drag artist who sits on the board of The 343 and was embroiled in the McCausland saga last July. For her, the importance of the space for creatives and clientele who need it the most can\u2019t be overstated. \u201cThe UK government is happy to cosy up to the DUP, a party that has restricted the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people for years,\u201d she says. \u201cThe need for safe spaces for queer people and women is necessary in an environment that is so hostile towards its most vulnerable, especially when it comes from what\u2019s left of our failed government.\u201d\n\u201cThere are brilliant queer art festivals here such as Outburst, nights like Queertopia and Ponyhawke, and wonderful activist groups such as Alliance for Choice, The Rainbow Project and Belfast Feminist Network,\u201d adds Richardson. \u201cBut there\u2019s nowhere for queer or female-identifying artists to call home, conquer their craft and feel that they really belong. We\u2019re not creating this space to further isolate ourselves. We\u2019re creating it to show people that we\u2019re here, we\u2019re proud and that change will happen.\u201d\nAs Northern Ireland continues to confront spectres of its recent past, the 343 could have a huge impact on the country. \u201cWe must find laughter, make art and stick together through what is a pretty bleak period,\u201d says Electra. \u201cThe liberation movement is growing, the voices are getting louder and there is hope for change again.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at a very interesting time in Northern Ireland,\u201d adds Richardson. \u201cWe have no government to speak of [Northern Ireland has just taken the unenviable world record for the longest time without a sitting government] and we are surrounded by countries who are overtaking us in equality laws and women\u2019s health issues. We have little control over this, but can create a space that is there for people who are truly suffering. We can make that space as joyous and vibrant as possible, and we can empower ourselves and each other. In that, I hope that we can heal.\u201d",

        "content": "Hasty preparations lead to US press having to leave hotel where North Korean leader will stay\nIn one of the more awkward double bookings in diplomatic history, the Hanoi hotel that was supposed to serve as a headquarters for the US press corps had also been reserved by one of the world\u2019s most press-averse and security-fixated dictators, Kim Jong-un.\nSuch cohabitation was never going to work for the North Korean security apparatus, which is not accustomed to dealing with inquisitive journalists. Kim\u2019s bodyguards have been known to accost reporters they suspect of having taken pictures of the leader and demand they hand over their smartphones for scrutiny.\nAfter a brief discussion between the North Korean and Vietnamese officials in Hanoi\u2019s Melia Hotel on Tuesday morning, the US journalists were unceremoniously evicted from the media centre that the White House advance teams had spent days erecting.\nThe fact that the problem was only discovered on Tuesday, the day before Kim is due to meet Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital, said a lot about the haste with which this second summit between the two leaders has been arranged. Hanoi was agreed as a venue two weeks ago, a win for the North Koreans who wanted to combine the trip with a relationship-building session with the Vietnamese leadership. The Trump administration had wanted to meet in the coastal resort of Danang.\nVery few details about the timing and location of the summit have been released so far, other than that Trump and Kim \u2013 who both arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday \u2013 will have a brief one-on-one encounter on Wednesday evening followed by a working dinner with top officials. Their Vietnamese hosts will put on entertainment, possibly in the French colonial-era opera house in central Hanoi.\nA government guesthouse has been made available for working talks on Thursday, the duration and timing of which remain uncertain, but there may also be talks in the Metropole Hotel, where Graham Greene wrote The Quiet American and where Jane Fonda stayed when she made a wartime visit to North Vietnam in 1972.\nGiven the warmth of the relationship Trump claims to have developed with Kim, and the very many unanswered questions about how and whether North Korea will disarm, it is unclear why the two leaders have put off their first meeting until Wednesday evening.\nBy then, Kim will have been in town for more than 24 hours after a 65-hour ride from Pyongyang in his personal armoured train. Like his father, Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader tends to avoid air travel, apparently for security reasons. The Chinese government flew him to the first summit with Trump in Singapore last June, but according to South Korean diplomats Kim has since decided that appearing to depend on China for transport is at odds with the regime\u2019s philosophy of self-reliance. North Korea\u2019s answer to Air Force One, an old Ilyushin, has not been tested over a long distance for some years.\nAfter lumbering across China at a top speed of 38mph, Kim\u2019s green train stopped at the Vietnam border town of Dong Dang on Tuesday morning, where a red carpet had been rolled out and was flanked by Vietnamese soldiers in white ceremonial uniforms. Kim, his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, and their entourage disembarked and the North Korean leader climbed into a stretch Mercedes limousine, which drove off with six bodyguards jogging on either side, the 35-year-old despot waving through a half-opened window.\nThe jogging cordon accompanied the Mercedes out of the centre of Dong Dang, leaving it to drive the rest of the way to Hanoi escorted by Vietnamese motorcycle police. The 100-mile stretch of road was closed to other traffic for most of the day, as was the centre of Hanoi for Kim\u2019s arrival. Spectators clutching Vietnamese, North Korean and US flags crammed the pavements in the old district for the last leg of the journey, where the motorcade was accompanied by an armoured car with a machine gunner perched on the top.\nTrump arrived on Tuesday night on Air Force One after refuelling stops at RAF Mildenhall in the UK and Qatar. Thousands of people, some holding bunches of flowers and Vietnamese flags, turned out to watch his motorcade drive along a dark and closed-off highway into the capital.\nHe is due to meet the Vietnamese president, Nguyen Phu Trong late on Wednesday morning. After lunch with Vietnamese officials there is then another long vacant space in Trump\u2019s diary until his face-to-face with Kim in the evening. No meetings have been scheduled for Thursday, but it is assumed that is when the business of the summit will be done.\nTrump has said he would be happy enough if North Korea sticks to its moratorium on nuclear and missile testing, and his spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, has said the fact that the two leaders are meeting for a second time is a success in itself.\nAny further progress \u2013 perhaps a declaration aimed at formally ending the state of hostilities that is still in force since the 1950-53 Korean war, establishing mutual liaison offices, or more North Korean steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons infrastructure and open up its facilities to international inspection \u2013 would be a further sign that the US and North Korea are stepping away from the nuclear brink.\nHanoi, once bombed daily by the US during the Vietnam war, has eagerly embraced its identity as the \u201cCity for Peace\u201d, proclaimed by hastily printed billboards and banners around the city.\nTruong Thanh Duc, a 56-year-old shopkeeper in Hanoi\u2019s Old Quarter, had printed hundreds of T-shirts of Kim and Trump, with one featuring a stylised likeness of the North Korean leader against a white background, and another showing Trump and Kim\u2019s faces and the words \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cHanoi 2019\u201d.\n\u201cIn my viewpoint, Mr Kim and Mr Trump are two great men,\u201d he said, adding that he thought both men were willing to \u201csacrifice\u201d for their countries in the name of peace.\nAt a salon across town, Le Tuan Duong, a barber, has been offering novelty Kim and Trump haircuts, and has transformed 400 men into lookalikes since last week. Most had been Kims, he said, though there were also a few Hanoians walking around town with a blond Trumpian shock on their crowns.\nBoth men were admirable role models, the hairdresser said. \u201cThese two leaders, they love peace.\u201d",

        "content": "In 1982, when his synth-pop band Talk Talk were making a mark on the charts with the singles Talk Talk and Today, Mark Hollis said: \u201cI want to write stuff that you\u2019ll still be able to listen to in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d Nearly 40 years later, Hollis, who has died aged 64, has left a musical legacy that seems set to last indefinitely.\nAlthough Hollis hated the way Talk Talk were packaged by their label EMI in white suits and black ties and bundled in with New Romantics such as Duran Duran (whom they supported on tour) or Ultravox, even his early songs still stand up to critical scrutiny. Talk Talk, a UK No 23 in 1982, and It\u2019s My Life, which reached 46 on the UK chart in 1984 and 13 when reissued in 1990, are punchy, melodic and tightly focused. Talk Talk\u2019s debut album The Party\u2019s Over climbed to 21 in Britain, but Hollis was dreaming of greater and grander things. The second album, It\u2019s My Life (1984), found the group broadening its musical scope and instrumental palette, and while it reached only 35 in the UK, it cracked the US Top 50 and scored highly on charts across Europe, with European audiences also taking a shine to the single Such a Shame.\nThe group finally cut all ties with the synthesiser era with The Colour of Spring (1986), a powerful and coherent set of songs which delivered the major hit Life\u2019s What You Make It and a slightly lesser hit with Living in Another World. They typified the album\u2019s mix of powerful, spacious rhythms with carefully wrought instrumental colours, topped by Hollis\u2019s pained and yearning vocals. By now Hollis was writing all the material with Tim Friese-Greene, who had been brought aboard for the It\u2019s My Life album as producer and keyboard player. The album was a hit internationally.\nHowever, apart from the compilation Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk (1990), which reached No 3 in the UK and sold a million copies worldwide, this would prove to be the high-water mark of Talk Talk\u2019s chart success. Henceforth Hollis would take the group (comprising its original drummer Lee Harris and bass player Paul Webb, and with Friese-Greene as a regular contributor) into boldly experimental territory, creating music that would prove influential on many other artists, but was anathema to record companies looking for hit singles and platinum discs.\nHollis was born in Tottenham, north London, and attended Tollington grammar school in Muswell Hill (now Fortismere school). Hollis was always cagey about discussing his life and background, but did say he took a course in child psychology at Sussex University which he failed to complete. His move into a musical career was greatly influenced by his older brother Ed, who was writer and producer for the Canvey Island pub rockers Eddie and the Hot Rods. Ed\u2019s own musical tastes were eclectic, and he encouraged Mark to dip a toe into everything from free jazz to prog rock and American garage bands. The punkish spirit of the era could be discerned in Mark\u2019s first band, the Reaction, who released the single I Can\u2019t Resist in 1978.\nEd also influenced the line-up of the fledgling Talk Talk, helping Mark and the keyboard player Simon Brenner to find Webb and Harris, who hailed from the Southend-on-Sea area. Their deal with EMI came about after the A&R man Keith Aspden heard a demo tape they had sent to Island Music, which impressed Aspden so much that he left his previous job to become their manager. EMI put the group together with the producer Colin Thurston, who had worked with David Bowie, the Human League and Duran Duran, and they set to work on Talk Talk\u2019s debut album.\nThe success of The Colour of Spring meant that Talk Talk had a bigger budget to play with on the follow-up, Spirit of Eden (1988), but Hollis\u2019s musical thinking was now geared towards Debussy, Erik Satie and Ornette Coleman rather than other pop or rock acts. Spirit of Eden, with its startling musical textures, sudden changes of pace and interludes of silence, was as much a modern classical album as a pop record. Though many critics hailed it as a masterpiece and it reached the UK Top 20, EMI were frustrated at its lack of commercial selling points. After months of legal wrangling, band and label parted company.\nWith the band now reduced to Hollis and Harris, with Friese-Greene producing and playing keyboards, Talk Talk\u2019s final album Laughing Stock (1991) was released by Polydor\u2019s Verve label, and pushed the musical envelope a little further (it began with 18 seconds of silence). Though sombre and uncompromising, it reached 26 in the UK, a reflection perhaps of the strange, lingering allure of pieces such as Taphead and Ascension Day.\nThe group now disbanded, with Hollis claiming that he wanted to focus on family life with his wife Flick, a teacher, and their two sons. Having been living in rural Suffolk, Hollis moved to Wimbledon, south-west London, in 1998, the same year he released his only solo album, entitled Mark Hollis. If anything even more sparse and haunted than what preceded it, it seemed a fitting coda to Hollis\u2019s career, from which he had now apparently retired. Musicians including Tears for Fears, Radiohead, Elbow\u2019s Guy Garvey and Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree have acknowledged Talk Talk\u2019s influence, while No Doubt\u2019s 2003 version of It\u2019s My Life was a hit in the US and Britain. A tribute album, Spirit of Talk Talk, was released in 2012.\nHollis did break cover fleetingly. As well as making guest appearances on Unkle\u2019s album Psyence Fiction and Phill Brown and Dave Allinson\u2019s AV1 (both 1998), he popped up on Anja Garbarek\u2019s album Smiling & Waving (2001) to play bass guitar and melodica, and in 2004 collected a BMI award as writer of It\u2019s My Life. In 2012 he composed a piece of music for Kelsey Grammer\u2019s TV drama Boss.\nHe is survived by his wife and sons.\n Mark David Hollis, singer, musician and composer, born 4 January 1955; died 25 February 2019\n This article was amended on 11 March 2019.

        "content": "In her resignation letter from the film Luck, the actor questions whether any company should work with disgraced film executive John Lasseter\nWhen the actor Emma Thompson left the forthcoming animated film Luck last month while it was still in production, it was done without public fanfare, and was only confirmed when film-industry publications such as Variety magazine picked up on it. Now Thompson has put herself firmly above the MeToo parapet with the publication publishing her incendiary letter of resignation addressed to the film\u2019s backers, Skydance Media, one of Hollywood\u2019s most prestigious studios.\nIt was known that Thompson was unhappy with the arrival in January of former head of Pixar John Lasseter as the new head of Skydance Animation. But the letter goes into extraordinary detail about her disquiet over the appointment of a studio executive whose downfall had been one of the key landmarks of the Me Too and Times Up campaigns.\nThe move was immediately hailed by activists. Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of the website Women and Hollywood tweeted: \u201cThis is more than an open letter \u2014 Thompson has issued a rallying cry. We hope others with power and privilege will join Thompson in speaking out about abuses of power and those who enable that toxic behavior.\u201d\nLasseter had made his name by directing cutting-edge animated films for Pixar in the 1990s and 2000s, including Toy Story and Toy Story 2, A Bug\u2019s Life and Cars and Cars 2. On the purchase of Pixar by Disney in 2006, Lasseter was appointed chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, after which he supervised such films as Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 3.\nHowever, in the wake of accusations of sexual misconduct that rocked the film industry in 2017, when the New York Times and New Yorker first published its allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Lasseter took a six-month leave of absence after confessing to unspecified \u201cmissteps\u201d. His permanent departure from Disney was announced in June 2018.\nIn her letter, Thompson raises questions about the ethical implications of working with Lasseter. Her implication is that Lasseter\u2019s admitting to \u201cinappropriate hugging\u201d and \u201cother missteps\u201d was insufficient, and that it would be reasonable for women who now work with him to question whether he would act appropriately because he realised the error of his ways or because it was politic to do so.\nThompson concludes by expressing regret about quitting the production, but determining the alternative would be irresponsible for someone in her position.\n\u201cI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\u201d\nWhen Skydance announced it had hired Lasseter there was an immediate backlash against the company, which is owned by David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison and brother of Megan Ellison, who is also a high profile film producer. The Time\u2019s Up campaign said in a statement that the appointment \u201cendorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence\u201d, while the decision was defended by Ellison in a memo, saying: \u201cWe are certain that John has learned valuable lessons and is ready to prove his capabilities as a leader and a colleague.\u201d\nSkydance also took the extraordinary step of organising a \u201ctown hall\u201d in January, where employees were able to question Lasseter over his record. In her letter, Thompson addressed this point, writing: \u201cMuch has been said about giving John Lasseter a \u201csecond chance\u201d. But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?\u201d\nIn the past Thompson has been a vocal supporter of MeToo, telling the Guardian in 2018 that \u201c#MeToo has been a wonderful moment of clarity\u201d. \u201cWhen I was a young woman, older men in the industry would constantly try it on. I was always able to say no, and they took that for an answer. What younger women have to encounter terrifies me.\u201d\nThe Guardian has contacted Skydance, which declined to comment.\nThe full text of Thompson\u2019s letter is below.\nAs you know, I have pulled out of the production of Luck \u2013 to be directed by the very wonderful Alessandro Carloni. It feels very odd to me that you and your company would consider hiring someone with Mr Lasseter\u2019s pattern of misconduct given the present climate in which people with the kind of power that you have can reasonably be expected to step up to the plate.\nI realise that the situation \u2013 involving as it does many human beings \u2013 is complicated. However these are the questions I would like to ask:\n\u2022If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he\u2019s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave \u201cprofessionally\u201d?\n\u2022If a man has made women at his companies feel undervalued and disrespected for decades, why should the women at his new company think that any respect he shows them is anything other than an act that he\u2019s required to perform by his coach, his therapist and his employment agreement? The message seems to be, \u201cI am learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\u2022Much has been said about giving John Lasseter a \u201csecond chance\u201d. But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?\n\u2022If John Lasseter started his own company, then every employee would have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to give him a second chance. But any Skydance employees who don\u2019t want to give him a second chance have to stay and be uncomfortable or lose their jobs. Shouldn\u2019t it be John Lasseter who has to lose HIS job if the employees don\u2019t want to give him a second chance?\n\u2022Skydance has revealed that no women received settlements from Pixar or Disney as a result of being harassed by John Lasseter. But given all the abuse that\u2019s been heaped on women who have come forward to make accusations against powerful men, do we really think that no settlements means that there was no harassment or no hostile work environment? Are we supposed to feel comforted that women who feel that their careers were derailed by working for Lasseter DIDN\u2019T receive money?\nI hope these queries make the level of my discomfort understandable. I regret having to step away because I love Alessandro so much and think he is an incredibly creative director. But I can only do what feels right during these difficult times of transition and collective consciousness raising.\nI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year. But I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\nYours most sincerely,\nEmma Thompson",

        "content": "The Morandi bridge tragedy killed 43 and left 600 homeless \u2013 but also dealt a hammer blow to Italy\u2019s engineering legacy\nOn 14 August last year, the city of Genoa in northwest Italy woke to a strong summer storm. By 11.30am, the rain was so heavy that visibility had fallen dramatically. Videos captured by security cameras show vehicles slowing down as they crossed Morandi Bridge, which grew progressively more enveloped in a grey mist.\nA few minutes later, a 200-metre section of the bridge collapsed, including one of its three supporting towers. The tragedy killed 43 people and left 600 homeless.\nIt also dealt a hammer blow to Italy\u2019s once-proud engineering history \u2013 and the country\u2019s confidence in its mastery of a key construction technology: concrete.\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nA little more than a kilometre long, crossing the Polcevera valley, a river, a railway depot, a densely populated area and several large factories at an average height of 45 metres above the ground, Morandi was one of the longest concrete bridges in the world when it opened in September 1967.\nThe 1960s were Italy\u2019s boom years. For the first time, many Italians could afford a car. But the country\u2019s roads \u2013 many of them narrow, meandering up mountains and twisting through city centres \u2013 needed modernising. Morandi Bridge was the centrepiece of a brand-new network of highways connecting Milan and Turin in the north to the tourist hotspots of the Ligurian Riviera, bypassing a congested Genoa and ultimately completing the coastline highway that runs from southern France to Tuscany.\nNamed after Riccardo Morandi, the engineer who designed it, the new bridge was a multi-span, cable-stayed bridge similar to the Brooklyn Bridge: regular towers, from which a series of exposed steel cables stretched to the bridge\u2019s deck.\nBut, although similar in shape, Morandi Bridge was very different in other ways. The deck was entirely made of reinforced concrete, and it had only four cables per tower, instead of the usual dozens. Crucially, the cables were covered in pre-stressed concrete \u2013 a type of treated concrete invented by the French engineer Eug\u00e8ne Freyssinet. Unlike normal reinforced concrete, which is generally best suited to resisting compression, the new pre-stressed concrete was specifically designed to resist traction.\nAs a result, Morandi Bridge was stronger and lighter, with minimal use of steel, than any other bridge of its era \u2013 and boasted a clean, distinct design that quickly became a symbol of Italian engineering, tangible proof of the country\u2019s technical abilities.\n\u201cThe bridge\u2019s concrete structure won\u2019t need any maintenance,\u201d boasted an article in La Stampa newspaper ahead of the bridge\u2019s opening. \u201cNeither will its stayed cables, which are protected from atmospheric agents by their concrete vest.\u201d\nMorandi himself became one of the most respected engineers in the nation \u2013 going on to use the same technique elsewhere, including at Rome\u2019s airport and a bridge over Libya\u2019s Wadi el Kuf that was the highest single-span bridge in the world \u2013 and helped Italy earn the reputation as the nation that could bend concrete. He died in 1989.\nThe material was perfectly suited to postwar Italy. The country couldn\u2019t afford the amount of steel necessary to build something like the Brooklyn Bridge: steel was in short supply because of international sanctions that had been placed against the fascist government, and Italy lacked the resources to produce steel domestically. It was, however, rich in the clays and river sediments necessary for concrete production. Led by Morandi, the country\u2019s engineers learned how to achieve the same results with concrete that they would with steel.\nThe legacy? Thousands of concrete viaducts, tunnels and bridges that together form a vast engineering triumph.\nToday, the country is still one of the top cement producers and is home to the eighth largest cement company in the world.\n\u201cMorandi, for us engineers, is still a reference and considered to be a precursor,\u201d says Marco di Prisco, a professor of construction science at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and researcher on the life expectancy of concrete buildings.\nBut being an innovator, Di Prisco notes, often comes at a cost.\n\u201cEvery time you create something new, you take some risks.\u201d\nIn the 1960s little was known about the interaction of materials, or the effects of pollution and climate on corrosion. Traffic volumes were very different, and concepts such as the durability or lifespan of a building were not commonly discussed. \u201cBack then, you didn\u2019t really think in terms of durability,\u201d Di Prisco says. \u201cWhereas today we focus much more on how to extend a building\u2019s life. We even come up with a maintenance guide to keep structures in good conditions.\u201d\nWhy exactly the bridge collapsed last August is yet to be understood. A team of experts working with the investigators issued a report this month stating that the bridge samples analysed showed evidence of corrosion and some construction errors, but they steered clear from attributing a cause to the collapse.\n\u201cA bridge is like a car,\u201d says Luigi Gambarotta, professor of structural mechanics at the University of Genoa. \u201cYou can\u2019t overload it, and to keep it working you need to change the broken parts.\u201d\nThat was difficult in the case of Morandi Bridge: the cables were difficult to inspect, and it was unclear how they were coping with increased traffic loads.\n\u201cWhen I visited the bridge in the early 1990s for a documentary on Morandi\u2019s work, I was [surprised] to see fissures and corrosion just 20 years after its completion,\u201d says Giuseppe Imbesi, an architect who worked with Morandi on a bridge proposal for the Strait of Messina.\nMorandi himself was surprised to see the structure age faster than he had anticipated. In 1979 he issued a report detailing a number of interventions to protect the structure against pollution from nearby factories and the salty sea air.\nLittle, however, was done, and by 1992 the trademark concrete cables were heavily corroded. The company that managed the bridge, Autostrade per l\u2019Italia \u2013 then owned by the state \u2013 decided to add extra new cables around the corroded ones, rather than replace them. It also neglected to retrofit the remaining two sets.\n\u201cIt was a criminal, criminal act not to intervene,\u201d says the architect Antonino Saggio, who is leading a campaign to save what remains of the bridge. Despite Saggio\u2019s efforts, the bridge is currently being cut into pieces and torn down. A new bridge designed by Renzo Piano is due to open in 2020.\nDespite Italy\u2019s rather notorious reputation for criminal infiltration into public works, few suspect mafia involvement in the bridge\u2019s collapse. According to the concrete historian Tullia Iori, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Roma Tor Vergata, the concrete industry was largely family-owned at the time and was easier to investigate, and there was a robust tendering system for public works, which were assigned directly by the state and included a high level of technical scrutiny.\nInstead, it was probably simple neglect that felled the bridge. In April 2018, Autostrade \u2013 now a private company \u2013 finally decided there was no more time to waste, and issued a tender offer to retrofit the bridge. The repairs were supposed to start last autumn.\n\u201cThey waited 25 years and then the bridge collapsed. This is how things go in Italy \u2013 you start something and you never finish it,\u201d says Saggio.\nMorandi\u2019s legacy, and with it the Italian national myth of concrete mastery, is now in doubt. \u201cHe was an engineer with an incredible creativity, and was the best Italian bridge designer we ever had,\u201d says Emanuele Codacci-Pisanelli, a bridge engineer who helped restore Morandi\u2019s Wadi el Kuf Bridge.\nBut his structural ideas, despite being sound on paper, were difficult to execute. \u201cImbuing stayed cables in pre-stressed concrete is such a difficult technique. It\u2019s pretty complex,\u201d explains Codacci-Pisanelli.\n\u201cMorandi\u2019s bridge was the most beautiful, the largest and the most audacious bridge we had in Italy,\u201d says Iori.\n\u201cIt was the symbol of the country\u2019s rebirth. We should have preserved it.\u201d\n This article was amended on 27 February 2019 to clarify that the sanctions placed on Italy\u2019s fascist government did not continue after the end of the second world war\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

        "content": "Sources report dissent at shadow cabinet meeting after backing for Brexit amendment\nLabour is braced for a backlash from shadow ministers and backbenchers angry at the party\u2019s plans to support an amendment for a second EU referendum, with several of them warning they would defy the whip in order to sink the plan.\nJeremy Corbyn finally threw his party\u2019s weight behind another vote on Brexit on Monday evening, backing moves for a fresh referendum with remain on the ballot paper if Labour fails to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week.\nLabour sources suggested there was a vocal backlash against the decision at a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, including against the fact it had not been discussed and agreed at a full meeting.\nThe shadow cabinet did not meet last week, and the Brexit move was considered in a series of meetings and conversations among a smaller group of shadow ministers including Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Diane Abbott.\nLabour\u2019s chairman, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, have previously expressed scepticism about supporting a second referendum. \u201cI suspect we\u2019ll see a bit of back-pedalling today,\u201d one Labour MP said.\nThe shadow ministers Tracy Brabin, Melanie Onn, Gloria de Piero, Judith Cummins, Yvonne Fovargue, Mike Kane, Emma Lewell-Buck and Jim McMahon all abstained on Yvette Cooper\u2019s previous attempt to extend article 50.\nThe high-profile backbenchers Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Caroline Flint are among the others who would be highly likely to oppose a second referendum amendment. Powell said she believed at least 25 MPs would vote against any whip to back another referendum.\nThe Labour MP John Mann, a Brexit supporter, criticised the party\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d shift to support a second referendum. \u201cVoters won\u2019t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg. It didn\u2019t end very well for him on tuition fees,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\u201cOur manifesto was unambiguous \u2013 we would accept the result of the referendum. A second referendum doesn\u2019t do that and the voters \u2013 in very, very large numbers \u2013 will not accept that.\u201d\nSpeaking on Today, Starmer said he was \u201cwell aware of different views across my own party\u201d. The shadow Brexit secretary will hold a drop-in session for MPs later on Tuesday, at which a Labour source anticipated anger from shadow frontbenchers.\n\u201cThere are enough Labour MPs who are opposed to this who can kill it off. The chief whip knows that, Keir knows that,\u201d one MP said. \u201cEvery path eventually leads to defeat for a second referendum, more delay and eventually her deal or no deal. What do we do in that scenario? And no one will say.\u201d\nOvernight on Monday, Thornberry and Watson reacted furiously to a Labour source suggesting that the party would not accept a public vote that was between remain and the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cWe would be seeking to prevent such a referendum,\u201d the Labour source said.\nThornberry told broadcasters earlier that those would be terms of a future referendum, and she later stood by her remarks, publicly criticising the Labour briefing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some nonsense that I \u2018misspoke\u2019 earlier on a public vote,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty hard to misspeak identically in 10 interviews, but for clarity: if Theresa May won\u2019t accept our deal, then the public must decide: do we accept whatever deal she gets through, or do we remain? Got it?\u201d\nWatson also criticised the briefing. \u201cWhoever briefed that my colleague \u2018misspoke\u2019 undermines the sovereignty of the current shadow cabinet,\u201d he tweeted.",

        "content": "One of the NFL\u2019s most powerful owners is involved in a sex trafficking investigation. How will the league respond?\nThe NFL has its latest controversy, with the twist being that this time it involves an owner rather than a player. On Friday, news broke that police were charging New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft with soliciting sex at a Florida massage parlor, something authorities uncovered while investigating an alleged sex trafficking ring. On Monday, police issued an arrest warrant for Kraft for two separate misdemeanor charges. This turn of events has created yet another controversy for a league already plagued with them and has provided embattled commissioner Roger Goodell with yet another challenge.\nAccording to police reports, Kraft visited the parlor on two separate occasions, one being the day of the Patriots\u2019 AFC title game last month, and paid for a sexual act. In addition, police claim to have video evidence of one of those encounters. Kraft faces two charges of soliciting prostitution. If he is convicted, he faces up to one year in jail, a $5,000 penalty and 100 hours of education and community service.\nIn response, Kraft\u2019s spokesperson issued the following statement: \u201cWe categorically deny that Mr Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.\u201d\nIt could be quite a big deal. Since Kraft purchased the Patriots in 1994, saving them from a potential relocation, the team has turned into the NFL\u2019s most successful franchise. Under head coach Bill Belichick, who was hired during Kraft\u2019s tenure, the team has won six Super Bowls, including the most recent. Because of this, Kraft has become one of the most high-profile and influential owners in the league. When the NFL ended its lockout in 2011, many within the league recognized Kraft\u2019s efforts during the negotiation process.\nNow, if this were just the matter of a rich man engaging the services of a sex worker, the incident would possibly rank as more embarrassing for the league than anything else. However, officials allege that the Orchids of Asia Day Spa is involved with sex trafficking. If that ends up being the case, and it needs to be emphasized that we currently only have law enforcement\u2019s side of events, it would be the story of one the most powerful people in the NFL being complicit, whether knowingly or not, with what amounts to modern-day slavery. That\u2019s a big deal and the league would have to treat it as one.\nAfter the news broke, the league released a statement simply saying, \u201cThe NFL is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the question going forward. The league has received a huge amount of criticism for its disciplinary policy with, for example, cases of domestic violence being less severely punished than drug offenses. If there\u2019s clear evidence that Kraft is guilty, the NFL will need to punish him or risk opening themselves up to legitimate charges of treating owners more leniently than players. It should also be pointed out that the league can issue punishments even if Kraft is not found guilty in court.\nGoodell himself has said everyone in the NFL needs to be treated the same. When Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was arrested for driving under the influence and possession of a controlled substance in 2014, the NFL gave him a six-game suspension and a $500,000 penalty. When he announced the decision, Goodell said, \u201cI have stated on numerous occasions that owners, management personnel and coaches must be held to a higher standard than players.\u201d\nYes. In 2007, the league fined the team $250,000 and took away their first-round draft pick after an investigation revealed that Belichick illegally taped opponents\u2019 signs. In addition, Belichick was also fined $500,000. In 2015, the team was fined $1m and lost two draft picks, including another first rounder, after quarterback Tom Brady was caught using improperly deflated footballs. Brady was also suspended four games, a punishment he eventually served after a lengthy court battle. Since this latest scandal doesn\u2019t directly involve the team \u2013 the allegations involve Kraft\u2019s private life \u2013 the Patriots are unlikely to be punished. the most likely punishment for Kraft would be a suspension and a hefty fine, although that won\u2019t hurt a man worth billions too much. Although, again, attempting to predict what Goodell and company will do when it comes to issuing punishments is extremely tricky.\nIn an article for the New York Daily News, Jane McManus makes a convincing argument that, should Kraft be found guilty, he should be banned from the league. McManus points out that Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson was essentially forced out of the league after sexual harassment allegations and she argues that this case would justify a similar result. \u201cGoodell and any owners who don\u2019t want to be tainted by these alleged actions need to investigate and send a message,\u201d she writes, \u201cyou can\u2019t appeal to women if owners exploit them without consequences, whether that is on the field, as employees or even in their private lives.\u201d\nAccording to Sports Illustrated\u2019s legal expert Michael McCann, that is highly unlikely, as it would require the votes of 23 of 31 eligible owners. McCann does allow for the possibility that the Kraft could be persuaded to hand over control of his team in order to save face. Kraft\u2019s son Jonathan, who already plays a large role in the organization, would be the obvious successor.\nThe case, it needs to be emphasized, is far bigger than football. Kraft is just one of hundreds who have been charged with soliciting prostitution as part of this investigation. There is a legitimate sports story here involving how the NFL will treat the matter, especially considering past failures when it comes to employees mistreating women. It should not, however, overshadow the fact that the larger story appears to involve women who have been exploited and forced to work under terrible conditions. They are the real victims here, and, in comparison, the trials and tribulations of an NFL team are inconsequential.",

Sometimes even over 65.\nWait, is this not a toddlers\u2019 dance club? No. It\u2019s a sexual health campaign.\nSheesh. All right, different vibe. Why is it called Jiggle, Wiggle then? Don\u2019t ask.\nWhy not? Because I don\u2019t know the answer. All I know is that Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS foundation trust is having a three-month push to persuade older people to use condoms and get tested after they have casual sex.\nI see why they needed a catchier name. So, you mean to tell me that people older than 35 still have sex? Apparently, they do in Derbyshire.\nCrikey. With each other? With anyone they can get, I expect. Jiggle, Wiggle is also targeting those in their 40s, 50s and 60s, who now find casual sex much easier to come by, thanks to dating apps such as Tinder.\nI thought those apps were meant to help you find someone special so you could make a life together? I guess that could also happen. \u201cAlthough most sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are diagnosed in people aged 15 to 24, STIs are not just prevalent in young people,\u201d says Rebecca Spencer, the project\u2019s general manager. \u201cWe want to try and reduce the number of infections across all age groups.\u201d\nThat sounds like a good thing. Is this a big problem then? Well, there\u2019s room for improvement. Overall, STI rates in England fell in the three years to 2017, when there was a total of 422,147 new cases. But the rates are steady or even slightly rising among older people, especially the over-45s and over-65s, who might be more tempted to take risks.\nBecause, deep down, they are all still ravers, punks and hippies? That may be a factor. Or they may have stopped taking the risk seriously. Older women can\u2019t get pregnant, and some of the men have had vasectomies, so it\u2019s possible they feel they don\u2019t need to bother with condoms any more.\nDear oh dear. Besides launching a campaign on social media, Derbyshire NHS trust will distribute free condoms in GPs\u2019 surgeries and food banks.\nThey should leave buckets full of them at garden centres. That\u2019s not a bad idea.\nDo say: \u201cMum, Dad, I think you\u2019re at an age now when we ought to talk about sexual health. Here, I\u2019ve got you a leaflet.\u201d\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cMorning, doctor. Well, I was bending over to put a condom on and my back just went.\u201d",

        "content": "Talk Talk began as 80s synth-pop stalwarts, but Hollis developed not only what became known as post-rock, but his own transcendent music\n Alexis Petridis: \u2018The reluctant pop star who redefined rock\u2019\n Jude Rogers: \u2018Mark Hollis the ethereal outsider\u2019\nI had listened to Talk Talk before, I\u2019m sure, but the moment I first truly heard them was in 1989, in a small room in Bristol, when a friend played me Spirit of Eden. It struck me instantly as sacred music. When the singer sang, I immediately knew that it hurt.\nFor all that Talk Talk were a band, with valued members and collaborators, and for all their much-vaunted evolution from glistening synth-poppers to post-rock pioneers, their music contains one clear through line: Mark Hollis\u2019s voice, and what that voice communicated.\nWhether backed by a Yamaha DX7 or a woodwind ensemble, Hollis sang the English gospel. Gloriously non-macho, his voice contained no trace of bombast or affectation. Instead, there is a plainness that is both honest and heartbreaking. It\u2019s a voice you can believe, a voice that catches and breaks when it strives too hard, rising sharply before falling away at the edges of each line. It is a voice that sometimes seems, in a very English way, to surprise itself with the intensity of its passions \u2013 as on Renee, or the surging chorus of Living in Another World. At its lower register \u2013 on Westward Bound, or Chameleon Day \u2013 it is the murmur of a confessional. It\u2019s a voice with an ingrained ache, which speaks of restrained passion and inner struggle, ordinary earthly torment and longed-for transcendence. It carries, always, the promise of compassion.\nHollis\u2019s voice seems to be forever reaching for a place beyond literal meaning. The band\u2019s name, and the title and lyrics of its first hit, were after all a repudiation of the efficacy of language. It might well be Hollis\u2019s great theme. Listen to him burbling at the end of April 5th, happily lost in a wordless reverie. On one of their biggest hits, Living in Another World, \u201cSpeech gets harder / There\u2019s no sense in writing.\u201d \u201cShould have said so much, makes it harder,\u201d he sings on Watershed. Communication as complication and confusion; knowledge as distraction. Back in the mid-80s, there were tales of Hollis taping together the fingers of a keyboard player to force him to play with greater simplicity.\nAlthough he sang his often opaque words with unsettling intensity, definitive interpretation frequently lies just out of reach. There are recurring refrains, often concerning personal and universal transformation. Though Hollis professed that he was not a strong devotee of William Blake, you can hear that visionary mysticism rise up in songs such as New Grass and Inheritance. Nature appears as both balm and tormentor, rainbow and flood. There are intimations of biblical apocalypse, evocations of a prelapsarian Eden, throwbacks to established folk tropes, opiate songs, laments for youth and war. As he progressed, Hollis seemed increasingly to be eyeing up some great prize, heralding the imminent arrival of a new world. \u201cSomeday, Christendom will come,\u201d he sings on New Grass. The final song on his last album is called A New Jerusalem. Perhaps he found it. You hope so.\nOften you intuited these things, rather than decoded them. His voice was a powerful conduit to other realms. The lyrics for the last three Talk Talk albums are written on the inner sleeve, reproduced in a facsimile of Hollis\u2019s own handwriting, but they sit uncomfortably on the page: terse, disjointed thoughts and phrases. It\u2019s awkward poetry. It is not until you hear the way he sings \u201ctake my freedom, for giving me a sacred love\u201d on Wealth \u2013 a devastating slow-dissolve into spiritual surrender \u2013 that the overwhelming catharsis floods through.\nIt made sense that by the time of his final work, his 1998 solo album, Hollis\u2019s voice had become simply one of several acoustic instruments, his singing a quiver in the grain, a tonal blip, a north London blues incantation. The words had become almost wholly subservient to the mood, and often impossible to discern \u2013 which seemed at least half the point. His creative journey involved a gradual sloughing off of established notions of clarity, meaning, sound. His last album has almost nothing to do with any strand of popular music; it seems to exist in its own world.\nWhen I spoke a few years ago to an executive at EMI, a man who worked with Hollis on compiling the 2013 Talk Talk compilation Natural Order, he recalled that Hollis put almost as much thought into the gaps between the tracks as the songs themselves. \u201cFor Mark,\u201d he said, \u201cas much as anything, it was about how it flowed.\u201d You sensed that Hollis had reached a place where the only meaningful statement that remained was stillness. Silence was his final song. For 20 years he sang it beautifully. I\u2019m so sad that it has ended.",

He told reporters: \u201cQuestions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day.\u201d\nAsked what length of extension the government would recommend if her deal failed and MPs rejected no deal, the spokesman pointed to the prime minister\u2019s words, saying it would be \u201cas short as possible\u201d, and declined to say what the government would do if MPs amended the motion to demand a longer period.\nPressed on whether May was willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, he said: \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t give parliament a vote if she wasn\u2019t willing to abide by it.\u201d\nThe concession angered Brexit-minded Conservative MPs from the European Research Group. Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky that if a delay was seen as a way to stop Brexit completely, this \u201cwould be the most grievous error that politicians could commit\u201d.\nTheresa Villers told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that the prime minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on 29 March.\u201d\nMay stressed her own continued aversion to this option, saying the \u201cabsolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March\u201d.\nNonetheless, her concession brought expressions of relief from business groups, with the British Chambers of Commerce calling it \u201ca small step towards the clarity and precision that businesses need to chart their future direction\u201d.\nMay sought to keep Conservative backbenchers on side by saying the UK and EU would devote time to alternative arrangements to avoid the Irish border backstop, a plan devised by several Tory MPs.\nCorbyn said Labour would still back the Cooper amendment, so as to \u201cto rule out that reckless cliff-edge Brexit\u201d.\nHe also talked up a planned Labour amendment seeking the party\u2019s version of Brexit, including membership of a customs union. In a change to policy, on Monday it was announced that if this plan was not adopted, Labour would back a second Brexit referendum.\nMay criticised this move, saying: \u201cAnyone who voted Labour at the last election because they thought he would deliver Brexit will rightly be appalled.\u201d",

Sign up now!\nThe way some folk go on, you\u2019d think managing the Queen\u2019s Celtic was as simple as turning up, clocking in, tootling a verse or two of The Fields of Athenry on a tin whistle, throwing your boots up and lighting a cigar, then waiting for the silverware to answer the call and roll into the trophy room, three at a time. But tell that to John Barnes. Or Tony Mowbray. Or Jo Venglos, Lou Macari or Liam Brady. It\u2019s not quite as easy as Brendan Rodgers has been making it look. He\u2019s won all seven domestic trophies on offer since taking over at Parkhead in 2016, becoming the first man in history to win two consecutive trebles. He\u2019s well on the way to an almost inconceivable third, which makes his decision to immediately naff off back down south the very minute the first Premier League club came calling \u2013 the chair in his office still spinning, sheets of paper gently gliding back down on to the desk \u2013 seem rather surprising. Shocking, even. Oh Brenny! How could you! And you \u201cliving the dream\u201d and all!\nYet maybe there\u2019s method in the apparent madness. The club Rodgers is set to take over, Leicester City, aren\u2019t in the sort of mess new managers usually find upon their arrival. They got shot of the previous bloke simply because nobody much liked him. They\u2019re in no danger of going down, merely underachieving big-time. The team is packed with plenty of young talent, the sort Rodgers likes to work with. They\u2019re capable of big results, having already beaten Manchester City and Chelsea this season. And they won\u2019t be playing in Europe next year, which will come as blessed relief to a man who presided over the biggest continental defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 7-0 shellacking at Barcelona), the biggest continental home defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 5-0 skelping by PSG) and the most preposterous continental defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 1-0 humiliation by the famous Lincoln Red Imps of Winston Churchill Avenue, Gibraltar). Oh Brenny! Probably for the best that you\u2019ll have a bit of time and space to work this side of things out.\nWhere this leaves the Queen\u2019s Celtic is open to interpretation. Former boss Neil Lennon is set to take over until the end of the season, interim bosses being all the rage these days, shades o\u2019Ole. Whether he\u2019ll keep the job afterwards is less clear. Never mind closing out the treble Treble: first let\u2019s see if he can emerge bother-free from this week\u2019s trips to Tynecastle (where, on his last visit, a back-and-forth with the crowd concluded with a coin pinging off the top of his noggin) and Easter Road (the venue he\u2019s just been cashiered from without ceremony). By contrast, Brendan\u2019s first week down south is unlikely to be as combustible \u2026 unless he makes like the last manager Leicester poached from the Old Firm, that is. In 1978, Jock Wallace arrived from Ibrox and set about constructing some large artificial sand dunes, up which he\u2019d send his distressed players at great speed and with great relish. The Fiver would pay real cash money to see Leicester\u2019s current squad react to a fitness regime like that. \u201cCome back Claude,\u201d Harry, Jamie and Wes would cry. \u201cWe hardly knew ye!\u201d\nJoin Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot clockwatch business on all the night\u2019s Premier League, Football League and fitba action.\n\u201cIn our last two away matches, we have now had two perfectly good goals ruled offside which have proven to be the wrong decision.

        "content": "Hauser & Wirth, LondonHer captivating line drawings from the final decade of a 70-year career reveal the late Romanian conceptual artist\u2019s power, playfulness \u2013 and patience\nGeta Bra\u0306tescu sits at her desk clutching a chunky black marker pen in her heavily wrinkled hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d she says, the square nib traversing the paper in one long continuous line, straight and curved. She pauses: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what came out.\u201d A moment passes and she adds two dots \u2013 beady eyes. \u201cThe man and the donkey.\u201d\nThis filmed cameo of the artist at work appears in The Power of the Line, a solo exhibition at Hauser & Wirth in London. Bra\u0306tescu collaborated with the gallery on the exhibition before she died last year, aged 92. The collages and line drawings on show were made during the final decade of her life, when she focused on creating simple geometric forms \u2013 both sharply angular and gently curved \u2013 based on the line.\nBra\u0306tescu was one of the first conceptualist artists in Romania. Her compositions are reminiscent of Calder\u2019s mobiles, Matisse\u2019s cut-outs and even, at times, Picasso\u2019s cubist women. Her studio was sacred \u2013 a safe physical and psychological space in which to experiment and explore ideas that could be sparked by anything, from daily objects to the nubby texture of a piece of paper.\nBra\u0306tescu was born in the city of Ploie\u0219ti and lived in Romania her entire life. Her seven-decade career was set against an unpredictable and often turbulent time, including the second world war and the Soviet occupation from 1944 to 1958. In the late 40s, she studied literature at at the University of Bucharest and art at the Bucharest Academy of Fine Arts (now the National University of Arts Bucharest). She was expelled from the latter \u2013 the Communist party took against her bourgeois upbringing \u2013 but writing and drawing continued to be a common thread in her artistic practice.\nIn Hauser & Wirth\u2019s gallery on Savile Row, Bra\u0306tescu\u2019s compositions are curated both chronologically and according to colour. The arrangement brings to mind the spring/summer collections on display at nearby clothes shops, but Bra\u0306tescu\u2019s fluid works are far from seasonal.\nThe eyes flit from one cluster of drawings to the next, the works displayed in horizontal, vertical and stepped configurations. Lines, shapes and silhouettes may be contained within framed sheets of paper but they seem to leap and swirl in the blank space between. No labels identify the works, so you can make of each composition what you will, and each swings between the figurative and the abstract. Patches of pink resemble licking flames while script-like lines entreat you to step closer in an effort to decipher them. Could those acute-angled pink triangles be stiff flags on a still day, origami paper planes, or watermelon, thinly sliced? Two black stripes recall chopsticks, while a curvy stroke and two pink spots hint at the female form. Fluorescent shades nod to Post-it notes \u2013 which appear across the room. Bra\u0306tescu incorporated everyday materials from cardboard coffee stirrers to matchboxes into her work.\nHer pieces are imbued with both purpose and play. A single streak carries a certain weight and yet, as with the man and the donkey, adding two dots can transform a severe line into a smile. Two films in the centre of the gallery \u2013 Linia (The Line) (2014) and The Gesture, The Drawing (2018), made with the Romanian artist \u015etefan Sava \u2013 reveal her confidence in her creative process. Just as Bra\u0306tescu knows when something is working \u2013 holding her hands in the air and proudly pronouncing it \u201cdone\u201d \u2013 she knows when to cut and run: \u201cI must tear it apart, I don\u2019t like this one.\u201d (Just in case she were to change her mind, she rips the sheet from her sketchbook, folds it in half and tears it, once then twice.)\nFor Bra\u0306tescu, the line must have freedom of movement. \u201cForms are created by dancing with each other,\u201d she says. \u201cThey dance \u2013 if they do not dance, they grow bored, they die; the dead form is thrown away.\u201d She drags a pen across the page in one continuous gesture, letting the nib slip and slide, leaving a trail that is thick and thin. It is captivating, working out, alongside her, what\u2019s next. It\u2019s as if she herself isn\u2019t always privy to that information: \u201cLet\u2019s see what comes to my mind.\u201d\nIt is hard to tear yourself away from this small though lively exhibition, and particularly the second of the two films. Perfectionists might find it hard to watch \u2013 will she stick within the lines; has she seen that gap? Her studio may have been sacrosanct but, as we can see, her worktop was scattered with pens, rulers, scissors and open-topped sticks of glue. \u201cDo you have the patience?\u201d a bespectacled Bra\u0306tescu asks, as she colours green a triangular section outlined on white paper. You will do. And when you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll want to walk round the exhibition again until you, too, become part of the continuous performance.\nGeta Bra\u0306tescu. The Power of the Line is at Hauser & Wirth, London, until 27 April.",

        "content": "Global Radio changes likely to result in job losses as local breakfast shows are axed\nDozens of radio stations across the UK are to lose almost all of their local programming in a move likely to result in hundreds of job losses, the closure of dedicated radio studios and regional voices being replaced by programmes hosted from London.\nGlobal Radio has announced that it will replace the 40-plus local breakfast shows across its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three nationwide programmes.\nThe changes, which will be brought in during the course of this year, are likely to result in presenters and producers across the country finding they are being replaced by big names based far away from the communities they serve.\nThe number of regional drivetime shows on Capital, Smooth and Heart will also be substantially reduced and all locally produced evening and weekend programmes will be axed. Local journalists, engineers and marketing staff are expected to be affected by job cuts.\nGlobal will close 10 of its 24 dedicated radio studios \u2013 in Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon \u2013 in a blow to the media industry outside the capital.\nThe shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said the job losses were a \u201ctravesty\u201d and \u201cparticularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure\u201d.\n\u201cReplacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country. Radio has unique reach, providing listeners with national and a local news and friendly company. This announcement is a terrible blow,\u201d he said.\nThe move will effectively create three new national radio stations, albeit ones that have to opt-out to regional presenters for three hours a day in order to meet the conditions of their local broadcasting licences.\nEven those presenters who remain to provide the token regional drivetime programmes on Capital, Smooth, and Heart will serve larger geographical regions than before, covering large swaths of the UK with a single programme.\nThe move is the culmination of a decade-long project by Global Radio, which has bought up local radio stations across the UK and slowly combined them under a handful of national brands, increasingly sharing programmes across all stations.\nFor instance, the likes of Manchester\u2019s Galaxy, Cardiff\u2019s Red Dragon and Nottingham\u2019s Trent FM have been combined under the Capital brand, losing much of their regionally produced programming in the process. The change is even starker at the Heart network, which was created in 2008 by rebranding more than 30 distinct local radio stations, all of which will now have the same centrally produced morning programme.\nA spokesperson for Global would not confirm the total number of job losses as a result of the announcement, which was first reported by RadioToday, as it said it was consulting with staff. However, the decision to axe about 60 regional breakfast and drivetime shows is likely to leave a substantial number of presenters and broadcasters out of work and reduce the opportunities for new talent to break into the sector.\nThe Global chief executive and founder, Ashley Tabor, said the decision would result in \u201csignificant changes at an operational level\u201d and would allow his stations to compete more effectively with the BBC.\nThe changes are possible because of new regulations issued last year by Ofcom allowing station owners to reduce the minimum amount of local programming on local radio stations during daytime hours from seven hours a day to just three.\nOfcom also removed a requirement on local stations to produce their own breakfast show, the most important programme on any station\u2019s lineup and one that shapes its identity.\nIn return, stations have to produce an \u201cenhanced local news service\u201d, which Ofcom defines as meaning the inclusion of hourly news bulletins throughout the day featuring at least one \u201cfully formed local news story\u201d relevant to local listeners.\nHowever, this news output may be produced by journalists based hundreds of miles from listeners. Global\u2019s changes mean one team of news staff will be covering an area stretching from Cornwall to Gloucester.\nGlobal argues that the old system of local radio regulation was designed in a pre-internet era and is no longer appropriate when it is competing with other services for attention.\nCommercial radio in the UK is booming, with investment flooding into the sector as the public switch to digital radio and to devices such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, prompting them to try new stations. However, the focus has been on national rather than local stations.",

The longer option, until the end of 2020, is seen by some senior EU insiders as a political tactic designed by the European commission to scare Conservative Eurosceptics into voting for the withdrawal agreement.\nIf the UK won an extension exceeding three months, it would have to be represented in the European parliament.\nEU sources stress the EU has no fixed position on how long the Brexit extension should last. \u201cWe would pay a lot of attention to the business continuity argument,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cWe have a number of important decisions this year and we cannot allow the mess of Brexit to pollute the decisions of the union.\u201d\nBrussels is sceptical that a divided Commons would find in three months the consensus that has eluded MPs for more than two and half years. \u201cIf people cannot agree now, why would it be possible in three months?\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cThat being said, I don\u2019t see that [EU27] heads of state and government would say no [to a three-month extension]. Probably they will say \u2018let\u2019s do that, let\u2019s give them a last chance.\u2019\u201d\nDuring a three-month extension period the EU would accelerate the no-deal planning, the source added.\nEuropean sources believe the last possible moment to clinch a Brexit deal, or an extension, will fall on 21/22 March, when EU leaders, including the prime minister, gather for a scheduled spring summit.\n\u201cThe absolute deadline is the European council,\u201d said another senior EU source, casting doubt on an 11th-hour agreement in the immediate days before 29 March, when the UK leaves the EU, with or without a deal.\nIntense discussion on delaying Brexit came as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, arrived in Brussels on Tuesday for talks with the team of the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.\n\u201cThey held detailed technical discussions as part of the process ... to agree a deal that would have the support of the UK parliament and the EU,\u201d a UK spokesperson said.\nCox was meeting EU officials in an attempt to pin down further assurances that would persuade MPs to back the Brexit deal they rejected by a historic majority last month.\nWork is being pursued in three areas. First, the two sides are exploring changes to the non-binding political declaration that maps out the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The new version is expected to feature more details on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection, as May attempts to win over Labour MPs. But the government continues to rule out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan of a full customs union with the EU.\nThe second strand of work is focused on agreeing a process to agree \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that could replace the contested Irish backstop. The backstop, a fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is part of the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which the EU has said is not open for renegotiation.\nThe EU has, however, promised to explore with the UK \u201calternative arrangements\u201d such as technology and efficient customs procedures that could render the backstop unnecessary.\nTory Eurosceptic backbenchers hoping for a speedy agreement on those alternative arrangements are likely to be disappointed. Instead, negotiators hope to agree on a detailed timetable on the process for finding those alternative arrangements for the next 21 months.\nThe third area of work also seeks to quell MPs\u2019 fears about the UK being \u201ctrapped\u201d in the backstop. The EU is ready to add more legal weight to previous guarantees that the backstop is a last-resort option. A letter from EU leaders, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, released in January, could be turned into \u201ca joint interpretative statement\u201d \u2013 a document with greater legal heft that would be published in the EU rulebook, the Official Journal.",

        "content": "Greater Manchester mayor says this part of levy would disproportionately affect poor\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester has been accused of a \u201ccop-out\u201d after a decision to exempt private cars from a daily charge under which polluting vehicles will pay up to \u00a3100 a day to use roads in the region.\nAndy Burnham asked the government for \u00a3116m to implement Greater Manchester\u2019s plan, which includes a clean air zone designed to drastically reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide by 2024.\nPoor air quality contributes to the equivalent of 1,200 deaths a year in Greater Manchester, where 152 stretches of road will soon breach legal limits for concentrations of NO2 unless action is taken.\nAbout 285,000 private cars licensed in Greater Manchester already breach air pollution limits, as do 2,000 buses, 9,000 minicabs, 2,000 taxis and 11,000 HGVs, according to research from the Greater Manchester combined authority.\nFrom 2021, buses and HGVs made before 2013 will have to pay \u00a3100 a day to drive on any road in Greater Manchester apart from motorways. Older taxis and private hire vehicles will pay \u00a37.50 each, and from 2023, vans and minibuses will also be charged \u00a37.50.\nBut cars will be exempt after the GMCA decided levying a charge against private drivers would disproportionately affect poorer people who could not afford to upgrade their vehicles.\nAlex Ganotis, the leader of Stockport council and lead for clean air, said: \u201cIncluding private vehicles would have hit, disproportionately, our poorer communities.\u201d\nHe added that private vehicles are idle for \u201cmore than 90% of the time, so we are also looking at intensity of use, not just volumes of vehicles\u201d.\nGanotis said including private hire vehicles would necessitate a national scrappage scheme to help people trade in their old vehicles \u2013 something the government has ruled out.\nPete Abel from Manchester Friends of the Earth said: \u201cNot including private vehicles in the clean air zone is a cop-out. Our children need us to take urgent action now \u2013 2024 is too late.\u201d\nBurnham insisted the decision was not a political calculation designed to save him 285,000 votes. \u201cIn our judgment, it would have been disproportionate to hit people with often the least ability to change their car, when we know that these proposals can achieve compliance by 2024,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are obliged to consider the socioeconomic impact of our proposals and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s important to stress that 80% of cars will be compliant by 2021, and that figure rises all of the time.\u201d\nAt a press conference in Manchester on Tuesday, Burnham played a video filmed at St Ambrose primary school on Princess Parkway, one of the busiest and most polluted streets in Greater Manchester.\nIn it, the headteacher talked about being able to taste the pollution and lamented that she always had to keep the front-facing windows shut because the air was so dirty.\nBurnham said he had never forgotten visiting the school. \u201cA young lad with asthma told me that often he couldn\u2019t play football outside with his mates because of the air pollution,\u201d he said.\nYet most of the traffic passing by the school is made up of private cars, Abel said. \u201cIf you look at the Department for Transport\u2019s own traffic counts, you will see that 90% of the vehicles passing that school are private cars/taxis, and Andy Burnham\u2019s plan will do little to reduce the pollution outside that school, and it will still have to keep its windows shut,\u201d he added.\nA local group in Levenshulme, one of the most polluted suburbs in south Manchester, said it was also disappointed by the exemption of private cars.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to finally see proposals to address our air pollution crisis in Greater Manchester, but it\u2019s disappointing that charging on the most polluting cars has been ruled out,\u201d said Jen O\u2019Brien from Clean Air Levenshulme.\n\u201cDirty air disproportionately impacts the health of the poorest communities, children and the elderly \u2013 urgent action is needed to limit the dirtiest vehicles travelling in and to the city centre, and that should include cars, ensuring healthier air for everyone sooner.\u201d\nOther cities introducing clean air zones are not exempting private drivers. Birmingham will charge \u00a38 a day for cars and \u00a350 for buses, HGVs and coaches.\nClean air zones are being introduced by cities across the UK after the government ordered more than 60 local authorities to produce and implement plans to bring NO2 limits within legal limits \u201cin the shortest possible time\u201d.\n This article was amended on 27 February 2019. An earlier version, referring to vehicles which breach air pollution limit, gave a figure of 77 HGVs. The correct figure is 11,000.",

        "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s the sunshine,\u201d Paul Nicholls said several times on Tuesday as a dozen gleaming Cheltenham contenders paraded in 16C but there was more to his upbeat mood than the weather. The 10-times champion National Hunt trainer has not won a Grade One race at the Festival since the second day in 2015. This time, however, hope has been replaced by expectation once more.\nFor the first time since the days of Kauto Star and Denman, there is a serious Gold Cup contender in the \u201cmillionaires row\u201d of boxes in Nicholls\u2019s top stable, as Clan Des Obeaux, the King George winner, heads towards the meeting\u2019s showpiece event. That, in turn, gives Nicholls options, and the admirable Frodon now seems as likely to run in the Ryanair Chase as he is to line up alongside his stable companion the following day.\nWith Quel Destin, the second-favourite for the Triumph Hurdle, and Topofthegame, a 6-1 chance for the RSA Chase, also in the mix, it is no surprise Nicholls sees this as his strongest Festival team for several seasons.\n\u201cFitness-wise, they look fantastic,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cA horse like Quel Destin has had six runs and he looks like he hasn\u2019t had any runs. They look big and strong and well, so we\u2019re going into it with some good chances.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t held back on them or trained them just for Cheltenham, they\u2019ve won races along the way. But everything has gone so well this season. Last year we had 124 winners and about two-and-a-half million in prize money but I never thought the horses were really right. For whatever reason, I just didn\u2019t think that they performed to their best.\u201d\nClan Des Obeaux is closing in on Presenting Percy, last year\u2019s RSA Chase winner, at the top of the Gold Cup betting and could easily start as the favourite to give Nicholls his fifth win in the race.\n\u201cEverything has gone to plan with him, he looks great and he\u2019s come out of his last race [at Ascot] very well,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just progressive. People keep thinking it was a soft race the other day but he beat a dual Grade One winner in Terrefort and absolutely murdered him. It was good to see him travel so well the other day, jump and then wing the last and quicken all the way to the line, because he had basically been a bit babyish.\n\u201cLast year we couldn\u2019t really train him how we wanted. He had a splint, which held us up all the time, but from the day he won his first three-year-old, we always thought this was going to be a proper chaser.\u201d\nClan Des Obeaux\u2019s record at Cheltenham shows no wins from four attempts but his trainer sees no reason to question his ability to act on the track.\n\u201cThe first time he was only just beaten in a Listed juvenile hurdle,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cHe should never have run in the Triumph Hurdle, he\u2019s not a Triumph horse. Then he was second in the Dipper Novice Chase just after turning five, and after that he carried 11st 12lb in the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup and finished second to a horse carrying 10st 2lb.\n\u201cHarry [Cobden] got off him that day and said he was still learning. Now he\u2019s mature and he\u2019s done his own talking on his last two runs and we\u2019re really excited about running him in the Gold Cup.\u201d\nFrodon has an outstanding record at Cheltenham, including wins in the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup and the Cotswold Chase this season, but having apparently been seen as a likely runner in the Gold Cup after the latter success, he could yet be diverted to the Ryanair Chase.\n\u201cFrodon has had a wonderful season, he\u2019s improved and improved and there\u2019s been a lot of debate about where he\u2019s going to run,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI\u2019ll confirm for both and then make a plan and run where we think we\u2019ve got our best chance. I\u2019m not worried about the trip in the Gold Cup but it will probably be a tougher race than the Ryanair and Paul [Vogt, Frodon\u2019s owner] has said he\u2019ll leave it up to me.\u201d\nWincanton \n\n1.20 Champagne Mystery \n1.50 Ostuni \n2.20 Statistical \n2.50 Chef D'Equipe \n3.25 Collooney \n3.55 Ted Bach \n4.30 Tikkapick \n5.00 Risk A Fine \nMusselburgh \n\n2.10 John Williams \n2.40 Landsman \n3.15 Call The Cops \n3.45 Henry's Joy \n4.20 Wot A Shot \n4.50 Tokaramore \n5.20 Gran Paradiso \n\nSouthwell \n  \n2.30 Gorgeous General \n3.05 Harbour Quay (nb) \n3.35 National Glory \n4.10 Weld Al Emarat (nap) \n4.40 Stay Forever \n5.10 Lexikon \nKempton Park \n  \n4.55 Joey Boy \n5.30 Magicinthemaking \n6.00 Daring Guest \n6.30 Verdana Blue \n7.00 Intrepidly \n7.30 Cold Harbour \n8.00 Reignite \n8.30 Rivas Rob Roy",

        "content": "Woman says Israeli-Australian former teacher abused her as a child \nNew allegations of sexual misconduct have been made in Israel against Malka Leifer, a former headteacher wanted on dozens of charges of child sexual abuse in Australia.\nLeifer left Israel in 2000 to run an ultra-Orthodox Jewish girls\u2019 school in Melbourne but returned in 2008 after students raised allegations. The Israeli-Australian citizen is in jail awaiting the outcome of an extradition trial, and denies the allegations.\nOn Tuesday, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, Kan, said it had spoken to a woman who claimed she was abused as a child by Leifer before the teacher moved to Australia.\n\u201cShe would kind of cling to me,\u201d the unidentified woman said in an audio recording. \u201cOne day she invited me to her house, but I have a blackout. I remember that I escaped to my house. I do not remember what happened, I\u2019ve been trying to forget those years.\n\u201cShe was crazy about me; all the time she stroked me. She used to sit with me for private conversations, all the time stroking my leg, up and down on my skirt.\u201d\nKan said there were other similar testimonies from Leifer\u2019s time in Israel. Jewish Community Watch, an advocacy group to combat child sexual abuse, said in an email that it was aware of \u201cother alleged Israeli victims\u201d but could not provide more details.\nThe Guardian has not been able to independently verify the testimony. The alleged abuse took place while Leifer was working at a seminary on the outskirts of Tel Aviv almost two decades ago, meaning the statute of limitations to prosecute her has expired.\nYehuda Fried, who represents Leifer, said the court is solely focused on the question of extradition and not other allegations. \u201cWe reject all attempts from interested parties to influence the court with erroneous publications,\u201d he said in a statement. He refused to comment on the substance of the latest allegation.\nDassi Erlich, who has accused Leifer of abusing her in Melbourne and has campaigned for her extradition, said she was \u201cencouraged and heartened by the bravery\u201d of the new accusers.\n\u201cEach new voice that rises above the fear of remaining silent is so valuable and important in helping to change the world into a better place,\u201d she said.\nThe Israeli case has been beset by delays and suggestions of foul play. Last year, the state prosecution said Leifer had faked mental illness to avoid house arrest. She was subsequently re-arrested.\nIsrael\u2019s deputy health minister, Ya\u2019acov Litzman, who leads an ultra-Orthodox party, was accused this month of obstructing the extradition case. Israeli media have since reported he allegedly pressured doctors to falsify psychiatric evaluations that would deem Leifer unfit to face trial.\nLitzman\u2019s office has denied any wrongdoing.",

        "content": "James Baldwin\u2019s story of David\u2019s careless affair depends on discrimination just as much as the \u2018negro problem\u2019 novel his publisher wanted\nWhen Knopf rejected Giovanni\u2019s Room in 1956, the publisher told James Baldwin it was because he wasn\u2019t \u201cwriting about the same things and in the same manner as you were before\u201d. While posterity has shown just how wrong they were to try to restrict Baldwin\u2019s vision, they were also mistaken \u2013 for Baldwin was, in fact, writing about the same things.\nGiovanni\u2019s Room documents the experience of people who have faced prejudice, lived with the shame of being cast out of society, and whose very nature has put them in danger. You don\u2019t need to know much about Baldwin to see how this book wasn\u2019t a great departure. In the eyes of Knopf, his previous book, Go Tell It on the Mountain had focused on \u201cthe negro problem\u201d; his new novel about white homosexuals, therefore, would ruin his reputation. But how America dealt with racism was connected to how it dealt with sexuality, in Baldwin\u2019s mind: \u201cThe sexual question and the racial question have always been entwined, you know. If Americans can mature on the level of racism, then they have to mature on the level of sexuality.\u201d\nAnd he has plenty to say about race. There may not be \u2013 as Knopf complained \u2013 any black characters, but this enabled Baldwin to say even more about white American culture. The narrator David is labelled as a representative of his culture; introduced throughout as \u201cmonsieur l\u2019americain\u201d, his father tells him he is \u201cas American as pork and beans\u201d and he himself knows he shares a \u201ccommon quality\u201d with all the other Americans in France.\nMeanwhile, his fragile masculinity, his obsession with his schlong (\u201cmy troubling sex\u201d), his habit of saying terrible things about camp men (\u201cfairies\u201d, as he calls them) could almost make him that paragon of white masculinity, the hero of a Hemingway novel. In some ways, Giovanni\u2019s Room often feels like a pastiche of Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises: both contain long, bibulous scenes in Paris cafes, references to Spain and a portrayal of Americans who are doing things in France that they would not dare do at home.\nPapa\u2019s version of American manhood was challenging and problematic enough for his own flawed heroes. For Baldwin\u2019s David, it is even more tormenting. Though David has redeeming qualities and Baldwin ensures we sympathise with his joys and agonies, he also behaves despicably \u2013 especially towards Giovanni.\nDavid might love Giovanni, but he also says that Giovanni makes him want to vomit. He treats the poor doomed boy with contempt, in part, from his being a white American and Giovanni being Italian. This isn\u2019t \u2013 pun intended \u2013 a black and white situation. There are plenty of complicated reasons why David feels so easily able to abandon his lover, but race is among them.\nWhen the novel was published in 1956, there were still a few people alive who had been around when Italian Americans had faced lynchings. There were many who would have seen \u201cNo Guineas\u201d signs alongside \u201cNo Negroes\u201d at places of work, and would have remembered the 1920s quota acts that limited Italian immigration. All made Italians seem lesser, undesirable citizens. Around a decade before Baldwin\u2019s novel, thousands of Italians had been arrested as the US entered the second world war. Hundreds of thousands had been made to carry ID cards, accept travel restrictions and seizures of personal property. Only six years before the book was published, the first Italian was elected to the US Senate. It would be another four years before there was a Catholic US president. And so it goes on.\nAs a New York native, Baldwin must have seen the contempt with which Wasps could treat Italians; his choice of Giovanni for David\u2019s lover was no coincidence. Giovanni himself frequently accuses David of treating him as subhuman, at one point complaining that if David were to encounter him in Italy, he would just see him and his family as part of the scenery. David would pass through, \u201cshitting on us with those empty smiles Americans wear everywhere\u201d. And, he adds, \u201cyou will have no idea of the life there, dripping and bursting and beautiful and terrible, just as you have no idea of my life now.\u201d\nDavid is a romantic tourist, cruising through other lives, casually leaving a trail of destruction. He is able to act like that because he is a white American, with all the privilege and historic injustice that entails. \u201cI do not understand Americans at all,\u201d says Giovanni, early on, when he is getting to know David. By the end, he understands them only too well \u2013 and he pays for that knowledge with his life. And that\u2019s classic Baldwin.",

Later in the footage, workers appear to drag young calves across the floor, and at one point appear to be force-feeding a young calf, as well as beating it. At one point a cow appears to be attempting to tend to a still-born calf.\nThe footage was obtained over July and August of last year by Animal Rights group Surge. It has been released on their website.\nThe farm in question has been named by the activist group as C J and G R Carnell dairy farm. The Guardian spoke to the farm, but they said they would not be able to comment as they had not at that time seen the footage. Subsequent attempts to contact them have not been successful.\nEd Winters, co-director of Surge, said: \u201cThe footage seen here shows not only a flagrant violation of the safety of these animals, but points to the wider systemic issues found throughout the whole dairy industry.\u201d\n He goes on to say that the footage also shows the reality of \u201cthe separation of new-born calves from their mothers.\u201d\nThe investigation follows a number of stories in the last year about cruelty on farms. In November 2018 two men pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty on a farm in Lincolnshire.\nThe footage has been passed to the RSPCA so that it can consider prosecuting those involved. \n Sara Howlett, the RSPCA national media manager said: \u201cThis footage is distressing and we are looking in to it. We urge anyone with concerns about animal welfare to contact us on 0300 1234 999 as soon as possible so we or the relevant authority can act on the information and alleviate any potential suffering.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s Health and Safety Executive guidelines (HSE) state that when it comes to handling livestock, workers should \u201cnever use sticks and prods to strike an animal,\u201d adding that \u201cthis may breach welfare legislation as well as agitating the animal\u201d.\n\u201cThe language and the body language of these workers with the animals is really not what you want to see,\u201d said vet Paul Roger, chair of the UK-based Animal Welfare Science, Ethics and Law Veterinary Association. \u201cThat level of force is not acceptable. These are not the sort of standards you usually encounter in the dairy industry.\u201d",

        "content": "Families hear first day of evidence into 1974 atrocity in which 21 people died\nFamilies have paid tribute to victims of the 1974 IRA Birmingham pub bombings, in the first day of evidence at the inquest into the atrocity.\nTwenty-one people were killed and more than 200 injured when bombs were detonated in two Birmingham city centre pubs \u2013 the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town \u2013 on the evening of Thursday 21 November nearly 45 years ago.\nThe inquest into the deaths was initially opened in November 1974, but was adjourned to allow for a criminal investigation. In 1975, six men \u2013 who became known as the Birmingham Six \u2013 were convicted for the bombings, but were acquitted 16 years later, in 1991.\nPaul Rowlands, the son of John Rowlands, 46 \u2013 who was one of a group of six friends who died together \u2013 told the inquest the Mulberry Bush had been his dad\u2019s favourite pub. \u201cMy only consolation is that on the night of his death he died with his friends, as they stood around the bar,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI know that he loved me and that he was always there to protect me,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do miss him and wish only that he had lived long enough to have seen his grandchildren and his great grandchildren grow up.\u201d\nFresh inquests into the deaths were ordered in 2016 but were delayed by disputes over whether the hearings should examine who might be responsible for the bombings.\nIn January 2018, the high court overturned a ruling by the coroner Sir Peter Thornton that alleged perpetrators would not fall within the framework of the inquest. Thornton appealed against that decision the following July and the court of appeal ruled in his favour in September.\nThe inquest, at the Birmingham civil justice centre, is expected to last up to six weeks. The jury will hear \u201cpen portraits\u201d about the victims, read by their family, friends and lawyers, on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, jurors will be taken to view the sites where the targeted pubs used to be.\nSpeaking on Monday, Thornton said that as well as establishing how each of the victims died, the inquest would also hear evidence about IRA warnings before the bombings and the response of the emergency services on the night.\n\u201cIn addition to the telephone warning which was made to the local paper, you will hear evidence about other possible forewarnings,\u201d said Thornton. \u201cBy forewarning, I mean some evidence in advance of the bombings that something bad was going to happen in Birmingham which may have been notified to the police.\u201d\nHe said that attributing blame for perpetrating the bombings was a job for \u201cthe police and prosecution through the criminal courts\u201d.\nOn Tuesday, the jury heard tributes to 15 of the victims. Danielle Fairweather-Tipping, the cousin of Neil \u201cTommy\u201d Marsh, at 16 the youngest of the victims, told the inquest he would have been 62 this November.\n\u201cHe would have most likely lived a life close to his family and he probably would have got married and had children,\u201d she said. \u201cHis mother would have had the joy of being part of his life, the joy of caring for grandchildren she never had.\u201d\nPaul Thrupp, son of Trevor Thrupp, 33, said that after his father\u2019s death his sister thought she saw him wherever she went, hoping that perhaps he had not died and had just forgotten where he lived. \u201cI gave my sisters away for their wedding, which was a privilege my dad should have enjoyed,\u201d said Thrupp.\nMichelle Sealey and Paul Bridgewater, the daughter and son of Paul Davies \u2013 who died aged 17 \u2013 told the inquest their father had been known for being handsome and charming. Bridgewater, who was not yet born when his father died, said: \u201cI sometimes wonder what it would have been like to know him. Perhaps we would have gone to [Aston] Villa matches together as father and son.\u201d\nLynn Bennett, 18, and Stephen Whalley, 21, both died at the Tavern in the Town while on a blind date, after meeting through a lonely hearts column in NME magazine.\nBennett\u2019s sister Claire Luckman told the inquest her sister and father had been season ticket holders at Birmingham City football club and had always attended matches together. Her father never stepped foot inside the club\u2019s stadium again after his daughter\u2019s death.\nIn a statement from Whalley\u2019s mother, who was too elderly and frail to attend the inquest, she said she and her husband had been overjoyed when Stephen was born because she had previously lost two children at birth.\n\u201cWhilst I would love the world to know about my son Steven and the lovely man he was, it is just too difficult and painful for me to recall any memories I have,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is too traumatic to remember.\u201d",

        "content": "Australia\u2019s love affair with suppression orders amounts to one law for big publishers and no law for everyone else\nAustralians with a modicum of curiosity might well ask what\u2019s been going on.\nCardinal George Pell, an Australian who is one of the most senior people in the hierarchy of the Catholic church, was found guilty in December and no one till now has been allowed to know the details of the charges against him, the trial proceedings, the identity of the complainants, or his conviction.\nIt left a pretty big gap in the community\u2019s knowledge of a serious event in the affairs of the nation.\nThe county court in Melbourne ordered that any Pell-related criminal information be kept under wraps pending the outcome of a planned second trial on a number of separate charges. The notion was to protect prospective jurors at a second trial from having their thoughts contaminated and their views prejudiced by what happened at the first.\nNow that we know there will be no second trial, the suppression order remaining in place against reporting the verdict on the first trial looks, to my mind and in this age of the ubiquitous internet, rather nonsensical.\nIndeed, suppression and non-publication orders from the courts increasingly take on a ludicrous quality, where locally based mainstream publishers and broadcasters with significant assets lie down and abide by judicial edicts, while those with one finger on a social media app blissfully ignore them.\nOne law for big publishers and no law for everyone else. It\u2019s as though we are in Fantasia, where a large proportion of the population know something that they are not supposed to know.\nSuch was the case with Pell\u2019s conviction. Some of the big media outlets in this country gave us a whiff that there was something in the public interest going on that could not be reported, with headlines like \u201cCensored\u201d, \u201cSecret scandal\u201d and so on.\nMeanwhile, it became evident that the internet does not stop at the sovereign borders of the nation. Online publishers beyond the writ of the county court of Victoria were doing their level best to pump out the story. Among the notable reports were those by the Washington Post, the Daily Beast (which was published and then geo-blocked) and a US Jesuit news site.\nThe grapevine effect was up and running \u2013 so much for the holy writ of suppression orders.\nFollowing the publication of those teasing headlines \u2013 after Pell\u2019s conviction on the choirboy charges \u2013 there was a tense session in the county court in which the chief judge, Peter Kidd, and the director of public prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC, expressed their concern that the suppression order may have been breached \u2013 even without Pell being identified directly.\nSince then the office of the Victorian DPP has notified media organisations, along with some of their senior editorial employees, that she is \u201cconsidering charges\u201d for sub-judice contempt and scandalising the court.\nThe Melbourne lawyer Justin Quill, from Macpherson Kelley, is acting for a combined group of media organisations who will defend the charges, including the Nine newspapers and TV outlets, News Corp, Channel Ten, Mamamia and Macquarie Media.\nAs many as 100 editors, online content people and journalists are potentially in the frame.\nAgain, the contempt case against the media seems like a fantastical disconnect with events as they transpired. Ultimately, the second trial was not prejudiced because it didn\u2019t take place and that was not due to any prejudicial reporting.\nThe state of Victoria has a bit of a love affair with suppression orders, issuing them at more than twice the rate of New South Wales, which is a bigger jurisdiction with larger courts, more cases and more judges.\nThe statistics on this have been carefully collected by Gina McWilliams, senior legal counsel at News Corp in Sydney.\nOne ready explanation is that there is an ingrained knee-jerk response to applications for suppression or no-publication orders among Victoria\u2019s judiciary, extending to saving people from \u201cembarrassment\u201d, or on grounds of poor health, or because it might make the job of the police simpler.\nMany of these orders are a direct affront to open justice, freedom of the media and the community\u2019s right to know what is happening in the courts and society generally. They are often-times made unaccompanied by adequate reasons and there is plenty of difficulty finding out if and when they have been lifted.\nFreedom of speech is supposed to be an article of faith in a democracy, key components of which are the rule of law and an independent media. Americans, more than most, hold it in high regard because they have a constitution that protects reporting on matters of public importance. In fact, if the Pell trial were held in the US it would be unconstitutional to suppress reporting of the proceedings.\nIncreasingly, in common-law countries without constitutional free-speech protections, the law and the media clash. The \u201cinterests\u201d of justice can be inimical to a free press.\nJust before the 2016 criminal trial of Eddie Obeid, the NSW DPP asked the media to stop publishing the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s widely known findings about the disgraced former state minister. Further, it attached a spreadsheet of 1,800 online news articles about Obeid which it said should be taken down from internet archives.\nIn another Victorian case, the Securency banknote bribery trial of 2014, the supreme court, on an application from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Open Courts Act, suppressed the names of 17 leading political and government figures in the region. These included \u201cany current or former prime minister of Malaysia\u201d, the president of Vietnam and the president of Indonesia and his predecessor.\nThis was a super-injunction, whose very existence was suppressed, yet WikiLeaks believed the information important enough to publish, and was content to ignore the terms of the court\u2019s order. It issued a press release via its Twitter account and the super-injunction was thereby rendered \u201cfutile\u201d.\nThe tech giants also appear to be significantly immune from the long arm of the courts. Last year Google breached a New Zealand court order suppressing publication of the name of the alleged accused in the murder of the English tourist Grace Millane.\nAnd it it is not just the media nipping at the skirts of judges. Parliament on occasion has had the temerity to challenge the orders of the judiciary.\nIn the UK, parliament was the forum for the outing of English footballers who got the courts to keep their extramarital affairs out of the \u201cred tops\u201d. In the case of Sir Philip Green, the wealthy businessman who persuaded the master of the rolls to enforce non-disclosure agreements with several of his sexual harassment victims, it was Peter Hain who, in the House of Lords, put everyone out of their speculative misery by naming Green as the man who could not be named.\nWhile the rest of the world has moved on and embraced the internet and its copious supply of information, the courts are stuck in another place. Can the jury system exist alongside an internet where information flows freely? Can judges admit that the internet exists? Do injunctions have a sensible place in the internet age?\nShort of getting rid of juries completely, jurors could be sequestered like mushrooms in a dark place without newspapers and the internet, while the rest of us get on with having access to important public interest information. The idea that the administration of justice should take precedence over society\u2019s right to know is an idea whose time has run out.\nTo make orders significantly beyond the power of judicial enforcement in this country smacks of futility. And for courts to engage in acts of futility is an embarrassment.",

        "content": "PM to offer his controversial taxpayer underwriting program for new power generation projects\nThe Morrison government will flag a willingness to use its controversial taxpayer underwriting program for new power generation projects to boost Tasmania\u2019s \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d proposal.\nThe prime minister will, as part of this week\u2019s attempted climate policy pivot, travel to Tasmania on Wednesday to underscore commonwealth support for the project, after promising $56m earlier this week for a second interconnector to deliver Tasmania\u2019s renewable energy to the mainland.\nMorrison will on Wednesday commit the commonwealth to developing an underwriting mechanism for the \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d project, declaring the proposal will \u201chelp cut power prices and put an end to the sorts of recent blackouts that families and businesses have had to suffer through\u201d.\nBut a feasibility study for the Tasmanian interconnector proposal now being supported by the government makes it clear the benefits are greater \u201cwhen approximately 7,000MW of the national electricity market\u2019s present coal-fired generation capacity retires\u201d.\nThat study says: \u201cThe largest single influencing factor in the economic feasibility and timing of Marinus Link is the trajectory of coal-fired generation retirement in the national electricity market.\u201d\nWhile the success of the Tasmanian interconnector is predicated on coal retirements, the government has signalled on many occasions it could help bring new coal plants into the market \u2013 ironically using the the same underwriting program that it has now flagged using with the massive, on-demand, renewable energy program in Tasmania.\nThe energy minister, Angus Taylor, has also left open indemnifying new plants from the risk of a future carbon price.\nThe coal baron Trevor St Baker has put in an expression of interest to the government\u2019s underwriting program, proposing two new coal plants at a cost of $6bn.\nAlinta has also submitted a proposal for a gas-fired power plant at Reeves Plains in South Australia, a pumped hydro project in New South Wales and a \u201cmarginal improvement\u201d to its Loy Yang B coal power plant in Victoria.\nThe government pulled its much vaunted \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation during the last sitting fortnight because it did not want to accept an amendment from Labor and the Greens that would have stopped the commonwealth providing taxpayer support for coal.\nAs well as accelerating commonwealth involvement in the Tasmanian project to try to burnish the Coalition\u2019s climate credentials for voters concerned about the government\u2019s record, Morrison on Tuesday also confirmed the much mooted Snowy 2.0 expansion would proceed with a capital injection from the commonwealth of $1.38bn.\nLabor has asked to see the business case for the Snowy expansion before it gives it bipartisan support, and there are also questions about expensive upgrades to transmission infrastructure that will be required to make the project fully operational.\nPaul Broad, the chief executive of Snowy Hydro, told Guardian Australia in an interview it was not up to him to supply the full business case to Labor. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the government to give things to the opposition, it is not up to me,\u201d he said.\nBroad said the company had put as much material as it could into the public domain about the proposal \u201cwithout giving away our commercial advantage\u201d.\nSnowy Hydro\u2019s materials confirms the costs associated with upgrading the shared transmission network, previously estimated by them at between $1bn and $2bn, have not been included in the 2.0 project costs. The company says it will fund \u201cshallow connection\u201d works to connect its generation to the shared network, but not the major upgrades.\nSnowy has now called for two major transmission line upgrades to be brought forward, and Broad admits if the required upgrades don\u2019t happen, Snowy 2.0 will not be fully operational.\nBroad says the upgrades are needed for a broader purpose than simply making the 2.0 expansion operational. \u201cTransmission is needed today,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe had blackouts in Melbourne the other day and we had 1,500 or 1,600MW sitting in New South Wales that we couldn\u2019t get into Victoria because we are constrained today in transmission. Isn\u2019t that stupid? Our networks need upgrading.\n\u201cWith Liddell closing, we have a significant amount of energy from Snowy today that we could get into the Sydney basin but we are constrained by transmission today. We argue transmission has got to be resolved for lots of reasons by lots of players \u2013 not only Snowy.\u201d\nHe said he was confident the 2.0 expansion could compete with any new coal plant underwritten by taxpayers, but said he wasn\u2019t in the business of predicting what the government might do.",

        "content": "I recognised the pattern: owners failing upwards and everyone else cleaning up the mess\nTo the average viewer, the story of Fyre festival \u2013 the disastrous luxury music festival narrated in two recent documentaries \u2013 seemed like an extreme example of incompetence and greed.\nBut there are many, many companies like Fyre out there. And for those of us who have worked for one of them, the films offer a depressingly familiar depiction of the smoke-and-mirrors nature of the entire industry.\nThe tech startup and digital media world is a place where talking a good game can get you a long way. The most memorable examples are the most extreme: remember Theranos, whose \u201crevolutionary\u201d blood-testing equipment promised to run a suite of tests on a single drop of blood, but \u2026 didn\u2019t? Or Juicero, whose fancy juicer proved superfluous once an enterprising journalist realised you could just squeeze the packs of crushed fruit yourself? Or Clinkle, a company lampooned for raising an astonishing amount of money on the basis of one promotional video (sound familiar?) \u2013 despite nobody knowing what its app actually did?\nBut even beyond the extremes, in which the incompetence (or fraud) is so blatant that someone ends up in jail, there\u2019s a pattern: some smooth-talking \u201cvisionary\u201d manages to convince some VC people to turn on the money tap. A bunch of staff are hired, worked to absurd schedules on promises of \u201cchanging the world\u201d. Any problems are met with aggressive, borderline-delusional positivity. And eventually, all the manifesting and mindfulness and life-coaching in the world can\u2019t mask the fact that the \u201crevolutionary\u201d blood-testing apparatus doesn\u2019t work, or the payment app does precisely nothing that other payment apps don\u2019t do already, or the festival doesn\u2019t have any bands. Or accommodation. Or food. (Or water.)\nFrom 2013-17, I worked for another NYC-based digital media startup \u2013 and watching the Fyre documentaries filled me with a sort of shudder-inducing deja vu.\nI recognised the hangdog, beaten-down expression of all of founder Billy McFarland\u2019s employees: the creeping realisation that we were working ourselves to death for a company whose business model simply didn\u2019t work.\nThe Soho loft-style office we inhabited was renovated at great expense by the company, which didn\u2019t own the space \u2013 which, well, I\u2019ll leave you to think about the financial wisdom of that. It turned out to be much too big for us, so we shared it with various ill-fated startups, which meant we got to watch the boom-and-bust cycle play out time after time.\nPerhaps the most memorable of these doomed startups sticks in the mind for one reason: its icon. Dear god, the icon. Today \u2013 in a development that is perhaps the best for all concerned \u2013 it is nowhere to be found on the internet, so I\u2019ve had to draw it from memory. It looked like ... this:\nIt was supposed to look like someone holding a phone to their ear, I guess? The app launched with much fanfare, and sank with little. At the time, it seemed perversely reassuring for our own business: we might be flying by the seat of our pants, but at least we hadn\u2019t launched an app with a logo that looked like a man either vomiting into his own lap, or performing an act that, according to legend, requires the removal of several ribs.\nUnfortunately it transpired that we had more in common with our office-mates than we thought. Of course, this is the fundamental problem with digital media: nobody knows how to make any money. Traditionally, media has profited by selling its product to either customers or advertisers, and preferably both. Digital media does precisely none of the former, and increasingly little of the latter. It\u2019s a worry: as print media declines, digital media becomes more and more the place we turn for journalism. And journalism isn\u2019t profitable.\nThis means digital media companies end up staying afloat the same way tech startups do: with, ahem, innovative business models. They guzzle on VC funding in the hope that it\u2019ll keep the lights on long enough for them to a) finally work out how to make the whole thing viable, or, more likely, b) be sold to a larger, more profitable company. Ideally the sale happens when the company is at its peak, allowing the owners to cash out handsomely \u2013 like when Facebook bought WhatsApp. Failing that, a sale can still happen when the company is nearly (or actually) bankrupt \u2013 one example here is Gawker, and another my former employer.\nEither way, the transaction is usually followed by a round of layoffs, and the discovery by the remaining staff that they suddenly have a whole lot more work to do and a whole lot less time to do it. (Employees of Mic, most recently, are nodding forlornly at this point.)\nThere\u2019s a bit at the end of the Netflix Fyre festival documentary where McFarland tells his staff that they\u2019re not going to be laid off; instead, they\u2019re just ... not going to get money for a while. \u201cSo,\u201d marvels one of his long-suffering employees, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to lay us off, which [would] allow us to apply for unemployment benefits. You just aren\u2019t gonna pay us any more, making us quit ourselves.\u201d\nMcFarland stutters for a moment, then replies, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of how this impacts employment benefits.\u201d\nYou couldn\u2019t ask for a more perfect summary of the divide that lies at the heart of digital media, between the fairyland of marketing videos and investment decks and the very real effect that the reams of bullshit therein have on people\u2019s lives. Fyre was particularly objectionable because of the way its failure\u2019s effects extended to those even less able to carry the can for a terrible idea: the Bahamians left unpaid and out of pocket.\nBut even in less extreme examples, the pattern remains: the owners fail upwards and everyone else is left to clean up the mess.\n Tom Hawking is a freelance writer based in Melbourne",

Welfare groups and some providers argue this has led to a blowout in payment suspensions. Guardian Australia revealed earlier this month that one in five participants had received a payment suspension in six months.\nIn another de-identified submission, the father of two children with autism said he had been handed a \u201cgeneric\u201d plan, which required him to take his daughter to a story-time session.\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s diagnosis means this is poorly suited to her,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI explained and was ignored when I detailed the time commitments I already have. For example, in the 25 business days preceding the appointment \u2026 I had to attend 23 separate medical appointments with/for various family members.\n\u201cI requested a follow-up appointment to resolve this. Whilst waiting the week for my return interview, my payment was cut for noncompliance with the plan.\u201d\nA submission from Mission Australia said in some cases participants could be required to attend appointments more than 75km away.\nAnother mother of two told her provider she had been left in tears at the supermarket because she was unable to pay for her groceries, according to Mission Australia\u2019s submission. Providers have previously warned they were referring clients to food banks due to payment suspensions.\nThe Brotherhood of Laurence submission noted a departmental technical glitch had led to increased payment suspensions in November, while there were \u201ccountless examples\u201d of Centrelink booking appointments at short notice, leading to potential payment suspensions.\nThe majority of the more than 60 submissions called for the program to be decoupled from the government\u2019s new welfare compliance regime. Many also argued the program should be made voluntary.\nSome providers did praise the aims of the program, which is designed to get parents ready to enter employment when their children reach school age.\nThe Department of Jobs and Small Business did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.\nThe department will appear before the inquiry on Wednesday.",

        "content": "Our hard drives are full of all kinds of clutter, but you can\u2019t hold those files in your hands to see if they spark joy\nLeaving a long-term relationship, you find yourself standing on the precipice of a life yet unlived; all of a sudden the accumulated trinkets and tchotchkes of\u200b your life together exist only to mock you in your unspoken grief. There\u2019s no better time to get into getting rid of stuff.\nAfter she emptied our house of all \u200bthat she wanted, I emptied it a second time, of everything that we had grown to want together. I embraced the spartan wisdom of Marie Kondo\u2019s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up \u2013 the self-help manual de rigueur for people who want to want less. Like a barren arctic island basking in my daily hour of sunlight, I proudly embraced an aesthetic of Scandinavian noir-chic, telling anyone within earshot that the drab palette and multiple timber-veneer Arkelstorp side tables were the trappings of a new and more mature me, a me that was as comfortable owning six oversized beige floor lamps and playing at underwear origami as I was being alone.\nA brutalist of the inner world, Kondo imagines a life made better for being purposeful in its scantness \u2013 a message that does not bode well for the abode of one married to their clutter, but I latch on to her philosophy hook, line and sinker. I fold each of my socks, throw away projects that sit half finished, and appraise the emotional bond I share with my cutlery. I begin to feel like maybe it\u2019s actually working. Minimalism feels like a scam until you\u2019re in on it, and isn\u2019t that what scams are all about now?\nBut for all the physical detritus in our orbit, what exists on our computers is vaster and more vague; a digital footprint compressed deep. There isn\u2019t a guidebook for emotional digital minimalism. No one tells you how to hold a file in your hand, to embrace a 100KB photograph, to evaluate whether a 10-year text-message history \u201csparks joy\u201d.\nIt\u2019s been estimated that the trillions of electrons that make up the entire internet weigh about 50 grams, around half the weight of a pack of cards. But what about the emotional weight of keeping terabytes of photographs you took of someone while you loved them? What was the feeling of deleting them? More than anything, I felt the need to find out.\nWe all curate ourselves on the internet, whether you\u2019re an aspiring influencer, KonMari-ing your Twitter followers, or demanding the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. But we are increasingly sold the unassailable notion that behind the scenes no such maintenance is required. The cloud is infinite, a fluffy Sunday-school afterlife for our digital debris. Google promises me more space than I could once even fathom, Dropbox will allocate me huge tracts of land on their digital acreage, and Apple pinky-swears that every blurry photo of a dog, cloud or my pink, bared arse will remain safe forever, as long as I cough up to keep their labyrinthine server compound spinning.\nI begin a pilgrimage. Every photo ever taken, every file saved \u2013 my digital history up for appraisal. Years of work and pleasure have become a formless sweater, taking months to unravel, each day finding myself tugging ever tighter in the cold. What at the start is a careful evaluation, trying to consider each file as I had my teaspoons and shower gel, grows increasingly fast and unfeeling. In one marathon session, equipment tests and engagement parties alike flick past in seconds, as I pick out the smattering of photos deemed worthy, before transferring the rest into a growing folder of refuse.\nI tell all my friends about this journey, and their responses vary wildly. Some find my task Sisyphean but fascinating. Others do not understand, and openly revel in the automaticity of the cloud. Not making decisions, they say, is how they find the time to make other, more important decisions. Mostly they tell me that they wouldn\u2019t have the time, with the kind of look that betrays their concern that I do.\nOne friend tells me of how once, in the days before Facebook, she lost a hard drive containing the entire photographic history of her and an ex; how it felt like a cleaving, a blade cutting clean through tender flesh. This sort of thing could never happen nowadays, she muses, and I think of all that data I have no control over. Somewhere out there, pinging off a distant cloud, is the first time I met you, the first time I blurted out, \u201cI love you\u201d, the first time you saw my tits. Somewhere too is the last thing you ever said to me, preserved until the end of time, or until the ad revenue runs dry.\nI realise too, as the months drag on, that this process is framing and changing how I interact with the content that I create and curate now. Meals are prepared and eaten unphotographed. Conversations carry on with no one sneaking their phones for posterity. I watch sunsets fade into darkness until the night chill sends me indoors, my phone unthinkingly left atop one of my five Arkelstorps. My memory has never been good, but I make more room in my head for moments that feel significant, and the moments I do share with people are more valuable in turn.\nOne day I realise there are no more files to sort through, no more junk data, and all that\u2019s left is one big folder full of all those split-second decisions. I\u2019m back at the beginning, trying to quantify what this means, what this feels like. The boxes have slowly emptied out of the rental we once shared, the last of her self-help books ready to take on a new life outside of this ghost house, and yet this folder lingers, like it\u2019s waiting for me to commit. Then, on a whim, it\u2019s time. There is no more use in deliberating, and I move to delete it.\nI pause, cursor hovered over the trash as though I\u2019m holding these 50,000-odd photographs cupped in my hands. It is finally tangible. It feels like this deserves some kind of ritual, or a moment of peace. I wait to experience anything in this moment, but there\u2019s nothing there, so I just let go. Right click, Empty Trash \u2013 taking a final leaf from The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, before I give it away too.\n This is an edited version of the article Clear History: Digital Minimalism, published by literary magazine Kill Your Darlings",

In South Australia, and in Western Australia, it was just over 30%.\u201d\n\u201cWithin states, opportunity is also uneven. In Melbourne, university attainment is around 45% \u2013 in Mildura, it is just 17.3%.\u201d\nGardner says the statistics are a \u201cpowerful reminder\u201d of the need for a demand-driven system of university admissions, a system Plibersek credits with boosting country enrolments by 48% since 2009.\nPlibersek will commit the opposition to \u201ctake strong action to ensure city kids and country kids have the same opportunity to get a uni education\u201d.\n\u201cA young person from the north shore of Sydney is four times more likely to have a degree than someone in [the] outback [Northern Territory].\n\u201cLabor will do everything possible to dismantle this education divide.\u201d\nPlibersek will commit to $3.2m for mentoring and tutorials to \u201cbuild confidence and aspiration\u201d in country students to encourage them to go to university or technical and further education.\nThe program will be delivered in 22 regional study hubs, 16 of which have already been promised by the education minister, Dan Tehan, and a further six are to be created if Labor is elected.\n\u201cLabor will also appoint a dedicated regional and remote commissioner to advise our once in a generation national inquiry into post-secondary education,\u201d Plibersek says.\n\u201cThe commissioner will be responsible for developing strategies and policies to support country students, as well as our regional unis and Tafes.\n\u201cThat work will include a close look at how funding and regulation can boost participation in post-secondary education in every region of Australia.\u201d\nIn a review released in January 2018, Prof John Halsey recommended the government do more to help rural, regional and remote students make transitions from school to university, training and employment, including by improving the availability of high-quality work experience placements.\nGardner will also release new statistics that in 2017, 451,263 students took part in 555,403 workplace learning activities as part of their studies, such as work placements (43%) or projects (23%).\nIn a foreword to the Universities Australia report, Tehan described work-integrated learning as a \u201cwin-win for students and employers\u201d.\n\u201cThe federal government is providing record funding to Australia\u2019s universities, and the return on that investment is job-ready graduates who can take advantage of the employment opportunities our economy is creating.\u201d\nIn November the Morrison government announced $135m for regional universities, study hubs and scholarships for students in regional and rural areas, but was immediately criticised for taking the money from base research funding.\nLabor has promised to restore the demand-driven system, ending the $2.2bn two-year freeze on commonwealth payments to universities and called for an extra $300m spending on university research facilities.",

        "content": "Queen Anne, as seen in The Favourite, had expensive tastes \u2013 lobster-racing doesn\u2019t come cheap. But other royals gave her a run for her money\nThe reign of Queen Anne, like most of the 18th century, used to be ignored \u2013 a dull period in between the Glorious Revolution and the Napoleonic war. Now, suddenly, thanks to Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s startling film The Favourite and Olivia Colman\u2019s portrayal of the capricious, rabbit-loving, lesbian queen, she is everywhere.\nHer latest incarnation is as a spendthrift. A report from the archives of Blenheim Palace \u2013 home of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, the eponymous royal \u201cfavourite\u201d until she was displaced in the queen\u2019s affections by her cousin Abigail Masham \u2013 suggests that Anne\u2019s personal expenditure between 1708 and 1711 amounted to \u00a312m in today\u2019s money. Large sums were spent on drinking chocolate \u2013 a luxury at the time \u2013 and much has been made of the fee of \u00a310 and 15 shillings (worth about \u00a32,250 today) handed over to someone described as a \u201cmad Spaniard\u201d.\nOn the surface, this does not look good for Queen Anne. But is \u00a33m a year really so extravagant for a monarch? \u201cWhat royals spend is always lavish compared with what average people spend,\u201d says Ophelia Field, author of the 2002 biography of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough (the book is also called The Favourite). \u201cThere was a bigger difference then between the queen and the average person, but Queen Anne certainly doesn\u2019t have a reputation for extravagance. If anything, Sarah [as keeper of the privy purse] was criticised for not dressing her lavishly enough. There were people who thought her management of the queen\u2019s personal accounts was too tight.\u201d\nSo, who should get the title of Britain\u2019s most extravagant monarch? Field points out that James I and Charles II spent liberally. George IV topped a poll conducted by English Heritage in 2008 to find \u201cBritain\u2019s worst monarch\u201d. \u201cHis lazy, spendthrift nature and unpleasantness to his wife, Queen Caroline, seems to have won him the accolade,\u201d said the historian Andrew Roberts.\nHenry VIII was even more extravagant, obsessed with expensive ceremonials, banquets and pricey (or bloody) divorces.\nThe early 13th-century monarch King John also has strong claims in a crowded field. He was so profligate that he was unable to pay his mercenary army, and was forced to increase taxes, thus annoying his barons and setting off the chain of events that led to Magna Carta. Royal extravagance as the driver of history \u2013 Queen Anne\u2019s taste for lobster racing can\u2019t compete with that.",

The Met Office defines winter from the beginning of December to the end of February, so Tuesday\u2019s sunny spell is also a winter record.\nThe record had already been broken on Monday, when temperatures exceeded 20C during winter for the very first time. This week\u2019s unseasonably warm weather differs dramatically from the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country.\nThe previous winter record had been 19.7C in Greenwich, south-east London, in 1998.\n\u201cThe average temperature for this time of year is 9C in London and 9C in north Wales, so what we\u2019re seeing is 10 degrees above average,\u201d said Martin Bowles, a Met Office meteorologist.\nBowles said: \u201cWe can\u2019t blame climate change directly because we\u2019re talking about weather, not the climate. But it is a sign of climate change. There\u2019s been a gradual increase of temperatures over the last 30 years so the extreme weather has also been increasing.\u201d\nParts of Britain on Tuesday were hotter than Malibu, Athens, Crete and Barcelona.\nThe warm weather is in stark contrast to this time last year, when the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d swept across much of the UK, bringing heavy snow showers and lows of -5C. The cold conditions caused travel delays and power cuts in what were the lowest temperatures in the week leading up to 1 March since 1986.\nBowles said the warm temperatures were largely because of an area of pressure over the North Sea, which was drawing up warm air from the south.\nLast year\u2019s cold weather was because of a similar weather pattern, but the high pressure came from Arctic Russia, before moving over Scandinavia. The conditions seen this week come from the tropical Atlantic and parts of north Africa.\nWhile temperatures are forecast to reach 19C on Wednesday, the Met Office is expecting to see a change from Thursday onwards, when weather from the Atlantic will bring colder showers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a very warm end to winter, but will see a typical beginning to spring,\u201d Bowles said\nHeavy showers are possible at the end of the week, as temperatures will struggle to get above 11C or 12C.",

        "content": "With enigmatic lyrics and aspirations to rival Shostakovich, Hollis considered himself the leader of a jazz band which should never stop innovating\nThe intricate orchestration and classical impulses of 1988\u2019s Spirit of Eden and 1991\u2019s Laughing Stock cemented Talk Talk as musical visionaries. But the driving force behind these albums showed flashes of iconoclastic brilliance even on the group\u2019s most accessible, commercially successful early works.\nAt first, Mark Hollis and his Talk Talk bandmates \u2013 bassist Paul Webb, drummer Lee Harris and keyboardist Simon Brenner \u2013 employed subtle subversion. On Talk Talk\u2019s 1982 full-length debut, the sophisti-pop totem The Party\u2019s Over, the band assumed the role of new wave tastemakers indebted to Japan and Roxy Music, courtesy of moody bass lines, whimsical keyboards, and compact arrangements. Yet Hollis\u2019s lyrics, which contained allusions to religious imagery, as well as ruminations on betrayal, social upheaval and identity, hinted at far darker and more substantial matters.\nThe stormy, wise title track expressed agony about the negative consequences of ageing and time\u2019s unstoppable march, while the song Talk Talk crisply admonished an unfaithful partner. Hollis\u2019s early band, the Reaction, had already released a gloriously bratty punk version of the latter under the title Talk Talk Talk Talk on the 1977 Beggars Banquet compilation Streets. But their 1982 take on the song adds nuance and depth, swapping out raucous guitars in favour of anxious keyboards, which temper the bitterness of the lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m not that blind to see that you\u2019ve been cheating on me.\u201d For good measure, Talk Talk also features a bridge driven by glassy, mellifluous piano and teeth-chattering drums: conveying uncertainty and anguish, both elements amplify the song\u2019s turbulent emotions.\nDespite obvious major differences \u2013 Talk Talk had no guitarist circa The Party\u2019s Over \u2013 the band was often compared to Duran Duran, much to Hollis\u2019s frustration. \u201cPeople who say that obviously haven\u2019t listened to us properly,\u201d he told Smash Hits in 1982. \u201cDuran Duran\u2019s overall sound is just bass drum.\u201d (After news of Hollis\u2019s death broke, Simon Le Bon called him \u201cone of music\u2019s great innovators\u201d in a Facebook statement.) Still, the association between the two groups wasn\u2019t out of left field. The bands shared a label and toured together, and Talk Talk\u2019s album was produced by Colin Thurston, who also helmed Duran Duran\u2019s breakthrough, Rio. Plus, the murky synths creeping through Talk Talk\u2019s Have You Heard the News and the pulsating disco-pop single Another Word are reminiscent of Duran Duran, while Webb\u2019s nimble bass lines bubbled up to the surface of Talk Talk\u2019s music much in the same way John Taylor\u2019s did.\nHollis\u2019s irritation makes more sense when considering that his actual musical inspirations (and aspirations) were much loftier. In early interviews, he discussed Debussy and Shostakovich in relation to his creative process; he frequently cited Otis Redding as a vocal influence (\u201che combines real power with tenderness,\u201d he told Smash Hits in 1982), and heaped praise on John Coltrane\u2019s arrangements and the songwriting skills of Burt Bacharach. \u201cAs for contemporaries, I can\u2019t actually listen to things like the Human League because they\u2019ve been played to death,\u201d Hollis continued. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ve made really good ground.\u201d\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Hollis also didn\u2019t necessarily consider Talk Talk to be a new-wave band. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a rhythm section to provide the beat, and keyboards to provide the melody, which they can do much better than a guitar,\u201d he told NME in 1982. \u201cIn a way, the line-up is closer to a jazz quartet than a rock band.\u201d In a nod to jazz\u2019s penchant for instrumental fluidity, Hollis was also deeply unsentimental about Talk Talk\u2019s musical direction at any given time. \u201cEach album should be a definite move on from the one before it,\u201d he pronounced to Electronic Soundmaker & Computer Music in 1984.\nAs a result, Talk Talk welcomed new collaborators for the 1984 LP It\u2019s My Life with open arms. After the departure of keyboardist Simon Brenner, Hollis and the band recruited guitarist Robbie McIntosh (then of the Pretenders and later a member of Paul McCartney\u2019s band), pianist Phil Ramacon and keyboardist Ian Curnow. More notably, the band struck up a partnership with Tim Friese-Greene, whose songwriting and production contributions steered Talk Talk toward a fuller, more organic take on contemporary synth-pop. This emboldened Hollis to affect a sophisticated croon that exuded more emotional range \u2013 as on the sleek title track, a desperate treatise about being resigned to a doomed relationship that topped the US dance charts and ended up as Talk Talk\u2019s only American Top 40 hit.\nYet although It\u2019s My Life sounded of its time, with its funky bass hiccups, manipulated synthesisers and jagged guitar streaks, the album also pushed against contemporary limitations. Such a Shame starts with an extended instrumental intro marked by the sound of trumpeting elephants, sampled by the band themselves after-hours at a local zoo; overlapping vocals orbit Dum Dum Girl, creating a disorienting stereo effect; and muted trumpet adds shadows to the brooding, sparse ballad Renee. The lyrics are existential and fatalistic, if enigmatic, enhancing the vibe.\nWhile 1986\u2019s The Colour of Spring is often cited as Talk Talk\u2019s sonic pivot, It\u2019s My Life more obviously presaged and enabled Hollis\u2019s future atmospheric explorations. Most notably, the album\u2019s international success gave Hollis the financial means to pursue a more unorthodox sonic direction. \u201cIn terms of the first two albums and the live field, synths are simply an economic measure,\u201d he told Home and Recording Studio. \u201cBeyond that, I absolutely hate synthesisers. To me the only good thing about them was the fact that they gave you large areas of sound to work with: apart from that they\u2019re really bad \u2013 horrible.\u201d\nToday, Talk Talk\u2019s later work receives much more praise and attention; a 2012 tribute, Spirit of Talk Talk, largely shied away from the band\u2019s first two albums. (One notable exception is No Doubt\u2019s keyboard-drenched 2003 cover of It\u2019s My Life, a massive international hit that amplified the original song\u2019s seething melancholy and vocal drama.) Yet The Party\u2019s Over and It\u2019s My Life deserve a more prominent place in conversation about Talk Talk\u2019s greatness. In hindsight, these albums reveal clearly that Hollis was playing a musical long game from the very start of his career, driven by a steadfast creative vision rooted in unwavering self-confidence and relentless forward motion.",

And, from the Oscars to the catwalks, the high-collared silhouette still reigns supreme\nWhen one look unites the Oscars, fashion weeks across two very different cities and the legacy of two fashion superstars \u2013 Karl Lagerfeld and the American socialite Lee Radziwill \u2013 well, then we have ourselves a bona fide trend.\nThe real fashion takeaway from Gemma Chan\u2019s Valentino Oscars dress wasn\u2019t the flamingo pink, but the elongated ruffled neck. The high collar ruled the night. Olivia Colman\u2019s stately forest-green Prada dress had a polo neck, as did the va-va-voom Tom Ford sheath worn by Jennifer Lopez. Likewise, the avant-garde structured black tunic chosen by Helen Lasichanh, the very chic wife of Pharrell Williams, and Irina Shayk\u2019s dramatic open-back black dress. Very different gowns, but all with a to-the-chin neckline.\nThe high-fashion high neck is snowballing momentum. When Radziwill died on the first day of London fashion week, fashionista Instagram feeds were full of images of her: in a white polo neck under a blazer on the streets of Paris, with a silk scarf wound tight and high around her neck in the front row of a New York show. And then, as if by osmosis, the same outlines seeped on to the catwalks. At Victoria Beckham\u2019s show the first look, with a red foulard whisked around the neck above a shoulder-robed windowpane blazer, had a cool east coast chic of which Radziwill would definitely have approved. At Erdem, swan-necked polo necks under bejewelled cashmere cardigans were worn with low kitten heels. Very recently retired ballerina; very Radziwill. At Roksanda, the ultra-high necklines of evening dresses were accentuated with a collar of feathers.\nThe death of Lagerfeld threw a long shadow \u2013 complete with distinctive high-collared silhouette \u2013 over Milan fashion week. At Fendi, where Lagerfeld designed for 54 years, the exaggerated pointed collars, starched high-rise necklines and starched bows had models adopting Lagerfeld\u2019s signature pose of a haughtily uptilted chin on the catwalk. But the high neckline was not just a homage to Karl. At Gucci, models wore spiked chokers with polo neck sweaters or above a shirt and tie. These will not go on sale \u2013 \u201ca little dangerous\u201d, designer Alessandro Michele explained in his post-show press conference \u2013 but were there to emphasise the neck as the focal point of this season\u2019s look. At Versace, the 90s-party-girl classic of a tissue-weight T-shirt under a slip dress was revived, but with polo necks wrinkling right up to the ears under lace-trimmed minis.\nIt is now necklines, not hemlines, that make headline news in fashion. When the economist George Taylor invented the Hemline Index in 1926, theorising that short skirts reflected a buoyant economy, his logic was that in more affluent times, women choose shorter hemlines to show off their silk stockings; when times are lean, they want longer skirts to cover up the lack of them.\nGiven that \u201cshowing off your silk stockings\u201d went out before shillings and pence \u2013 and bearing in mind that the esteemed fashion historian Valerie Steele dated the debunking of the hemline index back to 1927, when hemlines began to fall two years before the stock market crash \u2013 it is amazing how long the index has hung on as urban legend. (Also, a bit patronising: \u201cYou are only girls and can therefore only talk about the economy if we explain it in terms of pretty dresses.\u201d) Fashion has diversified to the point where there is no dictated skirt length any more. Longer skirts have dominated catwalks for most of the past decade, but not exclusively \u2013 see Balmain \u2013 and rather than the stock market, the shift reflects a more globalised fashion economy that serves non-western cultural norms, and the growing profile of older women as customers.\nThe polo neck has been to this decade what the miniskirt was to the 1960s. In March 2011, Phoebe Philo put a white polo neck on her Celine runway and put the high, sleek neckline back on the map. Polo necks have been layered under crew neck sweaters, hoodies and cotton shirts. The stand-up neckline has even spawned a new hairstyle: the polo neck tuck, where hair is funnelled inside a knit, turning long hair into a quasi-bob. After reigning over us for eight years, the high neck might be expected to be on the slide \u2013 instead, it is coming into its prime. The high neck is no longer a quiet underlayer, but the main event. Those Gucci spikes won\u2019t be coming to a high street near you any time soon, but look out for a silk scarf wound into an elaborate bow, or a starched Karl-esque evening blouse, or a collar of feathers, or a zipped-to-the-chin funnel neck bomber.\nA neckline has always spoken of status. Think of the white roman collar, or dog collar, worn by priests. The old school tie. The string of pearls. The white collar, and the blue. Your dress can be whatever length you like because it\u2019s what happens at the throat that counts. This season, it\u2019s time to put your neck on the line.",

        "content": "In the run-up to the 2011 World Cup, the All Blacks held a series of \u201cWhat if?\u201d meetings. \u201cWe talked about worst-case scenarios,\u201d Jerome Kaino remembered, \u201cand Kieran Read said: \u2018The worst would be if Dan Carter and Richie McCaw get injured.\u2019\u201d The head coach, Graham Henry, didn\u2019t really think that would happen \u2013 \u201csurely not possible\u201d he told himself \u2013 but he wanted to plan for it anyway. After New Zealand were knocked out by France in 2007, Henry had spent a lot of time thinking about what went wrong. He decided his team had been caught short when everything took a turn for the worse. So he became a doomsday prepper.\nIn their 2007 quarter-final in Cardiff, the All Blacks were thrown by the referee, yes, who hardly gave a decision their way, but by some critical injuries, too. Carter went off after 56 minutes, his replacement, Nick Evans, after 71. Henry felt that, without either of their two first\u2011choice fly-halves, his team had become like \u201ca possum in the headlights\u201d. So for 2011, Henry\u2019s philosophy was to expect the unexpected. He wanted his coaches and players to feel ready for anything. \u201cSay McCaw breaks his leg in the first minute of the final, what happens then?\u201d Henry said. \u201cHow do you handle that?\u201d\nIn the end, McCaw didn\u2019t break his leg but his foot, and he played on anyway. Carter, who tore a tendon in his thigh while he was practising his kicking, wasn\u2019t so lucky. When he dropped out of the tournament, Henry moved Carter\u2019s understudy Colin Slade into the first team and brought his first reserve Aaron Cruden into the squad. Then, when Slade tore a muscle in his groin playing against Argentina, Henry promoted Cruden into the first team and called up Stephen Donald. And when Cruden twisted his knee half an hour into the final, Donald came on and eventually won the game, 8-7 against France.\nHenry doesn\u2019t claim he had all this exactly mapped out but all that contingency planning meant they were in the best position to cope with this Job\u2019s lot of bad luck. Henry was criticised for the way he had rotated his squad in 2009 and 2010 but the policy meant that by the end of 2011 he had four fly-halves who all had experience playing Test rugby. Donald already had 23 caps. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t had that All Black experience, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what he did,\u201d Henry said later. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make it easy but thank God we had a strategy for it.\u201d\nSeven months out from the World Cup, it feels as if Eddie Jones is still so busy working out through the best-case scenario that he hasn\u2019t had time to worry about the worst yet. Jones has built an England squad who are capable of beating anyone, so long as they have their key players fit, as they did against Ireland in Dublin at the beginning of the month. But then you get to those \u201cWhat ifs?\u201d. It\u2019s pretty easy to work out what the worst of these are. What if Owen Farrell suffers a concussion and Billy Vunipola breaks an arm? What if Mako Vunipola twists an ankle and Kyle Sinckler gets sent off?\nWhat is hard is figuring exactly what England will do if either, some, or all these things come true, which they likely will, given the casualty rate of your average World Cup campaign is something like that of a small Victorian war, and the fact England are now playing a style of rugby that requires a lunatic commitment to imposing themselves physically on the opposition. Because the gulf between England with and England without that band of their players is beginning to look like the difference between their winning the World Cup and being knocked out in the semi-finals.\nThey were without two of them, Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, when they lost to Wales on Saturday. Who knows what difference Vunipola\u2019s Stakhanovite tackle count and Itoje\u2019s we-go-again leadership would have made to a game that was balanced on a razor\u2019s edge for 78 minutes? The odd part was that Jones was so reluctant to use some of the other players he did have available, such as George Ford and Dan Robson, who were left on the bench. It was as if, already without one Vunipola and Itoje, Jones was determined he had to keep Farrell and Ben Youngs on the pitch just so England had a critical mass of those key players.\nOf course all teams are hostage to these twists of fate and fortune. But England, perhaps because they\u2019re only recently out of the slump they suffered last year, seem especially dependent on a small group of favoured players. Compare Jones\u2019s approach with, say, the way Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt has brought through Joey Carbery and Kieron Marmion as cover for his two key players, Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton, or how Warren Gatland has balanced his Wales selection so he has a choice of Gareth Anscombe and Dan Biggar at fly-half, or Taulupe Faletau and Ross Moriarty at No 8.\nJones surely knows all this. Like every international coach, he will have his depth chart, marking the pecking order of players in each position. But take the list at fly\u2011half. There\u2019s Farrell, and then Ford, who seems to be lucky to get off the bench, and beyond him, perhaps, Danny Cipriani, who has been frozen out since last summer. Or at scrum-half, where, after Youngs, Danny Care has been dropped from the squad and Robson can\u2019t seem to get a game.\nFew would deny that Jones has a first XV who are strong enough to win the World Cup in Japan. But unless they get very lucky, they will have to prove they can do it without them, too.",

        "content": "Businesses face a new June deadline, leaving those preparing for no deal in limbo\nDelaying Britain\u2019s departure from the EU would be better for the economy in the longer term \u2013 but the move could also have a damaging impact on firms that have spent two years preparing for a 29 March exit and now face the prospect of planning for a double cliff-edge, in March and June, business leaders have warned.\nCompanies across Britain now face the growing likelihood that the Brexit process could be delayed beyond the end of March, after Theresa May told parliament that MPs would get a vote on Thursday 14 March on extending the article 50 process \u2013 if the Commons has not passed a deal by then, and if MPs vote to reject no-deal.\nWhile that would postpone damage to the economy from crashing out on 29 March, it would not remove the risk of no-deal Brexit at a later date. Meanwhile, the continued cloud of uncertainty would act as a drag on the economy for a longer period.\nAhead of next month\u2019s vote on extending article 50, companies face the prospect of a potential double cliff-edge to plan around. It also comes after the government has in recent months issued repeated warnings telling firms to prepare for a no-deal Brexit next month.\nA spokeswoman for financial firms in the City warned that an extension to article 50 could leave firms in limbo. Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, welcomed the prime minister\u2019s plan but also warned that it must not be \u201ca bridge to nowhere\u201d. McGuinness said a deal was needed \u201cto enable City firms to plan for the future\u201d.\nLiberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said it was a \u201cpositive step\u201d that MPs would now have the chance to avoid a no-deal exit. But he added: \u201cRather than ending the uncertainty, the PM has instead created a potential double cliff-edge that businesses will need to plan for.\u201d\nBusinesses have spent the past two years preparing for a potential cliff-edge Brexit on 29 March, ramping up their planning in recent months as parliament has become increasingly gridlocked over the issue. Some observers said it was too late for companies to alter their plans.\nBMW has set out plans to shut its Mini plant for a month at the end of March to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts.\nMany businesses have raised their stockpiling efforts in recent months in anticipation of the March Brexit date, while others are relocating activities elsewhere within the EU or otherwise changing their plans.\nAlthough buying more political manoeuvring time and avoiding immediate harm to the economy, dragging out the article 50 process could have the perverse impact of weighing on economic growth. The British economy has come close to stalling over recent months, with analysts blaming the looming deadline.\nJames Smith, an economist at the City bank ING, said: \u201cA shorter extension might have short-term political and practical advantages, but it would likely be more damaging for the economy.\n\u201cA longer extension, while potentially more politically awkward for the UK government, could see growth recover a touch in the near-term as the imminent no-deal threat recedes.\u201d\nCarolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said avoiding no-deal Brexit at the end of March was essential, but added: \u201cTo avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate.\u201d\nMay told MPs that any extension was likely to be short and \u201calmost certainly \u2026 a one-off\u201d, potentially for only as long as until the end of June, so as to avoid Britain having to take part in European elections in summer.\nBusiness leaders said firms would need to continue with their planning, even if there was a potential deadline extension.\nClaire Walker, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce said: \u201cBusinesses still need to ensure they are preparing for all possible scenarios and government and its agencies must provide clear, precise and accurate information for all eventualities.\u201d",

        "content": "The singer\u2019s upcoming brand, created with French conglomerate LVMH, is named after her album, Loud, and will receive \u20ac60m in investment\nIn January, it was announced that Rihanna would become the first black female designer to have a label as part of the LVMH conglomerate. This week, it was revealed that the project has a name and multi-million euro funding.\nThe title of the venture is Project Loud France \u2013 named in honour of the singer\u2019s fifth album, Loud \u2013 and it has around \u20ac60m (\u00a350m) worth of investment split between Rihanna and the conglomerate, which also owns Louis Vuitton, Celine and Christian Dior. Rihanna will be a 49.99% shareholder.\nThis information was obtained by The Business of Fashion, who have had access to documents detailing the company\u2019s set-up. This is the first new brand the group has launched since Christian Lacroix in 1987. According to an article on their website, Rihanna has invested \u20ac2,998,800 (\u00a32,571,000) while LVMH have brought \u20ac30m (\u00a325m). This suggests there are high hopes that a Rihanna fashion brand is a project worth investing in. It has also been reported that Project Loud France is registered at the same address as LVMH Fashion Group, which looks after brands including Celine, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs.\nThis faith isn\u2019t, of course, just based on the reach of a celebrity. Rihanna\u2019s ability to connect with millennials and Gen Z consumers has been tried and tested in both beauty and fashion. Her Fenty Beauty line \u2013 which pioneered diversity by having first 40 and then 50 shades of foundation to cater to different skin tones \u2013 had consumers queuing outside stores to buy products. The brand reportedly generated $100m (\u00a375m) in the first 40 days after launch. It was first launched by Kendo, the LVMH initiative to develop beauty brands.\nHer Fenty fashion label, launched with Puma in 2015, has also been successful. The first trainers she designed sold out in 35 minutes, and she was credited, in part, with Puma\u2019s profits increasingly 92.2% in 2017. Savage x Fenty, her lingerie line launched in May 2018, has also been well received, with queues outside stores for products. The New York fashion week show in September was praised for diverse, body-positive casting and held up as an example of what a modern lingerie line looks like \u2013 compared to Victoria\u2019s Secret.\nWhile her entrepreneurism is impressive, Rihanna\u2019s star power is also part of the package here. She has 67.9m followers on Instagram, where she regularly shares images of herself in outfits including a ruffle cocktail dress or a snakeskin dress and matching bucket hat. The direct connection with her fans saw her crowned \u201cMost marketable celebrity\u201d in 2016. The NPD Group, who conducted the research, judged that Rihanna\u2019s followers would be 3.7 times more likely to buy something seen on her account than that of other celebrities.\nLVMH are working on a new brand with French designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, too. This is likely to pique fashion insiders\u2019 interests. Ghesqui\u00e8re is also creative director of Louis Vuitton. Like Project Loud France, the date of this launch is unknown.",

        "content": "Hassan Rouhani has so far neither accepted or rejected Javad Zarif\u2019s resignation from the Iranian government\nThe Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is under pressure to reject the resignation of the foreign minister Javad Zarif, who had announced his departure on Monday with a condemnation of what he described as the \u201cdeadly poison\u201d of infighting among Iran\u2019s parties and factions.\nNews of the veteran diplomat\u2019s resignation, which he broke in an Instagram post on Monday night, had prompted a fall in the Iranian stock exchange and a rearguard action by reformists, who had called on Rouhani, to refuse to accept it.\nRouhani\u2019s chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, had earlier tweeted to strongly deny reports that Zarif\u2019s resignation had been accepted by the president. He added later on Instagram: \u201cIn the view of Dr Rouhani, the Islamic Republic of Iran has only one foreign policy and one foreign minister.\u201d\nA Instagram post from Rouhani\u2019s supporters with the hashtag #Zarif-is-staying was however wrongly cited in reports as coming from the president himself. Rouhani has neither accepted or rejected his moderate ally\u2019s resignation.\nZarif\u2019s surprise move came as the landmark nuclear deal he negotiated with world powers stands on the verge of collapse after the withdrawal of the US.\nIn an interview on Tuesday, published by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, Zarif said infighting was a barrier to formulating foreign policy, suggesting he may have resigned over pressure from hardline elements opposed to his role in negotiating the 2015 agreement.\n\u201cWe first have to remove our foreign policy from the issue of party and factional fighting,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cThe deadly poison for foreign policy is for foreign policy to become an issue of party and factional fighting.\u201d\nA majority of Iranian parliamentarians signed a petition calling for him to stay in office, according to a spokesman for parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy commission.\nThere were also reports that Iranian diplomats internationally were threatening to resign in solidarity with Zarif and provoke a wider foreign policy crisis. In a statement, Zarif urged other diplomats not to follow his course of action, saying the aim of his resignation was to strengthen his department.\nIn his resignation note, Zarif apologised for his \u201cshortcomings\u201d and \u201cinability to continue serving\u201d.\nThere were informed reports that he was angry at being excluded from a meeting between the Iranian leadership and Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian president made a rare visit to Tehran on Monday.\nThe future of Syria is critical to Iranian foreign policy, and Zarif\u2019s exclusion from a meeting between Rouhani and Assad was taken as a snub that undermined the prestige and efficiency of the foreign ministry. It is said to be one of a series of clashes between the office of the president and the foreign ministry.\nOn Sunday, Zarif had criticised Iranian hardliners in a speech in Tehran, saying: \u201cWe cannot hide behind imperialism\u2019s plot and blame them for our own incapability. Independence does not mean isolation from the world.\u201d\nZarif\u2019s resignation leaves Rouhani without one of his main allies in pushing the Iran towards more negotiation with the west. Analysts have said Rouhani faces growing political pressure from hardliners in the government as the unravelling nuclear deal further strains the economy.\nZarif, who is fluent in English, is seen as the acceptable face of Iranian diplomacy to the west, which has made him the subject of relentless attack by hardliners, especially over his role in championing the nuclear deal.\nDonald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement last year, leaving Europe to make limited efforts to prevent powerful US sanctions from destroying Iranian hopes of increasing trade with the west \u2013 the supposed benefit of the deal from the Iranian standpoint.\nEuropean diplomats were aghast at Zarif\u2019s resignation, potentially losing their chief interlocutor, and angrily condemning the US for pushing him over the edge. One diplomat likened the US administration\u2019s attitude to Marxist revolutionaries worshipping at the altar of change and disruption.\nThe EU has long warned sanctions that cripple the Iranian economy will only weaken reformists in Tehran, and not usher in the kind of democratic revolution that the Trump team seem to be seeking to engineer.\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tweeted his reaction to Zarif\u2019s announcement.\nWe note @JZarif\u2019s resignation. We\u2019ll see if it sticks. Either way, he and @HassanRouhani are just front men for a corrupt religious mafia. We know @khamenei_ir makes all final decisions. Our policy is unchanged\u2014the regime must behave like a normal country and respect its people.\nA US state department official tweeted an unflattering gif of Zarif, saying: \u201cHow do you know @JZarif is lying? His lips are moving.\u201d\nZarif served as Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UN from 2002 to 2007, first under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and then under the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nLater, secret talks between the US and Iran in Oman became fully fledged negotiations over its nuclear programme. During the talks, Zarif met the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, more than 50 times \u2013 something unimaginable years earlier.",

Last week the General Synod passed new legislation that will make it possible for \u201cconnected\u201d parishes that are not in a \u201cunited parish\u201d to establish a single joint council with a single bank account and charitable status, replacing the requirement for multiple parochial church councils.\nFinally, the existing rules on electoral rolls allow for situations where parishioners travel to services within a group of churches. In such cases they may be counted on the electoral roll of the parish that they attend at least once a month.\nWe are continuing to review church legislation and welcome proposals that support the simplification strand, and the other strands, of the Church of England\u2019s Renewal and Reform programme.William NyeSecretary general, Archbishops\u2019 Council of the Church of England\n The Church in Wales Review of 2012 began a process of creating ministry/mission areas, allowing for the kind of flexibility Ivan Ball describes. It is, however, essential that parishes recognise the shortcomings of the present system and are prepared to embrace change. In some parts of Wales (including my former diocese of St Asaph) the change extends beyond the model of \u201cone benefice, one priest\u201d.

Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDecisions on the proscription of organisations as terror groups are supposed to be made on the advice of civil servants based on clear evidence that those organisations fall foul of the proscription criteria set out in legislation.\n\u201cThe home secretary must therefore now demonstrate that this decision was taken in an objective and impartial way, and driven by clear and new evidence, not by his leadership ambitions.\u201d\nHezbollah \u2013 or the Party of God \u2013 is a Shia Muslim movement which emerged during the early 1980s with financial backing from Iran. Its political wing is already proscribed by the US state department, but not by the EU. From Friday, membership will be a criminal offence, carrying a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in the UK.\nLabour backed the barring of the other groups, active in Mali and Burkino Faso respectively, the spokesman added. With Labour MPs not objecting, there is unlikely to be a vote on the changes.\nAsked about the Labour view, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously for the opposition to explain why they have taken that decision.\n\u201cIn light of Hezbollah\u2019s increasingly destabilising behaviour over recent years we believe it is right to proscribe the entire organisation. Hezbollah itself has publicly denied a distinction between its military and political wings.\n\u201cThe group in its entirety is assessed to be concerned in terrorism. The links between the senior leaders of Hezbollah\u2019s political and military wings, as well as the group\u2019s destabilising role in the region mean that the distinction between the two wings is now untenable.\u201d",

But the court displays little knowledge of the situation today. All but Diego Garcia and just one of the larger islands (30 out of 50) are infested with rats and uninhabitable. Billions would be required to restore them to a condition able to support significant populations.\nA poor country like Mauritius could never afford even a fraction of the cost. The ecological danger to the planet is that Mauritius would flog off Chagos\u2019s fishing rights to Japanese and other commercial operators, as it did with its own rights.\nThe current 200-mile exclusion zone provides a unique ocean laboratory where all manner of marine life thrives and can be studied. Much has been destroyed by man everywhere else. Whatever the outcome, it must be retained, maintained and protected. Jonathan HuntLondon\n China was furious when the judgment of the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague ruled in July 2016 against its claims to huge areas of the South China Sea where on various uninhabited reefs, shoals and rocks it had already set up military infrastructure.\nIts ambitions are highly controversial, but it hasn\u2019t turfed anyone from their home. The sensitivity of the region didn\u2019t, however, deter the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, from vowing to send the new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the area in his speech on \u201cdefence in Global Britain\u201d earlier this month.\nBetween 1967 and 1973 the UK expelled the Chagos islanders from their Indian Ocean home so that the largest island could be used as a strategic military base. Now that the international court of justice has ruled that the UK should end its wrongful administration, one wonders whether China will feel it should deploy its carrier Liaoning in the region in order to \u201cuse its global capabilities to strengthen its global presence\u201d, to borrow Williamson\u2019s phrase.Paul TattamChinley, Derbyshire \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Polly Toynbee says that Labour\u2019s mission must be to prevent any Brexit (Journal, 26 February). This is not the right message to convey. Meanwhile, I heard a Labour MP say that Jeremy Corbyn, in coming to support a public vote, is failing to respect manifesto promises. This is as far from the truth as Toynbee\u2019s view of Labour\u2019s mission.\nLabour\u2019s manifesto actually said that the party would \u201cbuild a close new relationship with the EU, protect workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, provide certainty to EU nationals and give a meaningful role to parliament throughout negotiations\u201d. Two things follow from this: 1) Labour MPs should stand firmly opposed to May\u2019s deal, and, of course, to a no-deal exit; 2) parliament must now play a role in preventing the prime minister from defying parliament.\nFor Labour supporters, the case for a new public vote does not rest on the party having a mission to prevent any Brexit, as if it were a party of remoaners who might stand accused of \u201cbetraying the people\u201d. The case must be that such a vote coheres with the manifesto, is demanded by the policy decision of the 2018 party conference, and can be a route out of the place that an autocratic Tory prime minister, determined to appease the far right in her party, has striven to take the country.\nThe case for a public vote is harder than it should be to make. Thanks to rhetoric that has taken hold, many have succumbed to the myth of the mandate that must be obeyed. This leads many to think that the referendum result must be enacted no matter how damaging the consequences of the government\u2019s implementation of it, no matter how the facts have changed, and no matter how opinions may have changed. The shame is that there is now so little time for Labour to dislodge the myth.Jennifer HornsbyLondon\n Aditya Chakrabortty should not have based his argument for Labour to support a people\u2019s vote on the often-quoted TSSA poll of Labour leave voters (If Labour aids this Tory plot it will be crushed by what follows, 25 February). The relevant statistics are not the greater number of pro-remain over pro-Brexit Labour voters. The more relevant data concerns the numbers of leave voters in the 20 Labour-held marginals most vulnerable to the Tories \u2013 16 of these constituencies voted for leave. Almost as relevant are the 45 Tory-held Labour target seats. More than two-thirds \u2013 37 \u2013 of these had leave majorities.\nIf Labour does not win a majority in both these types of marginal, they will not win a general election in which Brexit is a major issue. Holding on to its predominantly remain-voting constituencies will not give Labour the 64 extra seats necessary to get the majority to form a government. Irrespective of whether a new referendum could reverse the result of 2016, Labour would most probably lose a subsequent general election.Bryn JonesUniversity of Bath\n It seems Jeremy Corbyn can\u2019t win. Now that he has finally \u201cthrown his party\u2019s weight behind a second EU referendum\u201d in the inevitable eventuality of Labour failing to get \u201cits own version of a Brexit deal\u201d passed this week, the criticism keeps on coming (Corbyn: we\u2019ll back a public vote to stop Tory Brexit, 26 February). Despite the decision being eminently sensible, both politically and electorally, showing up the rebel Independent Group for their over-hasty defection, and the feebleness of parliament being exposed by divisions and indecision, Corbyn\u2019s move is seen as being \u201cdivisive\u201d, having a \u201ccorrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament\u201d. Over the last few weeks his refusal to support the idea of another vote was seen as being anti-democratic, presumably eroding the \u201csovereignty of democracy\u201d.\nThe fact that Corbyn is prepared to allow the voters a final say shows his determination to avoid a disastrous no-deal exit, and deserves support and praise from all Labour MPs. If some are still reluctant to acknowledge sensible leadership, it makes one wonder whether they would vote in parliament to end austerity, increase taxes on the rich, and support all the other excellent policies proposed in the last Labour manifesto. After all, isn\u2019t it the \u201csovereignty of the people\u201d that really counts?Bernie EvansPerth, Western Australia\n It was Richmond (Yorks) Labour party what did it. On 13 February it called on our party leadership and MPs to urgently follow up the Brexit resolution passed overwhelmingly at conference, which included \u201ccampaigning for a public vote\u201d.Barbara HawkinsGreat Ayton, North Yorkshire\n I am afraid this is no more than another tactic by the arch-Brexiter Corbyn to keep his ramshackle show on the road. He knows there is no parliamentary majority for this and so has not even bothered to try to articulate what he means by a public vote. And how does Kyle/Wilson solve anything? If May\u2019s deal is voted through it will not be possible to hold another referendum before we leave the EU on 29 March. So even if the second referendum reverses the result of the first, it will simply leave the UK needing to apply to rejoin.\nNo, the only sensible course is for the majority of MPs who are in favour of remaining to table a bill mandating the government to write to the EU, reversing the article 50 letter. The people\u2019s will will be overridden, but in this case the vote to leave was the same as a vote for every household to have a government-funded Rolls-Royce and champagne and caviar for breakfast every day \u2013 it is simply not something the country can afford to do and it is for responsible MPs to act accordingly and vote to protect the national interest.Raj ParkashLondon\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

One said the enforced secrecy forged closer ties: \u201cIf you\u2019re not allowed to talk to your friends or family about your job, that\u2019s going to create some distance. You might feel closer to these people. It feels like an emotional connection, when in reality you\u2019re just trauma bonding.\u201d\nOther employees said colleagues had come to believe the conspiracy theories they were supposed to be flagging. A former employee told the Verge: \u201cI no longer believe 9/11 was a terrorist attack\u201d; another reportedly promotes the idea that Earth is flat, while a third \u201chas begun to question certain aspects of the Holocaust\u201d, the website reports.\nStaff are allowed two nine-minute \u201cwellness breaks\u201d each day if they need to walk away from the work.

They have experience managing large workforces; scaling quickly for new issues and risks; and adapting with us as the risks to our community and product needs change over time.\u201d\nOsofsky said the company encouraged \u201cpartner employees\u201d \u2013 those workers employed by third-party contractors \u2013 to raise concerns with their employers\u2019 HR teams or to call a dedicated whistleblower hotline that the company had set up for this purpose.\n\u201cPut simply, after a couple of years of very rapid growth, we\u2019re now further upgrading our work in this area to continue to operate effectively and improve at this size,\u201d he said.",

With the Paris launch of the new messages, taken from the titles of American feminist Robin Morgan\u2019s book trilogy, next season is no different.\nFinding her inspiration from the subculture of Teddy girls in 1950s London, Chiuri said she was drawn to them for the rebellion they represented and wanted to shine a light on the opposing end of the social spectrum of decade that Christian Dior created the era-defining \u201cNew Look\u201d beloved by high society.\n\u201cWhen I was young, I \u2013 as well as many other designers \u2013 was fascinated with London. We all wanted to go there because it had tradition but it was also open to breaking the rules,\u201d she explained before the show. That summary encapsulates her approach to designing this collection, in which she wanted to use the codes of the house but personalise them for the first time. Accordingly, she blended the honed skill of the atelier with a cool wearability demanded by ready-to-wear clothes.\nFresh interpretations of the famous bar jacket were cut from technical taffeta and cotton, rather than the stiff and heavy wools of their original 1950s counterparts \u201cto make it more contemporary\u201d, she said. They were given velvet lapels and worn with tailored trousers with a dropped crotch and cropped to shin length, as preferred by the Teds. Elsewhere, fine-knit wool came in buttoned-up collared tops, tartan and Vichy check dominated, and shoes were a medley of monk-strap brogues, pointed loafers and ankle boots worn with socks.\nThe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of the current V&A exhibition, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, is the dress Dior designed for Princess Margaret\u2019s 21st birthday in 1951 (showing Dior\u2019s own high regard for Britain) and the Cecil Beaton photograph of the royal was also on Chiuri\u2019s mood board. It accounted for the more classic nipped-in waists and diaphanous A-line lengths of embellished tulle, albeit worn with a new interpretation of the corset in the form of an elasticated leather belt.\nAs well as Morgan, Chiuri used the occasion to celebrate several other female creatives, including artist and fellow Italian Tomaso Binga, who designed the show set, which was covered in a giant A to Z made from nude bodies, based on her work Alfabeto from 1970.\nThe future is something that the fashion industry, as a whole, is pensive about right now, especially following Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s death last week. Much like her objective to honour the past while looking to the future, Chiuri dedicated the show to the Chanel designer, but acknowledged life moves on. \u201cI was very sad because Karl passed away, but at the same time it\u2019s a sign. He was a creative director for another era. In the future, it will be impossible for a creative director to arrive at a house and stay for 50 years, like he did at Fendi.\u201d\nFor how many years Chiuri herself will hold the reins at Dior is, of course, unknown, but for now she is busy building a legacy reflective of her own era. \u201cThis is a new chapter,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cA new code.\u201d",

I was curious to find out how the sound of a bassoon would fit in to an indie-rock band. Mark had written short \u2018sequences\u2019 of music that he planned to insert between tracks to link the whole album together, or to use as a backing for parts of the tracks. He knew exactly the sounds he wanted, so we recorded different versions of each section to make it sound happy, angry, lost \u2026 And even though we went over some parts at length, there was a lovely, friendly atmosphere in the room.\nHe wanted one track to sound tentative, so we imagined we were drops of water that had waited thousands of years until, at last, we were to fall from a stalactite. Unusual strategy! When I heard the resulting album, I loved the result. He had a unique gift for blending different sounds to create an entirely new effect, and it all flowed together seamlessly. It is a great pity that he didn\u2019t compose many more albums. I am shocked to hear of his death. He was a unique musician with a gentle manner and a wonderful musical imagination.\nHayden Thorpe\n When I first heard Spirit of Eden, I thought the CD had melted into the stereo. I don\u2019t know anyone else who I can look to as a master of pop craft as well as an experimental pioneer. It was his voice that led me: he found hooks in places I\u2019m still trying to fathom.\nPeter Gabriel\n Real originality is a rare commodity in music. Mark created very personal pictures with his music and magical voice, a wry, unique and soulful take on the world. He will be missed.\nWendy Smith, Prefab Sprout\n I remember when I listened to I Believe in You, from Spirit of Eden, for the entire three hours and 15 minutes of a train journey from London to Newcastle, its melancholy reflecting my mood. A barely audible piano. The quiet cymbals and drums that sounded as if they were recorded in someone\u2019s living room. Soft, muted and persistent bass. The Hammond organ drone, more church than jazz. The voice of Mark Hollis, a murmuration. Blurred words, as exquisite as any of Liz Fraser\u2019s incantations with the Cocteau Twins. And then the choir, the word \u201cspirit\u201d floating above everything.\nThe track embodies everything I love about music: the creation of atmosphere through sound and silence; its acting as a mirror and container for experience, ideas, mixed feelings and complexity. The music of Mark Hollis is not about show. It\u2019s about listening. There\u2019s a classical influence: Debussy, Ravel, maybe even John Cage. He was an enigmatic, elusive singer-songwriter who once said: \u201cI would rather hear silence than I would one note.\u201d Let\u2019s not say he \u201cretired\u201d from music: he pursued other things in life. Sometimes, it\u2019s the beauty of what you can\u2019t hear that makes a sound.\nAlexis Taylor, Hot Chip\n Mark made some of my favourite records, with Talk Talk (Laughing Stock in particular) and as a solo artist. His use of space, melody and timbral interest was unique. I have spent many hours over many years listening to these records, with great wonder at the special atmosphere he helped create. Mark once wrote me a kind and thoughtful letter when I contacted him asking for help with some music I was working on. He will live on in his wonderful recorded music and spirit of experimentation.\nRoland Orzabal, Tears for Fears\n He was a god among so many mere mortals of 80s music. In fact, to brand what he did with Talk Talk as \u201c\u201880s music\u201d is to discredit the genius that seeped out of his melodies and lyrics \u2013 lyrics that sometimes barely made it out of his mouth, as though he wanted to keep the world\u2019s best kept secret all to himself.\nCharlotte ChurchSpirit of Eden is, hands down, one of the greatest records ever made. The amount of healing that record allows is nothing less than a beautiful gift and I am ever thankful for it. Thank you, Mark, for your enigmatic spirit, which surrounded and comforted us through every work you made.\nKarl Hyde, Underworld\n In 1988, Rick [Smith] and I were on tour in Australia with the first incarnation of Underworld. We were writing our soon-to-fail second album, striving to do something great, when we received Spirit of Eden on cassette in the post from our manager with a note saying: \u201cIf you want to know what brave is, this is it.\u201d We listened to it on the stereo of a rented car as we drove from Sydney to Brisbane, neither of us able to say a word because we knew the bar had been set higher than we would ever be able to reach. That album still travels with me everywhere as a reminder of what brave is. Mark Hollis \u2013 what a tragic loss.\nMary Epworth\n It\u2019s strangely appropriate that Mark has slipped away while the strangest and sunniest February spring is bursting into life. There\u2019s nature and landscape all through his work, and such a sense of space and emotion. I sometimes find it so overwhelmingly intense that I\u2019m not robust enough to listen to it. Right now, I\u2019m in a park, surrounded by new white sloe blossom, listening to Eden and trying not to let anyone see the faces I\u2019m pulling.\nRyley Walker\n Mark Hollis wrote the playbook for so much of the music that I hold close to my heart. His music has the widest vision and somehow so much isolation: this sort of far-out, Technicolor world with a broken spirit that always gets back up. When I toured with the world\u2019s best storyteller, Danny Thompson [who played on The Colour of Spring and Spirit of Eden], I would ask him about Mark, expecting larger-than-life tales. All Danny said about him was that he was a \u201cmarvellous soul, loved his morning tea\u201d. Turning young record-heads on to Talk Talk and hearing reports back about their brain being shifted is such a thrill. I live for those conversations that begin with: \u201cWait, you haven\u2019t heard Laughing Stock?\u201d A massive loss, to say the least.\nRachel Goswell, Slowdive\n My earliest memory of Talk Talk was hearing Life\u2019s What You Make It on the radio and instantly falling in love. It has one of the best hooks I\u2019ve ever heard and stands up for me as one of the best songs ever written. It always brings me joy when I hear it.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 1994 that I discovered Talk Talk properly. When we started the very difficult process of recording our third album, Pygmalion, Neil [Halstead] was absorbed in Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. Naturally, this led to me listening to those records, and their influence can be heard throughout Pygmalion.\nWith music, it is often the voice that my ears tend to absorb most. Mark\u2019s voice has such fragile beauty and warmth. Eden floors me every time I hear it \u2013 lyrically it\u2019s so beautiful, and the space and depth of the songs are simply wonderful. In my earlier years, I would have spent my time listening to these songs with headphones on and no doubt had a joint in hand. I still go back to these records time and time again \u2013 sans drugs \u2013 and let them wrap around me like a familiar friend. These records stir a myriad of emotions and give me comfort and peace. I am so sad to hear of Mark\u2019s passing. He was a genius.\nJulia Biel\n I was introduced to the masterpiece that is Spirit of Eden as a student. I had it on repeat for months. It still illuminates the darkest of times for me and gives comfort where all else fails. Every sound is considered and meaningful and unashamedly emotional and raw. It showed me how powerful music could be, and awoke in me the urge to make music myself. Mark Hollis broke the mould gloriously and left us his truth in music \u2013 the honesty of it will forever be a tonic in my world.\nRichard Reed Parry, Arcade Fire\n If there were ever records that defy description, it\u2019s Spirit of Eden, Laughing Stock, and Mark\u2019s solo record. I don\u2019t know of any other albums as confidently soft-spoken and utterly without precedent \u2013 where the sound of the room seems to be as important as any instrument, where the quality of an improvised single note, captured on tape the first time it\u2019s played, is far more important than any amount of rehearsing or catchy pop melody. This trinity of modern chamber, jazz, post-rock masterpieces are some of the most finely crafted albums ever made, with no discernible limits to their scope beyond their own gorgeous sense of self-restraint.\nI feel so thankful that any band could incorporate such vast amounts of space and silence into their albums: they really created a precedent for artful quietude. And then Mark went and set the quiet bar even higher with his solo album, a gloriously delicate and naturalistic piece of work that I struggle to find words for. I realise as I write that it\u2019s entirely unnecessary, and in fact all I want to say is, thank you for this music and the exquisite silences and spaces within it. They touched me and influenced and inspired me more than I will ever be able to quantify.\nJack Barnett, These New Puritans\n Mark stretched the boundaries of what could be called popular music. He wrote some of the best pop songs ever written, and made some of the best albums ever recorded. In a backslapping musical world of insipid dilettantes, Mark and his music stand for absolute conviction, absolute meaning and the absolute refusal to compromise your vision. We\u2019ve recorded a fair amount with Phill Brown, who engineered the later Talk Talk albums, and he told us so many inspiring and hilarious stories \u2013 a treasure trove of ways to disorient the received wisdom about how to make music \u2013 from which it sounds like Mark was a wonderful human being, too.\nFelix White, the Maccabees\n My fleeting impression of Talk Talk was that they were a slightly cheesy synth 80s band that sounded a bit like Duran Duran. That was kind of true. But Mark\u2019s subsequently substantial impact on my life came as an introduction to the band\u2019s later work. After our first two records, my band were making an album that sounded like nothing we\u2019d done before, and to our record label, worryingly unpalatable. We were looking for historical reassurance that we might be able to continue while not exploding our lives in one gesture. Our manager told me to listen first to Colour of Spring, then Spirit of Eden. If Colour of Spring was a small lightning bulb, Spirit of Eden turned my head inside-out. Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t live without it. I couldn\u2019t believe I had lived and made music for so long without it.\nOnce you fall in love with an album, it\u2019s a delicate job to convince someone else to come to the same conclusion. You can be so drunk with your own connection to it that it can be extremely off-putting. There was a danger of that with me and Spirit of Eden. We\u2019d come home from parties and I\u2019d make everyone stop whatever they were doing and lie on the floor to listen to it in its entirety. If anyone moved, I\u2019d bolt upright to shush them. The thing was, it worked.\nAfter I had played his solo record [on repeat] as well, I watched the Live at Montreux video from 1986. The genius was in that 80s synth-pop band with mullets and vests and bongos. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more charming than Mark at the start of Talk Talk\u2019s Such a Shame video mouthing to the camera: \u201cHow you doing, you alriggghht?!\u201d before the song starts. As serious as his music would become, it felt like he was telling you: \u201cYeah, being in a band is really stupid, but it\u2019s really fun.\u201d That was just as powerful, really.\nRichard King, author\n The Talk Talk song New Grass appears on Laughing Stock, the final record credited to the group, and shares its title with an album by Albert Ayler. Laughing Stock was released on Verve, a company that had, in part, appealed to Mark and his remaining bandmates due to the label\u2019s association with jazz.\nFrom the group\u2019s inception, Hollis had experimented with song length and structure, but the final trilogy of studio recordings \u2013 The Colour of Spring, Laughing Stock and Mark Hollis \u2013 confirmed that these experiments were borne of an intensity and fearlessness that was equivalent to those of the jazz recordings he held in esteem. The very British, indeed very English emotional space he created in these three albums proved highly influential: the stadium ennui of Radiohead and Coldplay owes a substantial debt to Spirit of Eden\u2019s I Believe in You; the Talk Talk soundworld of diffuse instruments and seemingly random microphone placements first became a signature of post-rock, then familiar as a contemporary production technique.\nDespite his innovations, he frequently sounded frustrated at having reached the limit of both the studio and his own ability. As a counterpoint, he regularly included passages of silence in his compositions. Today, these moments have an added poignancy. They prefigure his retreat from music and now, his death. He leaves a body of work entirely unique in its musical and emotional range: the revelatory sound of a private, British spirituality.\nPeter Brewis, Field Music\n We didn\u2019t really know about Talk Talk or Mark Hollis until after he\u2019d stopped releasing music. But through the bands we loved in at the turn of the millennium, we started to find out about the profound influence those last four albums had had on musicians searching for something new, and something of their own. Mark Hollis was an essential part of that long line of music makers \u2013 Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Robert Wyatt, Can \u2013 who seemed to thrive on that search and in the process blurred the boundaries between pop, rock, jazz and classical. To us, his experiment seemed to be one of dynamics and form rather than timbre or technology \u2013 seeing what new things can be done with traditional instruments \u2013 and not in a flashy way, but quietly to the point of secrecy. And maybe it is that which still demands our attention. It was brave and that was hugely important to us.\nSteven WilsonIt\u2019s hard to think of any pop musician to whom the word \u201cintegrity\u201d would apply more than it does Mark. Perhaps Kate Bush. I still think of Spirit of Eden as the most admirable fuck-you to commerciality and the pop mainstream ever made \u2013 and, of course, it\u2019s a much better record than the previous holder of that award, Metal Machine Music. And I loved Mark for it. And on Laughing Stock, the minute-long, one-note noise guitar solo in the otherwise transcendently beautiful After the Flood is one of my favourite Mark moments, showcasing the musical prankster in him. His records still stand for me as the most beautiful pop music ever made, albums where every musical gesture seems somehow sacred. Listening to them changes you for ever.\nShara Worden, My Brightest Diamond\n The day I met drummer Earl Harvin for the first time, we rehearsed some songs and then he made pasta and played me records. It was the first of many listening parties in which we aligned our musical values. Earl played Mark Hollis\u2019 solo record that night and I was shocked by the silence and musical space in the arrangements. The recording quality was rich and warm. We sat listening without talking. That first listening session has defined the last 20 years of our musical relationship as My Brightest Diamond. Mark\u2019s voice, his aesthetic, his care for detail and his songs have been core for us: deeply resonant music to which we continually return.\nMax Richter\n Mark Hollis\u2019s death robs us of a visionary talent. When we heard the news, the film mix I\u2019m working on ground to a halt, and we played Spirit of Eden instead. It\u2019s one of a tiny handful of records that I\u2019ve played regularly for decades. The first time I heard it, I felt like I\u2019d found a secret universe, one that contained something I\u2019d been been missing without my being aware of it, and that seemed to promise a way of making sense of the world. I read somewhere that a person\u2019s true legacy is what they leave behind in the hearts of others. By that measure, Mark Hollis left us a very beautiful legacy indeed.",

Why don\u2019t they just go to the pub?\nTake a look at the picture of the Independent Group dining in Nando\u2019s, then figure out how many messages it took for them to choose Nando\u2019s. How many alternatives had been rejected first? Carluccio\u2019s? Sells cappuccino, too fancy. KFC? Obesity lobby would have a field day. Itsu? Too foreign. Almost everywhere? Too expensive; remember all those food banks we\u2019ve walked around, smiling. McDonald\u2019s? No, that would look like an obscure pisstake in a way that only Angela Smith wouldn\u2019t understand.\nEating out has always been vexed territory for politicians. If you take \u201cknowing the price of milk\u201d as the indicator of being in touch with the pressures on the average Joe and \u201cdrinks frothy coffee\u201d as the sign of being a member of the liberal metropolitan elite, turn all that dairy into solid food and you\u2019re in the eye of the storm.\nPoliticians tie themselves in knots trying to eat the most normal food imaginable to prove they are somehow of the people. The Conservatives plot about Brexit over pizzas; Alistair Darling as chancellor is said to have saved the international banking system over curry; everyone, everywhere pretends to eat pasties, coming unstuck like David Cameron as they fake-remember a hot meat pastry from a station kiosk that had long closed. Sausage rolls take on a near-unique primacy, as reactionaries especially stand guard over their quiddity: they must not be vegan; truthfully, they don\u2019t count unless they contain some spinal cord.\nThe easiest thing would be never to eat, since, like an imaginary loyalty to a football team, it\u2019s hard to get caught out if you never mention it. However, item one on any political-identity to-do list is to look like a human being. Arguably, Ed Miliband was in fact bolstered by his bacon sandwich, since, whatever the antisemitic undertones of the tabloid obsession with that photograph, it did him a power of good to look like a normal person who was sometimes hungry (unlike, say, a nerd who only thought about numbers).\nThe portrait in Nando\u2019s had the opposite effect: stagey and awkward, it merely served to underline how bizarre it would be to chance upon any of them (except maybe Mike Gapes) in a chicken outlet. It recalled, too, the recent Conservative attempts to woo the younger voter with vouchers, swiftly disavowed by Nando\u2019s, which may be why the breakaway group chose it in the first place. My advice? Go back in time, meet in a pub. Nobody looks out of place in a pub; Mini Cheddars bridge all divides.",

Prosecutors have blamed the attack on officials of the Iranian government, which has denied involvement and refused to turn over suspects.\nArgentina\u2019s Jewish community \u2013 the fourth largest outside Israel and the United States \u2013 has good reason to be alarmed: successive Argentinian governments failed to resolve the AMIA bombing, and a number of former government officials \u2013 including former president Carlos Menem, a former judge and two former prosecutors are set to be sentenced on Thursday after being convicted of covering up leads and otherwise thwarting the investigation.\nAlberto Nisman, the special prosecutor who investigated the AMIA bombing after the original trial failed to produce results, was found dead from a gunshot wound in his bathroom in January 2015. Days earlier he had accused former president Cristina Kirchner of conspiring with Iran to deflect an investigation into the bombing.\nNisman\u2019s allegations against Fern\u00e1ndez remain unsubstantiated and his death remains equally unexplained, leaving it unclear whether he took his own life or fell victim to a political revenge killing.\nDavidovich was in a hospital on Tuesday with several broken ribs and a punctured lung. The assailants also took money and some belongings, according to the AMIA.\nMauricio Macri sent a tweet repudiating the attack and vowing aid to find the attackers.

The R&B star, whose alleged sexual predation was recently examined in the Lifetime docu-series Surviving R Kelly, was arrested last week on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse against four victims, including three minors.\n\u201cR Kelly\u2019s best bet right now is to pray,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know if God has time for his prayers, because he\u2019s got his hands full right now,\u201d he added in reference to Pope Francis\u2019s summit on sexual abuse within the Catholic church.\nDuring the summit, Pope Francis warned that abusers within the church would face the full \u201cwrath of God\u201d, also known as \u201cthe ultimate \u2018Just wait until Dad gets home\u2019\u201d, according to Noah.\nThat sentence is serious \u2026 or not. \u201cMany people are pointing out that the wrath of God isn\u2019t a thing,\u201d Noah observed. \u201cYeah, I bet R Kelly heard this and he was like, \u2018Can I also take the wrath of God as my punishment?\u2019\u201d\nIn still other sex scandal news, one of Trump\u2019s cabinet members, Alexander Acosta, is drawing closer scrutiny for his extremely light plea deal with the Florida billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who stood accused a decade ago of sex crimes with girls as young as 14.\n\u201cYes, you heard that right,\u201d Noah paused. \u201cEleven years ago, the man who is now Trump\u2019s labor secretary basically let a billionaire off the hook for abusing underage girls.\u201d President Trump\u2019s response? \u201cThat seems like a long time ago.\u201d\n\u201cThink about how crazy this is: there\u2019s a member of Trump\u2019s cabinet who helped a billionaire sex offender sweep a scandal under the rug,\u201d Noah said, incredulous. Yet there\u2019s another billionaire sex scandal stealing the headlines this week: Patriots owner Robert Kraft has been charged with soliciting prostitution as part of a sex trafficking sting in Florida.\nJokes of happy endings aside, Noah noted that the Kraft scandal wasn\u2019t merely a rich man paying for sex; investigators claim that the women involved weren\u2019t willing sex workers, and were forced to serve more than a thousand clients a year. \u201cSo this wasn\u2019t Pretty Woman. It\u2019s more like pretty horrific, which is why these are very serious charges \u2013 unless you\u2019re a Patriots fan,\u201d said Noah before clips of several diehard Patriots fans standing by their owner.\nThe unwavering support for Kraft only demonstrated \u201cwhat\u2019s incredible about sports in America \u2013 if you\u2019re winning, there\u2019s no limit to what your fans will let you get away with,\u201d Noah said.\nThat being said, \u201cyou can call it insensitive for these people to just brush aside serious sex crimes like this, but you could also call it \u2018presidential\u2019.\u201d\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at Trump\u2019s constant need for attention. Trump seemed particularly inflamed that the Oscars, held on Sunday night in Los Angeles, didn\u2019t even mention him; the closest anyone strayed to a presidential reference was Spike Lee\u2019s exhortation that Americans \u201cdo the right thing\u201d in the 2020 election. After the show, Trump tweeted disparagingly at Lee, who won his first Oscar for co-writing the screenplay for BlacKkKlansman.\n\u201cI love that he didn\u2019t mention Trump by name but Trump heard \u2018hate\u2019 and assumed it was about him,\u201d Meyers said.\nIn other news, CNN reported over the weekend that Trump is looking forward to sowing chaos and division among Democrats in the primaries, though those are still a year away. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tagline for a new sitcom \u2013 \u2018he\u2019s bad at government but great at causing chaos. Tune in this fall for The President is a Cat,\u201d Meyers mused.\nTrump\u2019s nomination over the weekend of Kelly Craft as ambassador to the United Nations probably falls into the \u201ccausing chaos\u201d category. Craft, a prominent GOP donor and climate change skeptic, said in a 2017 interview that she believed \u201cthere are sciences on both sides that are accurate \u2026 I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science [on climate change].\u201d\n\u201cShe sounds like a sixth-grader who forgot to do a project for the science fair,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cAlso, there are not both sides. There\u2019s one side with all the world\u2019s scientists on it and then there\u2019s the other side, which is just Donald Trump.\u201d\nOver in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the hostless Oscars. \u201cThe theme for the Oscars this year was the Grammys,\u201d he said in reference to the show\u2019s numerous musical performances, including Adam Lambert and Queen, Bette Midler and a sensual reprise of A Star Is Born\u2019s breakout song, Shallow.\n\u201cLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper had so much sexual chemistry that about a minute into the song, my wife started ovulating,\u201d Kimmel joked.\nSunday\u2019s Oscars were also \u201ca historic night for diversity\u201d \u2013 Black Panther won three Oscars, while Roma won three Oscars, including for best director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.\nSpike Lee won his first Oscar, and then got a shout-out from the president, who tweeted that it would \u201cbe nice if Spike Lee could read his notes\u201d and praised himself for doing more for African Americans than \u201calmost any other Pres!\u201d\n\u201cI like that \u2018almost any other Pres\u2019,\u201d Kimmel laughed before sarcastically adding, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that damn Lincoln, I\u2019d be number one!\u201d",

A young humpback whale lies flat out in a forest clearing made by its own bulk. If it had sunk in the sea, this whale would be food for hagfish and cookiecutter sharks. Instead its yellowed, sagging blubber has been pecked at by birds. What baffling force could have thrown this giant ocean mammal into the Amazon rainforest?\nIt\u2019s the kind of prodigious sight that previous ages would have interpreted as an omen \u2013 and we still can\u2019t resist seeing it that way. The sheer out-of-placeness of this poor juvenile stranded in death without the sea in sight is even more disconcerting than a pod of whales washed up on a beach or a lone cetacean in the Thames. It shows how the medieval cosmology of the four elements lodges in our imaginations: how has a creature of the water ended up on the earth? Or to put it in the more contemporary language of conspiracy theories: this dead sea mammal is very fishy. Perhaps it was taken by aliens to be probed, then dumped here. Maybe it was airlifted by the deep state for reasons of its own.\nMore reasonably, this image distils our knowledge that human actions have changed the climate, polluted the oceans and ransacked the rainforest. A whale in the Amazon rainforest conjoins two natural wonders that humanity threatens, two immense habitats we risk destroying. Modern whaling regulations have allowed a heartening recovery by humpback whales, but they are as vulnerable as any other species to changes in the seas. It has been suggested this youngster may have suffocated after inhaling plastic. The Amazon rainforest itself has long been in crisis. More than 3,000 sq miles were deforested between summer 2017 and spring 2018, according to the Brazilian government\u2019s own figures \u2013 the highest rate of destruction ever recorded. We feel all of this when we look at this uncanny displacement.\nIn reality, this mystery is not quite as profound as the headlines imply. The whale was found in a mangrove swamp on the island of Maraj\u00f3 in the Amazon delta. Presumably a storm hurled its carcass deep into the swamp. Yet even if this falls short of a mystery that needs UFOs or the Illuminati to explain it, this surreal and wretched sight has the kind of power that we can\u2019t always get from reading data on sea temperature rises. The scientific evidence that we are pushing nature to its greatest crisis since the extinction of the dinosaurs is abundant. We should be grateful to this whale for giving us an image of the colossal tragedy we are making of our world. A whale in a forest is no more unnatural than plastic on a beach.",

To work with Bob was to learn not only about technical excellence, but also about the history and context of the music; never more so than when performing one of his own compositions.\nBob was born in Sutton Coldfield, the son of Dorothy (nee Tyso), a school secretary, and Frederic Hanson, an electrical engineer. He started piano lessons as a boy, and later learned the organ and viola. He was educated at King Edward\u2019s school, Birmingham, and Southampton University, where he studied music, graduating in 1970, and then obtained his PhD.\nIn 1974 Bob joined the staff of Dartington College of Arts, Devon, teaching composition, analysis and conducting. From 1991 to 2007 he was director of music at Morley College, London, and after that worked as a freelance musician and lecturer. Through Morley College chamber choir, he met Judith Lloyd, and they married in 2009.\nAs a composer, his output included a concerto for the clarinettist David Campbell, a quartet for the Allegri String Quartet (with which he had a long association) and song cycles. Over the past 15 years he turned increasingly to choral works, including a 40-part motet And There Shall Be No Night There, and settings of church music including a mass.\nMost of these were performed by the Borough chamber choir, London, which originated in the Morley College chamber choir. When Bob left Morley, the members decided, unusually, to establish an independent choir which continued to perform under his aegis. Each term the choir worked through a demanding programme chosen by Bob, covering music from the 16th century to the 21st.\nOutside the rehearsal room, he had a tremendous appetite for life, and in particular for cooking, conversation and jokes. It was a concert tradition for him to tell the choir a joke just before they went on stage.\nBob was composing to the last. His final completed work is a string quintet which is due to be performed in Brighton in March.\nHe is survived by Judith, his third wife, by his children, Ros, Pete and Tom, from previous marriages, and grandchildren, Lily, Alfie, Misha and Arlo, and by his brother, Dick.",

The average selling price was just over \u00a3215,000,\nThe profit from each house it sells has nearly tripled since 2013, when the government introduced the help-to-buy scheme in an attempt to help struggling families buy their first home. Last year the company paid an average of just \u00a331,536 for each plot of land, and spent \u00a3112,295 on actually building each home.\nVince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Persimmon of \u201cpinching their profits from the public purse\u201d, adding: \u201cFar from benefiting first time buyers, the major effect of help-to-buy is to drive up demand while having no effect on supply. The result is not help for those who need it, but a boost to the profits of big developers.\u201d\nCable demanded that the government immediately end the help-to-buy scheme and take action to crack down on \u201coutrageous\u201d executive pay. \u201cThis greed is coming at the expense of the public purse through the subsidies in help-to-buy,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp-to-buy is a scam, enriching developers while forcing buyers off the ladder by pushing up prices.\u201d\nGreg Beales, the campaign director of the housing charity Shelter, said: \u201cPersimmon represents everything that is wrong with the housebuilding system. The firm has generated huge profits from taxpayer subsidies whilst doing very little to help solve the housing crisis we face.\n\u201cPiecemeal schemes such as help-to-buy have made the situation even worse by inflating house prices and giving big developers a leg-up \u2013 while doing next to nothing to help those most in need of a genuinely affordable home.\u201d\nMany Persimmon customers have complained that their homes are poorly built, with pipes springing leaks and windows cracking just days after they moved in. Persimmon has been awarded only a three-star Home Builders Federation customer service rating every year since 2014, compared with four and five stars for its major rivals.\nVictoria Baker, who bought a \u00a3380,000 five-bedroom Persimmon house in Ingleby Barwick, near Stockton, last year described the building work on her home as horrific. \u201cWe noticed leaks straight away as we were putting things away under the sink; there was a pool of water under the sink in the kitchen,\u201d she said. Baker, who lives in a home built by Charles Church, a brand owned by Persimmon, said numerous other leaks later appeared. She is part of a Facebook group called \u201cCharles Church (Persimmon) Homes From Hell\u201d.\nPersimmon has made so much money in recent years that it triggered a near-\u00a3500m bonus bonanza for its 150 most senior bosses. The company\u2019s former chair quit when he recognised that the huge bonuses were wrong, but was unable to prevent them being paid out.\nPersimmon\u2019s former chief executive Jeff Fairburn was eventually persuaded to give up part of his payout but still walked away with \u00a375m. His replacement, Dave Jenkinson, collected more than \u00a340m.\nThe company\u2019s huge gains from the help-to-buy scheme, in which the government provides a guaranteed interest-free loan, have sparked a ministerial review. James Brokenshire, the housing minister, is said to be \u201cincreasingly concerned by the behaviour of Persimmon\u201d.\nA source close to the minister said: \u201cGiven that contracts for the 2021 extension to help-to-buy are being reviewed shortly, which overall is a great scheme helping hundreds of thousands of people into home ownership, it would be surprising if Persimmon\u2019s approach wasn\u2019t a point of discussion.\u201d\nA government spokesman said officials would \u201ccarefully\u201d examine the vast profits made by Persimmon and other housebuilders. \u201cHelp-to-buy will look different,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already said it will look only at first-time buyers and we will definitely not be funding leasehold properties. We will look carefully at developer performance over recent years.\u201d\nJenkinson, who was appointed Persimmon\u2019s new chief executive on Tuesday, defended the company\u2019s use of the help-to-buy scheme, saying the company had \u201chelped hundreds of first time buyers\u201d and \u201cgiven them the opportunity to own their own home\u201d.\nHe said the help-to-buy scheme was just one element behind the firm\u2019s financial success and the government had not contacted the company with any concern about its use of the help-to-buy scheme.\nJenkinson said his \u00a340m bonanza \u201cisn\u2019t distracting [him] \u2013 I\u2019m incredibly focused\u201d. He said his bonus payment was tied up in Persimmon shares, which he had no intention of selling soon. He was not paid a bonus in 2018 and will not receive one in 2019. His basic pay is \u00a3518,000.\nMore than a year ago, Fairburn pledged to set up a charity with a \u201csubstantial proportion\u201d of his bonus but has so far failed to do so. He has not registered a charity with the Charity Commission or made any inquiries about how to set one up.\nIndependent property expert Henry Pryor said: \u201cThere is no doubt that help-to-buy has been the crack cocaine of the housing industry. Listen carefully and you can hear the housebuilder bosses chortling into their cornflakes as taxpayers pump up the executive bonus pool.\n\u201cWith 100,000 kids waking up in B&B accommodation this morning, it\u2019s a national outrage that the government is still pouring accelerant on to the smouldering housing market. Bosses who have trousered the profits from selling to taxpayer-supported buyers have taken the place of bankers on my dart board. They have a business model, thanks to successive governments, that would make Al Capone blush.\u201d",

He has gained particular notoriety for regularly locking horns with Donald Trump, who had him ejected from a press conference while on the campaign trail in 2015. The have since sparred over the US president\u2019s proposed border wall among other contentious issues.\nMaduro, who is fending off mounting international pressure to cede power to the opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3, has been accused of regularly detaining journalists. Last month, two French journalists were held after filming outside Miraflores. Numerous local journalists have been harassed or detained in recent years.\nVenezuela\u2019s information minister, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 who is regarded by analysts as Maduro\u2019s chief propagandist \u2013 suggested Ramos was a state department stooge in a tweet. \u201cWe do not lend ourselves to cheap shows,\u201d he went on to say.\nMaduro had until recently favoured interviews with friendly outlets, but in the last month has sat down with more aggressive reporters from the BBC and Euronews, while an ABC crew also interviewed him on Monday.\nThe move against Ramos drew swift condemnation from Human Rights Watch, with the advocacy group\u2019s Americas director, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, calling for the immediate release of Ramos and his crew.\n\u201cThe international community must be alert,\u201d he tweeted on Monday evening, later adding that \u201cJorge Ramos and his team are surrounded by Maduro\u2019s intelligence services (responsible for atrocities).\u201d\nGuaid\u00f3 also attacked Maduro, tweeting that \u201cthe desperation of the usurper is each day more evident, he could even respond to [Ramos\u2019] questions.\u201d\nThe Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,  has drawn criticism from some international observers for refusing to back Guaid\u00f3.\nThe Mexican foreign ministry condemned the crew\u2019s detention after their release on Monday night. \u201cOur country calls for respect for freedom of expression and reiterates its obligation in defense of the security of Mexican citizens abroad,\u201d a tweet read.\nUnivision is the largest Spanish-language network in the US.

        "content": "Duanne Olivier has been flying of late. In his last five Tests the South African fast bowler has taken 31 wickets at 17 runs apiece, including 11 against Pakistan at Pretoria during December. He has just broken into the top 20 of the Test rankings and made his one-day international debut at the start of a year that brings with it the carrot of a World Cup in England.\nBut on Tuesday morning it was announced that Olivier, just 26, was giving up an international career \u2013 or a least placing it in cold storage for a good while \u2013 to sign a three-year deal at Yorkshire via the Kolpak ruling. The club are awaiting final sign-off on the registration that allows an overseas player to play as a local in county cricket provided their country of origin has a free trade agreement with the EU and they qualify for a work permit.\nWhen you can get 18 rand to the pound (and he is said to be earning up to \u00a3150,000 per season at Yorkshire), financial security has won out. His take-home pay as a centrally contracted South Africa player would be roughly a third of his new salary during this time but with no guarantees over selection \u2013 albeit a two-year counter-offer was on the table \u2013 and with uncertainty over the Kolpak route post-Brexit, the lure was too strong.\n\u201cMy decision might be difficult for some to understand but being a professional cricket player is a short-lived career and in order for me to make the most of all my opportunities, I had to consider all my options,\u201d Olivier said in a statement on Instagram.\nYorkshire, having lost Jack Brooks to Somerset and Liam Plunkett to Surrey over the winter, have augmented a bowling attack that was starting to thin out a touch and Martyn Moxon, the club\u2019s director of cricket, is already talking about the initial three-year deal simply being the start of a long and fruitful time at Headingley.\nOlivier is not the first overseas-born cricketer to turn his back on international cricket and opt for the security of county cricket. Last summer there were 14 players registered via the Kolpak ruling and with a raft of dual nationals who hold either British or EU passports also, it is estimated about 15% of county cricketers overall were not qualified for England.\nHe had been pondering this switch for a while, too. Last summer Olivier played as an overseas cricketer at Derbyshire and after 31 wickets in seven first-class matches, rival counties starting making overtures. At the time he had gone a year without an international cap and would have been mindful of South Africa\u2019s quota system, which requires the national team to average six non-white players per game over the course of a year, of whom two must be black.\nBut what is sticking in the craw of South African cricket and swathes of supporters around the world \u2013 not least a fair few from Yorkshire, judging by the response to their announcement on social media \u2013 is that since harbouring such thoughts last year, Olivier had broken into the Proteas Test team in a way that suggested he might prevail.\nJust ask Pakistan\u2019s batsman, who were unable to cope with his hostility during a 3-0 series defeat in which he took 24 wickets. With the recently injury-plagued Dale Steyn now 34 and Vernon Philander just a year younger, many had tipped Olivier, Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi to form South Africa\u2019s seam attack long-term.\nKolpak players can return to international cricket at the end of their county contracts but Cricket South Africa\u2019s chief executive, Thabang Moroe, responded to the news in a way that suggests this may not be an option.\nHe said: \u201cIf one looks at the bigger picture this is not good news for the global game either that a player who has just broken into the top 20 in the ICC Test-match bowling rankings for the first time should opt, effectively, to bring down the curtain on his international career in favour of playing only in domestic leagues.\u201d\nOlivier has clearly not taken the decision lightly and will have been braced for criticism. But his conclusion speaks more about the lopsided nature of cricket\u2019s global financial landscape rather than one man\u2019s career choice. As Ice-T once opined: \u201cDon\u2019t hate the player, hate the game.\u201d",

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, spent \u00a398,000 instructing counsel and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has spent \u00a3600,000, including nearly \u00a3240,000 on barristers.\nThe Metropolitan police and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation are yet to respond to requests for information, but their spending is likely to push the figure for public bodies\u2019 spending beyond \u00a310m.\nLegal costs for the first nine months of the inquiry and the cost of renting rooms at the Holborn Bars conference complex will be published when Moore-Bick delivers his findings from phase one of the inquiry.\nHearings into how the building was refurbished are unlikely to start before the end of the year, and lawyers have started to comb through 200,000 documents that are expected to be disclosed.\nAdvocates for fair inquests and inquiries stressed it was right that there was \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the 568 people \u2013 mostly the bereaved, survivors and residents (BSRs) \u2013 who have been granted core participant status, the 10 public bodies and the 20 commercial organisations involved in the refurbishment.\nDeborah Coles, the director of the Inquest charity, said: \u201cAny concern about cost to the public purse should not fall on the families\u2019 side. The BSRs need to be represented to have their voices heard. You can\u2019t compromise on families\u2019 access to a process that is about finding the truth about what happened.\u201d\nThe inquiry is preparing to move into new premises in west London before the second-phase hearings begin, partly to make room for more lawyers, whose numbers are expected to be swollen by the legal teams of the private companies involved in the refurbishment.\nTwenty companies, including the contractor Rydon, the cladding manufacturer Arconic and the architect Studio E, have already appointed 17 QCs, four barristers, one solicitor advocate and 20 firms of solicitors. Their costs are likely to be met by the companies themselves or their insurers.\nThe inquiry\u2019s own legal team \u2013 four QCs, 22 junior counsel, 10 solicitors and a team of junior barristers and paralegals assembled to review hundreds of thousands of documents \u2013 will further increase the cost to the taxpayer.\nTo limit rising costs, Moore-Bick has told interested parties to share lawyers where possible and has said costs will not be met for \u201csubstantial bodies\u201d or people, such as employees, whose costs could reasonably be expected to be met by such bodies.\nThe cost of the 10-year Savile inquiry into Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland reached \u00a3195m.",

Access to the stores had been denied for six months, and the UN has been warning that the food could rot.\nThe UN is seeking $4.2bn in aid pledges for the whole of 2019, but was not expecting to reach that sum in one conference so early in the year.\nThe main pledges included $500m from Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates each, as well as \u00a3200m from the UK and almost $21m from the United States. The US said it has provided a total of $721m since October 2017. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also each offered $250m in November 2018 for use this year.\nThe Saudis and the UAE \u2013 largely supplied by US and and UK arms manufacturers \u2013 have been fighting to wrest control of the country back from a Houthi-led insurgency that has seized control of the capital, Sana\u2019a, the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, and large tracts of the north of the country bordering Saudi Arabia.\nThe paradox that the wealthy combatants in the civil war are also the largest suppliers of humanitarian aid has been a feature of one of the most brutal and unforgiving of wars. The other big donors on Tuesday were the EU, providing \u20ac161.5m (\u00a3139m), and Kuwait, which provided $250m.\nIn a joint statement, five aid agencies \u2013 Save the Children, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Care International and the International Rescue Committee \u2013 highlighted the paradox of the humanitarian donations from countries involved in the conflict.\nThe statement said: \u201cWe desperately need commitments from some of the very same countries present today to allow unconditional access for humanitarian assistance and commercial imports to all parts of the country. We want to hear world leaders promise to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, and to hold to account those who disregard international law.\n\u201cThe countries selling arms to warring parties in Yemen need to stop these deals with immediate effect and put in place strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms, so that devastating weapons will no longer kill and injure civilians in Yemen. Arms must stop flowing into Yemen and political negotiations need to be supported by all involved in this conflict.\u201d\nWith the talks on a possible withdrawal of Houthi troops out of three coastal ports, including Hodeidah, at an impasse, the UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt will fly to Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE the end of the week to assess the state of negotiations.\nAt the summit in Geneva, UAE speakers accused the Houthis of showing no signs of being willing to honour the commitments made at a peace conference in Stockholm in December.\nBut senior UAE ministers have spoken of waiting as long as June to assess the results of political talks before considering whether to resume an all-out attack on Hodeidah.\nIt is estimated that 24 million people, or 80% of the population of Yemen, is in need of aid. The WFP is now reaching about 10 million Yemenis per month with food aid and hopes to scale up to 12 million this year.",

        "content": "The taxpayer-funded scheme fuels big margins for builders and massive bonuses for their bosses \nPersimmon\u2019s \u00a375m chief executive was too politically toxic to continue in post, but his \u00a340m deputy will do just fine as the new boss. Welcome to the nuanced world of housebuilding in the age of help-to-buy, a place were Persimmon\u2019s pre-tax profit of \u00a31.1bn was not the most remarkable number in its 2018 results. That prize was shared by the 31% operating profit margin and the 53% return on capital employed, solid proof of how former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s subsidy scheme has mostly benefited companies and their executives, not buyers of new homes.\nThe company\u2019s new chief executive, David Jenkinson, can\u2019t fail to be a cuter media performer than his tin-eared predecessor, Jeff Fairburn, but his own spoils from the ludicrous 2012 incentive scheme jar, to put it mildly, with the corporate chant that \u201cPersimmon is changing\u201d.\nIt\u2019s nice that the housebuilder wants to address its substandard scores for customer service, but shouldn\u2019t this thought have occurred when the executives, Jenkinson included, were racking up their millions? Similarly, it\u2019s astonishing that it\u2019s only now, after 150 senior managers have enjoyed their collective \u00a3500m windfall, that Persimmon wants all its lower-paid toilers to earn the full living wage.\nJenkinson will have to rub along on a \u00a3515,000 salary this year with no bonus or incentive top-up. The usual adornments will have to wait until 2020 and, presumably, will be recast in merely conventionally greedy form next time. He\u2019ll survive.\nSo, of course, will Persimmon. If the new corporate do-gooding mantra feels a little windy \u2013 look, we\u2019re even sponsoring Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics! - try the half-baked mutterings coming from government.\nJames Brokenshire, the housing minister, is said to be \u201cincreasingly concerned\u201d by Persimmon and the company\u2019s approach will be \u201ca point of discussion\u201d as help-to-buy contracts are reviewed. Whatever that means, it\u2019s several bricks short of an actual policy, let alone a description of the grounds on which Persimmon could be singled out for punishment.\nBrokenshire should concentrate on the shortcomings of help-to-buy itself. There may have been an argument for stimulating demand for new houses circa 2013, but not now. There is ample evidence that help-to-buy homes are sold at a premium, with the excess providing the rocket fuel for housebuilders\u2019 profits margins. It\u2019s time to unwind the market distortions, and safe to do so. Even if Persimmon\u2019s return of capital were to halve, it would still has a strong financial incentive to keep building. Just call the whole thing off.\n\u201cThis placing certainly gives us a very, very strong capital base from which to continue to grow. I don\u2019t foresee in the short-term to medium-term that we will need to be raising equity.\u201d\nSo said Craig Donaldson, the chief executive of Metro Bank, last July, just after shareholders had been tapped for \u00a3303m to fund more growth. The share price then was \u00a334.22. Now it is \u00a313 and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 Metro is back for another \u00a3350m bite. The \u201cshort-term\u201d carries an imprecise meaning, but Donaldson cannot credibly claim any wriggle room. By any definition, eight months is an indecently brief span between fundraising calls.\nThe major event in the interim was Metro\u2019s confession last month that it had been adding up its numbers the wrong way. The bank had placed about \u00a3900m of loans in the wrong risk bracket, which ranks as a very basic error for a lender. Correction meant the capital ratios were clobbered, thus the new need for more equity. Even the details of the cock-up, however, emerged in stages. Donaldson first suggested Metro found the mistake during an end-of-year review. Several days later the bank had to confirm that, actually, regulators at the Bank of England got there first.\nThe tangled tale damaged Donaldson\u2019s credibility, it was argued here at the time, and the \u00a3350m cash-call takes it down several more notches. The chairman and founder, Vernon Hill, is fully supportive, apparently. It\u2019s hard to understand why other shareholders should be.\nTerrific for Ocado, and full of potential for Marks & Spencer? The stock market\u2019s snap judgment on the impending tie-up was generous. The former\u2019s share price rose 12%, the latter\u2019s 3%.\nWe will await the financial details of the deal to see if that view holds but, on the face of it, Ocado is taking a risk in dumping Waitrose. There are 700,000 Ocado customers and not all will regard M&S\u2019s own-label food offer as a like-for-like substitution.\nWaitrose will clearly lose via the re-arrangement and we may eventually learn why it didn\u2019t negotiate harder, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a win-win for the new duo.",

        "content": "The PM has become a piece of obsolete computer junk only capable of a dying SOS signal\nWhen is a delay not a delay? When it\u2019s an extension. We are now so far through the other side of the Brexit space-time continuum that words have lost all meaning. We are in a universe without rules in which the laws of physics have broken down. Where down is up and up is down. Where days are no longer days. Just event horizons of imagined time. Parallel universes of limitless possibilities.\nIn one of these universes, so small it\u2019s barely even a single dimension, there is a Theresa May, who believes herself to be a reincarnation of the Iron Lady. A prime minister who has stood firm against a troublesome EU and is poised to lead the UK to the Brexit sunlit uplands. In a more familiar world, this new Iron Lady is just a heap of rusting metal. A piece of near obsolete computer junk, the Amstrad Maybot, now incapable of anything more than a dying SOS signal. Unaware she\u2019s even in need of rescue. Just doing the bare minimum to get to the end of the day still in a job.\nIn Sharm El Sheikh on Monday, the prime minister had been adamant. Delay meant delay. And delay was something that could not be countenanced. We would be leaving the EU on 29 March. Less than 24 hours later, she gave a statement to the Commons in which she insisted that whatever she had said the previous day had not in fact been said. Rather than words from the past, they were a singularity. Words from a future of infinite density that had not yet materialised.\nFor the most part, MPs greeted May\u2019s latest exhibition of absurdist performance art in amused silence. Delusion is now priced in to her every appearance at the despatch box, and it takes something exceptional to impress them. Merely saying that yesterday had never happened was nothing particularly out of the ordinary. Besides which, the prime minister\u2019s software is now so unreliable it\u2019s hard to tell if she actually knows what she\u2019s saying, let alone if she means it. Artificial? Certainly. Intelligence? Not so much.\nThen came the key points. May was horrified that some MPs might have thought she was trying to run down the clock and force them into accepting her deal that they had already overwhelmingly rejected, or risk either no deal or no Brexit. So to alleviate any uncertainty, she was going to give parliament the certainty of even longer uncertainty by offering it the chance of delaying Brexit for a couple of months in which nothing would change and then allow the country to go over a cliff edge at the end of June.\n\u201cI will stick by my commitments as I have done previously,\u201d she insisted. Somehow she managed to say this with a straight face. One of the few advantages of being a woman without quality is that she is totally unaware that there are few promises she hasn\u2019t broken. She concluded by praising her government\u2019s record. It was time to celebrate the increased use of food banks and the 600th death of a homeless person in the last year.\nJeremy Corbyn had a bit of explaining to do himself. Having belatedly realised that losing support to the Independent Group wasn\u2019t a particularly good look, the Labour leader had done his own reverse ferret by actually backing a second referendum that he had only ever intended to be entirely cosmetic. Not for the first time, Corbyn managed to give the impression of a man on time delay. Struggling not just to keep up with his own party but the modern world.\nThough a few remainer MPs took some comfort from these unexpected turns of events, most were understandably more concerned that nothing much had changed. Other than that everything difficult had been delayed a few more months. Ken Clarke, Justine Greening, Yvette Cooper, Anna Soubry and Jess Phillips all made passionate speeches begging the prime minister to snap out of her fugue state and act in the national interest.\nMay merely retreated further into her shell. Her ability to misread her audience is uncanny. \u201cSimples,\u201d she said. Brexit as a Compare the Meerkat advert. She couldn\u2019t even say how she would vote if any of the eventualities she was planning for were to occur. There again, she hadn\u2019t even voted for her own motion at the last Brexit vote, choosing to back the Brady amendment instead. It\u2019s a wonder she can even get herself dressed.\nThe Brexiters of the European Research Group looked far more relaxed. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker left the chamber early, confident they would still get their no-deal Brexit sooner or later. Owen Paterson wittered on about badger sentry posts on the Irish border \u2013 he\u2019s yet to find a point he can\u2019t miss \u2013 while Patrick McLoughlin fawned. \u201cMy constituents are in awe,\u201d he simpered. \u201cThe prime minister is breaking new ground.\u201d\nIndeed she is. She has now skipped past David Cameron in the coveted race to be the UK\u2019s worst prime minister of the last 100 years. May headed for the exit. She had survived another day. Or was it yesterday? Or even tomorrow?",

The NHS staff survey also found that increasing numbers of doctors, nurses and other personnel felt disillusioned, were working unpaid overtime and were thinking about quitting.\nExperts said the results showed an \u201calarming downturn\u201d in staff wellbeing that would inevitably damage the care patients received. They said more and more NHS staff were unable to cope with the strain caused by widespread understaffing, years of tight budgets and fast-growing demand for care.\nThe survey, based on responses from 497,000 employees of England\u2019s 230 NHS trusts, provides the most in-depth insight into the concerns and experiences of its 1.2 million-strong workforce.\nOther key findings include:\nA majority (51%) are thinking about leaving their current role and 21% want to quit the NHS altogether.\nMore than three-quarters (78%) feel under unrealistic time pressures some or all of the time.\nNearly six in 10 (58%) say they do unpaid overtime every week, though that number is falling.\nNearly 28% have suffered back pain in the last year as a direct result of their work, up two percentage points since 2017.\nFewer than three in 10 (28.6%) feel their trust takes positive action to improve staff health and wellbeing.\nProf John Appleby, the chief economist at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: \u201cAfter years of holding up against all the odds, today\u2019s figures confirm an alarming downturn in the wellbeing of hardworking NHS staff.\u201d\nHe said the growing proportion of staff falling sick due to stress and the decline in staff health and wellbeing generally were \u201cnot just a matter for staff themselves but have a knock-on effect on patients, too\u201d.\nLabour blamed the findings on government mismanagement of the NHS. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cYears of desperate underfunding, cuts, fragmentation and staff shortages have placed huge pressures on NHS staff, pushing many to feel burnt out and exhausted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frankly appalling that nearly 40% of NHS staff report feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress, alongside the worst levels of health and wellbeing in the last five years. What\u2019s more, satisfaction in the quality of care staff feel they can provide is falling, while a fifth of staff are considering looking for a new job. These are quite staggering findings with huge implications for the quality of care patients receive.\u201d\nPoor morale could exacerbate the already serious understaffing in the NHS, which has more than 100,000 unfilled vacancies \u2013 one in 11 of all posts. The survey found 51% of staff were considering leaving, 30% often thought about leaving the trust they worked for, 22% planned to look for a new job with a different trust in the next year and 16% intended to leave as soon as they could find another job.\nAlmost half (46%) of respondents said their trust was so short of staff that they could not do their job properly.\nOne in seven staff said they had been attacked by a patient or a patient\u2019s relative over the past year, especially ambulance crews and mental health staff. Just under one in five said they had been bullied, harassed or abused by a colleague and 28% had seen an error or near miss in the previous month, up three points year on year and the highest in five years.\nHowever, some positive findings emerged. More than six in 10 staff (62%) said they would recommend their trust as a place to work, 71% would recommend it as a place to be treated (up one point) and 81% were happy with the care they gave patients.\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cI love the NHS \u2013 and it is nothing without its people, who dedicate their lives to caring for us in our times of greatest need. We must place the same emphasis on caring for the carers and our long-term plan for the NHS will build a more modern working culture where everyone feels supported and valued.\n \u201cIt is encouraging to see more staff taking pride in their organisation and feeling able to speak up when they have concerns. But there is so much more to do. Too many staff are feeling physical and mental strain at work, and bullying and discrimination levels are still far too high. This is not acceptable and I will do everything in my power to give NHS staff the support they deserve.\u201d",

The offence carries a potential life sentence.\nThey are appealing against those convictions and were, according to a spokewoman, \u201ddevastated\u201d to receive letters a few days ago from Essex magistrates court ordering them to appear on 15 April for a hearing relating to a separate aggravated trespass charge. During their sentencing for the terror-related charge the court said that the aggravated trespass charge would be adjourned while the appeal against their convictions is considered.\nThey had initially been charged with this offence before the terror-related charge was added.\nThe activists were distressed and bewildered by the letter, according to their lawyer, as they believed they would not have to return to court before their appeal has been considered.\nA spokesman for HM Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) issued an apology to the activists on Tuesday night over the letter. He said: \u201cThis case was incorrectly listed and letters sent in error. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and the hearing on 15 April will be cancelled.\u201d\nThe activists\u2019 lawyer, Raj Chada of Hodge, Jones & Allen solicitors, said the letter ordering the activists back to court has caused them \u201cgreat anxiety and distress\u201d. He questioned whether it was in the interests of justice to pursue the aggravated trespass charge given that prosecutors have already secured convictions against all the activists in relation to the protest incident.\n\u201cAt least HMCTS have retracted and apologised to our clients. It doesn\u2019t take away from the misery that our clients suffered over the weekend. More importantly, it is a temporary reprieve as the CPS are still continuing the case and want it hanging over our clients like the sword of Damocles \u2013 this is not in the public interest.\u201d\nThe 15 activists broke into Stansted airport\u2019s airside area in March 2017 and chained themselves together around a Boeing 767 chartered by the Home Office to deport 60 people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone.\nA spokeswoman for the Stansted 15 said receiving the letters had been \u201cdevastating for us\u201d, adding: \u201cThis kind of legal threat and drawn-out prosecution stretching over years is a small window into the horrendous process people seeking leave to remain with their families and communities face at the hands \u2013 and the mistaken letters \u2013 of the Home Office every single day.\u201d\nFive of the UN\u2019s special rapporteurs on human rights wrote to the UK government on 1 February urging them to \u201crefrain from applying security and terrorism-related legislation to prosecute peaceful protesters\u201d.

        "content": "Shares in both firms surge as they confirm talks, with M&S up 12% and Ocado 3%\nMarks & Spencer is thrashing out the terms of a \u00a31.8bn tie-up with Ocado to belatedly launch a grocery delivery service, replacing the online firm\u2019s current deal with Waitrose.\nShares in both companies surged on Tuesday after they rushed out identical statements that confirmed they were in discussions over a deal in which M&S would buy a 50% stake in Ocado\u2019s UK retail arm for up to \u00a3900m.\nM&S will pay between \u00a3800m and \u00a3900m to enable it to make a late entry into the UK\u2019s \u00a311.4bn online grocery shopping market. The current Ocado/Waitrose service has a customer base of 720,000 shoppers and the ambition would be to convert as many as possible to a new M&S branded food offer.\nNews of a potential alliance leaked in January but neither business would comment on the reports. However, their hand was forced when fresh details of the plan emerged. At the top end the proposed deal, which could be finalised as soon as Wednesday, Ocado\u2019s UK delivery business would be valued at up to \u00a31.8bn.\nAfter nearly a decade as an unloved listed company, Ocado enjoyed a second coming last year after plans to sell its grocery-picking technology to other retailers finally took off. A string of contract wins, including with US supermarket giant Kroger, helped the Ocado share price to double in 2018.\nOcado was the top riser on the FTSE 100 after the retailers confirmed talks, up 12% at 990p, giving the company a market value of \u00a36.8bn. Shares in M&S rose 3% to 303p, valuing it at \u00a34.9bn.\nM&S declined to expand beyond its statement, which said: \u201cMarks & Spencer confirms that it is in discussions with Ocado regarding a joint venture in UK retail. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any agreement or as to the timing of any such agreement.\u201d\nOcado has worked with Waitrose for 20 years but the supply deal between the companies ends in September 2020. Although Ocado already works with Morrisons, the terms of the Waitrose contract would not permit Ocado to work with M&S on the same basis, Ocado boss Tim Steiner confirmed to reporters earlier this month.\nOcado and M&S are thought to be trying to strike a deal before Friday, which is the deadline for Ocado to trigger an 18-month break clause with Waitrose.\nM&S started experimenting with online food delivery in 2017, but its chief executive Steve Rowe has been reluctant to pour money into it at a time when sales in its clothing and food departments are falling. A report in London\u2019s Evening Standard suggested M&S would need to do a cash call on investors to fund the deal.\nFamous for inventing ready meals, M&S\u2019s foodhalls are popular with small households and lazy chefs, so there are several hurdles to overcome if it is to become a destination for the weekly or monthly shop. Its food departments sell just 7,000 products, compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops, with the average spend just \u00a313, well below Ocado\u2019s minimum order value of \u00a340. The traditional focus is on exclusive own-brand products rather than the big name grocery brands.\nJefferies retail analyst James Grzinic said the proposed deal looked like a good one for Ocado but the runes were harder to read for M&S: \u201cWe would be wary of the ability for the M&S brand to support a basket size of the magnitude required to make the online economics work.\u201d\nThe John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, was one of the early investors in Ocado but sold its holding for about \u00a3150m in 2011. During the past decade, the employee-owned retailer has been competing with Ocado via its own delivery service, Waitrose.com, which fills shoppers\u2019 orders from its stores\u2019 shelves, as well as a fulfilment centre in Coulsdon, south London. Waitrose.com covers 80% of UK postcodes.\nOcado suffered a setback three weeks ago when a huge fire \u2013 on the same day as the company\u2019s annual results \u2013 destroyed its warehouse in Andover, Hampshire. After the fire, investors took fright, with more than \u00a31bn wiped off the firm\u2019s stock market value. However, the share price has been staging a recovery and is now close to pre-fire levels of about \u00a310.",

The ship, now a branch of the Imperial War Museum, hosted the medal presentation in its ward room.\nDenis Haley, 92, was at 17 a signalman on HMS Southward Ho and one of a team who towed parts of the Mulberry harbours from Portsmouth to Arromanches-les-Bains, then remained off the beach as part of a flotilla of small ships fitted with Esso smoke-making equipment until mid-July 1944.\nAsked what he most remembered, he replied: \u201cMostly the noise, it was overwhelming, 24 hours a day. [The] noise of gunfire. The noise of the ships. You have to hear it to appreciate it.\u201d\nAlso honoured were Charles Kavanagh, 92, an able seaman who helped land tanks on Sword beach on D-day; Patrick Reardon, 93, a seaman in the RN combined operations on HMS Sheffield who landed on Omaha beach on 6 June; and John Nicholls, who served on HMS Argonaut on D-day, fired on and destroyed German gun batteries on Normandy and drove landing craft from ship to shore delivering troops and supplies.\nNicholls remembered being told of the D-day plan with just four hours to go and arriving in France to see \u201call hell\u201d break loose.\n\u201cI looked at some of those troops, and as they were going in I thought: I wonder how many of them are going to come back.\u201d He lost 65% of his hearing from the noise of explosions during the battle. \u201cI\u2019ve come out of it with just half of my hearing gone, but those poor devils \u2026 they lost their lives. I think of them all the time,\u201d he\n said.\nJouyet said it was a \u201cvery great honour\u201d for him to be onboard HMS Belfast to express France\u2019s gratitude. \u201cAt a time when Europe was dominated by a terrible dictatorship, France was able \u2013 from the first few hours of the war \u2013 to count on the support of its closest partner. The commitment to the law and democratic principles on which our societies are based inspired a shared battle for freedom. Long live Franco-British friendship,\u201d he said.\nReferring to the 75th anniversary commemorations, Williamson said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we remember the enormous sacrifice that was made, the enormous courage that was shown, the fact that so many people were willing to step up.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAs so many nations come together on the 5th and 6th of June, not just in Portsmouth but also in Normandy, the real people who are at the centre of those commemorations and celebrations about how we liberated Europe are going to be those veterans who were willing to give everything for the freedoms that we enjoy today.\n\u201cWhat I think is important to do is to retell the stories that they have, continue to tell the next generation [about] the contribution that they made in fighting for the values that we do hold so dear to our heart today.\u201d",

Root, however, is not one of them.\nSpeaking on the eve of Wednesday\u2019s fourth one-day international against West Indies in Grenada, where better weather is hoped for after Monday\u2019s washout, the 28-year-old outlined why he passed on the option to rest for the three-match Twenty20 series that ends this Caribbean tour.\n\u201cI love playing cricket for England, simple as that,\u201d said Root. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve not had much opportunity to play Twenty20 cricket in the last couple of years. I don\u2019t want to miss out on opportunities to play when I\u2019m fit and I feel I\u2019m in a good place.\u201d\nWhile Root is striving to repeat such short-form feats as his 44-ball 83 against South Africa in the 2016 World Twenty20 \u2013 a recent spell in Australia\u2019s Big Bash League was somewhat disappointing \u2013 then in ODI cricket he knows his game inside out.\nThis came to the fore during the opening fixture in Barbados, when his controlled 102 from 97 balls helped England successfully chase a target of 361. It was Root\u2019s 14th ODI century in 116 innings, during which he became the fastest Englishman past 5,000 runs in the format and the fourth quickest overall. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t hit as many sixes as others might do, I still feel I can score as quickly,\u201d said Root. \u201cIt won\u2019t always be the case but it\u2019s an area I\u2019m always trying to get better [at]. If I can add that to what I\u2019ve got already, I\u2019d like to think you\u2019ll see even more improvement.\n\u201cI can\u2019t hit the ball over the stands like Chris Gayle can consistently, unless there is a gale-force wind and I\u2019ve got a top edge off a 95mph bowler. You have to play to your strengths. You always look for ways to get better but getting the best out of yourself is the main thing.\u201d\nThe Twenty20 series in St Lucia and St Kitts may be where some of England\u2019s fringe players get their chance to impress before the World Cup squad is selected, with Eoin Morgan\u2019s side expected to return to full strength on Wednesday in an attempt to take a 2-1 lead with one to play. It means Ben Stokes is due to return after a minor ankle knock, with Alex Hales dropping back down.\nWest Indies, meanwhile, will make a late decision on whether to add the newly arrived Andre Russell to their team. The Jamaican all-rounder\u2019s ability to bowl is possibly hampered by a long-standing knee problem but with the bat he still represents a significant threat.\nWhile Root will plough on to the end of the tour, the England management have now decided that Moeen Ali will join Stokes and Jos Buttler on the flight home after Saturday\u2019s fifth ODI in St Lucia, with Sam Curran, the left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, flying out as a slightly indirect replacement.\nThe final two Twenty20s are not scheduled to be shown on Sky television in the UK due to their sitting outside the original rights package. Cricket West Indies is currently understood to be in negotiations with Sony, the host broadcaster, in an effort to change this.\nEngland (likely): J Roy, J Bairstow, J Root, E Morgan(*), B Stokes, J Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, C Woakes, A Rashid, L Plunkett, M Wood\nWest Indies (likely): C Gayle, J Campbell, S Hope (wk), S Hetmyer, D Bravo, J Holder(*), A Russell, A Nurse, D Bishoo, O Thomas, S Cottrell",

Leicester have also agreed to pay Celtic compensation of around \u00a36m to secure Rodgers\u2019 signature.\n\u201cI\u2019m very privileged and honoured to be here as Leicester City manager and I\u2019ll give my life to make the supporters proud of their club,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll be stronger and I\u2019m looking forward to working with the players, staff and supporters to make the right steps forward.\u201d\nRodgers will take charge of the team for the first time at Watford \u2013 the club where he began his managerial career \u2013 on Sunday, and will be in attendance for Tuesday\u2019s home game against Brighton. He will be joined at Leicester by assistant coach Chris Davies, fitness coach Glen Driscoll and first-team coach Kolo Tour\u00e9.\n\nRodgers' first job as manager comes at then-Championship Watford, following coaching stints\u00a0at Reading and Chelsea, where he worked as a youth coach for four years.\nRodgers returns to Reading as manager, with the club paying Watford compensation to sign him \u2013 but his tenure lasts just six months and he departs with the club in relegation trouble.\nThe Northern Irishman's next job proves his breakthrough, as Rodgers leads Swansea to the Premier League, winning the play-offs in his first season. Their success continues in the top flight as they finish 11th in the 2011-12 season.\nRodgers replaces Kenny Dalglish at Liverpool, leading them to seventh in his first season before a dramatic title charge in 2013-14 with an attacking side led by Luis Su\u00e1rez.\u00a0\nLiverpool ultimately finish second behind Manchester City, but can only come sixth the following year after Su\u00e1rez departs. After a slow start to the 2015-16 campaign, Rodgers is sacked with J\u00fcrgen Klopp replacing him.\nAfter seven months out of football, Rodgers returns at Celtic and achieves total dominance in Scotland. Celtic have won seven trophies in his short tenure, and are on the verge of a treble-treble with the 46-year-old set to join Leicester.\nRodgers moves to his sixth club \u2013 and third in the Premier League \u2013 replacing Claude Puel on a contract until June 2022.\nCeltic had given permission for Rodgers to hold talks with Leicester earlier on Tuesday, and have now confirmed the interim appointment of former manager Lennon, who left Hibernian in January. Lennon will take over until the end of the season, joined by assistant manager John Kennedy and coach Damien Duff.\n\u201cI am absolutely delighted to be named manager of Celtic again,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThis is a club which has been such a huge part of my life already, and it is an honour to be asked to return.\n\u201cI have given everything to Celtic as a player and manager already in my career and I am ready to do the same again \u2026 I am returning to one of the biggest and best clubs in world football and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\nLeicester had long viewed Rodgers as an ideal successor to Claude Puel but there were doubts as to whether he could be persuaded to leave Celtic in the middle of the season, with the Scottish champions on course to win a third domestic treble in succession.\nRodgers explained why he believed this to be the right moment to size an opportunity to return to the Premier League. \u201cI think there was a number of reasons. I was certainly in no hurry to leave Celtic. [It] is a club that\u2019s huge worldwide, a renowned club, and I loved working with the players there.\n\u201cWe were on a journey of great success over these last years but when the opportunity came to talk to Leicester and I was able to analyse it, it allowed me to think that I\u2019d probably achieved and taken the club maybe as far as I could at this moment.\u201d\n#WelcomeBrendan \ud83e\udd8a\nRodgers inherits a talented squad at Leicester that has underperformed this season, with some players and many supporters disenchanted with Puel\u2019s style. Writing in the programme for the Brighton match, the club\u2019s vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said \u201clong-term progress had been compromised\u201d under the Frenchman.\nRodgers has vowed to get the club back on an upward trajectory. \u201cMy message is that together we\u2019ll be stronger and on and off the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s make the right steps forward and I look forward to making [the fans] proud of their team.\u201d\n\u201cMy natural environment is on the grass, working with players. I want them to be really aggressive in the game, both with and without the ball, so those will be the messages early on. The one thing I\u2019ve always known with the Premier League, it gets quicker each season.\n\u201cI felt that when I was there with Swansea and Liverpool and it doesn\u2019t look any different to that, so I\u2019m really looking forward to the challenge of coming to work with the players. They seem a very honest group of boys who want to work well. We want to give them the confidence and clarity to play to a level that I believe they can play at.\u201d\nThe Celtic chief executive, Peter Lawwell, has paid tribute to Rodgers\u2019 success with the team: \u201cBrendan is a football manager of the highest quality and we are very disappointed to see him leave the club,\u201d Lawwell said.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity he wished to pursue and that is something we have to respect. He gave the club so much and has created so many wonderful memories for our supporters. His achievements are historic.\u201d\nLawwell has also welcomed Lennon back to Celtic Park. \u201cIn bringing Neil back to the Club until the end of the season, we have appointed a man who knows what it means to be Celtic manager and someone who knows how to win. We know he has the commitment and desire needed to face the challenges ahead.\u201d",

An extension beyond the end of June would involve the UK taking part in the European parliament elections.\nCabinet ministers are keen for May to use any delay to try to force a cross-party consensus.\nThe no-deal notice said customs checks alone could cost businesses \u00a313bn a year and that it was impossible to predict the impact of new tariffs. It said this was partly because the government\u2019s communications to businesses and individuals about the need to prepare for no deal had not been effective.\nIt said small- to medium-sized businesses were not making basic preparations despite government advice to do so. Only 40,000 of 240,000 businesses that had no experience of customs or tariffs had registered for an economic operator registration and identification number.\nThe government said that while it might wave hauliers through British ports, \u201cthey would be stopped if taking goods into France without the right paperwork\u201d. This amounts to the most robust rebuttal yet of Brexiter claims that there would be no delays because the British would be taking a loose approach to checks and controls.\nEvidence suggested the public had not been heeding no-deal warnings either, with no \u201cnoticeable behaviour change\u201d witnessed on a \u201csignificant scale\u201d over the need to renew passports, and get international driving permits and green cards for insurance for driving in the EU, it said.\nThe EU, which would treat the UK as a third country in the event of no deal, could impose tariffs of 70% on beef exports, 45% on lamb and 10% on cars, it said.\n\u201cThis would be compounded by the challenges of even modest reductions in flow at the border.\u201d\nThe impact on the economy would vary across the UK, with Wales and Scotland\u2019s economies estimated to be about 8% smaller under a no deal scenario over the next 15 years, when compared to today\u2019s arrangements. In the Northern Ireland, the economy would be 9% smaller and in the north-east of England 10.5% smaller.\nIt added: \u201cOverall, the cumulative impact from a no-deal scenario is expected to be more severe in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, and to last for longer.\u201d\nThis was because of expected disruption in the \u201cclosely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland. There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure.\u201d\nScottish fishing would be badly hit as would Welsh sheep farming, with 92% of its lamb being exported to the EU, confirming the sector\u2019s previous warnings that it could be \u201cwiped out\u201d by no deal.\nThe notice said the impact on the food and drink sector would be most pronounced in Wales, Scotland and particularly Northern Ireland, where the sector comprises 5.07% of the economy, compared to 1.38% for England.\nIt said fewer than one in 10 items would be affected by delays on the channel crossings but, because of the timing of a potential no-deal Brexit, supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables could be hit hardest.\n\u201cIn the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario,\u201d it said.\nThe government revealed there were significant delays to critical projects being undertaken in preparation for no deal.\n\u201cIn February, departments reported being on track for just under 85% of no-deal projects but, within that, on track for just over two thirds of the most critical projects,\u201d it said.\nThe document confirmed that the Treasury had made more than \u00a34bn available for no-deal planning, \u00a32bn of which was allocated in December to support preparations for the 2019-20 financial year.",

Plus: Theresa May promises chance to avoid no-deal Brexit\nGood morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 27 February.\nThe Vatican will await Cardinal George Pell\u2019s appeal before taking action. The news that Pell \u2013 who was in charge of the Holy See\u2019s finances and rooting out corruption at the heart of the church \u2013 had been found guilty on five charges of sexual abuse was \u201cpainful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia\u201d, said a Vatican press spokesman, Alessandro Gisotti. But survivors and activists are enraged at the church\u2019s decision not to strip Pell of his position as a cardinal, at least until the judicial process is exhausted. The Vatican says a ban on Pell exercising ministry or having contact with minors will remain in place.\nAs Melissa Davey writes: \u201cMonths of silence and pressure on those in the trial has lifted. But the story is far from over.\u201d She can finally reveal what it was like inside the courtroom. Guardian Australia\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, who attended court every day during the trial, recounts the jury selection: \u201cNine men and five women were sworn in, among them a church pastor, a mathematician, a chef and a schoolteacher\u201d; Pell\u2019s demeanour: \u201cmoving slowly with the assistance of a cane because of an injured knee\u201d; what he ate for lunch: \u201cpickle sandwiches, sausage rolls and milkshakes\u201d; and the contrasting styles of the defence barrister, Robert Richter, who closed by warning jurors that if they convicted Pell: \u201cYou can\u2019t can\u2019t come back and say, \u2018Oops, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake,\u201d and the crown prosecutor, Mark Gibson. Here, in case you missed it, is David Marr on Pell\u2019s conviction. Scott Morrison is heading to Tasmania to support his \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d plan. As part of this week\u2019s attempted climate policy pivot, his government will flag a willingness to use its controversial taxpayer underwriting program for new power generation projects to boost the proposal, even though the project did not make a submission asking for support through that mechanism. A feasibility study for the Tasmanian interconnector proposal now being supported by the government makes it clear the benefits are greater \u201cwhen approximately 7,000MW of the national electricity market\u2019s present coal-fired generation capacity retires\u201d.\nThe government\u2019s contentious ParentsNext welfare program is having \u201cdevastating\u201d impacts on participants, a Senate inquiry has been told. In one submission, the father of two children with autism said he had been handed a \u201cgeneric\u201d plan, which required him to take his daughter to a story-time session. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s diagnosis means this is poorly suited to her,\u201d he said. \u201cI explained and was ignored when I detailed the time commitments I already have. For example, in the 25 business days preceding the appointment \u2026 I had to attend 23 separate medical appointments with/for various family members. \u201cI requested a follow-up appointment to resolve this. Whilst waiting the week for my return interview, my payment was cut for noncompliance with the plan.\u201d\nTheresa May has promised MPs the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit and possibly delay the departure date, while repeatedly declining to say whether or not she and the government would support such moves. In a significant first concession that Brexit could take place after 29 March, following months of insistence the deadline could not be shifted, May sought to appease restive Conservative backbenchers, but prompted concern from pro-Brexit MPs.\nMichael Cohen, longtime lawyer and aide to Donald Trump, is set to deliver explosive testimony to Congress and could detail how Trump broke the law while in office, according to US media reports.\nIn one of the more awkward double bookings in diplomatic history, the Hanoi hotel meant to serve as the US press corps headquarters was also reserved by Kim Jong-un. Such cohabitation was never going to work for the North Korean security apparatus, which is not accustomed to dealing with inquisitive journalists. Meanwhile, Dutch customs officials at the port of Rotterdam have seized 90,000 bottles of vodka believed to have been destined for the North Korean leader and his army chiefs.\nThe Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is under pressure to reject the resignation of his foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who had announced his departure on Monday with a condemnation of what he described as the \u201cdeadly poison\u201d of infighting among the country\u2019s parties and factions.\nA letter from Emma Thompson makes clear her reasons for quitting the film Luck after the disgraced executive John Lasseter was announced as the new head of Skydance Media, the production company behind the film. \u201cI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year,\u201d Thomson wrote in a letter shared with the LA Times. \u201cBut I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\u201d\nAn old green notebook believed to contain poetry written by the notorious outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow has been put up for auction by Barrow\u2019s nephew. Parker was known to have written poetry. Jeff Guinn\u2019s biography of the outlaws, Go Down Together, recounts how she wrote verses \u2013\u00a0including The Story of Suicide Sal, about a naive country girl who falls for a man who lures her into crime \u2013 while in prison. But the notebook, which was among a collection of items belonging to Barrow\u2019s older sister Nell May Barrow and put up for auction by her son, reveals that Clyde Barrow also tried his hand as a poet.\n\u201cWhen just last month Vic Marks used a few broad brushstrokes to describe \u2018a young batsman who commands attention \u2026 a left-hander who has a bit of swagger and likes to hit the ball\u2019, it was the first time the play of Shimron Hetmyer had been described for the Guardian reader,\u201d writes Andy Ball. \u201cWatching and reading about England\u2019s tour of the West Indies the picture of a 22-year-old of considerable style and promise has continued to fill out, as Hetmyer has blossomed into everyone\u2019s new favourite batsman.\u201d\nThe former Sri Lanka opening bat and captain Sanath Jayasuriya has been banned from all cricket activities for two years after admitting breaching two counts of the International Cricket Council\u2019s anti-corruption code.\nThe lawyer and Guardian writer Richard Ackland writes that \u201cthe suppression order on the George Pell trial, which prevented media from reporting that the Catholic church\u2019s third most senior member had been found guilty of child sexual assault, left a pretty big gap in the community\u2019s knowledge of a serious event in the affairs of the nation\u201d.\n\u201cNow that we know there will be no second trial, the suppression order remaining in place against reporting the verdict on the first trial looks, to my mind and in this age of the ubiquitous internet, rather nonsensical. While the rest of the world has moved on and embraced the internet and its copious supply of information, the courts are stuck in another place. Can the jury system exist alongside an internet where information flows freely? Can judges admit that the internet exists? Do injunctions have a sensible place in the internet age? The idea that the administration of justice should take precedence over society\u2019s right to know is an idea whose time has run out.\u201d\nScott Morrison will announce a royal commission into the treatment of people with disabilities, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Senior government sources have confirmed that Ita Buttrose will lead the ABC, with an announcement likely this week, according to the Australian. The Washington Post reveals that the US military blocked Russian troll factory the Internet Research Agency \u2013 which is underwritten by an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin \u2013 from the internet during the 2018 midterms.\nLabor will announce a $3.2m fund to help country kids go to university amid new figures that show a vast disparity between city and regional university entrants rates.\nLabor and the Greens politicians are expected to accept a change.org petition at the ParentsNext Senate Inquiry in Melbourne today calling for the welfare program to be made voluntary.\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.",

        "content": "From reluctant People\u2019s Voter Corbyn to pragmatic McDonnell and the referendum sceptics\nA longtime Eurosceptic, the Labour leader has long struggled to balance the tensions between his overwhelmingly pro-remain membership \u2013 including many of those young activists who joined to support him \u2013 and the party\u2019s voters in leave-leaning constituencies.\nNotwithstanding the jubilant response of supporters of a People\u2019s Vote to Labour\u2019s shift this week, Corbyn is unlikely to be making tub-thumping speeches calling on voters to stop Brexit any time soon.\nHe made clear in his speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday that what Labour has in mind, if Theresa May\u2019s deal or some version of it passes the Commons, is \u201ca confirmatory public vote to see if people feel that that is what they voted for\u201d. And meanwhile, he will keep pressing home Labour\u2019s alternative Brexit plan.\nEver the canny political operator, McDonnell shares Corbyn\u2019s Euroscepticism, but has been keen to ensure the party\u2019s divisions over Brexit do not endanger the bigger project of securing the most leftwing Labour government since 1945.\nSo at various tense moments in the past year or so, it has been McDonnell who has leaned towards a referendum in public, in the hope of calming simmering rebellions.\nIt was McDonnell, together with Keir Starmer, who was deputed to talk to the backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson about their planned amendment calling for a confirmatory referendum on May\u2019s deal, if it is agreed. And he has simultaneously been pressing Corbyn and his close advisors on toughening up their response to antisemitism.\nThe shadow Brexit secretary is, with good reason, seen as the primary voice in Corbyn\u2019s top team who advocates for a softer Brexit, and also for a second referendum.\nHis private views on the issue are clearly some way from those of Corbyn, but during his two-plus years in the role Starmer has maintained the difficult balancing act of staying sufficiently on-message to be publicly loyal while trying to nudge the party position closer to embracing the possibility of a second referendum.\nHis position has been boosted by Corbyn\u2019s decision to finally back a second referendum, and Starmer was quickly on the airwaves to insist such a ballot must have remain as an option.\nA distinct group from the smaller band of openly pro-leave Labour MPs, such as Kate Hoey and John Mann. They argue that advocating a second referendum could badly damage the party\u2019s chances in leave-backing former industrial areas.\nThis group, which includes the Don Valley MP Caroline Flint and Stoke MPs Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth, has been courted by the Conservatives as possible backers of May\u2019s Brexit deal, if given assurances over areas such as workers\u2019 rights.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s Brexit debate in the Commons, Flint hit out at Labour\u2019s embrace of a new referendum, saying the decision to leave \u201chas been made by the British people\u201d. Snell said he \u201cwill not, shall not and cannot vote for a second referendum, regardless of how much lipstick is put on it\u201d.\nAnother mini-tribe on the Labour benches are notably more remain-minded, but still dislike the idea of a second referendum.\nOne of the more vocal of these is Stephen Kinnock, the Aberavon MP who backs a Norway-style soft departure, but has spoken out strongly against a new vote.\nAfter the meeting of Labour MPs on Monday where the decision was announced to opt for a second referendum, Stephen Kinnock said he had \u201cdeep reservations\u201d.\n\u201cI think it would be deeply divisive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Amendment demands that the government starts preparing for new public vote on Brexit\nThe Independent Group (TIG) has tabled an amendment in the Commons demanding that the government starts preparing for a second EU referendum, in an attempt to recapture the initiative on Brexit a day after Labour promised to support moves for a public vote next month.\nThe amendment from the 11-strong group of MPs has the support of the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru and is aimed at provoking a fresh split in Labour by wooing MPs who want the party to support a new vote immediately.\nChris Leslie, who defected from Labour last week, called on his former party for support. \u201cIf the Labour leadership support this amendment, we could make real progress on a people\u2019s vote. Now is the time to put the national interest first. Parliament must act now.\u201d\nIn reality, Labour\u2019s leadership is unlikely to support TIG\u2019s amendment because Jeremy Corbyn wants to continue pursuing his own Brexit plan, starting by putting it to a vote in the Commons on Wednesday.\nThe Labour leader is likely to seek a fresh meeting with Theresa May and will press her to offer civil service support to work his party\u2019s proposals into a coherent plan. Under Labour\u2019s proposals, the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit and aim for a close relationship with the single market.\nTIG leaders hope that some Labour MPs who have been pressing for a second referendum could yet back their amendment, but one Labour MP who is close to the People\u2019s Vote campaign was sceptical that they would. \u201cMost of us will ignore it, I suspect,\u201d the source said.\nIn any event, the TIG amendment would have to be selected by John Bercow, the Speaker, to be voted on. It is not certain it will be picked for debate, though the support of Westminster\u2019s third largest party, the SNP, significantly boosts its chances.\nIf selected it would be the first time that a motion calling for a second referendum has been debated by MPs, but there is no prospect of it passing the Commons because of the lack of Labour backing.\nOn Monday, Corbyn told a private meeting of his party\u2019s MPs that the Labour leadership would support a second referendum on May\u2019s Brexit deal if Labour could not get a majority behind its own Brexit plan in the coming days.\nHe repeated the pledge in public, promising that a \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d would be held if May\u2019s Brexit deal were to pass through parliament next month, despite complaints about the new policy in the shadow cabinet.\nCorbyn told MPs: \u201cWe cannot risk our country\u2019s industry and people\u2019s livelihoods, so if it somehow passes in some form at a later stage, we believe there must be a confirmatory public vote to see if people feel that that is what they voted for.\u201d\nLabour has been careful not to spell out exactly what a \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d would entail. Corbyn is understood to be believe the party must give leave voters a \u201ccredible proposal\u201d that they could vote for in a referendum.\nThat would not be satisfied by a revised version of May\u2019s deal, even if it had won the support of parliament. But one MP questioned if such a plan made sense. \u201cSo, what, we\u2019d back a referendum to oppose our own deal if we managed to get it through parliament?\u201d\nLabour sources said there had been a vocal backlash against the decision at a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with some dissent that it had not been discussed and agreed to at a full meeting of the party body.\nJohn Mann, a backbencher and Brexit supporter, criticised the party\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d shift to support a second referendum. \u201cVoters won\u2019t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg. It didn\u2019t end very well for him on tuition fees.\u201d\nKeir Starmer, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said he was \u201cwell aware of different views across my own party\u201d. Party sources concerned about a second referendum said at least two dozen MPs would vote against or defy the whip in a Commons vote.\nSeparately, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, postponed an event for Labour MPs and peers in the party\u2019s \u201csocial democratic tradition\u201d that had been due to take place on Tuesday night in Westminster.\nIt had been billed by some supporters as a chance to rally support in the party against Corbyn\u2019s leadership, but other Labour MPs who might be considered supportive of Watson said any attempt to form a separate grouping to threaten the leader would be unpopular with them.\nFriends of Watson said the meeting, open to all backbenchers, would be held in the next couple of weeks instead. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a discussion about how to ensure pluralism within the party, how to get the voice of that tradition heard and also positive policy work about future facing issues,\u201d one ally said.",

Hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms and should have been among its \u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d (RWAs). The bank originally suggested it had discovered the issue itself, but it later emerged that the error was caught by the UK regulator.\nWithin days of the disclosure on 23 January, the bank\u2019s stock price fell from about \u00a322 per share to a record low of \u00a310.87, before recovering.\nThe share price went into reverse again on Tuesday after the new fundraising plan was announced, closing down nearly 16% at \u00a313.\nDonaldson said during a call with analysts that he \u201cdeeply\u201d regretted the adjustments and acknowledged the executive team \u201cdid not deliver the standards\u201d that should be expected of the bank. \u201cThe buck stops with me and I am sorry about that,\u201d he said.\nThe bank confirmed that City regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, intended to investigate the circumstances that led to the accounting failure.\nNews of Donaldson\u2019s scrapped bonus came as Metro Bank announced it was again going cap in hand to shareholders to try to raise a further \u00a3350m\nThe challenger bank raised \u00a3303m from investors last July and Donaldson then ruled out further cash calls to fuel the lender\u2019s growth. However, Metro Bank announced on Tuesday that it planned another equity sale in the first half of 2019 after consulting shareholders.\nFounded in 2010, Metro Bank brought forward its full year earnings results by a day to Tuesday, reporting pre-tax profits up 130% on an underlying basis to \u00a336.6m, slightly below consensus estimates of \u00a339m.\nDonaldson said 2018 was a \u201csuccessful year of strong growth despite a challenging operating environment\u201d.",

The crack is spreading to the east. This rift, known as the Halloween crack, is set to intersect with another fissure that was apparently stable for the past 35 years but is now accelerating north at a rate of around 2.5 miles a year.\nOnce these two rifts meet, which could happen within weeks, an iceberg of at least 660sq miles is set to be loosened.\nThis process, also known as calving, occurs naturally with ice shelves but \u201crecent changes are unfamiliar in this area\u201d and could lead to the destabilization of the Brunt ice shelf, Nasa warned.\n\u201cThe likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible,\u201d said Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with Nasa and the University of Maryland Baltimore County.\nWhile the anticipated iceberg is large by most measures, it is dwarfed by other recent Antarctic breakaways. In July 2017, one of the largest ever icebergs calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. At 2,200sq miles it was nearly twice the size of the US state of Delaware.\nThe long-term future of Antarctic ice shelves will have a major influence on sea level rise around the world. A report released by US and UK scientists last year stated that ice in Antarctica is melting at a record-breaking rate, posing a major threat to coastal cities.\nThe study found that melting of the ice sheet has accelerated threefold in the last five years. Unless drastic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming, scientists estimate that Antarctica\u2019s melting ice should add more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070.",

        "content": "PM offers extension vote as she\u2019s urged to face down Eurosceptic wing of party\nCabinet ministers have told Theresa May she must use any delay to Brexit to face down the Eurosceptic wing of the party and forge a consensus in parliament, as the prime minister finally conceded to offer a vote on extending article 50.\nMay reluctantly promised MPs they would have the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit next month and also offered a vote to extend article 50 in an attempt to stave off the threat of dozens of resignations from her frontbench.\nIn an earlier stormy cabinet meeting, where May announced her plan, the Guardian understands the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, both said any extension of the Brexit talks must be used \u201cto find a new coalition in parliament\u201d.\nThe comments, which are likely to further irritate Tory Eurosceptics, strongly suggest an extension is most likely to result in the softening of May\u2019s proposed deal in order to bring Labour MPs on board.\nIn her statement to the Commons on Tuesday, May said she planned to hold the next meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March. If it was defeated again, it would be followed by a vote on 13 March on leaving with no deal and, if this was rejected, a vote on 14 March for an extension to article 50.\nAt the cabinet meeting, Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, was among those most angered by the decision to offer a vote on an extension and suggested some cabinet ministers had undermined the prime minister. Treasury secretary Liz Truss called the trio \u201ckamikaze\u201d ministers, according to several sources.\nRudd, along with the justice secretary, David Gauke, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, warned the prime minister in private last week that she must rule out a no-deal Brexit or risk dozens of ministerial resignations.\nClark, Rudd and Gauke then wrote in the Daily Mail that Brexit should be delayed if a deal was not passed by mid-March. While Hammond did not sign up to the public statements from his ministerial colleagues threatening to defy Tory whips and back the Cooper-Letwin amendment, allies insisted the chancellor \u201cdoes his lobbying inside the tent\u201d.\nEven the party\u2019s chair and May loyalist, Brandon Lewis, said ministers should be cautious about the framing of no deal, pointing out the option was supported by many Tory members. Rudd told Lewis, however, that the cabinet \u201cneeded to be straight with the British people\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a bitter pill to swallow,\u201d one cabinet source said. \u201cBut ultimately we felt like we had been left with no other option. There has been a private back-and-forth. Should we just let people resign? But that causes its own party problems, too.\u201d\nThe promise to vote on a Brexit delay is likely to avert a serious ministerial rebellion. Dozens had been privately threatening to back an amendment on Wednesday to the government\u2019s latest Brexit motion, which would have paved the way for legislation to extend article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline.\nThe amendment had been tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper and the Tories Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, but the latter pair said they believed their concerns had now been appeased by the prime minister\u2019s pledge to hold the three votes in mid-March.\nThe cross-party coalition led by Cooper still tabled three amendments to the government\u2019s motion, but was likely to push only one of them to a vote. It sets out the promises made by May on Tuesday in a form that MPs can vote for, giving them added reassurance that neither the prime minister nor other cabinet ministers will go back on those promises.\nCooper said the amendment would \u201cpin down and confirm the commitment made by the prime minister today\u201d to hold the series of votes.\nThe coalition was awaiting further reassurances from ministers on Wednesday, including from the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay. If it sensed any backsliding, it could still push for a vote on the two other amendments.May\u2019s spokesman said no decisions had been made on whether the government would support an extension and the prime minister would focus instead on securing a deal MPs could support.\nCabinet sources suggested any decision on whipping MPs to vote a certain way would only be made once the meaningful vote had been lost. \u201cWhy would we take a decision on whipping before it is absolutely necessary?\u201d one cabinet source said. \u201cYou are only going to inflame people on either side.\u201d\nDespite the apparent win for the soft Brexiters in cabinet, government officials remain anxious that a no-deal Brexit may simply be delayed by a couple of months, with a second extension highly unlikely. \u201cYou can probably only pull that cord once,\u201d a Whitehall source said.\nAfter a meeting of the Brexit hardliner European Research Group, MPs said they still held out hope that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, could deliver a suitable compromise on the Irish border backstop to allow MPs to back May\u2019s deal.\nThe group\u2019s chair, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the vote \u201cdoesn\u2019t change anything enormously \u2026 it remains the position that we hope that the prime minister will be able to secure changes we will be able to accept\u201d.\nHe said the group recognised that there was unlikely to be the parliamentary numbers to leave with no deal. \u201cThere is no enthusiasm for backing the deal as it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Irish backstop could be removed or fundamentally altered, then that would be a different kettle of fish.\u201d\nCox arrived in Brussels on Tuesday for talks with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, where he is expected to pressfor legal guarantees that the backstop remains a last resort and temporary option.",

The video, which drew widespread condemnation as a presidential threat to press freedoms, came with the hashtags: \n#FraudNewsCNN \n#FNN.\nThe plaintiff in the case, AT&T, has consistently raised questions over whether the department\u2019s suit was politically motivated, while the justice department denied that politics played any part in its decision to litigate.\nStill, the case against the merger was highly unusual since it marked the first time in four decades that the government had litigated a \u201cvertical\u201d merger \u2013 one that combined two companies that didn\u2019t compete head-to-head and thus could not be accused of creating a monopolistic trading environment.\nInstead, the government argued that an AT&T and Time Warner combination would have the power to force higher pay-TV prices on consumers.\nBut at trial last year, the government struggled to make its case before the US district judge Richard Leon. According to transcripts obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Judge Leon criticized justice department lawyers for introducing irrelevant or repetitive points.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear out your welcome,\u201d Leon said at one point over the six-week trial.\nIn appealing against the ruling, the justice department argued that Judge Leon ignored \u201cfundamental principles of economics and common sense\u201d.\nIn its ruling on Tuesday, the appeals court partially sided with the government, saying Judge Leon had \u201cmade some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore\u201d. But the panel said none of those errors were sufficient to undermine his decision to approve the deal.",

He is expected to face a prison term.\nThe Vatican said the disgraced prelate had \u201creiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree\u201d. In the meantime, a ban on Pell exercising ministry or having contact with minors would remain in place.\nThe cardinal\u2019s five-year term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday, and Pope Francis \u2013 who previously praised Pell for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse \u2013 removed him from his inner council of advisers in December.\nThe outcome of the trial, which was subject to a gagging order until this week, was \u201cpainful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia,\u201d said Alessandro Gisotti, the Vatican press spokesman.\nHe added: \u201cWhile waiting for the final judgment, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all the victims of abuse, reaffirming our commitment to do everything possible so that the church is a safe house for everyone, especially for children and the most vulnerable.\u201d\nThe father of one of the boys assaulted by Pell said the cardinal had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d. The man\u2019s son died of a heroin overdose 17 years after being molested by Pell as a 13-year-old chorister at Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. The man said he planned to sue Pell or the church.\nA mother of another clerical abuse victim, who died of an overdose at the age of 26, said: \u201cThe priesthood must stand condemned for what they have done to children.\u201d\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nChrissie Foster\u2019s daughter Emma disclosed her abuse to Pell when he was archbishop of Melbourne. Pell \u201chad absolutely no sympathy or understanding or anything. He just was angry and jumping down our throats, telling us to prove it in court,\u201d Foster told ABC. \u201cNow I look at it under this verdict that he\u2019s received, and I think, \u2018Oh my goodness, he had a vested interest in shutting us up because he himself was a paedophile as well.\u2019\u201d\nFrancesco Zanardi, who set up Rete l\u2019Abuso, an Italian network of clerical abuse survivors, said: \u201cA strong signal would have been completely removing Pell two years ago [when he first faced charges].\u201d\nJuan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean survivor of clerical sexual abuse, said the outcome of the trial ought to \u201cput bishops and cardinals around the world on notice\u201d.\nThe news of the guilty verdict, which was reached unanimously by a jury in December, came less than 48 hours after an unprecedented summit at the Vatican on clerical sexual abuse that was intended to signal a turning point on an issue that has gravely damaged the church and imperilled Pope Francis\u2019s papacy.\nAlthough the outcome of the trial was already known by senior figures at the Vatican, the verdict is likely to reverberate across the 1.2 billion-strong global church.\nPell\u2019s disgrace had caused a \u201cdeep, deep wound to the entire Catholic church\u201d, said Robert Mickens, the Rome-based editor of the English-language edition of the Catholic daily newspaper La Croix.\n\u201cIt has to be stated that the hierarchy has never done anything on its own,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are still wondering \u2013 is [the church] being totally honest about what has happened and the culpability, especially of bishops?\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: \u201cLike most Australians, I am deeply shocked at the crimes of which George Pell has been convicted. I respect the fact that this case is under appeal, but it is the victims and their families I am thinking of today, and all who have suffered from sexual abuse by those they should have been able to trust, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nProf Des Cahill, a former Catholic priest who has become an advocate for survivors of child abuse, said: \u201cThis is is a momentous event, as part of the continuing drama of the Catholic catastrophe.\u201d\nIf his conviction is upheld, Pell will face a canonical trial, at the end of which he could be removed from the priesthood. Less than two weeks ago, another prominent figure in the church, the former cardinal and archbishop Theodore McCarrick, was defrocked after the Vatican found him guilty of sexual abuse.",

There are many local news reports about children being asked to remove them, or claiming they\u2019ve been abused for wearing one. Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, often encounters an influx of children on school trips in Maga hats, making residents bristle.\nMaddie Mueller, a student at Clovis North high school in Fresno, California, is the latest example. She was prohibited from wearing her Maga hat by teachers, so she\u2019s now suing the school district, claiming she has a first amendment right to wear it.\nSchool officials say they simply don\u2019t allow certain logos as part of the dress code, but Mueller has responded saying, \u201cto my knowledge, Trump is not a logo. It\u2019s a last name. It\u2019s just our president.\n\u201cHow is being a patriot in trying to show pride in your country \u2013 how is that inappropriate?\u201d\nSoon after the story broke, Mueller made an appearance on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show, claiming that the school was discriminating against her because she \u201cchecked today\u201d and saw four Hillary Clinton T-shirts, a Bernie Sanders hat, an Obama shirt and seven LGBTQ rainbow flag hats. Ingraham asked Mueller if these items were worn \u201cin classrooms\u201d and she said yes.\nIngraham said she had no reason to question Mueller\u2019s claim that she saw four students in Clinton hats, two years after the presidential election, or that she had checked to make sure they were still wearing them in class.

It also partly explains the crash in the song thrush population, which relies on this type of worm to feed its young in the spring.\nResearchers asked farmers to dig pits in their fields and count the number of worms of each type they found. The average field had nine per spadeful, but the best fields with healthy soil had three times that number. More than half the farmers were so alarmed by the results they pledged to change their practices.",

The defender will find out on Thursday if he will face an extended suspension.\nThe Real Madrid captain was booked in the 89th minute of Madrid\u2019s 2-1 victory in Amsterdam for a foul on Kasper Dolberg \u2013 his second booking in this year\u2019s competition \u2013 and will miss next week\u2019s second leg at the Bernab\u00e9u, serving his suspension before the team\u2019s likely progress to the quarter-finals.\nSpeaking immediately after the match, Ramos was quoted as saying he \u201cwould be lying\u201d if he were to deny deliberately earning the booking. Ramos later used social media to claim he had not intentionally collected a caution, referring instead to purposefully giving away a free-kick to prevent an Ajax equaliser.\nUefa subsequently launched a disciplinary investigation and confirmed on Tuesday that Ramos had been charged. If found guilty when the case is dealt with by the Uefa Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body, Ramos could receive a further suspension and potentially miss the quarter-finals.\nValencia midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia was recently handed a two-match ban by Uefa for a similar offence. He was ruled to have deliberately received a yellow card during the Europa League first-leg win at Celtic. The midfielder will only miss the first leg of the tie against Krasnodar, however, with the second leg in Glasgow counting towards the ban.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\nIn an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca, Ramos has reiterated his denial of any wrongdoing. \u201cI\u2019m very surprised about all this,\u201d the 32-year-old said. \u201cI was referring to forcing the foul \u2013 a foul that was inevitable \u2013 not to forcing the booking.\u201d\nAsked if he knew the foul was likely to lead to a yellow card and a ban, he added: \u201cYes, but I had no choice. It was a very dangerous counter-attack in the 88th minute. That\u2019s why I said \u2018I would lie if I said I did not know that I was carrying a penalty\u2019, just as I knew that I had no other choice than to make a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant when I said that in football you have to make complicated decisions,\u201d Ramos added. \u201cIf I had wanted to force [a booking], I could have done it in the group stage, in the match against Roma because we had already won the group and the last game against CSKA, was inconsequential.\u201d\nReal Madrid\u2019s 2-0 win at Roma on matchday five ensured they would win Group G regardless of the result against CSKA Moscow in the final group game; Real ultimately lost that game 3-0. Ramos picked up his first booking at home to Roma in the first game of their campaign.\nUefa have also confirmed that disciplinary proceedings have been opened following a complaint made by Tottenham, after the Champions League group game at Barcelona on 11 December.\nBarcelona have been charged with insufficient organisation at the Camp Nou for the match, which ended in a 1-1 draw.

        "content": "Marco Silva had acknowledged that he was in effect on trial as head coach given Everton\u2019s alarming recent slide and, while his side did not exactly pass this test with flying colours, in the end they comfortably ousted Cardiff courtesy of an ice-cool double by Gylfi Sigurdsson and a stoppage-time strike by Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nIt is almost three years since the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, acquired his first stake and, though a first victory in four matches lifts the immediate doom and gloom around Silva, the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Sunday will provide a clearer marker of the progress of a team into which the British-Iranian billionaire has pumped in excess of \u00a3300m.\nThe reality is that Everton have still only beaten Lincoln, Bournemouth, Huddersfield and now Cardiff since the turn of the year. But there were a few encouraging signs here, namely the grace with which Sigurdsson performed throughout. Is the tide turning? \u201cWe hope, we hope,\u201d said Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important game, it was important that we won the game to get that confidence that we need as a team.\n\u201cIt will be a different game at home with our fans [against Liverpool] and we expect a fantastic atmosphere in our stadium to push us on. One of the problems we have had this season was missing some consistency. We had two or three months very, very good and then after some bad results we are losing confidence. We have been up and down many times and it was an important win with a clean sheet.\u201d\nSigurdsson left the field to a standing ovation from the away supporters, though perhaps a little disappointed at failing to register the perfect hat-trick after hitting sweet strikes with his left and right feet. In doing so, he became the leading Icelandic goalscorer in Premier League history, surpassing Eidur Gudjohnsen\u2019s tally of 55.\n\u201cYou are seeing a different Gylfi Sigurdsson this season \u2013 he deserved his goals,\u201d Silva added. \u201cI\u2019m sure next match we will see Gylfi playing with more confidence, apart from his qualities he is always giving everything to the team. This season we have given him a different role.\u201d\nCardiff remain one place and one point above the relegation zone. Their starting lineup consisted of 11 footballers who played in the second tier last season and the side badly lacked bite. \u201cWe had a great opportunity to take the lead and then we made elementary mistakes to concede the goals,\u201d said Neil Warnock. \u201cI know he\u2019s cost \u00a350m but Sigurdsson does not need more than one chance to score, whereas we huffed and puffed around goal. That is the difference, isn\u2019t it? As disappointing as it was, we are not going to throw the towel in now.\u201d\nSilva said victory here was non-negotiable after they had lost eight of their previous 11 league games. Everton travelled to south Wales on the back of a 17-day break from their last match, a defeat to Watford, but did not showcase any noticeable strides made on the training ground until four minutes before the interval. It had the whiff of a simple training-ground move, from an incisive pass by Morgan Schneiderlin \u2013 impressive on his first start since October and one of five changes made by Silva \u2013 to slip in S\u00e9amus Coleman down the right flank, to Sigurdsson\u2019s sweeping finish beyond Neil Etheridge in the Cardiff goal.\nStrangled by expectation in recent weeks, Everton found some refreshing freedom after Sigurdsson\u2019s opener and, when Silva introduced Bernard on the hour mark, they quickly set about doubling their lead.\nIdrissa Gueye, an authoritative figure again in midfield, fed the Brazilian, who drove down the left flank with purpose, forcing Etheridge to palm away. The ball fell at the feet of Sigurdsson, who lashed the ball home with his left foot. By that point, Cardiff supporters had seen enough, though Everton were not finished, with Calvert-Lewin striking as any clouds hovering over Silva evaporated.",

        "content": "With the Claude Puel cloud lifted, here comes the reign of Brendan Rodgers. Leicester\u2019s manager ran the rule over his new charges as they secured their first home win since Boxing Day thanks to goals by Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy.\nDavy Pr\u00f6pper pulled one back but, if Leicester are looking up again, Brighton cannot be comfortable about being only three points above Southampton, who occupy 18th place.\nWhile it would be easy to claim Leicester were inspired by Rodgers\u2019s presence, gifts from Brighton were a major factor. Chris Hughton\u2019s side started limply and, after rallying, finished badly, with Glen Murray guilty of two uncharacteristic misses.\nStill, there is no doubt the arrival of Rodgers has raised the mood at Leicester. He watched from the directors\u2019 box from where he beamed and waved when given a rapturous greeting from the crowd before the kick-off.\nApparently the players are similarly enthused by his appointment. \u201cHe came into the dressing room after the game and he was very positive,\u201d said Mike Stowell, who, along with Adam Sadler, was in temporary charge for this match. \u201cThe lads were in awe listening to him,\u201d Stowell continued. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve only left Celtic to come here for one reason and that\u2019s to work with this group of players.\u2019 That speaks volumes for this young group.\u201d\nHarry Maguire said: \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for the club. We all know his profile and what he\u2019s done. We\u2019re all looking forward to working with him. Celtic are a massive club, so it shows how big Leicester are getting and our ambitions.\u201d\nLeicester\u2019s ambition before taking on Brighton was to end a series of four straight defeats. Having spoken of his desire to create a \u201creally aggressive\u201d side, Rodgers must have appreciated the way the hosts got stuck in. Then again, they could hardly have asked for more obliging visitors, as Brighton began with a timidity that showed why they are among the Premier League\u2019s worst travellers, without an away win since a narrow victory at Huddersfield in early December.\nScoring the opening goal, which Leicester repeatedly failed to do under Puel, was an ideal way to greet a new dawn. Vardy, one of the player\u2019s hoping to benefit most from Puel\u2019s departure, had a chance to land the first blow when James Maddison pulled the ball back to him in the fifth minute but Shane Duffy threw himself in front of the striker\u2019s shot from the edge of the six-yard box.\nLeicester were not denied, merely delayed. Five minutes later they made the breakthrough thanks to Gray. Hughton must have been aghast at how feebly his team defended after Harvey Barnes dispossessed Anthony Knockaert near halfway. Youri Tielemans ran free from midfield before slipping a pass through to Gray, who was free to fire low into the net from 15 yards.\nHe nearly doubled his tally four minutes later after Barnes again made gains down the left. Mat Ryan got down well to save.\nAs Brighton pulled themselves together, Leicester became a little dishevelled. Kasper Schmeichel made two important saves, first from Pascal Gross and then an excellent one-handed stop to thwart Knockaert.\nLeicester should have been punished early in the second half when Maddison was caught in possession but, after a lovely move involving Knockaert and a back\u2011heeled pass by Gross, Murray lifted the ball over from eight yards. Worse, Gross suffered a hamstring injury when performing his nifty tee-up.\nMoments later Leicester eased their anxiety with a classy goal. Advancing nimbly from midfield they cut through Brighton, Vardy applying the finish by running on to a clever pass by Maddison and ramming the ball past Ryan from 10 yards.\nLeicester were not comfortable for long. Three minutes later Pr\u00f6pper cut their lead in half, firing low into the net from edge of the box after Knockaert\u2019s cross from the right was deflected into his path by Ben Chilwell.\nBarnes had a brilliant game on the left wing but missed two decent chances on the counterattack. Brighton\u2019s best chance to equalise fell to Murray in the 87th minute but the normally trusty striker again misfired, blasting wide from seven yards.\n\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re not putting away opportunities and so we have to make sure we\u2019re not conceding,\u201d Hughton said. \u201cThose small margins are not going for us at the moment and it\u2019s only us that can do something about it.\u201d\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels",

        "content": "At last Huddersfield have lift-off. Not from the foot of the table, naturally, but a first win in three months and the first points gained since David Wagner\u2019s departure were secured through a stoppage-time goal from Steve Mouni\u00e9, just as a forgettable game seemed to be drifting towards a scoreless draw.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud,\u201d Jan Siewert said. \u201cThe players deserved it so much because you couldn\u2019t believe how they have suffered in recent weeks, they have been so unlucky but still they work and fight.\u201d\nThe victory takes Huddersfield to 14 points, still an unlikely platform for survival but at least they will now avoid the ignominy of sharing the record low of 11 set by Derby in 2007-08. Plus the Terriers can hold their heads high in the company of Wolves, who may be on the fringes of Europe but have somehow been responsible for donating six points to the Huddersfield cause. \u201cIt was not one of our best performances,\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create enough and we need to work harder.\u201d\nIndeed, an evening low on quality and incident barely deserved its rousing finale. While Huddersfield have appeared resigned to their fate for some time, Wolves were unusually tepid, hardly managing an attempt at goal let alone a shot on target.\nThe home side were predictably lacking in that respect, too, but when the substitute Aaron Mooy launched one last attack with a cross from the right, Willy Boly\u2019s deflection allowed Karlan Grant to shoot at Rui Patr\u00edcio. The goalkeeper saved with his legs but even though Mouni\u00e9 was on his knees he was still able to sweep the loose ball over the line.\nAfter losing all four matches of his tenure to date Siewert had decided it was time for drastic action, with no fewer than eight of the side who lost against Newcastle at the weekend dropping out of the starting lineup. Initially the effect was oddly the same. Huddersfield continued to pass the ball around crisply and confidently in midfield, as they have done all season, without offering anything remotely threatening in the final third.\nWolves were guilty of much the same thing though they squandered a great chance to go ahead when Diogo Jota made his way to the goalline and crossed to Matt Doherty at the far post, who had a clear sight of goal but appeared not to be expecting the ball.\nSadly that was just about the highlight of the first half until Alex Pritchard produced a clever cross for Grant to acrobatically slice wide. Huddersfield deserved something from the attack since Jon Stankovic\u2019s spirited attempt to set up a length-of-the-field breakaway from a Wolves corner had been cynically halted on the edge of the visitors\u2019 area by the chasing Ryan Bennett. The referee allowed play to continue while Huddersfield had the ball in a dangerous area, though once Grant had failed to take advantage he booked the Wolves defender.\nThose mild frissons of excitement apart, the most memorable aspect of a disappointing first half had been the two sets of supporters winding each other up. When the travelling fans chanted about the possibility of Town going down the home fans hit back with a reminder that their last league victory, way back in November, had come at Molineux. \u201cHow crap must you be, we beat you two-nil.\u201d\nThe second half opened more promisingly, with Boly getting in the way of a goal-bound shot from Mouni\u00e9 and Stankovic having a header saved by Patr\u00edcio from the resulting corner. At the other end Jonas L\u00f6ssl came out to save at the feet of Jota after he had been played through by Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. A clear chance arrived just before the hour when a Juninho Bacuna cross eluded Terence Kongolo in the area but sat up nicely at the far post for Mouni\u00e9, who could only find the side-netting with a close-range header.\nMooy went close when he came on for the last few minutes then Mouni\u00e9 curled a shot inches wide of a post with four minutes remaining. The crowd gasped in real time and groaned anew at the replay on the big screen. That\u2019s the sort of season it has been at Huddersfield, but there was still time for a last-gasp winner.\n\u201cI might have one or two beers now,\u201d Siewert said. \u201cBut then it\u2019s back to working and fighting.\u201d",

After in effect securing their Premier League status courtesy of three straight wins following last year\u2019s mini-break, Newcastle have returned from their latest visit to the Costa Blanca and promptly taken six vital points, from Huddersfield and now Burnley.\nWhile goals from Fabian Sch\u00e4r \u2013 with an outstanding strike \u2013 and the excellent Sean Longstaff lifted Newcastle into the sunlit uplands of 13th place they also reminded Sean Dyche that all good things must come to an end.\nBurnley\u2019s manager had never previously lost a Premier League match on a Tuesday and his team arrived unbeaten in the league in 2019 and on a run of eight league games without defeat, their best top-tier run for 53 years. \u201cCredit to Newcastle, they were better than us,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cThey deserved to win.\u201d\nBen\u00edtez was delighted by his side\u2019s ability in the face of Burnley\u2019s physicality. \u201cThere were a lot of positives,\u201d said a manager whose demeanour hints he may extend a contract that expires in May. \u201cWe trained really hard in Spain and I was confident we could finish stronger. Now we have to be confident we have a project and ambition to be a top Premier League side. We can do it.\u201d\nAlthough configured in a fluidly attacking 3-4-3 formation Newcastle started slowly. Bar one gorgeous raking diagonal pass from Longstaff \u2013 a young midfielder set to be called up to the England Under-21s before possibly joining the fast track to Gareth Southgate\u2019s seniors \u2013 and a first-time Matt Ritchie cross that narrowly failed to find Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, the hosts created little of note.\nOr at least not until the 24th minute. With a single swipe of his foot, Sch\u00e4r changed the game. After collecting the ball from Javier Manquillo the central defender found himself around 30 yards out and took aim. The resultant angled shot swerved wickedly away from Tom Heaton, the visiting goalkeeper helpless as it came off the inside of a post before dropping into the net. Even Dyche seemed nonplussed.\nBurnley\u2019s manager had cut a vocal, demonstrative presence in the technical area but his game plan was soon to go further awry as Longstaff scored his first senior goal. It arrived courtesy of a fabulous cross from Ritchie \u2013 outstanding at left wing-back \u2013 with which Rond\u00f3n could not quite connect, leaving the ball to drop for the academy graduate from North Shields. All that remained was for Longstaff to swivel smartly before driving an angled volley into the bottom corner.\nAs he was serenaded with \u201cone of our own\u201d choruses, Dyche complained about Craig Pawson\u2019s failure to award his side a free-kick for what he saw to be a foul on Jack Cork in the buildup.\nWith Burnley\u2019s recently dependable defence increasingly destabilised by Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s searing change of pace and the energy of the unwell Ashley Westwood much missed in their midfield, the visitors\u2019 unbeaten run looked in severe jeopardy. Even so they could and should have reduced the deficit as half-time neared when the ball fell kindly for James Tarkowski about six yards out. Showing why he is a centre-half rather than a centre-forward, he volleyed wildly off-target.\nDwight McNeil has been a key figure in Burnley\u2019s recent renaissance but struggled here and was replaced on the left of midfield by Robbie Brady at the interval. Dyche\u2019s players subsequently improved slightly but not sufficiently and could have fallen further behind when Heaton saved smartly from Almir\u00f3n with his legs.\nBurnley\u2019s manager replaced the well-marshalled Ashley Barnes with Peter Crouch but the incoming striker\u2019s most notable achievements were to collect a booking for catching Sch\u00e4r on a shin and then leaving Mo Diam\u00e9 with a bandaged head after accidentally elbowing him above an eye.\n\u201cSome of our quality was lacking,\u201d said Dyche, whose side are 15th and remain within touching distance of safety. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be back.\u201d",

He said the matches were akin to cup finals.\nYet on both occasions, Spurs lacked fight and intensity, they slipped to 2-1 defeats and Pochettino was left to find a target for his anger. After losing to Watford he hammered his players in the press conference while after Burnley he confronted the referee, Mike Dean, incurring an improper conduct charge from the FA.\nPochettino did not mention it but Spurs\u2019s 3-1 home defeat by Wolves on 29 December fitted the same pattern. Had Spurs won that day they would have moved, for a few hours at least, to within three points of the leaders, Liverpool. They are currently six points off Liverpool\u2019s pace.\n\u201cI am only so surprised that we cannot build the feeling that the game is going to be the most important game,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIs that what is holding us back? Yes, exactly. My worry is what happened [against Watford and Burnley] and to change that is not only five years\u2019 work, maybe it is 10 years\u2019 work to change that thing that happened here.\u201d\nPochettino said he had a full and frank discussion with his players after the Burnley game and, listening to him on Tuesday, it was not difficult to imagine what he told them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to go to Chelsea and be motivated or to play against Arsenal [on Saturday] or Dortmund [next Tuesday],\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a manager that tells you: \u2018Oh, you need to be motivated.\u2019 But you play for the Premier League in games like Burnley.\n\u201cThe pitch is dry? It\u2019s normal because the weather is dry. The changing room is not so big like Wembley? Of course it\u2019s not. But come on. You need to respect and the way you need to respect is to go there and show more ambition, attitude and capacity to fight. We are not. If we don\u2019t have the will to show that, we don\u2019t deserve more.\nManchester City (86 points)\n24 Apr Man Utd (a)28 Apr\u00a0Burnley (a)4 May\u00a0Leicester (h)12 May\u00a0Brighton (a)\nLiverpool (85 points)\n21 Apr\u00a0Cardiff (a)\u00a026 Apr\u00a0Huddersfield (h)5 May\u00a0Newcastle (a)\u00a012 May\u00a0Wolves (h)\n\u201cI am so frustrated because we didn\u2019t show more attitude than Burnley or energy or ambition, and we were fighting for the Premier League. We showed we are a good team, with good quality, but it\u2019s not enough. To be a real contender, this type of game is must-win. It\u2019s unacceptable to lose.\u201d\nPochettino has apologised to Dean and will not contest the FA charge, which, because it is non-standard, will be heard by an independent commission. Spurs have until 6pm on Thursday to officially respond and the suspicion is they will wait until the last moment as they do not want to risk the punishment being processed before the visit of Arsenal. There is no set sanction, meaning Pochettino could be given a touchline ban.",

But title pursuits rarely run smooth, insisted Klopp, who believes the experience will benefit everyone at Anfield regardless of how the campaign finishes.\n\u201cObviously a lot of Liverpool teams before us tried to be champion and it didn\u2019t work out so it was always the manager or the team or other stuff like that,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThere is always a moment when, if we are not 25 points ahead, a season gets tricky. Always. Leicester had that. Chelsea had it. Only City last year didn\u2019t really have it. Winning 5-0 against us with 10 men [when Sadio Man\u00e9 was sent off at 1-0] changed the season for them. Apart from that it always happens.\n\u201cOne generation has to break through, to make it happen, and then for the rest it will be easier. It would be nice if we could be that. The development of this team is unbelievable. Not that I praise myself or whatever, but it is unbelievable. We played three finals. I know in the world outside it looks like finals are nice, all perfect, then you don\u2019t win and nobody thinks about it, but I don\u2019t know a lot of teams that have been in three finals in the last three years. We improve constantly in the table.\n\u201cWe are in a good moment. I cannot help if you don\u2019t see it. We know about our responsibility and we go for it with all we have. This is not our last chance \u2013 that\u2019s a very important thing. This is our first chance. There\u2019s a massive difference. With the first chance, you jump in, then see if it works out. Sometimes it does, sometimes not. This will not be our last chance, 100% not.\u201d\nKlopp maintained he is \u201chappy with a lot of moments\u201d in this calendar year and the scrutiny placed on Liverpool is more intense than that on their title rivals. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s like you get an eye problem when you have to watch our football now compared to when we played such wonderful football a few weeks ago. Sorry for that disappointment. It is the job to do.\n\u201cDo other teams perform constantly? They don\u2019t. Sometimes they have the result but we don\u2019t look at them in detail, we just see they are winning. You only have this obsessed look on our football. Yes, there were moments when I wish we would fly a bit more but you don\u2019t fly because you want to fly.

Yet Sarri, who goes into the Spurs match clinging to his position after recent damaging results, gave Arrizabalaga no guarantees he would retain his place and praised the goalkeeper\u2019s deputy, Willy Caballero, as \u201ca reference point in the dressing room\u201d.\nSarri said he would have to decide if Arrizabalaga started against Spurs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe yes. Maybe no. I think he is fit. It will be a decision for the [good of the] group. For the other players, all the players. I have to decide for my group. I want to send a message: the message could be Kepa is on the pitch, or Kepa is out the pitch. I have to decide what is better.\n\u201cHe has to [be ready to play if required]. He made a mistake. A big mistake. There are some consequences. If the consequence is to play, he has to be ready to play. If the consequence is the bench, he has to be ready to go to the bench.\u201d\nOn Caballero, who has a reputation as a penalty specialist and would have been seeking to thwart former clubmates had he come on against City, Sarri said: \u201cI think Willy is a very good goalkeeper and he\u2019s a great man. He is a point of reference in the dressing room for his personality, for his behaviour, for everything. So I think he has the maturity to be ready for everything.\u201d\nSarri, who usually reveals Chelsea\u2019s team selection relatively close to kick-off, was so incensed by Arrizabalaga\u2019s conduct that when told by the referee the final was to continue without the substitution, he stormed down the tunnel.\nThe manager returned moments later having composed himself but had to be restrained by Antonio R\u00fcdiger from confronting the goalkeeper as Chelsea\u2019s players prepared for the shootout. Sarri was also involved in what appeared to be a heated discussion with the Chelsea captain, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, who would score his spot-kick shortly after.\nYet Sarri denied his anger had disrupted preparations for the shootout. \u201cI needed a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really upset and I needed to return calm and in control of my mind. When the match started again, I was on the bench. And I still spoke with the players [before the shootout], very briefly, because we had only to kick penalties, so I have to say five names. Not tactics.\u201d\nSarri put the failure of senior players other than David Luiz to speak to Arrizabalaga at the time down to the \u201cvery unusual situation\u201d that had left them, like the manager, \u201cvery shocked\u201d.\nDefeat by Spurs could leave Chelsea six points behind the top four and have serious implications for Sarri. Memories of the home support\u2019s angry dismissal of his tactics during last week\u2019s FA Cup defeat by Manchester United are still fresh and the manager, while empathising with the fans\u2019 discontent, urged the crowd to show \u201cmore support for my players, and not for me\u201d.\n\u201cThe goalkeeper is not a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe made a big mistake but he is really a very nice boy. There is only one difficulty: the results. The atmosphere in the training ground is really very good. The application of the players is better than before. The problem is to have results with consistency.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to play with the same level of application as in the last match because, mentally, we spent a lot in the match on Sunday.\u201d",

When he was injured in December, City suffered two of their four league defeats, at home to Crystal Palace and at Leicester. Laporte, meanwhile, is City\u2019s best defender.\nEach has a muscle injury picked up in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final win over Chelsea and Guardiola said: \u201cWe were already without John Stones and Gabriel Jesus. Now it\u2019s Dinho and Aymer. Hopefully after the international break they will return. I think John and Gabriel are coming back soon. The other two, hopefully the Swansea game, or after the international break.\u201d\nThe first match after the break is at Fulham on 30 March. In the meantime City face West Ham, Bournemouth and Watford in the league, and play the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Schalke, plus an FA Cup quarter-final at Swansea.\nRegarding who might be able to replace Fernandinho as the holding player Guardiola said: \u201cDanilo can play there, we can play Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Fabian Delph and I think Oleks Zinchenko can play in that position, too. So we can play with two players. Kevin De Bruyne can play there. We\u2019re going to find the right decision that hopefully works. Dani played for Santos in that position, so he knows a little bit.\u201d\nThe manager has told his players he will not tolerate any attempt to find pretexts for failure in the remaining 11 games of City\u2019s title defence. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see excuses about tiredness, fixtures, schedules or how many games,\u201d Guardiola said as he prepared for Wednesday\u2019s home game against West Ham.\n\u201cThat is nothing. When you have the dream to fight until the end, to retain the title, the power and the energy to give you that, it is higher than any excuses you can find.\n\u201cWe have to run and beat them, and after that beat them again. In the last two months mentality makes the difference. People say about this player or the other one. It doesn\u2019t matter [who plays].

I don\u2019t care about the way we want to play or the other things. I want the smell in the locker room. I want to smell in the beginning of the game, during the game, with our fans, now when one competition is over, really we want to win this title. I want to see their faces tomorrow.

The situation became so bad, she said, that her father began sleeping on the floor in a communal area as he was too terrified to stay in his room.\nHer father, a former university lecturer in his 70s who can no longer speak properly, was living at Ensham House in Wandsworth, south London for 18 months until late last year. The facility provides 24-hour care for people aged 55 and over living in 45 individual flats.\nThe most recent inspection by the Care Quality Commission rated the facility as \u201cgood\u201d. But Allin-Khan said neither Wandsworth council or London Care, which is contracted by the local authority to look after people staying there, had provided an adequate explanation for the situation. She said she and her family felt as if they were being put \u201con trial\u201d when raising concerns.\nShe even claimed the director of adult social services at Wandsworth council, Liz Bruce, last week refused to look at photos of her father\u2019s injuries and declared the dementia sufferer had sustained them because he \u201chad asked for it\u201d. Bruce has been contacted for comment.\nAllin-Khan told the Commons it took three days before a carer alerted her that her father had first been injured. \u201cHe was found extremely distressed by a carer, covered in bloody injuries,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTo our horror, we were told he had not left the building overnight, there was no evidence of him having fallen and no other resident had any evidence of injury. Quite unexpectedly, the centre manager suddenly left and not a single person had any excuse as to what had happened or why we were not called.\u201cIn the following months, we found my father bruised again with no answers on two further occasions \u2026 we were incredibly concerned, and this is when they started to attempt to claim, that despite a year of living there with no issues towards him, my father was being \u2018difficult\u2019.\n\u201cThis was not corroborated by his community psychiatric team, [nor] any of the day centre staff where he spent up to 25 hours per week.\u201d\nWhen her father was admitted to hospital for a routine issue, he was served an eviction notice detailing a list of allegations against him with \u201cno evidence\u201d, the MP said, adding: \u201cHow heartless, an eviction notice while in hospital.\u201d\nAllin-Khan, who said the care facility had five separate managers in as many months, said: \u201cThe point of no return was when we found my father unconscious on the floor with blood on the walls and the floor and the carer\u2019s set of keys left next to him. Following this, he spent one month in hospital.\u201d\nHer father has since been moved to another care facility. The MP, who works at St George\u2019s hospital in her south London seat of Tooting, said: \u201cWe must give our vulnerable a fair chance at ageing safely and gracefully and their voices must be heard.\u201d\nThe Metropolitan police, which investigated the injuries sustained by the MP\u2019s father, said: \u201cDespite extensive enquiries, it was not possible to confirm whether or not the man had been assaulted.\u201d\nLondon Care Ltd made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3723,000 in 2018, up from \u00a3626,000 in 2017, according to Companies House. A spokesman said: \u201cDr Allin-Khan\u2019s father had complex care needs and we were already aware of concerns about his tenancy at Ensham House Extra Care scheme, at which London Care provides care services. However, we have no reason to believe that London Care failed in its duty of care in this case and our view is supported by the findings of the local authority\u2019s own safeguarding investigation.\u201d\nA Wandsworth council spokesman said: \u201cWe have been in dialogue with Rosena Allin-Khan MP about her father for some time, and are aware of her concerns. Although she makes some important points related to wider public policy, in the investigations to date we have not been able to validate her specific complaint about her father\u2019s care.\u201d\nA council spokesman added: \u201cLiz Bruce is one of the most experienced directors of adult social services in the country and has been a director for more than ten years.\n\u201cPrior to her current role she was director of adult social services at Manchester City Council and after that carried out the same position at three London boroughs. She cares very much for vulnerable adults and leads a department which demands high standards when it comes to safeguarding arrangements, taking our safeguarding duties very seriously.\n\u201cShe has personally been involved in this case in which she has deep empathy, working closely with the MP and her family. The council has strong confidence in the professionalism of her and her staff.\u201d\n This footnote was added on 4 March 2019. After publication, Wandsworth Council issued a statement to say that Liz Bruce did not use the words \u201che had asked for it\u201d about Rosena Allin-Khan\u2019s father.",

        "content": "When rainbow flags were ripped down and destroyed before a Pride Cup game in 2016, wheels of change were set in motion\nDavid Kyle says he has become an ally and advocate of Pride Cups almost by default. As president of the North Gippsland Football League in country Victoria, Kyle says he became motivated to become a more vocal advocate for LGBTI inclusion when he witnessed what he took to be a homophobic response to the club\u2019s first Pride Cup match in 2016 between local teams Glengarry and Traralgon Tyres United.\nWhen Dean Sutton\u00a0\u2013 a local LGBTI community member working with the league on the Pride Cup \u2013\u00a0hung rainbow flags in the main street of the the tiny town of Glengarry, the flags were torn down and destroyed just hours later.\n\u201cSeeing that negative response was probably the catalyst that made us realise we needed to keep moving forward with our inclusion policies, take more of a stand, and start the eduction process,\u201d Kyle says. \u201cThe support mechanisms or acceptance down here are not the same as Collins Street in Melbourne \u2013 so we needed to deal with some very old and long held cultural views.\u201d\nThis week, in a broad ranging push for LGBTI inclusion in sport, CEOs of several Victorian sporting organisations \u2013 including Australian rules football, tennis, rugby, cricket, football, netball and gymnastics \u2013 made a \u201cpledge of pride\u201d, welcoming members into clubs regardless of sexuality or gender identity.\nThe CEOs from across the full gamut of sporting codes expressed a common sentiment that their sports should be open to all Australians and that sexuality and gender should never be a roadblock.\n\u201cHockey Victoria and our community has been a strong advocate for celebrating sexual and gender diversity for close to a decade,\u201d says Hockey Victoria CEO Andrew Skillern. \u201cThe collaboration with other codes is vital to ensure we all show what can be done by celebrating diversity together.\u201d\nA recent Out on the Fields study found that 80% of Australians have experienced or witnessed homophobia in sport, including slurs such as \u201cfaggot\u201d or \u201cdyke\u201d; 75% believe openly gay spectators would not be safe at a sporting event, and 87% of young gay men and 75% of young gay women remain in the closet while playing sport.\nSince the first Pride Cup was held in Yarra Glen in 2014, there are now more than 30 sporting clubs registered to stage their own versions. The movement formed after former Yarra Glen football club player Jason Ball came out as gay in 2012, spearheading a national campaign to tackle homophobia in sport, culminating in the founding of Pride Cup Australia.\nPride Cup Australia and VicHealth also launched a new handbook this week as a resource offering case-studies, tips and real-life scenarios for local and national sporting organisations to create successful, inclusive and meaningful Pride Cups in their communities.\n\u201cThe handbook is about meeting the demand we have had from sporting clubs who want to bring Pride Cup to their communities, based on the 14 or so Pride Cups that have been held across the state over the last five years,\u201d says Ball.\n\u201cWe have had a massive increase in the number of clubs wanting to sign up with Pride Cup \u2013 but we need to make sure they understand that Pride Cup is not just a token adding of the rainbow to a sporting match.\u201d\nBall says the handbook includes all the collective wisdom learnt from putting on Pride Cups to date to ensure they are staged appropriately. \u201cIt needs to be done in a meaningful way that includes education for players and coaches that helps them challenge homophobia, and includes working with local LGBTI organisations in their communities.\u201d\nAccording to Kyle, there are definitely signs of progress since his league started hosting events in 2016, but there is still a long way to go. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we have totally got to where we want to get with this yet,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut I have had parents and young people calling me and thanking us for the work we are doing in this space. I still think we have a long to travel but I do think its making a difference to people\u2019s lives. And if that\u2019s the only result we get out of this, I still think that\u2019s a pretty good result.\u201d",

        "content": "Democrats, joined by 13 Republicans, passed the measure killing the president\u2019s border wall order; it now moves to a Senate vote\nThe Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has advanced a resolution to terminate Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration at the US-Mexico border, in an attempt to block the president from beginning construction on a border wall without approval from Congress.\nIn a vote of 245-182, the House easily passed the measure.\nThirteen Republicans joined Democrats in moving to revoke Trump\u2019s executive order, which he signed earlier this month after US lawmakers refused to authorize his request for $5.7bn in funding toward a border wall during negotiations on government spending.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the border,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said. \u201cThis is about the constitution.\u201d\nThe resolution will now face a vote in the Republican-led Senate, where only a handful of defections are needed for it to pass in what would mark a major rebuke of the president. Trump has vowed to veto the measure if it reaches his desk.\nAt least one key Senate Republican, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said she would support the resolution to block Trump\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\u201cI have been concerned, whenever any president, Republican or Democrat, moves beyond what most would consider to be their authorities,\u201d she said.\nTwo other Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, are expected to vote against Trump\u2019s order.\nSeveral other Republicans were critical of Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency, arguing it set a dangerous precedent that challenged Congress\u2019s power of the purse. But it remained unclear if enough Republicans, who have been reticent to take on the president, would be willing to issue a direct challenge of his authority.\nAlthough they expected some to break ranks and join Democrats in supporting the resolution, Republican leaders said they did not anticipate the measure would earn a veto-proof majority.\nPelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill that the issue was not about partisanship, but a question of \u201cpatriotism\u201d.\n\u201cWe would be delinquent in our duties if we did not resist, if we did not fight back to overturn the president\u2019s declaration,\u201d she said.\nTrump\u2019s emergency declaration has separately been hit with several lawsuits, including one filed last week by the attorneys general of 16 states. At the center of most of the legal arguments is the president\u2019s move to circumvent Congress and reallocate funding toward a border wall against the will of federal lawmakers.\nThe concerns were echoed by 58 former national security officials, who released an open letter on Monday denouncing Trump\u2019s declaration.\n\u201cUnder no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border,\u201d the officials wrote.\nThe signatories included former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, who served in Barack Obama\u2019s administration, as well as Eliot Cohen, the state department counselor under George W Bush, and George HW Bush\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering.\nTrump meanwhile urged members of his party to hold the line, tweeting on Monday: \u201cI hope our great Republican senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective border security.\u201d\n\u201cWithout strong borders, we don\u2019t have a country \u2013 and the voters are on board with us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBe strong and smart, don\u2019t fall into the Democrats\u2019 \u2018trap\u2019 of open borders and crime!\u201d\nI hope our great Republican Senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don\u2019t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don\u2019t fall into the Democrats \u201ctrap\u201d of Open Borders and Crime!\nFew promises are as symbolic of Trump\u2019s agenda as building a wall along the south-west US border. Despite his longtime insistence that Mexico would pay for the wall, Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to fund the project and in December led the country into a 35-day shutdown when Democrats rebuffed his demands.\nThe shutdown \u2013 which marked the third of Trump\u2019s presidency and the longest in US history \u2013 ended with the president receiving zero funding for a border wall. Earlier this month, Congress passed a spending bill that allocated nearly $1.4bn toward the construction of a physical barrier but was well short of the $5.7bn Trump had requested.",

        "content": "Sometimes you don\u2019t realise a way of life is gone until you get a taste of it in another place\nWe sat on the grass and spread out a picnic rug. There were hundreds of other people in the park, all ages, doing the same. It was a balmy night in North Fremantle. A seven-piece Indigenous band from Broome, the Pigram Brothers, were playing their annual concert.\nBefore the concert we had done very ordinary things, but at the time they felt illicit. We went to the bottle shop and got a six-pack of beer and a can of premixed gin and tonic. We then went to the fish-and-chip shop and ordered flake and chips.\nWhen we entered the park at twilight, though, there were no barrier gates, bag checks or security guards in high-vis. Drinking the beer from glass while watching live music and eating food that we had brought in ourselves seemed like a scene from a more idyllic, regulation-lite past. But that evening was also tinged with a strange kind of anxiety, as if we were doing something wrong and at any moment a security guard could approach us, confiscate the beers and throw out the food.\nI had been socialising in Sydney far too long and had become accustomed to the new order. This new order involved maximum incursion into what should be a simple process of eating, drinking and watching music. The queues and bag checks; police and sniffer dogs; alcohol or other drinks confiscated; no bringing in your own food; 1.30am lockouts and 3am last drinks (although curiously this law does not apply to Sydney\u2019s casino), and no shots after midnight.\nBut it\u2019s more than just overregulation that\u2019s occurring in Sydney. It\u2019s the corporatisation of fun and community. A whole capitalist enterprise overlays an event as simple as listening to music played outdoors. Banning BYO everything, setting up a high fence and heavily policing the perimeter effectively locks in punters into an economic ecosystem. If you want to eat and drink, you\u2019re forced to line up with everyone else to get something soggy from a food van and a measly measure of wine from a plastic cup at non-competitive, massively inflated prices.\nSometimes you only know that a certain way of life is gone when you get a taste of it in another place. Like when you see a brass band marching in formation through the streets of New Orleans and realise you\u2019d need a licence for that in Melbourne. Or when you drink wine and eat cheese at a park in Paris and don\u2019t have to hide behind a tree.\nAt the concert in Fremantle, there was no one selling anything. How nice it was to unwrap the fish from its paper, steaming and fresh from the shop, and sit around sharing the extra chips with those around us.\nWe watched the sun set over the Swan River behind the stage and, when the show wrapped up a little after 9pm (following a group singalong to From Little Things Big Things Grow), people packed up and left the park in what can only be described as an orderly fashion.\nIt wasn\u2019t simply nostalgia that I felt in Fremantle that night, but a sadness that these types of events feel so rare in Melbourne or Sydney now. It\u2019s the sadness that comes from realising that fun, entertainment and community gatherings have moved so completely into a regulated, neoliberal space.\nIt\u2019s realising that the culture you\u2019re participating in restricts what you can and cannot do, simply to make as much money from you as possible.\nPeople are starting to get sick of it, and clearly still feel a desire for that sense of community that forms around gigs, parties, nightlife and clubbing. I spoke to Tyson Koh, a candidate for the New South Wales upper house for the newly formed Keep Sydney Open party. He\u2019s part of the groundswell of opposition to the increasing policing of culture \u2013 and that includes festivals being shut down because of the onerous costs of policing events, and pubs no longer supporting live music. Koh told me the events in Sydney to which you can bring your own food and drink are now operating underground, but there\u2019s \u201crarely an incident\u201d at them.\nBut it\u2019s not just about the money or the regulation. There\u2019s a rise in loneliness and atomisation among young people, and I wonder if a factor in this is the way that governments have made it expensive, stressful and difficult to go out. It\u2019s easier to stay at home and socialise online. But as we now know the cumulative effects of this can be disastrous, with \u201clonely millennials [more] likely to have mental health problems, be out of work and feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than their peers who feel connected to others\u201d.\nBarbara Ehrenreich\u2019s 2006 book Dancing in the Streets argues that the human desire for collective joy comes from the need to have moments of \u201cletting go\u201d as well as communal bonding. It should be read as a companion to Naomi Klein\u2019s game-changing book from seven years earlier, No Logo, which charts how street and community culture became commodified.\nFor as long as society has existed, ceremonies, festivals and parties have been woven into our lives. We need them. When you share art and culture with others in public places without fear, over-policing, regulations or being priced out, then something magical happens. That\u2019s where true community forms. Can we really afford to give this up without a fight?\n Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",

        "content": "The second volume of his Book of Dust trilogy finds Lyra now a student, facing adult problems as she travels across Europe and into Asia\nSeven years after readers last saw Lyra Silvertongue, sitting on a bench in Oxford\u2019s Botanic Garden, Philip Pullman\u2019s most beloved heroine is set to return as an adult this autumn in the second volume of his trilogy The Book of Dust.\nPullman announced on Wednesday that The Secret Commonwealth would be published in October, just ahead of BBC One\u2019s TV adaptation of his bestselling His Dark Materials trilogy, starring Dafne Keen as the child Lyra, Ruth Wilson as the sinister Mrs Coulter and James McAvoy as Lord Asriel.\nThe first Book of Dust novel, La Belle Sauvage, introduces Lyra as a baby, as a huge flood hits Oxford and the 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead becomes her protector. The Secret Commonwealth is set 20 years after those events, and seven years after the end of The Amber Spyglass, the concluding volume in the His Dark Materials trilogy.\nLyra is no longer a child and life, warned Pullman, is not easy for this grownup version of a character readers first met as an 11-year-old running wild in Oxford with her daemon Pantalaimon. Now a student, she will travel across Europe and into Asia as she searches for a town said to be haunted by daemons.\n\u201cThings have been biding their time, waiting for the right moment to reveal their consequences for Lyra Silvertongue,\u201d said the novelist. \u201cThe Secret Commonwealth tells the continuing story of the impact on Lyra\u2019s life of the search for, and the fear of, Dust. I found it intriguing and deeply exciting to discover how great events can turn on a little moment, and how revenge can be nurtured and fed and watered till it grows beyond control.\u201d\nAn early extract shows conflict between Lyra and Pan, as the daemon criticises her for being pessimistic. \u201cYou used to be optimistic. You used to think that whatever we did would turn out well. Even after we came back from the north, you used to think that. Now you\u2019re cautious, you\u2019re anxious,\u201d he tells her, as the pair deliberate what to do after witnessing a murder. Lyra \u201cknew he was right, but it wasn\u2019t right that he should speak to her accusingly, as if it was something to blame her for. \u2018I used to be young,\u2019 was all she could find to say,\u201d writes Pullman.\n\u201cIt was enthralling for me to remember how powerfully and passionately our minds and opinions can be turned by reading a particular book at the right time. Lyra, as a student, is finding that out. She is also discovering a new and difficult aspect to her relationship with Pantalaimon, and other things about daemons that she never suspected,\u201d said the novelist.\nBut, really, Pullman continued, \u201cthose things are background\u201d. \u201cAt the heart of the book are Lyra, the young woman we saw first as a girl of 12 and then as a baby, and Malcolm, whose life as a boy became involved with hers and who now finds their lives helplessly entangled again; and how some emotions can last a lifetime, and others change beyond recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of some people we know, and others we\u2019ll meet for the first time. Their journey is going to take them far from their homeland towards a mysterious desert in central Asia, where they hope to find, at last, the secret of Dust.\u201d\nThe Secret Commonwealth will be published by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House UK on 3 October. The publisher called it \u201ca timely exploration of what it is to be human, to grow up and make sense of the world around us, from one of the UK\u2019s greatest writers\u201d.\n\u201cLike the original readers of His Dark Materials, Lyra has grown up. Her concerns are adult ones, and this new perspective \u2013 coupled with Philip\u2019s unflinching look at the human condition and his extraordinary storytelling \u2013 makes for a breathtaking read,\u201d said Penguin Random House Children\u2019s managing director Francesca Dow.\nDow compared the book to dystopian classics The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Never Let Me Go, saying it \u201cshows us a darker parallel world whose troubles echo our own\u201d. Pullman has previously quipped that The Book of Dust should be called \u201cHis Darker Materials\u201d.\n\u2018It used to be you who was impulsive,\u2019 said Pan, \u2018and me who kept holding you back. We\u2019re different now.\u2019\nShe nodded. \u2018Well, you know, things change \u2026 This isn\u2019t just shoplifting. This is murder.\u2019\n\u2018I know. I saw it.\u2019\n\u2018And maybe by doing this we\u2019d be helping the murderer get away with it. By interfering with the investigation. That can\u2019t be right.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s another thing,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\u2018You used to be optimistic. You used to think that whatever we did would turn out well. Even after we came back from the north, you used to think that. Now you\u2019re cautious, you\u2019re anxious \u2026 You\u2019re pessimistic.\u2019\nShe knew he was right, but it wasn\u2019t right that he should speak to her accusingly, as if it was something to blame her for.\n\u2018I used to be young,\u2019 was all she could find to say.\nHe made no response.\nThey didn\u2019t speak again till they reached the station. Then she said \u2018Pan, come here,\u2019 and he leapt up at once into her hands. She put him on her shoulder and said quietly, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to look out behind. Someone might be watching.\u2019",

Lyon houses an outstanding women\u2019s club team, arguably Europe\u2019s best, starring, among others, England\u2019s Lucy Bronze. \u201cIn Paris it\u2019s really difficult to make people come to women\u2019s sports events,\u201d admits Brigitte Henriques, the vice president of the French Football Federation. \u201cAnd we wanted to recognise Lyon\u2019s work. Lyon leads women\u2019s football in the world.\u201d\nIs it on television in the UK? Yes, the BBC has the rights and will cover every game via television, radio, its website or a mixture of all three.\nIs France safe? Terrorism is the biggest concern but the enduring anti-government Gilets Jaunes \u2013 or yellow vests- protests \u2013 could disrupt travel. The latest UK Foreign Office travel advisory states: \u201cTerrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats by Islamist terrorist groups the French government has reinforced its security measures and warned the public to be especially vigilant.\u201d Fans can expect airport-style checks at grounds.\nWill the referees be any good? Standards should be much improved. The 27 referees and 48 assistants attended an extended winter training camp in Doha, Qatar, where leading officials, including Germany\u2019s Bibiana Steinhaus, were put through their paces and fully briefed on VAR deployment.\nSo who are the favourites? The USA, coached by the English-born Jill Ellis, are defending champions and remain strong. France, managed by Corinne Diacre, who previously impressed during a stint in charge of second-tier men\u2019s side Clermont, should not be underestimated either. In January France comfortably beat the USA 3-1. Germany have been in transition but retain some top players while Japan were runners-up in 2015 and winners in 2011 and the Netherlands are Euro 2017 holders. Then there\u2019s England.\nHow might England do? Hard to say. Under the tactically clever Mark Sampson the Lionesses finished third at Canada 2015 before reaching Euro 2017\u2019s semi-finals. Phil Neville is now in charge and presiding over his first major tournament. Neville preaches an attractive, attacking, passing game and would ideally like to turn England into a female version of the Manchester United side he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson. In reality, his aim of winning the World Cup may entail unlocking his inner-Sampson and turning a little more pragmatic.\nA comprehensive 2-0 friendly home defeat to Sweden in November indicated a need for a plan B. Yet England should progress from an initial group also featuring Scotland, Japan and Argentina \u2013 not least because Argentina are surely the tournament\u2019s weakest side. If the Lionesses will miss the injured Jordan Nobbs\u2019s midfield talent, the WSL\u2019s all-professional status should help England\u2019s cause. Much may hinge on Jodie Taylor reprising her Euro 2017 golden boot-winning form.\nGroup AFranceSouth KoreaNorwayNigeria\u00a0\nGroup BGermanyChinaSpainSouth Africa\nGroup CAustraliaItalyBrazilJamaica\nGroup DEnglandScotlandArgentinaJapan\nGroup ECanadaCameroonNew ZealandNetherlands\nGroup FUSAThailandChileSweden\nWhat about Scotland? Shelley Kerr\u2019s side should, at worst, progress to the knockout stages as one of the best third-place finishers. The team have improved considerably since they were thrashed 6-0 by England at Euro 2017. Arsenal\u2019s gifted midfielder Kim Little is the undoubted star and cannot wait to face England in their opening game in Nice on 9 June.\nAny dark horses? Sweden, Canada and Australia. It will be intriguing to see how Australia \u2013 and their star player Sam Kerr \u2013 do in the wake of Alen Stajcic\u2019s sacking as coach and replacement with Ante Milicic.\nPotential stars? Sam Kerr (Australia), Kim Little (Scotland), Lucy Bronze (England), Alex Morgan (US), Vivianne Miedema (Netherlands) Wendie Renard (France), Kadeisha Buchanan (Canada), Mana Iwabuchi (Japan), Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n (Germany), Wang Shuang (China), Patri Guijarro (Spain), Asisat Oshoala (Nigeria).\nBest eco stadium? Stade Oc\u00e9ane in Le Havre \u2013 where England play Argentina on 14 June. Although a gorgeous bright blue when lit up, it is a super-green, state-of-the-art 25,000 all-seat arena, with a solar panelled roof providing 100% of energy while all water is recycled.

        "content": "Many cases in Asia and Africa are being missed and leading to children \u2018dying at home\u2019\nAlmost half of children with cancer are going undiagnosed and untreated, according to a new global study.\nThe research suggests that the situation depends on location: while only 3% of childhood cancer cases in western Europe and north America are thought to have been missed in 2015, the proportion rose to an estimated 49% in south Asia and 57% in western Africa.\n\u201cIt means that a lot of these children unfortunately are dying at home untreated,\u201d said Zachary Ward, first author of the research from Harvard University. \u201cCancer survival even among diagnosed cases is already poor in these countries, but it is going to be basically 0% for children if they are not identified.\u201d\nWard said many children faced difficulties accessing healthcare and, even if seen by doctors, their symptoms might be confused with other conditions such as TB or malaria.\n\u201cOnce we started to consider really what the challenges are that these children face, it is not that surprising that we are missing so many of them in these countries,\u201d he said.\nWriting in the Lancet Oncology journal, Ward and colleagues in the US report how they built a computer model that took into account factors including statistics on cancer incidence as well as the probability of children in a given country accessing healthcare and getting an appropriate referral and diagnosis.\nAs a result, the team were able to estimate the number of diagnosed and undiagnosed childhood cancer cases in 200 countries and territories around the world.\nData from cancer registries from 77 countries were then used as comparisons, allowing the team to adjust the model and make sure it worked well, with Ward adding that figures produced by the model chimed well with other estimates from high-income countries, further validating the approach.\nThe model suggests there were an estimated 397,000 cases of cancer worldwide in 2015 among those aged up to 14, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia the most common type of childhood cancer. However, only an estimated 224,000 children were diagnosed with any form of cancer, meaning 43% of cases were missed.\nThe researchers say around 92% of all new childhood cancer cases occur in low- and middle-income countries, with a particularly high rate in the countries of western Africa.\nWard said that was largely down to a higher prevalence of particular types of cancer, including Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, adding that, while genetics could play a role, environmental factors such as exposure to malaria and the Epstein-Barr virus could also increase the risk of certain cancers.\nWhen the team looked at future scenarios, they estimated there would be about 6.7m childhood cancer cases worldwide between 2015 and 2030 \u2013 but that 2.9m would be undiagnosed.\nBut Ward said there was hope. \u201cThe good news is that universal health coverage expansion, which a lot of countries have already committed themselves to, will help children access the health system,\u201d he said, although he stressed the need for investment in cancer registries so progress can be tracked.\nImportantly, he said, the study could help overturn misconceptions. \u201cIt is often said that childhood cancer is non-existent in developing countries where it is really because we have poor data in these countries,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the study has limitations, including that the team only had cancer registry data for two countries in west Africa.\nDr Claudia Allemani, associate professor of cancer epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said estimates like those in the new study could help to spur better strategies for cancer control. But, she said, cancer registries were vital.\n\u201cOnly real world data can give us the true picture in a given country or region of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cCancer registries must be given the legislative, political and financial stability to collect complete and high-quality data in a timely fashion.\u201d",

        "content": "Scientists say some marine animals with high levels of pollutants are failing to calve\nPlastics are an increasing cause of concern due to potential sources of chemicals that disrupt hormones and affect the growth and reproductive success of a wide variety of wildlife, according to a new report.\nWildlife in the oceans and on land are subject to cocktails of pollutants known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), but little is still known about how these common substances interact in the environment despite years of research. The increasing problem of plastic waste breaking down in fragile ecosystems is now one of the key areas of research for scientists.\nKiller whales with high levels of pollutants known as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were used in many plastics before being banned globally in 2004, have shown reproductive problems. A pod off the west coast of Scotland known to have high levels of PCBs has failed to produce a single calf in 25 years.\nOne washed-up orca, given the name Lulu by researchers, was found to have 957mg/kg of PCBs accumulated in lipid tissue, a level 100 times above the threshold of toxicity. Though of reproductive age, Lulu was found to have failed to calve.\n\u201cLulu was barren, as if she was a juvenile,\u201d said Paul Jepson from the Zoological Society of London and a co-author of the paper. \u201cBut she should have been in her prime.\u201d\nA recent model predicted that orca numbers globally could be halved within a century owing to PCBs to which marine mammals are particularly susceptible because fat-soluble EDCs accumulate in their tissues. Their high-fat milk and long lactation periods means mothers pass more of the toxins to their offspring.\nDespite the ban, the presence of PCBs in Europe seems to have stabilised since 1998 rather than declining further, perhaps owing to the chemicals leaching out of landfill sites or the breakdown of plastic and other products in which they were once common.\n\u201cWe are looking at the possible exposure [of marine life] and evidence of toxicity is still developing,\u201d said Jepson. While evidence abounds of sea birds, mammals and fish with plastic in their stomachs, many of the potential effects of PCBs are still unknown.\nWhile the release of EDCs has been shown to have harmful effects on wildlife populations, the interactions between such chemicals are still largely unknown, according to the paper published on Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. The paper did not examine the possible effects on human health from the presence of EDCs.\n\u201cWe do not know what proportion of chemicals are EDCs. There is a very large proportion of chemicals that we use every day that we know very little about,\u201d said John Sumpter, professor of ecotoxicology at Brunel University London and a co-author of the paper. \u201cThere is a huge gap in our knowledge. We just do not know what effect they are having.\u201d\nSumpter called for more work on predicting how chemicals interact in the environment, as current methods of testing chemicals after they are produced are too slow, and the interactions between different chemicals in the environment are hard to examine. \u201cWe are not very good at predicting what effect chemicals will have on the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get cleverer, to be able to look at the structure of chemicals and say this is how it will probably interact, based on that structure.\u201d\nThe endocrine system is the collection of glands that produce hormones, playing a critical role in nearly all biological functions including growth, development and reproduction. Some of the known sources of EDCs, such as PCBs, have been banned, but others are still in operation. These include synthetic hormones such as those used in the contraceptive pill, which has been found to have an effect on wildlife, including feminising certain male fish, even at very low concentrations.",

But the study shows this problem is far more profound than previously realised.\nResearchers baited, caught and examined subsea creatures from six of the deepest places in the world \u2013 the Peru-Chile trench in the south-east Pacific, the New Hebrides and Kermadec trenches in the south-west Pacific, and the Japan trench, Izu-Bonin trench and Mariana trench in the north-west Pacific.\nIn all six areas, they found ingestion of microparticles by amphipods \u2013 a shrimp-like crustacean that scavenges on the seabed. The deeper the region, the higher the rate of consumption. In the Mariana trench \u2013 which goes down to the lowest point on earth of 10,890 metres below sea level \u2013 100% of samples contained at least one microparticle.\nThe materials included polyester-reinforced cotton and fibres made of lyocell, rayon, ramie, polyvinyl and polyethylene. The breadth of substances and broad range of geographic sites prompted the authors to observe that increasing volumes of global plastic waste will find their way from surface gyres into these trenches.\n\u201cIt is intuitive that the ultimate sink for this debris, in whatever size, is the deep sea,\u201d they noted.\nOnce the materials reach these areas \u2013 often deeper below the surface than Mount Everest is high above it \u2013 the waste has nowhere else to go, said Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University, the lead author of the paper.\n\u201cIf you contaminate a river, it can be flushed clean. If you contaminate a coastline, it can be diluted by the tides. But, in the deepest point of the oceans, it just sits there. It can\u2019t flush and there are no animals going in and out of those trenches.\u201d\nThe effects on deep-sea species are as yet unclear, though scientists speculate they will experience the same problems of blocked digestive tracts and restricted mobility as creatures at higher depths. They may also be more vulnerable because the trenches are food-scarce ecosystems, which prompts scavengers and predators to gobble up anything they can find.\nJamieson said some new species are being discovered that have never been seen in an uncontaminated state. \u201cWe have no baseline to measure them against. There is no data about them in their pristine state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more you think about it, the more depressing it is.\u201d",

        "content": "Schemes aimed at low income British applicants have not stopped rise in foreign students\nOxford and Cambridge universities are teaching nearly 1,000 fewer British undergraduates than they were five years ago, despite spending millions of pounds on programmes designed to widen participation and improve access for disadvantaged UK applicants.\nFigures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency have shown that Oxford and Cambridge are almost alone among the competitive British universities in failing to expand their intake of domestic undergraduates while slowly increasing the proportion of sought-after places going to EU and international students.\nBut the two ancient universities defended their record, saying British applicants were far more likely to win admission as undergraduates than those from overseas, despite sharp increases in the numbers of applicants of all nationalities with the necessary grades.\nOxford said its undergraduate makeup was part of its mission to attract and educate the most talented students from across the world. \u201cWe are committed to our role in broadening participation in higher education and doing what it takes to make the university more open and diverse, and are making headway with this work,\u201d a university spokesperson said. \u201cBlack and ethnic minority students now make up more than 18% of our undergraduate intake, while for the second year in a row more students than ever before have come to Oxford from deprived areas of the UK.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Cambridge said: \u201cThe university has made significant progress in all its widening participation measures over the same period. The university accepts students on merit, regardless of their background.\u201d\nFigures supplied by Oxford showed that UK applicants are far more likely to be offered a place compared with their EU and non-EU peers. Nearly one in four UK applicants \u2013 23% - were made an offer, compared with one in 10 non-EU applicants and one in eight EU applicants.\nBut critics including the Sutton Trust and the Labour party argued that Oxbridge\u2019s priority should be to educate talented UK applicants, given the huge number of qualified applicants the two universities attract domestically.\n\u201cOur world-class universities should be there for all of us, not just the wealthiest and privileged, and urgent action is clearly needed to ensure they are open to talented students regardless of their background,\u201d said Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary.\nThe figures for the 2017-18 academic year show that Cambridge had 12,155 first degree students , just 295 more than five years earlier. Of those, 9,365 were from the UK, 245 fewer than in 2012-13.\nThe combined number of EU and other international undergraduates taking first degrees at Cambridge in the same period rose by 545 to 2,790, with most of the increase coming from 420 additional international students, including many from China.\nOxford showed similar changes, with 420 more international students and 400 fewer British undergraduates in the same five years.\nFigures first published by the BBC show that Cambridge has reduced the number of British undergraduates by 480 since 2007-08, while Oxford has reduced its intake by more than 700 in the same decade. In contrast, British universities such as Bristol and Exeter have increased their UK undergraduate numbers by more than 50%.\nAn indication of Oxbridge\u2019s strong international standing came in the publication of the latest QS world university rankings by subject, which showed Oxford was the highest-performing British university by taking five of the top places.\nOxford was named the best university in the world for English language and literature, pharmacy and pharmacology, archaeology, anthropology and geography, while Cambridge took the No 1 spot for the study of anatomy and physiology.\nOverall, the latest rankings were positive for British universities, which secured the top spot in 13 out of 48 subject areas this year, up from 10 last year.\nUniversity College London took the top spot for education and the study of architecture and the built environment; Sussex for development studies; the Royal College of Art for art and design; Loughborough for sports-related subjects; the Royal Veterinary College for veterinary science, and the London School of Economics for social policy and administration.\nBen Sowter, a director of research at QS, said: \u201cThe research data used to compile this edition was collected between 2013 and 2018, and the impact that our imminent exit from the EU will have on UK performance is still unknown.\u201d\nThe US leads the QS rankings by a considerable margin, with the UK in second place, but QS says America\u2019s higher education performance is faltering, with the number of top rankings at subject level down from 34 last year to 28 this year.\n This article was amended on 28 February 2019. An earlier version quoted figures for Cambridge of \u201c12,155 first year students for first degrees\u201d. The figures are for all students doing first degrees, not just those in their first year.",

It\u2019s more like a structured silhouette [with which] I want to give power to women.\u201d\nHe added of his Saint Laurent woman: \u201cShe\u2019s not a warrior, she\u2019s not mean, she\u2019s just confident.\u201d\nOther Saint Laurent hallmarks were also present, such as the iconic le smoking jacket, which came as a classic with silk lapels as well as reworked into a black patent mac and a long dress. The latter will likely prove a hit on the red carpet \u2013 where the label regularly appears \u2013 thanks to it drawing the fine line between empowerment and sensuality. Meanwhile, the masculine military-style wool coats that opened the show in grey, white and black, showed that it wasn\u2019t just about clothes for a special occasion.\nStaged in a giant mirrored box erected in the Fontaine du Trocadero against the glittering backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, Vaccarello created something of a light show of his own. Inside, a lightrod installation behind two-way mirrored glass was on such a large scale that it rivalled the lights of the famous landmark outside.\nDespite the dazzling display lasting the entirety of the 20-minute show and providing what many described as \u201ca fashion moment\u201d afterwards, the designer played it down backstage. \u201cI had no concept [for the lights], they came because we have to do a show and for a show you need lights and I prefer to do a light decoration.\u201d\nThe second part of the show, in which models walk in UV light on the other side of the giant screens did, however, serve more than a creative purpose. Under an ultraviolet lens, the new line of flouro shoes that the brand is introducing for next season seemed to walk themselves, making the footwear the most memorable takeaway from the collection.\nIt was a savvy move given Vaccarello\u2019s form for creating the most lusted after shoes of seasons past. The slouchy, thigh-high boots covered in 3,000 rhinestones on each foot, which he designed in 2017 and which went viral after Rihanna wore them, were on waiting lists around the world despite their $10,000 (\u00a37,545) price tag. Saint Laurent will be hoping that they help them make their revenue target of \u20ac2bn by 2022, which CEO Francesca Bellettini said last November they were on track to do.",

The measure marks a fresh sign of the party\u2019s growing support for a once fringe idea that will play a defining role in the 2020 presidential campaign.\nThe Medicare for All Act of 2019, to be formally introduced on Wednesday with 107 co-sponsors, would transform the American healthcare system from one in which millions of Americans are uninsured to one that provides universal coverage.\n\u201cThe state of our healthcare system is absolutely atrocious,\u201d said the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is introducing the bill with Michigan congresswoman Debbie Dingell. \u201cHow is it possible that the United States, the richest country in the world, is the only major country that does not guarantee healthcare to our residents?\u201d\nShe added: \u201cAmericans are literally dying because they can\u2019t afford insulin or the cancer treatment they need.\u201d\nThe bill would establish a national health insurance program by gradually expanding Medicare \u2013 the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older \u2013 until it covered all Americans.\n\u201cEverybody in, nobody out,\u201d Jayapal said, describing coverage under the plan, which she said amounted to a \u201ccomplete transformation of our healthcare system\u201d.\nThe bill does not include details on how the government would pay for the new healthcare system, which some studies have estimated could cost tens of trillions of dollars over the next decade.\nJayapal envisions major savings as a result of reducing administrative costs and inefficiencies in the current healthcare system. To pay for the plan, she suggested proposals such as taxing the rich at higher rates and mandated employer contributions.\nA universal healthcare plan that moves the US closer to the systems in Canada and the UK has long been a dream of the party\u2019s left.\nA version of the legislation was first introduced in 2003 by the former congressman John Conyers of Michigan, but the idea began to gain traction when Senator Bernie Sanders championed the issue in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. The year after, a majority of the House Democratic caucus supported Conyers\u2019 bill while one-third of Senate Democrats signed on to Sanders\u2019 version.\nThe plan comes amid a widening debate over how boldly to reform the American healthcare system, pitting progressives clamoring for Medicare for All against moderates pushing for smaller-scale changes. Several Democratic hopefuls have endorsed the idea of a universal healthcare system but are split over the details.\nThe plan has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. But the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has promised to allow hearings on the bill for the first time, giving progressives a prominent platform to make the case for a single-payer system.\nSupporters speak about universal healthcare as a moral imperative. They argue that millions cannot afford the rising out-of-pocket costs most are obliged to pay when insurance coverage is less than comprehensive.\nSome Democrats, conscious that many Americans are wary of losing their current insurance options, are pushing for more incremental changes to the healthcare system, such as allowing people between 50 and 64 to buy into the Medicare system and imposing a cap on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\nPolling shows that a growing share of Americans, frustrated with the rising costs of healthcare, support a so-called \u201csingle-payer\u201d system, where the payer is the government. Surveys have, however, found that support drops when respondents are asked their view if the program would result in higher taxes or longer waiting times for treatment.\nBut as momentum grows, so, too, does the opposition. Private health insurers, doctors and hospitals are partnering to oppose single-payer proposals, which could significantly affect their bottom line.\nThe Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future has been mobilizing members to ramp up support for improving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as opposed to repealing it, as Republicans attempted to do, or replacing it with a new system.\n\u201cMedicare for All may be a catchy slogan,\u201d the group tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cbut it would do more harm than good for Americans who deserve affordable coverage and high quality care.\u201d\nHalf of Americans have employer-sponsored health insurance. Polling suggests that they, by and large, like their plans and want to keep them. Others receive coverage through a patchwork of public health programs and private insurers.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are eager to see Democratic 2020 candidates embrace the plan, confident it will help cast the party as too liberal and out of touch with everyday Americans.\nUnder the proposal, Medicare would become the country\u2019s universal insurer. But the bill would also make significant changes to the American healthcare program, by greatly expanding the type of coverage offered and eliminating all deductibles, copays and premiums.\nAccording to a summary of the legislation provided by Jayapal\u2019s staff, the program would cover \u201cprimary care, hospital and outpatient services, prescription drugs, dental, vision, audiology, women\u2019s reproductive health services, maternity and newborn care, long-term services and supports, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, laboratory and diagnostic services, ambulatory services, and more\u201d.\nThe transition to a Medicare for All system would happen over the course of two years. The authors know the bill has no chance of becoming law as long as Trump occupies the White House, but they hope to lay the groundwork for a future Democratic president. Activists are working with progressive members to help build public support for the plan.\n\u201cWe will be pushing it as far as we can, as hard as we can, as fast as we can,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cEnough nibbling around the edges. We really need to transform the system.\u201d",

China controls another part in the east.\nIndia and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.\nHow did the dispute start?\nAfter the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.\nKashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.\nIn 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.\nIn its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.\nWhat was Kashmir\u2019s special status?\nKashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u00a0\nAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.\nOn Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had\u00a0 only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.\nWhat do the militants want?\nThere has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.\nUntil 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u00a0extreme force\u00a0in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.\nFor Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe\nTuesday\u2019s attacks followed nearly a fortnight of sabre-rattling between the pair over the southern Kashmir suicide bombing, in which India has claimed Pakistan had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d. JeM is based in Pakistan but Islamabad has rejected any responsibility for the attack.\nGokhale said Indian jets struck JeM\u2019s largest training camp in the Balakot area, claiming a \u201cvery large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis being trained for fidayeen [suicide] action were eliminated.\u201d The facility, which he described as being in thick forest on a hilltop, was far away from any civilian settlements,overseen by the brother-in-law of the JeM chief, Masood Azhar, he added.\nSignificantly, Balakot is in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, about 50 miles from the line of control and well into accepted Pakistan territory. An attack there would represent an escalation from previous Indian reprisals.\n\u201cIt changes the game significantly by raising the costs for Pakistan,\u201d said Khalid Shah, a research fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.\nIslamabad released pictures on social media showing uprooted trees and cratered soil, which it claimed was the extent of the damage from the Indian bombing.\nLocal media in Pakistan as well as Reuters quoted residents of Balakot who said they heard four to five blasts overnight which damaged homes and left large pockmarks in the ground.\nThe conflicting narratives over the attack echo India\u2019s claims in September 2016 it sent special forces to destroy militant facilities over the ceasefire border \u2013 an attack that Pakistan still maintains never happened.\nThe opposing positions allowed India to trumpet its reprisal against Pakistan without forcing Islamabad to respond in a way that might spiral into a larger conflict.\nIndian ministers lauded the airstrikes. \u201cIt was an act of extreme valour,\u201d said Prakash Javadekar, the human resources development minister, in the first official acknowledgement of the operation.\nAnother minister, Vijay Kumar Singh, posted a picture on Twitter of an eagle with a snake in its talons. \u201cThey say they want to bleed India with 1,000 cuts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe say that each time you attack us, be certain we will get back at you, harder and stronger.\u201d\nDespite Pakistan downplaying the impact of the attacks, Khan, whose successful election campaign last year featured strident promises to stand up to India, could still face popular pressure to respond.\n\u201cStrategically, it is a disaster for Pakistan that India can keep doing this,\u201d said Mosharraf Zaidi, a political analyst and columnist, referring to both Tuesday\u2019s attack and the September 2016 strikes. \u201cWhat does it say about Pakistan\u2019s red lines that countries like India can keep violating our airspace or claim they have carried out surgical strikes?\u201d\nSherry Rahman, a Pakistani senator and former ambassador the US, said the attack was aimed at Indian PM Narendra Modi\u2019s re-election. \u201cIndia is giving its own people a message with these strikes; this is for their electorate, the domestic voters.\u201d\nWhile exchanges of artillery and light weapons over the line are very common, intentional incursions by aircraft have not been publicly acknowledged since the two countries fought a war in 1971.\nMilitary planes could be heard over Srinagar, the capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir, in the early hours of Tuesday morning. There has been a large troop buildup in the region in recent days and doctors have been advised to cancel leave and stockpile medicines.\nSeveral convoys of trucks carrying heavy artillery were being transported on highways to northern Kashmir towards the line of control. Both India and Pakistan were trading heavy mortar fire across the ceasefire line on Tuesday night.\nMore than 300 Kashmiri separatist activists have been detained in recent days. Hours after the attack on Tuesday morning, officers from the National Investigation Agency raided the Srinagar homes of two veteran separatist leaders, Yasin Malik, who was among those detained at the weekend, and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.\nAssociated Press contributed to this report",

He is a scapegoat, not a child abuser. In my opinion.\u201d\nAlthough Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun proudly pointed to a front page report by Lucie Morris-Marr from 2016 which revealed Pell was under investigation, it also published an extraordinary piece by Bolt attacking the successful prosecution case as \u201cflimsy\u201d.\n\u201cIn my opinion, this is our own OJ Simpson case, but in reverse. A man was found guilty not on the facts but on prejudice,\u201d Bolt wrote.\n\u201cCardinal George Pell has been falsely convicted of sexually abusing two boys in their early teens. That\u2019s my opinion, based on the overwhelming evidence.\u201d\nTomorrow\u2019s @theheraldsun front page tonight #springst #auspol @s_deery pic.twitter.com/O3RsxEGLXm\nOn his Sky News program Bolt said Pell was a man \u201cwho\u2019s been made to pay for the sins made by his church\u201d.\nAfter Morris-Marr left the Herald Sun in 2016, she accused News Corp of not renewing her contract because of a dispute with Bolt over the Pell story. Bolt wrote a column in the same paper calling it a \u201cvicious\u201d smear that formed part of a \u201csinister\u201d campaign.\nIn her nationally syndicated column in the Daily Telegraph, Miranda Devine said the victim\u2019s \u201caccusations are implausible\u201d and Pell was innocent.\nDevine, a Catholic, has always been a strong supporter of Pell. In 2017 she alleged that his charges were drummed up by Victoria police as a distraction from a supposed crime epidemic.\n\u201cVictoria police chief Graham Ashton desperate for a distraction from the crime epidemic he\u2019s incapable of stopping #HuntingCatholics,\u201d she said on Twitter.\nUnsurprisingly there's one story dominating the front pages today.#MediaWatch pic.twitter.com/XBYaWSyoNZ\nOn Wednesday Devine said the verdict was devastating and Pell was a big scalp for the \u201crotten Vatican\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating because I don\u2019t believe that Pell, who I know slightly and admire greatly, could be guilty of sexually assaulting two choirboys in a busy cathedral after Sunday mass when he was archbishop of Melbourne in 1996,\u201d Devine wrote in the Daily Telegraph.\u201d\nMurdoch\u2019s national broadsheet, the Australian, took the unusual decision to publish on the front page two critics who argued the victim\u2019s testimony was improbable. The legal academic and vice chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Greg Craven, blamed the police and the media, in particular the ABC journalist Louise Milligan, who wrote a Walkley-award winning book on Pell.\nBrutal. pic.twitter.com/raoF7xFcJP\n\u201cThis is where the Pell case has gone terribly wrong,\u201d Craven wrote. \u201cImpartial judge and jury [excepted], parts of the media \u2013 notably the ABC and former Fairfax journalists \u2013 have spent years attempting to ensure Pell is the most odious figure in Australia.\n\u201cThey seemed to want him in the dock as an ogre, not a defendant.\n\u201cSo what we have witnessed is a combined effort by much of the media, including the public broadcaster, and elements of Victoria\u2019s law enforcement agency, to blacken the name of someone before he went to trial.\u201d\nCraven was one of 10 people to give character references for Pell before sentencing.\nThe Jesuit priest and human rights lawyer Frank Brennan, who attended some of the trial, argued the victim\u2019s evidence \u2013 given behind closed doors \u2013 was \u201cconfused\u201d and the jury must have discarded the defence\u2019s compelling arguments.\n\u201cThe proposition that the offences charged were committed immediately after mass by a fully robed archbishop in the sacristy with an open door and in full view from the corridor seemed incredible to my mind,\u201d Brennan wrote.\nA senior journalist, John Ferguson, who did not cover the trial, was also not convinced.\n\u201cAs unpopular as Pell is in the secular community, indeed among many Catholics, there are valid questions to be asked about whether the jury got it right,\u201d Ferguson wrote in an analysis piece on an inside page. \u201cThis task is made difficult by the fact the sole living accuser from the cathedral scandal did not give public evidence.\n\u201cIs it believable that Pell would so recklessly and aggressively rape and molest in a cathedral, knowing there was a high risk of being caught? Is it plausible that he committed these crimes while engineering the Melbourne Response to help compensate abuse victims?\n\u201cIs it probable beyond reasonable doubt that Pell did this?\u201d",

I think any Australian would be, to read of those events.\n\u201cBut it shows no one is above the law in this country \u2026 I don\u2019t intend to engage in that other than to say, to all of you out there who have been the victims of child sexual abuse: know we are thinking of you.\u201d\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nMorrison\u2019s criticism of Pell contrasted with the former Liberal prime minister John Howard, who has noted that Pell \u201cdenies guilt and he is appealing\u201d.\n\u201cIn those circumstances, it is utterly inappropriate for me to say anything more about those particular charges,\u201d Howard said on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to.\u201d\nHoward was among the character referees for Pell cited by his lawyer, Robert Richter QC, in his sentence plea hearing on Wednesday.\nRichter then gives the judge a whole book of submissions about sentencing - it includes character references from John Howard, and high profile QC\u2019s. Pell\u2019s medical records are also in the book. https://t.co/IwVXHDuuHO\nIf Morrison refers Pell\u2019s Order of Australia to the council, it would offer Pell a chance to respond before making a recommendation to the governor general to revoke the honour.\nOther Australian institutions have already moved to strip Pell of honours, including the Richmond Football Club which has revoked Pell\u2019s honorary position, and St Patrick\u2019s College in Ballarat, the school Pell attended, which has removed his name from a building.",

        "content": "Exclusive: Inquiry follows claims it ignored warning signs before alleged Rohingya genocide\nThe UN has launched an inquiry into its conduct in Myanmar over the past decade, where it has been accused of ignoring warning signs of escalating violence prior to an alleged genocide of the Rohingya minority.\nUN sources have confirmed to the Guardian that the initially hesitant UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, decided to proceed with the investigation after a \u201cbuild-up in pressure\u201d within the organisation.\nIt will be headed by Gert Rosenthal, a former foreign minister and Guatemalan permanent representative to the UN, who is thought to have begun overseeing meetings in the role.\n\u201cThis review is not directed at any particular individual or agency, but rather at how the United Nations as an institution works on the ground and possible lessons learned for the future,\u201d said Stanislav Saling, a spokesperson for the UN in Myanmar, adding that Rosenthal had no plans to travel to Myanmar for his investigations.\nA senior UN official in New York, who asked not to be identified, said Rosenthal was chosen because \u201che\u2019s considered to be a very serious and sober expert on UN workings. He knows the house from many different perspectives and is known to be someone who will speak his mind.\u201d\nThere have been multiple calls for a full inquiry into UN operations in Myanmar in recent years, which were described as \u201cglaringly dysfunctional\u201d in a memo written months before the military-led crackdown on the Rohingya in Rakhine state in August 2017.\nThe violence, described by the UN as ethnic cleansing and possible genocide, included the killing of thousands of people, women and children raped, villages razed and forced more than 700,000 to flee over the border to Bangladesh. Marzuki Darusman, the chair of the UN fact-finding Mission on Myanmar, said late last year there was an \u201congoing genocide\u201d in Rakhine.\nPhil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that the UN is planning to engage in some serious soul-searching to understand what went wrong with their handling of the Myanmar crisis.\n\u201cQuite clearly, they failed to see and warn the world about what was clear to us and many others long before August 2017 \u2013 that the Burmese military was looking for an opportunity to launch a massive ethnic cleansing operation to get rid of the Rohingya.\u201d\nCriticism of the UN\u2019s response has focused on allegations against Renata Lok-Dessallien, a former resident coordinator of Myanmar, who was accused of downplaying concerns about worsening abuses against the Rohingya; discouraging public statements critical of the NLD government, led by the de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi; prioritising development strategies at the expense of human rights; and even suppressing internal reports that she did not like. The UN has denied most of these claims.\nHowever, several UN figures and diplomats said the emphasis on Lok-Dessallien was misplaced, and that the UN failings were a reflection of much bigger issues within the UN system and the diplomatic community in Myanmar as a whole. In 2017 the UN described Lok-Dessallien \u201cas a tireless advocate for human rights\u201d.\nThe recent UN fact-finding mission to Myanmar, which concluded that the country\u2019s military generals should be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity for their actions against the Rohingya and other minorities, also called for a review into UN conduct in Myanmar, echoing a recommendation made months earlier by Yanghee Lee, UN special rapporteur for human rights to the country.\n\u201cThe review needs to be independent from the UN and made available publicly when finished,\u201d Lee told the Guardian.\nIndeed, there are concerns that the inquiry will be purposefully limited in its scope and impact and it is not clear if the final report will be made public.\nAccording to insiders, there is a wariness within the upper levels of the organisation that amid a climate of increasing hostility towards the UN by governments such as the US, a more wide-ranging inquiry report could sow division and damage the organisation\u2019s reputation and ability to continue its peacemaking and humanitarian work. The source in New York said moves to initiate the review were stalled by internal tensions.\nAfter a hiatus following the controversy around her leadership in Myanmar, Lok-Dessallien is widely expected to be appointed UN resident coordinator for India. She is likely to take up the post before the completion of the Myanmar inquiry, leading to further doubts over the chances it will prompt any individual accountability.\nSources within the UN system said officials at the the organisation\u2019s headquarters in New York did not want a repeat of the damning and internally controversial 2012 Petrie report, authored by the former UN assistant secretary general Charles Petrie.\nIt concluded that during the endgame of the Sri Lankan civil war, where tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed, there had been a \u201csystemic failure\u201d by UN agencies on the ground to speak out for and protect civilians.\nIndividuals and agencies singled out for criticism in the review objected strongly to how their actions were characterised, leading to rifts inside the world body over how to follow up to the investigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to say: \u2018Here we go again\u2019,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThere were supposed to be lessons learned after the fiasco in Sri Lanka in 2009 but apparently there weren\u2019t.\u201d\nThe review headed by Rosenthal will use Sri Lanka as a reference point against which to judge what lessons have not been learned within the UN system, the Guardian has been told.\nComparisons between Sri Lanka and Myanmar were made in a confidential report commissioned by the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights in Myanmar in 2015.\n\u201cThe situation bears a striking resemblance to the humanitarian community\u2019s systematic failure in the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka, during which hundreds of thousands of Tamils were held against their will in internment camps that were fully paid for and serviced by international humanitarian institutions,\u201d the 2015 report says.\nAllegations of UN dysfunction in Myanmar have continued since Lok-Dessallien\u2019s departure in 2017. The fact-finding mission report, which was released last August, noted that some UN entities in Myanmar had not cooperated with the investigation.\n\u201cThings are not as dysfunctional as they were,\u201d said a UN insider based in Geneva, who asked to remain unnamed. \u201cBut the fundamental problems and deep divisions in opinion, response and strategy remain unresolved. Hopefully the Rosenthal review might be the vehicle that enables them to be addressed.\u201d",

        "content": "The Robert W Wilson MCC Theater Space, New York\nCreators of Spring Awakening have made a well-intentioned yet misjudged attempt to combine Lewis Carroll\u2019s tale with a second world war romance \nBombs are falling through the air, splintering the darkness of the London night while children cower in a tube shelter, deep underground. But bombs can fall inside, too, like Alice by Heart, an extravagantly well-intentioned and hopelessly inert new musical at MCC. Written by Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater, the creators of Spring Awakening, with direction and a co-writing by Waitress\u2019s Jessie Nelson, this is a musical through the looking glass, in love with its own reflection.\nIt is 1941, and a teenage girl named Alice Spencer (Molly Gordon) uses the Lewis Carroll stories to escape the horrors of the Blitz. During one curiously terrible evening, her best friend Alfred (Colton Ryan) is diagnosed with incurable tuberculosis and a Red Cross nurse rips apart her books. (Red Cross nurses, the worst, right?) Alice, who has learned the stories by heart, retreats into her fantasy world, dragging the dying Alfred with her.\nThe Alice stories are pretty well dog-eared when it comes to popular culture. Once you\u2019ve inspired both a top-grossing pornographic comedy and a popular Disneyland ride, you know you\u2019ve arrived. That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t inspire the occasional new musical. And inspiration isn\u2019t the trouble here. Alice by Heart lacks the hard graft of creating fully realized characters and a recognizable world.\nSheik\u2019s score gifts Alice a nicely mournful opening song, West of Words, but it doesn\u2019t really suggest who she is or where she is or what her life is like. About Alfred we know even less, though as he\u2019s coughing up gouts of blood, it\u2019s probably best not to get attached. The establishing scenes inside the shelter are wildly overwritten and already topsy-turvy, too full of Carroll-like word play and weird jokes to really establish anything. A few rhymed couplets and Spam jokes later and Alice is off into Wonderland, courtesy of Sater\u2019s less than inspired lyrics: \u201cAnd now we\u2019re down the hole / And really on a roll.\u201d Every barely introduced shelter character has a Carroll analog. The nurse transforms into the Red Queen, a shellshocked soldier is the Mad Hatter. Alfred becomes the watch-toting White Rabbit, his life tick-tick-ticking away.\nAs Alice, Gordon is oddly bland. Her voice blends sweetly, but it\u2019s underpowered and her British accent, shaky at the best of times, collapses every time she sings. Ryan has the richer voice, but even less of a character to inhabit. Most of the other roles are overplayed, blown up to make them feel fuller. The staging at least is fluid and the choreography, by Rick and Jeff Kuperman, often inventive. Sheik\u2019s score, ballad after ballad, doesn\u2019t lack for prettiness and there are occasional touches of wit in the orchestrations, like a steel drum solo. But it often sounds like a pallid echo of Spring Awakening. Purple Summer ended that show; Winter Blooms, with its those you love still walk behind you message, finishes this one.\nThe creators have assumed a comprehensive familiarity with the Alice stories. Expertise will decode some of the scenes, but it won\u2019t really deepen or repair the musical. Any narrative propulsion bogs down during set pieces \u2013 the lobster dance, the Jabberwocky \u2013 and the psychologizing won\u2019t quit. Hours in the rehearsal room must have been devoted to What It All Means \u2013 innocence, experience, trauma, sexual awakening. But without a strong sense of who this Alice is and was and will be, her journey goes nowhere. It doesn\u2019t mean much. This is no Wonderland.",

        "content": "Anne Davies visits the marginal seats of Sydney\u2019s outer suburbs where residents are angry about congestion and overdevelopment and wary of promises to fix it\nIn East Hills it\u2019s the duplexes steadily marching across the suburban landscape replacing small post-war fibro homes on quarter-acre blocks. In the seat of Penrith it\u2019s medium density springing up near railway stations. In Riverstone it\u2019s crowding at local primary schools, as new suburbs open up on the north-west fringe.\nAnd everywhere voters are united in their anger about the traffic on Sydney\u2019s roads and the lack of public transport that forces people into their cars for a long and infuriating commute to work, to school, to anywhere.\nThe question facing voters in south-west and western Sydney is this: has Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s government got the right prescription for dealing with the weight of population that is straining Sydney\u2019s outer suburbs? Would Labor be better?\nThe Liberals will be showcasing the large number of infrastructure projects now under way and asking voters to be patient, that improvements are around the corner.\nLabor, led by Michael Daley, will be hoping that people have forgotten its poor record investing in transport and will be promising big on hospitals, schools and measures to alleviate the cost of living.\nThere are only two truly marginal Liberal seats up for grabs \u2013 East Hills (0.4% Liberal) and Penrith (6.2% Liberal) \u2013 but there are a swag of other seats in the middle to outer ring of Sydney that Labor believes could swing their way in this volatile environment.\nThese include Oatley (6.6%), Holsworthy (6.7%), Heathcote (7.6%), Seven Hills (8.7%) Mulgoa (9.7%) and Riverstone (10.2%).\nOnce safe territory for Labor, the middle and outer rings of western and south-western Sydney have become the battleground due to demographic change and efforts by the Liberal party to appeal to what the former prime minister John Howard called his \u201cbattlers\u201d.\nA raft of seats swung to the Liberals federally in the 1990s but some have swung back.\nAt the state level, these areas were mostly safe Labor until 2011, when the electorate delivered a thumping defeat to the Keneally government. Tired of corruption scandals and lack of action on transport, the middle and outer suburbs of Sydney punished Labor with swings of up to 27%.\nSome like Strathfield, Granville and Campbelltown have returned to Labor, but the Liberals still hold half a dozen seats with solid margins.\nThe best prospect for Labor in 2019 is East Hills, where Cameron Murphy \u2013 a barrister and son of former high court judge Lionel Murphy \u2013 is running again against a new Liberal candidate, Wendy Lindsay, who was head of a local P&C.\nAccording to Murphy the big issue is overdevelopment. In East Hills, streets of suburban fibro homes on large blocks are being replaced by large duplexes with just one garage.\n\u201cThe problem it\u2019s creating is the streets are full, because the duplexes usually have four or five bedrooms and most people use the garage for storage. Emergency vehicles, garbage trucks can\u2019t get down the street. In some parts of the electorate, the council has put in no stopping between 6pm and 6am,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI think everyone accepts that Sydney is a growing city but it\u2019s not being shared across the city fairly. That\u2019s the problem people have. We are not getting any infrastructure to go with it,\u201d he says.\nMurphy says that voters are concerned the area will lose its charm as a suburban pocket just 20km from the city.\nOne longtime resident of Padstow, Ken Tyrell, summed up his discontent at change in East Hills, as he waited for his fish and chips at the local shop.\n\u201cIt was a pretty good suburb, Revesby,\u201d he says. \u201cEven 20 years ago.\u201d\n\u201cI loved the place, but I have seen it degraded. It\u2019s now unliveable, it\u2019s overpowering,\u201d he says.\nTyrell believes the issue underlying it is overpopulation, and though he\u2019s normally a Liberal voter, he says he\u2019ll take a good look at One Nation this time around.\nInfrastructure is under stress. Schools have demountable classrooms, the trains are full and the main roads congested, Murphy says. He now leaves increasingly early to get to work in the city, he says.\nAnd then there is the issue of cost of living: tolls, electricity bills and rising house prices that make it difficult to buy into the area.\nLindsay, the Liberal candidate, acknowledges that the duplex development is an issue but says it\u2019s one for council and that good design is what\u2019s needed. She also points out that the villages that make up her electorate \u2013 Revesby, Padstow, Panania \u2013 will only survive if there is enough population to keep local businesses alive.\nShe points to the Liberals\u2019 record: the M5 duplication of the tunnel is getting close to opening; there\u2019s been $25m invested in Bankstown hospital and a mobile ServiceNSW centre at Revesby.\nLast election Murphy was the subject of an ugly smear campaign in which his posters were defaced and anonymous leaflets distributed insinuating that because he was a former chair of the Civil Liberties Council he was a protector of paedophiles. He\u2019s hoping for a cleaner fight this time.\nThe second most marginal seat in western Sydney is Penrith, held by the Liberal sports minister, Stuart Ayres.\nAs the man responsible for the unpopular decision to knock down Allianz stadium and extensively rebuild Homebush stadium at a cost of $1.5bn, one might expect he\u2019d be feeling the pressure.\nQuite the contrary. \u201cThe main thing I hear is why isn\u2019t Penrith getting one,\u201d he says of the local reaction.\n\u201cI think people know when they travel into the city to a game that Allianz is old and doesn\u2019t meet standard,\u201d he said.\nHe also points to the new 30,000-seat western Sydney stadium at Parramatta that will open in April.\nPenrith used to be Labor heartland \u2013 Ayres himself says it\u2019s socio-economically smack bang in the middle of middle Australia \u2013 but somehow it\u2019s drifted away.\n\u201cI think Penrith remembers that Labor didn\u2019t do anything, they took them for granted. But there are a lot of new voters in Penrith and they are concerned about working closer to home and we are working on that,\u201d he says.\nThe Coalition has lavished resources on Penrith. The Northern Road and Mulgoa Road are being widened, there\u2019s a new commuter car park at Penrith station, and the government announced a $1bn upgrade of Nepean hospital two years ago which is now under way.\nLast week the government announced (at Nepean) 5,000 new nurse positions and some of these will go to relieving the chronic shortage of staff and the long waiting lists at Nepean.\nAyres also points out that the west and Penrith are home to a lot of tradies and construction workers and they have been benefiting from the billions being spent on Westconnex. But with the Westconnex project also comes disruption and tolls.\nKaren McKeown, a longtime councillor on Penrith council, is running for Labor.\nAside from parking in Penrith \u2013 arguably a local government issue \u2013 the big issue is the cost of living.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nitty-gritty of the power bill coming in, back to school costs, and how do we cope. The tolls come up heavily,\u201d McKeown says.\nTolls reintroduced since the M4 was widened are based on distance and range from $1.91 to $4.93. But there will be more tolls once the M4 east \u2013 a tunnel section from Homebush to Haberfield \u2013 opens.\nMcKeown says that 65% of Penrith residents travel east for work either by train or road so it\u2019s a big impost.\n\u201cIts $2,000 a year,\u201d she says of the new toll. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between a new computer, or taking the kids on a holiday,\u201d she says.\nLabor has promised a cashback scheme, similar to the M5 cashback as part of its suite of policies to alleviate cost of living pressures.\nMcKeown says the cost of power comes up time and again while doorknocking. \u201cThey remember the poles and wires privatisation,\u201d she says.\nAnd then there is the issue of overdevelopment. In Penrith it\u2019s manifesting mainly as eight- to 12-storey unit blocks near stations. McKeown says there is a sense that western Sydney is bearing an unfair burden of housing the growing population.\nIn the south-west the issues are also about infrastructure and development. But Melanie Gibbons, the Liberal member for Holsworthy, is banking on her voters recognising what the Berejiklian government has done to improve infrastructure, rather than dwelling on the possible cost impacts of tolls.\nThe multicultural seat straddles Liverpool and Prestons but runs south into the shire which is safer Liberal territory. The other two seats of Oatley and Heathcote on single-digit margins are also in the shire.\nGibbons points to the government\u2019s rail upgrades and new commuter car parks at Edmondson Park and Casula as proof that the government is meeting the challenge.\n\u2018\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting electorate to represent,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can fight for car parks for commuters, fight for hospitals, for schools and jobs to keep them close to their homes,\u201d she says.\nAs for whether there is any blowback from the M5 duplication project, Gibbons says people are just looking for quick and easy ways to get home.\n\u201cThey often comment how silly it was the M5 was only built with two lanes each way, so I think they are just happy to finally see it fixed,\u201d she says.\nIn the north-west of Sydney it\u2019s the new suburbs of detached houses that are both changing the character of the electorate and adding to the stresses and strains.\nThe local children\u2019s GP Dr Annemarie Christie is running as Labor\u2019s candidate, against the sitting MP, Mark Conolly, in Riverstone where young families moving into new suburbs have turned the old safe Labor semi-rural seat into a safe-ish Liberal seat.\nChristie is determined to put it to the test and attempt to get at least a 10.2% swing.\n\u201cSchools are a major issue because there are so many kids here,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have more demountables in our schools than any other electorate. Some of the children in our electorate will go through 13 years of school without ever seeing the inside of a proper classroom,\u201d she says.\nChristie says that some of the schools have been open for just five years and are already at capacity, raising serious questions about why the government\u2019s planning has failed the area so badly.\nThe Ponds high school, for instance, opened in 2015, and has had a staggered intake to year 10. But it\u2019s now full and there are two more years of intake to come: 800 students, says Christie.\n\u201cIn two years time that brand new high school will have 50 demountables. At the same time a block of land earmarked for a high school was sold off, because they said they wouldn\u2019t need it.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the issue of hospitals, also close to Christie\u2019s heart. The government has announced plans for a new hospital at Rouse Hill, but for the foreseeable future the voters in the north-west will be making the 20km trek to Westmead.\nBerejiklian has been calling for an immigration reduction as part of her solution to Sydney\u2019s growing pains. But her key message is: we\u2019ve been building things.\nIn the north-west, her government is now testing the new metro service between Rouse Hill and Chatswood. It should be open in April.\nDaley will be focusing on what she hasn\u2019t done, particularly in the area of schools and hospitals, and arguing that the west is taking an unfair burden to house Sydney\u2019s population.\nIt will be a tough ask to win back the swag of seats he needs, but he must win in the west if Labor is to have any chance of regaining government \u2013 this election or the next.",

        "content": "National Art School Gallery highlights the magnetic, untamed energy of Boyd\u2019s famous paintings alongside never-before-seen work\nArthur Boyd\u2019s wife Yvonne sits on a chair in the dappled light of a Suffolk forest. She is naked: her legs are slightly ajar, her breasts sagging, her hair tied back messily. She looks down, away from the viewer, as if deep in thought.\nThe painting \u2013 which Yvonne insisted be kept private, a moment shared by her and her husband only \u2013 has never been seen by the public before. It is the surprise jewel in Arthur Boyd: Landscape of the Soul, which opened at Sydney\u2019s National Art School Gallery earlier this year and which will tour regional galleries until 2021.\n\u201cThere is very English light, the tone is impeccable, the tone of the flesh is quietly synergising with the forest,\u201d says the curator Barry Pearce, on a walk-through of the exhibition. \u201cIt is one of the great paintings of the female nude in Australian art.\u201d\nPearce discovered Figure on a chair (1973) wrapped in a container at the Boyds\u2019 Shoalhaven property Bundanon in 1992. He was immediately drawn to it: in particular to the honesty \u201cin allowing exposure of her ageing flesh and yet projecting a great sense of dignity, humanity and beauty against the passing of time\u201d.\nEager to include it in a major Arthur Boyd retrospective he was preparing for the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Pearce asked Yvonne\u2019s permission. She was adamant she wanted it kept unseen, even going so far as to send a letter to Boyd\u2019s dealers at Australian Galleries \u201cbegging them never to show it\u201d.\nIt was a decision Pearce has always regretted. Now, following Yvonne\u2019s death in 2013, he has finally felt able to reveal the work, \u201ctoo magnificent to keep hidden \u2026 the legacy for us is a real aesthetic triumph\u201d.\nLandscape of the Soul ostensibly surveys the landscapes Boyd loved and painted, starting with the Mornington Peninsula, where he created many of his early works, and ending with Shoalhaven, where he lived out his later years. But it is also, more subtly, about the sway of family and loved ones. For Pearce, who knew Boyd personally for years, it is an ode to friendship.\nBorn in 1920 in Murrumbeena, Victoria, Boyd left school at the age of 14 to work in a factory and to concentrate on his art, attending night classes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. As a teenager he moved in with his grandfather, Arthur Merric Boyd, on the Mornington Peninsula, where he started to paint in earnest.\nMany of his early sketches and works are shown here, revealing a talented young artist who is influenced by the likes of Vincent van Gogh, but has yet to find his feet. Unusually, Pearce has included a painting by Boyd\u2019s mother: 1928\u2019s Figure In A Stormy Landscape. Dark in mood, and loose in brushstroke, there is a magnetic, untamed energy and movement to the work, much like Boyd\u2019s most famous paintings.\n\u201cOf all the creative family Arthur Boyd was fortunate to grow up with \u2026 perhaps the most under-rated influence on him has been his mother Doris,\u201d reads the accompanying text. Doris put aside her art to raise her five children. But she was, according to Pearce, the \u201chidden genius of the family\u201d.\nBoyd\u2019s father, too, left a lasting impression. Merric Boyd, an artist and potter, suffered from epilepsy and debilitating seizures. This was an era when the illness was not fully understood. \u201cThey thought it was a condition where a demonic alter ego inside is released, coming out through sound, through contortion. Like the horror movies: an alien force inside the normal human body,\u201d Pearce explains. \u201cAs a child Arthur asked, \u2018What is the creature inside my father?\u2019 The trauma entered his DNA.\u201d\nIt also entered his paintings, some of which feature great beasts caught by some unseen force. In the Nebuchadnezzar series, a criticism of the Vietnam war, a Babylonian king becomes inflated with his own arrogance and importance. To punish him, God turns him to a madman who is reduced to an animal, walking on his hands and knees, growing his hair long and eating grass.\nWhile the paintings reference everything from the Old Testament to self-immolations in protest of the war, they were also inspired by his father. In Nebuchadnezzar With Blue Flowers And White Dog (1969), a man walks, head and shoulders bent, under a dark blue sky. According to Pearce, it \u201cprojects Merric as the man of sorrows many thought of him\u201d.\nIn Nebuchadnezzar In A Clearing, painted the same year, a giant, overbearing tree that dominates the composition is based on one of Merric\u2019s drawings. A figure lies prostrate on the grass in the rain, apparently after a seizure. As Boyd told Pearce: \u201cI had to paint these things to un-see the trauma.\u201d\nOther demons plagued Boyd, too. \u201cOne was producing commercial shows to sell \u2013 he found it very hard being enslaved to the collectors,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cHe was constantly riven with anxiety.\u201d\nPearce, a former curator of Australian art at the Art Gallery of NSW, often stayed with the Boyds at Bundanon, as did artists including Sidney Nolan and Brett Whiteley. (Whiteley once bent down to do up Boyd\u2019s shoelaces for him. It was, says Pearce, \u201ca gesture of adoration, absolutely \u2026 Arthur was very bemused.\u201d)\nPearce considers his own friendship with Boyd as life changing. When Pearce was just nine months old his father was shot down over Germany in the second world war. Boyd asked him: \u201c\u2018Does it haunt you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018yes it\u2019s haunted me every day of my life that he didn\u2019t come back\u2019.\u201d Boyd instructed Pearce to go and find his father\u2019s grave near Munich. \u201cYou have to be close to his bones,\u201d he said. \u201cYour sense of trauma, your sense of loss \u2013 it helps you un-see it.\u201d\nIn 1981 Boyd said: \u201cI see lovers as victims. They suffer from being unprivate, watched. Love becomes guilt because it is frustrated.\u201d One theme touched on in Landscape of the Soul is persecuted lovers. In 1942 Boyd was conscripted into the Australian army, where he served in the Cartographic Unit. In the first throes of love, he and Yvonne took some army blankets and spent a night in the bush, under the stars.\nThe next day they woke up to see that they had slept precariously close to a crevasse; not only that, but the army charged Boyd with stealing the blankets. The event helped crystallise Boyd\u2019s hatred of the military and what it represented: destruction, death and, on a personal level, an invasion into his life.\nIn 1947-8, reflecting on this, he painted The Expulsion, in which Adam and Eve are driven from the Garden of Eden (in this case the Australian wilderness). The lovers, naked and exposed, flee. Eve covers her private parts with a twig; Adam clutches his head in his hands as a roaring red-headed angel bears down on them. It is a work of great angst and regret, so different to the serene calmness, years later, of the naked Yvonne.\n Arthur Boyd: Landscape of the Soul is open until 9 March at the National Art School, before touring nationally through to 2021",

        "content": "Cardinal Pell is remanded in custody following his conviction for child sexual assault, which judge calls \u2018callous, brazen offending\u2019\nCardinal George Pell, the most senior Catholic cleric ever convicted of child sexual abuse, has been taken in custody following a sentencing hearing in which his lawyer described one of Pell\u2019s offences as a \u201cplain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not actively participating\u201d.\nAfter the hearing, with Pell\u2019s lawyer, Robert Richter, having withdrawn his application for bail, the chief judge said: \u201cTake him away, please.\u201d Pell was taken to a maximum security facility where he will be kept in protective custody and remain alone for up to 23 hours a day.\nHe will be sentenced on 13 March after his conviction for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old boys.\nThe Vatican on Wednesday also said its doctrinal department will open its own investigation into Pell. \u201cAfter the guilty verdict in the first instance concerning Cardinal Pell, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) will now handle the case following the procedure and within the time established by canonical norm,\u201d Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti told reporters. A former US cardinal, Theodore McCarrick, was this month dismissed from the priesthood following a CDF investigation.\nThe former Australian prime minister John Howard was among those who provided character references for Pell as the cardinal\u2019s legal team tried to argue for a lower-end sentence in Melbourne\u2019s county court on Wednesday morning.\nRichter tried to argue there were \u201cno aggravating circumstances\u201d to one of the offences. It was \u201cno more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not actively participating,\u201d he told the court.\nThe chief judge, Peter Kidd, responded: \u201cIt must be clear to you by now I\u2019m struggling with that submission. Looking at your points here \u2013 so what?\u201d\nHe said he saw Pell\u2019s behaviour as \u201ccallous, brazen offending\u201d and \u201cshocking conduct\u201d.\n\u201cHe did have in his mind some sense of impunity. How else did he think he would get away with this? There was an element of force here ... this is not anywhere near the lower end of offending.\u201d\nRichter also tried to suggest that an incident in which Pell grabbed one of the boys by the genitals in an attack that lasted seconds was \u201cfleeting\u201d and not worthy of a jail sentence. Kidd disagreed.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a trifling sexual assault,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNothing is to be gained here by comparing different forms of sexual abuse of children. Of course I need to make a judgement of the overall gravity of this. But there is a limit to these kinds of comparisons.\u201d\nAbuse survivors and advocates present in the court gasped as Richter made his arguments for a lower-end sentence. He said at one point that if Pell\u2019s victims were \u201ctruly distressed\u201d after being abused, they would have returned to their homes exhibiting that distress.\nRichter said he was in a difficult position because he could only propose a sentence based on the jury\u2019s finding of guilt, not on the basis that Pell maintained his innocence. He said Pell did not have a pattern of offending and had not planned the attack, and so would have been \u201cseized by some irresistible impulse\u201d.\nKidd responded: \u201cYou put to the jury only a madman would commit these offences. The jury rejected that. There are no medical records suggesting he is mad. The only inference I can make is that he thought he could get away with it. People don\u2019t go ahead and do what he did without thinking about it. People make choices.\u201d\nProsecutors described Pell as having \u201ca degree of callous indifference\u201d as he \u201chumiliated, degraded\u201d and sexually abused the boys. This offending, prosecutors said, should attract a significant sentence.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nProsecutor Mark Gibson said the offending of Pell was serious, especially given his position of authority at the time.\n\u201cThese acts \u2026 were in our submission humiliating and degrading towards each boy and gave rise to distress in each boy as referred to in the evidence [the complainant] gave. [The victim] recalled voicing objection.\u201d\nHe said Pell\u2019s offending implied \u201ca degree of callous indifference in relation to those objections\u201d.\n\u201cHis state of mind suggests he had some degree of confidence as to the unlikelihood that these two boys would complain,\u201d he said.\nIn response, Richter submitted a book of sentencing arguments to Kidd, which included medical records and character references from high-profile figures including Howard and the president of the Australian Catholic University, Greg Craven. Richter said he could have provided the court with \u201chundreds\u201d of character references for Pell, but had narrowed the list down. All those who gave references knew of Pell\u2019s conviction, he said.\nThe character references spoke of Pell\u2019s kindness and generosity \u201cabove and beyond that of a priest\u201d, of \u201ca man who has a great sense of humour\u201d who relates \u201cto everyone \u201cfrom prime ministers to street cleaners\u201d, Richter said.\nThe hearing was attended by dozens of abuse survivors and advocates, as well as supporters of Pell. The survivors wore badges emblazoned with quotes about child abuse from Pell over the years; \u201cit was not of much interest to me\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s all gossip until it\u2019s proven in a court\u201d.\nPell was found guilty in December of one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16.\nEach conviction carries a maximum jail term of 10 years.\nAt the trial the complainant, now 35, said he and the other choirboy had separated from the choir procession as it exited the church building. He and the other boy sneaked back into the church corridors and entered the priest\u2019s sacristy, a place they knew they should not be. There they found some sacramental wine and began to drink. The complainant alleged that Pell had walked in on them.\nPell then manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. He stepped forward, grabbed the other boy by the back of his head, and forced the boy\u2019s head on to his penis, the complainant told the court. Pell then did the same thing to the complainant, orally raping him. Once he had finished, he ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself.\nA few weeks later Pell attacked the complainant again as he passed him in the church corridor, pushing him against the wall and squeezing his genitals hard through his choir robes, before walking off.\nA victim impact statement from the complainant was submitted by prosecutors at the sentencing hearing. A second impact statement was submitted from the father of the second boy Pell abused. That victim died in 2014 of a drug overdose, when he was 30.\nThere was some argument from Richter as to whether the entirety of the father\u2019s victim impact statement should be submitted, given his statement made in February was \u201cso lacking in proximate impact\u201d to the offending.\nKidd said he would not be swayed by the argument.\n\u201cI think a parent where a child is a victim of a crime \u2026 the impact of the fact of that crime and the distress that would cause to a parent is self-evident and almost inevitable,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cMy view is the parent can stand in as victim in those circumstances.\u201d\nOn Wednesday afternoon Pell\u2019s solicitor Paul Galbally issued a statement saying the bail application had been withdrawn because Pell \u201cbelieves it is appropriate for him to await sentencing\u201d.\n\u201cAn appeal has already been lodged to be pursued following sentencing,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite the unprecedented media coverage, Cardinal Pell has always and continues to maintain his innocence.\u201d",

I don\u2019t know what sort of royal commission he was talking about but it was clearly not one that he properly thought through.\u201d\nMorrison said in-principle support from the states was \u201cvery encouraging\u201d but warned it took the Gillard government two and a half months to set up the child sexual abuse royal commission.\nMorrison said he was working to establish the disability commission before the election, because he believes \u201cwe can get to a terms of reference and letters patent before then\u201d but did not say how much states will be expected to contribute.\nTherese Sands, the co-chief executive of People with Disability Australia and spokeswoman for Disabled People\u2019s Organisations Australia, said the sector would \u201clike to see this up and running as soon as possible\u201d.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the government has begun the process by writing to seek support from states and territories,\u201d she said. \u201cWe urge those states and territories that have not already provided support to do so immediately.\u201d\nQuestions of which level of government paid for the royal commission \u201cshould not get in the way of actually getting started\u201d.\n\u201cPrevious royal commissions have not had to wait for other levels of government to agree to funding, so neither should we,\u201d she said.\nSands called on \u201call governments to put politics aside and to provide the necessary support, funding and resourcing\u201d for the inquiry to \u201cput people with disability first\u201d and \u201cget overdue justice for the violence, abuse and neglect we experience\u201d.\nIn January 2013 the Gillard government set up the royal commission into child sexual abuse with letters patent from all states and territories, but the commonwealth paid the $373m cost of the inquiry over five years.\nAfter the royal commission, the states and territories joined the commonwealth and many of the major churches and charities to fund a redress scheme for victims.\nFederal Labor first called for a disability royal commission in May 2017.\nShorten wrote to state premiers on 22 February, explaining that if elected Labor would establish a broad inquiry \u201cnot just into disability services and the national disability insurance scheme, but also other mainstream services people with disability rely on\u201d, including health, mental health, justice and education.\nShorten said joint letters patent to establish an inquiry would ensure \u201cfull cooperation of the states, without any jurisdictional complexities or constraints\u201d but did not suggest states co-fund it.",

How can there be human dignity?\u201d\nA Senate inquiry is examining the program, which places compulsory participation requirements on about 73,000 people who are receiving parenting payments, have a child between the age of six months and five, and are classified as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d by Centrelink. About 95% of participants are women, and most are single mothers.\nWomen\u2019s groups, non-profit ParentsNext providers and the nation\u2019s peak social services body told the inquiry the government should blunt the harsher aspects of the program before the federal election. It should then be made voluntary, with \u201ccompliance\u201d aspects removed.\nBut department officials defended the program, saying ParentsNext was \u201csupportive and family friendly\u201d.\nNathan Smyth, the deputy secretary of the Department of Jobs and Small Business, said the requirements on participants were \u201cnot onerous\u201d.\nGuardian Australia has revealed that about one in five participants have received a temporary payment suspension, but department officials said 82% of those did not affect the person\u2019s income support because they had \u201cre-engaged\u201d before their money was due.\nThe inquiry also heard claims that participants had been told by their consultants to take photos of themselves to prove their attendance at compulsory activities.\nDepartment officials said such requirements were not part of the guidelines.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d the Greens senator Rachel Siewert said.\nTerese Edwards, the chief executive of the national council for single mothers and their children, told the inquiry one woman had told her she had been signed up, without her consent, to attend medical appointments for her children as her compulsory ParentsNext activity.\nCassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Service Service, told the hearing: \u201cAt the heart of this we are dealing with a level of misogyny and discrimination against women.\u201d\n\u201cThe moralising that goes on about that \u2018kind of lifestyle\u2019 has been in this country for far too long ... It has to stop.\u201d\nThe inquiry heard that the evaluation into an earlier trial into the program did not indicate how many people had been surveyed\u2026\nElla Buckland, a single mother campaigning against the program, presented a petition with more than 30,000 signatures to the Greens senator Rachel Siewert and Labor senator Murray Watt.\n\u201cI started this campaign because access to social security in Australia is not a privilege, it is a human right,\u201d she said.\nSiewert said the inquiry had already heard \u201cdistressing\u201d evidence about the effect on women and their children.\nWatt said the program appeared to exercise \u201ca form of control\u201d on those \u201cwho were trying to escape that in the first place\u201d.\nLabor was examining its position on the program ahead of the election, he said.",

Among other measures, local decrees reviewed by Human Rights Watch proposed measures to hand over lists of allegedly gay and bisexual men to authorities, and change curriculums to teach hatred of LGBT people.\nThe provincial guidelines on explicit music follow recent uproar over a proposed music bill in the national parliament last month, which sought to restrict \u201cnegative foreign influences\u201d.",

And in a one-page letter sent to households in Hungary, Orb\u00e1n said the EU \u201chas not learned anything from the horrible terror attacks of the past years\u201d and \u201cwants to bring even more migrants to Europe\u201d.\nBut Orb\u00e1n\u2019s critics face an uphill battle to expel him from the group. The EPP is Europe\u2019s most powerful political force, with the largest number of seats in the European parliament and nine EU leaders among its ranks.\nCentre-right Nordic and Baltic parties are considering disciplinary action against Fidesz, adding their concerns to Dutch and Luxembourgish parties, which have criticised Orb\u00e1n\u2019s policies in the past.\nPetri Sarvamaa, a Finnish Christian Democrat MEP, told the Guardian that Orb\u00e1n should not be in the EPP. His National Coalition party is considering whether to add its voice to calls for Orb\u00e1n to go.\n\u201cObviously Fidesz led by Orb\u00e1n doesn\u2019t share the values of the EPP. I would go as far and call them an undemocratic force.\u201d The practical consequences of keeping Fidesz inside the EPP were \u201cequally important\u201d as the question of values, said the MEP. \u201cWhat [Fidesz] are trying to do is eating the EPP from the inside. They are like a Trojan horse \u2026 it is clear they are in the process of undermining our party group in the European parliament.\u201d\nIn recent days, German political leaders have also taken a more critical stance, following the launch of the anti-EU poster campaign, which was dismissed by Brussels as \u201ca ludicrous conspiracy theory\u201d.\nAngela Merkel\u2019s successor as leader of Germany\u2019s CDU, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told Der Spiegel last week that it was up to Fidesz to prove it still belonged to the EPP. The CDU could break off contact \u201cit\u2019s no longer possible to come to an understanding,\u201d she said. Merkel reproached Orb\u00e1n by expressing \u201cfull solidarity\u201d with Juncker over the posters and said she would \u201cmake that clear\u201d in discussions with Hungary.\nFrench EPP president Joseph Daul condemned Orb\u00e1n last week for \u201cdeceitful\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d claims against the European commission. Daul has previously said it was better to keep an enfant terrible inside the family.\nDespite the growing anger, many centre-right parties hold with that view, especially in central Europe.\nA source close to the EPP\u2019s parliamentary leader, Manfred Weber, said it was too early to say whether the Bavarian politician would back calls for Fidesz to be kicked out. \u201cThere is growing anger in the EPP family,\u201d the source said, adding: \u201cAs in the past, [Weber] is very much worried about a split, a further division of Europe between east and west.\u201d\nWeber, who aspires to lead the next European commission, issued one of his strongest criticism yet of the Hungarian leader over the poster campaign. \u201cOne cannot belong to the EPP and campaign against the current EPP commission president.\u201d\nSpeaking to journalists last month, the Hungarian government\u2019s chief spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, dismissed suggestions that Fidesz would be forced to leave the EPP. \u201cWe belong there, we are members and our election campaign is going to be in line with the European People\u2019s party.\u201d\nThe procedure to exclude or suspend a political party can be launched by the EPP\u2019s most senior leaders or a joint letter from at least seven parties in five countries.\nAnna Maria Corazza Bildt, a senior MEP in Sweden\u2019s Moderate party, told the Guardian that the EPP had spent 10 years trying to bring Orb\u00e1n into line. \u201cWe see that not only is it not improving but the situation in Hungary is becoming more and more disturbing.\u201d\nShe cited the forced move of the Central European University to Vienna, pressure on independent media and judges, and the \u201cantisemitic tone with the constant demonisation of George Soros\u201d.\n\u201cThe dismantling of the rule of law is happening, we see the erosion of functional democracy. Democracy is not only winning elections, democracy is the checks and balance, the media. We have tried for 10 years in very good faith [to have a dialogue with the Hungarian government] and we don\u2019t see the result. We have to draw the consequences of that.\u201d",

The election turnout was 35.6 percent, the electoral commission said, which compared with 44% in the 2015 presidential election.\n\u201cMuhammadu Buhari of the APC, having satisfied the requirement of the law and scored the highest number of votes is hereby declared the winner,\u201d Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), told election officials and reporters in the early hours of Wednesday.\nBuhari won in 19 states \u2013 including the two most populous, Lagos and Kano \u2013 while Abubakar was victorious in 17.\nTo win in the first round, the victor must get at least a quarter of the votes in two thirds of the states, plus an overall majority, and Buhari appeared to have won enough to avoid a runoff.\nThe victory laugh #BuhariHasWon \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/N0mYiu3qNy\nBashir Ahmad, one of Buhari\u2019s adviser\u2019s, posted on Twitter a picture of the president laughing and with the slogan \u201cBuhariHasWon\u201d.\nA message posted on Buhari\u2019s Twitter feed late on Tuesday showed him smiling and surrounded by applauding staff at his campaign office.\n\u201cI met the very hardworking members of our team, many of them young people, and was briefed on the performance of our party so far in the Presidential Elections. I am very proud of what has been accomplished,\u201d he said on Twitter.\nBut the opposition People\u2019s Democratic party (PDP) rejected the result and threatened to take legal action, saying that the ruling All Progressives\u2019 Congress had manipulated the vote.\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any meeting of the PDP legal team, but I know there are concerns laid to the INEC [electoral commission] chairman , based on promises he made to Nigerians on the conduct of the elections,\u201d Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP spokesman, said. \u201cWhen he addresses those concerns, then we will know what to do.\u201d\nBabatunde Fashola, a minister and the campaign director for election monitoring, told the Associated Press that they were preparing for the president to give his acceptance speech and celebrate. Dozens of supporters began dancing outside party headquarters in Abuja.\nHe said Atiku, who is known by his first name, should accept his loss gracefully and provide evidence to back up claims that the ruling party manipulated the results of Saturday\u2019s vote.\nThe election was delayed at the last minute by a week and, since it was held, 47 people have been killed, according to the monitoring organisation the Situation Room.\nReports of vote-buying, multiple failures with the card readers supposed to accredit voters and extremist attacks in the north east marred the election. Many polling stations opened late and, in some, voting continued on Sunday.\nShortly before the election, Buhari suspended the chief justice Walter Onnoghen, who heads the supreme court and would have ruled on any dispute over the results. The president\u2019s move was widely criticised as a \u201ccalculated attempt to gain some electoral advantage\u201d in the case of a legal challenge.\nAdewunmi Emoruwa of The Election Network said the election fell short of expectations. \u201cThe numbers alone are indicting. We have already witnessed a record number of cancelled votes \u2013 more than double the numbers from the previous poll \u2013 and which is only a reflection of the widespread irregularities across every part of the country. We all observed as thugs had a field day unleashing terror on demographically profiled voters, which led to the suppressed turnout that has been recorded.\u201d\nBuhari and Atiku are both northern Muslims in their 70s who have long been in politics. Buhari is seen by many as a strict, inflexible but personally incorruptible figure, while many hoped Atiku, a wealthy businessman and former vice-president, would enact policies to help boost Nigeria\u2019s struggling economy.\nBuhari\u2019s popularity dropped over the course of his term, because of his perceived inability to deal fairly with government corruption \u2013 he was accused of largely targeting his opponents for prosecutions \u2013 and his failure to deal with the many threats facing Nigerians. The north-east region is especially dangerous, because Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province still wield considerable might.\nIt would be unusual for a presidential election to be won by a candidate not backed by a powerful cabal of former generals that includes former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Ibrahim Babangida.\nBuhari narrowly won Lagos, where only 1.1 million of an estimated 20 million residents voted, as well as the pivotal state of Kano, despite the fact that its powerful ex-governor Rabiu Kwankwaso switched from Buhari\u2019s APC to the PDP last year.",

This is just outrage piled on outrage.\u201d\nLabor has vowed to challenge the changes, but with just one sitting of parliament scheduled before the likely election date, it is running out of time.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t stop it through the parliament, we will make people pay back the money,\u201d Plibersek said. \u201cMembers of parliament should not be using taxpayer funds to run political ads, full stop.\u201d\nHawke accused Labor of \u201copposing the rights of disadvantaged communities\u201d.\n\u201cLabor is a party that lectures us about multinationals, but are opposing changes that take expenditure away from social media giants like Facebook and put it into local Aussie communities,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cLabor is a party that lectures us on climate change action, but are opposing changes that will reduce the amount of printing done by parliamentarians.\n\u201cBy fighting overdue modernisation of the system, Labor have shown that they don\u2019t understand rural and regional Australia and they don\u2019t care about local economies.\u201d\nLast month, documents revealed the government planned to spend $36m before the May federal election advertising its infrastructure spending and income tax package plan.\nScott Morrison, who criticised Labor for its advertising spend in 2013, said last month he believed it was \u201centirely appropriate for Australians to understand what their government is doing\u201d.\nThe then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull oversaw one of the biggest overhauls of electoral spending in 2017.\nAfter a series of scandals, the Turnbull government established an independent parliamentary expenses authority, scrapped the life gold travel pass and introduced a \u201cdominant purpose test\u201d for expenses, meaning public resources could be used only when parliamentary business was the dominant purpose.\nIn the Senate, Cory Bernardi raised the alarm that attempts were being made to amend public funding reforms the government passed last year, which limited public reimbursement for election campaigns to amounts that were actually spent.\nPreviously, any party or independent candidate that received more than 4% of the first preference vote received $2.73 per vote, a system which delivered One Nation $1.7m in taxpayer funds after the 2016 election.\nBernardi said this month there was a push to reverse the changes.\n\u201cSince then there has been a serious agitation across [the ] crossbench by staff members of MPs to have these changes reversed and whilst publicly many will say last year\u2019s decision was a good one, they are advocating behind the scenes for windfall profits,\u201d Bernardi said last week.\n\u201cIt is absolutely wrong they have taken the case strongly to government.

        "content": "Stravinsky\u2019s savage masterpiece was lauded by jazz musicians, inspired countless film scores \u2013 and made Disney dinosaurs dance. What would music be without it?\nThere is a story that Igor Stravinsky went to the New York jazz club Birdland one evening in 1951. Whispers went round that the great composer was in the house. When Charlie Parker came on with his quintet, he didn\u2019t acknowledge Stravinsky in person, but seamlessly quoted The Firebird in his first number, the furiously fast Ko-Ko. Stravinsky was so delighted that he banged his glass on the table, spilling its contents on the people at the table behind. Parker\u2019s musical quote could just as easily have been The Rite of Spring; two years earlier, in Paris, he\u2019d quoted the opening bassoon melody in his solo on Salt Peanuts, acknowledging that he was in the city that gave birth to The Rite at its scandalous premiere in 1913.\nStravinsky\u2019s friend Robert Craft said that The Rite of Spring was the prize bull that inseminated modernism in music and, indeed, its resonances are still being felt by composers over a century after its premiere. A new work by Anna Clyne was performed at the Davos World Economic Forum last month, and it was hard not to hear a homage to the Rite in its taut violence. But the aftershocks of the work are felt beyond the world of classical music, making connections across musical genres and into cinema.\nAlthough Stravinsky dismissed jazz as \u201cmasturbation which doesn\u2019t really go anywhere\u201d, it is undeniable that he and jazz musicians spoke a version of the same language. The Parker anecdote testifies to this, as does the fact that chunks of The Rite of Spring turn up in tracks by Ornette Coleman, Alice Coltrane, Joni Mitchell, Weather Report \u2013 and the Bad Plus arranged the entire work for jazz trio. Beyond jazz, the powerful riffs, extended harmonies and atavistic violence of The Rite have been a trace element in the more adventurous corners of rock music, consciously or not, since the 1960s, from Frank Zappa \u2013 who claimed to have listened to The Rite of Spring \u201cmore than any man in the world\u201d \u2013 to King Crimson and Metallica and even 1990s pop. When Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys sang, in their 1993 single I Wouldn\u2019t Normally Do this Kind of Thing: \u201cI feel like taking all my clothes off, dancing to The Rite of Spring,\u201d it\u2019s more than just a cute rhyme: the single\u2019s cover art shows a circle of young men in pink tops holding hands and dancing around a male Chosen One in a late-20th-century gay reinterpretation of the sacrifice of the chosen girl in the original ballet.\nMy feelings of creeping feminist unease in writing a book on a ballet about the sacrifice of a young woman created by three men - Stravinsky, Nijinsky (the choreographer) and Roerich (the designer and dramaturg) - were at least partly relieved when I came across the Russian folk metal band Arkona and their frontwoman Masha Scream, so named for her \u201cdeath growl\u201d vocal technique. In the song Yarilo, Arkona riffs on the same ancient Russian myth as Stravinsky did in The Rite of Spring. As Masha whirls around the stage draped in the bearskins in which Roerich clothed the old men who watched a girl dance herself to death, she\u2019s about as potent a symbol of female power as can be imagined. I have no idea if Masha knows The Rite of Spring or not, but I like to fancy that she\u2019s taking revenge.\nIf it makes perfect sense for musical iconoclasts to embrace The Rite,Walt Disney is perhaps a less obvious creative bedfellow. Yet it\u2019s because of Disney that for many of us, The Rite of Spring means dinosaurs. Generations of people first experienced the music in tandem with Walt Disney\u2019s prehistoric images from his 1940 animation Fantasia. In 1939, Stravinsky was newly arrived in the US, uprooted by war in Europe. He signed a contract with Disney which paid him the huge sum of US$6,000, money Stravinsky badly needed. Disney\u2019s terms demanded complete freedom to chop up and edit the music of The Rite as he wished, and to associate it with any images that he chose. He made free with the structure of Stravinsky\u2019s work for his dinosaur ballet, cut over a third of the music completely including the final Sacrificial Dance, and reshuffled what was left. Stravinsky claimed to be horrified, but Fantasia brought his music to a whole new audience and kick-started an era in which his music, and The Rite of Spring in particular, became a kind of source book for movie scores.\nWhile so much film music is infused with the essence of The Rite of Spring, some film composers were more explicit in their homages; indeed Stravinsky was known to complain that reaching for his work had become a shortcut solution for those needing to invoke horror and tension. The orchestral slashes from the shower scene in Bernard Herrmann\u2019s score for Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho (1960) wouldn\u2019t exist without the repetitive violence of The Rite. Elmer Bernstein\u2019s score for To Kill a Mockingbird is suffused with Rite references, and who can forget the central scene in Planet of the Apes, with primates on horseback hunting primitive humans in the long grass, Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s score revealing distinct echoes of the whoops and hunting calls of Stravinsky\u2019s chase and fight sections. And then there\u2019s Jaws.\nComposer John Williams wears his love and knowledge of 20th century orchestral music on his sleeve, and The Rite of Spring has remained a fixed point to which he has constantly returned to pay homage. The growling double-bass leitmotif that signals the approaching shark in Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, arguably the most famous few seconds of music in cinema history, is a close cousin of the first dance in The Rite of Spring. And, throughout his Star Wars scores, Williams has returned to the home territory of The Rite. Just listen to The Dune Sea of Tatooine sequence from the original 1977 Star Wars \u2013 and it is still apparent in the 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens, where the Rathtar attack is scored by music that clearly echoes the final \u201cSacrificial Dance\u201d. And the frantic orchestral gestures of the section of The Rite where the chosen one is glorified just before her sacrifice are reproduced in the climactic scene of Jurassic Park (1993). John Williams has returned The Rite to the dinosaurs.\n Phoenix Dance Theatre and the Orchestra of Opera North perform Jeanguy Saintus\u2019s Rite of Spring at Leeds Grand Theatre and tour until 22 March.\n Gillian Moore is director of music at Southbank Centre.

They say food insecurity is strongly linked to poverty caused by austerity and welfare cuts and is driving widening health inequality.\nFood insecurity is generally defined as experiencing hunger, the inability to secure food of sufficient quality and quantity to enable good health and participation in society, and cutting down on food because of a lack of money.\nThe decision, which took campaigners by surprise, was revealed at an informal meeting on Tuesday attended by the DWP, the Office for National Statistics, Public Health England and the Scottish and Welsh governments, as well as a number of food poverty charities.\nMinisters have for years resisted calls to bring England into line with the US and Canada by measuring food insecurity. Critics said this was to avoid shedding unwanted light on the impact of welfare policy and the public health consequences of being unable to eat regularly or healthily.\nThe new measures closely reflect those called for in a private member\u2019s bill being piloted through the Commons by Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck. She welcomed the move but said urgent action to address the causes of hunger was now needed.\n\u201cIt is a real pity that it has taken this long to be enacted, as every single day that has passed has been a day that another person has gone hungry. This positive step forward should not be used as an excuse for government inaction whilst this important data is being gathered,\u201d said Lewell-Buck.\nThe most recent best estimate of UK food insecurity, published by the Food Foundation in 2016 using UN data, suggested that in 2014 more than 8 million people lived in households that struggled to put food on the table, with more than half regularly going a whole day without eating.\nThe DWP will add 10 questions about food buying and eating habits to its annual Family Resources Survey, which will be sent to 20,000 UK households in April. The data will be reported publicly in March 2021. Experts say the findings will help refine understanding of what drives hunger and food insecurity.\nThe questions, which are based on US measures of food insecurity, will ask whether and how often households skipped meals, were unable to afford healthy food and went hungry or lost weight because they did not have enough money to buy sufficient food.\nThe change of direction on measuring food insecurity comes just weeks after Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, conceded that the rollout of universal credit had contributed to an increase in food bank use, reversing previous ministerial claims that the two were not linked.\nThe DWP said: \u201cWe always ensure we use the best possible evidence base for making policy. Building a better understanding of household food needs will help us to ensure we\u2019re targeting support to those who need it most, so we\u2019ve worked closely with stakeholders to develop tools to help us best collect this information.\u201d\nAnna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve known for too long now that a disturbing number of people in the UK don\u2019t have access to enough nutritious food, but our knowledge has been too patchy to identify real solutions. In the fifth-richest economy in the world, that\u2019s a social justice disaster.\u201d\nNiall Cooper, the director of Church Action on Poverty and chair of End Hunger UK, said: \u201cIt was over three years ago that End Hunger UK coalition members first called on the government to \u2018count the hungry\u2019. So we\u2019re delighted, three years later, that food insecurity levels are finally going to be measured regularly.\u201d\nA Food Foundation study last year found almost 4 million children in the UK lived in households that would struggle to afford to buy enough fruit, vegetables, fish and other healthy foods to meet official nutrition guidelines.",

        "content": "Gap in life expectancy in Britain has widened since onset of austerity, says Michael Marmot\nHigher taxation for the rich may need to be considered if the UK is to tackle the decline in life expectancy in parts of the UK and the widening gap in health inequalities, according to Sir Michael Marmot, the country\u2019s leading authority on the issues.\nTen years on from his seminal review for the Labour government of health inequality in England in 2010, Marmot will publish a review of what has been achieved and the current state of the nation with the Health Foundation. The evidence is expected to show that initial progress faltered and then stopped under the pressure of austerity, Marmot told the Guardian in an interview.\nIn 2015, Marmot\u2019s research showed the expected life of a one-year-old child living in one of the poorest areas could be on average more than eight years shorter than a child in the most affluent 10% of the country.\nWhen the Marmot review was published in 2010, Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government welcomed it and the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government that took over in May published a white paper, promising to put health inequalities at the heart of its public health strategy.\n\u201cBut then the actions that were taken nationally were all to do with austerity,\u201d Marmot told the Guardian. \u201cAnd that meant cutting funding to local government. In turn local government had less money and was closing children\u2019s Sure Start centres. It meant capping welfare payments and reduction of tax credits and the harshness of universal credit.\u201d\nHanding public health to local authorities was an opportunity, he said. His review recommended action in early child development, education, employment and minimum income, and in creating a healthy and sustainable environment \u2013 many of which were local authority responsibilities.\n\u201cThe context for action on the social determinants of health in England has been difficult,\u201d he says in a blog for the Health Foundation. \u201cThe government\u2019s stated priority has been fiscal rectitude \u2013 austerity.\n\u201cIt may be predicted that cuts in funding to local government, schools and social care, as well as an unfavourable climate for benefits, will take their toll on health and health inequalities. The failure of NHS funding to rise in accord with historical trends won\u2019t help.\u201d\nSome local authorities have championed change \u2013 notably Coventry, which has declared itself a \u201cMarmot city\u201d and is now in the process of assessing what it has achieved over the years. Manchester and Liverpool are also actively working on health inequalities.\nBut, said Marmot, a change in approach by central government is also needed. And he thinks there is now public support for some reform of taxation. He cited Dutch historian Rutger Bregman, who caused a sensation at Davos by challenging billionaires who he said could solve inequalities by paying more tax. It was \u201ctaxes, taxes, taxes, and all the rest is bullshit in my opinion\u201d, Bregman said.\n\u201cIn the US, the majority of the population think that rich people should pay more tax,\u201d Marmot told the Guardian. \u201cThe argument that having a higher marginal rate of tax at some higher level of income I think is very strong.\n\u201cThe evidence suggests very rich people when their marginal rate at the top gets high enough they stop paying themselves so much \u2013 they reinvest in their companies. It\u2019s why [American politician] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recommended a 70% marginal rate above incomes of $10m.\n\u201cI think the economists who\u2019ve looked at this suggest you don\u2019t get a drop in productivity or innovation at those top levels so thinking about more progressive taxation schemes that would be good for everybody. Even in the United States, this is no longer on the left fringe.\u201d\nThe review is a collaboration between Marmot\u2019s Institute for Health Equity and the Health Foundation. It plans a \u201cdeep dive\u201d analysis of key areas including early years and education, work and income and housing, places, and communities. It will be published in February 2020, exactly 10 years after the original.\n\u201cThe original Marmot review was a landmark study, revealing the shocking scale of the health gap between the best and worst off in England,\u201d said Tim Elwell-Sutton, assistant director of strategic partnerships at the Health Foundation.\n\u201cAlthough there has been progress in some areas since 2010, health inequalities are still widening and improvements in life expectancy are stalling. A flourishing society, ready to face the future, will only be possible if we understand what\u2019s driving these trends and what can be done to reverse them.\u201d",

        "content": "London, Leeds, Doncaster and Maidstone are among the worst affected\nAlmost 2,000 locations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland have levels of air pollution that exceed safety limits, according to a pollution map released by campaigners.\nIn 2017, the worst location for nitrogen dioxide pollution was Kensington and Chelsea, followed by Leeds and Doncaster.\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the most harmful pollutant gases, irritating the lungs and potentially causing breathing difficulties. Road traffic is a leading source.\nOn Tuesday the mayor of London issued a high pollution alert for the capital as people across the UK basked in the unseasonably warm February weather. It was the first alert since last July, towards the end of a long heatwave and dry spell.\nTraffic and other emissions from local sources were mainly to blame for this week\u2019s dirty air, with only light winds to disperse them and air from the continent bringing further pollutants.\nIn April the first ultra-low emission zone will come into force in central London. The scheme is expected to cut harmful emissions by as much as 45%, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said high levels of particulate matter in the air were also recorded in the past few days in the East and West Midlands. Other regions were also expected to experience localised pollution in hotspots, carrying on at least into Wednesday.\nThe new map of nitrogen dioxide pollution limit breaches for recent years shows that Earl\u2019s Court station in London was worst overall, with a recording of 129.5 micrograms per cubic metre, compared with the 40\u03bcg/m3 limit set out in the government\u2019s air quality objectives.\nA monitoring station near the Ikea store in Brent, north London, recorded levels slightly above 100\u03bcg/m3 in 2016, while Kensington High Street, Euston Road and Strand in central London were all above 90\u03bcg/m3 in 2017.\nAir near Neville Street in Leeds was found to be just under the 100\u03bcg/m3 level, closely followed by two locations in Hickleton, Doncaster. Other hotspots included Brighton, Sheffield and Coventry, where the levels on Holyhead Road were found to be near twice the advised limit, at about 76\u03bcg/m3 in 2016.\nFriends of the Earth, which mapped the sites and collated the data, said it was further evidence of the dire air quality across the country as a result of burgeoning traffic emissions and poor government controls on emissions sources. The group called for tougher action by ministers.\nSimon Bowens, a clean air campaigner at FoE, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable that across the UK there are nearly 2,000 locations over air quality limits, leaving millions of us breathing dangerously polluted air. The government needs to step up and do more to help deal with this air pollution crisis. They can\u2019t just carry on leaving the difficult decisions with local authorities, many of which are severely under-resourced.\u201d\nHe said the map showed that air pollution was not just a problem for big cities. \u201cUnacceptably toxic air can be found across much of the UK, even in smaller towns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is harming the health of people across the country and is especially bad for young children whose lungs are still developing.\u201d\nAir pollution is known to shorten lives and reduce the quality of life for tens of thousands of people, and in recent studies it has also been linked to health problems from dementia to heart disease and miscarriage. Children are most at risk: exposure to air pollution when young can have lifelong effects as it can stunt the lungs and affect intelligence.\nA fresh inquest into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old from south London, is expected to be asked to consider whether her death six years ago from an asthma-related seizure could have been linked to high levels of air pollution.\nThe data used for the map was taken from the most recent annual air quality status reports that have been submitted to government, most of them from last year, with the results adjusted for distance and other factors.\n This article was amended on 27 February 2019 to make it clear that the data in the analysis covered England, Wales and Northern Ireland, rather than the entire UK.",

As many as three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30 \u2013 despite barely a third of the workforce being in this age bracket.\nDaniel Tomlinson, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cLife has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed \u2013 and for longer, too.\n\u201cWhile policymakers can\u2019t reverse major and long-lasting changes in how we shop, they can and should focus on the people and places most affected.\u201d\nAlthough job losses in the retail sector appear to have risen in recent years, the study found there had been a long-term shift away from retail employment in the economy since 2003.\nThe report said the number of jobs in the sector had shrunk as a share of the overall UK workforce from 10.8% to 9.5%, equivalent to 320,000 missing positions.\n\u201cBritain, far from being a \u2018nation of shopkeepers\u2019, now has a lower share of workers in wholesale and retail than Germany,\u201d it said.\nDespite repeated rounds of job losses, more than enough roles have opened up in other areas to compensate, particularly in hospitality and social care, although the rise in the redundancy rate poses fresh challenges.\nThe report also said retail continued to be a low-paying sector, with the typical hourly wage \u2013 \u00a38.80 \u2013 about a third lower than typical pay across the entire economy of \u00a312.73.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the news you can use this Wednesday morning.\nMichael Cohen is to call Donald Trump \u201ca racist\u201d, a \u201cconman\u201d and a \u201ccheat\u201d in his testimony to Congress, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by the New York Times. The president\u2019s one-time lawyer, who will appear before a House committee later today, will claim that Trump knew during his presidential campaign that Roger Stone was talking to Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails. According to the leaked statement, Cohen will add: \u201cNever in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for president, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said \u2018yes\u2019 to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.\u201d You can find out more about the Cohen statement and follow all the reaction and developments at our live blog.\nThe sensational development came hours after Trump arrived in Hanoi for his second summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The US president is scheduled to hold a one-on-one with Kim at 11.30GMT today.\nIt was a busy night elsewhere in US politics. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly against Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency at the US-Mexico border. The measure will now go to the Republican-led Senate where only a handful of defections could result in a stinging rebuke to the president\u2019s prestige. And congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says Ivanka Trump can\u2019t criticise the Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal jobs plan because she has never had to \u201cwork for wages\u201d.\nRemainer revolt \u2013 Theresa May has agreed to give MPs a vote on delaying Brexit after bowing to pressure from pro-remain cabinet ministers. In a move that has incensed pro-Brexit Tories, the prime minister was forced to give ground after a stormy cabinet meeting which saw Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd urge her to seek an extension to the Brexit trigger of article 50 or face mass resignations from the frontbench. The next meaningful vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal will now be held by 12 March, she told the Commons. If it is defeated again, it will be followed by a vote on 13 March on leaving with no deal. If that is defeated there will then be a vote the next day for an extension to article 50. Amid the swirl of manoeuvres at Westminster, an official government report has revealed that the UK economy could shrink by 9% in the event of a no-deal Brexit and also result in higher food prices. And Rafael Behr writes in his column this morning that the likely extension of article 50 shows more clearly than ever that there will never be a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d of the kind dreamed about by leavers.\nFatal stabbing \u2013 A man has been stabbed to death at Ilford station in east London in the fifth fatal knife attack in the capital in the past nine days. The victim, believed to be in his 20s, was attacked at around 8.30pm last night. The Metropolitan police have launched a murder inquiry but no arrests have yet been made. It follows recent stabbing deaths in Camden, Brixton, Wood Green and Tower Hamlets.\nFood for thought \u2013 The threat of higher grocery prices post-Brexit is thrown into even sharper focus by our exclusive story about a government plan to introduce a food security index to measure how often low-income families skip meals or go hungry. The reform has been demanded by anti-poverty campaigners for several years and aims to gather a more accurate picture of the extent and causes of hunger in the UK.\nOff track \u2013 Britain\u2019s long-suffering rail passengers are paying the price of costly mismanagement by the Department of Transport, according to damning report by MPs published today. Travellers faced another \u201cdifficult year\u201d beset by more timetable changes and engineering work, the public accounts committee warns, and lays the blame on \u201cstrategic mismanagement\u201d by the DoT. It follows \u201cunacceptable levels of disruption\u201d last year that prompted transport secretary Chris Grayling to order a review chaired by former British Airways boss Keith Williams. Increasing pressure on the department, Williams made a speech on Tuesday night arguing that the current franchise system \u201ccannot continue the way it is today\u201d.\nPell plea \u2013 George Pell\u2019s lawyer has dismissed one of the disgraced cardinal\u2019s offences as a \u201cplain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not actively participating\u201d. Robert Richter told a pre-sentencing hearing in Melbourne today that there were \u201cno aggravating circumstances\u201d to the case as he tried to secure bail for his client. However, the application was withdrawn and the Australian cardinal will now go straight to jail. Pell, the most senior Catholic priest in the world to be found guilty of child sexual abuse, has also been sacked as the Vatican\u2019s finance chief after the Melbourne court\u2019s verdict was revealed on Tuesday.\nTail of the unexpected \u2013 There\u2019s only place to end our roundup of the news this morning \u2013 Bensheim in Germany, where firefighters have rescued a rat so fat that it became stuck in a manhole cover. The rodent, plumped up by winter feeding according to animal rescuers, was pictured with its mouth open as if screaming for help after it managed to get trapped in the metal grate. It took a multi-agency effort to set it free.\nThe Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh and Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan explore whether the European Research Group is as influential as ever \u2013 or has it overplayed its hand on Brexit? Plus: Joanna Walters on the Sackler family and the US opioid crisis\nThe next time the small people in your life ask if they can have one of those cute little French bulldogs as a pet, you might want to show them this article about the sometimes cruel truth behind the trend for such brachycephalic breeds. In case you didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s the fancy name for flat-faced dogs whose popularity has soared thanks to owners (and wannabe owners) putting their pictures on social media. But while many people coo at the pics, the veterinary industry is fretting that the demand means the entrnchment of the breathing and eating problems common among \u201cbrachys\u201d. One campaigner, Linda Goodman, says the fashion is \u201ccrucifying\u201d the breeds. \u201cPeople are still so set on having them that it kind of bypasses them that they are buying into cruelty,\u201d she says.\nLeicester\u2019s new manager Brendan Rodgers ran the rule over his new charges as they secured their first home win since Boxing Day thanks to goals by Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy. Maurizio Sarri has threatened to drop Kepa Arrizabalaga for Wednesday\u2019s home game against Tottenham for the collective good of the Chelsea squad and has no regrets over losing his cool during the Carabao Cup final. Duanne Olivier is giving up a Test cricket career with South Africa \u2013 or a least placing it in cold storage \u2013 to sign a three-year deal at Yorkshire via the Kolpak ruling. Joe Root, on the eve of the fourth ODI against West Indies, has declined the option to rest for the three-match Twenty20 series that ends this Caribbean tour. Wales have suffered a blow to their hopes of securing the grand slam with news that the lock Cory Hill will miss the remainder of the Six Nations because of an ankle injury. And trainer Paul Nicholls paraded a dozen big-meeting contenders in the sunshine on Tuesday as he revealed that Frodon is now only 50-50 to go for the Gold Cup.\nThe retail industry has the highest redundancy rate of any sector of the British economy, a study says, as store closures at M&S, Debenhams and HMV take their toll. After a strong day for the pound yesterday in the wake of all that talk about delaying Brexit, sterling has been pretty flat overnight at $1.325 and \u20ac1.164. The FTSE100 is set to start the day down slightly.\nIt\u2019s almost entirely Brexit news on the front pages today. The Times reports: \u201cCabinet war as MPs get chance to delay Brexit\u201d, while the FT says: \u201cMay opens way for \u2018short\u2019 Brexit delay to appease pro-EU Tories\u201d and the i has: \u201cMay hits the pause button on Brexit\u201d. The Telegraph has a report that cabinet ministers have told May \u201cDelaying Brexit is \u2018a plot to stop it\u2019\u201d.\nThe Mail reports on the prime minister\u2019s speech to Commons: \u201cMay: now do your duty\u201d, as does the Express, which highlights May\u2019s reference to the meerkat from the Comparethemarket TV advertisement: \u201cBrexit? It\u2019s \u2018simples\u2019 ... back my deal\u201d. The Guardian has: \u201cGovernment: no-deal Brexit may cut UK economy by 9%\u201d.\nIn other news, the Sun reports on a deportation case: \u201cBrute farce\u201d about a deportation case and the Mirror has a story about criminals who are being monitored by probation contractors killing more than 200 people: \u201cContract killers\u201d.\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Until now it has been used only for novelty gifts, but the company said it was in talks with wine manufacturers and suppliers about producing the bottles on a much larger scale.\nMade from recycled PET, the bottle has a plastic cap, making recycling easier. It takes up 40% less space and is 87% lighter than conventional bottles.\nThe company\u2019s carton for 10 flat bottles, being launched at a packaging conference in Birmingham on Wednesday, would hold only four glass bottles of the same 75cl volume.\nSantiago Navarro, the chief executive and co-founder of Gar\u00e7on Wines, said normal wine cases resulted in \u201cunnecessarily costly logistics, excessive packaging, wasted resources and a grotesque carbon footprint. This is because the bottles being used are not fit for purpose in a 21st-century world of e-commerce, complex supply chains and, most importantly, climate change.\u201d\nA pallet loaded with flat bottle cases could carry 1,040 bottles of wine, compared with 456 round bottles.\nNavarro said the recycled plastic used for the bottles was safe and did not affect the taste. The company said it used technology that reduced the ingress of oxygen into the bottles for about a year.\nExtrapolating figures from a study by the government\u2019s waste advisory body Wrap, an 87% weight saving in a wine bottle would reduce carbon emissions by more than 500g per bottle.",

        "content": "A new craft-brew fest underlines Manchester\u2019s ascendant beer scene, where innovative brewers and great venues meet\n Top 10 Manchester pubs\nBeer fans will head to Manchester for Cloudwater\u2019s first Friends & Family festival, from 1-2 March, which is putting the spotlight on a city where craft-beer tourism is booming. And aside from the festival, each weekend visitors can tour a walkable collection of brew-taps and brewery-owned city-centre bars \u2013 and drink some of Britain\u2019s best beer. Here is your essential guide.\nIt is difficult to make an industrial railway arch unit cosy but, near Victoria station, owner Mark Welsbyhas transformed Runaway\u2019s split-level space of pallets and trestle tables into a laid-back nook that\u2019s ideal for lingering \u2013 despite the fact you\u2019re drinking from plastic glasses overlooking a working brewery. There is moody lighting, board games, beer skittles, interesting music and a few subtly eccentric decorative flourishes. Eight keg taps are augmented by bottles to drink-in/takeaway. Do not miss the Tropical Crush double IPA (DIPA) and the modern Manchester classic, Runaway\u2019s IPA. Made with an unusually dark crystal malt, it is a beer of rare depth. Brewery tours available.\n Pint from \u00a34.20, therunawaybrewery.com\nMarble Brewery\u2019s Marble Arch is one of northern England\u2019s most famous pubs: a gorgeous 19th-century tiled masterpiece. Less well known is that Marble also owns a second tap-house in the Northern Quarter. Originally a rather awkward one-room bar with a single communal table, Thomas Street has blossomed into two buzzy floors of nattily designed drinking space. The legendary likes of Marble\u2019s Lagonda, Early Grey IPA and Dobber beers are joined by select guests (Magic Rock, Squawk, etc). Head upstairs for Marble\u2019s cask ales, which may include Pint, its 3.9% stroke of dry, hoppy genius.\n Pint from \u00a33.40, marblebeers.com\nA stone\u2019s throw from the traffic of Great Ancoats Street, this brewery tap has a Zen-like calm. Ornamental plants decorate a minimalist, Scandi-style pale-wood interior, while tasteful electronica burbles away discreetly. It is a space as design-conscious as Cloudwater\u2019s artwork; large versions of which are displayed on-site. Cloudwater is zealous about freshness and Unit 9\u2019s 20 taps pour beers kegged and served within seven days from a 3C cold-store. Everything is served in set third, half and two-third measures (no pints), which will irk some people \u2013 as may the controversial decision to make Unit 9 cashless and card-only. On the upside, the flat \u00a33.50 pricing makes this one of the cheaper places to experience Cloudwater\u2019s exceptional but notoriously expensive beers. Unit 9 also hosts irregular tap-takeovers with similarly cutting-edge breweries (Verdant, Against The Grain).\n Beers \u00a33.50, cloudwaterbrew.co\nA world away from the sometimes oppressive reverence of the geekiest craft bars, Seven Bro7ther\u2019s Ancoats tap is a looser, friendlier, frequently packed proposition. For all its light hipster stylings (a lot of rough-hewn planks and filament lightbulbs), fundamentally this is a big unpretentious boozer, which happens to sell unusually good beer. The tap selection includes guest beers from breweries as diverse as 4T\u2019s and Gipsy Hill but naturally the Salford brewery\u2019s beers dominate. Its stout and keg IPA are dependable drops.\n Pint from \u00a33.80, sevenbro7hers.com\nLess of a destination than when GRUB ran its street-food events here, this newly revamped brewery-tap (out goes communal seating in comes heaters) remains an essential stop-off on any Manchester crawl; if only to try Alphabet\u2019s oatmeal-spiked pale ale, A To The K. In the warren of railway arch units around Piccadilly station, the brewery is jazzily decorated with the fever-dream graphic art that designer Nick Hamilton creates for Alphabet\u2019s, at times, equally out-there beers (for example, Carry On Crampus cranberry bock; You\u2019re So Vain salted caramel imperial stout). Alphabet has recently gone down the no-pints, card-only route. Two-third schooners are now its largest serve. Over summer, expect music and street food one-offs in the courtyard.\n Two-thirds from \u00a32.60, @ABCtaproom\nUnusually colourful (its orange banquettes and Perspex back-bar give it a look of a 1980s Top of the Pops set), this Dale Street tap-house serves a mix of quality guest beers (Wild Beer, Mikeller, Burning Sky), and Beatnikz\u2019 hop-forward brews, such as I Smash Citra and Generation IPA. The weekday cask ale deals are notable (recently pie \u2018n\u2019 a pint \u00a35, Mon/Tues), as is Beatnikz\u2019s ability to bag high-profile guests for its meet-the-brewer events. For instance Arbor Ales and US star Modern Times.\n Pint from \u00a33.70, beatnikzrepublic.com\nFurnished with old sofas and salvaged fireplace surrounds, this homely take on the railway arch brew-tap has emerged as an affable, community hub for local beer geeks. It\u2019s a little further out into Ardwick, and variously hosts the Manchester branch of the Mikkeller Running Club and irregular events, such as home-brew meets and themed tastings. Owner Steve Dunkley is fascinated by historic and unusual brewing recipes and usually has one gravity-dispensed or barrel-aged curveball on each week. Regulars swear by his Peterloo porter, a dark beer for all seasons.\n Pint from \u00a33, beernouveau.co.uk\nEach summer, Blackjack Brewery throws open its railway arch doors for a series of brew-taps. On a warm evening, sat under the courtyard\u2019s DIY pergola, eating astonishingly good Neapolitan pizza from Honest Crust, as a range of diverting DJs spin, it is one of the city\u2019s best off-piste industrial hideaways. Out of season, you can also drink Blackjack\u2019s beers (timeless hoppy cask pales, such as New Deck, out-there creations like the jasmine tea saison Dragon\u2019s Tears), at its pub, the Smithfield. A stripped-back, low-frills bolthole serving forward-thinking beers, it is perfect.\n Pint from \u00a33.80, @TheSmithfieldNQ\nAnother tap that may irritate traditionalists (no cash, card-only; no pints, two-third schooners only) but, in other ways, this temporary space on the third-floor of the mid-renovation Crusader Mill is a charmer. Behind Piccadilly station, finding it is an adventure in itself and having made that pilgrimage the beer-lovers at its communal tables seem happy to be here \u2013 and not just those larking about on the ping-pong table. The room has a good feel. From Track\u2019s sensational beers (nine keg taps, plus select bottles), try that New England-style juice bomb Going To The Sun and Sonoma, a 3.8% pale ale that packs a remarkable flavour punch.\n Two-thirds from \u00a32.50, trackbrewing.co\nOn Oxford Road, the shipping-container bar and nano-brewery, \u00d6l, is doing arresting things in the realm of wild foraged saisons and milkshake IPAs (@olbrewerybar; card-only). Several other Manchester breweries, mainly in Ancoats and Ardwick, also open for sporadic brew-tap events from spring. Keep an eye on Wander Beyond and Manchester Brewing Co, which has \u201csome new big shiny kit going in\u201d it will unveil over the May and August bank holiday weekends. The consistently brilliant Pomona Island Brew Co will open a regular tap at its Salford Quays brewery this summer, as well as throwing its now annual Manchester Beer Week boat party, launching from city-centre bar, Gas Lamp, where Pomona beers are always available (dates tbc).",

I have always found him to be lacking hypocrisy and cant. In his chosen vocation he has frequently displayed much courage and held to his values and beliefs, irrespective of the prevailing wisdom of the time.\u201d\nHoward said Pell was a \u201clively conversationalist who maintains a deep and objective interest in contemporary social and political issues.\u201d\nIn a radio interview on Wednesday afternoon, Abbott revealed he spoke to Pell on Tuesday but refused to say what he had said to the now convicted child molester.\n\u201cYes, Ben, I spoke to him yesterday,\u201d Abbott told 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham during an at-times combative interview. \u201cIt was a call that I put into him. Yes I called him.\u201d\nIt was the first time Abbott has spoken about the guilty verdict handed to his long-standing friend. Abbott has previously described Pell as a \u201cfine man\u201d and a \u201cfine human being and a great churchman\u201d who may not be \u201cperfect\u201d.\nAbbott began Wednesday\u2019s interview by describing the verdict as \u201cdevastating\u201d. Fordham asked Abbott for whom it was devastating, prompting the reply: \u201cCertainly, for the friends of Cardinal Pell, and as you say, I am one.\n\u201cDevastating for all who believe in the Catholic church, and I\u2019m also one of those.\n\u201cThis is a grim time, no doubt about that. But, as I said, I also have faith in our system of justice and let\u2019s see what the system of justice ultimately produces.\u201d\nHe repeatedly refused to say whether he would continue to count Pell as a friend and supporter should the cardinal lose the appeal against his conviction.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a hypothetical question, Ben. Let\u2019s see where we go,\u201d he said.\nAbbott said he accepted the court\u2019s decision and described the crimes as \u201chorrific\u201d, but repeatedly pointed to the need to wait for the appeal process to be settled.",

        "content": "Chris Williamson booked room in parliament to screen film about suspended activist\nThe Labour MP, Chris Williamson, faces a dressing-down from party officials after he helped to arrange a screening in parliament of a film defending Jackie Walker, the activist suspended from the party over comments about antisemitism.\nA Labour spokeswoman said it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d for the Derby North MP to have booked a room in parliament next Monday for a screening of the film, entitled Witch Hunt.\nLabour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, and the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, are to contact Williamson to stress their displeasure at his actions and ensure he cancels the booking.\nLuciana Berger, the Jewish MP who quit Labour over its handling of anti-semitism, wrote on Twitter of the video: \u201cThis is what I have left behind. It\u2019s toxic. Our country deserves so much better. ChangePolitics\u201d.\nIt comes as footage emerged of Williamson telling a meeting that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d over antisemitism.\nAddressing Sheffield Momentum, Williamson said Labour had been \u201cdemonised\u201d over the issue. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible for that. Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d\nThe action by Brown and Formby follows complaints to the party hierarchy from Labour MPs, including the deputy leader, Tom Watson, Lilian Greenwood and Ruth Smeeth.\nThe screening was to be hosted by Jewish Voice for Labour, a small pro-Corbyn party organisation that rejects the idea that Labour has an issue with antisemitism.\nWitch Hunt takes a sceptical look at claims that Labour has experienced a problem with some antisemitic behaviour under Corbyn\u2019s leadership, focusing particularly on the case of Walker, who has been suspended from the party for more than two years.\nWalker was initially suspended after she wrote about Jewish people as \u201cfinanciers of the sugar and slave trade\u201d, but was then reinstated. She was suspended again in September 2016 after saying she had not found a definition of antisemitism she could work with, and questioning why Holocaust Memorial Day was not more wide-ranging. She is reportedly facing a party hearing next month.\nA Labour spokeswoman said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate to book a room for an event about an individual who is suspended from the party and subject to ongoing disciplinary procedures. This falls below the standards we expect of MPs.\u201d\nAntisemitism was cited as among the reasons for leaving Labour by several MPs who quit the party for the Independent Group last week, among them Luciana Berger and Ian Austin.\nWatson tweeted that he had reported his concerns to Brown and Formby. He also said in response to a tweet about Williamson\u2019s \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d statement: \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to conclude that his behaviour is deliberately inflammatory.\u201d\nGreenwood said she planned to complain about Williamson, who has previously said accusations of antisemitism in the party were being made \u201cfor political ends\u201d. \u201cHe seems to be very deliberately sticking two fingers up at the Jewish community and his colleagues,\u201d Greenwood told the Guardian.\nSmeeth told Jewish News, which first reported the planned event, that Williamson was assisting \u201can organisation that seems more intent on characterising the antisemitism crisis within the party as smears rather than being part of the solution\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cGiving these people and Jackie Walker a platform at the home of British democracy is a complete and utter disgrace. I\u2019ll be complaining to the leader of the Labour party and the house authorities.\u201d\nWilliamson told the Guardian that he had only booked the room and was not hosting the event and did not plan to attend the screening.\nThe maker of the film, Jon Pullman, said it sought to examine the \u201cwider historical context\u201d of accusations about antisemitism on the left and treated the claims against Walker as \u201cmischievous\u201d.\nWilliamson had booked the room after attending the premiere of the film in east London last week, Pullman added.",

        "content": "From the easing of sanctions to denuclearisation and ending the Korean war, there\u2019s a lot to play for in Hanoi \nDonald Trump has said that when he meets Kim Jong-un in Hanoi\u2019s Metropole Hotel on Wednesday evening, the potential for a deal is \u201cawesome\u201d.\nFew would argue with that. A move to limit the North Korean arsenal and begin to re-integrate the country back into the international community, would be a significant step away from the brink of nuclear war.\nIf the past is any guide, Trump will declare the meeting a brilliant triumph whatever happens, especially at a time he knows that any news from Hanoi will be sharing a split-screen with his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, saying devastating things about the president.\nTrump\u2019s character, his past eagerness to please despots, and his political difficulties at home have raised alarm that he may give away significant concessions in Vietnam, and thereby surrender US leverage over North Korea.\nAn account of a draft agreement published by Vox has added to those concerns. It suggested that the US would loosen sanctions in return for vague promises to shut down its main plutonium-producing reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which produces plutonium.\nAccording to this account, the specific details about the closure would be delegated to working groups, allowing North Korea to procrastinate as international pressure waned.\nThe Vox account has not been confirmed and both Trump and Kim are fond of surprises. Trump took to Twitter as he awaited their evening meeting to warn against trying to second guess what he was going to do.\n\u201cAll false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to North Korea,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cKim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on Denuclearization & then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse.\u201d\nWhat will count is whether the Hanoi meeting succeeds in adding substance to the largely rhetorical outcome of the first summit, in Singapore in June. There the two leaders agreed to the \u201cdenuclearization of the Korean peninsula\u201d but interpreted the phrase in very different ways.\nTrump presented it as Kim\u2019s pledge to disarm, while Kim was simply repeating a North Korean catchphrase which refers to a vaguely defined, long term process of multilateral disarmament, during which Pyongyang would be freed of constraints and recognised as a nuclear weapons power.\nTrump\u2019s extravagant claims distracted from the positive outcomes from Singapore. North Korea\u2019s moratorium on nuclear and missile testing endured. Facilities have been dismantled at a missile engine test facility and a tunnel demolished a nuclear test site.\nFurthermore, a Stanford University assessment concluded that while North Korea was continuing to make fissile material for more bombs, it had slowed down its work on weaponisation \u2013 designing and building warheads.\n\u201cOur findings indicate that the latter outweighs the former, resulting in an overall decreased threat,\u201d the Stanford authors said.\nMeanwhile, the South Korean government has been pursuing its own talks with Kim that have resulted in a significant decrease in tensions, including concrete protocols to reduce the chance of an accident or miscalculation leading to war.\nThe challenge in Hanoi is much tougher \u2013 not just to improve the atmosphere but to put the escalation and nuclear armament of the past decades into reverse. That would involve limiting and beginning to draw down the North Korean arsenal (thought to amount to a few dozen warheads), to agree a way to verify disarmament, and to begin to lift sanctions.\nThese are some of the elements likely to figure in any Trump-Kim agreement in Hanoi. They will either reflect its substance or be conspicuous by their absence.\nThe nuclear weapons programme\nSo far the pause in nuclear and missile testing is voluntary and informal. The US will seek to lock in a no-testing pledge as part of an agreement.\nThe nuclear complex at Yongbyon will be the most important bargaining chip on the table. Kim has told the South Koreans he was ready to shut down the 5 megawatt reactor there, that is the source of North Korea\u2019s plutonium. It is also its main source of tritium, which is required to build thermonuclear, or \u2018hydrogen\u2019 bombs.\nThe reactor is being in operation more than 30 years old and approaching obsolescence. North Korea would still be able to make nuclear warheads with highly enriched uranium, and it could have a secret reactor elsewhere. But a real and verified disabling and shutdown of the reactor would be a very concrete step in the direction of disarmament.\nYongbyon is also the site of an uranium enrichment plant. Disabling and dismantling it would be another major achievement. The US believe there are other covert plants elsewhere, and will want those to be on the negotiating table too, perhaps at a later stage.\nMissiles\nThe US is seeking limits on the production of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the continental US, and wants the existing ICBMs dismantled. This would be of limited comfort to US allies in the region who are within shorter range.\nVerification\nAny arms control agreement does not amount to much without a way of demonstrating that disarmament has taken place.\nAt a minimum, North Korea is expected to allow outside inspection of the missile and nuclear test sites it has already started dismantling.\nAllowing international inspectors, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in particular, back into Yongbyon, would be a much more significant step.\nSanctions\nThe US has signalled it is ready to relax its insistence that no sanctions will be lifted until North Korea disarms. It has hinted instead at a phased approach by which some restrictions will be lifted in tandem with steps taken by Pyongyang.\nThe administration\u2019s hands are tied on many US sanctions which are congressionally mandated, but it could persuade the UN security council to relax some international measures, perhaps allowing the expansion of trade and investment between South and North Korea.\nUS military posture\nIn Singapore, Trump surprised US allies by announcing a suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea. That may well be extended in return for the North Korean moratorium on testing.\nA more significant step would be if Trump announced in Hanoi that he was going to draw down the US troop presence in South Korea. That would ring alarm bells in Congress and in Seoul, particularly if it is done without consulting allies.\nBilateral relations\nIt is generally expected that the US and North Korea will take a step towards reestablishing diplomatic relations by setting up liaison offices in each other\u2019s capitals.\nExpect to see further progress on the repatriation of the remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean War.\nA more substantial step would be a declaration calling an end to hostilities which dated by to 1950 and the outbreak of the Korean war. It was only suspended three years later with an armistice, but no peace treaty. A declaration that the war was finally over would have enormous symbolic importance for both Koreas.",

        "content": "To create the year\u2019s first must-see documentary, director Todd Douglas Miller worked with Nasa to restore fascinating unseen footage from 1969\nA man sips a beer, eyeing the horizon from a Florida parking lot. Nasa techs sit in a lobby as headlines blare of Ted Kennedy\u2019s car crash in Chappaquiddick. They\u2019re two of the many striking details \u2013 ordinary, recognizable moments amid one of humankind\u2019s most extraordinary achievements \u2013 restored to full vitality in Apollo 11, an all-primary source documentary, meticulously restored. The 93-minute documentary, released for a limited time in the US on Imax before a wider release, and to be shown in museums later this year, captures the first moon mission and its spectators in the visceral, wide-lens color of cinema epics \u2013 an achievement in historical preservation that hinged on the discovery of long-unopened boxes idling in archives.\nLast month, the film premiered to enthused acclaim at Sundance, following on from a banner year for documentaries from the recently Oscar-anointed Free Solo to fellow box office hits RBG, Three Identical Strangers and Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor. Apollo 11 is set to continue the trend but it is distinguished by its stark commitment to the historical record: the film is made up entirely of restored footage and audio from the historic Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.\nIt\u2019s a far cry from three years ago, when much of the record from Apollo 11 remained analog or boxed away. At the time, director Todd Douglas Miller, fresh off The Last Steps, a short about Apollo 17, wasn\u2019t looking to dive back into the heavily mythologized missions to the moon. When Stephen Slater, a Britain-based independent archivist who has peerlessly synced existing 16mm Mission Control footage with separate audio recordings, approached Miller about creating a project to honor Apollo 11\u2019s 50th anniversary this year, Miller balked. \u201cI was like, \u2018No. Not happening. I\u2019m all spaced out right now,\u2019\u201d he said to the Guardian. \u201cBut it became addictive.\u201d\nMiller and his team, including producing partner Tom Petersen, began with Apollo 11 footage they and Slater had already gathered for other projects. Between other work, the team and post-production office Final Frame tinkered with it, \u201cjust kind of constructing it with nothing more than, \u2018Could we do this?\u2019 We knew it was basically going to be an art film, but could we make it something that would be compelling?\u201d Miller said of this period in late 2016.\nThe answer, with significant help from Nasa and the National Archives, was a resounding yes, especially once Miller\u2019s request for all Apollo 11 archival material unearthed long-forgotten, large format, 70mm footage that captured the launch day in Hollywood-level rich detail.\n\u201cThe reels had been sitting there untouched, labeled \u2018Apollo 11\u2019 with some dates but nobody even knew what was on them,\u201d said Miller of the discovery. Dan Rooney, the supervisory archivist for the National Archives\u2019 Motion Picture, Sound, and Video branch knew of the existence of 65mm and 70mm Apollo-related footage \u2013 leftovers from Nasa promotional videos and a 1972 movie called Moonwalk One, shot in the same level of wide detail as 60s epics like Cleopatra \u2013 but didn\u2019t know what they held.\nSome of the treasures, beautifully caught: backroom footage of Nasa staff preparing a nervous yet genial Neil Armstrong in his space suit; a drowsy woman atop an old car, parked early to watch lift-off; the fiery trail of Apollo 11 reflected in a woman\u2019s oversize, mod shades.\nMiller said the process quickly snowballed into a historical preservation project to transfer all the large format, 16mm and 35mm film into digital. \u201cThe way to do it is to do it all. If you\u2019re going to do one, you might as well do it all,\u201d he said. In order to work around the clock, the team set up shop at a post-production studio, Final Frame, in New York City, and enlisted climate-control vans to safely transport the archival film back and forth from DC. \u201cWe just felt an immense responsibility to curate all the materials and make sure that they of course got back to their homes in a timely fashion,\u201d Miller said.\nMiller worked with Nasa\u2019s chief historian, Bill Barry, as well as Rooney and volunteers who contributed their own archival efforts as word of the ambitious project spread through the space enthusiast community.\n\u201cIt felt like kind of a passing of a baton,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIt was a real group effort to preserve materials that they had worked on decades ago.\u201d\nUltimately, Miller and his team sifted through material spanning nine days, including over 11,000 hours of previously uncatalogued audio provided from Nasa\u2019s troves. Paring down that real-time journey \u2013 every audio and video snippet, often overlapping, from the Apollo 11 mission \u2013 into a coherent, well-paced feature feels intimidating in retrospect, Miller said. At the time, it was immersive work. \u201cWe all felt just a huge responsibility to get it right,\u201d he said, recognizing that \u201cour work was informing the historical record itself\u201d.\nFor example, as a federal agency, Nasa has long relied on volunteers in its preservation efforts; most of the existing transcriptions were old volunteer copies. Miller\u2019s cataloguing helped correct discrepancies. \u201cReally the proudest moment for me in working on the film was being able to just contribute in a very scientific way \u2014 \u2018this guy didn\u2019t say that, it was this guy\u2019, or, \u2018that didn\u2019t take 12 seconds, it took 13 seconds\u2019.\u201d\nThe cooperative effort \u2013 archivists, drivers, production and post-production \u2013 is a small reflection of the massive coordination behind the real Apollo 11. \u201cClose to 400,000 people worked on [Apollo 11], spread across over 20,000 companies; it was just an immense operation,\u201d said Miller. And in the context of the late 60s \u2013 as the Vietnam war expanded into a tragic morass, fresh off the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F. Kennedy \u2013 \u201ccertainly there are parallels to [today]\u201d.\nMiller said he\u2019s watched the film at every screening. \u201c[Each time] I see things that I\u2019ve never seen before, and I\u2019ve been looking at it for years,\u201d he said. Ultimately, the historical record testifies to Apollo 11 as \u201cone of most, if not the greatest, example of when a government could actually come together and do something that inspires the world\u201d.\nLooking back on the preservation process, Miller sees a smaller-scale marvel of teamwork. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly proud of everybody who worked on it, from the audio guys to the people who transported [the material], the drivers \u2026 Hopefully this film proves that when a great many people come together, they can do something good.\u201d\nApollo 11 is released in the US on Imax on 1 March with a wider release on 8 March and a UK date yet to be announced",

As justice secretary, I would not be able to look myself in the mirror, bereaved families in the eye or our justice system with pride if we do not provide proper legal support to those who have been the victims of deaths in custody with legal aid representation.\u201d\n There are about 500 inquests a year into deaths in custody, prisons and mental health institutions. Labour estimates that the annual bill for legal aid to families involved in inquests involving the right to life would cost around \u00a34m a year. The government has claimed the cost would run into tens of millions.\n Burgon said: \u201cMany families of those who died as a result of state or corporate failures have called for a lasting legacy to prevent others going through what they have suffered.\u201d\n Last month, the government rejected calls to provide automatic legal aid funding at inquests where deaths involved state agencies.\n The justice minister, Lucy Frazer, told the Inquest meeting she would talk to other departments to see if she could provide extra funding. She faced angry calls for immediate action from those who have been denied legal representation in the past.\n Inquest has launched a campaign with a public petition in the wake of the Hillsborough inquest and disputes over the funding of representation for victims of the Birmingham pub bombings inquest.\n Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said the government\u2019s decision to deny legal aid was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of those who had invested so much time in the review. \u201cBereaved families need to be granted automatic legal aid for state-related deaths,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe felt that the government\u2019s response was patronising and dishonest.\u201d",

It is that inaccessibility and the risk of further erosion that has prompted the collaboration between Historic England and archaeologists from Newcastle University.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been recorded to modern standards, no one has really looked at them for 30-plus years,\u201d said Mike Collins, the inspector of ancient monuments for Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\nThe inscriptions are mostly of the \u2018\u2018this is the part I\u2019ve done\u201d type, and include the names of men and in some instances rank and military units. One of the inscriptions, EPPIVSM, is thought to be the individual who made it, M Eppius.\nAnother inscription reads VEX LI EG II AVG OF APR SVB AGRICOLA OPTIONE, which translates as \u201ca detachment of the Second Legion Augusta, the working face of Apr... under Agricola\u201d, the word OPTIONE indicating the rank of Agricola.\nThat is the bureaucratic side to the inscriptions. The human side is two eyes and a mouth which archaeologists believe is a humorous cartoon of the commanding officer. \u201cIt is very rough. Classical sculpture it is definitely not,\u201d said Collins, adding that after a hard day in the quarry with a demanding boss it is easy to imagine the circumstances in which it was done.\nOther graffiti only discovered on Tuesday during day one of the project includes a phallus. \u201cPhallus carvings are very common in the Roman period and are more a general symbol of good luck.\u201d A representation of a torso was also found for the first time and the letters MV.\nThe writings can be precisely dated because one of them reads APRO ET MAXIMO CONSVLIBVS OFICINA MERCATI, which translates as \u201cIn the consulship of Aper and Maximus\u201d. Aper and Maximus were consuls of the Roman Empire in AD207.\nThat was a year when the emperor himself was in Britain leading Roman military campaigns against troublesome tribes. He ordered major improvements to the wall, which had been built a century earlier. Such were the changes that it was not until the 19th century that it was conclusively established that the wall was started by Hadrian and not Severus.\nRoman Britain at the time was a turbulent place with frequent attacks on the wall. After a generation of frontier conflict Severus attempted and failed to subdue Caledonian tribes in the far north. He was planning a new push when he died in York in the winter of 211/212.\nThe Roman graffiti is seen as important because of its rarity. The site, in Gelt Woods near Brampton in Cumbria, is one of only a handful of Roman quarries in England which still feature inscriptions.\nArchaeologists are working with climbing specialists, and the operation involves them being winched 30ft down to the graffiti using ropes and pulleys. They are carrying out light cleaning before using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to produce a 3D record.\nThe results will be made public later in the year on the 3D content sharing platform Sketchfab. The project, funded by Historic England, has a degree of urgency because the rock is soft Cumbrian sandstone and has suffered natural erosion which will only continue.\nCollins hoped the graffiti records would be enjoyed by anyone interested in Roman history as well as being useful for the next generation of archaeologists. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what questions future archaeologists will have, so if we can record these now to the very best of our abilities then the information will be available even if there is a gradual, natural process of erosion.\u201d\nIan Haynes, a professor of archaeology at Newcastle University, said: \u201cThese inscriptions are very vulnerable to further gradual decay. This is a great opportunity to record them as they are in 2019, using the best modern technology to safeguard the ability to study them into the future.\u201d",

        "content": "As Brexit looms, leaders of key organisations warn of its potentially disastrous impact\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very worrying. Brexit is already impacting Northern Ireland: at the moment, if someone goes south and needs medical treatment, they are covered. But we don\u2019t know if that will remain [when the UK leaves the EU],\u201d says Marie Brown, director of Foyle Women\u2019s Aid in Derry, which supports women and children dealing with domestic violence. \u201cNorthern Ireland voted for remain. We didn\u2019t want this.\u201d\nLike many others working in public services on the island of Ireland, Brown is angry that in all the debate around the Irish backstop, politicians in Westminster are paying too little attention to the fact that a no-deal Brexit would mean the return of a hard borderthat could put lives as well as livelihoods in danger, for residents on both sides of the border.\nFor years now, women\u2019s organisations in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have worked together to support those affected by abusive relationships, wherever they live. \u201cIt can be as simple as crossing a bridge to get help,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIf a woman needs to come in [to our services], we can let her in.\u201d Brexit could change all this. In places like Clady, West Tyrone, which is divided from the Irish Republic only by the River Finn, Brown says a hard border could be disastrous. \u201cWomen could be stuck, when they could walk over a bridge and get to safety,\u201d says Brown. She worries, too, that a hard border might harm cross-border cooperation between police. \u201cIn the days when we had less cooperation, perpetrators used to use the border to avoid being arrested in domestic violence situations. That\u2019s a concern.\u201d\nWith just over a month until Britain is due to leave the EU, there\u2019s a desperate scramble to tackle the pile of problems that could be caused by a no-deal Brexit. In 2017, a study by the UK government and the European Commission listed 142 cross-border activities on the island that could be negatively impacted by a hard Brexit. It\u2019s not just in domestic violence situations that it could endanger lives. Although police chiefs on both sides have already pledged to continue arrangements that enable them to arrest and extradite criminals, they have warned that it could become harder to share information.\nThe status of looked-after children from the north could also be a problem. More childen have been placed in foster care in the Irish Republic in recent years, but there are no figures on how many may be affected, says Paddy Kelly, director of the Belfast-based Children\u2019s Law Centre, because the citizenship and immigration status of looked-after children has not been routinely or rigorously recorded. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to raise these issues ever since 2016,\u201d she says.\nHealthcare is a particular concern. In the past few years, all-island agreements have transformed services, with staff, patients, clinicians, medicines and ambulances all free to move between the two countries.\nSome health services have been consolidated, including cross-border cancer and cardiology services at Altnagelvin hospital, in Northern Ireland, and the centralisation of children\u2019s heart surgery in Dublin for the 400 children in the Irish Republic and the 140 in Northern Ireland every year who need heart operations.\nAmbulances and fire services attend emergency situations on both sides of the border. Between 2015 and 2018, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service attended 221 emergency calls in the Irish Republic, while their counterparts responded to 132 incidents in Northern Ireland.\nCross-border arrangements are vital, says Phil Alexander, chief executive of Belfast-based charity Cancer Fund for Children, which supports children and parents across the island of Ireland. He says it\u2019s hard to overstate the importance for families in Northern Ireland of having high-quality medical facilities available in Dublin, less than two hours\u2019 drive away from Belfast \u2013 otherwise, people would have to travel to mainland UK for specialist treatment. It makes visiting and supporting ill children far more accessible and less expensive than entire families having to fly over to Bristol, Birmingham or London.\nWhen Janet O\u2019Neill\u2019s son Robbie was just eight months old, he was diagnosed with cancer. A few months later, he was also diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder than can affect mulitple systems in the body. All-Ireland healthcare means Robbie\u2019s been able to travel wherever he needs for the best-possible care, including brachytherapy (internal) radiation treatment in France and regular checkups at Guy\u2019s hospital in London, as well as visits with his family to the Cancer Fund for Children\u2019s Daisy Lodge facility in Northern Ireland. \u201cThere\u2019s so much involved when a child is sick: just getting them the treatment and getting them to the hospital and getting the other child to school,\u201d says O\u2019Neill, who lives in Kilkenny, in the Irish Republic. \u201cGoing to Daisy Lodge brought us happiness in all of that. We can just drive up there and the way they looked after us all was indescribable. It was just beautiful.\u201d\nO\u2019Neill fears what\u2019s going to happen post-Brexit. While last week\u2019s announcement that the Irish government will continue funding health treatments in Northern Ireland for its citizens after Brexit is welcome, O\u2019Neill, who lives in the Republic, is still concerned. \u201cTo have the worry of having a hard border \u2013 it takes all the good out of it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there was a hard border, there could be safety issues., \u201cIt would put us and other families off going.\u201d\nBrexit also risks heightening staffing problems in public services. Every day, almost 15,000 people travel between the two jurisdictions for work or study, according to the risk register compiled by the 10 border councils on the island \u2013 five in the north, five in the south \u2013 to map out the issues likely to impact their residents, businesses and staff after Brexit. More than a quarter of jobs in Northern Ireland and just under one-fifth in the Irish Republic are in the public sector, and there are a number of practical concerns around how these employees could live and work on both sides of the border.\nNorthern Ireland already has a shortage of 2,000 nurses in the NHS and community care sector, and a recent report by the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA), which represents 6,000 organisations employing 44,000 people, warns of the dangers of public services becoming a casualty of Brexit. \u201cFreedom of movement and the provision of care and protection on an all-island basis is vital,\u201d it says. And free movement of staffing, medicines and cross-border security, post Brexit is not just for Irish and UK citizens, but for workers from the other 26 EU countries. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a deal, the situation is hardly likely to encourage people to move from the EU26 to Northern Ireland or to encourage Irish citizens to take jobs in Northern Ireland, so that in itself is a factor, when there are already big problems in staffing in health and social care,\u201d says Gordon Marnoch, reader in public policy at Ulster University.\nUltimately, some fear that Brexit could undermine the Good Friday agreement and jeopardise peace, with serious ramifications for public services. In October, the Belfast city region gained \u00a3350m from Westminster to develop tourism, infrastructure and digital services. This progress is based on peace and security, says Liam Hannaway, chief executive of Newry, Mourne and Down district council. \u201cI\u2019m not a doomsday person but there is potential for civil unrest,\u201d he says.\nBrown says: \u201cWhen we had violence here, women and children suffered terribly. Are we going to end up going back to those times?\u201d",

        "content": "Figures last year were the lowest for 11 years, with an overcrowded market and focus on \u2018worthy\u2019 books among the factors blamed\nA major slump in sales of young adult (YA) fiction in the UK has been greeted with alarm by authors, who are leaving the category in droves because of poor returns, and by experts who have warned that failing to make books easily available to young people could severely affect literacy levels.\nFigures from the Bookseller magazine show YA sales fell by \u00a36.2m to \u00a322.5m last year, the lowest point in 11 years, with volume down by 26.1% to 3.3m books sold. The decline follows a series of boom years earlier this decade, fuelled by film adaptations of bestsellers including Suzanne Collins\u2019s dystopian Hunger Games trilogy, John Green\u2019s love story The Fault in Our Stars and Veronica Roth\u2019s Divergent series.\nAt Waterstones, YA buyer Kate McHale admitted sales were \u201ca little bit down\u201d in 2018 compared with 2017, when books including Philip Pullman\u2019s The Book of Dust, Green\u2019s Turtles All the Way Down and Angie Thomas\u2019s The Hate U Give drove an \u201cincredible\u201d year. \u201cThere were some really brilliant titles, but even disregarding the big names, maybe not the breakout hits there were the year before. We don\u2019t necessarily expect every year to be quite the golden year that was,\u201d said McHale.\nExperts interviewed in the Bookseller blamed the drop on issues including an overcrowded market and a focus on \u201cworthy\u201d books. The novelist Sally Nicholls also told the magazine that \u201cmost of the UK YA authors I know are leaving YA and going to [write] children\u2019s or adults\u2019\u201d, because of low advances, with some writers offered just \u00a31,000 to write a full-length novel. \u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable. It\u2019s insulting,\u201d said Nicholls.\nKeren David, author of eight YA books, told the Guardian: \u201cI think there\u2019s a widespread feeling of disappointment with the general state of the market for UK YA at the moment. Many people are getting very low offers, and next to no promotion. Most people can\u2019t afford to carry on writing YA if advances drop to \u00a31,000.\u201d\nThe charts show that UK YA readers are currently flocking to American writers, with last year\u2019s top seller being US author Karen McManus\u2019s thriller One of Us Is Lying. Following her in the Top Five were American Angie Thomas\u2019s hit debut The Hate U Give, Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s Children of Blood and Bone, American Becky Albertalli\u2019s Love Simon, and Jamaican-American Nicola Yoon\u2019s Everything, Everything. Just one UK author made the 2018 Top 10: Michelle Magorian, for the classic title Goodnight Mister Tom.\n\u201cThere is still widespread ignorance about what YA is (\u2018It\u2019s all vampires!\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all worthy sicklit!\u2019) It occupies an uneasy place between children\u2019s and adults, and in the main, the only books that get a lot of promotion are the American ones,\u201d David said. \u201cWhether the British market can ever be big enough to sustain YA writers is doubtful. I think it\u2019s sad if all youth culture is filtered through an American viewpoint. It means British kids are less engaged with their own country and experiences.\u201d\nAuthor Sheena Wilkinson agreed. \u201cI think YA has become a slightly pejorative term \u2013 and when you aren\u2019t having a great range of books published it\u2019s possible to see why. When I go into bookshops I see a lot of YA, but not a lot of diversity. I see a lot of imported YA, mostly from the US,\u201d said Wilkinson, author of seven YA novels. \u201cTeens have always embraced US culture, that\u2019s nothing new. But it seems a shame that this is promoted at the expense of homegrown writers. Not out of any wish to be parochial, but because it\u2019s hard enough for writers to make a living in what is essentially a small market.\u201d\nMcHale added: \u201cIt is quite easy for the big US names to dominate in a way that doesn\u2019t happen in other genres, and that can pose a few problems for getting UK authors to that same level of noise.\u201d\nBut despite the dominance of Americans, the Waterstones bookseller said that YA fiction had \u201cmoved quite firmly away\u201d from the dystopian fantasy that began to dominate the charts a decade ago. The Hunger Games, published in 2008, led the charge, telling of a 16-year-old heroine in a post-apocalyptic future. It was followed by huge series including James Dashner\u2019s Maze Runner titles, first published in 2009, and Roth\u2019s Divergent books, launched in 2011. But as readers began to experience a surfeit of such fiction, McHale pointed to a number of genres selling well in YA today; Waterstones\u2019 \u201colder fiction\u201d shortlist for its children\u2019s book prize ranges from Children of Blood and Bone, which draws on African mythology, to Malcolm Duffy\u2019s Me Mam. Me Dad. Me, which follows the life of a 14-year-old Geordie boy. \u201cWhat is brilliant is the range of genres; YA is an age category not a genre,\u201d said McHale.\nWhat is not so brilliant, said children\u2019s books consultant Jake Hope is the decision by publishers to price YA titles the same as adult mainstream fiction. He pointed to the \u00a37.99 price point for both The Hate U Give and Children of Blood and Bone \u2013 the same amount charged for paperbacks of David Baldacci\u2019s The Fallen and Anthony Horowitz\u2019s The Word Is Murder.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there an inherent imbalance in the fact that young adults, often in full-time education or, if employed, in entry positions \u2013 are expected to have the same disposable income as adults? That might not be such an issue were it not for the fact that education spend is down,\u201d he said.\nAnd the decline in YA sales comes alongside a drop in lending of children\u2019s books at public libraries. School libraries are also in dire straits: the School Library Association estimates its numbers have declined by at least 1,000 members since 2006, with schools trying to save money by cutting their librarians. Library spend on books decreased last year to \u00a329.1m. Experts fear these factors will have a long-term impact on reading habits.\n\u201cFormerly, a lot of YA was bought by school libraries and public libraries. They have had budgets slashed and are increasingly getting rid of the professional librarians who know about what young people read,\u201d said Wilkinson.\n\u201cRealistically, \u00a329.1m is a tiny amount for something that holds the potential to benefit so many,\u201d said Hope. \u201cReading is a great equaliser and is the biggest lever of social change. But to achieve that, there has to be access to books.\u201d",

You were turned down by the latter because easyJet blamed crew issues which were excluded from payouts in the insurer\u2019s terms and conditions, whereas technical faults, the reason given to your friend, were covered.\nEasyJet told me this reason was, in fact, given in error and that the delay was due to an absent crew member. \u201cWe have apologised for the confusion and for the delay in payment of her compensation and expenses,\u201d it says. \u201cThese have been processed, along with a gesture of goodwill.\u201d\nTwo weeks later you\u2019d still received nothing and easyJet blamed another error.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAfter several years of threatening Xiaomi has finally entered the UK with a series of good-value smartphones starting from \u00a399 including the range-topping Mi Mix 3. But has \u201cChina\u2019s Apple\u201d delivered something new, or just another forgettable Chinese smartphone?\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAt first glance the \u00a3499 Mi Mix 3 looks fairly boring. The front has a giant display, just like the rest. The back appears shiny glass, just like the rest. It\u2019s got polished metal sides, just like most. But pick up the phone and you realise it\u2019s hiding more than one secret.\nCloser inspection of the good-looking 6.39in full HD+ AMOLED screen shows there\u2019s no notch or camera hole anywhere, and it only has a very slim bezel all round. Instead the screen slides down like something from yesteryear revealing a dual-camera ready to capture your selfies.\nThe screen slides with a solid and reassuring clunk, and can be accompanied by your choice of tone. By default the slider launches the selfie camera, but it can be configured to launch other apps.\nAlso, the back is not glass, but ceramic. Highly polished and a fingerprint magnet, but surprisingly grippy in the hand, which combined with the curved sides makes holding on to the Mi Mix 3 relatively easy considering its size.\nAt 74.7mm wide and 157.9mm tall the Mi Mix 3 is more or less the same as its direct competition: the Honor View20 and OnePlus 6T.\nBut the Mi Mix 3 weighs 218g, which is a full 38g heavier than the Honor and heavier still than Apple\u2019s 208g iPhone XS Max, which makes it more difficult to handle.\nA dual rear camera pops out at the top left of the back, while a good and fast fingerprint scanner is located within easy reach of your index finger in the middle.\nScreen: 6.39in FHD+ AMOLED (403ppi)\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 845\nRAM: 6GB of RAM\nStorage: 128GB\nOperating system: MIUI 10.2 based on Android 9 Pie\nCamera: rear dual 12MP camera, front dual 24MP selfie-camera\nConnectivity: dual sim, LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging and GPS\nDimensions: 157.9 x 74.7 x 8.5mm\nWeight: 218g\nThe Mi Mix 3 packs the same top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and 6GB of RAM as most of the competition from 2018 and so is just as capable. Despite the cheaper price you are buying a flagship phone.\nThat means the Mi Mix 3 will handle pretty much anything you want to do, be it graphically intensive gaming, photo or video processing. Nothing about it feels sluggish with apps loading promptly all round.\nBattery life is also solid but not exceptional, lasting around 25 hours between charges with fairly heavy usage, which places it around five hours behind its direct competition. If you forget to charge it overnight, it\u2019ll at least survive till your wake up alarm the next morning.\nCharging via included cable charger hit 50% in just under 30 minutes and reached full in 90 minutes. A small circular wireless charging pad, into which the cabled charger plugs via USB-C, is included in the box, which is pretty rare for any phone, let alone a cut-price one.\nLike many of the Chinese smartphone brands, Xiaomi customises Android for its phones with software called MIUI (Mi user interface).\nThe Mi Mix 3 runs the latest version, MIUI 10.2, which is based on Android 9 Pie, but looks like a cross between Android and iOS. There\u2019s no app drawer, for instance, with all apps having to be placed on the homescreen like iOS, which inevitably leads to folders full of app icons you wish you could hide.\nIt also comes with a variety of apps pre-installed, such as AliExpress, Twitter, Facebook, Opera and the MIUI forum, but you can delete them.\nGenerally MIUI works fine, but there are some odd choices. For instance, you can\u2019t swipe notifications away to the left, only to the right. The leftmost homescreen panel is the company\u2019s own screen with shortcuts, your calendar, a \u201csecurity\u201d widget and a notepad, which I\u2019d trade for Google\u2019s discover feed any day of the week. There\u2019s also a confusing mix of do not disturb (DND) and mute buttons, which can conflict. Turn off DND and it switches on the ringtones and sounds, even if you have the phone set to only vibrate, which means hitting the mute button again.\nOne good part of MIUI is its navigation gestures, which come a close second to Apple\u2019s best-in-class system for iOS. Swipe up from the bottom to go home, up and hold for the recently used apps. Swipe in from either edge of the screen for back or swipe and hold to go immediately to the last used app.\nThe rear dual 12-megapixel camera has a similar set up to most with one acting as a regular wide-angle camera and the other a 2x telephoto camera.\nImages shot in good light are great, with a good amount of detail and texture, relatively balanced colours and accurate focus, when you get a lock. I found it struggled to get a solid focus occasionally when using the 2x zoom, forcing me to repeatedly tap the screen and slowing down the shot as a result.\nZoom all the way up to 8x matches some of the best too, preserving a good amount of detail at maximum zoom.\nThe AI system identifies scenes and tweaks colours accordingly, which worked fairly well and wasn\u2019t too aggressive with Instagram-like colour blowout that some similar systems create. Low-light performance was OK, but not up there with the best. Portrait mode was equally good, but not great.\nThe slider selfie camera is a bit of a mixed bag. It is capable of capturing a good amount of detail, but struggled to focus properly more than once. Beauty mode is there to smooth out skin imperfections if too much detail is a little unflattering. Low light performance was middling, introducing a lot of noise.\nOverall, the Mi Mix 3 has a highly capable camera system that keeps up with most of last year\u2019s top phones, but falls short of being the absolute best in a few areas.\nYou get a 10W wireless charging pad in the box which takes the phone\u2019s cabled charger\nThere\u2019s an AI button you can configure to launch Google Assistant, or a variety of other apps or functions\nThe Mi Mix 3 vibrates every time anything turns up in the notification shade, including the download manager for app updates and other bits, which can get annoying\nA 5G version of the Mi Mix 3 is due to go on sale later this year\nThe Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 costs \u00a3499 in either blue or black.\nFor comparison, the 128GB Honor View20 costs \u00a3500, the OnePlus 6T costs \u00a3499, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs \u00a3900, the Google Pixel 3 XL costs \u00a3869 with 64GB, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs \u00a3899 with 128GB and the 64GB iPhone XR costs \u00a3749.\nXiaomi\u2019s entry into the UK is a very welcome one. It is capable of producing some really good smartphones at very competitive prices and the Mi Mix 3 is no exception.\nAt \u00a3499 the Mi Mix 3 isn\u2019t just another boring Chinese smartphone. Instead you get something unique with the sliding mechanism solving the problem of where do you put the selfie camera. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t take many selfies, then this is the ideal solution.\nThe screen is good, performance is excellent, battery life is solid and camera performance is good too. Plus you get a wireless charger in the box. However, Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI software isn\u2019t up to the competition from Google, OnePlus or Samsung, even if it does have very good gesture navigation.\nThe Mi Mix 3 is also pretty heavy, even for its size, which makes handling it more difficult compared to lighter devices such as Honor\u2019s View20.\nIf you want something a bit different the Mi Mix 3 is a great option, and an excellent opening gambit in the UK from Xiaomi.\nPros: notchless all-screen design, good screen, slide-out camera, wireless charging and pad in the box, top performance, solid battery life, good camera, excellent value, great gesture navigation\nCons: MIUI software isn\u2019t as good as the competition, heavy, no water resistance, no headphone socket\nHonor View20 review: top phone at half the cost of an iPhone XS\nOnePlus 6T review: you\u2019d have to spend double to get better than this\niPhone XR review: Apple\u2019s cheaper battery king\nHuawei Mate 20 Pro review: cutting-edge brilliance\niPhone XS Max review: Apple\u2019s supersized smartphone\nGoogle Pixel 3 XL review: big is still beautiful",

        "content": "Indian confirms one pilot missing and claims it shot down one Pakistani jet on day of skirmishes\nPakistan has conducted airstrikes over the ceasefire line in disputed Kashmir and claims to have shot down two Indian jets that responded by entering Pakistani airspace, capturing both of the pilots.\nIndia confirmed that one of its pilots is missing in action and said it shot down one of the Pakistani jets as it escaped over the heavily militarised border separating the two.\nThe skirmishes, a day after India flew sorties into Pakistan for the first time in nearly 50 years, are steep escalations in the most serious military crisis in south Asia since the pair fought a brief war in the Himalayas in 1999.\nWho controls Kashmir?\nThe region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since\u00a0India\u00a0and Pakistan came into being in 1947.\nBoth claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.\nIndia and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.\nHow did the dispute start?\nAfter the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.\nKashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.\nIn 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.\nIn its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.\nWhat was Kashmir\u2019s special status?\nKashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u00a0\nAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.\nOn Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had\u00a0 only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.\nWhat do the militants want?\nThere has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.\nUntil 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u00a0extreme force\u00a0in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.\nFor Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe\nImran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, used a televised address to call for dialogue to prevent more reprisals, making reference to both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals.\n\u201cWith the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?\u201d Khan said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we think that, if this escalates, what will it lead to?\u201d\nPakistan has released footage purportedly showing one of the captured Indian pilots, a wing commander who gave his name as Abhinandan. His uniform was bloody and a rag was tied around his head. He gave his name, service number, rank and religion, but when asked for more, replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, that\u2019s all I\u2019m supposed to tell you.\u201d\nThe country\u2019s armed forces spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor said one pilot was being interrogated and the second was injured and being treated in hospital.\nIndia said it was aware that Pakistan had claimed to have one pilot in its custody. \u201cWe are ascertaining the facts,\u201d the spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry, Raveesh Kumar, told journalists in Delhi.\nThe dogfights on Wednesday morning \u2013 the first publicly acknowledged between the two countries since 1971 \u2013 have shut down commercial flights across Pakistan and north India. Flight radar images showed deserted airspace over both countries. All commercial airports in Pakistan have been shut along with eight major Indian airports including those in Jammu city, Srinagar and Amritsar.\nIn Srinagar, the capital of disputed Kashmir, a work crew could be seen painting a large red cross on the top of Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital, marking it out as a medical facility from above.\nPakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday morning that it had struck \u201cnon-military target[s]\u201d across the ceasefire line in Kashmir without entering Indian airspace to demonstrate its \u201cright, will and capability for self defence\u201d.\n\u201cWe have no intention of escalation, but are fully prepared to do so if forced into that paradigm,\u201d said Mohammad Faisal, the foreign affairs ministry\u2019s spokesman.\nGhafoor told a media briefing on Wednesday afternoon Pakistan struck six targets on the Indian side of the ceasefire line, ensuring they kept a safe distance away from civilian, administrative or military sites.\n\u201cWhen PAF [Pakistan Air Force] took targets, IAF\u2019s [Indian Air Force] two planes violated the line of control and entered Pakistan,\u201d he said. \u201cPAF was ready, there was an engagement and as a result both Indian planes were shot down. One wreckage fell on our side and another wreckage fell on their side.\u201d\nHe told the Guardian after the briefing that Pakistan had not entered Indian airspace. \u201cWe want to send the message that we have the ability to strike, the capability for self defence, but in the way of a responsible nation,\u201d he said.\nBut India rejected his account. \u201c[Pakistan] used its air force to target military installation on the Indian side,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cDue to a high state of readiness and alertness Pakistan\u2019s attempt were foiled successfully. The Pakistan air force was a detected and the Indian air force responded instantly.\n\u201cIn that aerial engagement one Pakistan fighter airplane was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian air force. The Pakistan airplane was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side.\u201d\nPakistan has denied losing an aircraft in the morning\u2019s engagements.\nIn a national address on Wednesday afternoon, Khan called for talks between Delhi and Islamabad. \u201cI will tell you again that better sense should prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should sit down and resolve our problems through dialogue.\u201d\nAnother Indian aircraft crashed about 150km away in Budgam district on Wednesday, killing at least one person aboard, but it was unrelated to the fighting.\nIndia has been on high alert since Tuesday\u2019s strikes, an operation Islamabad had promised to repay with its own \u201csurprise\u201d attack.\nFighter jets patrolled the skies above Srinagar, the capital of disputed Kashmir, throughout Tuesday night as India and Pakistan traded mortar fire a few hundred miles away at the ceasefire border.\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, issued a statement largely supportive of India, characterising its incursion five miles into neighbouring territory a \u201ccounter terrorism action\u201d and calling on Pakistan to take \u201cmeaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil\u201d.\nThere are still significant questions over what, if anything, was struck by India\u2019s fighter jets in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Both countries agree that Indian jets made it to within at least a few miles of Balakot, a small city about five miles inside Pakistani territory. But accounts diverge from there.\nIndia claims it hit a militant training camp and killed \u201ca very large number\u201d of fighters from the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group, which took responsibility for a 14 February suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitaries.\nPakistan says the Indian fighters were confronted before they could reach Balakot and dropped four to five bombs in an open field as they fled back across the border.\nBoth countries mounted media blitzes to push their particular narrative but had appeared to leave room to de-escalate the conflict.\nOn Wednesday morning, India\u2019s external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s military was not the target of the sorties.\n\u201cNo military installations were targeted,\u201d Swaraj said. \u201cThe limited objective of the pre-emptive strike was to act decisively against the terrorist infrastructure of the JeM in order to pre-empt another terrorist attack in India.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIndia does not wish see further escalation of the situation and India will continued to act with responsibility and restraint.\u201d\nPakistan is holding a joint session of parliament on Wednesday afternoon followed by a meeting of the National Command Authority, whose responsibilities include overseeing the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\u201cIt is your turn now to wait and get ready for our surprise,\u201d Ghafoor said on Tuesday night.\nBoth armies accused the other of shelling villages and opposition army posts across the line of control that separates Indian and Pakistani controlled Kashmir.\nA Pakistani police official told the Associated Press that six people were killed by Indian mortar attacks. Indian security officials did not report any casualties but said villages were hit including Kamalkote and Kalgo, both near the heavily guarded military border.\nTwo militants allegedly belonging to JeM were shot dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir Shopain district on Wednesday morning, in the fourth counter-insurgency operation since a car laden with explosives was detonated by an Indian paramilitary convoy, sparking the latest round of tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.\nMarkets and shops across Kashmir were shut on Wednesday in protest at the arrests of hundreds of separatist activists and leaders in the days before Tuesday\u2019s military operations.",

        "content": "Concrete is everywhere, but it\u2019s bad for the planet, generating large amounts of carbon dioxide. Creative alternatives are in the pipeline\nThey call them plyscrapers: the sudden emergence of tall buildings constructed almost entirely from timber. Vancouver, Vienna and Brumunddal in Norway have all claimed recently to have the tallest wooden building in the world, and now Tokyo has its own designs on the informal title.\nMaking buildings from wood may seem like a rather medieval idea. But there is a very modern issue that is driving cities and architects to turn to treated timber as a resource: climate change.\nConcrete is the second most used substance in the global economy, after water \u2013 and one of the world\u2019s biggest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The chemical process by which cement, the key ingredient of concrete, is created involves large quantities of carbon dioxide.\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nThe UN estimates that there will be 9.8 billion people living on the planet by mid-century. They will need somewhere to live. If concrete is the only answer to the construction of new cities, then carbon emissions will soar, aggravating global warming.\nAnd so scientists and builders have started innovating with other materials, in a scramble for alternatives to a universal commodity that has underpinned our modern life for centuries.\nThe problem with replacing concrete is that it is so very good at what it does. Chris Cheeseman, professor of materials resources engineering at Imperial College London, says the key thing to consider is the vast extent to which concrete is used around the world, and is likely to continue to be used. \u201cConcrete is not a high-carbon product. Cement is high-carbon, but concrete is not. But it is the scale on which it is used that makes it high carbon. The sheer scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the issue.\u201d\nNot only are the raw materials for concrete available cheaply and in abundance in most places around the globe, but the stuff itself has marvellous properties: Portland cement, the vital component of concrete, is mouldable and pourable, but quickly sets hard.\nCheeseman also notes another advantage: concrete and steel have similar thermal expansion properties, so steel can be used to reinforce concrete, making it far stronger and more flexible as a building material than it could be on its own. The steel used can be recycled, reducing its carbon impact, but Cheeseman says the combination of steel and concrete \u2013 giving enormous strength to buildings, while being mouldable and widely available \u2013 is hard to beat. \u201cIt is amazing stuff. Making anything with similar properties is going to be very difficult.\u201d\n \nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on \nconfrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis\n series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope,\n as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that \nmight and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we \nshould report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nUsing wood, for example, is not straightforward. Wood absorbs moisture from the air and is susceptible to rot and pests, not to mention fire.\nBut treating wood and combining it with other materials can improve its properties. Cross-laminated timber is engineered wood, made from gluing layers of solid-sawn timber together, crosswise, to form building blocks. This material is lightweight but as strong as concrete and steel, and construction experts say it can be more versatile and faster to work with than concrete and steel \u2013 and even, it seems, quieter.\nStora Enso is Europe\u2019s biggest supplier of cross-laminated timber, and Markus Mannstr\u00f6m, the executive vice-president for biomaterials, reports that the company is seeing increasing demand globally for building in wood, with climate change concerns the key driver. The Nordic countries, where Stora Enso is based, with their large forest resources, have been leading the way, but the company is seeing increasing demand across the world, including in Asia. It plants two or three trees for every tree used, which has contributed to Sweden doubling its rate of forest cover in the past century. Of course, using timber in a building also locks away the carbon that it has absorbed as it grew.\nEven treated wood, however, has limitations. In Norway, the Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet building is planned to be the tallest in the world with a wooden frame. It will rise 88 metres tall, with 18 storeys, and will be used for offices, hotel rooms and apartments. Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet may not hold its crown for long, if construction goes ahead on a project in Japan, the W350: that will reach 70 storeys, and be made of 90% wood. But it is still in the early stages of planning.\nOnly when these concepts have been proven in practice will it be possible to see wood as a widespread alternative to concrete in constructing tall buildings.\nFly ash is a possible alternative. It is a byproduct of coal-burning power plants \u2013 cinders, the unburnt parts of the coal that used to be allowed to disperse into the air, or fall to the bottom of power station chimneys, but in modern power plants are collected instead. It can be incorporated into concrete mixes to make up as much as 15% to 30% of the cement, without harming the strength or durability of the resulting mix.\nA byproduct of the iron-ore processing industry, ground granulated blast-furnace slag, can also be of use in a similar way. This is incorporated into concrete mixes, and has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut Anna Surgenor, senior sustainability adviser at the UK\u2019s Green Building Council, which is currently engaged in educating its construction industry members on the availability of cement replacements, notes that although these waste products can save carbon in the concrete mix, their use is not always straightforward.\n\u201cIt is possible to replace the cement content in concrete with waste products \u2013 a built asset could also use alternative materials [such as timber] in construction to lower the overall carbon impact. But there are several calculations that need to be considered across the entire life cycle of the building \u2013 these include factoring in where these materials are being shipped from. If they are transported over long distances, using fossil fuels, the use of alternative materials might not make sense from an overall carbon reduction perspective.\u201d\nFly ash from coal and slag from iron ore are abundant in some of the areas where concrete is most needed, including rapidly developing countries such as China and India. But they are heavy and that means it is not only carbon-intensive to transport over long distances, but also expensive.\nOther mooted materials have pros and cons. Magnesium silicates are not as widely available as the building blocks of concrete, for instance, limiting their appeal. Calcite clays show promise, according to Cheeseman, but will reduce concrete emissions only by about a third \u2013 worth doing, but not a comprehensive solution.\nResearch at Lancaster University has found that adding vegetable particles \u2013 yes, carrots or sugar beet \u2013 can strengthen concrete while reducing the volume of cement required. Similar work is being conducted with bamboo and other fibres.\nGraphene, a wonder material invented in the UK early this century, is also coming into play. Experts at the University of Exeter have used graphene in concrete construction to create a new composite material that is twice as strong as traditional concrete and four times more water-resistant. Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience in the university\u2019s engineering department, called the new material \u201can absolute game-changer\u201d, and work is continuing on how to develop it further. Commercial introduction is still some way off.\nWhile these technologies are all promising ideas, they are either expensive, unproven or based on materials that are not abundant. Thinktank the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House produced an overview last year of innovation in the industry, which reached the gloomy conclusion: \u201cSome novel cements have been discussed for more than a decade within the research community, without breaking through. At present, these alternatives are rarely as cost-effective as conventional cement, and they face raw-material shortages and resistance from customers.\u201d\nGiven the slow take-up of alternatives to concrete and their limitations, attention has turned to solutions such as capturing and storing, or even using, the carbon dioxide that results from its production.\nCarbonCure, a Canadian company, recycles carbon dioxide in its products. Liquefied carbon dioxide is captured from industrial processes and injected into concrete while it is being made, which helps with the process of cement incorporation. The company has so far reduced carbon emissions through its products roughly equivalent to taking about 5,000 cars off the road.\nBut carbon-capture technology remains very expensive and only a handful of projects have been trying to innovate in this way to reduce the emissions from cement.\n Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

        "content": "Enough to induce a panic attack ... a brutal portrait of climate change and our future lives on Earth. But we have the tools to avoid it\nYou already know it\u2019s bad. You already know the weather has gone weird, the ice caps are melting, the insects are disappearing from the Earth. You already know that your children, and your children\u2019s children, if they are reckless or brave enough to reproduce, face a vista of rising seas, vanishing coastal cities, storms, wildfires, biblical floods. As someone who reads the news and is sensitive to the general mood of the times, you have a general sense of what we\u2019re looking at. But do you truly understand the scale of the tribulations we face? David Wallace-Wells, author of the distressingly titled The Uninhabitable Earth, is here to tell you that you do not. \u201cIt is,\u201d as he puts it in the book\u2019s first line, \u201cworse, much worse, than you think.\u201d\nThe book expands on a viral article, also titled The Uninhabitable Earth, which Wallace-Wells published in New York in the summer of 2017, and which frightened the life out of everyone who read it. Writing at length, he is even more remorseless in his delineation of what the not nearly distant enough future probably holds for us. The book\u2019s longest section, entitled Elements of Chaos, is composed of 12 short and brutal chapters, each of which foretells a specific dimension of our forecast doom, and whose titles alone \u2013 Heat Death; Dying Oceans; Unbreathable Air; Plagues of Warming \u2013 are enough to induce an honest-to-God panic attack.\nWallace-Wells identifies a tendency, even among those of us who think we are already sufficiently terrified of the future, to be strangely complacent about the figures. Yes, we know that climate change will cause sea level rises of between four to eight feet before the end of this century, but then again what\u2019s a few feet if you happen to live a couple of miles inland? \u201cThat so many feel already acclimated to the prospect of a near-future world with dramatically higher oceans,\u201d he writes, \u201cshould be as dispiriting and disconcerting as if we\u2019d already come to accept the inevitability of extended nuclear war \u2013 because that is the scale of devastation the rising oceans will bring.\u201d\nThe book is extremely effective in shaking the reader out of that complacency. Some things I did not want to learn, but learned anyway: every return flight from London to New York costs the Arctic three square metres of ice; for every half degree of warming, societies see between a 10 and 20% increase in the likelihood of armed conflict; global plastic production is expected to triple by 2050, by which point there will be more plastic than fish in the planet\u2019s oceans. The margins of my review copy of the book are scrawled with expressions of terror and despair, declining in articulacy as the pages proceed, until it\u2019s all just cartoon sad faces and swear words.\nThere is a widespread inclination to think of climate change as a form of compound payback for two centuries of industrial capitalism. But among Wallace-Wells\u2019s most bracing revelations is how recent the bulk of the destruction has been, how sickeningly fast its results. Most of the real damage, in fact, has taken place in the time since the reality of climate change became known. And we are not slowing down. One of the sentences I found most upsetting in this book composed almost exclusively of upsetting sentences: \u201cWe are now burning 80% more coal than we were just in the year 2000.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also a temptation, when thinking about climate change, to focus on denialism as the villain of the piece. The bigger problem, Wallace-Wells points out, is the much vaster number of people (and governments) who acknowledge the true scale of the problem, and still act as if it\u2019s not happening. Outright climate denialism as a political force, he argues, is essentially a US phenomenon \u2013 which is to say, essentially, a phenomenon of the Republican party \u2013 and the US is responsible for only 15% of the world\u2019s emissions. \u201cTo believe the fault for global warming lies exclusively with the Republican party or its fossil-fuel backers is a form of American narcissism.\u201d (I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever heard anyone make quite so simplistic a case, but the point about denialism as largely a red herring is an important one.)\nThis all makes for relentlessly grim reading, particularly in that first section. As is generally the case in any sustained exposure to the subject of climate change \u2013 a subject that can seem increasingly like the only subject \u2013 a kind of apocalyptic glaze descends over even the most conscientious eyes, a peculiarly contemporary compound of boredom and horror. (\u201cHuman kind,\u201d as the bird in TS Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets sagely points out, \u201ccannot bear very much reality.\u201d) It\u2019s a problem of which Wallace-Wells is clearly aware. \u201cIf you have made it this far, you are a brave reader,\u201d as he puts it, somewhere past the halfway point, acknowledging the likelihood of the material he\u2019s sifting through causing despondency in anyone considering it. \u201cBut you are not merely considering it,\u201d he clarifies, \u201cyou are about to embark on living it. In many cases, in many places, we already are.\u201d\nThat last point turns out to be one of the most crucial of the book\u2019s warnings. Because as dire as the projections are, if you are surveying the topic from a privileged western vantage, it\u2019s easy to overlook how bad things have already got, to accept the hurricanes and the heatstroke deaths as simply the unfortunate nature of things. In this way, Wallace-Wells raises the disquieting spectre of future normalisation \u2013 the prospect that we might raise, incrementally but inexorably, our baseline of acceptable human suffering. (This phenomenon is not without precedent. See, for example, the whole of human history.)\nFor a relatively short book, The Uninhabitable Earth covers a great deal of cursed ground \u2013 drought, floods, wildfires, economic crises, political instability, the collapse of the myth of progress \u2013 and reading it can feel like taking a hop-on hop-off tour of the future\u2019s sprawling hellscape. It\u2019s not without its hopeful notes: in a sense, none of this would even be worth talking about if there were nothing we could do about it. As Wallace-Wells points out, we already have all the tools we need to avoid the worst of what is to come: \u201ca carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy; a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet; and public investment in green energy and carbon capture\u201d. The fact that the route out of this hell is straightforward does not mean, of course, that it won\u2019t be incredibly arduous, or that we should be confident of making it.\nThe book, however, is less focused on solutions than on clarifying the scale of the problem, the horror of its effects. You could call it alarmist, and you would not be wrong. (In the closing pages, Wallace-Wells himself accepts the charge as \u201cfair enough, because I am alarmed\u201d.) But to read The Uninhabitable Earth \u2013 or to consider in any serious way the scale of the crisis we face \u2013 is to understand the collapse of the distinction between alarmism and plain realism. To fail to be alarmed is to fail to think about the problem, and to fail to think about the problem is to relinquish all hope of its solution.\n Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s To Be a Machine is published by Granta.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAs Donald Trump surged towards a jaw-dropping election victory in late 2016, scholar Stephen Greenblatt wrote in the New York Times: \u201cIn the early 1590s, Shakespeare sat down to write a play that addressed a problem: How could a great country wind up being governed by a sociopath?\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe play was Richard III, currently being performed just a mile from the White House by the Shakespeare Theatre Company. Its resonances are hard to miss for audiences in Washington, a liberal bastion that some liken to a city under occupation during the Trump presidency.\nThe theatre company\u2019s own monarch is about to step down. Artistic director Michael Kahn retires at the end of the season after 33 years. His successor is Simon Godwin who, having earned plaudits at the UK\u2019s National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), now swaps Brexit Britain for Trump\u2019s Washington. Nowhere is the collision of politics and art more acute.\n\u201cTo think about putting on Shakespeare in the city of power is so exciting because so many of his plays are about rhetoric and the law and language and persuasion and high stakes,\u201d Godwin, 40, says in an interview with the Guardian at the company\u2019s Sidney Harman Hall.\n\u201cI\u2019m conscious that it\u2019s a very charged and very emotional time and it\u2019s a time that is volatile. I think that theatre can often either benefit or suffer from those moments, partly because you do become a barometer for certain energies and ideas and if you misstep those it\u2019s perilous but, if you exquisitely capture the moment, theatre becomes more charged than ever.\u201d\nGodwin, whose father David Godwin is a literary agent, grew up in St Albans, studied at Cambridge and exudes a quirky English self-confidence. His first season at the helm will be a suitably Anglo-American affair. There is Everybody (a retelling of the 15th-century morality play Everyman) by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, a new version of Peter Pan by Lauren Gunderson that puts Wendy centre stage as a proto-scientist, a reimagining of Godwin\u2019s acclaimed production of Timon of Athens starring Kathryn Hunter, The Amen Corner by James Baldwin (back in the spotlight after his novel, If Beale Street Could Talk, was adapted for the big screen), Emma Rice\u2019s play with music Romantics Anonymous and Shakespeare\u2019s Much Ado About Nothing.\n\u201cI think what people are hungry for here is generosity of spirit,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to go to the darkness so long as you also bring them into the light. But look, the comparison that I used when I was sharing the programme with people is that I am running a very successful restaurant in London, I\u2019m about to open a new restaurant in Washington, some of the dishes people will enjoy and some of them, I will discover, they don\u2019t like at all.\u201d\nBack in Britain, Shipwreck, a History Play About 2017 by Anne Washburn, brimming with debate about the meaning of Trump and Trumpism, has just opened at the Almeida Theatre in London, prompting theatre critic Ben Brantley to wonder \u201cwhy does this New Yorker have to cross an ocean to see what promises to be this season\u2019s most exciting American play?\u201d Despite his new company\u2019s close proximity to the White House, Godwin has no immediate plans to tackle the subject of this peculiar presidency head on.\n\u201cI think I need to understand a little bit about what Trump represents in people\u2019s imaginations so that I can be in dialogue with that rather than simply reproduce him. What forces does he represent, what forces is he the emblem of and how do people feel about that and how to put that in a debate? Because after all, what makes Shakespeare great is that the balance of argument in his plays is so finely matched. That\u2019s why they\u2019re an intellectual workout and I think that\u2019s why audiences in Washington have enjoyed them so much.\u201d\nDon\u2019t expect glib Trump-bashing screeds designed to preach to the Washington converted. \u201cThe great thing about Shakespeare is we didn\u2019t know what his politics were. You could find examples of him taking one view and then in another play really a very different one. So I feel that what we should be doing is doing shows that lots of different sides can feel heard within rather than being partisan or easily caught in one position or another. For me, the Shakespeare values that are there are things like empathy, generosity of spirit, attention to detail, the power of language, the ability of art to rekindle a love of life. And so he\u2019s political and yet he\u2019s beyond politics.\u201d\nShakespeare has a long and winding history in America. During the civil war, a production of Julius Caesar in New York starred John Wilkes Booth and his two brothers to raise funds for a Shakespeare statue in Central Park. The following year, at Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington, Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln. As the actor fled into hiding, he quoted from Macbeth in the last words of his diary: \u201c\u2018I must fight the course.\u2019 \u2019Tis all that\u2019s left in me.\u201d Washington is also home to the Folger Shakespeare Library, which contains the world\u2019s biggest Shakespeare collection.\nWhat is Godwin, who starts in September, expecting on this side of the Atlantic? \u201cProbably there\u2019s an approach that is fresher and that\u2019s freer from history and from any kind of habit. There\u2019s Shakespeare to be discovered here and actually the Brits are learning from the Americans about classics because there\u2019s such freedom. Zesty, free thinking about Shakespeare is devoutly to be wished. Having said that, what I am most excited about is bringing some of the rigour that I\u2019ve grown up with in terms of the language, the meaning, the nuance, and meeting a fresh curiosity about what Shakespeare means now, which this country so vividly asks, and bringing them together.\u201d\nLast year Godwin brought a touring RSC production of Hamlet to Washington\u2019s Kennedy Center. It was the company\u2019s first rendition of the play to feature a black actor, Paapa Essiedu, in the title role. \u201cWhat strange destiny it was that I ended up in Washington with that play just when they [Shakespeare Theatre Company] were searching for their new director,\u201d Godwin reflects. \u201cThat week I went to have my first meeting with the theatre here. It was important I could say explicitly that I might look like a white male, and indeed might be a white male, but my wish and my work is striving to be beyond that and be open to all kinds of influences and people and collaborators and voices.\u201d\nGodwin\u2019s inclusion of Baldwin and Jacobs-Jenkins suggest a desire to explore race relations at this most sensitive of times. \u201cPeople have mentioned to me in Washington that things move very fast here, that the news cycle and the dialogue about race and gender and power and appropriateness and meaning are all in a very quick and incendiary relationship.\n\u201cPerhaps in England there is Brexit, but even that seems be rather like a long and boring play as we\u2019re sort of chugging along, and stuff happens yet we\u2019re all so exhausted by it we just wish it would finish, whereas you can\u2019t afford to be asleep on your post in America, it seems.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cAnd yet I also have to maintain enormous modesty in terms of going, \u2018What does something mean? What is appropriate? What is the relationship? How does the relationship differ in terms of the British relationship with race and the American relationship with race.\n\u201cI should be very much a learner about that and find people that I can engage with and indeed artists and writers and actors and directors and academics who are African American, who I can actually say maybe the best thing is if you make work here and speak and share your feelings as much as me trying to make work for you. I need to clear out and give them the space and the power to speak, the agency to tell the stories that are going to count.\u201d",

The latest swimwear, from high-tech trunks to whimsical costumes, makes it easier than ever to take the plunge\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nNationwide, there is a boom in wild swimming. Even the fashion pack, rarely ones to embrace the great outdoors, have got involved. Anne-Marie Curtis, editor-in-chief of Elle, swims regularly at the Kenwood Ladies\u2019 Pond on Hampstead Heath in London, as does designer Louise Gray.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nNearby, writer Eliot Haworth of Fantastic Man magazine can be found braving the often icy water at the men\u2019s pond. \u201cI wear a pair of quite skimpy ultramarine Adidas Lycra trunks and nothing else,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are the same pair I bought when I was living in Finland and started going ice swimming. I find their utilitarian sportiness sets me in the right frame of mind for the task ahead. It might seem counterintuitive to bare more skin when it\u2019s cold, but I prefer to have as little wet clothing on me as possible. They also dry quicker.\u201d\nFour years ago, printmaker Katherine Anteney entered a triathlon. While training, she remembered how good swimming felt \u2013 the peace and the adrenaline, the pleasure of spreading your fingers wide in cool water or kicking your legs in a firm breaststroke. She began visiting lakes regularly. \u201cAt first I wore a wetsuit, but ditched that pretty quickly as it felt like it kept me removed from the water.\u201d\nI\u2019ve swum in the ladies\u2019 pond every week, all year round, for three years. My swimming partner, Sarah Regh, whom I met in the pond during my first ever visit, is an expert in unusual swimwear. Her current costume is covered in a bold shark print. \u201cIt\u2019s from Batoko and is made from recycled materials,\u201d she says. Her top tip is flip-flops for the dash from changing hut to water\u2019s edge. \u201cI would pick flip-flops over hat, gloves and swimsuit, any day; they are key to warming up quickly. They provide vital insulation between the ground and my body and allow me to focus on getting dry.\u201d\nToday, Anteney\u2019s favourite swimming spot is the river Test in Southampton. Even in the winter, she will swim a handful of times a month, and the local train now greets her and her swimming partner Pam with a hoot. \u201cWhere we get changed is called the Slab. It\u2019s a concrete culvert right next to the tracks on the mainline to Salisbury. We always get a honk and a wave. Those poor fellas have seen our bare bums too many times.\u201d\nAnteney advises swimming with a companion for camaraderie and motivation. \u201cWe swim upstream heads up and chatting, and then back with head-down crawl. In the winter, we wear woolly hats and I keep my glasses on, because then I have an excuse not to put my face in.\u201d Occasionally, they go in the dark with head torches. She would advise investing in neoprene shoes for warmth. \u201cI hate getting mud on my feet,\u201d she says. \u201cEarplugs help keep you warmer but they mean you can\u2019t do much chatting, so I\u2019ve stopped wearing them. I have learned the importance of getting warm quickly afterwards and anticipating the afterdrop (where your core temp carries on dropping after you get out). I couldn\u2019t live without my Dryrobe.\u201d This combines a windproof outer shell with a synthetic lambswool lining.\n\u201cSwimming is the new yoga,\u201d says the journalist and screenwriter Marion Hume. \u201cI love that fashion has finally \u2018got\u2019 swimwear to swim in, from Stella McCartney\u2019s whimsical pieces to Ashley Graham\u2019s, which are so body-positive.\u201d She prefers the comfort of a lido \u2013 just wild enough, without the risk of reeds or fish. \u201cI swim at Parliament Hill Lido, which is lined in metal that sparkles in the sun \u2013 it\u2019s like moving through a James Turrell art installation.\u201d Like Anteney, she recommends neoprene boots \u2013 \u201cI tell myself they are Margiela circa 1980s, when in fact they just look ridiculous.\u201d\nIf the thought of plunging into the cold \u2013 and open water often is cold, even in the warmer weather \u2013 in just a swimming costume fills you with horror, a wetsuit is always an option. Consider the thickness carefully, says consultant Charlotte Goodhart, who swims in the West Reservoir at Manor House, north London. \u201cMy advice would be to wear a wetsuit of at least 2mm thickness \u2013 the water might not feel that cold but you\u2019ll gradually get quite chilly \u2013 though gloves and socks aren\u2019t as necessary.\u201d\nBen Alden-Falcone is a sea man. He swims regularly along the Kent coast, in particular in the Walpole Bay Tidal Pool in Margate. Three years ago, he swam the Channel as part of a relay of three. \u201cI definitely got the short straw starting first in the pitch black of a very cold early morning. Then, on my next hour stretch as the sun came up, plume upon plume of red jellyfish surfaced. You couldn\u2019t swim round them \u2013 there were thousands. I got stung to bits \u2013 it looked like I had been whipped.\u201d\nUnlike Goodhart, he still wouldn\u2019t recommend a wetsuit: \u201cFor me, a wetsuit kills a key joy of cold-water swimming \u2013 the freedom. I want to feel the water, even if a twig or bit of seaweed makes me jump occasionally.\u201d He wears tight swimming shorts instead. And goose fat, for the Channel, surely? \u201cI think the goose fat is a bit of a rumour; we had Vaseline to stop chafing.\u201d He\u2019s a fan of ear plugs, but says the best preparation is temperature-checking. \u201cMy No 1 tip is always acclimatise to the water temperature (especially if you don\u2019t go regularly) by dipping your feet into the water for a couple of minutes first. This will cool your body temperature and reduce risk of a shock to the heart.\u201d\nBefore you grab your goggles, consider your swimming aims, says Anteney. \u201cThe last thing it\u2019s about is exercise,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about being in the water and feeling it all around you. Being at eye level with nature. An early-morning swim before work makes the rest of the day manageable. It keeps me sane \u2013 even though everyone else thinks we are insane.\u201d",

And they kept talking. For a few hours, their words kept Pell free.\nThe only question on the agenda today was how long the man who once bestrode the Catholic world will be living behind bars.\nIt seems Kidd hasn\u2019t warmed much to the cardinal in the eight months this case has been fought behind closed doors on the corner of William and Lonsdale streets, Melbourne.\n\u201cI want to make it plain I see this as a serious example of this level of offending,\u201d Kidd told the court. \u201cI see this as callous, brazen offending. Blatant. I think it did involve breach of trust, he did have in his mind some sense of impunity, how else did he think he was going to get away with this exploiting of two vulnerable boys. And there was an element of force here.\u201d\nRichter\u2019s last efforts won his client little sympathy. Kidd squirmed, snapped his glasses off and on, leant forward, leant back, put his chin on his fist and kept saying, one way or another: \u201cYou\u2019ve lost me Mr Richter.\u201d\nRichter never ceases complaining about the damage the press does his client yet all morning he threw headlines to the pack. The best of the worst: the crime at the heart of this case was \u201cNo more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not actively participating\u2026\u201d\nOn his last day of freedom Pell drew a crowded court. The world knew where to come and the place was packed. As always, the first on the scene were the Catholic women who turn out to every inquiry and trial to bear witness to the men and women destroyed and the children lost.\nThey are the implacable wounded.\nCarmel Rafferty was waiting for the doors to open. She was sacked years ago for trying to save her pupils at Doveton Primary from crazed Father Peter Searson. With her was Judy Courtin who has shepherded a little army of victims through the courts. And by their side, a cup of coffee in her hand, Chrissie Foster, the mother of two daughters raped by Father Kevin O\u2019Donnell. The cops used to say of O\u2019Donnell: \u201cHe was a two-a-day man.\u201d\nThe women filled half the seats when the guards opened the doors. As they settled there was an end of term sense in the air. Break up was only hours away. Journalists took what seats they could find.\nSitting quietly up the front was Detective Chris Reed, the Victorian policeman who has pursued Pell for the last four years. His work was also on trial here.\nPell hadn\u2019t dressed for prison. He wore the same clerical collar and black bib he always wore plus the cotton jacket which in another setting \u2013 on, say, the Amalfi Coast \u2013 would be the rig of a great cleric on holiday. Not today.\nTwo artists had turned up. We are forbidden to record a word or take photographs. Somehow that would bring the business of justice undone. But the ancient art of the court sketchers is still honoured by the courts. As the argument ground on, only they and the judge could look Pell in the face. It was clamped shut.\n\u201cI appear on behalf of the cardinal,\u201d said Richter. It was hardly news. He cuts a Hogwarts figure. Fuzzy, old fashioned and lethal is the look he\u2019s after.\nRichter brought a slim file of character references to the court. \u201cWe would have had hundreds if we had cast the net wider,\u201d Richter told Kidd. John Howard had written to commend George Pell. So had the law Professor Greg Craven already busy defending him in the Murdoch press.\nBut no Tony Abbott, the man who called Pell the greatest churchman in the land seems not to have been wanted on this occasion. Sad in its way.\nRichter\u2019s job was to bring down the bidding. The prosecutor, Mark Gibson, had set the upper limit at 10 years for each of the five counts of which Pell has been found guilty. It\u2019s an impossible total. But how low could Richter persuade the court to go?\nPell doesn\u2019t concede anything at all happened in the sacristy that day. So his lawyers were in the strange position of arguing what prison sentence might be appropriate for acts Pell claims never happened. The exercise for them is a grim hypothetical.\nBut did it help Pell to argue that the crime \u2013 if it happened \u2013 was a spur of the moment thing? There was no plotting, said Richter. No grooming. It was Pell, \u201cstumbling on something without time for reflection\u201d.\nKidd stopped him. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go ahead and do what he did without thinking about it. It may have been only a few seconds but people made choices and he did that and he continued to make choices over five minutes.\u201d\nRichter shifted ground. Pell was not, as he put his penis in that boy\u2019s mouth, acting as archbishop but only as a man. Mass had finished and that was the only reason Pell was at St Patrick\u2019s.\n\u201cThe only differential of power is that he is an adult \u2013 for reasons inexplicable \u2013 with an urge to do what he did,\u201d said Richter. \u201cHe is not abusing his position as archbishop but he is abusing his position \u2026 as a grown man.\u201d\nKidd was not impressed.\nIt got worse. Richter pointed out helpfully that (if Pell had in fact done anything at all) he exerted \u201cNo force greater than was required to achieve penetration.\u201d There were no physical injuries, no ejaculation, no recording of the offences and he did not commit them while on bail or parole.\n\u201cSo what if he wasn\u2019t on bail or parole,\u201d asked Kidd. \u201cIf he was on bail or parole he wouldn\u2019t be the archbishop of Melbourne.\u201d\nThe gallery was polite. Only occasionally were there gasps and laughter.\nRichter ended with a burst of praise for a man who has lived \u201ca life of service, kindness and generosity above and beyond that of a priest\u201d. He commended Pell\u2019s \u201cprivate not his bureaucratic character\u201d. He praised him as \u201cA man of compassion, a man who relates to everyone from prime ministers to street cleaners.\u201d\nHe begged Kidd not to punish his client for the sins of the Catholic church and Kidd replied: \u201cFrom where I am sitting the Catholic church is not on trial and I am not imposing a sentence on the Catholic church. I am imposing a sentence on Cardinal Pell for what he did.\u201d\nPell was sent through the door to the cells. Kidd made his own exit, his robes gathered around him and a look like death on his face. Helicopters hovered overhead with cameras hoping for a shot of Pell in a prison van.\nWe will see him again when the appeal begins, the grounds already being argued on the front pages of the papers. The lawyer Father Frank Brennan\u2019s defence of the cardinal in the Australian is being distributed to parents with kids at Catholic schools. How might a fair jury be empaneled if these attacks on the victim, the jury and the court continue month after month.\nBy then Pell will be in one of the prisons where Victoria houses paedophiles. He will know so many of the faces, so many priests and brothers who have done what he continues to deny having done himself. What reunions there will be.\nFor the first time since they shared the St Alipius presbytery at Ballarat in the 1970s, George Pell will be back under the same roof as the worst of the worst. He and Gerald Ridsdale will have so much to catch up on.",

        "content": "Streaming service to launch this year will feature archive shows and new commissions\nThe BBC and ITV have confirmed plans to join forces and launch a paid-for streaming service called BritBox by the end of this year, in an attempt to head off Netflix.\nNetflix is eating into the market share of traditional broadcasters, as audiences increasingly desert established channels and expect shows to be available instantly on streaming services.\nBritBox will mainly feature archive BBC and ITV shows, alongside new British commissions made especially for the service. There were no details on pricing; the announcement said it would be \u201ccompetitive\u201d.\nHowever, BritBox will not have the latest BBC and ITV shows, which will remain available through the catch-up BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub services. Other broadcasters are expected to join the service later, with Channel 4 known to have taken part in discussions, which were revealed by the Guardian last year.\nITV has pledged to invest up to \u00a365m in the joint venture over the next two years. The publicly funded BBC would not comment on whether it was putting a similar amount of money into the project.\nThe decision means British broadcasters are likely to stop licensing their archive material to services such as Netflix to try to drive subscribers to the new UK service, which will operate on a fraction of the budget of its deep-pocketed US rivals.\nThe ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said BritBox would be pitched as an add-on for British households that already had one streaming service: \u201cIt\u2019s complementary to Netflix because it\u2019s doing a very different thing.\u201d\nShe said Netflix commissioned shows on a global basis but BritBox\u2019s original material would be aimed at UK viewers: \u201cWhen we\u2019re commissioning content we\u2019re looking at it working in the UK specifically. It is a permanent, comprehensive home for the widest range of British content available in one place.\u201d\nThe decision to launch the service came a decade after Project Kangaroo, a proposal for a similar British cross-channel streaming service, was blocked on competition grounds. Many in the British TV industry blame the Competition Commission\u2019s decision for opening the door for Netflix to dominate.\nThis time around, the media regulator, Ofcom, said it welcomed the BritBox proposal because it wanted to see British broadcasters \u201ccollaborating to keep pace with global players, by offering quality UK content that\u2019s available to viewers whenever and however they want to watch it\u201d.\nBritBox is already available in the US, where it has 500,000 customers who pay for a selection of UK television shows. The new service will only be available to British subscribers. They will be able to watch it on holiday within the EU, but only if the government strikes a trade deal with Brussels.\nMcCall admitted the existing ITV Hub catch-up service was not good enough and \u201cvery clunky\u201d, but said ITV was investing heavily in improving it.\nShe said: \u201cIf you look at it today, the look and feel has already changed. It\u2019s much cleaner and nicer to be on. You\u2019ll also be led through it in a much better way. There\u2019s a whole load of things to come.\u201d\nITV programmes are available on ITV Hub for a month after their initial broadcast, in line with the BBC\u2019s iPlayer policy. However, the BBC is seeking approval to make many shows available on iPlayer for up to a year, which could affect when material becomes exclusively available on Britbox.\nThe announcement that talks on Britbox had almost concluded was timed to coincide with ITV\u2019s annual financial results, which show the broadcaster\u2019s profits dipped slightly in a tough market.\nThe company warned this year could be tougher, since 2018 was aided by strong advertising in a World Cup year and success in its production business, which makes shows for other channels, such as the BBC\u2019s Bodyguard.\nThe BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the streaming service would be \u201ctruly special\u201d. \u201cA new streaming service delivering the best homegrown content to the public who love it best,\u201d he said. \u201cThe service will have everything from old favourites to recent shows and brand new commissions. It\u2019s an exciting time for the viewing public.\u201d",

Sarri has said the club is working on being able to make summer signings \u2013 although whether he\u2019ll be around to reap the benefits is another matter. Calciomercato reports Fifa will not hold Roman Abramovich up for long \u2013 and that Chelsea could sign the Milan centre-back Alessio Romagnoli.\nIf the Blues are still tied up in red tape, then Manchester United could benefit. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r appears destined for the permanent gig at Old Trafford, and is targeting Romagnoli and the Barcelona playmaker Ivan Rakitic in a continental spending spree. It won\u2019t be three Rs, though, with the perma-linked Cristiano Ronaldo staying at Juventus.\nSpeaking of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema isn\u2019t missing him at Real Madrid. \u201cI played geared to Cristiano,\u201d he told France Football. \u201cI looked for him continually with the objective to help him score. Now I am the leader of the attack.\u201d Good for you, Karim. But what\u2019s this? Real linked with Harry Kane, Eden Hazard, Neymar and/or Paulo Dybala in a \u00a3300m+ attacking splurge? Oh Karim!\nGerard Deulofeu\u2019s hat-trick heroics have caught the attention of Milan, where he was on loan in 2017, and while the Spaniard says he\u2019s \u201cfocused on Watford\u201d, he\u2019s not entirely convincing. \u201cI was happiest at Milan,\u201d he told Mundo Deportivo. \u201cI felt very loved there, I enjoyed my football a lot.\u201d Watford may find a replacement from an unusual source \u2013 the club\u2019s president, Elton John, who fancies himself as a lower-league scout, according to the chairman, Scott Duxbury.\nArsenal are looking for a head of recruitment but if Sir Elton doesn\u2019t fancy it, they are targeting Roma\u2019s Monchi \u2013 having been firmly rebuffed by Ajax after chasing their technical director, the former Gunner Marc Overmars. Monchi may have even approved a move for the Lille winger Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, also wanted by United, Spurs and Wolves. \u201cWe are not a rich club,\u201d Lille\u2019s Lu\u00eds Campos told French media while waving a tiny white flag. \u201cIf a really good proposal comes in, we have to sell him.\u201d\nUnai Emery may also wave \u00a330m in Celtic\u2019s direction for the left-back Kieran Tierney, while in jarringly unrelated news, the Leipzig forward Jean-K\u00e9vin Augustin is attracting interest from Everton and Southampton. On the continent, Juventus like the look of the Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 but not the \u00a378m price tag, and Barcelona will continue the dismantling of Ajax\u2019s thrilling young team by signing the goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana.\nFinally, some done deals that look made up, but aren\u2019t. Sone Aluko has left Reading to join the Chinese Super League newcomers Beijing Renhe; Lacina Traor\u00e9, once at Everton, has rocked up at the Hungarian outfit Ujpest; and Greg Halford, released by Cardiff last summer, is back in the game with Aberdeen.",

        "content": "America\u2019s two-times Olympic gold medalist and Germany\u2019s longtime middleweight champion are fixed to unify all four belts in perhaps the most significant women\u2019s fight ever\nClaressa Shields leaned in with the all the bluster and braggadocio of an ascendant star fueled by boundless confidence. Christina Hammer sat back with a bemused smile, a picture of calm and self-assurance befitting a nine-year world champion who has heard it all before.\nThe most important women\u2019s boxing match in a generation or longer is back on, a delicious matchup between two of the world\u2019s best fighters at any weight defined by fascinating contrasts in styles, temperaments and experience levels.\nShields, the two-times Olympic gold medalist from the United States who\u2019s collected three of the major world title belts at 160lbs in the last 250 days, and Hammer, the German \u00e9migr\u00e9e from Kazakhstan who has owned the fourth for nearly a decade, will finally trade blows to decide an undisputed middleweight champion on 13 April at Atlantic City\u2019s Boardwalk Hall. The pair faced off on Tuesday at the Dream Downtown hotel in Manhattan\u2019s posh Chelsea neighborhood to formally announce the 10-round unification scrap, which had initially been scheduled for November only to be postponed after Hammer was forced to withdraw because of an undisclosed medical condition that has since been resolved.\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad she\u2019s showing up this time,\u201d the American scoffed, one of many provocations lobbed in her opponent\u2019s direction on the day. \u201cI want to make her quit. I don\u2019t want her to just know I\u2019m a good fighter. I want her to know I\u2019m great.\u201d\nShields (8-0, two KOs), the only US boxer to win multiple Olympic golds, is already a two-division world champion in the barely 27 months since her paying debut at super middleweight, armed with an animated invective to match her pressure style inside the ropes. She spent much of Tuesday\u2019s news conference on a high-spirited offensive before a friendly gallery, cavalierly picking away at Hammer\u2019s body of work and deriding the popular Dortmund boxer\u2019s side gig as a lingerie model.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to keep it a secret,\u201d she said. \u201c[Hammer] punches with her chin up in the air, she has a long jab, she does not know how to fight on the inside and she don\u2019t have balance with her legs. Have fun working on that for six weeks.\u201d\nHammer (24-0, 11 KOs), a classy operator who has made 12 successful defenses of the WBO middleweight title since winning it back in 2010, is a deft counter-puncher content to wait for openings and skilled at leveraging an opponent\u2019s aggression to her advantage, a patience mirrored by Tuesday\u2019s phlegmatic rhetorical tack.\n\u201cThis is a big risk to come from Germany to the US, but I believe the best should fight the best and I did what I had to so that this could happen,\u201d said the 28-year-old veteran, who is coming off a second-round knockout of Elene Sikmashvili in a stay-busy non-title bout earlier this month in Berlin. \u201cI want to show that strong women can do anything they want. It\u2019s a huge fight and it will inspire a lot of girls by showing they can also earn money in this sport.\u201d\nThe winner of April\u2019s summit meeting will become only the second undisputed four-belt champion in women\u2019s boxing history after Norway\u2019s Cecilia Br\u00e6khus, the welterweight queen widely regarded as the pound-for-pound world No 1 today. So rare is the feat in a decentralized sport all but engineered to keep the titles fractured (and the sanctioning fees churning) that only four men have managed it: the current cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk, junior welterweight Terence Crawford and middleweights Bernard Hopkins and Jermain Taylor.\nShowtime boxing czar Stephen Espinoza, who said he has thrown the premium cable network\u2019s full promotional heft behind the event, including a production of the glossy All-Access docuseries it typically reserves for pay-per-view affairs, described it as a \u201clong overdue\u201d showcase for women\u2019s boxing, which for years has been relegated to the margins even as Ronda Rousey lifted women\u2019s mixed martial arts from slagged-off sideshow to headline attraction.\n\u201cYou see in Mexico and Latin America that women\u2019s boxers are headlining televised cards all the time,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cIn fact, some of the highest ratings on Mexican television come from women\u2019s bouts. The same is true for Europe. So this is one area where the US market unfortunately is behind much of the rest of the world.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in this fight then, candidly, you\u2019re not a boxing fan. This is as good as this sport gets.\u201d\nFor all the well-documented external factors underpinning women\u2019s boxing\u2019s ongoing struggle for exposure, lack of network support chief among them, there has been no shortage of self-sabotage down the years. On Tuesday, Shields name-checked a pair of surefire blockbusters \u2013 Laila Ali v Ann Wolfe and Lucia Rijker v Christy Martin \u2013 that died on the vine despite years of chatter and mounting anticipation.\n\u201cThis is one of those superfights that\u2019s never happened before,\u201d said Shields, whose six-week camp will take place at the US Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs under trainer John David Jackson, a former two-division champion best known for his work with light heavyweight titleholder Sergey Kovalev. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had one like it in women\u2019s boxing. It\u2019s great to make this happen and us being from two different parts of the world makes this fight even better.\u201d\nA self-described \u201crose that grew from concrete\u201d, the magnetic Shields, who marked time while awaiting Hammer\u2019s recovery by outpointing Scotland\u2019s Hannah Rankin and Belgium\u2019s Femke Hermans for her seventh and eighth professional wins, has been cast on home soil as the clear A-side of the promotion. The 23-year-old from Flint, Michigan \u2013 a winner in 77 of her 78 amateur bouts \u2013 overcame a transient childhood, poverty and sexual abuse to become the first ever US boxer, male or female, to win consecutive gold medals at the Olympics with a star-making run in London, aged 17, and a compelling encore in Rio, where she earned the women\u2019s half of the Val Barker trophy as the top overall fighter in the competition, an honor not won by an American since Roy Jones Jr at Seoul 1988.\nYet the 5ft 11in Hammer, who said Tuesday she will begin training in Germany before shifting base in March to a more secluded camp in the Austrian mountains near Innsbruck, believes that she is more than capable of pressing her three-inch advantages in height and reach to halt Shields\u2019 dizzying rise and place a stamp on her own legacy as the finest middleweight of her era. She plans on enlisting more male sparring partners than for previous camps with an emphasis on high-volume crowders who can mirror the American\u2019s oppressive in-fighting style.\n\u201cShe goes forward always, she\u2019s very aggressive,\u201d said Hammer, who last year became the first German boxer to successfully defend a world title in the United States since Max Schmeling in 1931, an experience she said she deliberately ordered to help acclimate for a potential Shields bout. \u201cShe wants to push her opponent to the ropes and land some good shots, power shots. You have to be careful and use the thing what she\u2019s doing [against her]. I think she has more emotions than me in this fight. She hates me, I think. We may never have a friendship, but it\u2019s OK.\u201d\nWhen asked whether Shields\u2019 ill will is requited, Hammer betrays another smile.\n\u201cI feel nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionless. Because it\u2019s boxing. When I step into the ring, I\u2019m cold as ice and I want to finish this job.\u201d",

Harriet Tyce would consider this pure denial: what people really want from crime thrillers, suggests her smart debut, a #MeToo domestic noir, is much murkier and more debasing.\nTyce shows her protagonist in the moral greyscale she knows makes her more relatable. Alison is a successful London-based criminal lawyer whose drink problem doesn\u2019t seem to affect her professional capabilities. We are introduced to her as she\u2019s getting wrecked in the pub after work, then going on to a club where she tearfully accuses her colleague Patrick, a vicious but charismatic shit with whom she is having an affair, of flirting with a younger woman. She then heads back to her chambers to have blurred-lines sex with him on her desk (\u201cno don\u2019t stop don\u2019t stop, stop it hurts\u201d). Patrick leaves. Alison blacks out and is found there the following morning by her unsmiling husband, Carl, and six-year-old daughter, Matilda.\nOur sympathy shifts to Carl \u2013 but wait. Carl is an appalling self-righteous prig, a psychotherapist specialising in male sex addiction. Tyce has impish fun with this; I snorted at the moment when Carl earnestly steers Alison away from their sitting room because a member of his men\u2019s group is having a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d. His misogynistic rage expresses itself in myriad petty little ways, from gaslighting to parental showboating and wincing when he tastes food Alison has cooked (the kitchen being, he considers, his domain).\nAs Alison\u2019s marriage disintegrates, along comes a work opportunity \u2013 her first murder case. A wealthy woman, Madeline, repeatedly stabbed her sadistic, coercive husband in the bedroom of their Clapham townhouse. But there\u2019s more to the case than meets the eye. For one thing, Madeline\u2019s behaviour around Alison is decidedly odd and boundary-crossing. Then there are the anonymous abusive texts Alison starts receiving and disturbing revelations about Patrick that threaten to derail both the case and their relationship. A former lawyer herself, Tyce brings her fictional world to dark, unsettling life. An arguably off-key bit of plotting towards the end threw me slightly, but fans of Apple Tree Yard and The Girl on the Train will love the atmosphere of clenched ambiguity Tyce sustains so well.\n Blood Orange is published by Wildfire (\u00a312.99).

MLS can\u2019t match the history of local derbies elsewhere in the world, but no other league comes close in hyping up these games with amazing monikers. Last year, Los Angeles Football Club and the LA Galaxy played the first three El Traficos, and this season we get the debut of Hell Is Real between new boys FC Cincinnati and the revived Columbus Crew. CF\nHas there ever been so much to draw the eye ahead of an MLS season? How will Atlanta United evolve under Frank de Boer? What will a full year of Zlatan Ibrahimovic bring? Can Wayne Rooney carry his form over into 2019? How will the Matias Almeyda age pan out at San Jose? How will Toronto FC cope post-Sebastian Giovinco? Will FC Cincinnati sink or swim? What sort of impact will moving into Allianz Field have on Minnesota United? What about Nani at Orlando? There\u2019s just so much! GR\nThe crowds at FC Cincinnati. They were absolutely insane in USL in 2018 (averaging 25,717 per game, higher than all but three MLS teams) and promise to be this year\u2019s fan sensation, with all the debut-season hype and hoopla you can muster. SV\nThe Hell is Real rivalry. During their Cinderella US Open Cup run in 2017, FC Cincinnati packed 30,000 fans into Nippert Stadium for their match against the Crew. It felt like we would see the two in MLS soon. Columbus Crew\u2019s relocation detour threatened the rivalry, but Hell is Real is back. JF\nThe saber-rattling over a new collective bargaining agreement. The current CBA expires on 31 January 2020. Some US sports have figured how to get a new deal done without brinksmanship, but the soccer community has not yet reached that stage. BD\nSo many white secondary kits. More than half of the league\u2019s 24 teams will be wearing change strips that can only charitably be touted as \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cicy\u201d. Whether this is an attempt to further NFL-ify MLS with a color-at-home, white-on-the-road dress code, or a result of Adidas coasting on its league-wide uniform contract, it\u2019s an example of MLS\u2019s single-entity structure stamping out creativity. CF\nMore talk about the CBA. If a new agreement isn\u2019t reached, there could be a lockout. While the wellbeing and interests of players, particularly those lower on the ladder, need looking after, this is a decidedly unsexy, tedious topic. It won\u2019t make SportsCenter. GR\nThe new-look playoff format. I totally get the league wanting to avoid the 40-day marathon of 2018, but 13 games for 14 teams in 23 days is a battle for survival, not of optimum quality. SV\nThe \u201cbusiness metrics\u201d owners will complain about in advance of the 2020 CBA negotiations. While MLS players won a minor victory in 2015, it pales in comparison to the sums that owners are reaping. Nashville joins to the tune of a $150m expansion fee, and MLS now own a majority stake in the cash cow that is Soccer United Marketing. JF\nCosta Rica will defeat Mexico in the Gold Cup, Mexico will fire Tata Martino, and David Beckham\u2019s Inter Miami will immediately hire him. BD\nOnce he breaks every MLS record, Zlatan Ibrahimovic will tear down the David Beckham statue outside Dignity Health Sports Park and erect one of his own. OK, it\u2019s unlikely Zlatan will break every record, but with a full season as the focal point of the Galaxy attack, he\u2019ll eclipse Josef Mart\u00ednez\u2019s 31 regular-season goals from a year ago. Expect No32 to come on an overhead kick from near midfield. CF\nGreg Garza will modify his FC Cincinnati jersey to give it long sleeves. Adidas have done two things with their MLS designs this season - made every away jersey whiter than Donald Trump\u2019s White House, and cut long sleeves from their offerings. This was tragic news for Garza, who was reportedly born in a long-sleeve soccer jersey. At some point this season, he will take matters into his own hands. GR\nThe league abandons plans for Miami after south Florida politics combine to make any kind of deal for a stadium untenable. Not only do Inter Miami face more legal challenges to their latest (fifth) proposed site, there\u2019s no sign they can find a temporary home for 2020. MLS, after six fruitless years, says: \u201cEnough\u201d. SV\nZlatan scores 35 goals while LA Galaxy fail to make the playoffs. After rumors of another move, the eccentric striker decided to return to the floundering LA Galaxy where he\u2019s been the only star to live up to expectations. JF\nWayne Rooney. Sure, he had some good luck last year by arriving just in time for DC United to play most of their games at home, but he\u2019s clearly hungry for success in this league. BD\nRa\u00fal Ruid\u00edaz. After years of slow starts and white-hot finishes, the Sounders look ready to put in a full season as Supporters\u2019 Shield contenders. Ruid\u00edaz, Seattle\u2019s Peruvian center forward, will score tons of goals along the way and edge Ibrahimovic and Atlanta\u2019s Pity Mart\u00ednez for honors as the league\u2019s best player in 2019. CF\nCarlos Vela. On the basis of the first half of the 2018 season, the Mexican was MLS\u2019s MVP. But post World Cup, Vela faded and disappointed in the playoffs. There is no World Cup this year and Vela will have a better chance of keeping his form consistent over the whole season. GR\nRaul Ruidiaz. Backed by midfield trio Nicolas Lodeiro, Victor Rodriguez and a revitalized Jordan Morris, Ruidiaz is primed to turn a promising first half-season in MLS into a full year of goalscoring triumph. SV\nKaku. After a brilliant match in Champions League, the Red Bull star looks ready to return to the form that saw him register 14 assists last year. While overtures to Club America have soured some fans, there\u2019s no doubting his skill. With a proper off-season and an eye towards Europe, look for Kaku to make a larger splash this year.

Unlucky to lose in conference finals last year, and Peter Vermes won\u2019t let that happen again. BD\nNew York Red Bulls. They must replace midfielder Tyler Adams, who is currently bossing games in the Bundesliga, but a first-rate development system should make that possible. Following another full MLS campaign to get comfortable with ideas other than a fervent high press, the well-rounded Red Bulls, one of the league\u2019s original clubs, will finally win their first MLS Cup. CF\nSporting Kansas City. I struggle to see a more balanced roster in MLS this season. Atlanta United will likely be a force again, but it\u2019s difficult to truly know how they will react to the loss of Tata Martino and Miguel Almiron despite de Boer and Pity Martinez coming in. Sporting KC have, on the other hand, kept the same group of players together. If they have one weakness it is in the lack of a true No9. GR\nPeter Vermes has built a roster loaded with attacking talent and deep enough to survive a full MLS schedule and Champions League campaign. SV\nNew York Red Bulls. After three Shield wins that led to playoff exits, an off-season defined by continuity will be crucial. The Red Bulls extended the contracts of their entire back four. Chris Armas will have a full season at the helm and Mathias Jorgensen\u2019s arrival should relieve some scoring burden off Bradley-Wright-Phillips. The playoff changes play in the favor of the perennial top seeds. JF",

        "content": "In a new book, Hugh Ryan explores the untold history of queer life in Brooklyn from the 1850s forward, revealing some unlikely truths\nFor five years Hugh Ryan has been hunting queer ghosts through the streets of Brooklyn, amid the racks of New York\u2019s public libraries, among its court records and yellow newspaper clippings to build a picture of their lost world.\nThe result is When Brooklyn Was Queer, a funny, tender and disturbing history of LGBT life that starts in an era, the 1850s, when those letters meant nothing and ends before the Stonewall riots started the modern era of gay politics.\nThe book grew out of Ryan\u2019s other project, The Pop-Up Museum of Queer History, a sort-of travelling museum that creates installations celebrating the histories of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\nRyan and his friends had done shows about local queer history in other cities but never in Brooklyn, where many of them lived. When they decided that they should do a Brooklyn event, they put out a call for information and got little reply. \u201cPeople just didn\u2019t know Brooklyn\u2019s queer history,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cI thought I\u2019d just go to the library, get the book about queer Brooklyn history. It\u2019s probably from the 1970s and all of 10 people have read it. There wasn\u2019t one.\u201d\nRyan started collecting information and then got a grant from the Martin Duberman Fellowship in LGBT studies at the New York Public Library. \u201cThey said to me when you are done with this grant you should have your book proposal written.\u201d\nOne recurring theme in his research that fascinated Ryan was how Brooklyn\u2019s rise from rural backwater to New York\u2019s second city mirrored the rise in interest in sex and gender studies and \u2013 sadly \u2013 the rise in homophobia, bigotry and abuse.\nConstruction on the Brooklyn Bridge started in 1869, the same year that human rights campaigner and journalist Karl-Maria Kertbeny first used the terms homosexual and heterosexual.\nShortly before that, the Erie Canal finally connected the city to the Great Lakes, bringing jobs and the urbanization that allowed queer life to flourish \u2013 especially along Brooklyn\u2019s waterfront.\n\u201cBrooklyn\u2019s growth runs along the same timeline as the evolution of our modern ideas about sexuality,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cYou could chart the two against each other. I used Brooklyn as an example of how things were developing in the world and America generally.\u201d\nThe book is studded with the stories of Brooklyn-based A-list gays of yesteryear: Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, Truman Capote. Then there is The February House \u2013 a Brooklyn townhouse that was once home to WH Auden, Benjamin Britten, Carson McCullers and Gypsy Rose Lee and which also hosted Salvador Dal\u00ed, his fearsome wife and muse Gala, and the writers Paul and Jane Bowles (a cast that would make the most cerebral Celebrity Big Brother house ever).\nBut the book also excels in uncovering what life was like for \u201cordinary\u201d queer folk such as Loop-the-Loop, a trans woman and sex worker from Brooklyn at a time when \u201ctrans\u201d was not part of the vocabulary (Loop preferred \u201cfairy\u201d) and Coney Island\u2019s working-class gay bath houses.\nMuch of the information Ryan gathered was from sources who hated the LGBT community \u2013 and increasingly so as it was studied and categorized.\nOne of those groups was the Committee of 14, a group of morally righteous New Yorkers who drove for prohibition, then against (straight) prostitution and, on discovering the queer community, went after them, too.\n\u201cThey were crazy,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cOn the one hand I am glad they existed because otherwise the records they kept wouldn\u2019t have existed but at the same time it\u2019s shocking. They were a very strange group of people.\u201d\nOne of the fascinating aspects of the book is how accepted the queer community was in Brooklyn at certain periods (and by certain people). During prohibition, gay and straight bars merged while during the war, queer life flourished as sailors poured into town, categories were looser than today and \u2013 again with caveats \u2013 there was acceptance.\n\u201cBefore World War II, especially in 1920s, there were a lot more spaces where queer and non-queer people mixed,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThere was even this period \u2018the pansy craze\u2019 where it was fashionable to have limp-wristed men in movies who may have been gay or trans or entirely outside that in movies.\u201d\nBut as queer profiles rose, so did the backlash. The repeal of prohibition drove gays and straight apart and the queers went underground where the police \u2013 and the mafia \u2013 came after them.\nAmerica\u2019s love affair with eugenics, the \u201cscience\u201d of improving the population by controlled breeding, caught up with the queer community as it had with people of color. Queers were dangerous to the health of the nation, easily blackmailed, not to be trusted. They were driven out of public life, academia, the movies; society turned against them.\nBy the 1940s, thousands of men would be arrested each year for \u201cdegeneracy\u201d. In 1942, Senator David Ignatius Walsh\u2019s career was destroyed in a sensational sex scandal that involved rumours that he had frequented a gay Brooklyn brothel that was being used by Nazi spies. The New York Post, which had fought for the US to join the war against Germany when Walsh was set against it, broke the story which became known as \u201cSwastika swishery\u201d.\nRyan thinks Walsh was probably gay but that the claims he attended the brothel were dubious.\nThe brothel\u2019s owner, Gustave Beekman, and several others were arrested. Beekman cooperated with the authorities but still received a 20-year sentence in Sing Sing for sodomy and wasn\u2019t released until 1963.\n\u201cThe legacy of all of this is when we get this turn towards homophobia \u2013 45 to Stonewall or the early 80s \u2013 there is this really negative idea that gay life is sad, small, limited, dirty, painful, persecuted. And I think that we have internalized that. Anytime before Stonewall that was what gay life was, when really it was just what gay life was like when gay life was becoming speakable in most of America and was getting its history written,\u201d says Ryan.\n\u201cWe have this ahistoric idea that what life was like in 1957 was \u2018What Life Was Like\u2019 for gay people.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that now. Today Brooklyn is arguably the epicenter for queer New York culture, vibrant, diverse, out and proud. It\u2019s awesome,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s more diverse than it\u2019s ever been. More powerful. I think people are paying attention. what happens in Brooklyn sets the tone \u2013 and not just in queer culture.\u201d\nBut is it sustainable? Can we keep the gains we have while we strive for more?\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell. There is an amount of retrenchment that happens anytime there is progressive gains. We are always on a pendulum. I worry about that but I do think that some things have changed forever.\u201d\nThere\u2019s probably no better time for us to relearn Brooklyn\u2019s queer history.\nWhen Brooklyn Was Queer is released on 5 March",

Founded on 27 February 1900 from the fledgling socialist and trade union movements, it grew to become one of the world\u2019s most influential political forces of the left, and remains the biggest of any party by membership in western Europe. But last week saw of nine of its MPs resign \u2013 eight of whom, along with three Tories, have formed a new alignment known as the Independent Group. With Brexit and social decline driving British politics to the margins, both Labour and the Tories are now at risk of fractures that could shatter the country\u2019s familiar two-party landscape. Our cover story this week asks how Labour, in particular, can survive the bitter infighting surrounding its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his seemingly ambivalent attitude both to Brexit and to alleged antisemitism within the party.\nA major problem faced by the world today is how to reverse the deep social and environmental damage caused by consumer capitalism. In this edition we take in-depth looks at the cultivation of palm oil and cocoa, the base ingredients for multibillion-dollar industries ranging from chocolate to fuel to shampoo. None of which might mean much to cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast, who earn on average less than $1 a day. In our Spotlight opener, the Observer\u2019s Tim Adams reports on how Ivorian farming cooperatives hope to get a better deal through initiatives such as Fairtrade.\nThen, Paul Tullis asks whether we can ever wean ourselves off palm oil, and spare the world the catastrophic environmental damage caused by its mega-plantations.\nShamima Begum is a London schoolgirl who ran away to Syria to join Islamic State aged 15. Now, four years later, with the terrorist group all but destroyed in Syria, Begum wants to return to the UK with her newborn baby. Many in the UK sympathised with the government\u2019s decision last week to revoke her British citizenship. But, as Gary Younge argues, the decision is not as simple as that. On a more hopeful note, we visit the commune helping Yazidi women who were prisoners of Isis to repair their lives.\nBack in the day Chaka Khan was known as the Queen of Funk, and now aged 65, she is showing no signs of slowing up. She has had her fair share of music industry ups and downs but she tells Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis why her new album, Hello Happiness \u201chas put a new spark in my career\u201d.\nSubscribe here",

        "content": "Friendly tournaments do not always inspire but the SheBelieves Cup has gone beyond the standard fare. Now in its fourth year, the tournament brings together four of the top international teams in women\u2019s football, with the USA \u2013 the host nation \u2013 the constant.\nThis year, as the USA, England, Japan and Brazil prepare to take the field in Philadelphia, Nashville and Tampa, the competition offers a glimpse at their World Cup credentials. The decision of the BBC to broadcast all of England\u2019s pre-World Cup friendlies \u2013 split between BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Four \u2013 means all of the SheBelieves Cup will be free to air.\nAs well as a look at how Phil Neville\u2019s Lionesses stack up against the World Cup holders, the USA, we will also see how well they handle the 2015 World Cup runners-up, Japan, whom they will also face in Group D this June in France.\nThe England manager is sticking with players already in the fold, yet to be swayed by the form of Chelsea\u2019s top scorer, Beth England, or Birmingham\u2019s defensive rock Aoife Mannion.\nNeville\u2019s decision not to include the 24-year-old England \u2013 who has signed a new deal at Chelsea that keeps her at Kingsmeadow until 2021 \u2013 in his plans could prove costly, despite his insistence that his team is picked on form and performance.\nThe Lionesses benefit from some of the finest attacking talent in the world, with the WSL\u2019s all-time top scorer, Nikita Parris, and Barcelona\u2019s Toni Duggan currently the squad\u2019s in-form forwards. But is that enough? Faith in Birmingham\u2019s Ellen White and Chelsea\u2019s PFA player of the year, Fran Kirby, poses challenges. They are both credible starters when fit but have struggled with injury. White only recently returned from a back problem while Kirby is not long back after damaging a hamstring in November. Their fresher legs could well be a boon come June, but they need to find their feet quickly and to be match fit straight away. It is a risk.\nThe loss of Jordan Nobbs to an ACL rupture at Everton in November was a huge blow to England\u2019s hopes in France. As a precaution, Jill Scott \u2013 who is even more vital to the midfield in the absence of the creative powerhouse Nobbs \u2013 has been left behind \u201cin order to manage her return to full fitness ahead of this summer\u2019s World Cup\u201d, according to the FA.\nFirst up on Wednesday in Chester, Pennsylvania, are Brazil, whom England beat in October, a Fran Kirby strike in the second minute giving England victory at Meadow Lane. The South Americans pose the easiest of the challenges in this tournament, having lost five of their six friendlies since securing Word Cup qualification \u2013 as well as the defeat to Neville\u2019s side, they have been beaten by Canada, France, US and Australia.\nMarta, five times world player of the year, is still capable of moments of brilliance but is not in the form that led to her being labelled the best woman to have ever played. Formiga, who will be playing in her seventh World Cup should she make the plane and turns 41 on 3 March, rolled back the years when the two sides met last year, her and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Ludmila the brightest sparks in a largely tame performance.\nThen from below freezing temperatures, England head to the warmer climes of Nashville to face the USA on Saturday. It is hard to bet against the Americans retaining the title they won in 2015. Unbeaten in 2018, they fell to an unexpected defeat to France in their first game of the new year \u2013 the 3-1 scoreline not doing justice to how comprehensively they were outclassed. Yet they will probably be unfazed, and it has provided a valuable insight into the side that could prove to pose the biggest threat to a repeat trophy. The Portland Thorns midfielder Lindsey Horan has missed out on selection because of a thigh injury, giving Samantha Mewis, McCall Zerboni, Emily Fox and Andi Sullivan the chance to stake a claim for a seat on the plane in June.\nThe head coach of Japan, Asako Takakura, has a fine balance of experience at her disposal, with Lyon\u2019s Saki Kumagai and Inac Kobe Leonessa\u2019s Aya Sameshima there to balance younger players who helped lift the Under-20 Women\u2019s World Cup in France last year along with Endo Jun, who has been called from the Under-19 squad.\nEngland conclude their matches against Japan, in Tampa on Tuesday. With World Cup Group D containing these two as well as Scotland and Argentina, the matches at SheBelieves could give a strong indication of the balance of forces within the group.",

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU\n\u201cHow many defenders have scored a hat-trick from open play?\u201d asks Jack Tanner.\nNot that many, is the short answer, if our pretty extensive search is anything to go by, Jack. There are few defenders who have achieved the feat with the aid of a penalty, Denis Irwin, Fernando Hierro and \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 Gary Gillespie among them. And then we move on to examples of defenders who achieved the feat from open play but not while playing in a defensive position. For some reason we can\u2019t fathom, Steve Staunton, a left-back for most of his career, leapt off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick for Liverpool at Wigan in the League Cup in October 1989, but he replaced Ian Rush in a forward position. No defender has scored a hat-trick in the Premier League, though Steve Watson, converted from a full-back into an attacking midfielder by David Moyes at Everton, did the trick in a 4-0 win over Leeds in 2003 so is about as close as it gets (Irwin\u2019s Manchester United hat-trick came in Europe).\nBut if we want a perfect example to answer the question, how about goal-plundering centre-back Aden Flint, who scored three goals from open play for Bristol City in an extraordinary 8-2 walloping of beach-bound Walsall on 3 May 2015, as City celebrated winning League One in style. Flint\u2019s goals consisted of a volley, an insouciant back-heel/rabona finish (obviously) and a close-range tap-in. \u201cI said to the strikers at the end of the game that they should be ashamed of themselves when someone like Aden has gone out there and scored three,\u201d cackled manager Steve Cotterill. Flint scored 15 in total for the season. No wonder Middlesbrough forked out \u00a37m for him.\n\u201cFormer central defender and current conservative politician Alpay \u00d6zalan scored three goals from open play for Turkey during 2002 World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia,\u201d writes \u00d6nder Susam. \u201cThe then-Aston Villa player scored two headers and poked one into the empty net, which was from an offside position. Those were his only goals for Turkey in any official game. I wish he was remembered for this rather than his antics against Portugal in Euro 2000 or his shambolic defending against Switzerland in a 2006 World Cup play-off.\u201d\nHere\u2019s Chelsea centre-back Magdalena Eriksson scoring a hat-trick of headers from corners for Sweden against Iran in 2016. One, two, three \u2026\nVarf\u00f6r \u00e4ndra ett framg\u00e5ngsrecept? Magdalena Erikssons hattrick var exakta kopior av varandra! https://t.co/s7ESkOw4iY\nOh, and Stan van den Buijs scored a hat-trick for Anderlecht in January 1995. The trouble is, he was playing for Germinal Ekeren, the poor chap.\nHowever, Bernd Jatzwauk has unearthed a four-goal gem from the Bundesliga. \u201cBernard Dietz scored four goals as a defender for MSV Duisburg against Bayern Munich on 5 November 1977.\u201d They came in the 20th, 49th, 75th and 78th minutes in the 6-3 win. \u201cHe went on to become the most prolific goalscoring defender in the history of the Bundesliga with 77 goals.\u201d None appear to have been penalties or free-kicks.\n\u201cI was listening to the BBC\u2019s World Football podcast recently where Pat Nevin shared the surprise news that he and Terry Butcher are cousins,\u201d reports Michael Fryer. \u201cDoes anyone know of any other cousins who played for different countries?\u201d\nTurns out there are plenty of examples. \u201cMark Chung and Craig Ziadie are cousins,\u201d writes Dan Ryazansky. \u201cChung was born in Canada, but played 24 games for the US. Ziadie was born in the US, but played 26 games for Jamaica. Both played for the MetroStars (now New York Red Bulls): Chung between 1999 and 2001, and Ziadie between 2002 and 2004.\nDirk Maas points us in the direction of Mark Viduka (Australia) and Luka Modric (Croatia). Unlikely relations you might think, but they are cousins through the former Leeds striker\u2019s father, Joe, who emigrated from Croatia in the 1960s. Dirk has done his homework, adding that Marcos Assun\u00e7ao (Brazil) and Marcos Senna (Spain) are cousins, as are Manuel Fernandes (Portugal) and Gelson Fernandes (Switzerland), and Granit Xhaka (Switzerland) and Armando Sadiku (Albania).

He only ever managed one team in a final, the infamous 1991 game, in which Paul Gascoigne was carried off, and Tottenham won 2-1 after an own goal from Des Walker.\u201d\n\u201cCesc F\u00e0bregas is linking up really well with Dennis Bergkamp, a man old enough to be his father,\u201d wrote Rob Coke, in August 2004. \u201cWhat is the greatest age difference between two team-mates in English football?\u201d\nCesc F\u00e0bregas (17) and Dennis Bergkamp (35) dovetailed gloriously in Arsenal\u2019s storming start to the 2004-05 season. But they were nowhere near the record. In the absence of any cold, hard facts on the subject, we had to settle for a couple of examples: during USA 94, Roger Milla (42) and Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 (19) lined up alongside each other for Cameroon. But no tale of old and young team-mates would be complete without the word \u2018Beasant\u2019: Big Dave (43) and Leighton Baines (17) both took part in Wigan\u2019s LDV Vans Trophy defeat to Doncaster in November 2002.\n\u201cWhich other players have \u2018done a Kepa\u2019 and refused to be substituted,\u201d wonders George Jones.\nIt's not uncommon to see a player ask to be substituted due to injury, but has a player ever sought to come off because they're just playing really badly?\n\u201cLeicester\u2019s sacking of Claude Puel has left loanee signing Youri Tielemans in an unusual situation,\u201d begins Padraic McCafferty. \u201cThe Belgian played under both Leonardo Jardim and Thierry Henry at Monaco and will soon be playing under his fourth club manager in a single season.

        "content": "Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada\u2019s first indigenous attorney general, will testify over claims Trudeau aides pressured her to let a firm escape prosecution\nIn recent weeks, an archival clip from a 1983 constitutional conference on indigenous rights has circulated widely in Canada. The footage shows the Kwakwaka\u2019wakw lawyer Bill Wilson sitting across from the then prime minister, Pierre Trudeau \u2013 the father of the country\u2019s current leader.\nWilson tells Trudeau that both of his daughters want to become lawyers \u2013 and even prime minister. The audience \u2013 and Trudeau \u2013 laugh.\nThirty-six years later, one of those daughters has become the central figure in a scandal which continues to inflict political damage on Justin Trudeau and his government.\nJody Wilson-Raybould, who was the country\u2019s first indigenous attorney general and minister of justice, is scheduled to testify on Wednesday in front of parliament\u2019s justice committee, speaking publicly for the first time on allegations that the prime minister\u2019s closest aides improperly pressured her to abandon fraud and bribery prosecutions for a large Canadian engineering firm.\nMany believe that her refusal to acquiesce cost her a job.\nThose who know Wilson-Raybould, a lawyer from British Columbia, see a person who doesn\u2019t shy away from her principles.\nShe signed her resignation letter from the cabinet with the name Puglaas, which means \u201cwoman born to noble people\u201d in the Kwak\u2019wala language. The name was given her by her grandmother in a potlatch naming ceremony and brings with it a deep sense of dignity and obligation.\nWilson-Raybould\u2019s sister, Kory Wilson, told the Guardian the two were brought up with a strong sense of pride in their heritage.\n\u201cAs kids growing up in our family, we were raised to know that you have a responsibility to make a difference and use whatever skills and abilities you have to help others,\u201d she said.\nGrand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs described Wilson-Raybould as a \u201cwoman of integrity and principle\u201d for the work she did for indigenous communities as an elected region chief.\nWhen Wilson-Raybould was given two of the highest positions in the country \u2013minister of justice and attorney general \u2013 the feeling was \u201cabsolutely incredible\u201d for the family, said Kory Wilson.\n\u201cThat was the first time that an indigenous voice would be represented at that highest level. Does that mean that things will happen and change overnight? No, of course not. But the potential was there and the hope was there.\u201d\nTrudeau\u2019s decision to bring a well-respected indigenous lawyer into Ottawa\u2019s inner circle was seen as proof that his government was attempting to reset its relationship with indigenous peoples \u2013 and also bring credibility to his administration.\nA photo of Wilson-Raybould embracing Trudeau in the House of Commons quickly became emblematic of the perceived shift in tone towards indigenous peoples.\nBut the honeymoon period between Canada\u2019s indigenous people and the Trudeau government slowly shifted to a more confrontational relationship; despite the fanfare around his government\u2019s plan to overhaul the country\u2019s relationship with indigenous peoples, the legislation has been abandoned and is unlikely to become law.\nMeanwhile, although Wilson-Raybould won plaudits for her commitment to reconciliation efforts, she has also come under criticism for a handful of legal decisions which critics believe will have problematic implications in years to come.\nCivil rights groups say the drunk driving and cannabis laws introduced by her office disproportionately target ethnic minorities.\nStill, her demotion from the post came as a surprise to many.\n\u201cWhen Jody was kicked in the teeth by the prime minister, and shuffled down to veterans affairs, as important as it is, that was a clear slap in the face for all Indians across the country,\u201d her father told the CBC, calling his daughter \u201ca woman of integrity\u201d.\nIn February, the Globe and Mail reported she had been pressured by the prime minister\u2019s closest advisers to avert the prosecution of the engineering giant SNC Lavalin for bribery and fraud.\nThe prime minister publicly denied that was the case and suggested Wilson-Raybould\u2019s continued presence in cabinet indicated the two had an amicable relationship. Hours later, Wilson-Raybould resigned.\nIn the weeks that followed, Wilson-Raybould became the target of a smear campaign: administration staff and party loyalists told the Canadian Press she was \u201cdifficult\u201d to work with, self-centred and prone to anger. She was also featured in editorial cartoons that were widely panned as racist and sexist \u2013 which the prime minister subsequently condemned.\nThroughout the affair, she has remained silent and resisted becoming a foil for opposition parties seeking to capitalize on the feud with the prime minister.\nThat will change on Wednesday afternoon, when she is slated to deliver a 30-minute opening statement to the justice committee \u2013 three times longer than is normal.\nSo far, the prime minister appears determined to weather the self-inflicted storm, but those who know Wilson-Raybould believe he may have picked the wrong battle.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it, he picked a fight with the wrong individual,\u201d Grand Chief Phillip said. \u201cShe\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\u201d",

        "content": "Even by the standards of non-apology apologies, Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s first effort to address The Unpleasantness during Sunday\u2019s League Cup final refined an art form. Politicians everywhere should draw inspiration from the Chelsea keeper, whose decision to decline to be substituted by Maurizio Sarri is regarded by some as the harbinger of Britain\u2019s complete social breakdown (more on that possibility later).\nFirst, though, to events at Wembley Stadium. As Kepa put it in a statement issued in the immediate wake of the action: \u201cI regret how the end of the match has been portrayed.\u201d As always with these passive formulations, one is left to surmise who or what is the subject of the verb. In this case, given the verb in question is \u201cportrayed\u201d and the events in question were taking place on the medium of live television, delivered in real time via multiple camera angles, the subject of the verb is basically \u201cyour own eyes\u201d. Kepa is accusing your own eyes of stitching him up.\nIn some ways, this apology template is simply a new and improved version of apologising to \u201canyone who may have been offended\u201d. The latter classic formulation also suggests the entire thing is somehow the fault of the offendee, who has taken an active decision to lose their shit \u2013 a decision that the bigger person is now wearily having to deal with.\nHowever \u2013 and inevitably, perhaps \u2013 the above turned out not to be Kepa\u2019s last apology on the subject. Late on Monday night, a formal Chelsea statement was forthcoming, in which the \u00a371m keeper took another run at the situation. \u201cI have thought a lot more about yesterday\u2019s events,\u201d this asserted. \u201cAlthough there was a misunderstanding, on reflection, I made a big mistake with how I handled the situation.\u201d Now you tell us. The news comes as something of a guilt trip for those of us who had already sent our own eyes to bed with no supper for their inaccurate portrayal.\nThe wider issue, of course \u2013 and there must always be a wider issue! \u2013 is what Sunday\u2019s drama of insubordination means for football. Does the game\u2019s Doomsday Clock stand at two minutes from anarchy? Should dissenting players be keelhauled, as pirate mutineers once were, but which would now involve being dragged beneath and round the chassis of a Bugatti Chiron (quite a squeeze)? There seems to be a developing consensus in some quarters that footballers are these days multimillion-pound corporations, whose power and private staff will eventually relegate all managers to junior personnel.\nI have some sympathy with the notion that managers are not quite what they used to be. But blaming it all on player power seems to look the wrong way, when the players too are grist to much bigger mills.\nThe brilliant film writer David Thomson (a lifelong Chelsea supporter, as it happens) has written interestingly of what happened to footballers once the game became primarily a televised spectacle, and particularly since the technical innovations and multiple camera angles that the likes of Sky have brought. Long ago the stadium fans were a player\u2019s only audience, but elite footballers now \u201cknow they are part of a system of close-ups and slow-motion\u201d. Hugely performative goal celebrations would have been regarded as bad taste in the past; today they are what the medium demands. Players have become far more theatrical to adapt to the small screens via which they are mostly seen \u2013 and so have managers, as Sarri\u2019s operatic gesticulations on Sunday also demonstrated.\nEven were it not so bound up with the big money, that specific consciousness of oneself as a TV star arguably made footballers more individualistic and less bound by the sense of subservience to a team. Furthermore, the marketers\u2019 attempts to reach and ensnare vast global audiences has deliberately exacerbated the notion of football as a dramatic TV show rather than \u201cmerely\u201d a sport. Plotlines are spoken of and personal rivalries played up in a fashion once the preserve of soap opera.\nBut football is no longer just a TV event; it is now a social media one, too. Executives at leading clubs speak unabashedly of \u201ccontent\u201d, which might be actual football, but might equally be some made\u2011for\u2011Instagram stunt. The biggest club brands consider themselves to be in the entertainment industry.\nTo an extent we have yet to understand fully, we have all been corrupted by the mediums via which we mostly experience football \u2013 first television, but now social media. And increasingly, we all collude in our own corruption. The Sarri-Kepa bust-up was widely reviewed as the most watchable two and a half minutes of Sunday\u2019s final \u2013 and you could tell this, because people were lighting up social media with the observation. You don\u2019t get that with 30 minutes of serviceable but uneventful play \u2013 much to the disappointment of the various platforms, whose business model relies on drama. In as turbo-capitalist an environment as top\u2011flight football, then, you have to assume the market will instinctively adapt and provide this type of content more and more. There are plenty of modern football executives who will privately admit that a killer clip is more important than any match for driving global fan engagement and value for their sponsors.\nPerhaps this is why Chelsea as a club feels able to \u201cmove past\u201d the histrionics of Sunday. It might have been a headache for the manager, but he\u2019s only at best a supporting actor. For the big studio moneymen, that two-and-a-half-minute clip was an excellent day at the office. Drama \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t really matter what sort \u2013 is always a great result.",

        "content": "It is six years since Paul Nicholls enjoyed what could be seen as a \u2018good\u2019 Cheltenham Festival but the trainer leading the title race now has his most powerful team for years\nIt is six years since Paul Nicholls has enjoyed what could be seen as a \u201cgood\u201d Cheltenham, when Rock On Ruby and Big Buck\u2019s took the Champion Hurdle and Stayers\u2019 Hurdle, respectively, in 2012.\nAt the six Festivals since, he has saddled 11 winners: two each in the Fred Winter, Grand Annual, Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle and Foxhunters\u2019, one in the County Hurdle, one Coral Cup and a Champion Chase with Dodging Bullets in 2015.\nNicholls has also finished the campaign as champion trainer in three of those years, so a good Cheltenham is not necessarily a pre-requisite for a successful season. All the same, a step up on his return from recent Festivals will probably be essential if Nicholls is to maintain his current lead of around \u00a3400,000 over Nicky Henderson and claim his first title for three years. The bookies still make him a narrow second-favourite to do so at around 6-4, and on Tuesday he showed off the horses he hopes will help to prove the layers wrong.\nClan Des Obeaux (Gold Cup): Touch wood, everything has gone to plan, he looks great, came out of the race [at Ascot last time] very well and he is just progressive. He was still learning about the job last year, but now we are where we want to be. He is a more experienced horse who has matured and has done the talking himself on his last two runs. Out of all the horses in the Gold Cup, he is the improving youngster. A lot of his rivals are exposed horses \u2013 we don\u2019t know where Clan Des Obeaux will end up.\nFrodon (Gold Cup/Ryanair Chase): I will confirm him for both and then will make a plan what we run him in depending on who is going to run in what race. We will run him in the race where we think he has the best chance. He is a tough horse who keeps on improving. He jumps and gallops and is rated 169 now having taken his form to a new level this year and is up there with the best \u2013 he will give a good account of himself whatever.\nGrand Sancy (Supreme Novice Hurdle): He\u2019s had a great season and after being narrowly beaten in the Tolworth, he won well in the Kingwell Hurdle, beating Sceau Royal and Vision Des Flos. He gave them weight at Wincanton and really toughed it out with a good performance for a novice. He looks fantastic and has come out of the race well.\nGive Me A Copper (Ultima Chase): He is a very talented horse. He came back at Sandown the other day with a big weight and ran a real good fourth. He travelled and jumped well before getting a bit tired from the back of the second last. The plan is to go for the Ultima and then hopefully onto the Grand National.\nTopofthegame (RSA Chase): Topofthegame has entries in both the RSA Chase and the JLT Novice Chase, but he is almost certain to run in the RSA. He finished second at Kempton over Christmas to La Bague Au Roi and that is good form. We purposely haven\u2019t run him since, he goes well fresh and we\u2019re looking forward to running him. He is a high-class chaser in the making, jumps nicely, has lots of class and is one of our big chances.\nQuel Destin (Triumph Hurdle): He has won his last five races for us, having got beat at Chepstow first time up when he was inexperienced. He\u2019s not been beaten since, has won a couple of Grade Two races including at Cheltenham and also won a Grade One at Chepstow in December. He is a proper tough four-year-old which you need in a Triumph. This lad has it all and is a proper jumping horse.\nPic D\u2019Orhy (Triumph Hurdle): His mark in this country based on his French form is 149 and he is a possible for the Triumph. He is a proper, big chasing type of horse who we bought with the future in mind. We took him to Wincanton last week for a racecourse gallop and we were thrilled with what we saw. I will either go straight for the Triumph with him or go to Aintree.\nPacha Du Polder (Foxhunters): He seems to know when to go at Cheltenham. This will be his last run unless Andy [Stewart, his owner] changes his mind. and Megan [Nicholls, the trainer\u2019s daughter] will then have him for hunting. He is brilliant at that so he will always have a good home here.\nWeld Al Emarat (4.10) is well worth an interest at around 3-1 in a useful handicap on the Fibresand at Southwell. Mick Easterby\u2019s runner has won two of his last three starts at this track and put up his best performance to date over this trip last time out.\nHarbour Quay (3.05) can go one better on a good second on handicap debut last time, while Statistical (2.20) and Chef D\u2019Equipe (2.50) should both go well on the card at Wincanton.\nWincanton \n\n1.20 Champagne Mystery \n1.50 Ostuni \n2.20 Statistical \n2.50 Chef D'Equipe \n3.25 Collooney \n3.55 Ted Bach \n4.30 Tikkapick \n5.00 Risk A Fine \nMusselburgh \n\n2.10 John Williams \n2.40 Landsman \n3.15 Call The Cops \n3.45 Henry's Joy \n4.20 Wot A Shot \n4.50 Tokaramore \n5.20 Gran Paradiso \n\nSouthwell \n  \n2.30 Gorgeous General \n3.05 Harbour Quay (nb) \n3.35 National Glory \n4.10 Weld Al Emarat (nap) \n4.40 Stay Forever \n5.10 Lexikon \nKempton Park \n  \n4.55 Joey Boy \n5.30 Magicinthemaking \n6.00 Daring Guest \n6.30 Verdana Blue \n7.00 Intrepidly \n7.30 Cold Harbour \n8.00 Reignite \n8.30 Rivas Rob Roy",

        "content": "From Virginia Woolf to Tove Jansson, author Charlotte Runcie chooses books telling maritime stories too rarely told\nThe sea, historically, has mostly been a man\u2019s world. Whether the people navigating it were sailors, pirates, explorers, whalers or fishermen bringing home the catch, the women in their families were usually left behind \u2013 but, of course, those women\u2019s lives were shaped by the sea, too.\nWhen I started writing my book about the sea, Salt on Your Tongue, it was around the time that I was pregnant with my first child. I\u2019ve always felt drawn to the coast, but now it was the women of the sea who fascinated me most. Sea-women in novels, folklore and songs are often seductive, strong and even supernatural. In the Odyssey and Beowulf, women of the sea can be witches and goddesses, Sirens and mermaids luring men to their doom or spiritual protectors controlling the winds and seeing sailors safely to harbour. Salt on Your Tongue weaves together the spellbinding stories I found of the sea and its power over us across centuries, and particularly of women connected with water, mingled with my own experience of pregnancy and birth.\nIn later centuries, more women have told their own stories of the sea, and these have their own compelling power, showing that women and the sea are linked in all sorts of ways in our cultural memory. These are the books I want to thrust into the hands of kindred spirits who love being by the sea, eating fish and chips on shingly beaches and feeling invigorated by the smell of salt and seaweed. They explore hard work, mysticism, identity and a visceral connection to the natural world. Here are 10 favourites:\n1. Female Tars: Women Aboard Ship in the Age of Sail by Suzanne StarkStark revealed the previously untold stories of female sea-goers from the 17th to the 19th centuries, women who were \u201cofficially ignored and often hidden\u201d. Female Tars was a rare study of women at the sea when it was published in 1996, and has since become a crucial historical text, encompassing accounts of navy wives, prostitutes, deck hands, nurses, servants, and women who dressed as men in order to become sailors. I love Stark\u2019s passionate writing, full of fascinating stories of a secret underclass.\n2. The Waves by Virginia WoolfI don\u2019t need to introduce Woolf\u2019s classic experimental novel to you, but no list of books about women and the sea would be complete without it. It\u2019s a work of interconnecting lives and ways of seeing the world, all flowing into one another. The way it\u2019s written reflects the sea itself, with waves of narrative rushing in on top of one another, forever in flux. It\u2019s the essential modern example of a woman writing about the sea and about people.\n3. The Water Cure by Sophie MackintoshMackintosh\u2019s 2018 debut novel was longlisted for the Booker prize, and deservedly so. It\u2019s a chilling and precise story about three sisters whose lives are defined by control, and their position on an island surrounded by sea. But that all changes when three men wash up on the shore. It left me as shivery as if I\u2019d just been for a January swim.\n4. The Summer Book by Tove JanssonThis novel by the visionary writer and artist \u2013 the genius behind the Moomins \u2013 is captivating. Through gently ebbing and flowing narrative, Jansson creates an intimate island world for the little girl Sophia and her grandmother in the Gulf of Finland, their relationship framed by the sea. It\u2019s about female family relationships, age and childishness, wisdom and whimsy, in fresh sea air.\n5. The Outrun by Amy LiptrotLiptrot\u2019s Wainwright prize-winning memoir of overcoming addiction while swimming in the seas around her home in Orkney is sharp, tender and beautiful; a remarkable, clear-eyed study of nature, wildness and hope.\n6. Petticoat Whalers: Whaling Wives at Sea by Joan DruettSome of the few women who spent significant time at sea in the 19th century were the wives of captains on whaling ships. Druett\u2019s historical study brings together diary entries from women of the time and ships\u2019 logs written by men who often didn\u2019t quite know what to do with the women on board. It is packed with extraordinary stories of women struggling with harsh conditions, living as the only female presence on a ship full of rowdy men, and sometimes giving birth miles away from land.\n7. Sea Journal by Lisa WoollettThe British coastline encapsulated in a treasure trove of a book. Writer and photographer Woollett brings together her thoughtful diaries from walking on beaches across a full calendar year, in all weathers, with photographs of the waves and of the treasures that she has found on the way, which range from shells and cuttlebones to ammonite fossils and mermaid\u2019s purses.\n8. The Gracekeepers by Kirsty LoganThis novel is set in the near future, when sea levels have risen and engulfed most of the land. On a circus boat travelling the waves giving glitter-soaked performances, a young female performer and her captive bear have a secret. They meet another young woman who lives alone in the middle of the ocean, tending the watery graves of those who have died at sea. Logan is a gifted modern fairytale teller and the women in The Gracekeepers find in the sea freedom and captivity, consolation and desolation.\n9. The Salt Path by Raynor WinnRaynor Winn is a master of writing about nature and grief. The coast is the backbone of her memoir about walking the 630-mile South West Coast Path from Somerset to Dorset in the wake of learning that her husband of 32 years was terminally ill, and that they had lost their home. It\u2019s a gripping story about a search for home, resilience and emotion, all the while in conversation with the sea.\n10. Katie Morag\u2019s Island Stories by Mairi HedderwickThese are the stories, I think, that first showed me the sea as a romantic place. As a child I was mesmerised by the stories of Katie Morag\u2019s idyllic childhood on the fictional Hebridean Isle of Struay. Here, daily life is structured around the tides and the ferry timetable, and Katie\u2019s adventures take place on wild beaches, windswept cliffs and among a strong community.\n\n Salt on Your Tongue: Women and the Sea by Charlotte Runcie is published by Canongate, priced \u00a314.99.

        "content": "Lack of support and high teacher turnover rates are also some of the reasons teachers across the country cite as motivation\nLow pay, oversized classrooms, underfunding, old textbooks, a lack of support staff and high teacher turnover rates. These are a few of the reasons teachers across the United States cite as motivations behind a fresh wave of teacher strikes this year, restarting a phenomenon that provided a massive boost to the US labor movement in 2018.\nSo far in 2019 strikes have broken out in Los Angeles and Oakland in California, Denver in Colorado and in Virginia and West Virginia, notching up notable wins in terms of pay raises and better working conditions.\nThe fresh push on strikes has come despite a June 2018 supreme court ruling in the Janus case that held non-union members in the public sector do not have to pay union fees. The decision was seen as a serious blow to unions but teacher unions, at least, have avoided massive membership and funding losses and instead continued a nationwide burst of recruiting, organizing and successful strike actions.\nFor Tania Kappier, a history teacher at Oakland Technical high school and board member of a teachers union in Oakland , the motivations for taking action are simple and at the core of their job.\n\u201cOur work conditions are the students\u2019 education conditions. We\u2019re doing the best we can at an impossible job and that\u2019s not OK for our students and it\u2019s not OK for our own dignity,\u201d Kappier said.\nKappier explained classrooms in Oakland\u2019s school district are too large, her history textbooks are outdated, schools in the district don\u2019t have nurses, adequate staffing of counselors, no librarians, and music and art programs are non-existent at some schools in the district. She also noted teachers in Oakland are not paid enough to make ends meet in a district where rental costs have soared 51.1% between 2012 to 2017.\nThe issues facing public schools in Oakland are similar to other school districts across America where teachers led a 30-year high in strikes in 2018. A common theme of these walkouts is drastic declines in public schools funding, where many states have not replenished cuts made to public education during the 2008 economic recession.\n\u201cAfter the last recession, nearly every state cut their school funding, in many cases cut very deeply,\u201d said Michael Leachman, senior director of State Fiscal Research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nLeachman co-authored a November 2017 report that found 29 states were funding less per student in 2015 than they were in 2008. States with high declines in state funding have been sites for some of the largest teacher strikes.\n\u201cAs the economy gradually improved coming out of the recession, some states made the challenge more difficult by deeply cutting income taxes which is the primary revenue source for states,\u201d said Leachman. \u201cThey essentially locked in their recession-era cuts for school funding.\u201d\nIn all, statewide teacher strikes occurred during 2018 and 2019 in West Virginia, California, Colorado, Virginia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Kentucky and North Carolina. Many of these states are leaders in the teacher pay gap, the percentage gap by which public school teachers are paid less than comparable workers. This gap hit a record high in 2017 at 18.7%.\n\u201cSystemic defunding of public schools, amid tax cuts for the wealthiest and profiteering efforts, has left teachers to lead the fight for one of our highest ideals, the promise to educate each and every kid regardless of means,\u201d said Dr Sylvia Allegretto, co-chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at UC Berkeley.\nThe wave of action began in February, 2018, when around 20,000 teachers in West Virginia shut down schools in every county in the state for nine consecutive days before the governor signed a bill giving teachers and other school staff a 5% raise to end the strike.\nLast week, teachers in West Virginia went out on strike again for two days to protest against a bill being pushed in the state senate that would tie teacher pay raises to funding for charter schools.\n\u201cThe issue last year was mainly over benefits. The issue this year is the Republican state senate proposed this bill that was really vindictive toward teachers and had things in it that would hurt students,\u201d said Jacob Fertig, an art teacher at Riverside high school in Belle, West Virginia.\nHe noted pay and benefits for teachers have been in decline throughout the state, and students are facing difficult living situations due to the opioid epidemic plaguing West Virginia.\n\u201cAt the school I\u2019m at, the students are lucky enough to have one parent. A lot of kids live with boyfriends, girlfriends, sisters, brothers, or whoever can take them in because parents are addicted to drugs,\u201d Fertig said. \u201cThat translates to a classroom where kids don\u2019t have a lot of prospects, they don\u2019t have a lot of hope and it\u2019s very difficult in terms of teaching them because a lot of their basic needs are not met.\u201d\nAround 31,000 teachers in Los Angeles started off 2019\u2019s strike wave in the nation\u2019s second largest school district, walking out for seven days before settling on an agreement that included a pay raise, increase of support staff, and a plan to reduce class sizes to mandated caps.\n\u201cThe takeaway from these teacher strikes are politicians and administrators who think the teacher unions are weak, vulnerable and can be broken have been proven wrong,\u201d said Larry Strauss, a high school English teacher in Los Angeles.\n\u201cWhatever they offer after a few days after a strike, they could\u2019ve offered before a strike,\u201d added Strauss. \u201cThey could have offered that before they lost millions of dollars during a strike. So the only reason to allow a strike is to test the strength of the union. That\u2019s clearly what they\u2019re doing, and teacher unions so far have stood up to the test.\u201d",

        "content": "From soviet five-year plans to the New Deal in the US and China\u2019s Great Leap Forward to post-war building in Europe, concrete has been the material of choice for revolutionary change\n\u201cThis process,\u201d wrote Fran\u00e7ois Coignet in 1861 of his new product, \u201cwill transform the safety, well-being, health and morality of mankind.\u201d He predicted it would inspire nothing less than a \u201crevolution\u201d \u2013 not a word to be used lightly with the events of 1848 still fresh in the French memory.\nCoignet\u2019s new product was concrete, and he wasn\u2019t far wrong in his predictions \u2013 except maybe for the bit about morality. Coignet was a Saint-Simonian socialist, which is to say that, unlike Marx, he thought social equality could be achieved without class war. He believed that concrete would be a step towards a world in which working people would own the means of production. Wherever the raw materials for concrete \u2013 sand and limestone \u2013 were available, which is to say just about everywhere, people of no skill would be empowered to build clean, dry, comfortable dwellings and be able to live in dignity. No more peasants\u2019 hovels.\nSince Coignet\u2019s time, concrete has often been referred to as revolutionary, but this revolution has taken on three very different guises.\nThe first has been the one envisaged by Coignet, through which a superior means of construction has been brought within reach of the world\u2019s poor. The greater part of the world\u2019s cement production is used by people with no professional or technical training: self-builders and small-scale constructors. The results may not look much, but if we are to measure the social effects of concrete, the greatest have been in the advances brought to ordinary people through informal construction.\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nBy and large this achievement is not acknowledged by the cement and concrete industries, for whom association with the messy world of small builders in the slums and shantytowns of Africa or India is neither advantageous nor desirable \u2013 not good for their image.\nArchitects and engineers visiting favelas such as Rocinha, left, in Rio de Janeiro have been astonished by the economy and ingenuity of the concrete structures. Photograph: Mauro Pimentel/Mauro Pimentel\nYet it is estimated that were all the earth floors of dwellings worldwide to be replaced by concrete, the incidence of parasitic diseases would drop by 80%. Nor are self-builds always lacking in skill: architects and engineers visiting favelas in Brazil have been astonished by the economy and ingenuity of the concrete structures. Everywhere, for those living in poverty, concrete has meant a step up in the world \u2013 and because of concrete\u2019s reputation as an \u201cadvanced\u201d or \u201cmodern\u201d material, it puts them on a par with the wealthier inhabitants of the planet. Concrete changes not just people\u2019s material existence. It changes their global self-image.\nThe second revolution of concrete has been to transform building with a new structural technique. It has allowed constructions that could only be imagined before the 20th century: dams, bridges, tunnels of a scale never before possible. These are the sorts of achievements that the cement and concrete industry does like to celebrate \u2013 and there is no question that these structures have transformed people\u2019s lives, too, by overcoming nature, speeding up communications and bringing us closer together. In architectural terms, concrete introduced new principles into design and made possible works such as the sailing shells of the Sydney Opera House or the cantilevered saucer of Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s Museu de Arte Contemporanea at Niter\u00f3i in Brazil \u2013 works often described as revolutionary on account of forms that would previously have been unachievable.\nConcrete transformed infrastructure projects in the 20th century, allowing building on a scale never previously seen, from the Hoover dam (top) Boulder dam as well as road projects such as the Chiswick flyover (bottom left). Photographs: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG/Getty\nBut of all the features of concrete that might be considered revolutionary, what has perhaps been the most important has been its use to bring about rapid change. When sudden or urgent transformations were called for, whether it was five-year plans in the Soviet Union, the New Deal in the USA, the Great Leap Forward in China, or post-second world war housebuilding in Europe, concrete was pressed into service.\nEach of these political programmes anticipated infrastructural work on a wholly new scale, beyond existing industrial and labour resources. Concrete, because its raw materials were easy to find and relatively cheap and because, in theory, much of the work could be done with unskilled labour, promised to make possible the otherwise impossible. When in 1956 the Soviet Union set a seven-year target to \u201ccatch up and overtake the USA\u201d, concrete construction was a vital component. Two years earlier, Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s first major speech after the death of Stalin had been on the advantages of concrete.\nIt lasted three hours. No head of state before or since has delivered such a lengthy or detailed speech about concrete, nor made concrete the subject of such a politically explosive address: Khrushchev used it to announce his break with Stalinism. He did so by criticising the inefficiencies of the craft methods of construction favoured by Uncle Joe, and arguing instead for the benefits of prefabricated concrete construction that would draw upon Russia\u2019s vast resources of unskilled labour.\nKnown as Khrushchevka, this type of five-storey apartment building is made of prefabricated concrete panels, and was developed in the 1950s when Nikita Khrushchev was in power in the USSR. Photograph: Andrei Makhonin/Tass\nKhrushchev\u2019s speech astonished his audience \u2013 it is still a gripping read today \u2013 and made concrete central to the future of the Soviet Union. Within a year, he had pushed through a decree that all future construction would follow a standard design: \u201ca single type of building for the whole country\u201d, all in precast concrete. You can see the consequences throughout the former Soviet empire.\nIn Britain in the same decade, faced with the urgent need to build more houses, Harold Watkinson, the minister responsible for the motorway programme, remarked in a statement that was more than just a metaphor: \u201cSomehow we had to make a lot of bricks without straw \u2013 and quickly.\u201d\nThe answer, again, was concrete, and prefabricated construction systems that shifted construction into factories, where, it was supposed, productivity would be higher than on building sites. Although concrete was rarely cheaper, it promised to be faster \u2013 and by creating an entirely new look to the built environment, it would signal to the public that a new transformation was indeed afoot.\nThree of the different models of prefabricated housing used in Britain to deal with housing shortages following the second world war. Photographs: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty/Keystone Features/Evening Standard\nThe deliberate linking of concrete to these sudden and dramatic transformations of the 20th century has associated concrete with the politics of the left, rather than of the right. Although the fascist regimes of the 1930s played the same card \u2013 social renovation through new infrastructures \u2013 and indeed had sometimes used concrete to do so, as with the autobahns in Germany, the dominant association of concrete was with socialism.\nInsofar as leftwing politics were about radical change and rightwing politics about the preservation of tradition, concrete was more readily aligned with the left, and the Soviet Union particularly cemented this idea in the popular imagination. As late as the 1990s, Virginia Bottomley, the UK\u2019s Conservative secretary of state for national heritage, when asked to approve the listing of the Alexander Fleming House complex at London\u2019s Elephant and Castle that had once housed the Ministry of Health, allegedly responded: \u201cOh no, we can\u2019t list that \u2026 it\u2019s concrete \u2026 it\u2019s communist.\u201d\nConcrete is no longer what it was. In the west, at least, it has lost its transformative aura. There are many reasons for this, and its contamination by state socialism is one. Another is the unforeseen consequence of what Coignet saw as its greatest asset: the democratisation of construction. Concrete has been stigmatised as \u201ccheap\u201d, the stuff of the world\u2019s poor. But anyone who doubts its lasting revolutionary potential has only to look at China, which poured more concrete from 2012 to 2015 than the US did in the entire 20th century. Socialist or capitalist, in China the most rapid transformation of a country ever to have taken place in human history has been achieved in a couple of decades, in no small part by means of concrete.\nAdrian Forty is emeritus professor of architectural history at the Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London and the author of books including Objects of Desire and Concrete and Culture\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

        "content": "Prime minister pleads with parliament to \u2018do its duty\u2019 and back Brexit deal\nTheresa May has insisted it is still possible for the UK to leave the European Union on 29 March if enough MPs back a revised withdrawal deal, amid signs hardline Eurosceptics may be softening their demands.\nIn an article in the Daily Mail, the prime minister pleaded with MPs to get behind her deal, after she was forced to give them votes on extending article 50 and ruling out no deal if her withdrawal agreement does not pass.\n\u201cOur absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March 29,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDoing so would give businesses and citizens the certainty they deserve.\n\u201cBy committing Labour to holding a second referendum, despite promising to implement Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn has shown once again that he cannot be trusted to keep his promises. His cynical political games would take us back to square one.\n\u201cInstead, parliament should do its duty so that our country can move forward.\u201d\nMay is hoping to win round more hardline Eurosceptics to back her deal, playing on their fears that a delay to Brexit could mean a second referendum.\nHowever, she needs a revised agreement from Brussels in the coming days on changes to the Irish backstop to prevent the UK being locked into a permanent customs union.\nThe European Research Group of MPs, pushing for a hard Brexit, had been clear that the backstop must be removed.\nBut their leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, appeared to temper this demand in an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday.\nHe said: \u201cI can live with the de facto removal of the backstop, even if it isn\u2019t de jure. What do I mean by that? I mean that if there is a clear date that says the backstop ends, and that that is in the text of the treaty, or equivalent to the text of the treaty - if it were to be an appendix to the treaty; bear in mind, the Irish backstop is in itself an appendix to the treaty. So if you had a further appendix that said, \u2018This will not go beyond a particular date\u2019, and a short date, not a long date, then that would remove the backstop in the lifetime of parliament. That would have a reasonable effect from my point of view ...\n\u201cA changed deal is a changed deal. Of course, I would be open to considering that.\u201d\nAfter a meeting of the ERG on Tuesday, Rees-Mogg also acknowledged there was unlikely to be the parliamentary numbers to leave with no deal. \u201cThere is no enthusiasm for backing the deal as it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Irish backstop could be removed or fundamentally altered, then that would be a different kettle of fish.\u201d\nIn her statement to the Commons on Tuesday, May said she planned to hold the next meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March. If it was defeated again, it would be followed by a vote on 13 March on leaving with no deal and, if this was rejected, a vote on 14 March for an extension to article 50.\nSome Eurosceptic Tory MPs are particularly worried about an extension as they fear this could end with May reaching out to Labour to work on a softer Brexit deal they could vote for, a second referendum or general election resulting in a Labour victory.\nIn a stormy cabinet meeting on Tuesday at which May announced her plan, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, both said any extension of the Brexit talks must be usedto find a new coalition in parliament.\nThe comments strongly suggest an extension is most likely to result in the softening of May\u2019s proposed deal in order to bring Labour MPs onboard \u2013 an outcome hardline Tory Eurosceptics would want to avoid.\nAt the cabinet meeting, Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, was among those most angered by the decision to offer a vote on an extension and suggested some ministers had undermined the prime minister. The Treasury secretary, Liz Truss, called the trio \u201ckamikaze\u201d ministers, according to several sources.\nRudd, along with the justice secretary, David Gauke, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, warned the prime minister in private last week that she must rule out a no-deal Brexit or risk dozens of ministerial resignations.\nClark, Rudd and Gauke then wrote in the Daily Mail that Brexit should be delayed if a deal was not passed by mid-March. While Hammond did not sign up to the public statements from his ministerial colleagues threatening to defy Tory whips and back the Cooper-Letwin amendment, allies insisted the chancellor \u201cdoes his lobbying inside the tent\u201d.\nEven the party\u2019s chair and May loyalist, Brandon Lewis, said ministers should be cautious about the framing of no deal, pointing out the option was supported by many Tory members. Rudd told Lewis, however, that the cabinet \u201cneeded to be straight with the British people\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a bitter pill to swallow,\u201d one cabinet source said. \u201cBut ultimately we felt like we had been left with no other option. There has been a private back-and-forth. Should we just let people resign? But that causes its own party problems, too.\u201d\nThe promise to vote on a Brexit delay is likely to avert a serious ministerial rebellion. Dozens had been privately threatening to back an amendment on Wednesday to the government\u2019s latest Brexit motion, which would have paved the way for legislation to extend article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline.\nThe amendment had been tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper and the Tories Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, but the latter said he believed their concerns had been appeased by May\u2019s pledge to hold the three votes in mid-March.\nThe cross-party coalition led by Cooper still tabled three amendments to the government\u2019s motion, but was likely to push only one of them to a vote. It sets out the promises made by May on Tuesday in a form that MPs can vote for, giving them added reassurance that neither the prime minister nor other cabinet ministers will go back on those promises.\nCooper said the amendment would \u201cpin down and confirm the commitment made by the prime minister\u201d to hold the series of votes.\nThe coalition was awaiting further reassurances from ministers on Wednesday, including from Barclay. If it sensed any backsliding, it could still push for a vote on the two other amendments.",

        "content": "European cats to be released into Highlands in \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 to help save species \nConservationists are planning to release captive European wildcats into the Highlands in a final attempt to save the Scottish wildcat from extinction.\nThe new measures, described by ecologists as a last-ditch effort to save the species, follow an expert report that confirmed the Scottish wildcat was on the verge of becoming genetically extinct, with as few as 30 left in isolated pockets of the Highlands.\n\u201cBased on the available information, we consider the wildcat population in Scotland to be no longer viable,\u201d the report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), released on Wednesday, stated.\n\u201cThe number of wildcats is too small, the hybridisation too far advanced and the population too fragmented. We therefore conclude that it is too late to conserve the wildcat in Scotland as a standalone population.\u201d\nConservation sources said the Scottish government had supported work on a captive breeding and release programme from a new wildcat conservation centre being built at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland\u2019s (RZSS) wildlife park near Kingussie in the Cairngorms.\nEcologists believe they will need to import wildcats trapped on the continent, perhaps as early as next year, and add them to the captive population to help strengthen the gene pool. There are 94 Scottish pure wildcats in captivity and European wildcats will need time to acclimatise to Scotland\u2019s wetter and colder climate.\nIn about five years, they would be released into an area such as the Cairngorms, but only after a ruthless programme of neutering and culling of feral domestic cats, and further controls on domestic pets in the area, to protect them from crossbreeding.\nRoseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said: \u201cThe wildcat is an iconic Scottish species and, as such, I will consider every possible action the Scottish government can take to save it, including an increased focus on captive breeding and reinforcement of the Scottish population with wildcats from elsewhere.\u201d\nThe IUCN reports says recent genetic testing and population sampling by the RZSS and conservation agencies has confirmed the majority of Scottish wildcats are now interbred with feral domestic cats.\nBecause the species is so elusive and rare, ecologists are not certain how many survive but estimate the wild population ranges from about 30 to 430 individuals. Sampling between 2015 and 2018 found only 20% were pure wildcats, while 80% were either hybrids or actually entirely domestic.\nAn RZSS genetics study published last year found, however, that the extent and rate of crossbreeding was so advanced that domestic cat genes were now dominant in the surviving wild population.\nThe IUCN, which has very strict rules on reintroducing wild species in areas where humans endanger native populations, said any release programme would have to be tightly managed.\n\u201cWe reason that the recovery of the wildcat in Scotland will only be possible with the support of reintroduction/reinforcement projects, and that the remaining \u2018pure Scottish wildcats\u2019 should be combined with wildcats from continental Europe,\u201d its report said.\n\u201cBoth reintroduction projects or reinforcement of remnant nuclei should be considered. This requires a rigorous suppression of feral cats and hybrids in areas of reinforcements, and the removal of feral cats in areas of potential reintroduction.\u201d\nArriving after the last ice age, wildcats were once widespread across northern parts of the UK mainland and Wales. After 10,000 years of isolation, they are now genetically distinct from European populations but their numbers have plummeted due to habitat loss, disease, human persecution, interbreeding and road deaths.\nEven so, the IUCN report recommends the Scottish project should keep in contact with proposals, still in their infancy, to reintroduce wildcats to other parts of the UK.\nDr Andrew Kitchener, chairman of the Scottish Wildcat Action steering group, a coalition of more than 20 agencies and charities, said: \u201cWe now have the strongest and most reliable evidence to date that wildcats are in a more endangered state than previously understood.\n\u201cWhile we believe there are wildcats remaining in the wild in Scotland, there are no longer enough to ensure their continued survival as viable populations. We can now plan the essential next steps to give the wildcat a sustainable future.\u201d\nEileen Stuart, head of policy with Scottish Natural Heritage, a government conservation agency, said efforts to ensure the survival of the species must involve help from the wider public.\n\u201cA key part of this will be a national conversation on domestic pet and feral cat populations and how we manage these,\u201d she said. \u201cThe public will have an important role in helping minimise future hybridisation. Responsible cat ownership \u2013 including microchipping, neutering and vaccinations \u2013 is one way we can help reduce the devastating effects on wildcats.\u201d",

        "content": "As their stunning Sgt Pepper dance show tours the UK, Mark Morris and Ethan Iverson recall how they fell for the album\u2019s \u2018hokey, vaudeville\u2019 charms\nThe light-footed Fred Astaire is among the faces on the cover and one song finds a certain Henry the Horse doing the waltz. But it\u2019s still a leap to imagine a concept dance show based on Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Yet here is Minga Prather posing on stage as Astaire, while other dancers represent cover stars Sonny Liston, Shirley Temple and Albert Einstein. In the pit, they\u2019re introduced in a quasi-Gregorian chant by baritone Clinton Curtis, part of a chamber ensemble featuring theremin and soprano sax. Soon the dancers skip through featherlight steps for With a Little Help from My Friends. Behind them a glittering foil set suggests both a mountain range and crashing waves. This, you may have guessed, is not your average Beatles tribute night.\nPepperland, which premiered at Liverpool\u2019s Sgt Pepper at 50 festival in 2017, is a collaboration between choreographer Mark Morris and composer Ethan Iverson \u2013 and one of many productions to have been inspired by the Fab Four. When I meet the pair, on the eve of the show\u2019s UK and Ireland tour, I ask if they ever saw the 1978 Sgt Pepper film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton as the one and only Mr Billy Shears. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s the worst thing in the world,\u201d says Morris with mock horror. How about Julie Taymor\u2019s Beatles fantasia Across the Universe? \u201cIt. Is. A. Nightmare,\u201d he declares, drawing out the last word. Then, of course, there\u2019s the hit Vegas show Love, created \u2013 Morris grimaces \u2013 by \u201cCirque du fucking Soleil\u201d.\nIverson says there\u2019s \u201cnothing worse\u201d than a Beatles cover project. When he was in the innovative jazz trio The Bad Plus, that idea was occasionally mooted and the band would groan. But unlike the standard Beatles tributes, Pepperland is a step away from nostalgia \u2013 it\u2019s not a case, Iverson says, of \u201cwe love this record, now we\u2019re going to dance to it\u201d.\nThe original proposition, for the Liverpool festival, was that a variety of artists would each create a work inspired by a different track. Judy Chicago made a huge mural for Fixing a Hole while Meow Meow turned Lovely Rita into a procession down Hope Street. \u201cI thought I was supposed to do the whole album,\u201d laughs Morris. \u201cMy mistake!\u201d\nMorris and Iverson selected a handful of Sgt Pepper songs plus Penny Lane, which was originally intended for the album. Iverson then came up with some bracing arrangements, adding new compositions responding to the album\u2019s \u201cundercurrent of classical music\u201d. The album tracks may be familiar but Iverson\u2019s versions are disarming, not least When I\u2019m Sixty Four, which is performed by a disintegrating line of dancers, as its metre changes from four to six to five. It spelt havoc for the audience trying to clap along at the Liverpool premiere.\nThe first piece Iverson wrote was a \u201c12-bar, straight-up blues\u201d because \u201cthe first thing you hear on the record is a guitar blues riff\u201d. The show opens with a chord that reflects the one heard at the end of the album. Pepperland both starts and finishes with its dancers forming a communal nucleus; it repeatedly explores the notion of an individual isolated from and returning to a core group. The choreography pursues a line from Within You Without You \u2013 \u201cWe were talking, about the space between us all\u201d \u2013 as well as the album\u2019s inclusive spirit and its motif of rock-star seclusion.\nOne day during rehearsals, the company members lay down in the studio and listened to the album together. The LP is \u201cpart of our consciousness,\u201d says Iverson, \u201ca shared language of the human experience. Everyone knows Sgt Pepper\u2019s.\u201d Morris laughs: \u201cWhether you want to or not!\u201d The show, he says, is for both fans and haters of the album.\nDo they remember when they first heard it? \u201cI was an adorable child,\u201d begins Morris with a grin. \u201cBeatlemania was in full swing in the United States. My sisters and all of their friends screamed at the radio at the Beatles. And I thought they were sexy in my nascent queerness.\u201d He saw one of their last American gigs, the year before Sgt Pepper\u2019s release. \u201cI went to the concert and it was only screaming. There wasn\u2019t one note of audible music.\u201d (Pepperland includes a nod to Beatlemania, with the Fab Four chased off stage in an early scene.) As a boy, Morris loved the \u201chokiness of all the vaudeville stuff\u201d on the album, and the song Within You Without You was his first introduction to Indian instruments, now one of his passions.\nIverson had the LP in high school. \u201cI didn\u2019t listen to a lot of rock,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was already a jazz person. But there was something about this album that was clearly attractive. Everything lands the right way.\u201d\nIverson says the 60s \u201cBritish invasion\u201d bands had an impact that \u201cevery musician on the planet\u201d had to deal with. \u201cEven the drummers were great! We [America] owned drumming for 60 years. We just knew there weren\u2019t any good drummers anywhere else. Then suddenly there were these great drummers coming from England.\u201d He became intrigued again by the band when he read that, in the 60s, many jazz musicians struggled to play the Beatles because of the phrase lengths. \u201cThe song Yesterday is seven bars. They played eight-bar phrases for a century. How do you play seven bars? In terms of basic songwriting I started to become a little more intrigued by the Beatles and a little more forgiving of their great success and the footprint they left on the planet.\u201d\nWhen I talk to Aaron Loux, who has danced in Pepperland and is the rehearsal assistant, he recalls listening to Rubber Soul repeatedly on family car journeys and, as a child, performing a dance to Octopus\u2019s Garden, cartwheeling in a yellow starfish costume. \u201cWe had Sgt Pepper in our record collection. I put it on once and it was too weird for me.\u201d Pepperland has reintroduced to him the different textures of the album: \u201cI fell in love with it and got to see it deconstructed in the process.\u201d\nAt times in Pepperland, the choreography represents a song\u2019s narrative directly, with dancers acting out the lyrics in lieu of a singer. For one number, the ethereal theremin is used as a lead voice. Morris\u2019s steps and Iverson\u2019s notes can feel trippy, as does Johan Henckens\u2019 far-out, crumpled foil set (Morris wanted something sparkly like the pillows in Merce Cunningham\u2019s RainForest from 1968). But Elizabeth Kurtzman\u2019s costumes \u2013 yellow slacks, pink socks, orange polo necks \u2013 have the clean, elegant lines of the mod movement. On a stage bursting with colour, the dancers\u2019 sunglasses become kaleidoscope eyes. \u201cI wanted it to be mod not hippy,\u201d says Morris. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the destruction of society. It wasn\u2019t the Vietnam war we were doing, it was the fabulous, tailored outlines of early Carnaby Street, when there was still a naughty element to the mods.\u201d\nLike the album, Pepperland is layered, complex and consistently witty, even amid scenes of tender poignancy. Morris\u2019s shows can take around two years to create but this one came together in a hurry. \u201cWe had a short window to make it \u2013 about three months,\u201d explains Loux. \u201cEthan was making the music as we were going.\u201d Morris showed the company footage of popular dances from the era \u2013 the jerk, mashed potato, frug and boogaloo \u2013 as well as earlier social dances such as the Charleston. Loux says that while Morris\u2019s choreography can be very challenging, \u201cthe showmanship of \u2018look how hard this is\u2019 doesn\u2019t really interest him\u201d. The key for the dancers is to \u201cdo what he\u2019s asking you in a way that still looks and feels natural so the audience think they could do it right there with you\u201d.\nAccording to Morris, they were working on the show right until the minute before its premiere at Liverpool\u2019s Royal Court, which \u201chad a little bit of a beer smell to it, like Liverpool herself\u201d. Loux says there were nerves about presenting a Beatles piece to a home crowd but they remember a warm and wild reception. All the same, Morris still tells audiences: \u201cIf you\u2019re here for a Beatles singalong, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d And save the clapping for the end.\nPepperland is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 20\u201323 March. Then touring until 1 May.",

        "content": "Prime minister\u2019s offer of votes on rejecting no deal and extending article 50 gets frosty reception\nThe European media are far from reassured by Theresa May\u2019s latest pledge that MPs would have a chance next month both to reject a no-deal Brexit and extend article 50, with many pointing out it had done nothing to avert the risk of Britain crashing out.\n\u201cEurophile MPs in parliament may have finally taken the upper hand,\u201d wrote Lib\u00e9ration in France. \u201cTheresa May finally ceded to them what they had been demanding for months \u2013 votes on a no deal, and a delay of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\u201cBut once again, the prime minister has neither resolved nor ruled out anything \u2013 certainly not the possibility that at the end of the day, parliament fails to agree on a deal at all. By the end of her speech, barely 30 MPs were present in the chamber to listen. Could it be that what she says is no longer very important?\u201d\nLe Monde said that, despite the prime minister\u2019s about turn on an extension, \u201cBrexit uncertainty remains at its peak \u2026 It is hard to see how, if a deal that has taken two years to negotiate is rejected for a second time on 12 March, an extra three months will somehow allow the exit door to be found.\u201d\nThe timetable for May\u2019s strategy of running down the clock was now \u201cextremely tight\u201d, the paper said, and \u201cin no way excludes the hypothesis of the no-deal Brexit that a majority of MPs fear \u2013 but that the Eurosceptic minority, who have made the prime minister their willing hostage, so strongly desire.\u201d\nIn the Netherlands, de Volkskrant said the danger of the UK leaving the EU on 29 March without an agreement had, on balance, probably decreased. But it noted that the prime minister\u2019s pledges had been made solely to ward off the threat of dozens of frontbench resignations.\nWould the tactic work? \u201cThe lower house will now vote on May\u2019s deal, no deal and an extension on 12, 13 and 14 March respectively,\u201d the paper said, adding ominously: \u201cThe following day is the ides of March \u2013 the day on which Romans settled their debts. And the day Julius Caesar was murdered.\u201d\nIn Spain, El Pa\u00eds said it had been a question of \u201cchoosing the lesser of two evils, and Theresa May has decided to renounce her chief negotiating weapon in Brussels in order to avoid a crisis that would have done away with whatever remains of her authority\u201d.\nThe prime minister was \u201ca master of the art of defending both one thing and its opposite\u201d, the paper said, and was again trying to buy time. ABC\u2019s Enrique Serbieto said differences in the UK parliament were \u201cso deep that nothing guarantees a deal that hasn\u2019t attracted agreement so far will manage to secure it within a few weeks.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s Die Zeit said British politics were \u201csuddenly moving again\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn had given way on a second referendum, it said, while May had promised parliament votes on a no deal and a \u201cshort, temporary\u201d delay to Brexit.\n\u201cWith all these concessions, key players are pulling back from their hitherto fixed positions,\u201d the paper said. \u201cSo has reason returned? No. It\u2019s scarier than that.\u201d May\u2019s offer of a vote on an extension to article 50 was purely tactical, it reckoned.\n\u201cThis is just window dressing. She is ready to agree only to a short-term extension of article 50 \u2013 which the government would have had to ask for anyway in order to ensure there is time to ratify the deal. It is not necessarily a change of policy.\u201d\nThe Estonian daily Postimees focused on the publication of the government\u2019s report on a no-deal Brexit, saying that by the government\u2019s own admission, crashing out without an agreement would lead to \u201can economic disaster that would severely hamper business activity and the quality of life of ordinary people\u201d.\nThe UK \u201cis not ready to leave the European Union on 29 March, such an exit will cost British businesses at least \u00a313bn, and there will be major disruptions to supply chains as well as food shortages\u201d, the paper said.\nSweden\u2019s Aftonbladet observed in an editorial that the new Independent Group of MPs were justified in claiming, in their slogan, that British politics is broken. \u201cWithin the ruling Conservative party, there is no majority for any of the exit options that can be accepted by the EU,\u201d the paper said.\n\u201cIn parliament, there is no support for country crashing out without an agreement. What MPs could perhaps agree on is a kind of soft, Norway-style Brexit \u2013 but that would probably mean the defenestration of Theresa May, so no chance there.\u201d\nThere was, the Swedish paper concluded, \u201cmuch to indicate that there will be no EU exit for the UK at the end of March. But the problem that is Brexit is going to plague British politics for a very long time to come.\u201d",

But in his forthcoming book Time for Lights Out, a \u201chead-on\u201d confrontation with old age and death, he describes himself as nothing more than a \u201clong-haired, artsy-fartsy type\u201d who \u201cdid pictures for kiddy books / Or some such tripe\u201d.\nThe collection of short pieces, which has been in the works for more than a decade, will be published in November by Jonathan Cape, it was announced on Wednesday. Illustrated with Briggs\u2019s pencil drawings, Time for Lights Out starts from the 85-year-old\u2019s school days and his time as an evacuee during the second world war, touching on his memories of his parents and his childhood home.\n\u201cSome [of the pieces are] funny, some melancholy, some remembering his wife, who died young, others about the joy of grandchildren, of walking the dog,\u201d said Jonathan Cape.\nMost of the collection, however, centres on Briggs\u2019s home in Sussex, said the publisher, giving a glimpse of one of the forthcoming collection\u2019s poems:\n\u201cLooking round this house, / What will they say, / The future ghosts?\u201d Briggs writes. \u201cThere must have been / Some barmy old bloke here, / Long-haired, artsy- fartsy type, / Did pictures for kiddy books / Or some such tripe. / You should have seen the stuff / He stuck up in that attic! / Snowman this and snowman that, / Tons and tons of tat.\u201d\nBriggs told the Telegraph in 2007 that Time for Lights Out would \u201cdefinitely be my last\u201d book and was \u201cbound to have a sad ending\u201d. In 2015, he showed the Independent one entry from the book \u2013 a list of illustrators\u2019 names, with the dates of their deaths beside them, and another list noting the health of living illustrators. \u201cI don\u2019t like being taken by surprise by people telling me one of them\u2019s died,\u201d he said.\nDan Franklin, who acquired the book for Jonathan Cape, said that \u201cin some ways, all of Raymond\u2019s books have been about death\u201d.\n\u201cHere he confronts it head-on in a book that is honest and truthful and very touching. Ethel & Ernest [about his parents] was the very first book on the Cape graphic novel list. It\u2019s wonderful to be publishing him again,\u201d said Franklin.",

In the year ending March 2011, there were 48,422 domestic abuse offences recorded by the Metropolitan police, compared with 78,814 up to the same point in 2018.\nThe figures were in published in a report released by the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime. They show that in the past year, three-quarters of victims were female and those who experienced domestic violence were more likely to live in more deprived areas. Earlier this month, it was revealed the number of killings in London linked to domestic abuse trebled from nine to 29 in 2018.\nJoan Smith, the chairwoman of London\u2019s Violence Against Women and Girls board, said: \u201cThe public has yet to realise how widespread sexual violence is.\u201d\nKhan said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the findings. \u201cThe number of people killed by someone they knew in our city is shocking \u2026 Support services in the capital do an amazing job, but the funding situation has left them at breaking point,\u201d he said.\n\u201cVictims, some of the most vulnerable people in our society, are often having to wait a long time for help.\u201d\nFigures show funding for women\u2019s services fell 50% in 2017 as demand rose by 83%. While 15% of all recorded sexual offences take place in the capital, only 6% of government funding comes to London, leaving services at crisis point, according to the report.\nKhan wrote to the home secretary, Sajid Javid, this week, asking the government to play its part and reverse huge cuts to the sector, as well as increase police funding.\nThe report estimates 246,700 adults aged 16 to 59 who live in London have experienced some form of domestic abuse. Women are more likely to have experienced domestic abuse than men (5.9% compared with 2.9%).\nMarai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a black and minority ethnic women\u2019s organisation, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls continues to affect thousands of us across London and we need urgent, widespread change at every level. This can only happen if this becomes a priority for enough of us.\u201d\nSarah Green, a co-director at the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: \u201cWe hope Sadiq\u2019s renewed commitment to ensuring support and protection for abuse survivors, and tackling perpetrators, will make our city one of the best places to grow up as a girl, and live as a woman.\u201d\nLast year, government figures showed domestic violence victims were waiting almost two years on average to receive compensation for abuse. The Ministry of Justice said its most recent statistics show it takes an average of 612 days, or about 20 months, for a payout from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.\nNearly two-thirds of referrals to support services between the end of 2017 and the summer of 2018 were unsuccessful. Rape crisis centres across the capital have been regularly forced to close their waiting lists and, for the first time in the middle of 2018, all four centres shut their lists due to demand.\nSara, a survivor of domestic abuse, said: \u201cDuring the years I struggled with low self-esteem as a result of years of abuse. I was moved around a lot but wasn\u2019t able to find the help I needed. I was eventually placed in a Solace refuge where they supported me to rebuild my life. If only I\u2019d had this support earlier, I might have been able to avoid some of the abuse. Now I can finally see a future, a life ahead of me.\u201d\nThe Home Office has been approached for comment.\n In the UK, the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

More than 100 members of current and former staff are understood to have complaints about Kelvin\u2019s workplace manner.\nThe company appointed the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills in December to investigate the reports of harassment, which it described as \u201cserious\u201d. A spokesman for Ted Baker said the company did not know when the law firm would report back on the findings of its investigation.\nWhen the allegations came to light, the company promised the inquiry would be \u201cthorough and urgent\u201d.

We can\u2019t just shrug and move on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable for VFX artists who have contributed to the success of multimillion-pound features to be the ones to carry risk and go unpaid for their hard work and talent.\u201d\nMore generally, many risks, he said, were shouldered by freelance VFX workers, who were forced to accept long periods of unpaid overtime and antisocial hours, which eroded creativity and productivity. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry that drives talented people out. The gender ratio is particularly male-heavy. Women often can\u2019t stay in an industry that expects almost unlimited unpaid overtime as short notice.\u201d\nBohemian Rhapsody, which has made almost a billion dollars at the global box office, won four awards on Sunday night: best actor for Rami Malek, best editing, best sound editing and best sound mixing.\n This article was amended on 27 February to reflect the fact the Halo VFX were not the only visual effects team working on the film.",

Sharing stories of growth and transition, the cast navigate the constant convulsions between prejudice and acceptance. Monologues are spliced with dance routines and karaoke, with Elijah W Harris\u2019s reckless Teenage Dirtbag a particular highlight.\nDirector Ben Buratta\u2019s show nods to fragility, with Jess Bernberg\u2019s lighting snapping the atmosphere from sensual to scared; the cast soak up light then flinch from it as if under interrogation. While the structure feels a little devised-by-numbers, each performer is exquisite, so traces of predictability are easily forgiven.\nThe show\u2019s comedy seems second nature; there\u2019s a lot of ground and bigotry to cover, but it\u2019s never too heavy. In one brilliant standup scene, Josh-Susan Enright, ready to star in a Hollywood biopic in a glamorous red dress and well-kept moustache, describes a woman who dragged her child away from them. \u201cBitch, what\u2019s your child going to catch? Style?\u201d\nThe show is fuelled by a mixture of generosity and pride, and when the cast dance, you\u2019ll be itching to join in. This is a joy for anyone to experience, but if you have conversations about trans rights around the dinner table that end less than peacefully, book tickets for your family right now.\nAcross the city at the Yard, Sex Sex Men Men (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) tackles the power and problems of masculinity through drag kinging, the act of women and non-binary people dressing up and performing as men. With consent at its heart and a strap-on at its hips, drag collective Pecs\u2019 show is funny, smart and downright sexy.\nQuietly commanding compere and cunning linguist Cesar Jentley (Kit Griffiths) guides us through an array of song, dance and striptease, under the direction of Celine Lowenthal and Temi Wilkey. Several acts could do with a trim but the two standout performances are John Travulva\u2019s (Jodie Mitchell) lecture on patriarchal power structures, given while receiving a blow job, and Thrustin Limbersnake\u2019s (Lauren Steele) food-play scene that\u2019s worth the ticket price alone; the arrival of the baked beans really ups the ante.\nEach scene is taken seriously, no matter how silly. This continues into the more sombre moments, as male vulnerability is embraced through monologues taken verbatim from online forums. They\u2019re performed delicately, with one surprisingly moving confession about pegging.\nAn episode concerning sexual violence is framed well, with the offer for audience members to sit out and be brought back in when it\u2019s over. Though the scene itself lacks the necessary nuance, there is creative use of a watermelon, and a later scene involving cleaning up chunks of the fleshy fruit reminds us of assault\u2019s lingering presence.\nIn some ways it\u2019s heavier than And the Rest of Me Floats, though it too oozes laughter. But the most beautiful moments in both come as the performers slowly take off their costumes. They\u2019re not stripping, just undressing. In Sex Sex Men Men they fold as they go, while in And The Rest of Me Floats the clothes are dropped in a pool of light. Each scene holds all the tenderness and trust required to bare your body to another person. What a feat to achieve that intimacy on stage.\nAnd the Rest of Me Floats is at the Bush theatre, London, and Sex Sex Men Men is at the Yard, London both until 16 March.",

        "content": "The French literary phenomenon focuses on his father\u2019s story, in an exploration of different forms of machismo\nThere is a kind of privilege that consists of being more or less unaffected by politics. This, the French literary phenomenon \u00c9douard Louis writes, \u201cis what separates some populations, whose lives are supported, nurtured, protected, from other populations, who are exposed to death, to persecution, to murder\u201d. Like his previous books The End of Eddy and History of Violence, this short work tackles the intersections of class, gender and sexuality in contemporary France, but instead of relating his own experiences, Louis gives voice to the way the cruel, crude hegemony of masculinity has essentially destroyed his father\u2019s life, making him \u201cas much a victim of the violence\u201d he inflicted as of the violence he endured.\nThe body politic has, as ever, an unrelenting impact on the bodies of the poor. The question of the title, Who Killed My Father?, is not to be taken literally; Louis\u2019s father is disabled but alive, having been injured at the factory where he worked until 2000. He was left barely able to walk, dependent on a machine to help him breathe, which led to obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol and a bad heart, and a ventral hernia, his belly having been \u201ctorn apart by its own weight, its own mass\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re barely fifty years old,\u201d Louis addresses his father. \u201cYou belong to the category of humans whom politics has doomed to an early death\u201d. Through a non-chronological series of memories \u2013 fragments of his childhood concerning his father \u2013 Louis takes aim at the self-defeating masculine ethos of the place where he grew up, which led to the humiliations and abuses suffered in The End of Eddy. It includes a taste for violence, vengeance, the imperative not to do \u201ceffeminate\u201d things like cry or take school seriously, not to take anything seriously that could improve his lot in life: as \u201cfar as I can tell, constructing your masculinity meant depriving yourself of any other life, any other future, any other prospect that school might have opened up. Your manhood condemned you to poverty, to lack of money. Hatred of homosexuality = poverty\u201d.\nBut Louis also shows us a man who, despite being ashamed that his son wants a VHS of Titanic for his eighth birthday, nevertheless loves to sing along to C\u00e9line Dion in the car, who is moved to tears by a live opera broadcast on TV, who loved to dance in his youth, who laughs until he cries at his little son\u2019s impression of an alien, who spends more money than he should buying his eight-year-old not only a copy of Titanic, but a coffee-table book about the film as well. With remarkable delicacy and understanding, Louis conveys the relationship between a father and a son whose love for each other is so fierce and so hard to assimilate to their experience of masculinity that it often can be mistaken for hatred.\nThe careful, deliberate narrative reads as if Louis were testifying, or building a case for a jury in real time. For the crime of condemning his father to his current state Louis points his finger at the leaders of France who \u2013 though Louis doesn\u2019t say it specifically \u2013 exert another, self-important form of machismo, the kind that comes with keeping other men down, by cutting housing benefits and increasing the work week, reducing unemployment assistance. From Jacques Chirac to Emmanuel Macron, Louis blames them for his father\u2019s ills, for the misery that produced him and so many like him, men seen in the newspapers recently, demonstrating in the streets of Paris and other French cities, wearing gilets jaunes.\nIn an episode familiar from The End of Eddy, Louis has a go at exercising masculine power \u2013 making his mother pay for calling him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and a \u201cfaggot\u201d by tattling to his father that she was giving his older brother money on the sly, against his express instructions. But in trying to get revenge on his mother, he ends up nearly killing his father. \u201cI wasn\u2019t innocent,\u201d he writes, admitting his complicity in the cycle of violence. The effect is of a slightly older narrator than in The End of Eddy, one who has become increasingly politicised, who takes a philosophical, sociological view of events. Who Killed My Father reads like a hinge work between Louis\u2019s early autobiographical fiction and the mature writing that is surely to come: perhaps a gilets jaunes Germinal for the 21st century.\n Who Killed My Father by \u00c9douard Louis, translated by Lorin Stein, is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a310.99).

Here\u2019s your step-by-step guide to a faultless dessert\nSticky toffee pudding: the very name is enough to gladden the heart, if not the waistband. This \u2018British classic\u2019, famous around the world thanks to a namecheck in Harry Potter, is actually a relatively recent invention, probably with Canadian origins, popularised by a Lake District hotel in the 1970s. Though unapologetically sweet, it\u2019s surprisingly light \u2013 until you add a big dollop of ice-cream, of course.\nPrep 25 min\n Cook 35 min\n Serves 6\n50g unsalted butter, plus extra to grease175g medjool dates1 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n  75g walnuts (optional)80g golden caster sugar\n  80g dark muscovado sugar\n  1 pinch salt\n  2 cloves\n  175g flour\n  1 tsp baking powder\n  2 eggs\nFor the sauce115g unsalted butter75g golden caster sugar40g dark muscovado sugar140ml double cream\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6) and get the butter out of the fridge to soften, if you haven\u2019t already. Stone and roughly chop the dates \u2013 though sticky, this process should be relatively easy with a small, sharp knife.\nMedjool dates are softer and richer in flavour than some other common varieties, so are the best ones to use for this recipe, if you can find them.\nPut all the ingredients for the sauce in a small pan. Put over a low heat until the butter melts, stirring regularly to encourage it, then mix together, turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Simmer for about four minutes, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nGrease a 24cm x 24cm baking dish with butter. Pour half the sauce into the prepared dish, tip it this way and that until the base is completely coated, then put the dish in the freezer while you make the batter. Leave the rest of the sauce in the pan for now. Boil a kettle of water.\nPut the dates and bicarb in a heatproof bowl and pour over 300ml boiling water to cover. Leave them to soften while you get the rest of the batter ingredients ready.\nIf you\u2019re using the walnuts (pecans would also be nice), heat a small, dry frying pan over a medium-high heat, toast them until fragrant, then tip out on to a board and roughly chop.\nPut the butter and both sugars into a large bowl or food mixer, add a pinch of salt, then beat vigorously until very light and fluffy. Grind the cloves to a fine powder and, in a separate bowl, whisk with the flour and baking powder. Beat the eggs in a cup or jug.\nBeat the eggs, a little at a time, into the butter and sugar mixture, until thoroughly incorporated, then use a large metal spoon to fold in the dry ingredients, being careful to knock as little air out of the mixture as possible. Finally, fold in the dates and their soaking water, plus the walnuts, if using.\nTake the dish out of the freezer and pour the batter on top of the sauce. Tip the dish to level out the batter, then bake for about 30 minutes, until just firm to the touch in the centre.

Donald Trump is probably not the man he had in mind.\nTrump is due at the Metropole on Wednesday evening for his meeting with Kim Jong-un in a second attempt to persuade the North Korean leader to dismantle his nuclear weapons.\nIt is just the latest moment in modern history for which the Metropole has provided an ornate and theatrical backdrop.\nHaving opened as the Grand Hotel Metropole in 1901, at the height of the French empire in Indochina, it quickly became an essential stop on grand tours of east Asia.\nSomerset Maugham wrote some of his 1935 travelogue, The Gentleman in the Parlour, there, and Charlie Chaplin honeymooned at the hotel with his third wife, Paulette Godard, the following year.\nGreene stayed at the Metropole in the last days of French colonial rule. The CIA agent Alden Pyle, the subject of The Quiet American, is a young ideologue trying to manipulate Vietnamese politics to bring about the rise of a \u201cthird force\u201d, neither imperial nor communist. It ends disastrously, presaging the bloody agony of the Vietnam war.\nThe Metropole, renamed the Reunification hotel by Ho Chi Minh\u2019s communist government, survived the blanket bombing of Hanoi, as the US was anxious not to harm Soviet advisers who may have been staying there.\nA bomb shelter under the hotel was rediscovered during repair work in 2011 and is part of the exclusive tour for hotel guests.\nThe hotel hosted the actor Jane Fonda when she made her controversial visit in 1972 during the war, which led her to be labelled \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d on her return to the US.\nNow called the Sofitel Legend Metropole, the hotel has suites named after Maugham, Chaplin and Greene, but not Fonda. The communists are still in charge in Hanoi, but running a resolutely capitalist economy.\nTrump, who sat out the Vietnam war claiming to be suffering from \u201cbone spurs\u201d in his feet, has become a fan of the country, impressed by its economic dynamism and the fact that people came out to cheer him as he arrived on Tuesday night.\n\u201cTremendous crowds, and so much love!\u201d he tweeted after his arrival.\nThe hotel has been festooned with North Korean, US and Vietnamese flags, placed behind a cordoned and requires guests to show their passports to enter. A US press pool has been allowed in, as have eight designated North Korean journalists, all men in suits and lapel pins with pictures of Kim Jong-un and his father, Kim Jong-il.\nKept at a distance in the surrounding streets, Hanoians and camera crews waited for the sound of the sirens of the leaders\u2019 motorcades in the muggy evening.

I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who won the best director Oscar two years running for Birdman and The Revenant, is the first Mexican to chair the panel.\nHis association with the festival began nearly 20 years ago, when his first film, Amores Perros, premiered on the Croisette. Two years ago, he attended with the virtual-reality experience Carne y Arena.\n\u201cCannes is a festival that has been important to me since the beginning of my career,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said in a statement. \u201cI am humbled and thrilled to return this year with the immense honour of presiding over the jury.\u201d\n\u201cCinema runs through the veins of the planet,\u201d he added, \u201cand this festival has been its heart. We on the jury will have the privilege to witness the new and excellent work of fellow film-makers from all over the planet. This is a true delight and a responsibility that we will assume with passion and devotion.\u201d\nPresident of the festival Pierre Lescure and artistic director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux described I\u00f1\u00e1rritu as \u201cnot only a daring film-maker and a director who is full of surprises [but] also a man of conviction, an artist of his time\u201d.\nWhen and where is it?\nThe festival takes place in the French resort town of Cannes in the late spring, normally in mid-May - this year it's 14-25 May.\nWhat are the big films?\nTwenty-one films have been selected to compete for the Palme d'Or, including Once Upon a Time in Hollywood by Quentin Tarantino, A Hidden Life by Terrence Malick, and Ken Loach's Sorry We Missed You. There are also a number of special screenings, including Asif Kapadia's Diego Maradona documentary, Elton John biopic Rocketman, and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal's directorial debut Chicuarotes. There are two parallel festivals, the Directors' Fortnight and Critics' Week, each with their own line-up.\u00a0\nWhat about all the paparazzi?\nCannes isn't just about the art of film. Every night sees a large-scale premiere with a walk up the famous red-carpeted steps outside the giant Lumi\u00e8re cinema. (That's why the festival likes selecting films with big-name Hollywood actors.) Cannes also finds lots of excuses to bring in major stars: for example, 1982's Rambo: First Blood is getting a screening, meaning Sylvester Stallone will pitch up on the Riviera.\nThe 72nd Cannes film festival, which runs 14-25 May, finds itself in need of a boost. There was controversy last year after Fr\u00e9maux declared films from the streaming giant Netflix ineligible for the awards, upon which it withdrew its submissions.\nThese were said to include Roma, which won three Oscars last Sunday night, and the Coen brothers\u2019 The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Both then premiered at August\u2019s Venice film festival instead. Negotiations are said to be ongoing over whether the rules change this year.",

In the accompanying story, prominence was given to the \u201centhusiastic\u201d greeting Kim had been given by the Vietnamese people.\nWhile North Korea has repeatedly signalled it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, the conditions for that to happen may be too high a price to pay for the US and its allies.\n\u201cThe worst case scenario is learning the North Korean definition of denuclearization is untenable with international community\u2019s expectations,\u201d says Jenny Town, the assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cWhen they think of denuclearization, they think it will come about over decades.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also dependent on having good relations with the US, and North Korea has seen the US pull out of many international agreements, so they won\u2019t trust a simple promise, they want to build trust over time.\u201d\nKim is acutely aware of the fate of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up his weapons programmes only to have European and US forces bomb the country during an uprising against him.\nOther possibilities include a meeting relatively light on substance, focused on building goodwill between both sides and positive photo opportunities instead of touching on issues that could cause conflict.\nThere is little chance of a concrete agreement of any kind resulting from the summit. Beginning negotiations with a meeting between the two leaders, before any details have been hammered out, is always risky. The meeting will likely be followed by months, if not years, of negotiations at the lower levels before anything is signed.\nRead a full explainer on the Korea summit here\nThe official KCNA news agency first \u201cbroke\u201d the summit to North Korean citizens at the weekend, reporting ruling party officials\u2019 \u201csincere wishes\u201d for successful negotiations with Trump. On Wednesday, it offered more details about Kim\u2019s itinerary, including his decision to stay in Vietnam until the weekend as part of an \u201cofficial goodwill visit\u201d.\nThe relative detail in which the North Korean media has reported Kim\u2019s visit mirrors Kim\u2019s growing visibility on the international stage over the past year following meetings with Trump, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.\nThe Rodong Sinmun\u2019s coverage of this week\u2019s summit reached fever pitch as Kim completed his long journey by train and limousine from Pyongyang to Hanoi. All of North Korea, the newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, was \u201cboiling like a crucible\u201d in anticipation of the talks. \u201cAll parts of the country are missing him.\u201d\nKCNA said of Kim\u2019s journey: \u201cAlong the hundreds of miles-long route between the border station and the lodging place in Hanoi were numberless Vietnamese people of various strata, who waved the national flags of the two countries and bouquets to warmly welcome Kim Jong-un.\u201d\nThe state broadcaster Korean Central Television, meanwhile, aired two reports with footage of North Korean citizens reacting to news of Kim\u2019s visit to Vietnam, according to BBC Monitoring. The coverage included interviews with workers and officials praising Kim\u2019s leadership.\nAll eyes will be on how North Korea\u2019s media interpret the outcome of the Hanoi summit. Their reaction to Kim\u2019s first meeting with Trump offered a foretaste: in its first report on the summit, KCNA offered a glowing account of the talks, name-checking Kim 16 times and crediting him with nothing less than creating the conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.",

He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump\u2019s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.\nIn August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nCohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump\u2019s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.\nHaving previously described himself as \u201cthe guy who would take a bullet for the president\u201d, when sentenced, Cohen said \u201cI have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.\u201d\nThe 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans.

Cohen is set to surrender on 6 May to begin his sentence, as ordered by a federal judge.\nIn his guilty plea, Cohen said: \u201cI made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.\u201d Individual 1 was a reference to Trump.\nTrump denies the allegations and says Cohen lied to get a lighter sentence.\nCohen also plans to tell US lawmakers are likely to hear Cohen testify that Trump asked him several times about a proposed skyscraper project in Moscow long after he secured the Republican presidential nomination.\nCohen\u2019s assertion that Trump was inquiring about the project as late as June 2016, if true, would show Trump remained personally interested in a business venture in Russia well into his candidacy.\nOn 29 November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress by telling lawmakers in 2017 that all efforts relating to the Moscow project had ceased by January 2016. In fact, Cohen said, those efforts continued until June 2016.\nTrump has repeatedly denied any collusion took place between his campaign and Moscow.\nCohen\u2019s week of interviews come as House Democrats launch multiple investigations into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and conflict-of-interest issues within the administration. House Republicans in the last Congress investigated whether Trump\u2019s campaign coordinated with Russia, but ended that inquiry over Democratic objections, saying that there was no evidence that they did so. The Senate\u2019s Russia investigation continues.\nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this article",

In 1974 his farm, Riverford, was possibly the first in the country to open for tours, which demystified farming for visitors. Riverford later became a beacon for the organic dairy, meat and vegetable movement, selling direct to customers, as his children developed various sustainable businesses on the farm.\nJohn was born in Woodford Green, then in Essex, the younger son of William Watson and Emily Halfhead. His father was a banker turned sugar grower in Trinidad, where John and his sister, Pamela, grew up. John was at Marlborough college when the second world war was declared in 1939, and, after having finished his education in Trinidad and Ontario, sailed back in time for his 18th birthday to join up.\nAfter demobilisation from the army in 1946 and a two-year agricultural degree at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1951 he took on the tenancy of Riverford, a derelict Church Commissioners\u2019 farm. The following year he married Gillian Hickling; they had five children, Louise, Rachel, Ben, Oliver and Guy, who all became involved in the farm.\nHis idealism started as a belief in new technology and techniques, and Riverford became a demonstration farm for chemical products. But John sensed the land was running down and knew he needed to change, although it was expensive and risky, and many thought organic farming was for cranks.\nJohn was a believer, yet his distinctive voice stopped him seeming too single-minded. On his retirement smallholding near Modbury he set about proving how little carbon was needed to live, by installing a mini wind turbine, waterwheel and solar panels. He created a local low-growth, utopian community, with a vegetable-growing co-operative feeding into the LETS (local exchange trading system) network. Days spent pressing apples, surrounded by children raising money for Oxfam, were his version of heaven: education for the greater good.\nJohn, who was my uncle, communed with the sea as well as the land. A solo sailor in his junk-rigged boat, Sulaire, he went where the wind took him. He objected to planning a route and wasn\u2019t a natural maintenance hand. Thus he would often be found moored in a creek waiting for a spare part, while reading intensely or painting a watercolour.\nWhen 89, John said: \u201cThe older I get, the more I think about the future than the past.\u201d Certainly the more he aged the more he flourished, his 70s and 80s being probably his most fulfilled years. He died with Wendell Berry\u2019s Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front next to his bed. He inspired a huge number of people through his example, his transparent integrity and his optimism.\nHis coffin was made by one of his sons from larches he planted on the farm 40 years ago, and painted with his life\u2019s story by the whole family. His grave on the farm is next to Gillian\u2019s, looking over the land he redeemed and across to Dartmoor.\nGillian died in 1998. John is survived by his children, 14 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.",

        "content": "Economic fears raised as online subscriptions plummet in months following launch of levy created to curb \u2018gossip\u2019\nMillions of people in Uganda have abandoned social media after punishing taxes were imposed on the use of networking sites and on money transactions using mobile phones.\nA daily levy, introduced in July to tame \u201cidle talk\u201d online and raise revenue, affects more than 60 online platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. To use such sites, Ugandans are expected to pay a tax of 200 Ugandan shillings (4p) a day.\nIn the three months following the introduction of the levy, the number of internet subscriptions to such services fell by more than 2.5 million, according to the Uganda Communications Commission. Fears have been raised over the impact on the economy.\nAt the time the tax was imposed, David Bahati, Uganda\u2019s finance minister, said the legislation aimed to raise revenue for public services. However, the president, Yoweri Museveni, wrote to the finance ministry in March urging the introduction of the tax as a way to deal with the consequences of online \u201cgossip\u201d.\nCritics have described the tax as an attempt to restrict free speech, and warned of the damaging impact on the economy. A lack of formal banking services in Uganda means many people rely on mobile phone companies to send money by text message.\n\u201cThe tax has not generated the revenue the government anticipated,\u201d said Irene Ikomu, a lawyer based in the capital, Kampala. Technology and financial sectors have instead been hit, said Ikomu.\n The number of people paying the tax for sites listed as \u201cOver the Top \u201d (OTT) \u2013 chosen by the government because they offer voice and messaging services \u2013 fell by 1.2 million.\nThe value of mobile money transactions also fell by almost a quarter, to 14.8tn Ugandan shillings (\u00a33.4bn) between June and September.\nIn the Naguru area of Kampala, Paul Cise, who sells data for Nov Mobile Limited, said he has been forced to cut staff because of the levy. \u201cCustomers are not happy about [the tax]. Many have resisted it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made business very difficult. I can\u2019t manage to pay employees and pay rent.\u201d\nFlorence Acen, a mobile money agent in Kyaliwajjala, in Uganda\u2019s Wakiso district, said she had lost business since the tax was introduced. The levy eats up the commission she previously earned from the lowest paying customers, she said, forcing her to turn such clients away. \u201cIt makes us too busy for nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tell them that OTT network is off. I can\u2019t waste my time.\u201d\nThe plummeting number of internet subscribers has boosted calls for the tax to be scrapped, though Ibrahim Bbosa, spokesperson of the Uganda Communications Commission, expects usage to recover. The drop in data use was due to customers adjusting their behaviour, he said.\n\u201cIf I can access internet at work, I would rather access it at work and probably not access it when I am off work premises,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably, sooner or later, people will realise this is something [they] can live with. The pattern will return to normal.\u201d\nHuman rights experts say that while the statistics on internet use are concerning, the true impact of the tax on civic engagement and freedom of speech remains to be seen.\n\u201cSocial media has become the major source of news and political information,\u201d said Ikomu. \u201cHeightened exposure to information via the internet has led to Ugandan citizens being more critical about political conditions in the country.\u201d\nIn 2016, Museveni ordered all social media sites to be shut down during the elections to stop the spread of misleading information.\n\u201cWith less than two years to the next election, and a confirmation that the president will be running for another term, we can only expect even more restrictions on the free flow of information,\u201d said Ikomu.\n This article was amended on 28 February 2019 to clarify that Uganda\u2019s social media tax has impacted internet services, rather than overall usage.",

The fashion house has also developed a plan to \u201cincrease our consciousness and understanding of social issues\u201d.\nThe brand said it would increase staff diversity by expanding its creative arts scholarship internationally and providing full-time employment for 50 graduates from the programme over the next five years, among other initiatives.\nBurberry also pledged to champion those who help others by supporting \u201corganisations promoting diversity and inclusion and providing assistance to people in crisis, including the Samaritans\u201d. It gave no further details of what this will entail.\nSamaritans said: \u201cSamaritans has been approached by Burberry, but nothing has been agreed.\u201d\nThe row over the item erupted when the model Liz Kennedy posted a photograph of the hoodie on Instagram with a caption criticising Tisci and \u201ceveryone at Burberry\u201d.\n\u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is not glamorous nor edgy and since this show is dedicated to the youth expressing their voice, here I go.

It\u2019s an honour to be together in a country, Vietnam, where they have rolled out the red carpet and they are very honoured to have us,\u201d the US president told reporters as the two men sat alongside each other before brief introductory talks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be with you. We had a very good first summit \u2026 Some people would like it to go quicker, but I\u2019m satisfied. You\u2019re satisfied. We want to be happy with what we\u2019re doing.\n\u201cI thought the first summit was a great success. And I think this one hopefully will be equal or greater than the first. And we made a lot of progress \u2026 I think the biggest progress was our relationship, which is really a good one.\u201d\nTrump continued the approach he has pursued since Singapore, to flatter Kim and hold up the prospect of great prosperity for North Korea if he agreed to disarm.\n\u201cI think your country has tremendous economic potential \u2013 unbelievable, unlimited. I think you will have a tremendous future with your country \u2013 a great leader. And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen,\u201d he said.\nIn his own remarks, Kim returned the compliment, saying he \u201ctruly believes this successful summit is because of [the] courageous decision by Trump [to meet]\u201d.\n\u201cSince we last met, there has been some who misunderstood situation and some past hostilities, but we overcame that. A lot of patience is needed.\u201d\nAfter a few minutes of private conversation, the two leaders sat down to dinner at the hotel at a small round table with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Kim was accompanied by Kim Yong-chol, the vice-chairman of North Korea\u2019s ruling party, and the foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho.\nTrump said the main summit talks would take place on Thursday and predicted there would be a press conference when they ended.",

        "content": "Kiln, London Fear and fleeting joy punctuate an exploration of family dynamics, charting the upheaval of divorce and adolescence\nFlorian Zeller\u2019s remarkable play completes a trilogy that views a single family from different perspectives. In The Father, the focus was on aged dementia and in The Mother on middle-aged angst. Now Zeller turns his attention to adolescent depression and the result, while displaying his usual technical skill, reminds us that his greatest gift is for generating emotion. I\u2019d defy anyone not to be moved by this study of the disruptive dynamics of family life.\nWe sense something is amiss from the first moment when we see Laurie Kynaston as the teenage Nicolas alone in a room obsessively scribbling on a wall. His mother, Anne, then turns up at the home her ex-husband, Pierre, shares with his new lover, Sofia, and their baby son. Anne explains that Nicolas is unwell, has played truant from school for three months and that she can no longer cope. The solution \u2013 for the boy to live with his father \u2013 only makes matters worse. Nicolas lies, engages in self-mutilation, turns suicidal and even when he gets psychiatric help, it offers no answer.\nOne of the play\u2019s many virtues is that it provides no easy explanation for Nicolas\u2019s condition. It may spring from the divided loyalty he feels towards his divorced parents or it may have its origins in Pierre\u2019s own difficult relationship with his father. But Zeller doesn\u2019t analyse depression: he simply presents it as it frighteningly is.\nThere\u2019s a telling moment when Anne, seeking to play the role of a sympathetic mum, suggests to Nicolas that his problems may be the result of breaking up with a girl: Kynaston\u2019s response is to curl himself into a ball and beat the floor in frustration at the facile nature of the idea. As Nicolas says, in Christopher Hampton\u2019s limpid translation: \u201cSometimes I feel I\u2019m not made for this life.\u201d Zeller is a shrewd enough dramatist to show that even in a fraught situation there are fleeting moments of happiness. One comes when Pierre, a work-obsessed lawyer, is encouraged by Sofia to demonstrate the talent for dance that first attracted her to him.\nNicolas spontaneously apes his dad\u2019s exhibitionist hip-swaying and the stage suddenly floods with a joy that is just as quickly shattered. And, even though it seemed improbable that it would take three months for Nicolas\u2019s absenteeism from school to be noticed, the work is ingeniously structured: there is a surprise ending that, far from being tricksy, reinforces the play\u2019s direct access to the heart.\nMichael Longhurst\u2019s immaculate production and Lizzie Clachan\u2019s design underline the tension between bourgeois order and emotional chaos, and the acting throughout is excellent. John Light captures perfectly Pierre\u2019s mix of guilt and concern and, suddenly kicking over a sofa in fury, movingly shows the powerlessness of a parent confronting filial depression. There is strong support from Amanda Abbington as the equally uncomprehending Anne, and from Amaka Okafor as Sofia, who sees Nicolas as an obstinate barrier to her own happiness. But the lasting image of the production is of Kynaston\u2019s Nicolas, whose features suggest a total withdrawal from the world into his own inexplicable hell.\nThe Son is at the Kiln, London, until 6 April.",

        "content": "A new recruitment drive is welcome, but the campaign sugar-coats the sometimes brutal reality of the role\nCare work is extremely rewarding and fulfilling, but also often back-breaking, poorly paid, mentally, emotionally and physically draining, and undertrained. It is a job in a sector desperate for more funding at every level of provision, as well as better training standards, pay and working conditions.\nA Department of Health and Social Care recruitment campaign aims to attract much-needed new staff to the sector. The campaign\u2019s hashtag, #Everydayisdifferent, is a great banner under which to show the variety of tasks, skills, people and jobs that social care involves.\nAny campaign that brings more people to a critically short-staffed industry is always welcome, and something the National Association of Care & Support Workers (Nacas) would want to support. We are also happy to back any campaign that promotes care as a rewarding job, and recognises the real difference the profession makes to people\u2019s lives.\nAt Nacas, we campaign for the increased representation and reputation of care work \u2013 with a skilled workforce that contributes enormously to social care and wider society, as in our #ProfessionalCareWorkersDay celebrations and campaign. People working in social care often speak of their work not as just \u201ca job\u201d and make many personal sacrifices to remain in posts that bring others happiness.\nBut new recruits have to come to the industry with realistic expectations. The new campaign seems to lack balance, creating misperceptions about the realities of the job. Many of the responses I have heard from care workers are about the fact that the role is not \u2013 despite what the campaign suggests \u2013 all about dancing, bird feeding and going out together.\nMany care workers wish they could organise days out for their clients but all too often they are simply given no time for it. With turnover rates so high in social care already, what are the chances of retaining those young people who apply as the result of a campaign that masks the sometimes brutal reality of working in the sector? New recruits should be prepared to be on their feet all day, providing personal care and dealing with challenging and sometimes aggressive behaviour.\nRecruitment is only one of the problems the sector faces. Social care is an extremely fragmented sector, and training standards and timeframes can be completely different from one place to another. In some places, care workers have not had a pay rise for years, and receive little appreciation either.\nThe campaign should be clearer about wages: the jobs site that goes with it gives an impression that the average care worker is paid more than the national average of \u00a37.76. More effort should also be made to better look after those already working in the sector and improve retention rates.\nCare staff\u2019s hard work goes hand in hand with job satisfaction, the pride of making people smile and helping them live fulfilling lives. Care is an extremely valuable and important profession that can break your heart and body. The strength of those who do this every day needs to be celebrated, but not sugar-coated.\nThe campaign will hopefully lead to more conversations about the industry and its needs. But in itself, it will not fix the sector, which is at breaking point. There is much work to be done to influence policy and public attitudes towards the conditions care workers deserve, and this campaign is only a drop in the ocean towards making those changes a reality.\n Karolina Gerlich is a care worker and is chief executive and founding director of the National Association of Care & Support Workers",

However, the discovery of a number of hidden jokes \u2013 allegedly critical of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \u2013 has ignited a firestorm of online criticism.\nThe red seal on this in-game talisman reads, right to left, \u201cXi Jinping / Winnie-the-Pooh\u201d in an older form of Chinese writing, referencing a 2017 meme comparing the Chinese leader to the Disney character. The characters on the corners are homonyms for internet slang that means roughly \u201cyour mum is stupid\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re an idiot\u201d.\nThe game was initially removed from sale in China on the popular PC gaming platform Steam, and is now unavailable in all territories. The developers have confirmed that they have removed the game from the store temporarily for an internal technical review, as well as to confirm that no other hidden messages remain.\nDiscussion of the game has been banned or removed on many popular Chinese social media sites such as Weibo. It is unclear if this is a government direction or pre-emptive self-censorship.\nDevotion and Red Candle\u2019s previous game, Detention, have also received a slew of negative reviews by users \u2013 possibly targets of a review-bombing campaign. Many reviews reference other alleged inferences that are derogatory towards Chinese people, such as a cult leader named Lu Gongmin, a homophone for \u201cmainland citizen\u201d, in a related marketing campaign.\nThe developer has apologised on 23 February and removed the politically sensitive materials in an updated version of Devotion, explaining that prototype materials containing internet memes were unintentionally not removed before launch.\n\u201cThis is purely an accident, and we have no intention for causing harm nor hatred,\u201d the apology reads. \u201cRed Candle Games take full responsibility\u2026\u201d\nThe game\u2019s Chinese partners, Indievent and Winking Entertainment, have severed relations with the developer.\nOn 23 February, Chen Chi-mai, Taiwan\u2019s vice premier, praised the game in a Facebook post, saying \u201conly in countries with democracy and freedom can creation be free from restrictions\u201d.\nTaiwanese pro-independence sentiment remains controversial in China. Last year, film director Fu Yue was censored in China after mentioning Taiwanese independence in an acceptance speech at the Taipei Golden Horse awards, a festival and awards programme founded by the Taiwanese government. Chinese gamers are concerned about the possibility of tighter censorship on Steam, and other popular games such as Fortnite and PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which are technically available in the PRC but have not been approved by government regulators and could be banned at any time. Last week, Variety reported that China has stopped accepting applications for video games licences due to a backlog.",

Her hat was a tip to The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Henry wore a Mary Poppins-style blue cape and hair and makeup evoking Black Panther.

As costume designers we struggle with people in our own industry UNDERSTANDING our job, on this one night where the work is supposed to be elevated this is perhaps the most egregious misrepresentation not only of taste \u2026 but of value to the film-making process.\n\u201cWe are not just \u2018shoppers\u2019, as our job is so often misunderstood \u2026 this kind of mockery only underscores frustration. Feels like major steps backwards \u2026 SHAME on the Academy for allowing this to be broadcast.\u201d\nPhillips, who has long worked as Madonna\u2019s stylist, and was costume designer on Madonna\u2019s 2012\u2019s film W.E., for which Phillips was Oscar nominated, won broad approval for her comments on social media.\nPaula Bradley, costume designer on the 2018 season of American Horror Story, proposed an open letter to the LA Times, while Superstore costume designer Alix Hester agreed about the need to \u201cget very concerned about the lack of respect for our craft. Would they ever ridicule production design or cinematography in this way? I\u2018m tired of being called wardrobe with no understanding that we create costumes that inform a character and tell a story.\u201d\nOthers defended Katja Cahill, costume designer for the Oscars ceremony, who on Monday told the Hollywood Reporter her intention had been for McCarthy and Henry\u2019s outfits to look like \u201call the costumes sort of threw up\u201d.\nPitch Perfect 3 costume designer Salvador P\u00e9rez responded to Phillips\u2019s post by saying: \u201cA costume designer designed this and is very proud of it, she has posted many pics to her Instagram account about it, it may not be your taste, but it was designed by a fellow costume designer, not a producer.\n\u201cThe beauty of costume design is that we get to show creativity in many ways, this was her vision. Be careful how you dismiss your colleagues\u2019 work.\u201d\nIn response, Phillips praised the efforts of Cahill and her team, who \u201cobviously worked meticulously to create such elaborate comedy. So bravo for doing her/their job well!\n\u201cI do not agree with the content and context of how that script was written. This is my opinion, and the opinion of many people here, as well as many people who contacted me after seeing the show. We can agree to disagree.

May says a report says UK growth will be higher than Germany\u2019s. Borrowing is down, she says.\nCorbyn says May may not have had time to look at the Bank\u2019s forecasts. It says there is a one in four chance of a recession. Is May\u2019s shambolic Brexit to blame, or her lack of an industrial strategy? May says there has been consistent growth. Under Labour, there would be capital flight and \u00a31tn of borrowing.\nCorbyn says the incomes of the richest have grown, while the poorest are getting poorer. Will May commit to ending the benefits freeze? May says income inequality is lower than it was under Labour. And the lowest earners have had their fastest pay rise for 20 years under the national minimum wage.\nCorbyn says the Tories opposed the principle of the minimum wage. He points out Amber Rudd admitted universal credit was driving people to food banks. May says changes are being made to universal credit. She says welfare should be fair for claimants, but also for taxpayers. Absolute child poverty is at a record low.\nCorbyn says it is clearly not working, because people doing two or three jobs have to access food banks. May used to talk about the just-about-managing. But they are not managing. Child poverty is up, pensioner poverty is up, homelessness is up, manufacturing is in recession, and austerity is not over. Are any of these burning injustices a priority for the prime minister?\nMay says manufacturing is not in recession. And Corbyn is wrong about the lowest earners; they have had the highest rise for 20 years because of the national living wage. Income tax has been cut and fuel duty frozen. She says Labour voted against these tax cuts. It is working people who always pay the price of Labour.\nIs Jeremy Corbyn expecting an early election? It sounded a bit like it, because that would explain his decision to opt for a portmanteau PMQs strategy, lobbing attack lines at Theresa May on a wide range of economic and welfare policies. It sounded a bit like a medley of Labour conference greatest hits.\nThe problem with this approach is that it is hard to get anything to stick, and most of the exchanges felt like a high-scoring draw, with May firing back with her own CCHQ talking points. Corbyn\u2019s point about increasing food bank use and welfare changes being to blame was powerful, but because his questions were wide-ranging, rather than focused, May got off rather lightly. (If you ask about universal credit, you are entitled to an answer. If you try to shoehorn UC, plus the two-child limit, plus the benefit cap, plus Sure Start centres into your questions, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you receive a broad-brush response.)\nThat said, it was interesting that Corbyn felt confident enough to start with an attack on May\u2019s record on economic growth (which is conventionally seen as more of a Tory issue than a Corbyn one). And Corbyn\u2019s peroration (ie, his sixth question) was first-class. This is the one that his office will clip for YouTube and other social media, and for that audience it is all that matters. As May pointed out in her response, not everything he said may have passed the fact-check test, but it was enough to make the outing a Corbyn success.\nJeremy Corbyn:\nYesterday, figures showed that the incomes of the top fifth increased by 4.7% last year, while incomes of the poorest fifth fell by 1.6%. Will the prime minister now commit to ending the benefit freeze or does she believe that rising poverty is a price worth paying? \u2026 She used to talk about the just-about-managing. Well, they\u2019re not managing any more.\nTheresa May:\nYou can never be too apologetic for antisemitism. I think this sums up Labour under their leader: they lose the honourable member for Liverpool Wavertree [Luciana Berger] and they keep the honourable member for Derby North [Chris Williamson]. That tells you all you need to know about the Labour leadership.",

The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has ordered that the British-born woman\u2019s citizenship be revoked.\nIn a statement to the Victoria Derbyshire show, which was sent the shooting target images of Begum, Ultimate Airsoft Range said: \u201cThe targets provide some fantastic reactions and conversations and allow people to have some lighthearted fun and bring out the inner child in us all.\n\u201cThe targets don\u2019t always reflect personal opinions and we don\u2019t want to condone terrorism.

I\u2019ve always applied it on the strict advice of legal advisers in the Home Office and more broadly in the government that when the power is deployed, with respect to that individual, they already have more than one citizenship.\u201d\nThis measure had never seemingly been used, he added: \u201cI have not used that power, and to the best of my knowledge none of my predecessors have used the power that was given in 2014.\u201d\nBegum\u2019s family has stressed she does not have Bangladeshi citizenship, while Bangladesh has also said she does not, and will not be allowed into the country.\nAssuming she does not have Bangladeshi nationality, it appears hard to see how Javid could enforce the order set out in the letter, which has prompted criticism that he was seeking to exploit populist feeling without proper attention to the law.\nJavid was asked by the Labour MP Kate Green whether it was \u201cmorally right to export the problem\u201d to Bangladesh, rather than deal with Begum through UK courts.\nThe home secretary argued that his priority had to be to protect the UK. Asked again if he thought this was morally suspect, he added: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I just don\u2019t see it like that.\u201d\nHe also confirmed that Begum\u2019s baby would be a UK national, saying that children of British-born mothers had that right. However, he added, it would be \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d to assist the infant, as Begum was in a refugee camp in northern Syria.\nBegum left the UK along with two schoolfriends. Her case was thrust back into the spotlight last week when she declared her wish to return for the sake of her child in an interview with the Times.",

Users do, however, have to pay for at least four weeks up front, while TfL only takes the money as the journeys are made.\nIn a blogpost announcing the pass, the company said: \u201cCities are complicated. Our mission has been to simplify them. We\u2019ve solved (and are still improving) many hard problems in urban mobility: multimodal routing to help with directions, a data factory that fixes open data so users can get accurate information, and a myriad of product features that solve everyday use cases. But we\u2019ve always been missing something: ticketing and payment integration so that we can help users with the complete experience.\u201d\nCitymapper, launched in 2011 as a mapping app to help Londoners travel their city by public transport, now operates in almost 40 cities around the world. But the company has never had a reliable source of revenue in that time, instead operating on almost $50m of venture capital funding.\nWhile the pass will bring in revenue, it will also result in the company losing money, at least in the short term. Technically, it operates as a simple pre-paid debit card, with Citymapper paying TfL for each journey its users take until they hit the standard weekly price cap.\nThat means that every user who reaches the daily Tube price cap (\u00a37.00 for zones one and two) at least five days in seven will result in Citymapper losing money on them that week. The company\u2019s explicit plan to counter that loss is to expand the pass by bundling in ever more private offerings, where it has more power to negotiate prices, until it offers a bundle that covers everything from dockless bikes, through rental cars, to ridesharing services.\nIt already offers a premium version of the pass for \u00a339 a week which includes unlimited use of the TfL-run cycle hire network, and \u00a310 a week credit on another experimental service, the CityMapper \u201cSmart Ride\u201d bus/taxi hybrid.\n\u201cRight now, we see a real proliferation of all these private transport players and all these different modes, and more complexity. We want to see if we can abstract it away, and say to the user: we will take care of the hassle for you,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive and founder Azmat Yusuf told Wired magazine last week. \u201cAny other services that come along can be added over time. If we have scooters coming into the city, we\u2019ll figure out a way we can provide you with access to that as well.\u201d\nBut the launch of the service has prompted concerns from some that the company\u2019s end goal is to try and burn its funding to establish a large base of users that it can then wield in political battles with city authorities to gain better terms for itself. That model has brought success for companies like Uber and Airbnb, which have reshaped regulations around their needs in cities including San Francisco, New York and Paris.\nFor its part, TfL says it welcomes the move, although Citymapper had not told the operator it was planning on launching the pass before the first media reports arrived last week. In a statement, the transport body said: \u201cWe are aware of Citymapper\u2019s plans to introduce a subscription model, bundling together a number of transport options in London, and welcome products which promote public transport, walking and cycling.\u201d",

In a statement, Williamson said it \u201cpains me greatly \u2026 that anyone should believe that it is my intention to minimise the cancerous and pernicious nature of antisemitism\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cI deeply regret, and apologise for, my recent choice of words when speaking about how the Labour party has responded to the ongoing fight against antisemitism inside of our party. I was trying to stress how much the party has done to tackle antisemitism.\n\u201cOur movement can never be \u2018too apologetic\u2019 about racism within our ranks. Whilst it is true that there have been very few cases of antisemitism in the Labour party \u2013 something I believe is often forgotten when discussing this issue \u2013 it is also true that those few are too many.\u201d\nHis remarks caused an outcry, with Watson, many Labour MPs and the GMB trade union leader, Tim Roache, as well as the anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate, calling for the whip to be withdrawn immediately.\nWatson called Williamson\u2019s apology, \u201clong-winded and heavily caveated,\u201d adding, \u201cif it was in my gift I would have removed the whip from him already\u201d.\nChris Williamson has produced a long-winded and heavily caveated apology. It is not good enough. If it was in my gift I would have removed the whip from him already. pic.twitter.com/IuEpDM1Ak2\nCorbyn\u2019s spokesperson called the comments \u201cdeeply offensive and inappropriate and fall below the standards we expect of MPs\u2026 Downplaying the problem of antisemitism makes it harder for us to tackle it.\u201d But he said Williamson would continue to take the Labour whip while his behaviour is investigated.\nHe also confirmed that Lord Falconer, the former lord chancellor, has been appointed to examine Labour\u2019s internal processes, and increase transparency about the way antisemitism cases are considered by the party.\nTensions between Watson and Corbyn had already been rising since last week, when the deputy leader urged Corbyn to \u201cbroaden out\u201d his shadow cabinet to reflect the range of opinion on the backbenchers.\nOn Sunday, he warned Corbyn that Labour faces a \u201ccrisis\u201d; and asked him to examine 50 cases of antisemitism personally. Corbyn\u2019s office responded by insisting it was not the leader\u2019s role to involve himself in the party\u2019s disciplinary processes.\nTheresa May also called on Corbyn to suspend Williamson. Speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions in response to the Conservative MP James Cleverly, May said the departure of the Labour MP Luciana Berger following antisemitic abuse, while Williamson remained in the party, \u201ctells you all you need to know about the Labour leadership\u201d.\nStella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said she told Williamson \u201cabout the toxic culture antisemitism created and why it had to be expunged not ignored \u2026 Those who perpetuate it or minimise it bring the party into disrepute.\u201d\nThe Nottingham South MP, Lilian Greenwood, told the Guardian \u201ca rap over the knuckles and a request to be nicer\u201d was insufficient. \n She said: \u201cThis is a pattern of deliberately provocative behaviour. If the party are serious about tackling antisemitism and want to be seen to be serious then he should be subject to a disciplinary investigation.

They added that his facial hair would also impact on the effectiveness of the respiratory mask he would need to wear.\nLawyers for the council went on to conclude that the man, who had been unemployed for two years, would have received an automatic job on completing his training and that they had to act in the interests of the taxpayer.\nThe man responded that he would have been willing to wear an alternative respiratory mask on the market suitable for those with beards but the court concluded that the training required the use of a specific mask.\nThe court\u2019s appeal board ruled that the decision was \u201cunmistakably an infringement of [the man\u2019s] right to religious freedom\u201d but that this was tolerable if there was a legal basis and society required it.\nIn the summing up the judges took into account the lack of any prospect of other employment given the man\u2019s history including time in jail, psychological problems and a gambling addiction.\n\u201cThe provision offered \u2026 did not involve any internship or training, but was provided with a job guarantee\u201d, the court said. \u201cFor the appellant, the training was therefore an excellent, concrete chance for regular work \u2026\n\u201cDue to the refusal to participate in the training, the appellant did not make use of the guaranteed opportunity to gain access to the labour market. As a result, he put undue pressure on the public funds to the detriment of those who, in solidarity, bear the costs of the provisions in the Participatiewet.\u201d\nThe judges ruled that the suspension of payments was \u201cdeemed necessary in the interest of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d.\nThe Dutch welfare system has undergone significant changes in recent years corresponding with a fall in unemployment from 6.9% in 2014 to around 3.9% today, the pre-financial crisis level.

She warned that 40% of medical staff had left the country and said hospital stocks of medicine had dwindled to 20% of the required level.\nDiCarlo said the \u201cprotracted crisis\u201d in the country had led in recent weeks to an \u201calarming escalation of tensions\u201d. Four people died and hundreds were injured in clashes last weekend at the country\u2019s borders.\nSecurity council members clashed over the increasingly politicised humanitarian aid efforts to Venezuela, the government of which, led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, is backed by China and Russia, and opposed by the US and a number of European and Latin American countries, who want Maduro to step down.\nDiCarlo warned of the \u201cgrim reality\u201d facing a country where citizens are dying of preventable causes and 3.4 million people have fled the worsening conditions.\nCommenting on the recent politicisation of aid efforts to Venezuela, DiCarlo said the UN was coordinating efforts to deliver assistance as close as possible to Venezuelans in need. She added that aid delivery should be free \u201cfrom political objectives and delivered on the basis of need\u201d.\nDiCarlo noted that while supplies sent by Russia and China have entered the country, in coordination with the Venezuelan government, supplies from the US and other countries have been stockpiled at the Colombian and Brazilian borders. Earmarked for distribution by the Venezuelan opposition, these supplies remained blocked from entering the country by Venezuelan authorities, she said.\nThe politicisation of aid efforts has caused widespread alarm in the international aid community. Many have watched with dismay as supporters of both sides have sought to funnel aid to the advantage of one or other of the rival parties, some trying to back the government of Maduro, others the opposition led by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-declared interim president, who is championed by the US.\nDiCarlo\u2019s presentation to the security council followed violent clashes at the weekend that focused on failed efforts to deliver aid to the Venezuelan opposition.\nQuoting Colombian and UN human rights officials, DiCarlo blamed the involvement of pro-government armed elements in the violent attacks on protestors at Venezuela\u2019s borders that left four dead and 285 injured.\nSpeaking on behalf of the US, Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s special representative for Venezuela, called on the members of the security council to \u201cpressure the illegitimate regime to peacefully step down\u201d, accusing Maduro of preferring to \u201cblock and burn donated medicine and bread than see it in the hands of Venezuelan children\u201d.\nRussia\u2019s representative, Vassily Nebenzia, countered by painting US-backed efforts to deliver aid at the weekend as \u201can attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo\u201d, adding that the aid had not been requested by the Venezuelan government.\nDespite the deadly clashes at the weekend, the Trump administration appeared to be running into increasing resistance to its approach to the standoff. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Wednesday that while it was clear Maduro had \u201cno intention of negotiating\u201d, Spain was opposed to any foreign military intervention in the economically-strapped country.\nHe \u201cdoes not want sincere negotiations\u201d, said Spain\u2019s socialist leader, who earlier this month recognised Guaid\u00f3 as interim leader of Venezuela after Maduro rejected pressure to call a snap general election.\nS\u00e1nchez, however, firmly rejected any foreign military intervention to topple Maduro, which the US has touted as a possibility.\nWe express \u201cour rejection of any non-peaceful solution, and particularly any foreign military intervention in Venezuela,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\u201cThere are some mistakes of the past that must not be committed again.\u201d\n The headline on this article was amended on 5 March 2019. It had previously suggested that infant mortality was said to have doubled during Venezuela\u2019s political crisis.",

Schipol is continental Europe\u2019s second busiest airport, after Charles de Gaulle in Paris.\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron urged the Dutch government to \u201cclarify its intentions\u201d while his finance minister Bruno Le Maire described the Dutch move as \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d Le Maire said the business should be \u201cmanaged without national public interference\u201d.\nFrench officials said they were upset that they had not been informed in advance of the Dutch stake-building plans.\nLocal media reports said the the government in Paris was only informed of the share purchase an hour before it was officially confirmed. \u201cThe way that the stake was built up was more like that done by a corporate raider, rather than a state shareholder,\u201d a French finance ministry official told Reuters.\nThe official added that the purchase was an \u201cunfriendly, surprising move that is extremely detrimental to Air France-KLM financially\u201d.\nThe source declined to say whether the French state would raise its stake in reaction to the Dutch move but said Paris was going to ask France\u2019s financial markets watchdog to examine heavy trading in the airline\u2019s shares prior to the Dutch government\u2019s announcement. Le Maire will meet Hoekstra later this week to discuss the airline.\nShares in Air France-KLM were down by 15% at one point, in the wake of the disclosure of the investment by the Netherlands, prompting the French official to point out that Dutch taxpayers had already seen the value of their investment plummet. They closed down 12%, at \u20ac11.24, valuing the airline at \u20ac4.82bn, as analysts voiced concerns that the two government\u2019s competing interests could have an impact on the carrier\u2019s strategy and growth.\nThe row comes amid reports that the Dutch government had waded into discussions about the future of KLM\u2019s chief executive, Pieter Elbers, amid doubts over whether he would keep his job.\nElbers was said to be sceptical about plans by the company\u2019s overall boss, Canadian Ben Smith, to further cement ties between the two airlines, which operate as separate carriers under one holding company.\nKLM is the more profitable of the two airlines.\nThe French budget minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin called on states to interfere in the alliance as little as possible.\n\u201cWe must have good relations with our friends from the Netherlands,\u201d Darmanin told Europe 1 radio.\n\u201cIt is especially necessary that the states are involved as little as possible in the running of a large company like this. We must let the people of Air France-KLM work.\u201d",

        "content": "Supreme court says investigation into killing of Belfast solicitor was ineffective\nThe official investigation into the 1989 murder of the Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane, one of the most notorious killings of the Troubles, was ineffective and failed to meet the standards required under human rights law, the supreme court has ruled.\nIn a unanimous judgment, five justices said the investigation carried out by Sir Desmond de Silva in 2011 was frustrated by his inability to compel witnesses to testify about the killing. The court did not, however, order a public inquiry and has left it up to the government to decide whether further investigation is needed.\nFinucane, 39, a Belfast lawyer who represented a number of high-profile republicans, was shot dead in front of his family by loyalist gunmen who forced their way into his Belfast home 30 years ago this month in an attack found to have involved state collusion.\nLawyers for his widow, Geraldine Finucane, have argued that the decision to hold only a paper-based review of the killing rather than a public hearing led to there being no effective scrutiny of the murder.\nAfter Finucane\u2019s death it emerged that the loyalist paramilitary intelligence officer responsible for directing Ulster Defence Association attacks, Brian Nelson, was an agent controlled by the British army\u2019s force research unit.\nA senior police officer, John Stevens, conducted a series of investigations into the murder. In 2001, political agreement between the UK and Irish governments established that an international judge would investigate the Finucane killing, among others. It was agreed that an inquiry would be held into Finucane\u2019s murder, but that decision was reversed in 2010 when David Cameron\u2019s government came to power.\nUnder article 2 of the European convention on human rights, states have not only a duty not to kill people but also an obligation to carry out effective investigations into deaths.\nDelivering judgment, Lord Kerr, a supreme court judge and former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, said the critical point was whether an effective investigation had taken place. That \u201chas not occurred\u201d, he said.\nDe Silva\u2019s conclusions were \u201cnot criticised for their failure to to identify the people involved\u201d. Rather, the court said, it was a matter that \u201cif he had been able to compel witnesses; if he had been able to probe their accounts; if he had been given the chance to press those whose testimony might have led to identification of those involved in targeting Mr Finucane \u2026 [then] one might have concluded that all means possible to identify those involved had been deployed.\u201d\nThe court continued: \u201cAbsent those vital steps, the conclusion that an article 2-compliant inquiry into Mr Finucane\u2019s death has not yet taken place is inescapable.\u201d\nKerr concluded: \u201cI would therefore make a declaration that there has not been an article 2-compliant inquiry into the death of Patrick Finucane. It does not follow that a public inquiry of the type which [his widow] seeks must be ordered.\n\u201cIt is for the state to decide, in the light of the incapacity of Sir Desmond de Silva\u2019s review and inquiries which preceded it to meet the procedural requirement of article 2, what form of investigation, if indeed any is now feasible, is required in order to meet that requirement.\u201d\nFinucane was having supper with his wife and three children on a Sunday evening when gunmen burst into their north Belfast home and shot him no fewer than 14 times.\nKerr said: \u201cHis devoted widow, Geraldine, and [their] children have waged a relentless campaign to have a proper investigation conducted into the circumstances of Mr Finucane\u2019s murder.\n \u201cIt became clear at an early stage that those responsible for killing Mr Finucane were so-called loyalists. Before long it also emerged that there was collusion between Mr Finucane\u2019s murderers and members of the security forces.\u201d\n Since then, Kerr said, investigations had \u201cnot uncovered the identity of those members of the security services who engaged in the collusion nor the precise nature of the assistance they gave to the murderers\u201d.\nOutside the court, Geraldine Finucane said the ruling was a victory for the family. Although the judges had not ordered the government to hold a public inquiry, she said, their conclusions pointed to the inevitable necessity of holding one.\n\u201cThe public inquiry that my family and I have fought for over three decades has moved closer through this great victory today. My family and I have endured three private police investigations, two confidential documentary reviews, secret government negotiations and a long and difficult court case,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd today we face the world with one simple message: we have won.\n\u201cThis started off by just asking questions about the murder of Pat and gradually, as more information came to light, the word \u2018collusion\u2019 came into parlance and so many people realised it affected them too. Other people need to know the truth as well. It\u2019s not just about closure for us, it affects all of our community.\u201d\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s president, Mary Lou McDonald, said: \u201cToday\u2019s judgment is a watershed moment in the campaign for access to truth and justice about collusion. At Weston Park in 2001, the British government agreed to a public inquiry into Pat\u2019s murder. That has not yet happened.\n\u201cThe British government should now immediately fulfil its obligation to hold a public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane.\u201d\nThe chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, Les Allamby, welcomed the verdict. \u201cThe commission calls upon the government to set out clearly how it will remedy this failure without any further delay,\u201d he said.\nPeter Madden, a Belfast solicitor and former partner of Patrick Finucane, said: \u201cThe decision taken by David Cameron to hold a review [rather than a public inquiry] has been overturned by the supreme court. So it\u2019s back to the British government to decide what they are going to do instead to comply with the article 2 requirements [ for an effective investigation].\u201d\nYasmine Ahmed, the director of Rights Watch (UK), which has been advocating for a public inquiry since the murder, said: \u201cThe road to justice has been 30 years long, but today marks a significant victory.\n\u201cThe government, who in 2012 accepted shocking levels of collusion between the government and paramilitaries in relation to Finucane\u2019s murder, is now required to establish an inquiry that is genuinely effective and independent that can lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible.\u201d",

We regret this step, but it is reality and we now have to find a good solution.\u201d\nThe Spanish prime minister,Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who has been a thorn in the UK prime minister\u2019s side in recent months, told his parliament in Madrid that there would be conditions attached to an extension of the article 50 negotiating period.\nMay had suggested in the Commons on Tuesday that the UK could seek a short two-month extension for further talks should parliament not ratify the Brexit deal by 13 March.\nBut S\u00e1nchez, who is facing a general election in late April, said he would want to be clear that it was not merely delaying an inevitable crash-landing for the UK out of the EU.\nThe Spanish premier also insisted that there was no prospect of the EU softening in its rejection of a time limit on the Irish backstop or unilateral exit mechanism should the government wish to leave the shared customs territory it envisages to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nS\u00e1nchez said: \u201cThe position of Spain, as I have conveyed to Prime Minister Theresa May in different telephone conversations, is the same: it is not possible to temporarily limit the backstop or to allow a unilateral exit from it.\n\u201cDue to its nature as a security mechanism, it is not possible to set a term for it. It is not only a matter of solidarity with one of our partners, Ireland, but also of preserving the peace that was achieved in Northern Ireland decades ago.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez, who at one point threatened to veto the Brexit deal unless the UK offered some assurances that Gibraltar will only be covered with Madrid\u2019s consent, added: \u201cIt cannot be ruled out that the British prime minister requests an extension of article 50 of the EU treaty as she said yesterday.\n\u201cAnd I want to make clear before this possible position of the British government, that although Spain is not going to oppose the concession of an eventual extension, it must have a certain perspective of resolution. Prolonging uncertainty by postponing deadlines is not a reasonable nor desirable alternative.\u201d\nAn extension of article 50 requires unanimous support of all 27 heads of state and government. While all leaders would be under pressure to assent to a request by the UK, of whatever length, many leaders would favour a lengthier extension if there is no clear prospect of a deal getting through parliament in the coming months.\nIn Brussels, there is a debate on how best to respond to an expected request, with some senior officials warming to the idea of an extension of up to 21 months to allow the UK to fully develop its plans for the future.\nSuch a lengthy delay is opposed by others, however. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted on Wednesday: \u201cIf the UK parliament rejects her deal, Theresa May would like to extend the negotiating period.\n\u201cIn my firm opinion, if this happens, this can never be longer than a couple of months so that a cross-party majority can be found. But certainly not 21 months!\n\u201cThe union has been taken hostage by the Brexit already for too long. The UK has had almost two years to make up its mind, now it is time to decide: A deal, no deal or stay. For the union it is high time that we can spend our energy on more positive projects and the in-depth reforms Europe desperately needs.\u201d\nSpeaking to parliament for the last time before the general election, S\u00e1nchez said his cabinet would use a royal decree this Friday to introduce legislation to \u201ccope with all the consequences of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. The fast-tracked legislation would then be put before parliament for approval within 30 days.\nMeanwhile, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he believed he could \u201csave\u201d the deal. \u201cIt is not accurate to say that the no-deal is the most likely scenario,\u201d Barnier told France Info radio. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. This is not yet a probability.\u201d\nEU and British negotiators are currently drafting a protocol on the backstop which the hope will allow the attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, to revise his legal advice to parliament and suggest that the backstop would only be a \u201ctemporary\u201d arrangement if triggered.\nThere are serious doubts in Brussels, however, that the assurances that will be offered can persuade sufficient MPs to back the deal. EU leaders have recently implored May to engage with Jeremy Corbyn on his offer to throw Labour\u2019s support behind the deal in return for backing a customs union with the bloc.\n\u201cThis treaty is not renegotiable, it can\u2019t be reopened,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cBut beside that we have another document, which is the political declaration, which is very precise and fixes the rules of the game for our future partnership \u2013 that\u2019s the most important, what partnership for trade, fishing, transport, university, research, Erasmus, internal security, foreign policy, defence. That can perhaps be improved.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf the Brits want it tomorrow morning to be more ambitious and for example not stop at a free trade agreement, but instead have a customs union, or even more, we\u2019re ready to renegotiate that relationship.\u201d",

But, before the retrospective letdown, there is an exhilarating kind of disorientation as we move from one narrative section to the next.\nIt is presented in three parts. We see the fraught existence of a successful middle-aged architect and his wife in Tel Aviv whose son is away doing military service; then the fraught existence of this son\u2019s unit, out in the middle of nowhere guarding a border post; and then we are back with the architect and his family. It is a triptych of scenes of which the first and third are very theatrical, like a conventional stage play, and the second \u2013 the centrepiece, perhaps \u2013 is visually weirder, at times almost hallucinatory.\nLior Ashkenazi plays Michael Feldman, well-respected architect and bearded paterfamilias: a handsome figure of a man. (I can never see him without remembering his performance as the thirtysomething secretly in love with an older woman, opposite the late Ronit Elkabetz in Dover Koshashvili\u2019s Late Marriage, back in 2001.) The difficulties in his relationship with his wife Dephna (Sarah Adler) are exposed by a traumatic official visit. We then move to a radically different scene: concerning that unit in the Israel Defense Forces. The fate of both father and son speaks volumes about official secrecy, official bad faith: a tendency on the part of the authorities to cover things up, never to admit a fault.\nThe first section is moving and Maoz creates a coup of sorts in toying with his characters\u2019 emotions \u2013 and your emotions \u2013 hitting you with an almost surreal strangeness just as you are swallowing down the lump in your throat. Unfortunately, these switchbacks of feeling are ultimately less interesting than they appear.",

He compared the election unfavourably with that of 2007, widely considered the worst in Nigeria\u2019s history, in which Buhari was runner-up and Abubakar came a distant third.\nAccording to the country\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the People\u2019s Democratic party (PDP) candidate scored 11,262,978 votes to finish second after Buhari of the All Progressives\u2019 Congress (APC), whose 15,191,847 votes secured his reelection for a second term in office.\nThe elections, Nigeria\u2019s sixth since its return to democracy in 1999, were seen as a referendum on the presidency of Buhari, the tough-talking former general who was also a military head of state in the 1980s. Despite seeming unpopular with large sections of the population, Buhari managed to retain most of his base and do well in opposition strongholds.\nThe bulk of Buhari\u2019s votes came from four of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states: Kano, Katsina, Kaduna and Kebbi, nicknamed the Kardashian sisters by election observers for their alliterative coincidence with the American celebrity family. The states have consistently given huge margins to Buhari since his first attempt at becoming civilian president in 2003. This time, they contributed a cumulative 4.2m votes \u2013 about a quarter of Buhari\u2019s eventual tally.\nLocal observers pointed to irregularities and violence during the polls, which continued into Sunday morning in some areas, hours after voting had been concluded in most states.\nAdewunmi Emoruwa of The Election Network said the poll fell short of expectations. \u201cThe numbers alone are indicting. We have already witnessed a record number of cancelled votes \u2013 more than double the numbers from the previous poll \u2013 and which is only a reflection of the widespread irregularities across every part of the country. We all observed as thugs had a field day unleashing terror on demographically profiled voters, which led to the suppressed turnout that has been recorded.\u201d\nIn 2015, Buhari\u2019s predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, called his opponent within hours to congratulate him, a rare occurrence in the country\u2019s intricate and dramatic politics, but Atiku insists he will not go down the same route.\n\u201cIf I had lost in a free and fair election, I would have called the victor within seconds of my being aware of his victory to offer not just my congratulations, but my services to help unite Nigeria by being a bridge between the north and the south,\u201d he said in a statement released on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cIn 2019, it is sad to see those who trampled on democracy thumping down their noses on the Nigerian people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow democracy to be emasculated. I hope and pray Nigerians will someday summon the courage to defend democracy.\u201d\nIf Atiku\u2019s legal challenge is successful, he will be the first person to upturn a presidential poll in the country. His deputy, Peter Obi, was the first person to get a gubernatorial election upturned.\nBuhari, who became president on his fourth try in 2015, lost all of his cases at the supreme court after his previous three attempts at the presidency in 2003, 2007 and 2011.",

        "content": "The Royal Academy\u2019s major exhibition of nudes features equal numbers of naked men and women. Is this progress?\nThings look different after #MeToo. And not just after #MeToo, but after several years of a surging fourth wave of feminism. There has been fury against patriarchy \u2013 with the term itself, after decades of dormancy, surging back into use to explain everything from the rise of Donald Trump to sexual violence in India to pay inequality in western Europe.\nEverywhere, dams of silence and fear are bursting, as women speak out about wrongs committed by men whose powerful positions once rendered them unassailable. Women have also rewritten the private stories they have told themselves (or buried) about their lives, from family relationships to workplace troubles to sexual encounters. In this atmosphere of revisionism, new stories have been needed. Kristen Roupenian\u2019s Cat Person, published at the end of 2017 in the New Yorker, owed its viral success to a wave of recognition from female readers. It told a story about dating and sex that seemed intensely true but, till then, barely told.\nThis new feminism has also affected the way people look. Museums and galleries \u2013 especially those representing a canonical European art tradition \u2013 burst with images of women disrobed and displayed for the delectation of men. Of course, there is nothing new about recognising the extent to which the spectacularisation of the female body has been part of a structure of oppression of women by men. The \u201cmale gaze\u201d has been discussed by feminist critics for decades. It became part of popular culture when John Berger\u2019s groundbreaking TV series Ways of Seeing invited a group of women to sit around a coffee table with cigarettes and glasses of wine to discuss the portrayal of the female body in art. \u201cMen look at women; women watch themselves being looked at,\u201d Berger intones gloomily at the start of the episode.\nNevertheless, in the last few years, the borderlines of acceptable looking have become blurred. In 2017, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York received a petition to remove Balthus\u2019s Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming, a painting of a young girl reclining on a chair, one leg up on a stool to reveal her underwear. In Britain, John William Waterhouse\u2019s Hylas and the Nymphs \u2013 which shows the seduction of Heracles\u2019s lover by bare-breasted water nymphs \u2013 was temporarily taken down from Manchester Art Gallery, in a move that was at the time widely regarded as censorship (wrongly, the museum argued).\nOther reassessments of works made in the past include the \u201cRhodes must fall\u201d campaign to remove statues of arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes from the universities of Oxford and Cape Town, as well as the recently announced move by Notre Dame University in Indiana to cover its 1880s murals depicting stereotypical images of Native Americans.\nLast autumn, there was a flurry of a different kind, as the Royal Academy of Arts in London announced a new exhibition: The Renaissance Nude, an 80-work examination of the naked body in European art of the 15th and 16th centuries. The show was greeted as a post-#MeToo event, since it is to feature broadly equal numbers of male and female bodies. There was even talk of a \u201cmakeshift gender quota\u201d.\nThe curators have been quick to refute this: it has nothing to do with #MeToo, they say, having been in the planning for many years. OCurator Per Rumberg told me that the broad equality of numbers was simply a reflection of the period: during the 15th century, the male body was scrutinised and portrayed just as much as the female form.\nThe exhibition might be seen as an attempt to complicate rather than simplify the story of representations of the naked body. Concentrating on a narrow, if culturally dominant, slice of art history, it looks at work from Italy, Germany, France and the Low Countries created during the long 15th century, just before the depiction of the naked body became the fundamental mark of an artist\u2019s prowess \u2013 before Michelangelo covered the walls of the pope\u2019s chapel in naked men (only for the genitals to be overpainted several decades later); and before Titian and Giorgione set the fashion for reclining female nudes, emulated down the centuries by artists from Vel\u00e1zquez to Picasso.\nWhat radiates from all this is the sheer variety of reasons for portraying the human body naked, and the complexity of the visual traditions artists were drawing on. The dominance of the nude in the Renaissance, the exhibition argues, cannot entirely be ascribed to the rediscovery of the art of classical antiquity. Attitudes to the human body were just as complex, various and messy in the 15th century as they are now, and much more localised \u2013 with Germany and Italy, say, working within different moral and rhetorical traditions.\nThe naked body might be, for example, a locus of scholarly humanist enquiry, its depiction requiring a mastery of anatomy and an examination of real naked models. Studies by Leonardo of the shoulder and neck will make the point in the RA show, as do D\u00fcrer\u2019s remarkable self-portraits, illustrated in the catalogue, in which his face and genitals are drawn with loving care.\nThere are the private, solitary pleasures implied by the act of looking at books of hours \u2013 tiny, exquisitely decorated volumes popular at the medieval French courts. In such books, the bathing Bathsheba is a popular subject, and her naked limbs \u2013 to the male commissioner of such a volume \u2013 might deliver both a frisson of desire and a warning against the dangers of female sexual power.\nThere is the reminder of mortal frailty implied in an extraordinary elmwood carving, from Ulm in Germany, of an elderly woman, who echoes the pose of classical sculptures of Venus, her hands across her genitals. The work is now known as Elderly Bather but, in a weird foreshadowing of Trump\u2019s famous taunt of Hillary Clinton, was traditionally called Nasty Old Woman \u2013 though, as with all such Old Master titles, it was not given by its maker, but became attached to it later.\nScholar Jill Burke speculates that some depictions of male nakedness, such as Pollaiuolo\u2019s famous large-scale Battle of the Nudes, may owe as much to Europeans\u2019 encounters with the \u201cbarbarous\u201d people of sub-Saharan Africa as to the more obvious example of Roman sarcophagi, which were frequently decorated with battle scenes in the second century AD.\nAs for the male body, most frequently it is Christ\u2019s, of course, his skin and bones and muscle and torn flesh a reminder of his humanity and, very occasionally, of his mortal sensuality. Hans Baldung\u2019s startling drawing The Ecstatic Christ sees him writhing on the ground, his left hand reaching beneath his loin cloth.\nThe exhibition will contain several depictions of Saint Sebastian, the iconoclastic martyr who was, according to Christian legend, tied up and shot with arrows. It is hard not to see some of these depictions as tinged with sensuality even when they are ostensibly devotional: Cima da Conegliano\u2019s portrayal has the skimpily loin-clothed saint gazing soulfully into the middle distance, a single arrow piercing his thigh, his flesh otherwise creamy and unblemished.\nThe book Seen from Behind, Patricia Lee Rubin\u2019s survey of the male bum in Renaissance art, is a revealing reminder of the complexities of past sexuality. Rubin notes that more than half the male population of Florence had what we would now call homosexual experiences at one time or another during this period. And one image of Saint Sebastian, according to the biographer Giorgio Vasari, was removed from a church for provoking \u201clight and evil thoughts\u201d among female parishioners.\nIn her forthcoming book The Italian Renaissance Nude, Jill Burke argues that because of the nude\u2019s dominance in European art history, it has come to seem somehow natural, inevitable and universal. Some critics, such as Kenneth Clark, even regarded it as a great summation of human creative endeavour. Burke, who worked on the exhibition, argues that we might in fact see the dominance of the nude as strange: non-European artistic traditions, such as those of China and Japan, never developed a taste for the naked body in the same way.\nIt seems especially important, just now, not to remove nudes from walls, but to look critically, and to resist the universalising power of the familiar. Those sensuous reclining nudes of Titian \u2013 his gorgeous Dana\u00ebs, raped by golden coins, his drowsing woodland nymphs, his Venuses \u2013 have an important precursor: a woodcut in an exquisitely decorated book, printed by the Venetian Aldine Press in the late 15th century. Called the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, it shows a female figure, naked and recumbent. Over her looms a satyr \u2013 half goat, half man \u2013 his penis erect. The satyr disappears from the many subsequent depictions of similar sleeping, vulnerable women. But you could say he has never gone away.\n The Renaissance Nude is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, 3 March to 2 June.",

        "content": "At least Brendan Rodgers is consistent. On exiting Celtic, thereby causing uproar among an element of the club\u2019s support, the 46-year-old managed to retain sentiment from his arrival in Glasgow in May 2016. And with a straight face, at that.\n\u201cFrom the moment I walked into Celtic Park I have been living my dream and, together with the players, staff and supporters, we have been on an amazing journey, which I will never forget,\u201d Rodgers said.\nWhether any manager would opt to end a \u201cdream\u201d 14 games from a third clean sweep of domestic trophies is open to debate. In part, this points to a theme obvious from last season onwards; glory in Scotland was not enough to hold the attention of Rodgers, not least when a return to the Premier League became a viable option. Leicester\u2019s interest in the former Liverpool manager had lasted for months.\nIn Scotland, there has already been an underplaying of how decent a job Rodgers has walked \u2013 or run \u2013 into. It had been obvious he could not swap Celtic for anything higher up the Premier League ladder. Leicester were a perfect fit.\nThat Rodgers placed such stock in Celtic being \u201chis\u201d club means the upset felt by the Scottish champions\u2019 fans is understandable. It also undermines the hero worship afforded to Rodgers, plus the flawed sense that Celtic\u2019s pursuit of 10 titles in succession has a wider resonance than even their own executive believes. The reality is that those in far more competitive environments in Scotland shrug shoulders at recurring success by the biggest club there. Rodgers, whose biggest pre-Celtic achievement was play-off success with Swansea in 2011, absolutely revelled in the adulation and delivery of seven trophies.\nHis talent will have been enhanced by presiding over a club where the demand to win every game far outstrips that of Leicester, just as managing a team who commonly enjoy vast chunks of possession brings its own distinct challenges. And believe it or not; it is possible to be a poor manager of Celtic; see Tony Mowbray.\nThat Rodgers implemented a relentless approach to domestic football is beyond dispute. That he oversaw the development of talent \u2013 Callum McGregor, James Forrest, Kieran Tierney and Ryan Christie the most obvious examples \u2013 represents his key Celtic success. Early this season, with Celtic struggling, Rodgers called a meeting during which he asked players to anonymously list key thoughts regarding every one of their teammates.\nEach individual was later issued with the detail as applicable to them; Celtic\u2019s form was to improve, in what provides a nod towards Rodgers\u2019 management skill. Believe it or not, it was not always all about him.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\nA deeper story had played out by then. Rodgers\u2019 disquiet with the Celtic board regarding what he viewed as the failure to adequately back him in the summer transfer window disrupted relationships to a point from which they could never fully recover. Dermot Desmond, Celtic\u2019s key shareholder, places such faith in the chief executive, Peter Lawwell, that Rodgers had no scope to win the battle, never mind a war.\nIn reply to Rodgers\u2019 unrest, his paymasters could readily point towards a string of poor forays into the transfer market as costing Celtic millions. During Rodgers\u2019 tenure, Celtic\u2019s staff costs rocketed to close to \u00a360m per year; 30 times some of their domestic opponents. It would be no shock to see that spending curtailed now. Lee Congerton, hired and vehemently defended by Rodgers, has presided over an inauspicious recruitment run.\nA fiscal gulf \u2013 no fault of Celtic\u2019s, of course \u2013 did not halt wild celebration as Scottish success continued. Rodgers rather enjoyed being the big fish in a small pond, where he would not think twice of offering advice to other clubs or delivering powerpoint presentations to out-of-work coaches. Yet there had been sufficient indication, even a year ago, that the Scottish scene \u2013 which Rodgers began to refer to as \u201cup here\u201d \u2013 was not stimulating enough for a manager who regards himself as being in the top tier.\nAgainst this backdrop, Rodgers\u2019 failure to make proper inroads in European competition was strange. It also undermined what he could produce against Hamilton or St Johnstone, where annual wage bills equated to Rodgers\u2019 own salary. From 22 European ties \u201cproper\u201d, Rodgers mustered only five wins. Whereas Neil Lennon and Gordon Strachan \u2013 twice \u2013 took Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League, Rodgers found himself generally helpless against serious opposition.\nA myth soon developed in respect of this \u2013 happily enhanced by Rodgers \u2013 whereby his dreamy, free-flowing football came at the cost of effective pragmatism. In truth, this Celtic team continually conceded dreadful goals in Europe, a scenario not intrinsically linked to systems or style of play at all. They did not attack with vigour. Defeat to AEK Athens at the qualifying phase of this season\u2019s Champions League represented a dire result; the Greeks did not take a point from subsequent group games.\nIn almost three years, Rodgers did not source a formidable central defensive pairing for Celtic, as will require attention this summer. His beholding to Scott Brown was routinely exposed outside Scotland\u2019s goldfish bowl. A failure to properly trust in Celtic\u2019s academy players, the best in Scotland by a distance, meant an over-reliance on expensive loan deals.\nRodgers has points to prove back in the Premier League. That is partly on account of the wounding circumstances by whichhe left Liverpool but also, whisper it, owing to shortcomings illustrated in Glasgow. Rodgers was very good for Celtic but it would be an error to deny the reverse is also true. The club have no serious cause to mourn his loss.",

Shares rose 3% making it one of the top risers on the FTSE 100.\nPete Redfern, chief executive, said the firm had yet to see any sign of a Brexit-related slowdown in demand.\n\u201cDespite ongoing macroeconomic and political uncertainty, we have made a very positive start to 2019 and are encouraged to see continued strong demand for our homes.\u201d\nHe added that while it would be \u201cnaive not to be concerned\u201d and aware of the risks in the short term, there was a \u201clarge underlying demand\u201d for housing in the UK which would not be affected by Brexit in the long term.\nThe strong results came a day after rival Persimmon reported a \u00a31.09bn profit for last year, the biggest ever made by a UK housebuilder. For every home sold, Persimmon made a profit of \u00a366,265, compared with \u00a353,073 at Taylor Wimpey.\nHousebuilders have profited hugely over the past five years from the taxpayer funded help-to buy-scheme, which allows buyers to put down a deposit of as little as 5% on a new build home, while the government lends the buyer up to 20% of the value of the property (40% in London), interest free for the first five years.\nMore than a third of the homes sold by Taylor Wimpey last year were through the scheme, at 36%, although this was less than the 43% in 2017. The average price of a private home sold by the company was \u00a3302,000 \u2013 up 2% \u2013 while the overall average selling price, including social housing, was flat at \u00a3264,000.\nTaylor Wimpey\u2019s profits have trebled since the beginning of help-to-buy in 2013. It defended use of the scheme, noting that 77% of sales made through it were to first-time-buyers.\nGreg Beales, campaign director at Shelter, said: \u201cTaylor Wimpey joins Persimmon as the next developer making massive profits funded by taxpayer cash whilst doing very little to address the housing crisis in this country.\u201d\nThe help-to-buy scheme is due to end in 2023 and from 2021 will only be open to first-time buyers.\nRedfern said the firm had never lobbied for the scheme to be extended and acknowledged that \u201cin some ways it has gone on too long\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tool the government can use at the low point in the production cycle but is not there to boost the upper years of the cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeally it would have been introduced two years earlier than it was and it would have been tapered off earlier.\u201d\nTaylor Wimpey handed shareholders nearly \u00a3500m in dividends, up from \u00a3450m in 2017. It is a big turnaround for a business that had to tap shareholders for \u00a3533m in cash following a \u00a32.5bn rescue debt refinancing in 2009.\nThe company was at the centre of the recent ground rent scandal, with thousands of homebuyers trapped in contracts with spiralling ground rents. The firm set aside \u00a3130m in 2017 of which \u00a325.5m has been paid so far to freeholders to move leaseholders with a 10-year doubling lease to an RPI-based structure.\nRedfern said about half of homeowners would be switched to less onerous ground rent terms this year and the pace had picked up.\nLast year, Taylor Wimpey took a charge of \u00a346.1m \u2013 of which \u00a330m was related to the removal of unsafe cladding on a \u201csmall number\u201d of buildings following the Grenfell Tower fire. A further \u00a316.1m covered an increase in pension liabilities following last October\u2019s high court ruling on the equalisation of guaranteed minimum pensions for men and women in UK defined benefit pension plans.",

Egyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems and poorly maintained railway lines.\nRailway officials said the single railcar was travelling too fast when it collided head-on with the barrier. At least 47 people were injured, many of whom suffered severe burns and are now in critical condition.\nThe explosion and fire blasted through people on the platform in the busy Ramses station in downtown Cairo. A surveillance video shared by local media showed the moment of impact when the car barrelled past people who were then engulfed in flames and smoke.\nAmbulances rushed to the scene and firefighters struggled to get the flames under control. Video from surveillance cameras showed flames ravaging the station\u2019s interior.\nAshraf Momtaz, a general railway inspector, told the Associated Press that there were several explanations for what happened, one of which was that the train was accelerated to a high speed by someone who then jumped.\nIt was not immediately clear if the engine had a driver at the time of the crash, Momtaz said. \u201cThe railcar takes time to [gather] speed so there is a chance that someone set it on full speed before leaving,\u201d he said, adding that investigators were considering all scenarios.\n\u201cThere are records that show which driver is in which railcar,\u201d he said. In general, he said, the accident suggested \u201cnegligence from the driver and supervisors.\u201d\nMadbouly, who was quick to visit the site, promised a tough response. He said: \u201cAny person found to be negligent will be held accountable and it will be severe.\u201d Officials often blame the rail network\u2019s poor maintenance on decades of negligence and a lack of funds.\nHours later the cabinet announced that the prime minister had accepted the resignation of Arafat.\nEgypt\u2019s general prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, ordered an extensive investigation and sent a team of investigators to the station.\nThe Ramses district is among the busiest and most crowded areas of the Egyptian capital. The state railway agency briefly halted all train traffic and ordered the evacuation of the station.The accident triggered adebate among Egyptians, many of whom blamed the government for not improving railway services even after a series of deadly accidents. Several noted previous statements by Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, expressing reservations about spending too much money on improving trains, citing a lack of funds.\nEgypt\u2019s railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and poor management with official figures showing 1,793 train accidents in 2017.\nIn July 2018, a passenger train derailed near the southern city of Aswan, injuring at least six people and prompting authorities to fire the chief of the country\u2019s railways.\nIn March last year, the president said the government lacked about 250bn Egyptian pounds (\u00a310.7bn) to overhaul the rundown rail system.

        "content": "The composer of Three Letters to Sarajevo discusses religious and Gypsy inspirations, the power of communist rock \u2013 and why he\u2019d like to move to Manchester\nGoran Bregovi\u0107 sits in a French hotel lobby considering the battered history of Sarajevo, once his childhood home and later the scene of the most lengthy, brutal siege in modern European history. Hundreds of thousands were trapped, and more than 10,000 died, as Bosnian Serb forces encircled the city between 1992 and 1996 in the violent upheavals that marked the collapse of the former Yugoslavia. But life had once been very different there, Bregovi\u0107 says, back in the era of communism and President Tito.\n\u201cWe were a little bit poor, but if you look back, this was probably the best time in our history. It was a peaceful time. My mum was Serbian, my dad was Croatian, and the only problem in our house was my father\u2019s drinking \u2026 He was a Yugoslav army colonel and they drink too much.\u201d\nBregovi\u0107 has had a colourful history. He was a major rock star in the former Yugoslavia, then went on to write award-winning film scores, compose for orchestras and become a bestselling exponent of Balkan Gypsy brass music \u2013 although he is not a Gypsy. He has sold more than six million albums, and collaborated with everyone from Iggy Pop to Scott Walker to the late Rachid Taha. He describes himself as an \u201cold-fashioned guy who doesn\u2019t make videos or appear on TV but presents his music by travelling around\u201d on a never-ending global tour. I offer the inevitable comparison with Bob Dylan. \u201cI love that.\u201d\nHe grew up \u201csurrounded\u201d by the music of the Christians, Jews and Muslims who co-existed in the city, and it\u2019s this era and those influences that are celebrated in his work Three Letters from Sarajevo. The Bosnian capital, he argues, is \u201ca metaphor for our time. What we saw in Sarajevo after 1991, we now see all around the world. Today we are good neighbours \u2013 and then tomorrow we are shooting at each other because we are from different religions. Human beings are conditioned machines. If you condition them well they are good; if you condition them badly they can be really bad.\u201d\nTonight he\u2019s in Rennes, where Three Letters from Sarajevo is performed by the brass, percussion and singers of his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra, joined by the Brittany Symphony Orchestra. The show starts with a culture clash as the orchestra play a theme and are answered by five Gypsy brass players and a drummer who come marching through the audience. Bregovi\u0107 walks on like a rock star \u2013 white suit, tousled hair \u2013 and sits on the edge of the orchestra clutching an electric guitar, but the key soloists are three impressive violinists from different cultures.\nThis is a work dominated by three mostly instrumental passages \u2013 Jewish Letter, Muslim Letter and Christian Letter \u2013 and each features a different soloist, with Gershon Leizerson from Israel followed by Zied Zouari from Tunisia and Mirjana Neskovic from Serbia. The finale features the singalong In the Death Car, with Bregovi\u0107 taking the lead, half-speaking his way through vocals originally tackled by Iggy Pop.\nIt\u2019s a fusion that has its roots back in Sarajevo. Bregovi\u0107\u2019s military father was an amateur violin player and wanted his son to do the same, \u201cso I took violin lessons at a young age \u2026 but I\u2019m really more of a guitar sort of guy. I taught myself to play. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m educated in music\u201d. At 17 he was playing guitar in striptease bars in Dubrovnik, but when he began playing in bars in Italy, \u201cI had problems with drugs. My mum came to pick me up and I promised I wouldn\u2019t play any more.\u201d\nFor four years he followed her advice, and studied philosophy at Sarajevo University, a move that should have led to him becoming a teacher of Marxism. Instead, he dramatically changed direction. \u201cI didn\u2019t take the final exams, which saved me from that destiny. Instead I became a rock star \u2013 and I was the biggest. My heroes were British rock stars like Led Zeppelin; if you play guitar you want to be like the other good-looking guitarists, like Jimmy Page.\u201d\nHis band were called Bijelo Dugme (White Button), \u201cbecause I had a song with the lyrics, \u2018If I were a white button I\u2019d be next to you, and you didn\u2019t know that I could touch you\u2019\u201d. After releasing their first album in 1974 they shook up the Yugoslav music scene with their mixture of hard rock, folk and Gypsy influences \u2013 with Gypsies helping them to get fired up before going on stage. \u201cWhen I was a big rock star there was always a Gypsy brass band playing for us in our dressing room \u2013 this is what brings madness! I always think that Balkan brass music is like punk at the beginning. More madness than music.\u201d He continues musing on punk. \u201cIt died with God Save the Queen, because this was really well done, well produced. That was the end of punk, when it started to be music.\u201d\nSo what was special about White Button? \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll on the communist side was much more important than rock\u2019n\u2019roll in the west,\u201d he claims. \u201cIf you were careful and not stupid, you could leave messages that were important at the time.\u201d Such as? \u201cToday it may seem childish, but it seemed important at one stage that my singer was dressed in a white general\u2019s uniform, like Tito, and then in black like a cop in a Nazi concentration camp.\u201d He said this was \u201can obvious allegory about communism and national socialist regimes\u201d, adding \u201cyou try make young people think a little differently\u201d.\nSo what does he think of Tito now? \u201cHe did a lot of good things but missed the chance to transform Yugoslavia into a democratic state. He could have done it and war would have been avoided.\u201d As war approached, White Button recorded banned nationalist songs, \u201cone Croat and one Serbian, together in one song, and used forbidden nationalists on the record \u2026 so of course my manager was jailed\u201d. His lyrics somewhat optimistically suggested \u201cwhen the war starts you and I will close the windows and kiss each other until it is over\u201d.\nBut by the time Sarajevo came under siege, Bregovi\u0107 had broken up the band and was living in Paris. \u201cI was rich and famous, but when the war started I lost everything \u2013 all my cars, ships, houses back in Sarajevo. I had to work for the first time \u2013 because until then I had been paid for things I would happily have done for free.\u201d He wasn\u2019t exactly at a loose end. In 1988 the Serbian film director Emir Kusturica had asked him to write the score for the acclaimed Time of the Gypsies, and more collaborations followed. \u201cEven in England I did one with Ewan MacGregor [1997\u2019s The Serpent\u2019s Kiss]. But then I stopped. I had strong feelings that I was wasting my time.\u201d\nSo he assembled the Wedding and Funeral Orchestra and went back on the road. He has toured almost non-stop for over 20 years now, with \u201c120 shows last year \u2013 sometimes more\u201d. In the process he has become the world\u2019s best-known exponent of Balkan Gypsy music. What does he say to criticism of him using the tradition as a non-Gypsy? \u201cI\u2019m not the only composer to have been impressed and influenced by Gypsies \u2026 and what is the point of a tradition if we can\u2019t take things from it? One of the things I\u2019m proudest of is that today is a Friday, and hundreds of Gypsy bands will be playing for tips, and they will play a lot of my songs. I like the idea that because of that, some kid will have marmalade on his bread.\u201d\nFor his next project, he\u2019s planning a follow up to his 2007 opera Karmen With a Happy End, but this time based on immigrant stories and set in Manchester \u201cbecause I am told it has more different populations than anywhere in Europe\u201d. He says he\u2019s looking forward to living there for a few months. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a big fan of Manchester United.\u201d\nA French music executive travelling with him looks bemused: \u201cWhen is he going to do that? After France he\u2019s going to Siberia, then he\u2019s in London.\u201d He shows me the packed schedule for this year, which includes Europe, North America, Mexico and \u2013 of course \u2013 concerts back in Sarajevo.\n\u201cI pay my taxes in Sarajevo; I\u2019m a local composer so I need to be there,\u201d Bregovi\u0107 says. \u201cBut the city has changed.\u201d He laments how the city has lost its pre-Bosnian war spirit, when various Balkan ethnicities, be they Muslim or Christian, all lived alongside one another. \u201cIt was a primitive war, with primitive results, and it will take time to come back. But I love Sarajevo.\u201d\n Goran Bregovi\u0107 is at the Royal Festival Hall, London on Friday 1 March. Three Letters from Sarajevo is out on Wrasse Records.",

The flames were over two metres high at one point and came within 500 metres of a critical A-road, as well as three buildings.\nA dramatic picture from the ferocious moorland fire at #MarsdenMoor last night.

The quick initial fire attack by firefighters did help to bring the fire under control, despite the size and ferocity of the flames.\u201d\nPublic Health England advised local residents to stay indoors and to keep doors and windows closed to prevent smoke inhalation.\nSue Hayman,the shadow environment secretary, said the fire was \u201cdevastating\u201d and must serve as a \u201cdramatic wake-up call to act\u201d on climate change.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and for preventing and managing wildfires are failing, and the consequences are there for all to see,\u201d she said. \u201cLabour will rapidly reduce emissions through our green jobs revolution, and protect our moorlands by restoring upland peat habitats.\u201d\nClimate scientists said it was difficult to attribute single events to climate change but that the frequency of wildfires would increase as the weather gradually became warmer.\nDr Thomas Smith, an assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics, said managed moorland fires were \u201cquite normal\u201d in February but that the Saddleworth Moor fire had clearly got out of control.\n\u201cThe fires are occurring due to favourable weather conditions. It is not possible to attribute this short spell of warm, dry weather to climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, these warm spells will become more likely with climate change, and so we should expect fire activity like we\u2019ve seen this week to happen more frequently in future.\u201d",

Security staff had previously attempted to remove the protesters.\nAs one protester was led to a police van, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve been a very law-abiding citizen all my life but I realise now that is not really working. I am a mother of two girls and I am really terrified about their future.

Officers attended and discovered a number of people had glued themselves to windows. Nine people have been arrested on suspicion of offences including aggravated trespass and criminal damage.\u201d\nThe protest came halfway through International Petroleum Week, an event organised by the Energy Institute to bring together global energy experts and to manage \u201ctension between sustainability demands and operational, business return\u201d.\nExtinction Rebellion said oil and gas operators and investors should respond seriously to the climate crisis rather than meet to form new partnerships and discuss expansion.\nSam Knights, an activist with the group, said: \u201cThese companies are destroying our planet. We have to start talking about that. We have to start pointing out, again and again, that their business model is based on the mass murder of hundreds and millions of people. They know this.\n\u201cIn fact, they have known this for a very long time. But they refuse to change. They continue to put private profit over human life. The fact that they are still talking about acquiring new fossil fuel reserves at this point in the climate crisis is not only deeply immoral, it is evidently criminal. We all have a moral duty to stop them.\u201d\nThe conference heard a speech from the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who entered the venue through a side entrance.\nThe Guardian asked the Department for International Trade for a copy of the speech and initially received extracts in which Fox declared that the UK government \u201cwill not use Brexit to lower environmental standards\u201d, before being given the full document.\nHe highlighted the importance of the oil and gas sector to the UK and restated the country\u2019s commitment under the Climate Change Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050.\nDiscussion topics at the conference on Wednesday included \u201cunlocking opportunities on [Africa\u2019s] next hotspots\u201d, adapting to \u201cclimate change impacts that are now unavoidable\u201d and exploration of a number of new oil prospects.\nOutside the hotel, attendees said they sympathised with the protesters. \u201cWe all do, as human beings,\u201d one said. \u201cHowever, we do different things to reach the same goal, a better world.\u201d\nExtinction Rebellion, which last November blockaded five bridges in central London, said it would continue to embark on a \u201ccampaign of rebellion\u201d to highlight what it said was the criminal inaction of the UK government on climate change.\nIt said a series of events were planned in the run-up to an \u201cinternational climate rebellion\u201d planned for 15 April, in which it says thousands of activists will gather in London. Similar events are planned by Extinction Rebellion groups in 30 other countries.\n\u201cWhile politicians rearrange the Brexit deckchairs, the British people are heading for extinction due to the ecological emergency,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe rich and powerful who run this country continue to refuse to do their duty to protect us from disaster \u2026 that is why we have to rebel.\u201d",

It has offered to pay for the return of the belongings and apologised for her treatment.\nThe Labour MP Jess Phillips, a member of the influential women and equalities select committee, described the case as appalling and inhumane.\n\u201cThis is just another case where cutbacks in police funding are being laid at the door of the most vulnerable,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhen the police can\u2019t afford to do quite a basic and routine thing like send things in the post, it has a human consequence \u2013 in this case, that an alleged rape victim could have been left out of pocket for doing the right thing,\u201d she said.\nLast year, analysis by the Guardian showed that less than a third of young men are convicted on rape charges, while other research suggests most rapes are not reported, and that less than half of cases taken to court end in conviction.\nThe woman said she spoke out about her ordeal because it might help future complainants who were in a worse position than her.\nHowever, she said, it had dragged out the episode, which happened in September, and the apology was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d.\nShe said she now understood why so few women reported rape.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had complete faith in the police. After this, if anything was to ever happen to me again, I would never, ever report it,\u201d she said.\nA GMP spokesperson said: \u201cGMP does not have a policy in place whereby victims of rape are charged to have their items returned to them.\n\u201cIn line with current policy, items are safely returned to the victim at their request. Any costs incurred are paid for by GMP where applicable. It is not force policy to use courier services for this. However, victims are able to arrange their own courier and the costs would be met by themselves.\u201d\nThey said an officer had spoken to the woman about the issue.\n\u201cWe hope this does not affect people\u2019s confidence in our commitment to handling these types of offences and we are dedicated to ensuring this never happens again.\u201d",

Shareholders would be left with just 5% of the company. They would have the right to buy new shares back from the lenders, but only up to 33.3%.\nInterserve\u00a0has a vast number of public sector contracts in the UK in areas such as school meals, hospital cleaning and probation services. It has also worked on road projects on the M5, maintains some of Britain\u2019s busiest railway stations, and cleans more than 2,000 London Underground carriages every evening.\nInterserve in numbers\n45,000 Number of UK employees\n700 The number of schools where it provides catering services\n40,000 The number of medium- to low-risk offenders on probation that Interserve supervises\n150\u00a0The number of BBC sites, including Salford Media City, where Interserve provides total facilities management\n\u00a3227m The value of a five year contract for providing office management, catering and waste disposal at 700 DWP sites across the UK\nA63 The new footbridge crossing the road at Princes Quay in Hull, used by 45,000 people a day, is one of many construction projects Interserve is running across the UK\n\u00a325m Interserve\u2019s part of a contract to redevelop the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr\n600,000 The number of visitors to Edinburgh Zoo, where Interserve does the cleaning, security, park presentation, waste disposal and washroom services.\n\u00a3250m The sum paid by Interserve to buy Initial Facilities from Rentokil Initial in 2014, adding more than 25,000 new employees to the group.\n51 The number of years that Interserve will hold the concession to build and run two new colleges at Durham University\n\nThe lenders, which include hedge funds and banks, would also provide a \u00a3110m new debt facility that comes due in 2022, at interest rates understood to be a third of those attached to the company\u2019s existing loans.\nEY has been lined up to manage a pre-pack administration if the lenders lose the vote, which requires approval from investors holding 50% of the company to pass.\nColtrane and fellow shareholder Farringdon are thought to wield enough voting power between them to thwart the plan.\nA source close to Coltrane, which has put forward alternative proposals based on a share issue that it has offered to guarantee, indicated that the US hedge fund was unlikely to accept Interserve\u2019s latest plan.\nColtrane is understood to have appointed legal advisers to consider a lawsuit against the company and the lenders, should the firm collapse into administration.\nColtrane has also been angered by Interserve\u2019s admission that it will have spent \u00a376m on advice for its financial restructuring plans and the fact that directors have said they would not invest any of their own money buying the new shares.\n\u201c[The directors] are recommending a deal on which they personally are not taking up their rights. This is very rare and shows the plan is terrible.\u201d\n\u201cThe truth is out \u2013 this is all about creditors holding a gun to the company\u2019s head with management itself not taking part.\u201d\nChief executive Debbie White declined to say why she and fellow directors were not prepared to take up their rights to buy new shares with their own money.\nShe insisted that the company\u2019s underlying performance was robust and said she would be seeking to convince shareholders including Coltrane that the debt-cutting plan was the best option for the business.\nOn Friday, Coltrane submitted a counter-proposal that would see lenders share more of the pain of the financial restructuring with shareholders.\nColtrane\u2019s plan would give only 65% of the company to creditors in exchange for \u00a3436m of debt, leaving shareholders with an improved 10% of the equity, plus the opportunity to participate in a 25% rights issue worth \u00a375m. Coltrane would underwrite the rights issue.\nThe hedge fund is considering adjusting the proposal in the light of Interserve\u2019s full-year results, which were issued alongside details of the debt-cutting plan. The results showed that Interserve has slashed its pretax losses from \u00a3244m to \u00a3111m. However, net debt has continued to rise, reaching \u00a3632m.\nInterserve\u2019s largest customer is the government. The Cabinet Office, which oversees public sector contracts, is understood to be supportive of the rescue plan.",

        "content": "Drill artists argue their lyrics reflect truth but courts accuse them of inciting violence\nLawyers, musicians, prison staff and human rights activists have called for an end to the harsh treatment of drill musicians by the criminal justice system.\nDrill is a genre of rap that originated on Chicago\u2019s south side almost a decade ago. Popular in south London since 2017, it has a distinctive beat with lyrics often focused on the violence young people witness around them.\nBut while the artists say they are simply describing the world they live in, lawyers speaking at a special summit organised in support of drill artists have warned that courts are increasingly using controversial criminal behaviour orders (CBOs) against musicians whom they accuse of inciting violence with their lyrics.\nThat tactic sparked controversy last year when drill artists Skengdo and AM were subjected to CBOs. In June 2018 London drill crew 1011 were also issued with one of these orders.\nWhile inciting violence is a crime, the lawyers warned that the criminal justice system is blurring the line between those who are exercising freedom of expression and their creative talents to commentate on what they see all around them and those who are demonstrably inciting violence.\nAlex Taylor-Camara, a criminal defence barrister at Garden Court chambers who represents many drill musicians charged with violence-related offences, said: \u201cWe are seeing the increasing use of these CBOs. It\u2019s a clampdown on a certain type of music. Once you tell people they can\u2019t associate with certain people or play a certain kind of music, you\u2019re on a very slippery slope.\u201d\nTaylor-Camara said that in his experience during these court cases many of those in the court did not even understand what drill musicians were rapping about and needed it to be explained to them.\nThe call to curtail the use of these orders came at an event on Tuesday night organised by MTC solicitors and Goldsmiths University Bricks, a group of BME students who organise arts, poetry, music and open mic events. A panel of lawyers, drill artists and a prison officer said the criminal justice system is unfairly discriminating against drill musicians.\nEarlier this month 65 individuals and organisations including human rights activists, lawyers and musicians wrote to the Guardian to protest about the use of CBOs, also known as gang injunctions, by the Metropolitan police.\nLast May YouTube deleted dozens of drill music videos at the request of Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, after she claimed their videos were inciting violence.\nTaylor-Camara expressed concern about prosecutions over drill lyrics when it was not clear who the authors of the lyrics were.\n\u201cSometimes there is a mishmash of different people involved. People have chosen to rap about the realities of their lives.\u201d\nHe insisted that not all drill music was negative with crews like Hope Dealers offering a mix of \u2018balaclavas and bibles\u2019.\nRapper Drill Minister said that drill music was a reflection of society as it exists. \u201cPeople want the truth from music,\u201d he said.\nSolicitor Antonia Kim Charles of MTC solicitors said she and her colleagues will continue to challenge the increasing use of CBOs against drill musicians. She said courts needed to be satisfied that \u201charassment, alarm or distress\u201d had been caused or was likely to be caused before issuing these orders but that unlike some forms of anti-social behaviour, no one was forcing anyone else to listen to drill music.\nKwabz runs the music platform Mixtape Madness in Tottenham, north London. He urged the criminal justice system and wider society to look at the broader context before prosecuting drill artists. \u201cThe mainstream system is broken. Drill music is being used as a political scapegoat,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic has always been used in this way, going back to the time of slavery and railroad songs. Critics of drill music say that it\u2019s violent but for many young people there hasn\u2019t been a year in their lives when they haven\u2019t witnessed high levels of violence.\u201d\nEdmund Christie, a prison officer who runs Love The Beat Radio, said that drill music was often \u201ca cry for help\u201d from young people but there was rarely the support available that drill musicians needed.\nWhen asked about why drill musicians often wore balaclavas, Drill Minister joked: \u201cIt\u2019s because we want to hide from our mums.\u201d",

        "content": "Penhill became the latest big name to be ruled out of the Cheltenham Festival on Wednesday when Willie Mullins reported the horse to be \u201cvery sore\u201d one day after an important piece of work. Ironically, that news followed hard on the heels of the final set of entries being revealed, showing a record Irish-trained entry of 825 for Festival races, amounting to an unprecedented 45% of all entrants.\nIrish raiders are odds-on to win more races than the home defence at Cheltenham next month but Penhill will be unable to contribute as he has done for the last two seasons. The eight-year-old is notoriously fragile and has had only four races over the last two years, but two of them were victories at the Festival, in the Albert Bartlett of 2017 and the Stayers\u2019 Hurdle 12 months ago.\nMullins gave a clear warning of what could happen at his media day last week, when he reported Penhill on course for the Stayers\u2019 but added: \u201cEvery day with him, you\u2019re looking at him every morning to make sure that he\u2019s all right. So far, so good. But he\u2019s going to have a few more searching bits of work between now and Cheltenham.\u201d\nPenhill had been trading at 6-1 second-favourite in the markets for the Stayers\u2019. In his absence Paisley Park tightened to 2-1 favourite, while Samcro is next in the betting. It was the second upheaval in the Cheltenham betting in the space of three days, following Monday\u2019s news that Le Richebourg would miss the Arkle.\nThose two unfortunate absentees notwithstanding, the Irish raiding party looks sure to dominate the Festival in a fortnight\u2019s time, judging by the sheer quantity of entries made. This year\u2019s tally is 110 more than the previous record, set two years ago. A similar increase, if repeated next year, would give Ireland more than half of all Festival entries.\nIreland has won the Prestbury Cup, given to the country which fields most Festival winners, for the last three years and it is seven years since the award for top Festival trainer was last won by a trainer based in Britain. Those numbers represent a sea change since the late 1980s, when only Galmoy prevented Irish raiders being blanked for three years in a row.\n\u201cIt is tough,\u201d said the Oxfordshire-based trainer Charlie Longsdon, reflecting on how much harder British stables are now finding it to make a mark at the Festival. Referring to the ownership vehicle of Michael O\u2019Leary, he added: \u201cWe know how big Gigginstown is these days. Gordon Elliott\u2019s got 200 plus horses and Willie\u2019s got a lot.\n\u201cThey are fantastic trainers but it does make it harder to compete, there\u2019s no doubt. At the Grand National weights launch, Gordon was saying he wanted to run 10 or maybe more; well, that\u2019s a quarter of the bloody field!\u201d\nNigel Twiston-Davies was more sanguine about the increasing Irish influence in the best British races. \u201cObviously it\u2019s harder because they do very well. But it\u2019s good competition. It\u2019s good for the sport, good for everybody.\u201d\nAsked if it was now harder for British trainers to buy the best young horses, Twiston-Davies said: \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to buy them anyway. It\u2019s a problem if you\u2019ve got a lot of money but, since we\u2019ve never had that, we\u2019ll just carry on doing what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\nEddie O\u2019Leary, who runs Gigginstown, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good time at the Festival for the last few years but that probably means we won\u2019t do well this time.\u201d But O\u2019Leary is now, after years of discontent, satisfied that Irish runners are treated fairly when they race in British handicaps. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know the English handicapper\u2019s name and isn\u2019t that a good thing? Like a good referee, you don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s there.\u201d\nMeanwhile the French ruling body has announced that jockeys will be limited to five uses of the whip per race from March. The British Horseracing Authority, once more consulting on possible changes to its own whip rules, seems sure to take notice of the change.\nMusselburgh\u00a01.35 Constancio 2.10 Samtu 2.45 Boy's On Tour 3.20 Ballynanty 3.55 Benny's\u00a0Secret (nap) 4.30 Highate Hill\u00a0Ludlow\u00a01.50 Snapdragon Fire 2.25 Kayf Blanco 3.00 Earlofthecotswolds 3.35 Calipso\u00a0Collonges 4.10 It's O Kay 4.45 Now Ben 5.15 HijranTaunton\u00a02.00 Regulation 2.35 Airton 3.10 Oscar Ceremony 3.45 Bastien 4.20 Colonial\u00a0Dreams 4.55 Master Baker 5.30 New Guard\u00a0Newcastle\u00a04.05 Glan Y Gors 4.40 Almost Midnight 5.10 Winged Spur 5.45 Treasure Me\u00a0(nb) 6.15 Portledge 6.45 Fendale 7.15 Wise Words\u00a0Kempton\u00a04.50 Solveig's Song 5.20 Jack Louie 5.55 Cashel 6.30 Creek Island 7.00\u00a0Astrospeed 7.30 Valentino Dancer 8.00 Blazon 8.30 The Detainee",

        "content": "Move to evict protesters who have squatted site since 2010 comes days before judicial review of third runway plans\nBailiffs have moved in on a community of environmental protesters who have been camping near Heathrow for almost nine years, following an eviction order to remove the men and women occupying part of the land.\nThe community, Grow Heathrow, is one of the longest-lasting environmental protest camps in the UK. But on Tuesday bailiffs acting for the owner of part of the land evicted them from an area at the front of the camp. In response, environmental protesters dug into tunnels on Wednesday at a former garden centre near Heathrow and vowed to continue their fight against the third runway.\nThe eco-protesters, who have squatted on 30 acres of land around Sipson since 2010 to defy attempts to build another runway, had begun to restore the homes that were damaged in the eviction operation.. But on Wednesday specialist tunnel-clearance teams were brought in to try to clear protesters from a network of underground passages built by the community.\nAs high court enforcement officers guarded the main entrance to the Grow Heathrow land on Wednesday, a clash broke out between the protesters and bailiffs after the water supply to the site was turned off. Several protesters were wrestled to the ground by enforcement officers before one of the senior officials on site said they would restore the water.\n\u201cFeelings are running high,\u201d said one protester. \u201cThis is our home, it has been our home for nine years, and we are seeing part of it being trashed.\u201d\nA senior official for the bailiffs refused to comment.\nInside the remaining Grow Heathrow site, Liam, 21, who was among several people pulled off a platform by bailiffs as part of the eviction, said the community would continue to fight against the third runway: \u201cPeople here are committed to continuing to make a stand against the runway, there is no doubt of that. This place is unique because of its age. It is not just the protest, it is a way of showcasing different techniques and ways to live to help the local ecology and the local community.\u201d\nThe protesters first occupied the land, formerly a garden centre and then a junkyard, on 7 March 2010. Their eco squat has become a self-sustaining community, complete with polytunnels, beehives, compost toilets, showers, a communal garden and more than 15 houses built from materials reclaimed from the local area.\nSince the privately owned land was taken over, there have been a number of legal battles. The latest proceedings resulted in the attempted eviction from a part of the site this week. While it was originally sited in an area that was to become part of the third runway, a change of plans by the British Airports Authority means the land now abuts what would be the perimeter of the expanded airport.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to go away; Heathrow might think we are, but we are not,\u201d said Terry, a Grow Heathrow resident who has supported the squat for nine years. \u201cLiving here has taught me a lot. Living here is not easy: we scrimp, we get our food from bins, or we grow it ourselves, and we have created something on this land which was a scrapheap before. We are not going to give up this fight.\u201d\nJack Turlock, a resident of the eco-village, said: \u201cWe are completely committed to continuing support for the local community. Airport expansion will make their homes uninhabitable.\u201d\nIan Diamant was one of the locals who brought food to the Grow Heathrow \u201cvillagers\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cLots of people around here support them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still fighting and we want them here \u2013 we won\u2019t give up until there is one brick on another.\u201d\nAs they cleared up, the protesters asked for access to their belongings \u2013 but were not granted the right to gather them from the secured area of land. Inside were paints and banners ready for the community\u2019s ninth birthday party in a few days\u2019 time. \u201cWe are still going ahead. Everything is continuing as planned,\u201d said Terry.\nTwo days after the celebrations, on 10th March, Heathrow\u2019s third runway is set to face five legal challenges on environmental grounds in a full judicial review at the Royal Courts of Justice.\nIndigo Evans from Grow Heathrow said the issue of climate change was acute and that the runway had to be stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s time for drastic action on climate change, not new runways. For nine years we\u2019ve stood shoulder to shoulder with the Heathrow villages and people affected by climate chaos around the world. We\u2019re here to stay,\u201d she said.",

In clinical trials PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV by 75-86%.\nA report by NHS National Services Scotland into the first year of PrEP provision also revealed that more than 90% of those considered eligible for the drug came forward for prescriptions, and that one-fifth of those had never visited a sexual health clinic before.\nNHS England has resisted rolling out PrEP because of the cost, although campaigners argue it is far cheaper than a lifetime of HIV treatment, which can cost \u00a3360,000. After losing to campaigners in the courts, NHS England has enrolled thousands of people in a major trial to answer \u201csignificant outstanding implementation questions\u201d. PrEP is also available from sexual health clinics in Wales.\nProf David Goldberg, chair of Scotland\u2019s HIV PrEP coordinating group, described the drug as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that was \u201cvery likely to reduce substantially the sexual transmission of HIV\u201d.\nHe added that it was too early to draw any conclusions about the impact of PrEP on the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea. Some health professionals have raised concerns that PrEP use may discourage people from using condoms.\nDeborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, which funded the court battle in England, said: \u201cScotland\u2019s progress on PrEP \u2026 puts England\u2019s sluggish delivery to shame.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cA fifth of people accessing PrEP attended sexual health clinics for the first time, which shows PrEP increases people\u2019s engagement with sexual healthcare. This means that as well as bringing down HIV infection rates for the first time, PrEP may help us diagnose, treat and contain other STIs\u201d.\nGold said there was still work to be done to make sure women and other groups could access PrEP: of the 1,872 individuals who were prescribed PrEP in Scotland during the first 12 months, 99% were men who have sex with men.",

Sign up now!\nIn an episode sociologists will one day surely reference as a textbook study in collective cognitive dissonance, a large number of Parkhead regulars rushed to various online forums and social media disgraces on Tuesday to accuse their former manager of not being loyal enough. It didn\u2019t help that Brendan Rodgers was later pictured in a dressing room lined with blue shirts and Ibroxian wood panelling, standing on some light blue Jock Wallace Memorial Carpet, in a stadium named in celebration of the strength and authority of a sovereign monarch. Still, Neil Lennon\u2019s officially back, and they like him more, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Plus the new interim boss insists he\u2019s \u201cmellow\u201d these days, so that augurs well doesn\u2019t it. In other news, the Old Firm derby is scheduled for Sunday 31 March at high noon, so set your watch for that.\nRodgers was perhaps the happiest of quite a few giddy Premier League managers on Tuesday night. Marco Silva was delighted to see his Everton team break a three-match losing run with victory at Cardiff, just in time to start another one at the weekend, in spectacular own-foot-shooting style no doubt. Jan Siewert cavorted with glee as Huddersfield ended a 15-game wait for a win, even though the Terriers always beat Wolves \u2013 that\u2019s five in a row now, let\u2019s keep everything in perspective. And after Newcastle swatted aside Burnley, Rafa Ben\u00edtez adjusted his tie in business-like fashion while clearing his throat quietly, a typical display of raw emotion from the great man. But King Brenny outdid them all! Responding to the generous welcome he received from Leicester fans, he flashed a smile so broad and dazzling that, just for one second, you were certain those pearly-white chompers were going to start dancing in the style of popular music-hall entertainer Conrad Poohs.\n\u201cSpecial things are on the horizon,\u201d he promised both players and staff after beating Brighton, and not all of them were disappointed to discover he was only referring to the PowerPoint presentation he\u2019s planning to give on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m excited about watching that!\u201d trilled first-team coach Mike Stowell, perhaps unaware that more than two thirds of it consists of motivational quotes illustrated with pictures of Rodgers greeting other managers with disproportionate excitement; slides 48 through 73 address the best way to fold your kit to \u201cspark joy\u201d; and there\u2019s a bit at the end explaining how strong he likes his tea. Whether he plans to pull that stunt with the envelopes again isn\u2019t clear, though there have been rumours that the turn, popularised in the legendary variety show Being: Liverpool, has since developed into an act heavily influenced by Eric Morecambe\u2019s funny paper bag trick. If true, here\u2019s hoping someone captures that one on film as well, so it too will be repeated ad nauseam for the rest of Brenny\u2019s career.\nJoin \u2026 deep breath \u2026 Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Chelsea 1-2 Tottenham, while Barry Glendenning will be on clockwatch duty, Gregg Bakowski will deal with Real Madrid 2-1 Barcelona (agg: 3-2) in the Copa del Rey semis and Bryan Graham will handle England 1-1 Brazil in the SheBelieves Cup.\n\u201cThe fight for my release was something special.

The reviews aggregator site announced that it will prevent users from commenting on a film before its release date, after a recent barrage of negative online comments targeting the forthcoming Captain Marvel film.\nRotten Tomatoes\u2019 move came as it cited an \u201cuptick in non-constructive input, sometimes bordering on trolling\u201d. Captain Marvel, the widely anticipated 21st instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which stars Brie Larson in the title role, is released in US and UK cinemas on 8 March, but has nonetheless been subject to a flurry of negative reviews posted to the film\u2019s Rotten Tomatoes page over the last few weeks, resulting in its \u201caudience score\u201d plummeting from 96% to 54%. It appears the backlash has been fuelled by Larson\u2019s recent comments about the movie\u2019s press tour, in which she expressed growing concerns about the \u201coverwhelmingly white male\u201d proportion of film journalists she has spoken to over the last few years. In an interview with Marie Claire earlier this year, the actor, who won an Oscar in 2016 for her performance in Room, spoke about utilising her role as the eponymous superhero to campaign for increased diversity in the movie industry.\nRotten Tomatoes\u2019 influence on movies\u2019 box-office performance has been widely acknowledged in the industry, with Ethan Titelman, an executive at Hollywood market research firm National Research Group, telling the Guardian: \u201cIts influence is growing and broadening out.

The plunge in M&S\u2019s share price \u2013 the biggest one-day fall since 2016 \u2013 wiped more than \u00a3550m off the retailer\u2019s market value. Ocado\u2019s shares rose by 3%.\nRowe rejected suggestions that M&S had paid too much to get into the growing internet grocery business. \u201cWe think we\u2019re paying a fair price and I think Ocado do too,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday.\nTim Steiner, the founder and chief executive of Ocado, said: \u201cI think Steve and his team have taken an incredibly smart risk today. It\u2019s not like going to a casino and laying down a chip. You\u2019ve got to take calculated risks where your upside is enormous, your downside is minimal and your investment to do it is sensible.\u201d\nRowe said he had expected M&S shares to fall as the company announced a \u00a3600m rights issue \u2013 together with a surprise 40% cut in its dividend payout \u2013 in order to fund the deal. \u201cThis is not about the short term,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about the transformation of Marks & Spencer [and] the transformation of online grocery shopping in the UK.\u201d\nHe said partnering with Ocado was the only way to bring M&S food to more shoppers, because its range of products was too small for consumers to do a whole weekly shop directly with M&S. The average M&S shopper spends \u00a313 on each shop, compared with average shopping bills of more than \u00a3100 at Ocado. Rowe said the partnership \u201cenables us to take our food online in an immediately profitable, scalable and sustainable way\u201d.\nHowever, some M&S investors questioned the wisdom of the deal. Paul Mumford, investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management, which owns a small stake in M&S, said: \u201cWhichever way you look at it, raising \u00a3600m to invest in a joint-venture which may or may not work seems an extravagant use of shareholders\u2019 money.\u201d\nAnalysts also raised concerns about the price paid by M&S. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cM&S\u2019s purchase of Ocado\u2019s UK retail business looks rather like one of its own ready meals \u2013 expensive, not very good for you but easy, quick and ready to heat up.\u201d\nNick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, described the deal as \u201cvery puzzling\u201d and a \u201chuge leap in the dark\u201d for M&S. \u201cIt may be understandable that Ocado wanted to ditch Waitrose but it is hard to understand why M&S want to buy into the existing Ocado distribution infrastructure (which services Morrisons etc), at a cost of at least \u00a3750m, rather than just become a new partner.\u201d\nRichard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC Europe, said. \u201cWe think [M&S] is paying a high price which reflects it being very late to the [online] party.\u201d\nSteiner described the deal, which was signed at 6.05am on Wednesday, as a \u201ctransformative moment in the UK retail sector\u201d that would combine \u201ctwo iconic and much-loved retail brands set to provide an unrivalled online grocery offer\u201d.\nHe said the joint-venture would allow Ocado to \u201cgrow faster, add more jobs, and create more value\u201d.\nRob Collins, the managing director of Waitrose, said he was confident that shoppers who use Ocado to buy Waitrose goods would migrate to Waitrose.com.",

The announcements were made alongside the bank\u2019s annual results on Tuesday night.\nMetro Bank\u2019s share price slumped once again on Wednesday and was down more than 26% at about 950p shortly before the London market closed. The company\u2019s shares have lost 50% of their value since the accounting issue was announced.\nThe lender confirmed in January that hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms and should have been among its \u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d (RWAs). While the bank originally suggested it had uncovered the issue on its own, it later emerged the error was caught by the PRA.\nCraig Donaldson, the CEO, is now giving up his annual bonus, which was worth \u00a3800,000 in 2017, over the debacle. He also offered to resign, but said he has full backing of the board and is staying put. After apologising to investors over the affair, he denied that the latest cash call was influenced by the loans misclassification.\nThe challenger bank raised \u00a3303m from investors last July, after which Donaldson ruled out further cash calls to fuel the lender\u2019s growth in the medium term.\nWhen asked to respond to criticism over his U-turn, the CEO said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that we would always look to raise capital when it\u2019s right for the organisation and we want to raise capital in advance of the growth, and therefore we made the decision over the last few days and weeks to raise the capital now.\u201d\nJohn Cronin, a financials analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said the recent slowdown in deposit growth and the fact that Metro was \u201cconsistently in need\u201d of more core capital were all \u201cserious concerns\u201d. He said it is not yet clear how the stock would react over the coming days, but expected shares to fall to 729p.\nMetro Bank shareholder Royal London Asset Management said the recent accounting error threw up red flags for investors. \u201cGovernance issues are always the canary in the coalmine. This case is no different. We are seeking a meeting with the company to understand the steps it is taking to reassure shareholders and improve governance and accounting oversight.\u201d",

Well, all but one club\u2019s work, that is. \u201cMan Utd got in touch and made us stop selling our wonky drawings of their ex-players. If you\u2019ve ordered one, we\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d the Pratchetts wrote on Twitter.\n\u201cWe were surprised rather than upset or angry, but it is what it is,\u201d Alex told the Guardian. \u201cWe fired off one or two tweets which maybe revealed our frustration a bit, but we don\u2019t really have a moral high horse to get on because in the eyes of the law our childish yellow and red circle squiggle apparently looks enough like United\u2019s crest to impinge on their trademarks.\u201d\nThe couple tweeted one of their far-from-perfect images of the Manchester United club crest alongside the official one to highlight just how far off the mark they felt their crude imitation was from being \u201cintellectual property theft\u201d.\nThey sent us a bunch of trademark numbers, including some that relate the their badge. So they're saying that this is intellectual property theft... pic.twitter.com/GBSEtRPzYo\nA club spokesman told the BBC: \u201cPermission to use Manchester United\u2019s intellectual property is only granted to official licensees, partners and sponsors of the club. Because Panini Cheapskates\u2019 items featured the Manchester United word mark, they unfortunately infringed those intellectual property rights.\u201d\nSince then, the innovative Pratchetts believe they have found a way around the club\u2019s sticker shutdown. \u201cA few of our followers suggested adding \u2018football club\u2019 to our version of the badge, as United had famously removed it from theirs not too long ago, but our handwriting just isn\u2019t up to that,\u201d said Alex.\n\u201cWe thought it\u2019d be nice to turn this nonsense around and do something good with it, so we removed the badge/splodge, renamed it \u2018Man Red\u2019 in tribute to various unlicensed football video game franchises, changed Wayne Rooney to \u2018Ray Wooney\u201d, Mark Hughes to \u2018Spark Youse\u2019, etc and relaunched it as a charity item, which went amazingly well and raised about \u00a3500 for Cancer Research.\u201d\nThey have been contacted by one other club, but in that instance it was a request from West Bromwich Albion for the amateur artists to draw their former players so they could be sold for charity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking the most sensible thing to do would be to preempt any further aggro along these lines and retrospectively give the \u2018Man Red\u2019 treatment to the rest of our back catalogue of terrible drawings,\u201d adds Alex. \u201cWhich means we have a lot of wonky badges to erase and a lot of silly names to think up. Come to think of it, we should probably change our name to Panono.\u201d",

        "content": "The US has usually been the decisive voice of calm, but its influence has waned under Trump\nDuring previous bouts of militarised aggression between India and Pakistan, US presidents used personal diplomacy to convince both sides to pull back from the brink.\nSuch was the case in 1999 during the Kargil war and then again in 2002. Similarly in December 2008 Condoleezza Rice, then US secretary of state, travelled to India to persuade the government to pull back from a planned severe response after the Mumbai attacks, putting the onus on Pakistan to cooperate transparently.\nIt is doubtful that today either President Trump or his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has the same leverage in the region as their predecessors. The more unipolar world in which some recent American presidents operated has passed, replaced by a new era of Great Power competition between the US, Russia and China.\nAlso, Trump has shown little interest in being even-handed in the region, increasingly siding with India and shunning Pakistan partly due to accumulating American suspicions about the role the Pakistani military has played in covertly tolerating terrorist groups on its soil and in Afghanistan, a charge Islamabad fiercely denies.\nTrump made his attitude towards Pakistan clear in January 2018 when he tore up plans for $1.3bn (\u00a3980m) of military aid and imposed sanctions for Pakistan\u2019s alleged support for terrorist groups. On Twitter he bluntly accused Pakistan of \u201cproviding nothing but lies and deceit\u201d.\nBy contrast, the US president has feted India\u2019s Narendra Modi, openly hailing his leadership, signing multiple military cooperation deals and renaming the US Pacific Command as Indo-Pacific Command in 2018.\nBut American influence in the region has also fallen due to plain neglect. Trump\u2019s attention has been elsewhere, focused on toppling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, making friends with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and seeking to squeeze the regime in Tehran hard enough to prompt an Iranian middle-class revolt.\nTo the extent that the US is diplomatically active in the region, it has been to secure a peace deal to end the Afghan war and bring US troops home. There is, for instance, no US assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs. The deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, Alice Wells, is highly regarded, but does not have the political clout of Rice, or Richard Armitage, the US deputy secretary of state at the time of the 2002 crisis, a man with two decades\u2019 worth of contacts with the Pakistan military.\nThere is also a sense that this crisis flared with little warning. The Kashmir dispute has rumbled on with repeated shootings across the line of control, punctuated by larger-scale terrorist outrages, but there was no prior intelligence of a major terrorist attack on Indian army recruits, let alone one large enough to prompt warplanes to fly across the frontier.\nThe US is not alone in being blindsided. The subject was totally absent from discussion at the Munich Security Forum at the weekend. Not a single question about the looming conflict was aired, for instance, during hour-long Foreign Office questions on Tuesday. That is quite remarkable given the UK\u2019s role in the birth of the two nations in 1948, and the large Kashmiri population in the UK.\nSince Tuesday, Pompeo has scrambled to catch up, urging both sides to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d and avoid an escalation. But given the longstanding US intelligence assessment of how quickly a war between these two countries could spiral out of control, the lack of urgency in Washington is notable.\nThe withdrawal of America as a neutral powerbroker has left China with a degree of diplomatic influence over Pakistan that it could not claim two decades ago. China has provided Pakistan with nuclear and missile technology and equipment, conventional arms and \u2013 under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor \u2013 billions of dollars of investment in strategic projects, such as the port of Gwadar.\nChina may yet prove to be the more decisive diplomatic influence in enforcing restraint. Pakistan\u2019s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, not far from where Indian warplanes struck on Tuesday morning, is a major site of Chinese investment. The $1.3bn (\u00a3980m) 70-mile Thakot-Havelian road project passes through Mansehra, a district where the Indian air attacks took place. A major hydropower project is also under construction. Further military action in the area could jeopardise that investment.\n\u201cWe hope that both India and Pakistan can exercise restraint and adopt actions that will help stabilise the situation in the region and improve mutual relations,\u201d the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said.\nUltimately though, it may be the existence of nuclear weapons that pulls the two countries back, rather than outside intervention. With an army more than twice as large, backed by superior weaponry and with an economy 8.5 times the size of Pakistan\u2019s, India can strike hard. But military analysts say this imbalance means Pakistan\u2019s threshold for the use of nuclear weapons is relatively low; a direct attack by India could have incalculable consequences.",

        "content": "Forget an interest rate increase any time soon, there is plainly no heat in the economy\nOn Friday a small but significant shift occurred in the Australian economic firmament. While appearing before the house economics committee, the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, announced that he believed the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (Nairu) had a 4 in front of it.\nThe Nairu is a fairly economic wonky term for what is otherwise referred to either as the natural rate of unemployment or full employment. The reason why it is now mostly referred to as the Nairu is because terms like natural rate or full employment suggest a finality which most politicians or policy makers would not wish to subscribe.\nWhat it essentially refers to is the level unemployment can reach before inflation starts rising \u2013 and rising at an accelerated rate.\nIt is not a fixed level. A recent study by the RBA had the Nairu around 6% during the 1980s, a bit higher in the 1990s, before falling steadily during the mining boom, and falling again after the GFC until in 2017 is was considered to be around 5%.\nIf we look at the period from 1992, when we came out of the recession, until 2008, when the GFC hit, we can see that as unemployment fell from 11% in 1992 to 5% in 2005, inflation growth remained largely within the 2% to 3% range.\nBut once it went below 5%, inflation growth began to speed up, and when unemployment hit 4.2% in June 2007 we saw a sharp rise \u2013 almost like we had hit a wall:\nThis is why the Nairu was considered to be around 5% \u2013 once it went below that, wages growth rise and then so too would inflation until it reached a point where it seems to take off \u2013 as it did in 2007.\nBut on Friday Lowe told the house economics committee that \u201cI think this country can have an unemployment rate close to 4\u00bd per cent without wage growth causing problems for inflation.\u201d\nThis has big implications for economic policy.\nRight now we have unemployment of 5.1%. If 5% were considered the Nairu, then that means you believe that were unemployment to go any lower than it is now, inflation is going to become an issue. And that suggests that maybe the RBA needs to think about raising interest rates to take some heat out of the economy.\nBut plainly there is no heat in the economy,\nOn Monday the latest figures for production prices were released showing that domestic demand in the past year grew at just 1.75%, and meant that in the past seven years just two quarters have seen growth above 2% (compared to a pre-2012 average of 3.6%):\nOn Wednesday the latest construction figures showed a decline in the volume of work done in the March quarter \u2013 and signalled a sharp fall in the level of public sector work being done:\nAnd similarly the growth of new residential building work being down is well down of what is was during the peak housing boom period in Sydney of 2016:\nClearly the Reserve Bank knows that there is little heat in the economy because for five years now it has set the cash rate either just on or actually below the level of inflation \u2013 a situation usually reserved for emergency periods of stimulus such as during the GFC:\nDespite the RBA having its foot very firmly on the economy accelerator, inflation growth remains lacking.\nWhen we compare the unemployment rate with inflation growth over the past eight years we see that even as we approach 5% unemployment there is no sign of accelerating inflation:\nConsider that there have only been 12 quarters where our unemployment rate has been either 5.0% or 5.1% (in 2004-06, 2010-12 and December 2018), and in all previous times the underlying inflation rate was usually nearing 3%; now it is just 1.8%:\nWhat does this mean? Well, firstly forget any interest rate increase any time soon. Clearly the RBA believes until unemployment is consistently below 5% there is little need to worry about inflation.\nIt also means, given wages growth generally rises with inflation, the RBA (without saying it explicitly) does not see wages about to start growing faster \u2013 certainly nowhere above 3% - until unemployment gets closer to 4.5%.\nBut when you consider that over the past three years the construction industry has been one of the key sectors for job growth and it now looks to be slowing quite drastically, that does not bode well for unemployment continuing to fall at all.\nAnd if it doesn\u2019t fall, not only is talk about the Nairu moot, so too are hopes of our wages growth improving.\n Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

        "content": "Camille Vidal-Naquet kicks off a candid account of the savage realities facing a young sex worker with a startling twist\nFeature first-timer Camille Vidal-Naquet creates a tough, intriguing if incurious study of a young homeless hustler, starring F\u00e9lix Maritaud (who was Max in Robin Campillo\u2019s Act Up drama 120 Beats Per Minute). He plays Leo, who makes an impact in the opening scene in a doctor\u2019s office, as this beautiful young man talks about his cough and takes his clothes off, to reveal various marks and lesions that he is carefully asked about. The scene ends with a startling twist, establishing a note of irony that is ingenious but slightly out of kilter with the succeeding action.\nWhat is interesting about Sauvage is that it shows how savagely boring Leo\u2019s life is, quite a lot of the time. He just has to stand around by the roadside in all weathers, as cars cruise past and either stop or more often accelerate past. He doesn\u2019t get to read books or magazines and you never see him or any of the other men staring at their phones. It\u2019s clearly bad for business. You have to look sexually available at all times.\nLeo has formed an ambiguous relationship with another hustler, Ahd (\u00c9ric Bernard) after the two men were taken back to a client\u2019s place for a three-way. Ahd likes Leo but is clearly annoyed by his clinging neediness. Does Leo imagine himself to be in love? Is Leo, in fact, in love?\nThe bought-sex scenes, with their ricochets of violence, robbery and vulnerability, are candidly presented. So, too, are Leo\u2019s subsequent \u201cdoctor\u201d scenes. There is a great moment when he is asked to lie down on the examination couch and poor Leo instinctively turns on his side, rather than on his back, like a child trying to go to sleep.\nI wasn\u2019t sure about the ending of the film, the sequence that gestures at the title\u2019s meaning. Does Leo have a kind of loyalty to the feral, almost pastoral existence of being a hustler? It\u2019s a contrived and slightly unsatisfying image. But Maritaud\u2019s performance has power.",

        "content": "Another climate announcement comes as the Coalition attempts to win back concerned voters\nThe Morrison government will persist with its attempted climate policy pivot by promising $50m in grants for businesses and community organisations to embark on energy efficiency projects, and an additional $17m to help building owners benchmark their energy use.\nThe proposed investment in energy efficiency, which is one of the components of the government\u2019s strategy for meeting Australia\u2019s Paris commitments, comes as the prime minister has sent a public signal that Victorian energy retailers will have to pick up the costs of electricity transmitted through a second interconnector between Tasmania and the mainland.\nAs part of the government\u2019s efforts to woo back voters in its small \u201cl\u201d liberal heartland deeply concerned about the Coalition\u2019s record on climate change, Morrison has this week kicked in $56m for the Marinus link, and has flagged further taxpayer underwriting of the \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d renewable energy project.\nBut asked by reporters how the total costs of the proposed interconnector would be met, given the feasibility study for Marinus link puts those costs between $1bn and $3bn, and also makes it clear the \u201clargest single influencing factor in the economic feasibility and timing of [the project] is the trajectory of coal-fired generation retirement\u201d, the prime minister said: \u201cIt\u2019d be a commercial project and a commercial project means it can support its finance.\n\u201cSo what does that mean when I say it\u2019s on a commercial basis? It means it can pay for itself. It means it can actually generate the revenues that actually support its financing.\u201d\nMorrison said it was only fair that Victoria pick up the costs of the project because the \u201cbeneficiary of having that reliable power will be in Victoria and the consumers will be the ones who obviously pay the power bills which will be lower, by the way, in terms of what we\u2019re able to produce out of Tasmania.\u201d\nUnder the normal regulatory arrangements for transmission infrastructure, the costs would be apportioned between the two jurisdictions, but Tasmania is unhappy with that arrangement.\nThe Victorian minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said the Morrison government had failed to provide national leadership on climate change \u201cand in the absence of any federal leadership, we\u2019re taking nation-leading action to address it\u201d.\nShe said Victoria was pressing ahead with a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and increasing the state renewable energy target to 50% by 2030.\nThe federal government\u2019s decision this week to greenlight the long-mooted Snowy Hydro expansion, and flag taxpayer underwriting for the Tasmanian proposals, has perturbed energy executives, heightening concerns that the government is again extemporising on energy policy.\nThere are concerns about the high costs of the projects, plus the associated transmission infrastructure, and also fears the two large developments will crowd out worthy smaller renewables and gas peaking projects.\nAs well as the significant industry concerns, environmental groups and climate policy experts have panned the government\u2019s decision to resurrect Tony Abbott\u2019s emissions reduction fund, give it a new name and a $2bn budget over 10 years \u2013 pointing out that the fund cannot do the heavy lifting on emissions reduction required to meet the Paris target.\nThe government this week specified various components of an abatement plan consistent with Australia meeting the 2030 target.\nTo meet the target, the government intends to count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits, which is not practical emissions reduction but an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030.\nIt is also factoring in emissions reduction from the Snowy 2.0 expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy for which there are no details; the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from unspecified \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d and \u201cother sources of abatement\u201d such as projects under development but not yet contracted.\nThe new grants for energy efficiency to be unveiled on Thursday are part of the government\u2019s roadmap. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, will allocate $50m for 2,500 grants to eligible businesses and community organisations to help them save energy by either installing new equipment or by reviewing and improving their energy management.\nEligible small businesses will be able to claim grants of up to $20,000, high-energy using businesses up to $25,000 and community groups up to $12,500.\nTaylor said the energy efficiency measures would deliver an abatement of 63Mt of carbon, and promoting efficient energy usage is an important part of meeting the Paris target and lowering energy costs.",

        "content": "Music festival will no longer sell single-use plastic water bottles in bid to cut waste\nWith its sea of discarded tents and litter-strewn fields, Glastonbury has become almost as infamous for the mountain of rubbish left in its wake as it is renowned for its music.\nBut this year, organisers are hitting back \u2013 by banning plastic bottles in a bid to stem the tide of waste.\nThey have announced the festival will not sell single-use plastic water bottles this year owing to concerns about their impact on the environment.\nWho runs the Glastonbury festival?\nThe first \"Glastonbury festival\" was staged by the then 34-year-old Michael Eavis on the site of his family dairy farm in the village of Pilton in southwest England \u2013 about 6 miles from Glastonbury Tor \u2013 in 1970. The festival was held intermittently until 1979, when it became a (largely) annual event, and Eavis now organises it with his daughter Emily through the company Glastonbury Festivals Limited. (From 2002 until 2012, promoter Melvin Benn assisted the Eavises with operations and licensing.) Emily and her husband Nick Dewey book the acts for the main stages and oversee the management of the festival's many areas. Each year, the festival donates around \u00a32 million to Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid. The Guardian has been the festival's media partner since 1997.\nIn 2017, visitors to the festival got through 1.3m plastic bottles.\n\u201cObviously we are all fighting the fight against plastic, which is an enormous task but well overdue and we need to make steps in the right direction,\u201d said Emily Eavis, the co-organiser of the festival and youngest daughter of the founder, Michael Eavis.\n\u201cA vast amount of plastic bottles were gotten through and when you see images of the arena completely covered in old plastic bottles it\u2019s quite haunting.\n\u201cWe have been working on this during the year off. We spent a lot of time in 2018 working on the logistic side of all this, speaking to suppliers and market managers, area organisers,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe are tackling drinking bottles at the moment, water bottles \u2026 and we are encouraging people to bring their own reusable bottle but there will also be reusable bottles available on site.\u201d\nA Friends of the Earth spokesperson said it was an important step but there was much more to be done to tackle other littering issues linked to festivals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen other festivals giving plastic-free the headliner status it deserves so we\u2019d urge Glastonbury to carry on along the path to plastic-free bliss.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cIt\u2019s time for all festivals to think about things such as food containers, cutlery and encouraging festivalgoers to ditch the plastic tat when thinking about fancy dress. It\u2019s also important that festival kit such as tents is built to last rather than to be abandoned in a field after one use.\u201d\nGreenpeace estimates that globally, 12.7m tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans each year. With more than 1m plastic bottles sold at Glastonbury in 2017, the festival\u2019s organisers said they felt stopping their sale was vital.\nThe organisers said they were encouraging all festivalgoers to use a reusable water bottle and refill it at the free water taps around the site. They said they would also increase the number of WaterAid kiosks on the site where people can refill their bottles or get a free cup of water. Water and soft drinks in recyclable cans will be available to buy from all traders who previously sold soft drinks in plastic bottles, while they will continue to recycle any recyclable waste plastics on site.\nBackstage catering will also be plastic-free, with canned drinks and reusable water bottles available to performers.\nPreviously, the festival banned plastic cutlery and plates from food traders with everything having to be compostable. They note that they already have only paper straws on site. The festival already does not use single-use plastic cups at the bars and the wristbands are made of cloth.\nShambala festival has also taken steps to ban plastic. No drinks are sold in disposable plastics, only reusable bar cups are used and there are no plastic straws. No food is served in plastic and and there are no single-sachet sauces.\nRichard Thompson, professor of marine biology at Plymouth University, said that while he would wish to know more detail the news was \u201ca great step\u201d.\nAdding that it was also important for single-use plastic to be recyclable wherever possible, he said: \u201cIf there is a message for the industry, it\u2019s that this should be a wake-up call and if you don\u2019t get your act together and design plastic packaging so it\u2019s genuinely compatible with recycling on a large scale, people will walk away from plastic.\u201d",

And in the context of what has recently transpired within the Australian game, this Cup of Nations tournament could not be more welcome \u2013 or more important.\nIn the month since the shock sacking of Alen Stajcic the lack of clarity surrounding the process that informed that decision has given rise to a torrent of negativity, suspicion, shadowy accusations and general \u201cbrand damage\u201d for one of Australia\u2019s most beloved sporting teams.\nWhile many around the team environment \u2013 journalists, administrators, former players and staff \u2013 have had plenty to say, those at the centre of what has made the Matildas so highly respected \u2013 the players themselves \u2013 have been largely silent.\nOn Thursday, for the first time in this whole sorry charade the players themselves will finally do their talking. On the pitch.\nSouth Korea, New Zealand and Argentina may not be massive names in women\u2019s football, but as pre-World Cup invitational tournaments go, this is a well-considered schedule \u2013 and as such praise should go to organisers and the governing body for committing the time and funds to such a competition.\nAll three opponents are bound for France in June. Instead of squads of players thrown together last minute with nigh on nothing to play for, the Matildas will face three sides scrapping for every inch of match fitness, and every potential advantage over teammates-cum-rivals vying for World Cup spots. The matches will be as close to non-friendlies football as you can find.\nIn styles and brands of football the three opponents will also offer unique challenges. The technical quality of South Korea, the physical style of New Zealand, the street-smart and tactical approach of Argentina. If you\u2019re looking for potential blueprints for the challenges of Italy, Brazil or Jamaica \u2013 Australia\u2019s Group C opponents in France \u2013 they\u2019re all there.\nMore than that, gaining a close familiarity with three World Cup attendees also gives the Matildas\u2019 technical analysts a base for comparison against potential knockout stage opponents. How Argentina fare against England or Japan, how New Zealand compete with Canada or the Netherlands, or how South Korea hold up against hosts France during the group stages in July will be tested against a wealth of performance data gleaned during this tournament. If even just one weakness in a cup-challenging rival is identified through this process, the Matildas are ahead.\nIn the context of all the negativity of the past few months, the tournament provides a reset for fans and players to enjoy each other once again. The Matildas played on home soil just three times last year; four the year before, and just twice in 2016. For legions of young girls and boys, families and supporters of women\u2019s football, the Cup of Nations is a great opportunity to watch and support these tremendous athletes, up close and personal, before they depart for France.\nNecessarily, there will be huge interest as well in how the Matildas will look in their first competitive games under new coach Ante Milicic and his staff.\nIn his first squad, Milicic has suggested a preference for continuity rather than wholesale change \u2013 with the 23 named in camp almost to a player the squad likely to have been selected by Stajcic. It tells us one thing straight away \u2013 that Milicic is prioritising rebuilding group harmony and team spirit among his squad over blooding new faces.\nIn Brisbane this past week, Milicic will have impressed upon his chargers the broad outlines of his footballing vision \u2013 his preferred tactic systems, key philosophies, and perhaps even basic rotations or patterned movements.\nWith limited time on the training ground before the first match, however, the performance of the Matildas against New Zealand on Thursday will likely tell us more about the players than the new coach.\nOf course they\u2019ll look to impress \u2013 after all, potential World Cup spots are on the line. But it\u2019s also a chance to exorcise some frustrations \u2013 to show the public that the Matildas themselves are as focused, committed and united among themselves, in spite of the whispers of factions and divides exacerbated by the public playing-out of the Stajcic sacking.\nPlaying group leaders such as Sam Kerr and Lydia Williams have spoken publicly about the strength of resolve and the mentality of the group to play for themselves and each other. And while all and sundry have passed judgement from the outside on this incredible crop of players, at last, on the grass of Leichhardt Oval, Suncorp Stadium and AAMI Park, the players themselves will have their say.\n Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

He doesn\u2019t think survivors will take much solace from Pell\u2019s child sexual abuse convictions. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for Ballarat,\u201d he says.\nThere had been immense pride in the town of more than 100,000 people that Pell had become Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic and climbed the ranks at the Vatican, he says.\nA court suppression order was lifted on Tuesday allowing the media to report Pell had been found guilty on five charges of sexually abusing two choir boys in Melbourne in 1996, within months of his inauguration as archbishop.\nCollins wants the focus to shift from the Pell frenzy to helping survivors recover.\n\u201cI\u2019m back to weekly psychiatrist and psychologist sessions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on and off suicide watch constantly. Nobody cares.\n\u201cAs children our tiny bodies were used, abused and cast away. Our minds were screwed up and nobody believed us. Now we are broken adults and those who speak up are called friends of the devil by the pope.\u201d\nAs Pell\u2019s lawyers withdrew a bail application and his sentencing hearing was under way in Melbourne on Wednesday, an estimated 80 parishioners turned out for midday mass at St Patrick\u2019s cathedral on Ballarat\u2019s main street. It was a higher turnout than usual, some churchgoers said.\nGolden light streamed through the arched leadlight windows and the echoed words of the Lord\u2019s prayer bounced off the wooden rafters.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him for many, many years, over 50 years \u2026 I don\u2019t ever believe that George would have done anything like that,\u201d one Ballarat grandmother, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian.\nLife-long Ballarat resident Edda Clark says the conviction was \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\u201cThey hate him. They just hate him. To me people are just out to get him. I feel he\u2019s the person who has to take the blame for all the sexual abuse that happened in Australia. That\u2019s on his shoulders.\u201d\nA royal commission hearing in 2015 was told up to 14 priests in Ballarat had sexually abused children and there have been at least 130 claims and substantiated complaints since 1980.\nSurvivor groups estimate more than 50 suicides are linked to historic sexual abuse by priests.\nPaul Auchettl, 60, who attended St Alipius primary school, was molested by his year six teacher, the notorious paedophile Christian Brother Robert Best. Best is likely to die in jail. Auchettl\u2019s younger brother Peter was also abused and committed suicide 10 years ago.\n\u201cWe knew we were being hunted,\u201d Auchettl says.\nAuchettl was one of 15 survivors who travelled to Rome on a $200,000 crowd-funded trip to see Pell give evidence to the royal commission via video link.\n\u201cWe thought he was an enabler, then we thought he was a denier, and now we know he\u2019s an offender,\u201d he says.\nThe anger in Ballarat is palpable, he says, and the verdict clashes with the belief systems of many.\n\u201cMy parents feel bad for fluffing around him and adoring him,\u201d he says. \u201cSo do many people in the community. They feel like they have been totally conned.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a prince of the church fall like this. He\u2019s a product from here. It\u2019s like with celebrities they are almost untouchable. You\u2019re not allowed to say a bad thing about them.\u201d\nHe believes Ballarat must brace for a second wave of difficult untold abuse stories to come out.\n\u201cI know many children and young adults [who were abused, went on to] offend against their sisters, their wives and sometimes even their daughters,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can get to that next layer. This is the flow-on, the ripple effect. It\u2019s going to be hard for women to tell those stories.\u201d\nFor Lou Ridsdale, a dark cloud looms over the town regardless of Pell\u2019s conviction.\nHer uncle, the paedophile priest Gerarld Ridsdale, lived with Pell in a parish house in 1973, and abused up to nine of her cousins and scores of other children in Ballarat in the 1960s to the 80s. In 1993 Pell famously accompanied Ridsdale to his appearance at Melbourne magistrates\u2019 court.\n\u201cYou only have to throw a stone in any direction and you\u2019ll encounter someone associated with clergy abuse in this town,\u201d Lou says.\nAnd it\u2019s not only victims who are hurting.\n\u201cYou have many instances where parents of survivors feel eternal guilt for what happened to their children, either because they didn\u2019t believe their children when they were told, or suspected but never said anything, or simply did not know,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThen there are the children of survivors who often [but not always] are neglected as their parents are grappling with such profound trauma they are understandably unable to care for themselves let alone their kids.\u201d\nThat generational poverty has been something Lou has tried to address through a community garden project called Food is Free. She also supports the Loud Fence movement that Maureen Hatcher started in which people tie colourful ribbons around fences of Catholic schools and churches.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had abuse hurled at me by parishioners, a near-miss physical attack, had a nun harass me and actually hiss at me like some deranged animal and circle me for a full 30 minutes, but it\u2019s never stopped me,\u201d Lou says.\nAfter his conviction, Pell\u2019s former school, St Patrick\u2019s college, announced it was rebadging a wing named in his honour.\nCathedral priest Justin Driscoll, who has been in Ballarat for 20 years, says the diocese has a long road ahead to rebuild trust in the community.\n\u201cI\u2019m mindful of so many people hurting,\u201d he says.\nThe federal MP for Ballarat, Catherine King, who could be health minister if Labor wins the federal election, says her priorities for survivors include easier access to the redress compensation scheme and automatic mental health plans for subsidised psychology sessions.\u201c[Pell] is the tip of the iceberg in the church dealing with this \u2026 The church\u2019s culture has got to change really significantly and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s showing real evidence it can do that yet,\u201d she says.\n\u201cFor survivors \u2026 nothing is going to restore their childhood but what they want desperately is that this will never happen again.\u201d\n* Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

Both claim it in full, and each controls a section of the territory. These sections are separated by one of the most heavily militarised borders in the world, known as the line of control, where there are frequent exchanges of artillery and small arms fire. The two countries have gone to war three times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999.\nThe roots of the current escalation lie in a bomb attack by Pakistan-based militants, Jaish-e-Mohammad, on an Indian army convoy in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir on 14 February, which killed 40 troops.\nIndia blamed Pakistan for the bombing, and in the early hours of Tuesday it launched attacks from the furthest inside Pakistani territory since 1971, targeting with airstrikes what it claimed was a terrorist training camp. Pakistan said the Indian jets dropped bombs on a hilltop near the town of Balakot but there were no casualties, and it produced photographs to back up its claims. Pakistan\u2019s military spokesman told India\u2019s leaders to prepare for a \u201csurprise\u201d.\nPakistan launched strikes on the Indian side of the line of control and a dogfight ensued when Indian jets retaliated. Pakistan said two Indian jets were shot down and India said it hit one Pakistani warplane, which fell on the Pakistani side of the border. Pakistan captured an Indian pilot, identified as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan.\nPakistan said it kept a safe distance from military and civilian sites and stayed on its side of the line of control when it launched its airstrikes, but India claimed Pakistan targeted a military installation. Pakistan denied losing a jet.\nThe incidents have raised concerns of a greater escalation. Tens of thousands of Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off along the Kashmir boundary and the sides both possess nuclear weapons.\nPakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has appealed for talks with India, making reference to both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals: \u201cWith the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation? Shouldn\u2019t we think that if this escalates, what will it lead to?\u201d\nIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has yet to comment publicly.

From who?\u201d he asked them.\nWhen told it had been the prime minister, Javid replied: \u201cDid you? Right, ok\u201d, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy with that amendment.\u201d\nThere was further confusion when an hour later, Costa left his post as parliamentary private secretary to the Scotland secretary, David Mundell.\nSources close to Costa said he was given no option but to resign, after tabling the amendment. A source said: \u201cIt seems ridiculous for the government to be sacking a parliamentary private secretary over an amendment that has cross\u2013party support and the support of upwards of 60 Tory backbenchers and Sajid Javid.\u201d\nStarmer told the house the chaos was a \u201cvignette on how Brexit has been going\u201d.\nA Downing Street spokesman said Costa had not been sacked. \u201cHe resigned from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be aware that there is a longstanding convention that members of the government payroll, including PPSs, don\u2019t table amendments to government bills. Clearly this is an issue that he feels very strongly about and so he has chosen to resign.\u201d\nHe said it was \u201cabsolutely wrong to say the PM signalled at any stage that the government would oppose\u201d the amendment. The proposal would have passed comfortably even if the government had not supported it as it had both the support of the Labour party and more than 60 Tory backbenchers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nCosta, the son of Italian immigrants, has been quietly lobbying May over EU citizens\u2019 rights for two years.\n1/4 Can\u2019t begin to say how brilliant it is to see my amendment in black and white on the order paper today. I\u2019m hugely grateful to those colleagues who have very kindly supported my amendment to ringfence rights for those EU citizens in the UK and those in UK citizens in the EU. pic.twitter.com/zrhwN9ljpw\nThe home secretary also came under sustained attack for the registration system the government is about to launch nationally for EU citizens.\nThe Labour MP Stephen Doughty described the \u201csettled status\u201d scheme as a shambles and told Javid the basis of registration was discriminatory as it required EU citizens to request rights they already had.\nIt would also recategorise them in a no-deal scenario as a cohort of the population who did not have rights if they did not have a settled status.\n\u201c\u2018If people are having to secure those rights then, by definition, they don\u2019t have those rights,\u201d Doughty said. \u201cYou are at risk of having Windrush all over again.\n\u201cIn a hostile environment, they are going to be at risk of not being able to access services, not being able to access housing, potentially being detained by the immigration authorities.\u201d",

He declared his former boss was a racist, a conman and a cheat.\n\u201cToday, I am here to tell the truth about Mr Trump,\u201d Cohen said.\nThe finding that Donald Jr was directly involved in the scheme to pay off Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, could mean the president\u2019s son faces legal jeopardy. Federal prosecutors in New York, who have had copies of the checks and other records for months, say the payments violated campaign finance laws.\nCohen is the first Trump associate to publicly allege that the president had inside information about WikiLeaks releasing Democratic emails, which US intelligence agencies say were hacked by Russian operatives working to help Trump\u2019s campaign.\nTrump received the information on WikiLeaks in the days before the Democratic party convention July 2016 in a telephone call from Roger Stone, his longtime friend and adviser, according to Cohen, who said the call was placed on speakerphone.\n\u201cMr Stone told Mr Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr Assange told Mr Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u2018wouldn\u2019t that be great.\u2019\u201d\nTrump has denied knowing about the hacking of Democratic emails or of plans for their release. Stone previously claimed to have been in touch with Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, but now says that he was lying about this.\nStone, whose public statements have been restricted by a judge\u2019s gag order, said on Wednesday: \u201cMr Cohen\u2019s statement is untrue.\u201d\nRobert Mueller, the special counsel, is concluding a two-year investigation into any links or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is accused of sharing polling data with an alleged Russian intelligence operative. Trump has dismissed Mueller\u2019s inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\nCohen also said that he recalled Donnald Trump Jr, the president\u2019s eldest son, telling his father \u201cin a low voice\u201d in early June 2016: \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d Cohen claims this was a reference to Donald Jr\u2019s now-infamous gathering with several Russians, including a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, at Trump Tower that month.\n\u201cI remember Mr Trump saying, \u2018OK good \u2026 let me know,\u201d Cohen said in his prepared remarks. He said Trump had previously complained that Donald Jr \u201chad the worst judgment of anyone in the world\u201d and would not have set up a meeting of such significance without clearing it with his father.\nTrump told Mueller in a series of written answers last year that he did not discuss WikiLeaks with Stone and did not know of the Trump Tower meeting in advance, according to CNN.\nMichael Cohen was a lawyer for Donald Trump from 2006 until 2018. He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump\u2019s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.\nIn August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nCohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump\u2019s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.\nHaving previously described himself as \u201cthe guy who would take a bullet for the president\u201d, when sentenced, Cohen said \u201cI have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.\u201d\nThe 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans. He is expected to report to jail in May 2019.\nMartin Belam\n\nCohen was preparing for a marathon hearing of the oversight committee, which has 42 members. Republicans keen to defend the president were expected to attack his credibility. Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including lying to Congress and is scheduled to go to prison in May to begin a three-year sentence.\nHis prepared remarks painted a scathing picture of a mobster-like president, who denounced Cohen as a \u201crat\u201d for turning on his former boss. Cohen recalled being dispatched by Trump to shortchange suppliers and to threaten his schools that they must not release his student grades.\nDescribing his testimony as a step on \u201cpath of redemption\u201d, Cohen apologized to Congress for his past lies about the details of Trump\u2019s plans in 2016 to build a tower in Moscow. He also said sorry to the country for \u201cworking to hide from you the truth about Mr Trump when you needed it most\u201d.\nCohen described being intoxicated by Trump\u2019s charisma in the early days of their work together. Now, he said, he understood Trump was an unkind, disloyal man in whom \u201cthe bad far outweighs the good\u2019\u201d.\nTrump said black people were \u201ctoo stupid\u201d to vote for him and remarked during a drive through a poor area of Chicago that \u201conly black people could live that way,\u201d according to Cohen. \u201cHe once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u2018shithole\u2019,\u201d Cohen said.",

Five people were stabbed on Tuesday, four of whom were attacked in less than eight hours and one who died.\nIn Birmingham three teenagers have died in knife attacks in the space of two weeks, and 269 knife crimes have been recorded so far this year. Hazrat Umar, 17, was killed in Bordesley Green on Monday; Abdullah Muhammad, 16, died in Small Heath last week; and seven days earlier Sidali Mohamed, 16, was stabbed outside a college in Highgate.\nDavid Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, said in Birmingham city centre on Wednesday: \u201cI would ask the home secretary now to give a special grant here in the West Midlands to help the chief constable and his staff actually tackling what is a serious outbreak we\u2019ve seen here in Birmingham and other parts of the West Midlands.\n\u201cThis is a national emergency, and we must do something about that exclusion of children because those children are on almost an immediate path into crime and into violence.\u201d\nRichard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said it was not surprising to see sudden increases in the number of knife attacks in certain areas before they quietened down. He explained this trend was a result of geographical and temporal clustering.\nHe said: \u201cThere\u2019s geographical clustering that\u2019s related to poverty. There\u2019s a reason for example why mostly young males are being stabbed in parts of Lambeth, for example, or parts of Birmingham rather than outside Buckingham Palace or a village in rural Oxfordshire.\n\u201cThen there\u2019s a temporal clustering where something happens, there\u2019s a retaliation, and then a response to that.\u201d He added the current spate of attacks are a result of \u201ctoxic combination of both\u201d.\nGarside said it was not accurate to describe the spate of knife crime as a national emergency. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small number of the general population that\u2019s either being victimised by this or in fear of their lives. It\u2019s why these incidents seem quite shocking and why the policy world seems to fail to address it in a systematic level because for the vast majority of people, this doesn\u2019t affect them.\u201d He added this results in a level of \u201cshock and complacency that sit side by side\u201d.\nEarlier this year, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, introduced measures where children as young as 12 could be hit with new asbo-style orders designed to clamp down on knife violence. But the move has been criticised by anti-violence campaigners.\nPippa Goodfellow, the director of Standing Committee for Youth Justice, said: \u201cKnife crime Asbos are a knee-jerk reaction that let down the communities that are suffering most. Labelling them as \u2018preventative\u2019 is completely misleading. There is no evidence that they will prevent harmful behaviour or address the root causes of knife-carrying. Those working with young people to tackle these issues on the ground have not been listened to. Their voices must be heard. Reaching yet again for the easy but ineffective punitive option is not the answer.\u201d",

Population has long been a controversial factor in the climate change debate; one recent study said the most effective thing individuals can do to address the crisis was to have one less child.\nHowever, critics insist we should focus instead on overconsumption, and that putting the onus on individuals to address climate change obscures the systematic nature of the crisis. Crucially, they say, it lets the real culprits \u2013 fossil fuel corporations and successive global governments\u2019 inaction \u2013 off the hook.\nAnd even if you accept the premise that having fewer children will tackle climate change, there is also the thorny question of exactly who should be having fewer kids: an American is responsible for 40 times the emissions produced by a Bangladeshi, but often those who advocate population reduction focus on women in the developing world.\nOcasio-Cortez is not encouraging people stop having children. And as the leading advocate of the Green New Deal plan \u2013 which aims to radically transform the US economy by 2030 \u2013 she is one of the few politicians to be working on a plan that might just offer a way to avoid the worst impacts of this crisis.\nBut perhaps she is raising a more profound issue. Faced with a future of social and political breakdown, flooding, deadly heatwaves and food shortages \u2013 and a world full of politicians in various states of denial \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t young people question whether bringing children in the world is a good idea?\nThe answer is one we must all grapple with. But it is worth remembering that throughout history \u2013 even in the most horrific circumstances \u2013 people have continued to have children. It is a profoundly human act.\nAnd the thousands of young people who took to the streets to voice their concern around the climate crisis in recent months are a reminder that often \u2013 far from being the problem \u2013 children embody a profound hope for the future.",

        "content": "Like most theatrical reboots, the strain in keeping things the same in Vietnam highlighted the small way things changed\nDonald Trump vowed that his second meeting with Kim Jong-un would be at least the equal of the first and his Vietnamese hosts tried their utmost to make that happen.\nIn Hanoi on Wednesday evening, every effort was made in recreating the circumstances and ambience of Singapore, scene last June of the historic first meeting between an incumbent US president and a North Korea leader.\nThe backdrop and choreography had been meticulously copied, with the two leaders advancing towards one another in front of a row of alternating US and North Korean flags.\nThey clasped hands as they met, exchanged inaudible words, smiled and pivoted towards the wall of cameras. Just as they had done last June in Singapore, they then sat alongside each other by a coffee table and praised each other for the benefit of the press.\nTrump dubbed Kim, head one of the most murderous regimes of modern times, a \u201cgreat leader\u201d whose future would have a \u201ctremendous future\u201d with US help.\nKim returned the compliment, crediting the fact that the two men were meeting at all because of Trump\u2019s \u201ccourageous decision\u201d. Both men devoted most of their words talking up the significance of Singapore.\nTrump also pointed to the bonhomie between the men as being the principal achievement of Singapore and the eight months since.\n\u201cI think the biggest progress was our relationship, which is really a good one,\u201d he said.\nLater as they sat down to dine on shrimp cocktail, grilled sirloin and chocolate lava cake, Trump seemed so keen to emphasis their friendship that he kept breaking into Kim\u2019s own attempts to describe their encounter.\nKim: \u201cWe had exchanged a very interesting dialogue with each other \u2013 \u201d\nTrump: \u201cWe did.\u201d\nKim: \u201c \u2013 for about 30 minutes.\u201d\nTrump: \u201cBoy, if you could have heard that dialogue, what you would pay for that dialogue? It was good.\u201d\nLike most theatrical remakes, the strain involved in trying to keep things the same only served to highlight the small ways things had changed.\nWhile the Singapore meeting in June was played out in bright sunshine, the two leaders arrived at Hanoi\u2019s Metropole hotel after dark, their oversized black limousines pulling up to the entrance before curtains were drawn around them to allow their occupants to emerge in safety.\nBy the time they met, both men had spent the whole day in Hanoi. Kim seems to have been cloistered in his hotel room. An official photo showed him huddling with advisers around a table with a clipboard and a bowl of sweets.\nTrump had crossed town in the late morning to meet the Vietnamese leadership and announce a sale of Boeing airliners, but after lunch he too had retreated to his hotel, where he stewed in all the news from Washington.\nHis former lawyer, fixer and consigliere, Michael Cohen, had denounced him as a racist cheat and conman in written testimony to Congress.\nTrump fired off a stream of angry tweets, though only one of them was directed at Cohen himself, downplaying their ties, and saying he was \u201cone of many lawyers who represented me\u201d adding Cohen \u201chad other clients also\u201d.\nAt the Singapore summit, Kim arrived at the venue several minutes before Trump, which was interpreted by Korean pundits as a sign of respect from the young leader to the president more than twice his age.\nIf that was true, there was no such respect this time. Kim\u2019s motorcade pulled up to the Metropole hotel a few minutes after Trump. There were smiles for the cameras but they melted away rapidly. Kim appeared more nervous and sweaty than the first time round.\nIt was Trump who seemed the most eager to please, leaning forward off his chair into a half-crouch to take Kim\u2019s hand.\nIn Singapore, in the wake of a thunderous war of words that brought their two countries dangerously close to war, just meeting and shaking hands was enough to notch up a breakthrough for peace, with some justification.\nIn Hanoi, the pressure is far greater on both leaders to score substantive wins: Kim to win sanctions relief; Trump to achieve some progress on North Korean disarmament.\nReports before the summit suggested that their officials had failed to secure compromises on either of these core issues. It had been left to the two leaders to resolve at their Wednesday night dinner and Thursday\u2019s more structured day of talks to pull something out of the bag.\nThe White House appeared to be planning on it. After remaining vague on details of the meeting before Wednesday night\u2019s handshake and dinner, late in the evening it published a precise order of play for Thursday, complete with morning meetings, a lunch and then in the afternoon, a \u201cjoint agreement signing ceremony\u201d and press conference, all with exact timings.\nWhatever accords will be signed then, Wednesday showed that the two leaders already had common ground when it came to the press.\nThe day after Kim had the US press corps ejected from his hotel to safeguard his privacy, the White House sought to exclude print journalists from the brief \u201cavailabilities\u201d at the start of each segment of Wednesday night\u2019s discussions after US reporters had shouted questions to Trump at the initial handshake \u2013 some about the president\u2019s domestic political troubles.\nAfter the Singapore meeting he had expressed admiration for the way North Koreans \u201csit up at attention\u201d when their leader speaks, adding: \u201cI want my people to do the same.\u201d\nIt is a sentiment that the summit leaders shared with their Vietnamese hosts, who had conducted a crackdown on dissidents before the summit, placing dozens under temporary house arrest.\n\u201cAll my fellow activists have been under tight surveillance in these days,\u201d said Nguyen Chi Tuyen, an environmental and human rights advocate, who also blogs under the pen name Anh Chi.\nHe said he had managed to persuade his police watchers to allow him to leave the house if he remained in his neighbourhood.\n\u201cI said they have been following me for years. They know me by now,\u201d Nguyen said in a phone interview from his home.\nThe soft approach, Nguyen said was the smart solution for all concerns. \u201cI get on well with them. They know I am a well-known activist,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something happens to me, news can travel around the world really fast.\u201d\nBesides, while he wished Trump and Kim all the best in their endeavour, he had no yearning to go into the city centre to witness the meeting.\n\u201cWhat would I want to go to see Trump for?\u201d he asked. \u201cI already follow him on Twitter.\u201d",

That is the task the designer Bruno Sialelli is faced with at the French fashion house Lanvin and on Wednesday morning all eyes were on his debut.\nIt\u2019s not an easy task for a young designer who is used to being behind the scenes to take the spotlight, not least at a house which has been in turmoil since the acrimonious departure of its much-loved and revered creative director Alber Elbaz in 2015. Amid staff revolts and sporadic changes in strategy from the then owner, Shaw-Lan Wang, in the three-and-a-half years that have passed the house has seen two designers \u2013 Bouchra Jarrar and Olivier Lapidus \u2013 hurriedly appointed before being swiftly shown the door.\nAs a result, the industry is pinning its hopes on Sialelli not only delivering a collection of hits but reigniting the reciprocal love affair they enjoyed. If he was nervous about his big moment he didn\u2019t show it. While admitting it was an emotional moment, he said after the show that he was focused on \u201credefining the wardrobe\u201d of the house and to do so he visited the personal archive of the house\u2019s founder, Jeanne Lanvin.\nThis was not, however, a trip down memory lane, but a fresh reinvention of the house\u2019s history, which informed but did not dictate.\nSialelli said he was instinctively drawn to the brand\u2019s famous Lanvin blue, which he presented in modern knitwear that took the form of a cardigan-dress hybrid, pea coats with scalloped lapels and blue ribbed tabards.\nThe latter was part of the overriding medieval theme of the show. Sialelli revealed Lanvin herself frequently worked with motifs from the era and he reintroduced it in scarf prints and \u2013 poignantly \u2013 an appliqu\u00e9d motif of a knight in shining armour, a clever nod to Sialelli\u2019s own crusade.\nHe also worked Aztec and Fairisle patterned blankets into inserts on coats as wind-flaps and cuffs. Lanvin was a prolific traveller, he explained, \u201calways bringing back the most beautiful fabrics\u201d from her trips around the world.\nRefreshingly, Sialelli injected a sense of fun and mischief to the house that Elbaz delivered in bucketloads but which has been absent during his successors\u2019 tenures. Illustrations from Jean de Brunhoff\u2019s Babar the Elephant books appeared on silk shirts and bomber jackets, while a fox motif was 3D-appliqu\u00e9d on lace slips, and hemlines came with click-clacky Perspex embellishment.\nHe staged the show in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, installing vases of black tulips beside Pierre de Montreuil\u2019s 13th century statue of Adam, signalling an important detail of the lifestyle direction Sialelli wants Lanvin to take. \u201cJeanne Lanvin was a lifestyle woman \u2013 she started very early to do menswear, womenswear, sportswear, furniture and I think it\u2019s still very valid. There is a legitimacy for the house to propose a valued range of projects [and I] wanted to somehow initiate the house\u2019s lifestyle vision.\u201d\nSialelli worked for four years under JW Anderson at Loewe \u2013 aka the poster brand for blending art, culture, and fashion \u2013 before his appointment at Lanvin, and it is clear he wants to bring that spirit with him.\nBefore that he was in the design team at Balenciaga where he navigated the transition between the head designers Alexander Wang and Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re in 2015, suggesting that he has understanding of the upheaval the long-time atelier team at Lanvin have been through.\nIn February 2018, the private Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, controlled by the billionaire businessman Guo Guangchang, fought off the competition to become majority shareholders in the business, leaving Wang with a minority stake. While details of the deal were undisclosed, the group is said to have injected a minimum of \u20ac100m (\u00a385m) into the brand to help mop up inherited issues and kick-start the house into a new trajectory.\nOn Wednesday, the show notes said Sialelli was \u201csublimating the illustrious heritage of the French maison in the midst of its own renaissance\u201d and judging from this first collection, Lanvin looks like it\u2019s finally found the man for the job.",

        "content": "The former manager recalls his whirlwind 70 days at Elland Road under Massimo Cellino, including transfer frustrations and \u2018a dysfunctional squad\u2019\nFrom a lavish stay in the Dolomites to 1am wake-up calls and dressing-downs at Elland Road courtesy of Massimo Cellino, there are so many bemusing and bewildering moments to reflect on that David Hockaday could write a book. So much so that, after an hour, it feels as if we have barely scratched the surface of his wild, white-knuckle 70-day ride at Leeds United.\nInfamously parachuted into one of the biggest jobs in the country almost five years ago after three covert meetings with the then owner, the now 61-year-old became the first victim of the chaos under the previous regime at Leeds.\nOther than his regret at failing to shore things up in a match at Bradford, when Leeds were leading with eight minutes to play in his final game, he is immensely proud to have followed managers such as Don Revie. Listening to Hockaday, who since 2016 has been head of male football at South Gloucestershire and Stroud college (SGS) on the outskirts of Bristol, speak brutally about his six matches in charge is staggering; he believes he has greater resources in terms of the staff at SGS than he did at Leeds.\n\u201cI was going into Championship games blind \u2013 it was crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [Marcelo] Bielsa going on about all this data, but we had nothing. We had just one match analyst, one strength and conditioning coach, and it just felt unprofessional. I was thrown to the dogs, just scrambling to get information on the opposition by phoning up other managers who had played the teams. I went in at ground zero. There was virtually nothing.\u201d\nHockaday recalls his squad looked at him as if to say \u201cwho are you?\u201d in their first team meeting, his previous job having been at Forest Green Rovers, and it was as big a mystery to him as to everybody else how he ended up at Leeds without applying for the job. He says he was wheeled out in front of the media before even signing a contract. \u201cIt was just surreal, so cloak-and-dagger,\u201d Hockaday says. \u201cI knew his record with managers [Cellino sacked 36 in 22 years at Cagliari] and I was thinking: \u2018Does he want to get an Italian-based manager in and get somebody who knows the English game to support him as the first-team coach? Or does he want an under-23s coach to bring through players, which is really what I\u2019m about.\u2019\n\u201cBut he said: \u2018I want you to be my head coach.\u2019 I said: \u2018What, like your manager?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Yes, I want you to be my coach.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK, interesting,\u2019 and I was sort of playing poker. I said: \u2018I can handle the coaching, that\u2019s not a problem,\u2019 but said: \u2018There\u2019s a few things we need to talk about.\u2019 He said: \u2018 You can recommend players but I will have the final say. You pick the team, you train them and I don\u2019t interfere with that\u2019 \u2013 and, to be fair, he never ever did.\u201d\nHockaday suggested several players but felt lumbered with a series of imports from Serie B. \u201cHe said: \u2018Go and get me a young, unproven striker that will score goals and we can sell on,\u2019\u201d Hockaday explains. \u201cI said: \u2018Andre Gray.\u2019 A few days later, he said: \u2018No, I\u2019ve spoken to him and his agent, he\u2019s too much.\u2019 I said: \u2018From Luton to Leeds United, and he\u2019s too much?\u2019 Later in the season, he goes and gets [Mirco] Antenucci for millions of pounds.\u201d\nThe signings of Gaetano Berardi \u2013 \u201cwho was kung fu-ing everybody and getting sent off every game\u201d \u2013 and Giuseppe Bellusci \u2013 \u201che thought he was a hard man but was an absolute pussy\u201d \u2013 compounded Hockaday\u2019s frustration and he says he was shut down after recommending Virgil van Dijk, then of Celtic, as well as Craig Cathcart and Mark Hudson as preferred centre-back options. A move for Conor Coady, available on a free, never made it past Cellino either. \u201cFlipping heck,\u201d Hockaday says, asked about what might have been. \u201cDon\u2019t make me cry. I was scratching my head being told \u2018no\u2019 about those I had recommended while we were getting in these Italian-based players who were nowhere near it and, I have got to say, that\u2019s what killed me.\u201d Hockaday fought to convince Cellino, who he says liked to be referred to as \u201cMr President\u201d, to pay for food after training. \u201cI basically had an under-23s\u2019 team and a lot of disenchanted senior players. It was the most dysfunctional squad I\u2019ve ever played with, trained with, coached \u2013 whatever. It was a terrible environment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they are doing with the swimming pool at Thorp Arch now but you know when you see the westerns with all the tumbleweed? It was like that, because none of it was being used. It was a massive facility that was \u2018too expensive to run\u2019.\u201d\nThe real fun and games, Hockaday says, began when they returned to Yorkshire. He and the coach Neil Sullivan took the goalkeeper Marco Silvestri away from the rest of the squad to work on his kicking. \u201cI found out quite quickly that the Italians reported back to the president \u2026 I had a phone call from Cellino to say: \u2018Get yourself down to Elland Road.\u2019 I get in there and he says: \u2018What are you doing, embarrassing my goalkeeper?\u2019 I said: \u2018Right, hang on a minute, what\u2019s he like with the ball at his feet?\u2019 He went: \u2018He\u2019s not that good.\u2019 I said: \u2018Does he need to work on it?\u2019 He said: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 I said: \u2018Do you know what we\u2019ve done? We\u2019ve taken him to another field and worked on it.\u2019 He said: \u2018Good work, well done.\u2019 That sort of thing went on every day.\u201d\nHockaday is able to laugh now. \u201cHe [Cellino] used to ring me every day, and at weird times \u2013 at midnight, 1am, all sorts. I used to pick up every call, which was a bit silly of me. He said: \u2018Coach.\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes, Mr President.\u2019 And he went: \u2018You\u2019re not a good English coach.\u2019 I was thinking: \u2018Oh shit.\u2019 But then he said: \u2018You\u2019re a good Italian coach, three times [training] a day. I love it. Keep it going.\u2019 He had spies and they were reporting back to him \u2026 I was incredibly grateful for the opportunity so I was always going to swallow some of what he was going to throw at me. He wanted a vulnerable, if you like, good coach. He told me he\u2019d let me down and I have talked to him a couple of times since, when he has phoned out of the blue.\u201d\nSince joining SGS, Hockaday has enjoyed great success. He recognises the value of education; he would have read business at Sheffield University had he not signed for Blackpool, and he studied civil engineering and accounting during his playing days. The defender Kasper Lopata, who joined Brighton, and the striker Antoine Semenyo, who signed for Bristol City, are the most salient success stories, and Saikou Janneh, also signed by City, is another export of the full-time programme. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave a legacy here,\u201d Hockaday says. \u201cI\u2019m going to build something incredible.\u201d\nAs for Leeds, he smiles. \u201cIt was a brilliant experience, I learned a lot about myself. \u2018Can I handle the shit?\u2019 Yes, I can. \u2018Can I handle players at that level?\u2019 I think so. I\u2019m such a massive Leeds fan now; I love them to bits. It was only three months but it is a massive part of my life.\u201d",

At the other end there are no policies whatsoever in place at government or local authority level to provide truly affordable homes for rent for the 79,880 homeless families in temporary accommodation. Their number rose by 65% from 2010 while Persimmon\u2019s profit tripled from 2013. The condition of the temporary homes is often a disgrace. People can be forced to move several times over 10 years of homelessness, sometimes via a homeless hostel, while landlords either default on their mortgage or take their profit from a speculative buy to let. Forced moves disrupt the education of more than 120,000 children. These low-income families are at the mercy of landlords, who can evict without reason, and of councils, who can compel them to accept an offer of permanent housing in a private tenancy at rents they cannot afford. It is more of a housing emergency than a housing crisis.

More to the point, when will the government take action to lift struggling families out of poverty? How many more studies do we need before the fact that 4 million children live in households that can\u2019t afford decent food is treated as an emergency? Why are the concerns of trade unionists over low pay and job security, which keep even working parents in poverty, ignored?

        "content": "The latest instalment in the series includes a warm-up podcast by Wata Igarashi, optimistic house by Beautiful Swimmers and beautiful bangers from Mixpak\u2019s the Large\nFrom its early 2000s pop success to spawning grime and bassline, plus multiple mainstream resurgences thanks to the likes of Disclosure and Jorja Smith, it\u2019s clear that UK garage music refuses to ever truly die. This is the case Conducta makes on the Kiwi Manifesto: an hour-long showcase of new, unreleased UKG breezers from the scene\u2019s latest crop of producers, mixed by the Bristolian himself. Across 30 tracks, he packs in sensual R&B, piano house anthems and twinkling melodies over swinging bass rumbles. Few dancefloors can resist the charms of soulful UKG done with its heart on its sleeve, and great things can be expected of the scene in 2019 if this new wave is anything to go by.\n\u201cThings will be better in future times,\u201d is the assuring motto of Future Times, a label headed up by Max D of Beautiful Swimmers. Ari Goldman forms the other half of the Swimmers, a DC duo known for extroverted house that encompasses percussive breaks, funk and Baltimore club. Together they\u2019ve spent a decade creating a springy, sunny sound. Their mix Extended Family maintains the good-time feels, dressing luscious groovers in a colourful 1980s sheen.\nThe early 2010s were a momentous time for the UK underground. Mysterious experimental duo Hype Williams sat in the midst of it, tongues firmly in cheeks. Despite their mystique, however, their music has remained grounded in the everyday, mundane to the point of absurdity. This newly released live set by Lolina \u2013 formerly known as Inga Copeland, of Hype Williams \u2013 is very much in the vein of her earlier work: over austere beats and guttural drones, she sings of smoking behind petrol pumps, driving stick and musing on how dark the streets are. She bends disintegrating samples, cacophonous whirs and disharmony into a pulsating narrative.\nLong before she took up DJing, Spanish sound artist JASSS fell in love with all sorts of music, from punk and hardcore to free jazz, field recordings and industrial \u2013\u00a0and it shows in her instinctively intrepid sets. Having departed Spain for the Netherlands, she eventually ended up in Berlin, where she scored films, released productions and mixed records. Now she\u2019s a resident at clubland monolith Berghain\u2019s newer, more experimental venue S\u00e4ule, so it\u2019s no surprise that her offering for the Dekmantel series is well tuned for the dancefloor. Sinewy EBM and stark techno trade blows with house flair and a touch of grime on this full-throttle ride.\nAs the A&R of the Brooklyn-based label Mixpak, the Large\u2019s ear for bangers is only matched by her talents on the decks. Her mixtape drops are always a special occasion, wrapping up riddims for party moods with a pace-switching style of DJing. She lays a foundation for the 54-minute maelstrom with Mixpak\u2019s Dre Skull, a version of J Hus\u2019s Bouff Daddy that features Popcaan, and the Vybz Kartel tune the mix is named for. She then packs Jadakiss and Mariah, Dinamarca and a Jennifer Lopez instrumental into the first 10 minutes to complete the lively (unruly, even) opening salvo. It doesn\u2019t stop at dancehall and R&B \u2013 there\u2019s ghetto house, Jersey club and Afrobeats stirred in for good measure.\nTunisia-via-Berlin DJ Cera Khin is best known for LazyTapes, her cassette and vinyl label that is quickly establishing itself as the go-to place for the murk and dub of atmospheric hardcore. Her FACT mix opens with an ambient production of her own making. Inspired by a tour that stopped in Tokyo, it references the city\u2019s juxtaposition of shadowy, cramped alleyways and behemoth neon glow. Searing drones and throbbing breaks set the tone for a retro-futuristic venture on acid-house trips and down rave-y black holes. Cera Khin captures a range of moods, as wonder curls into unease and curiosity blossoms into euphoria.\nWith releases on the Bunker, Midgar and Bitta \u2013 labels based around techno hotspots New York, Berlin and Chiba (on the outskirts of Tokyo) respectively \u2013 Wata Igarashi\u2019s psychedelic sound has found admirers around the world. (All the more admirable is that he composes and DJs internationally while holding down a day job.) The beauty of his intricate style is exhibited in this warm-up podcast for Japan\u2019s Rainbow Disco Club festival. Its tempo is best suited to deep introspection, lulling with patient pulses from the likes of Junes and hypnotising with pitched-down Terrence Dixon. Rarely does an hour pass so easily.",

        "content": "As you say, the cement component of concrete generates much CO2 (Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth, 26 February). Roughly 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of cement. Or 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 for a small-sized plant. Cement consumption per capita is between 50kg and 2,000kg per person per year, depending on the phase of development of the country and the availability of alternative building materials. Taking an unholy average, each member of the human population is responsible, through their fondness for a built environment, for roughly 500kg per year of CO2 from cement. What you forgot to point out is that human metabolism contributes roughly 300kg per person per year of CO2 through exhaled breath. Perhaps more in Westminster, the offices of newspapers and the vicinity of sports grounds. The annual US dollar turnover of the worldwide cement industry, by the by, is only 60% of that of Walmart.\nSuffice to say that the most destructive material on Earth is not concrete. It\u2019s not oil or coal either. The most destructive material on Earth is human flesh. The clue is in the anthropo part of anthropogenic climate change. If you really want to save the planet a radical cull is required, but if you\u2019re too tender for that, worry not. The Verhulst model for population growth suggests that the adjustment will happen of itself.Peter Anderson(Consulting engineer to the cement industry), Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire\n In George Monbiot\u2019s manifesto for climate strikers (Opinion, 20 February), he suggests: \u201cThe world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought.\u201d And he proposes the restoration of the \u201cbenign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive\u201d.\nUnfortunately, he\u2019s completely missed one of the main issues driving climate change, namely the huge increase in the number of people living on this planet. When he was born in 1963 the world population was 3.2 billion. Today, just 56 years later, it\u2019s around 7.7 billion. It\u2019s precisely the success of our thriving human population that is causing untold damage around the world to the \u201cother species\u201d he mentions. We\u2019re adding around 81 million people a year to the world\u2019s population, and climate change is just one of the consequences of massive population growth. It\u2019s no good just reducing carbon emissions; we also need to have fewer children. This will be the fastest way to save our planet.\nAnd politicians, economists and businesspeople must stop talking about \u201cgrowth\u201d being a good thing. We urgently need to start planning to decrease our population growth and our economies and world travel, and put a halt to flagrant spending on throwaway goods etc. Only then will our (far fewer) grandchildren have a better life.Jonathan CockburnHewelsfield, Gloucestershire\n Jonathan Watts does us an important service (Decline in biodiversity \u2018threatens food crisis\u2019, 22 February) in bringing to our attention the comprehensive UN report on the state of the world\u2019s biodiversity with respect to our need for food, and the many factors threatening food production.\nToo often, particular threats to humanity are identified, attracting justified concern and attention, when they themselves have a more fundamental upstream cause. Climate change is driven by climate changers, all 7.7 billion of us, increasing at more than 80 million annually. Each new soul will need additional food, energy, housing, education and health services, and clean water and air in an increasingly polluted world.\nWe have to talk about population. Charities such as Population Matters, for whom Sir David Attenborough and several other scientists are patrons, show how entirely non-coercive and proven ways are available for the reduction and reversal of population growth urgently required. When women have access to education and contraception, they will not choose to have more children than they can support.

        "content": "Scientists develop GM strain that can produce cannabinoid compounds with addition of sugar\nScientists in California have developed a strain of yeast that can be used to brew cannabis extract rather than beer.\nWith just the addition of sugar, the genetically modified yeast fermented to produce pure cannabinoid compounds including mind-altering THC and the non-psychoactive CBD, which is used medically to treat conditions including chronic pain and childhood epilepsy.\nThe scientists, who have already launched a cannabinoid brewing company, say the process is considerably cheaper, safer and more environmentally friendly than extracting the compounds from marijuana plants.\nJay Keasling, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of California Berkeley, was the lead author of the study. \u201cThe process is just like brewing beer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feed the yeast sugar and they produce the cannabinoid you want to produce, rather than ethanol, which they would normally produce.\u201d\nThe designer yeast also yielded novel cannabinoid compounds or chemicals that exist only in tiny quantities in marijuana plants, raising the possibility that brewing could revolutionise the production of these substances and expand their potential medical applications.\nIn conventional brewing, yeast produces enzymes that naturally turn sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the souped-up version, the scientists inserted more than a dozen genes into the yeast\u2019s DNA, many of them copies of genes used by the marijuana plant to synthesise cannabinoids.\nThe genes pump out enzymes, which act as catalysts in a chain of chemical reactions, starting out with sugar and leading, eventually, to a chemical called cannabigerolic acid, described as \u201cthe mother of all cannabinoids\u201d. A range of cannabis compounds, including THC and CBD, can be derived from this acid.\nPinpointing the exact mix of genetic insertions that needed to be made to the yeast was a complex and lengthy process. But now that the cannabinoid-producing yeast has been created, it can be cultivated in the same way as ordinary brewers\u2019 yeast. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of the process,\u201d said Keasling.\nCannabis and its extracts, including THC, which produces the high people feel when they smoke a joint, represent a multibillion-dollar business nationwide. Medications containing THC have been approved by regulators in several countries, including the US, while CBD, or cannabidiol, has been approved as a treatment for childhood epileptic seizures and is being investigated as a therapy for conditions including anxiety, Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain.\nHowever, medical research on the more than 100 other chemicals in marijuana has been difficult, because the chemicals occur in tiny quantities, making them hard to extract from the plant. Brewing could provide inexpensive, purer sources of these chemicals, making it possible to study their effects in detail for the first time. \u201cSome of these could be blockbuster drugs,\u201d Keasling said.\nIn the lab, the scientists used flasks to grow the yeast, but plan to scale up production to use large stainless steel tanks that are typically used in a brewery. Keasling and colleagues have formed a company called Demetrix, which they anticipate will be able to commercially supply small quantities of product in the next year and large quantities within three years.\nThe team said that using yeast would be a \u201cgreener\u201d way to cultivate cannabis, which is a water-hungry crop and is often farmed using heavy quantities of pesticides and fertilisers. Indoor growing under lights and with ventilation fans uses a lot of energy \u2013 one study estimated that California\u2019s cannabis industry accounted for 3% of the state\u2019s energy usage.\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature.",

I believe they should act as critical friends in supporting the pope\u2019s attempts to prevent and deal with child abuse. The pope has made some brave strides, and some missteps. He believed the apparently sincere and heartfelt protestations of innocence of the Chilean bishops, and reacted with anger and decisive action when he found they had been lying \u2013 he sacked them and apologised to the victims. A misstep and an apology can be a powerful message.\nThe pope has now made the common mistake of implying that since child abuse happens in all spheres, including the family, it is hard to prevent and we must be patient. This tactic is commonly seen as \u2013 and often is \u2013 a distraction from the main, urgent tasks that can and must be undertaken now. The RC church \u2013 and all religious bodies \u2013 should see their role as leading the way in effective child protection, rather than being dragged kicking and screaming towards decent practice. It may be a long task, but the essential first steps include use of secular justice systems, which are the fruit of long experience, careful legislation and good professional practice.\nThe pope has already said that perpetrators and those who protect them should be subject to secular criminal justice systems. He must therefore urge his representative in Britain, Archbishop Edward Adams, to stop refusing to hand over crucial evidence about clerical abuse to the child sexual abuse inquiry. The Catholic church is not a democracy; yet, if every British Catholic wrote, emailed, texted or phoned Archbishop Adams with the demand that he act justly in this matter, I believe he would feel called to comply.Hilary CashmanAuthor, Christianity and Child Sexual Abuse, 1993\n Any person who is not speaking out over the crisis surrounding the Catholic ban on contraception is complicit in another tragedy. While women in rich countries ignore the ban, those in poorer ones are forced to have more children than they want or can afford. Their governments find it hard to pay for the education of the rising numbers of children, even though it would help them out of poverty. The problem will become increasingly acute as climate change makes agriculture less productive and lack of food more likely. It is difficult to see the pope\u2019s otherwise very welcome emphasis on reducing poverty as anything other than window dressing when his teaching makes poverty harder to prevent and food shortages more likely.Helen HaranSt Albans, Hertfordshire\n While sharing Joanna Moorhead\u2019s astonishment at the silence maintained by lay Catholics over the abuse scandals, I think I can explain why many continue to attend mass and \u201cparrot prayers\u201d. It is because they, unlike many in the institutional church, base their faith upon the teachings of Jesus Christ in the Gospel and not upon the monolithic structure that is often mistaken for \u201cthe church\u201d. We, the people, are the church; it is not a building or an institution, it is us and our anger is entirely justified. But our anger should never blind us to the many hard-working good priests who quietly and faithfully represent the best of Christianity. Sadly, we seldom hear about them.Frances DawbarnLancaster\n Most Guardian readers will appreciate that thanks to the ecumenical movement and united studies of disputed texts, no Christian would ever claim that Jesus Christ was \u201cthe founder of the Catholic church\u201d, as he is described in Joanna Moorhead\u2019s article.Rev Dr Donald W NorwoodOxford\n Dr Marcella McCarthy (Letters, 25 February) points out that other organisations, along with the church, are attractive to paedophiles, but there are very few institutions which require, for non-doctrinal reasons, new entrants, often teenagers, to forgo natural human relationships and yet require an understanding of compassion and love; prohibit, for liturgical reasons, the ordination of women and therefore a role for half the population; and have had quite such an institutionalised and systemic child abuse problem.\nDr McCarthy is correct that the causes of child abuse may be complex and extend beyond merely abolishing celibacy, but suggesting, in the light of recent experience and disclosure, that such an unreformed and unrepresentative institution can now provide effective safeguarding is itself dangerously mistaken.Alistair CraigLondon\n Since the early 1990s I have worked with fellow clergy promoting professional development and education. My experience as one responsible for clergy support is that \u201ca slow process of systematic reform of laws and a change of hearts\u201d, to quote your editorial (23 February), has begun. While the awareness of the importance of safeguarding in my small part of the UK has increased, far more needs to be done globally.\nTo Illustrate my point, I work alongside a full-time safeguarding officer. All our clergy have to attend frequent and regular conferences on safeguarding against sexual abuse of children and vulnerable adults, and they are barred from working as clergy if they miss the sessions. They are increasingly aware of good practice, which is supported by a developing set of guidelines. We are also trained in identifying signs of abuse, grooming, and the legal procedure of notification to the police. I have also developed a practice of professional supervision for clergy which aims at enhancing personal accountability in all areas of work and personal development.\nWhile serious mistakes have been made both in the UK and more widely, I do feel that a slow process of change for the better has begun, in the Catholic Church and that we are learning from our mistakes. But we can still do better.Canon Paul TownsendVicar general, Catholic diocese of Portsmouth\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Landmark case looks to have Georgina Challen\u2019s murder conviction overturned under new domestic abuse law\nA woman who killed her husband in a hammer attack has begun a \u201clandmark\u201d appeal to have her murder conviction overturned in a case set to test new laws on domestic abuse and coercive control.\n Georgina Challen, known as Sally, killed her car-dealer husband, Richard Challen, 61, in August 2010 after 40 years of being controlled and humiliated by him, it is claimed.\n The appeal to get her murder conviction substituted with manslaughter follows a high-profile campaign by her two sons, David, 31 and James, 35, and supported by Justice for Women.\n The appeal is the first time the defence of coercive and controlling behaviour will be used in a murder trial. Coercive control was only recognised in law as a form of domestic abuse in 2015.\n The court of appeal was told that \u201cfresh evidence\u201d on the nature of coercive control not available at Challen\u2019s 2011 trial would enable a jury to come to a different verdict.\n Clare Wade QC, for Challen, 65, told three appeal court judges: \u201cIt has never been argued that this legislative change of itself affords a ground of appeal. Rather it is our growing understanding of domestic abuse and in particular the mechanism and impact of coercive and controlling behaviour which is significant.\u201d\n The court was filled to overflowing, with the public gallery packed and many more unable to get in, forcing the case to be moved mid-hearing to a larger court.\nMore than 20 supporters waving \u201cFree Sally\u201d placards gathered outside the court. Challen appeared via video link from Bronzefield prison in Surrey.\nAt her 2011 trial at Guildford crown court, Challen, who met her husband when she was 15, admitted killing him at their Claygate home in Surrey, but denied murder, claiming diminished responsibility.\nChallen had hit her husband 20 times with a hammer, and left a note on his body saying: \u201cI love you, Sally.\u201d She then went to Beachy Head, where she was talked out of a suicide by suicide counsellors.\nThe prosecution case was that it was the actions of a jealous wife who suspected infidelity. Challen was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 22 years, later reduced to 18 years.\nProf Evan Stark, an American academic expert on the theory of coercive control, told the court of appeal that \u201ccoercive control\u201d was designed to subjugate and dominate, not merely to hurt.\n\u201cIt achieves compliance by making victims afraid, depriving them of their rights, resources, and liberties without which they cannot defend themselves, escape, refuse demands or resist.\u201d\n\u201cIt produces a hostage-like condition of entrapment,\u201d he added, saying it was \u201cnot widely understood\u201d.\nMajor elements could include physical violence, sexual coercion, intimidation and isolation \u2013 cutting victims off from family, friends, co-workers, \u201cso the only sense of reality you get comes from the person who is abusing you\u201d, he said.\n Gaslighting \u2013 when the abusers \u201cplay little tricks to make the person they are living with think they are going crazy\u201d \u2013 was also an element. It included such things as hiding car keys, turning the gas on when they thought it was off, little things that disappear and reappear in strange places, \u201cso that over time a person comes to believe they are losing their mind and sense of reality\u201d, he said.\nCoercive control also involved financial control, he said, \u201cusing money as a weapon\u201d.\nEvents taken together \u201cform such an insidious course of conduct the likes of which we are only just now beginning to appreciate\u201d and which had \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d effects.\n The outcome for the abused partner \u201cwas subjugation and loss of autonomy and a mounting sense of being trapped and with no way out\u201d. Some victims \u201cadapt defensively\u201d forming a \u201ctraumatic bond\u201d with their abuser, Stark said.\n He added that \u201ccoercive control only replaced domestic violence as a primary form of abuse when women gained some sort of equality in the home\u201d.\n Questioned by Caroline Carberry, QC, for the crown, Stark agreed he had never met Challen or interviewed her, and was not medically qualified.\n Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Tim Exworthy, who gave evidence at Challen\u2019s 2011 trial, said he had assessed her when she was in custody pre-trial.\n He said she had described the marriage as \u201cgenerally good\u201d but she had spoken about her husband\u2019s infidelity. Of their sex life, she said \u201che dictated when sexual activity would take place and it was always on his terms\u201d. She described him using anal rape as a \u201cpunishment\u201d and she thought it would \u201ckeep him happy \u201cand that he would \u201clove her more\u201d.\n Exworthy said he concluded that Challen had a \u201cdepressive disorder\u201d. He told the court that at the time of her trial he was not aware of the concept of coercive control, though agreed that he did elicit responses from Challen that related to control.\nThe appeal, before Lady Justice Hallett, Mr Justice Sweeney and Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, is expected to last two days.\nIf Challen, who has served eight years in prison, is successful, she wants her murder conviction quashed and substituted with one of voluntary manslaughter. The crown would argue for a retrial.\nConsultant forensic psychiatrist Paul Gilluley, who assessed Challen in 2010 and gave evidence at her trial, told the appeal court that it was his opinion \u201cat the relevant time she was not suffering from any mental disorder\u201d or personality disorder.\nConsultant forensic psychiatrist, Prof Gwen Adshead, who assessed Challen post-conviction in 2015, concluded she suffered borderline personality disorder, and at the time of the killing suffered a severe mood disorder. This could have been masked because of the effect of coercive control, the judges were told.\n Carberry, for the crown, said: \u201cThere is nothing in the fresh evidence which would render the jury\u2019s verdict unsafe.\u201d The hammer attack was set against the background of \u201cweeks of stalking him online, listening to his phone messages and having the neighbour spy on him,\u201d she said, adding that Challen had been monitoring her husband\u2019s mobile records over eight or nine years.\nIn police interviews, Challen, who worked for the Police Federation in Surrey, said she had \u201cjust snapped\u201d because her husband was \u201clying to me ... still gonna see his woman\u201d, and because he had asked her to sign a post-nuptial agreement.\n \u201cThe whole thing was a game, let\u2019s get one over on Sally again,\u201d she said in one police interview. \u201cSigning a post-nuptial that was just a way of him having a control that he could carry on doing what he wanted ... I leave him I wouldn\u2019t get very much. It was just his way of controlling me.\u201d\n The case continues on Thursday when counsel will make final legal submissions.",

In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone.\nMr Trump put Mr Stone on the speakerphone. Mr Stone told Mr Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange [of Wikileaks] and that Mr Assange told Mr Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nMr Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be great\u201d.\nI lied to Congress about when Mr Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false \u2013 our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates.\nIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.\nYou need to know that Mr Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.\nTo be clear: Mr Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\nHe asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did\u2026\nMr Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too \u2013 without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public.\nI am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 \u2013 when he was President of the United States \u2013 pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me \u2013 the word used by Mr Trump\u2019s TV lawyer \u2013 for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check instalments that was paid throughout the year \u2013 while he was President.\nThe President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.\nThe country has seen Mr Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \u201cshitholes\u201d.\nIn private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u201cshithole\u201d. This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.\nWhile we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\nI\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.\nAs I mentioned, I\u2019m giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr Trump\u2019s direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr Trump\u2019s grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission.\nMr Trump is a cheat.\nIt was my experience that Mr Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\nMr Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon.\nThe portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organisation, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself.\nAnd it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it.\nMr Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.\nMr Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.\nHe finished the conversation with the following comment. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d\nDonald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation \u2013 only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.\nMr Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \u201cgreatest infomercial in political history\u201d.\nHe never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign \u2013 for him \u2013 was always a marketing opportunity.\nFollow live updates and analysis of Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony.\nGet a new perspective on the US.

The price for many life-saving drugs, such as insulin, has more than doubled in recent years, forcing people to resort to increasingly desperate measures for medicine. Meyers showed a clip from a recent NBC News segment that followed a group of Americans as they crossed the border into Tijuana to buy far cheaper insulin.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where we are as a country right now: Trump\u2019s trying to build a wall to prevent outsiders from coming in, while Americans are forced to cross the border into Mexico just to get affordable medication,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cHey, if Mexico won\u2019t pay for the wall, maybe Pfizer will.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the president\u2019s promise, in a Rose Garden speech from May of last year, that he would take on \u201cthe tangled web of special interests\u201d, who, he noted, were not in attendance. The claim was \u201ca nice sentiment\u201d, said Meyers, \u201cbut unfortunately most of the people there do take massive campaign donations from pharmaceutical companies. They are the special interests.\n\u201cAre you having trouble seeing them? If so, maybe it\u2019s time you asked your doctor about Lotemax,\u201d Meyers continued, slipping into the voice of a pharmaceutical commercial. \u201cLotemax: so you can clearly see that you\u2019re full of shit.\u201d\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah prepared for Wednesday\u2019s televised testimony before Congress by former Trump fixer and \u201cclinically depressed Goodfella\u201d Michael Cohen. Reports swirled on Tuesday that Cohen, who served for years as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, would testify to Trump\u2019s pattern of dishonesty and racist comments.\n\u201cGood Lord, this is huge. Michael Cohen is going to testify under oath that President Trump is a liar, a cheater, a womanizer and a racist,\u201d Noah deadpanned. \u201cWhat other bombshells is he going to drop? Is he also going to tell us that Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t die of natural causes? That Double Stuf Oreos are just regular Oreos with more stuff?\u201d\nTo be fair, Cohen could potentially prove that Trump was involved in specific criminal acts, including while he was president, which \u201cwould be big news if it turned out that Trump stopped playing golf and watching TV long enough to commit crimes\u201d, said Noah.\nWhile one of Trump\u2019s most loyal associates breaks rank, his family is still toeing the party line: Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, gave an interview to Fox News in which she said that most Americans want to work rather than be guaranteed an income. Noah called BS. \u201cIvanka Trump says the thing she\u2019s learned in life is that people want to work for what they get? Really? The woman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 just says: \u2018Daddy, I need job now\u2019?\u201d\nHe also wasn\u2019t buying her claim that people don\u2019t want free things. \u201cPeople love free shit \u2026 I\u2019ve been to Costco \u2013 I\u2019ve seen people put on disguises to get a second free sample of Bagel Bites.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all under the careful watch of Mike Pence today,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged at the top of his show, as Trump traveled to Vietnam \u2013 \u201creporting for duty only about 50 years late\u201d \u2013 to meet with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\nThe two were reportedly meeting for a small dinner, although Kimmel was suspicious of that claim. \u201cAlready I don\u2019t believe it \u2013 neither one of those two have ever eaten a small dinner,\u201d he joked.\nMeanwhile, back in the US, Cohen prepared to testify against his former boss. Despite the 12-hour time difference between DC and Hanoi, Trump was still, according to some reports, planning to stay up late to watch Cohen\u2019s testimony. \u201cSo that should put him in the right mood to talk denuclearization,\u201d Kimmel said.\nFinally, Kimmel touched on the national emergency declaration, which the House voted to officially reject on Tuesday \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t meet the legal standard known as being an emergency situation\u201d, said Kimmel. The rebuke might even continue, with some Republican support, through the Senate \u2013 \u201ca huge embarrassment for Trump\u201d, Kimmel noted, \u201cif he was capable of feeling shame, which he is not\u201d.",

I don\u2019t like [these images] or others. That\u2019s why I think that political leaders have a duty to work to ensure that the conditions don\u2019t arise for these images.\u201d\nOver the course of 100 minutes of often tetchy testimony, the former premier repeatedly defended his government\u2019s decision to take the unprecedented step of using the Spanish constitution to sack Puigdemont and his administration and assume direct control of the region.\n\u201cI think we were careful,\u201d he told the court, saying he had always been abundantly clear to both Puigdemont and his predecessor, Artur Mas, that the Spanish government would never accept a unilateral referendum.\n\u201cThey knew full well from the first day I met Mr Mas that I would not allow a referendum that would eliminate national sovereignty and the unity of Spain,\u201d he said.\nRajoy led the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) government between 2011 and 2018. He was eventually forced from office in June last year when the opposition socialists brought a successful no-confidence motion against him after several former PP members were convicted of corruption.\nNine of those on trial \u2013 who include the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell and two influential grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and the misuse of public funds.\nDefence lawyers are seeking to undermine the charges of rebellion, which under Spanish law is defined as \u201crevolting violently and publicly\u201d. They argue that none of those charged with the offence engaged in violence during the pursuit of independence. Giving evidence two weeks ago, Junqueras said he was a \u201cpolitical prisoner \u2026 on trial for my ideas\u201d.\nThe trial, which is expected to last three months, continues.",

        "content": "Bernard Nevill\u2019s acute sensibilities as a textile designer, educator and collector had a discreet yet powerful effect on more than half a century of British fashion and decor. Nevill, who has died aged 88, taught many star designers, encouraged serious applied arts scholarship, and the houses he restored and stuffed with pantechnicons of purchases \u2013 he was a hoarder of antiques \u2013 caught the imagination of people who never knew his name.\nDo you remember Uncle Monty\u2019s London home in the film Withnail and I (1987), walls layered in art, sofas smothered in exotic cushions? That was a corner of just one room in Nevill\u2019s house in Chelsea, and the set-dressers had to shift things out to make space for the actors.\nAs a lecturer at the Central School of Art and Design, 1957-60, and at the Royal College of Art and St Martin\u2019s School of Art, 1959-74, Nevill led his students to museums and galleries, and taught them about the creators of good taste over the previous century. There was no academic history of fashion then, and few publications; Nevill did original research for the information he passed on. Those students initially turned their noses up at past fashions, but Nevill was gifted at inspiring interest, and turned them on to the aesthetic vocabularies of William Morris, the pre-Raphaelites, the Ballets Russes; they became the art and craft-conscious designers, including Ossie Clark and Zandra Rhodes, of post-1965 British fashion.\nA lecturer\u2019s income hardly supported Nevill\u2019s collecting habits, so he also designed freelance, and in 1961 was recruited to the London department store Liberty and Co as design consultant, then design director. It was hoped he would sharpen the blunted artistic edge of Liberty\u2019s famous printed textiles. Besides knowing about the visual past, he was keenly aware of what was about to happen next, what movie, curiosity found at the Portobello Road market, or museum exhibition, would provoke creativity.\nFrom the 1960s into the 1980s, printed textiles were a major medium for fashion in clothes and homes, a fast-changing way to enrich a simple garment or stark curtain. Nevill\u2019s Liberty collections came out of the decorative encyclopedia in his head, referencing Hungarian embroidery, Javanese sculpture, Ottoman ceramics, 1920s stained glass and Tudor brocades in a Tate Gallery portrait exhibition; those who could not afford a single yard of the stuff still learned about then unknown cultures from photographs of the clothes.\nYves St Laurent and other Parisian houses bought his prints by the bolt, as did Nevill\u2019s former students. He was envious that the 60s young had immediate access to fame and fortune, and he dressed as they did \u2013 only better. Although he was an aesthete, not a dandy, his pleasure was in commissioning clothes, getting a tweed specially woven or choosing a shade of suede for a shoe.\nHe was born in Highgate, north London, son of RG Nevill, which is all he revealed of his parents, except to admit he had rejected them for their poor taste and lack of interest in the arts. He was just as evasive about his education, saying only that he had been tutored until 15. He did reminisce about great-aunts in Kingsbridge, Devon, with whom he lived during the second world war, as their household formed his own tastes.\nIronic use of Victorian design had been a sophisticated fad since the 1920s; Nevill, though, was exposed to the genuine articles, and there was no mockery in his relationship with 19th, and early 20th, century art and design. His lifetime of addictive collecting began when those eras were going cheap in junk shops. \u201cI am a Victorian, I know that I was born too late,\u201d he said.\nAfter the war, Nevill determined to go to art college, and a friend introduced him to Muriel Pemberton, who taught dress design and fashion drawing at St Martin\u2019s, which accepted him, aged 16, as its youngest student. He later studied at the Royal College of Art, where Madge Garland was inventing formal fashion education, teaching history of dress, technical construction and an understanding of the clothing industry.\nNeither institution offered a way into the business. As Nevill complained, London fashion circa 1951 had no interest in the young as customers or employees: \u201cYou had to be 44, a member of the Incorporated Society of Fashion Designers \u2026 Nobody would look at you because being young was not interesting.\u201d He taught briefly at Shoreditch College, sketched for glossy magazines, helped with clothes for the movie Genevieve (1954) and designed unusually accurate Edwardian servants\u2019 wear for The Admirable Crichton (1957), before being asked to lecture at Central.\nAfter he left Liberty\u2019s in 1972, Nevill designed textiles for another 30 years. His dress prints for Cantoni of Italy, Unitika of Japan and KBC of Germany were as personal as handwriting, while his furnishing fabrics for Pierre Frey and Boussac were often learned and sympathetic pastiches of the past. His 1981 English Country House collection for Sekers influenced the shabby, cluttered tone of 80s interiors, and many period television series since.\nNevill lamented that he would have to work perpetually at design for the money, because, besides extraordinary books, textiles, clothes, furniture and objects, he collected buildings, and architectural salvage. The first was West House, with its shy brick facade and secretive front door tucked in a corner of Glebe Place, Chelsea, bought from the Church Commissioners in 1976 for \u00a367,000; Philip Webb, William Morris\u2019s pet architect, had designed it in 1868 for the artist George Boyce. Nevill removed all later accretions and crammed its 15 rooms with acquisitions, many vast (his favourite word), as massivity had fetched very low prices in the 1950s and 60s. He had paid only a few pounds for gigantic bookcases and leather sofas from the Conservative Club in St James\u2019s, and retrieved a majestic carpet, free, from a skip.\nHe fossicked anywhere: visiting a framer\u2019s shop on Lavender Hill, Battersea, in 1962, to see if any interesting artwork had been discarded to release frames for sale, he spotted Frederic Leighton\u2019s 1895 masterpiece Flaming June, priced at \u00a360, but had to turn away as he was overdrawn at the bank. Collecting was \u201ca disease\u201d, he said; he told friends he had to rescue beautiful objects even when he had no use for them, as he wanted to save them from death.\nThe location hire fee for Withnail and I funded his collections, too. Nevill loathed the film as being \u201ctoo near the bone\u201d; its director, Bruce Robinson, and stars tried to work when Nevill was out shopping, as he was hungry for company and fussy about props. West House counted as his town house; in 1977 he had also bought a country house, a half-ruined stable block surviving from centuries of demolition and rebuilding on the Fonthill estate in Wiltshire. Restoration was never finished there, or at West House, since Nevill\u2019s excitement was in acquiring, planning, planting and rearranging. Another delivery of architectural salvage was forever scheduled: carved staircase, marble fireplace, fragments of a swimming pool.\nWhen Nevill fell ill at 80, his accumulations were released back into the world. West House sold for over \u00a320m in 2011, and most of its contents were auctioned, with special catalogue mention for those in Withnail and I. Then he parted with Fonthill and took only the most perfect possessions to a new home, a flat in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. Crates of wonders were parked in various places until his death.\nHe was didactic, opinionated (seldom wrong) and entertaining, and knew more than anybody about the secret lives of things.\n Bernard Richard Nevill, designer and educator, born 24 September 1930; died 30 January 2019",

        "content": "Trump\u2019s ex-fixer hints Mueller may have proof of coordination with Russia and again alleges campaign finance violations\nMichael Cohen on Wednesday delivered a sharp warning to Donald Trump and the Republican party that the president faces legal and political peril on at least two fronts.\nFirst, the Trump-Russia investigation.\nCohen became the first Trump associate to allege that, in 2016, Trump knew in advance that his eldest son, Donald Jr, was meeting Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2013 and that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from Democrats by Russian operatives.\nMoreover, Cohen hinted that Robert Mueller, the special counsel currently wrapping up a two-year inquiry into whether Trump\u2019s team coordinated with Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, may have proof.\nCohen was asked by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat forced to resign as party chairwoman over the WikiLeaks disclosures, how they could corroborate his explosive allegations, which are based on remarks he says he overheard in Trump\u2019s office.\n\u201cI suspect that the special counsel\u2019s office and other government agencies have the information you\u2019re seeking,\u201d Cohen said. Trump denied both allegations in his written answers to questions from Mueller.\nCohen also reiterated that Trump lied repeatedly to the American public during the 2016 campaign by saying he had no dealings with Russia. In fact, Cohen has told prosecutors, Trump was keenly pursuing a lucrative tower in Moscow until June 2016.\nTrump\u2019s former fixer cautioned that he could not prove the \u201ccollusion\u201d with Moscow that the president vehemently denies. Still there was, Cohen said, \u201csomething odd\u201d about the affectionate back-and-forth Trump had with Vladimir Putin in public remarks over the years.\n\u201cThere are just so many dots that seem to lead in the same direction,\u201d he said.\nMichael Cohen was a lawyer for Donald Trump from 2006 until 2018. He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump\u2019s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.\nIn August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nCohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump\u2019s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.\nHaving previously described himself as \u201cthe guy who would take a bullet for the president\u201d, when sentenced, Cohen said \u201cI have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.\u201d\nThe 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans. He is expected to report to jail in May 2019.\nMartin Belam\n\nThe extent to which Mueller\u2019s findings will be made public is unclear. Justice department policy is that a sitting president may not be charged with crimes. But Democrats have vowed to get their hands on the full report \u2013 and launch impeachment proceedings if necessary.\nSecond, Cohen continues to implicate Trump in a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws \u2013 and on Wednesday dragged Donald Jr in as well.\nCohen released copies of cheques signed by both Trumps that, he said, were reimbursements for payments he made to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actor who alleged she had an affair with Trump.\nFederal prosecutors in New York allege the payments amounted to an illegal scheme, using undisclosed funds to protect Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Cohen, who is due to go to prison in May for three years, pleaded guilty to involvement in the scheme \u2013 and alleged that Trump directed him to commit the campaign finance crime.\nThat could leave the elder Trump vulnerable to prosecution on charges in his native New York when he leaves office, according to legal analysts. And Cohen\u2019s testimony on Wednesday indicated that Donald Jr could face similar jeopardy more immediately.\nCharging documents in Cohen\u2019s case said two senior people in the Trump Organization \u2013 identified only as \u201cexecutive 1\u201d and \u201cexecutive 2\u201d for the time being \u2013 were also involved in executing the illegal scheme.\nExecutive 1 is understood to be Allen Weisselberg, the Trumps\u2019 longtime chief financial officer, who has been granted immunity to help prosecutors in their investigation. Executive 2 authorised Weisselberg to make a payment to Daniels, the prosecutors said.\nDonald Jr had posted 30 tweets or retweets about Cohen\u2019s testimony by lunchtime on Wednesday. Many of them championed the Republican congressmen who were loyally striving to criticize Cohen and save their leader.\nNone, though, addressed the allegation about his own involvement. But one of the reimbursement cheques produced by Cohen offered a clue. It bore the signatures of two executives: Weisselberg and Donald John Trump Jr.\nFurther dangers may await the Trumps down the road. Cohen said on Wednesday that he was unable to discuss his final contact with Trump last year, because that was being investigated by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\nHis questioner, the Democratic congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, tried again. Was Cohen aware of any further illegal activity or wrongdoing by Trump that had not yet been discussed?\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cAnd again, those are part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being looked at by the southern district of New York.\u201d",

        "content": "Rose Torphy is three years older than the national park itself, and recently joined as its oldest-ever junior ranger\nRose Torphy has had a large life.\nAt 103, she\u2019s the matriarch of a family with five generations now below her. She loves bowling, traveling and watching poker. Every afternoon, she takes her daily glass of wine into her bedroom to toast a photo of her late husband of more than six decades, Ralph: \u201cHere\u2019s to you: no one better, no one damn near as good.\u201d\nAnd Torphy has just become the oldest-ever junior park ranger at the Grand Canyon national park \u2013 which is three years younger than she is, and is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its designation this week.\n\u201cIt was a special occasion,\u201d Torphy said of her swearing-in ceremony. \u201cI enjoyed every minute of it.\u201d\nTorphy visited the park with her husband in 1985 and fell in love with it. \u201cWe thought it was the most marvelous thing,\u201d Torphy said in a recent interview at her home in Fox Lake, Illinois, an exurb about an hour north of Chicago. \u201cWe always talked about it to the kids. I always told them it was something they have to go to see.\u201d\nBut, she said, she never went back until last month. She and her daughter, Cheri Stoneburner, took a trip to visit Stoneburner\u2019s daughter, who works at the canyon. There, Torphy recreated a photograph she\u2019d taken with her husband more than 30 years ago, sitting in a chair President Theodore Roosevelt had sat in, and went all the way up to the edge of the great expanse \u2013 something she didn\u2019t get to do during her and Ralph\u2019s quick senior bus trip in the 80s. At the conclusion of the January visit, she was sworn in as a junior park ranger. Her job duties? To spread the word about the park\u2019s beauty and virtues.\n\u201cEverywhere she goes, she wears [her park ranger badge] on her coat,\u201d Stoneburner said. \u201cShe tells everybody all about it.\u201d\nTorphy\u2019s love of nature began as a child. Born in Superior, Wisconsin, in 1915, she went with her family to a different lake every weekend, when \u2013 she\u2019s quick to note \u2013 a night in a cabin cost just a dollar. Her appetite for adventure continued after she met Ralph, with whom she traveled extensively until his death in 1999. \u201cWe planned vacations around going to see the world,\u201d Torphy said. \u201cWe had a wonderful life.\u201d\nIn all her travels, which included Belgium, where her parents emigrated from more than 100 years ago, the Grand Canyon stood out, and she was always sure to tell her kids, grandkids, great grandkids, and great-great grandkids about it. She\u2019s seen a lot change over the years \u2013 a woman who remembers the advent of radio has lived long enough to become a viral sensation online \u2013 but was pleased to see the Grand Canyon was mostly as she\u2019d remembered it.\n\u201cThe area had grown up a little,\u201d Torphy said. \u201cBut the canyon still looked the same, and it was wonderful.\u201d\nNow, Torphy is getting to promote the park to a wider audience, not least during an appearance on Good Morning America that she remains incredulous about.\nFor the Grand Canyon Conservancy, the not-for-profit organization that funds the junior ranger program and conducted Torphy\u2019s swearing-in, that means a charming new spokeswoman for the park, which was established on 26 February 1919 by President Woodrow Wilson and today attracts more than 6 million visitors a year.\n\u201cPeople like Rose help us educate the public to ensure this natural wonder is here for the next 100 years,\u201d Susan Schroeder, the group\u2019s CEO, said in an email.\nFor Torphy, it\u2019s just one more achievement in an extraordinary run.\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d she said in the home she\u2019s shared with her daughter since November, surrounded by photographs of her family, turning over in her hands a locket containing a photograph of Ralph. \u201cI feel blessed.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 27 February 2019 to clarify when Rose Torphy\u2019s parents emigrated from Belgium.",

Once the stooge had bought the painting, he was paid $60,000 with money from the Trump Foundation, a charitable organization.\nCohen told the House oversight committee that Trump told him to find a straw bidder to purchase the portrait by William Quigley, with the objective being to \u201censure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon\u201d.\nCohen told Congress: \u201cMr Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself.\u201d\nTrump also tweeted about the sale saying he had \u201cjust found out about it\u201d.\nJust found out that at a charity auction of celebrity portraits in E. Hampton, my portrait by artist William Quigley topped  list at $60K\nThe painting was being auctioned at the ArtHamptons gala, one of the three major art events that takes place in the Hamptons each July.\nThis is not the first time the story about this painting has surfaced. In 2015, Dan\u2019s Papers, a local newspaper in the Hamptons, interviewed Quigley about the sale and he revealed then that Trump had paid for the painting in person.\n\u201cHe was nothing but a gentlemen,\u201d Quigley said at the time. However, Cohen\u2019s testimony corroborates speculation that Trump had used Trump Foundation funds to pay for it.\nBizarrely though, it\u2019s also not the first time that Trump has used his foundation\u2019s funds to pay for a portrait of himself at an auction. Last year, the New York attorney\u2019s general office, which was investigating corruption at Trump\u2019s foundation, revealed in litigation that Trump had bid $10,000 for a painting of himself at a charity auction at Mar-a-Lago.\nThat portrait was by the Israeli artist Havi Schanz. Trump\u2019s lawyer claimed he was only hoping to start the bidding with a high price, but as no one else bid he ended up paying for it.",

Although he subsequently went to two Sheffield Wednesday matches in early April, he acknowledged that he had only a \u201cvery general\u201d knowledge of the ground\u2019s layout. He was unaware that the approach to the Leppings Lane turnstiles was a bottleneck, he said, and acknowledged it was a failure not to appreciate the potential for congestion at the turnstiles.\nDuckenfield accepted it would have been \u201csensible\u201d to have strategies to avoid congestion \u2013 the jury has heard that 23 turnstiles were allocated for all 24,000 people with tickets to support Liverpool, and seven of those turnstiles, A to G, were for all 10,100 people with standing tickets.\nDuckenfield told the inquests that he had not given \u201cany thought one way or another\u201d to the need to \u201cfilter\u201d people on the approach to the turnstiles, to reduce the risk of congestion.\nHe did not know, he acknowledged, that the turnstiles A to G opened on to an inner concourse which had a large tunnel facing people, leading to the Leppings Lane terrace \u201cpens\u201d.\nLambert asked him at the inquests about the risks potentially posed to people\u2019s safety by the division of the Leppings Lane terrace into pens: \u201cMr Duckenfield, did you recognise the risk of overcrowding that was created by the existence of the pens on the Leppings Lane terrace?\u201d\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am,\u201d he responded.\nThe jury has been told that at 2.52pm Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate, C, to be opened to alleviate the congestion at the turnstiles, that approximately 2,000 people were allowed in through it, and that many went down the tunnel facing them, into the central pens, where the lethal crush took place.\nAsked about his appointment, given his inexperience, Duckenfield told the inquest that he had been told he could rely on an experienced and efficient team of officers. As match commander, he understood that his decision-making would only be required for \u201cextraordinary and non-routine matters\u201d and if something went wrong. Asked at the inquest by Lambert if he had concerns that there was limited time to become \u201cau fait with what the job of match commander involved,\u201d Duckenfield replied: \u201cI\u2019m older, hopefully wiser [now]: probably I wasn\u2019t the best man for the job on the day.\u201d\nEarlier on Wednesday, the manslaughter trial was told the names and ages of all 96 people who were killed in the crush on the terrace\u2019s central pens, and the principal medical cause of death, which was compression asphyxia in all but one. The names were mostly read in order of age, from the youngest, Jon-Paul Gilhooley, 10, then the 37 who were teenagers, to the oldest person to die, Gerard Baron, 67.\nAfter the reading of names, the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, gave a direction to the jury: \u201cObviously we all recognise that the deaths of 96 spectators, many of whom were children and young people, is a profound, human tragedy and any subsequent trial is inevitably dramatic and indeed, from time to time, distressing. But when I come to sum up the case to you, I will tell you to put aside your sympathies and emotions.\u201d\nDuckenfield, 74, denies gross negligence manslaughter in relation to 95 of the people who were killed. Graham Mackrell, 69, the former Sheffield Wednesday secretary and safety officer, has pleaded not guilty to two breaches of safety legislation. Openshaw directed the jury that neither the film footage nor the deaths of the 96 people, nor the events of the day itself, were relevant to the case against Mackrell.\nThe trial continues.",

At 8,126 metres, it is the ninth-highest mountain in the world.\nTensions between Pakistan and India over the disputed region of Kashmir have made the search for the pair difficult, as Pakistani airspace was closed after India launched airstrikes on Tuesday in retaliation for a 14 February attack on an army convoy that it blames on Islamabad.\nPakistani rescue teams have been involved in the search and had recruited the help of Muhammad Ali Sadpara, who climbed the mountain two years ago, Nardi\u2019s team reported. A helicopter search of the mountain was rescheduled on Wednesday night for daylight, they said.\nBallard\u2019s mother, Alison Hargreaves, died on K2 in 1995, when he was six years old, three months after she became the first woman to climb Everest unsupported and without oxygen.\nBallard, 30, from Derbyshire, is an experienced climber and has said: \u201cSince I was 10, all I\u2019ve wanted to do was to climb. Even before I was born I climbed the Eiger. So it\u2019s no surprise what I do now.\u201d\nHe has climbed the six north faces of the Alps solo in winter. Nardi, 42, has unsuccessfully attempted to climb Nanga Parbat in winter on several occasions.\nThe duo were most recently in contact with their support team on Sunday, when their fellow climber Diotallevi Bruno said they had reached at least 6,300 metres. He posted: \u201cThe weather is not good, there was fog, sleet and wind gusts.\u201d\nNanga Parbat earned its nickname after it claimed the lives of at least 30 mountaineers in the 1930s, including seven German climbers and nine Sherpas in 1937.\nThe British mountaineer Albert Mummery led the first expedition to try to reach the summit in 1895, but died in the attempt. Hermann Buhl, from Austria, was the first to reach the summit in 1953.\nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cOur staff are in contact with the Pakistani authorities regarding a British man who has been reported missing.\u201d",

        "content": "Traders still have doubts about the PM getting her deal away despite chance of extra time\nThe pound jumped to a fresh 10-month high on Wednesday after it became obvious that Britain will avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal. Obvious, that is, to City traders, who have always bet that a deal is the most likely outcome of the Brexit talks and now believe it to be a racing certainty.\nTheresa May\u2019s concession of a vote in a fortnight to delay Brexit, which she agreed as a way to keep her own deal in play, was the trigger for a Mexican wave across the City.\nSterling burst through $1.33 against the dollar for the first time since last July, a date seared on the memories of those obsessed with Brexit as the month when Theresa May outlined her Chequers plan, prompting Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson to resign.\nMuch has happened since then, though it hasn\u2019t added up to much. One instance can be found in the government\u2019s planning to cope with a no-deal Brexit, for which it has set aside \u00a34bn. As the Department for Exiting the European Union admitted earlier this week, only two thirds of \u201ccritical projects\u201d \u2013 such as safeguarding medicine imports \u2013 are anywhere near completion with just four weeks to go.\nSome might say this failure to prepare is part of the plan. May is still convinced she can cobble together a revised backstop that satisfies all but the most ardent Brexiters and channels most MPs into the aye lobby when her deal comes back to the house for one last time. To stand a chance, she needs the threat of a no-deal #brexitshambles to herd MPs in her direction.\nThe City is less sure about the potential for May\u2019s plan to succeed, which is why there are good odds in bank dealing rooms for a delay leading to a better deal or second referendum. Not that a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all is necessary to cheer the City. Bankers, like most large businesses, would reluctantly support Theresa May\u2019s deal.\nMaybe City traders are right to believe the latest manoeuvrings in parliament rule out a no-deal outcome.\nBut their view might just be overly sanguine after months of fruitful lobbying to make sure any Brexit blockages affecting the sector have been given the proverbial enema, allowing financial transactions to continue unhindered to the US and EU, deal or no deal.\nThe City was one of the \u201ccritical concerns\u201d that regulators and politicians put at the front of the queue. Let\u2019s hope it means banks won\u2019t be too shocked should a deal prove elusive and most businesses are forced to jump out of the EU plane without a parachute.\nGo online or suffer a slow death. That\u2019s the maxim most retailers live by. Black Friday and Cyber Monday last November pushed the proportion of retail spending online to 21.5%, up from 7.9% in the same month in 2009.\nIt is in that context that Marks & Spencer has asked shareholders to back a \u00a3750m 50:50 joint venture with what some people regard as the UK\u2019s premier online food retailer, Ocado.\nAs a number of analysts have pointed out, the price is high. And in the light of M&S\u2019s \u00a31.8bn net debt, \u00a3600m will need to be raised from shareholders directly in the form of a rights issue and a hefty cut of 40% in the dividend payout is also required. Understandably, shares in the company fell more than 12%.\nBut the M&S board may believe it had little option.\nIt might have continued to ignore online food sales, but as more shoppers switch online that is not a strategy for growth. Especially with the ever-looming threat of Amazon marching into the UK grocery business. M&S has been considering and experimenting with online food sales for years, but it is now paying the price for being late to the party \u2013 very late: Tesco.com started in 2000.\nM&S could also have developed its own IT system and warehousing. But that would also have been expensive and could have been far riskier, potentially leaving investors with years of misery as managers reported one glitch after another.\nM&S has form here \u2013 its most recent foray into automated warehousing and stockpicking was so disastrous that insiders referred to it as their \u201cbleeding edge\u201d technology.\nOcado, on the other hand, saw its shares edge up 3%. It never had a brilliant working relationship with Waitrose and its M&S deal will be more lucrative and provide the cash it needs to continue investing in new distribution hubs for other customers.",

        "content": "Were May and Corbyn chosen for their entertainment value? It\u2019s the only explanation that makes sense\nThink of Westminster as a replicant variant of The Truman Show. A reality show in which the entire cast of grotesques and inadequates believe they are genuinely in power, while the audience of millions enjoys the comedy, the self-inflicted crises and the series-ending cliffhangers. In schools and universities around the world, the programme is hailed as an object lesson in how not to run a country.\nIt\u2019s just about the only explanation that now makes sense. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s one that saves a lot of heartache and existential despair. Consider the evidence. How else could you end up with two party leaders less suited to office, if not for the fact they had been deliberately chosen for their entertainment value? After all, competence makes for spectacularly dull TV.\nThere was a time a few years ago when prime minister\u2019s questions were almost a box-office draw. Hard to believe, but David Cameron and Ed Miliband were a lukewarm ticket. That good. Now, with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as the main attractions, it has become everybody\u2019s short straw.\nMinisters and shadow ministers know they are likely to appear in every camera angle. So they shoot up amphetamines behind the Speaker\u2019s chair before taking their seats. Eyes bulge in blank stares, beads of sweat appear and teeth grind as they fight to stay awake throughout the 45-minute session. Backbench MPs have an easier time of it. Barbiturates are openly tossed around like Smarties as everyone seeks their own private oblivion.\nThen the lack of fun began. Corbyn opened promisingly enough with an attack on May for screwing up the country with a double whammy of austerity and her handling of Brexit. The prime minister mumbled something almost unintelligible \u2013 English is her second language, bollocks being her first \u2013 at being proud of the expansion in the use of food banks. And that was pretty much that. Five more times the leader of the opposition asked an almost identical question and five times he got the same non-answer.\nWeirdly, both leaders appeared quite satisfied with their efforts. But there again, a no-score draw probably suited both. Corbyn wasn\u2019t called upon to explain why he considered Chris Williamson\u2019s unapologetic stance on the party\u2019s antisemitism to be so serious that it could only be dealt with by the most extreme punishment of a rap over the knuckles. Though later in the day, the Labour leader would come to realise that the charges weren\u2019t as grave as first thought, and consequently reduced the punishment to a suspension. Only Labour can turn a major embarrassment into a total humiliation.\nAnd May looked chipper because she didn\u2019t have to relive her latest U-turn adventures through the wormhole into an 11th dimension where \u201ca delay is a delay\u201d didn\u2019t mean a delay. That hospital pass was handed over to David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, who had to open the debate on why the government had nothing new to say about its Brexit negotiations.\nBrexit is taking the same toll on Lidington as it is on everyone else. Where once he was one of the sharper minds in the cabinet \u2013 low bar, admittedly \u2013 he can now only talk in near-meaningless sentences riddled with contradictions. What makes this all the more painful to watch is that he is conscious enough to be aware he is talking nonsense.\nHe began by reiterating the government\u2019s position that it didn\u2019t really have a position other than to try to get the same deal that had already been rejected passed at the second attempt. After that, we were in the badlands of no deal or an extension of indeterminate length. He had no idea which and certainly wasn\u2019t going to give any indication on how the government might vote on either of those options because he knew the prime minister well enough to know that whatever she had decided now would be contradicted later.\nLidington made sure to take plenty of interventions, hoping people would forget he didn\u2019t have anything to say and delaying the greater disaster that was yet to come. Eventually he could delay the inevitable no longer. On to the amendments. Mutter, mutter, mutter. He wasn\u2019t accepting the Cooper-Letwin amendment but he wasn\u2019t opposing it either. So he was accepting it then? Yeah, but no, but yeah, but no, but yeah. Mutter, mutter, mutter. He was also accepting the Spelman amendment. Sort of.\nThen the coup de grace. The government was going to accept the Costa amendment on citizens\u2019 rights. Brilliant. Alberto Costa had been forced to resign as a parliamentary private secretary earlier in the day for tabling an amendment against the government that the prime minister had previously said she wouldn\u2019t accept, only to find his amendment was now government policy and he was out of a job. Meanwhile, three cabinet ministers had written an opinion piece in the Daily Mail rubbishing the government\u2019s Brexit policy and hadn\u2019t been asked to quit.\nJust another day in The Truman Show. The evening highlights package might even prove to be a ratings winner. After all, everyone loves a car crash.",

        "content": "The Derby North MP defended Labour members expelled or under investigation during antisemitism rows \nChris Williamson is a politician whose career has taken him from Blairite council leader who once briefly formed a coalition with the Tories, to Labour\u2019s most controversial MP \u2013 too outspoken even to serve under Jeremy Corbyn.\nIn between, during his first spell as MP for Derby North, he was briefly a low-profile Ed Miliband loyalist. But those who have known him for years say Williamson changed dramatically after he unexpectedly lost his seat by 41 votes in 2015.\nIn this parliament he has rapidly become Labour\u2019s most divisive MP, particularly after he resigned as fire spokesman in January 2018 after making the relatively mild suggestion that council tax bills for the highest value homes should be doubled.\nIn quitting that post, Williamson pledged he would campaign on \u201ca broad range of issues\u201d while supporting Corbyn. But as one Labour MP observed: \u201cHe might have started as an outrider, but I think he\u2019s gone further than the leadership thought he would.\u201d\nWhen Labour became embroiled in a toxic series of rows over antisemitism during 2018, Williamson repeatedly shared platforms and spoke in defence of members expelled or under investigation over accusations of anti-Jewish hatred.\nWilliamson tweeted in defence of Ken Livingstone after he was forced to resign for repeatedly saying Zionists had collaborated with Hitler, describing the former London mayor as a \u201ctowering figure\u201d who fought \u201call forms of racism\u201d.\nThe controversial MP has campaigned for the reinstatement of Marc Wadsworth, who was expelled for abusing Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth at a public event, saying that decision \u201coffends natural justice\u201d.\nIn the summer, Williamson continued to support Pete Willsman in his attempt to get elected onto Labour\u2019s national executive committee, even though he was dropped from Momentum\u2019s slate after he had been recorded saying that Jewish \u201cTrump fanatics\u201d were making false claims of antisemitism in the party. Willsman was elected anyway.\nThe Derby North MP is a relatively isolated figure in the Parliamentary Labour party (PLP), and when he speaks \u2013 often in raised tones \u2013 it is not uncommon for him to be heckled by colleagues at internal meetings, when others are listened to politely.\nAt this week\u2019s PLP meeting in Westminster, Williamson called for party unity during discussions about a second referendum and antisemitism. His voice was so loud that it could easily be heard in the corridor outside; one high-profile MP walked out saying: \u201cI can\u2019t listen to him any more.\u201d\nMany Labour MPs have complained at the way Williamson travelled around the country encouraging members to deselect them on his \u201cdemocracy\u201d roadshow, a series of events in over 20 towns and cities ranging from Redcar to Portsmouth \u2013 and Streatham, where Labour defector Chuka Umunna is the sitting MP.\nThe now-suspended Labour MP said that the roadshow events were nothing for colleagues in his party to worry about. He told the Morning Star: \u201cEnabling members to decide who their candidates should be before each general election is commonplace in other democracies around the world.\u201d\nFirst publicised in a video, which features him gingerly riding a Harley Davidson to the sound of Born to be Wild, the voiceover from the 62-year-old adds: \u201cSadly empowering some of our members is portrayed by some people as a scary thing.\u201d\nSo pleased was Williamson when it emerged that Labour MPs were defecting to create the Independent Group last week, that he sang Celebration by Kool & the Gang repeatedly. As he told his audience in Sheffield: \u201cI was singing that all day in my office full blast, and my office, by the way, is right opposite Joan Ryan\u2019s [another defector]\u201d.\nSome in Labour even believed that Williamson\u2019s trips around the country, and his unambiguous positioning on the left, were an attempt to position himself for a future run at the party\u2019s leadership.\nSignificantly, during the incident that prompted Williamson\u2019s suspension \u2013 his claim at a meeting of Sheffield Momentum that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism \u2013 he appears to have been loudly applauded by those present.\nIronically, others in the Derby party membership are considering whether to try to deselect him \u2013 by taking advantage of processes Williamson himself has encouraged party activists to use. \u201cThe question is whether we make a move, or wait to see if he blows himself up,\u201d said one local activist.\nFour years ago, Williamson\u2019s political career seemed all but over after his unexpected defeat in 2015 left him jobless for the first time in his adult life. He had been a bricklayer and an adult social worker before turning to politics.\nHe was a councillor in Derby during the last decade, leading the council twice, and was remembered in local politics for embracing the private finance initiative to help deliver council services, as well as the Tory deal.\nWilliamson won the Labour nomination in the marginal seat of Derby North before the 2010 election, seeing off a union-backed candidate who had the support of the left. He was a keen backer of Ed Miliband and served as shadow fire minister between 2010 and 2013, although was frustrated when he lost his job in a reshuffle.\nAfter losing his Derby North seat to the Conservatives, Williamson backed Corbyn in the 2015 leadership election. However, an attempt to become Derbyshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner failed when he came third in an internal selection battle involving three candidates.\nTheresa May\u2019s snap election in 2017 brought him back to Westminster, however: 2015 candidates who wanted to stand again were able to do so if they were approved by a three-strong NEC panel.\nThat simplified an otherwise uncertain reselection process, and Williamson was re-elected to Westminster by 2,015 votes \u2013 one of 36 gains made by Labour that night.\nHowever, Derby North remains a highly marginal seat, a point that was underscored when Labour lost control of Derby city council last May.",

Boyce said they \u201call wanted extras, and the extras were dealt with in different ways, without affecting the level playing field for everyone else\u201d.\n \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Leighton said.\nThe jury was also read transcripts of Leighton\u2019s interviews with both the FCA and SFO, which were part of investigations into the Qatar deal. Leighton was quoted as saying the \u201cadvisory services agreement was entirely separate to the best of my knowledge at the time\u201d, according to statements read by Boyce.\nThe defence lawyer also highlighted that executives were celebrating the deal. Boyce said the ASA was \u201csomething that caused the bank to blow its trumpet, and broadcast as loudly as it could \u2026 we want the whole world to know about it because it\u2019s so good for us, so good for the bank.\u201d\n \u201cYes that\u2019s right,\u201d Leighton said.",

If that fails to pass, MPs will be given a vote on leaving with no deal and, if that also fails, on extending article 50 beyond the 29 March departure deadline.\nHere are the amendments selected by the Speaker:\nThe Labour frontbench put down an amendment that would give parliament a say on a Brexit deal the party could support, including a full customs union, stronger single market alignment and more robust protection for the environment and workers\u2019 rights.\nThe amendment was voted down by 323 to 240 votes.\nThe five demands on the amendment mirrored those sent by Jeremy Corbyn in a letter to Theresa May, spelling out changes the prime minister would need to seek in order to gain Labour support.\nLabour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the Conservatives\u2019 Sir Oliver Letwin had rattled Downing Street with an amendment that would pave the way for a bill to extend article 50, over which ministers had threatened to resign to support it. Letwin and the amendment\u2019s other Tory backer, Nick Boles, have now said they are happy with the prime minister\u2019s pledge to hold the votes on 13 and 14 March. However, to hold the prime minister to her promise, Cooper tabled an amendment to reiterate May\u2019s statement, in effect forcing the government to vote for her amendment. The amendment was voted through by 502 to 20 votes, a majority of 482.\nThe amendment of the Conservative backbencher Alberto Costa has drawn the most cross-party support. It calls on the government to implement the part of the withdrawal agreement that includes citizens\u2019 rights at \u201cthe earliest opportunity\u201d regardless of the outcome of negotiations. The government has accepted this amendment after Costa resigned and it was passed without a general division \u2013 or \u201con the nod\u201d.\nSupporters of the amendment included Corbyn, the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who is a high-profile supporter of a second referendum, and the Brexiter and the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.\nCosta resigned as a PPS in the Scotland office in order to table the amendment.\nThe SNP and Plaid Cymru tabled an amendment suggesting the UK should not leave without a deal at any time, even if article 50 is extended.

        "content": "The newly knighted choreographer is shutting his company due to cuts and has snapped his achilles tendon. But he\u2019s full of optimism about the future\nI\u2019m expecting Richard Alston to be angry, dejected, or at least a little perturbed. The 70-year-old choreographer recently announced he would be closing his company next year, not out of choice, but because of Arts Council England funding cuts. The company had just celebrated its 25th anniversary, and 50 years of Alston being a choreographer, the quality of work as fine as ever. Alastair Macaulay, former chief dance critic of the New York Times, called it \u201cunequivocally the grimmest news for British dance this century\u201d. It seemed utterly sad, at this stage in Alston\u2019s life and career, for him to have the rug pulled from under his feet.\n  But Alston is not angry. In fact, there was an element of hara-kiri: Alston was part of the decision. His company\u2019s funding is tied to that of the Place, the dance organisation where he is based, and the ACE stipulated that the money allocated to Alston from the pot should be more than halved, effectively killing the company. \u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t agree to do this, there was a threat that the Place would not get its funding,\u201d he says. \u201cThe issue is that, technically speaking, the Arts Council has no method to fund an older artist.\u201d\nWe meet in an office next to Alston\u2019s dance studio, surrounded by years of VHS tapes of performances waiting to be digitised. He is tall, generously bearded and elegant, although a little less so thanks to the medical boot he\u2019s wearing, having snapped his achilles tendon. It\u2019ll take six weeks to heal, he explains, \u201cso I will definitely be wearing this to Buckingham Palace.\u201d\nAh yes, Buckingham Palace. Around the same time that his funding was cut, Alston was awarded a knighthood \u2013 talk about mixed messages. \u201cThat really warmed my heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly supportive.\u201d He and Matthew Bourne are the only contemporary choreographers to have been knighted. \u201cI got this letter in my rather scruffy hallway. When I opened it I just screamed.\u201d\nAlston is sanguine about his company\u2019s fate. \u201cMy energy is directed to making sure we don\u2019t dwindle away. That we have another season as exciting as anything [before]. We started the spring tour in Bath and the audience went wild. Quite elderly people going wild, which was exciting. I think it\u2019s partly because they\u2019re beginning to understand that we won\u2019t be here for ever.\u201d\nAlston is also regularly stopped at the theatre for selfies by teenagers who are studying his work. He is an enormously important part of British dance, one of the country\u2019s first homegrown contemporary choreographers. His instinctive musicality (whether using Scarlatti, Brahms or Terry Riley) makes his work easy to watch, but it is also full of rigour, detail and nuance, a sense of line and classical proportion and a lilting, curving grace.\n  He spent his early years in Paris, where his father worked for the British Council. \u201cWe used to go to the Cirque Medrano. I wasn\u2019t interested in the acrobatics per se, but I loved seeing these people moving.\u201d He went to Eton, where the school\u2019s record collection provided his musical education and he excelled in ballroom dancing classes.\nAlston dropped out at 16, around the same time his brother bought him tickets to see the Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Festival Hall in London. \u201cI found it pretty bizarre but I was fascinated.\u201d Mikhail Fokine\u2019s Chopiniana pas de deux \u201cmade my heart beat faster\u201d and he was hooked. At Croydon \u2019\u2019School of Art, he would miss evening lectures to take the train to Covent Garden for cheap seats at the Royal Ballet. \u201cWe all knew each other,\u201d he says. \u201cI see people now, distinguished elderly gentlemen, \u2018Oh, remember when we were in the gods together!\u2019\u201d The dance obsession became all-consuming. \u201cI decided, this is what I want to do, put my pencil down and put on some tights and get moving.\u201d\nThis gangly young man took some classes with Ballet Rambert, and soon after, New York\u2019s Martha Graham Company came to London and Alston saw a note in the programme saying dancer Robert Cohan would be staying behind after the tour to teach. Alston went along, and the members of the class became the first performers in London Contemporary Dance Theatre. Six months later, when they needed new choreography, Alston made some. \u201cI am absolutely the arch example of being in the right place at the right time,\u201d he says. The company\u2019s co-founder, Robin Howard, took a shine to him. \u201cWe came from the same sort of background. We both got out of public school and wanted to do something very different.\u201d\n  Alston went on to co-found Strider, Britain\u2019s first independent dance company, and spent two \u201cabsolutely wonderful\u201d years in New York in the late 70s studying with Merce Cunningham. For six years, he was artistic director at Ballet Rambert (promptly changing its name to Rambert Dance Company). He was politely sacked from Rambert in 1992, when he was 44. \u201cSo there was a very clear sense that there was going to be something new. Whereas at 70, a lot of people think I\u2019ve chosen to retire and that\u2019s that. I haven\u2019t!\u201d He wants to continue making work. \u201cMy only nervousness is that I have put myself about so little,\u201d he says, referring to the necessary freelance hustle. \u201cI have never written to companies saying I\u2019m the most marvellous choreographer. I\u2019ve been allowed to get on with being in the back room. But if I stay there I could just disappear.\u201d\nFor now, there are this season\u2019s performances, and new work to make for the final tour. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure there is something joyful,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was always the difficult one in the middle. There\u2019d be something jolly by two choreographers and then there\u2019d be me in the middle. And then, when I made pieces like Roughcut [set to Steve Reich\u2019s Electric and New York Counterpoint] and the audiences all cheered, I thought, I rather enjoyed that! It\u2019s not so undermining of your integrity, is it?\u201d He learned a lot from the early work of choreographer Twyla Tharp, who made complicated dance to pop music. \u201cYou can be lighthearted about things and be very serious,\u201d he says. \u201cLike Fred Astaire.\u201d\n  Sometimes, young choreographers ask Alston what he does when he gets stuck. His honest answer is that he doesn\u2019t, because he always has the music. \u201cI say to them, don\u2019t sit on the floor and bite your nails. Make something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not really into deep concepts and things,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a tremendous love of skill. My involvement with youth dance shows me that young people love it too \u2026 jumping, turning. It\u2019s only when they go on a degree course that they think, oh, I can\u2019t do that any more, I\u2019m supposed to do something more thoughtful.\u201d\nDo Alston\u2019s interests, in fluent dancing, skill, speed, craft and music make him unfashionable? \u201cYes, probably,\u201d he says. \u201cI have no worries about that. I think the things I believe passionately in are timeless.\u201d\nIn a cruel stroke of ageing for a man whose life\u2019s work is so intimately tied to music, Alston is losing his hearing. \u201cThe upper register is very bad,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s profound.\u201d That must be very difficult, I say. \u201cYes, but thank God I\u2019ve listened to so much music. Sometimes I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m hearing music or remembering music.\u201d He\u2019s fine working with small groups in the studio, less so in bigger spaces. \u201cWhen I go to theatres and parties I just practise my most warm, warm smile.\u201d And it means he doesn\u2019t go to concerts any more. Instead, he goes to galleries and reads copiously. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to see the furniture in my flat because there are books all over the place.\u201d He lives near Hampstead Heath, north London \u2013 alone because \u201cI\u2019m an absolute workaholic \u2013 I\u2019m like a sort of monk. All those years ago at art college there was a rather impatient fellow student who once said to me, Richard, you\u2019re like a helium-filled balloon tied to the Earth by a tiny string called dance.\u201d\nAlston has no intention of cutting that string, hoping that there are companies \u2013 and no doubt there will be \u2013 \u201cwho\u2019d be interested in taking a risk in letting an elderly deaf man loose on their dancers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m confident of my own resilience,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever it is I\u2019m going to find to do, I will find a way of enjoying it.\u201d He knows it\u2019s been a privilege to pursue his passions for so long. \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky, and a very happy man,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever happens they can\u2019t take that away.\u201d\nRichard Alston Dance Company: Quartermark is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 1-2 March.

Plus: anger and regret as cardinal goes to jail \nGood morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 28 February \u2013 the last day of summer.\nDonald Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen has cast the president as a \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cconman\u201d who engaged in criminal activity after taking office as president to cover up an illegal payment to an adult film actor. In explosive public testimony before Congress, Cohen said Trump had prior knowledge of the WikiLeaks release of hacked Democratic emails, and was aware of the Trump Tower meeting between members of his presidential campaign and a Russian lawyer. \u201cToday, I am here to tell the truth about Mr Trump,\u201d Cohen said in his opening statement. \u201cI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\u201d Cohen\u2019s testimony spells trouble for Trump on two fronts, writes Jon Swaine: Russia and campaign finance violations.\n\u201cLove him or loathe him, he has always been a son of Ballarat, and people were proud of his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the world,\u201d says Andrew Collins, the public face of clergy abuse in Ballarat. The church remains an imposing force in the town where Cardinal George Pell grew up and many residents at midday mass on Wednesday, as Pell\u2019s sentencing was taking place, proclaimed his innocence. But the town holds a history of shocking abuse. \u201cAs children our tiny bodies were used, abused and cast away,\u201d Collins says. \u201cOur minds were screwed up and nobody believed us. Now we are broken adults and those who speak up are called friends of the devil by the pope.\u201d As Pell awaits a jail sentence for sexual assault, David Marr observed the cardinal\u2019s last moments before being taken into custody.\nThe Morrison government will persist with its attempted climate policy pivot by promising $50m in grants for businesses and community organisations to embark on energy efficiency projects, and an additional $17m to help building owners benchmark their energy use. As part of the government\u2019s efforts to woo back voters in its small \u201cl\u201d liberal heartland deeply concerned about the Coalition\u2019s record on climate change, Morrison has this week kicked in $56m for the Marinus link, and has flagged further taxpayer underwriting of the \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d renewable energy project. The $50m will go towards 2,500 grants to eligible businesses and community organisations to help them save energy.\nDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have begun their second summit, with the US president calling his North Korean counterpart \u201ca great leader\u201d and offering to help give his country a \u201ctremendous future\u201d.\nPakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has appealed for talks with India, making reference to both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals, after a series of tit-for-tat airstrikes that have edged the pair closer to war than at any point in the last 20 years.\nAlmost 5,000 complaints of sexual abuse and harassment of migrant children in US custody have been filed over the past four years, with allegations ranging from adult staff members abusing minors to forcible touching, government documents show.\nThe UK Labour party has suspended an MP, Chris Williamson, after he was filmed saying the party had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. Jeremy Corbyn came under intense pressure to take tougher action, after initially allowing Williamson to remain a Labour member while a series of complaints against him were considered.\nThe Glastonbury festival has banned plastic bottles in an attempt to stem the waste left in its wake. In 2017 visitors to the festival got through 1.3m plastic bottles.\nDuring previous bouts of militarised aggression between India and Pakistan, US presidents used personal diplomacy to convince both sides to pull back from the brink. But with Trump showing scant interest, who will pull them back from the edge this time? The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, examines the contenders.\nThe economy hasn\u2019t been looking too hot for a while and now the construction industry is showing worrying signs. It has been one of the key sectors for job growth and it looks to be slowing quite drastically, which does not bode well for the unemployment rate. Greg Jericho explains what it means.\nAfter the negativity surrounding the Matildas over the last month, the Cup of Nations, the four-team World Cup warm-up tournament which starts today in Sydney, provides a reset for fans and players alike. The star striker Sam Kerr has been handed the captain\u2019s armband, while Steph Catley will be her vice.\nLast weekend\u2019s bust-up between the Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and coach Maurizio Sarri was a boon for the marketers who increasingly see Premier League football as a dramatic TV show rather than \u201cmerely\u201d a sport, writes Marina Hyde. \u201cExecutives at leading clubs speak unabashedly of \u2018content\u2019, which might be actual football, but might equally be some made\u2011for\u2011Instagram stunt. The biggest club brands consider themselves to be in the entertainment industry.\u201d\nAt some point between his 13th and 14th birthdays, the boy\u2019s enthusiasm for the choir at Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s cathedral waned considerably. \u201cLittle murmurs, you know? Like, he was tired, you know, of the commitment to getting up early in the morning to practise,\u201d his mother says. In an extract from Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell, one boy\u2019s family tells Louise Milligan the cataclysmic effect abuse had on him and his friend. It tells the story of the two teenage boys who were sent on scholarships from what were then Melbourne\u2019s inner suburbs to a Catholic boys\u2019 school \u2013 St Kevin\u2019s College \u2013 and the priest who would change their lives forever.\nThe year after he left the choir, the boy got into drugs in a big way. By the age of 30 he was dead of a heroin overdose. \u201cWhile at age 13 he had sung Handel\u2019s Messiah, clad in a choirboy\u2019s crimson and white robes, eyes cast up to heaven, by his 14th year he was already dabbling in heroin. \u2018It\u2019s devastating to watch your child spiral like that,\u2019 Mary says, shaking her head at the memory of anger, frustration, heartbreak that she dealt with in equal parts.\u201d\nAlmost all the papers again feature George Pell strongly on their front pages, with the Australian reporting that he spent his first night in prison in a solitary cell. The ABC reports that Australia\u2019s first so-called jihadi bride has emerged from Islamic State\u2019s last stronghold, and says the children of Australia\u2019s most infamous terrorist, Khaled Sharrouf, are alive. And the NT News says a business summit has delivered a blunt message to the Northern Territory government that the business community needs help to reinvigorate or risks losing faith in Michael Gunner\u2019s leadership entirely.\nIt is believed that Ita Buttrose will be named the new chair of the ABC today.\nThe ARL will meet to decide behavioural policy after a string of scandals involving rugby league players during the off season.\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.",

        "content": "Top official reverses initial decision not to suspend Chris Williamson after pressure from within party\nLabour\u2019s deep divisions over antisemitism were exposed afresh on Wednesday, after the party\u2019s top official, Jennie Formby, succumbed to intense pressure and suspended the MP Chris Williamson.\nThe announcement reversed a decision hours earlier to allow Williamson to continue to remain a Labour MP, while a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d was investigated \u2013 which had sparked a furious backlash from senior MPs, including the deputy leader, Tom Watson.\nIn the week when Jewish MP Luciana Berger defected to the breakaway Independent Group, saying she had become \u201cembarrassed and ashamed to remain in the Labour party\u201d, Williamson was filmed saying Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d, about antisemitism.\nIn the footage, first revealed by the Yorkshire Post, Williamson was cheered by activists in Sheffield as he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d\nThe Derby North MP, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, issued an apology on Wednesday morning, saying: \u201cI deeply regret, and apologise for, my recent choice of words when speaking about how the Labour party has responded to the ongoing fight against antisemitism inside of our party. I was trying to stress how much the party has done to tackle antisemitism.\u201d\nShortly afterwards, a spokesman for Corbyn announced Williamson had been issued with a \u201cnotice of investigation\u201d; but he would remain a Labour member while a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d was examined.\nSeveral backbenchers told the Guardian they were convinced Corbyn himself had been involved in the decision not to suspend Williamson immediately. But a Labour spokesman insisted: \u201cJeremy did not intervene.\u201d\nWilliamson was also facing complaints about having booked a room in parliament to screen a controversial film about Jackie Walker, an activist suspended from the party.\nThe Derby North MP is an enthusiastic supporter of Corbyn, who served as shadow fire minister, before being removed from the post after departing from the Labour line on taxation.\nThe Labour leader told Williamson\u2019s local paper, the Derby Telegraph, in January: \u201cChris Williamson is a very good, very effective Labour MP. He\u2019s a very strong anti-racist campaigner. He is not antisemitic in any way.\u201d\nThe decision not to suspend Williamson immediately sparked a fierce backlash among MPs, with Watson calling his apology \u201clong-winded and heavily caveated\u201d, and saying he would already have been suspended \u201cif it was in my gift\u201d.\nChris Williamson has produced a long-winded and heavily caveated apology. It is not good enough. If it was in my gift I would have removed the whip from him already. pic.twitter.com/IuEpDM1Ak2\nThe GMB trade union leader, Tim Roache, as well as the anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate, called for the whip to be withdrawn immediately.\nAfter his suspension was announced several hours later, Labour MP Wes Streeting said: \u201cThis is very welcome, however overdue. The leadership needs to send a message to every member that dismissing or delegitimising concerns about antisemitism will not be tolerated. Zero tolerance must mean zero tolerance.\u201d\nWatson challenged Corbyn directly over the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism cases on Sunday, stepping up a war of words between the pair since nine Labour MPs left the party last week.\nWatson said Corbyn faced \u201ca crisis for the soul of the Labour party\u201d \u2013 and presented him with a dossier of 50 antisemitism cases he claimed had been reported by MPs in recent months and not yet dealt with.\nFormby, a former Unite organiser, was backed for the post by Corbyn, and promised to speed up action against antisemitism.\nShe and Corbyn came under pressure throughout Wednesday to suspend Williamson immediately, while a series of complaints against him were considered.\nLabour\u2019s backbench parliamentary committee, which consists of senior MPs selected by their colleagues, decided to lodge its own protest, by asking Williamson not to attend the weekly meetings of the party\u2019s MPs.\nAnd 38 MPs from the soft left Tribune group, including several frontbenchers, signed a letter to Formby calling for his immediate suspension. More MPs made their views known to Corbyn\u2019s office throughout the afternoon.\nThe Guardian understands that there was also considerable disquiet among Labour staff about the decision not to suspend Williamson while his case was considered. \u201cAfter a coordinated push we got them into the right place,\u201d said one senior party source.\nWe must set the highest standards for ourselves on issues of racism, sexism and bullying if we are to be seen as a party that can lead on behalf of all sections of our communities. pic.twitter.com/zGMINqSqE3\nWilliamson said on Wednesday evening he planned to clear his name, insisting: \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a very strong case. There is no evidence against me in reality.\u201d\nTheresa May seized on the case at prime minister\u2019s questions, saying: \u201cIf Jeremy Corbyn wanted to take action against racism in his party he\u2019d suspend Williamson immediately.\u201d\nThe tensions over antisemitism have added to the sense of disquiet at senior levels in Labour since the creation of the Independent Group last week.\nCorbyn and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, announced a shift towards supporting a second referendum on Monday, in part to reduce the risk of further defections.\nBut anti-referendum MPs reacted angrily \u2013 and some shadow ministers were irked at being excluded from the decision, which was rubber-stamped at a small Brexit strategy group.\nCorbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, rang shadow cabinet members on Wednesday to apologise for not consulting them about the change of policy, the Guardian understands.\nEven some of Corbyn\u2019s inner circle were concerned about the Labour leader\u2019s defiant response to last week\u2019s resignations, in which he called for immediate byelections in their seats \u2013 and reminded them they were elected in 2017 on his manifesto.\nIn response to Watson\u2019s demand that he carry out a shadow cabinet reshuffle to \u201cbroaden out\u201d the frontbench, Corbyn said: \u201cAnyone who does not feel consulted is not taking up, in my view, the opportunities that are available, at all times, to do that.\u201d",

The 72ft diameter pipe, known as Morning Glory Spillway, or simply Glory Hole, takes in water like a drain, once the reservoir is filled over capacity, and shoots it into a creek below the Monticello Dam.\nNorthern California has seen heavy precipitation for weeks. Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes due to risks of floods near the town of Guerneville, and highways around the region have been shut down because of the downpours.\nGlory Hole wasn\u2019t designed to spill over on a regular basis, though it has twice in the past two years, and previously in 2006 and 1996. The US Bureau of Reclamation built the hole in 1957 to take in water for storm events that it expected would occur every 50 years or so.\nWhile the lake is a popular boating area, it\u2019s not likely anyone would accidentally slip into Glory Hole. The bell-mouth spillway can swallow up lake water at a rate of 48,000 cubic ft per second, but there\u2019s not much suction to pull boats toward it. A buoy line also floats around it and Bureau of Reclamation rangers check it regularly. It\u2019s also illegal for recreators to approach Glory Hole, since laws prohibit boaters from traveling near dams, such as the one next to spillway.\nHowever in previous overspills one swimmer was in fact sucked into Glory Hole, disappearing into its watery depths in 1997. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Emily Schwalen, 41, of Davis, California, held onto the side of the spillway for 20 minutes before being swept inside. Her body was found three hours later.\nSign up for This Land is Your Land, our monthly email on public lands\n This article was amended on 2 March 2019.

        "content": "If Fulham\u2019s Premier League obituary had not already been written, then this will likely be remembered as the night they lost their fight for survival, as Southampton coasted to a rare routine victory. Even the eternal optimist, Claudio Ranieri, who headed straight down the tunnel at the final whistle after watching his lifeless team succumb to an eighth defeat in nine matches, is battling to put on a brave face. Fulham, who are 10 points from safety, need a miracle, and fast, if they are to avoid an instant return to the Championship.\nAs for Fulham\u2019s disenchanted supporters, who sorely miss the swagger with which they won promotion, they are resigned to their fate and have already raised the white flag. To make matters worse, they face Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in three of their next four matches. After their recent run the damage those sides could inflict does not bear thinking about.\nFulham proved their own worst enemy here, typified by another erratic display by Sergio Rico in the Fulham goal; his poor clearance teed up Oriol Romeu to rifle home before he allowed James Ward-Prowse to add a second; Fulham have shipped a league-high 63 goals.\nRanieri, who trumpeted his belief that his players can still steer clear of the drop, shrugged his shoulders at the notion his job may not be safe. \u201cI am used to believing,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething could happen. If you don\u2019t believe, it\u2019s done. You have to believe, you have to fight. If you don\u2019t fight, you\u2019ve already lost. Always in my career, I am used to working hard. It is very difficult but until it is mathematically impossible, we continue to fight.\u201d\nThe Italian\u2019s substitutions midway through the second half gave the travelling supporters the chance to vent their frustrations. They unfurled a banner with the words \u201cRisk free? Are you watching Tony Khan?\u201d \u2013 a dig at comments made by Khan\u2019s father, Shahid, the Fulham owner, after his appointment in November. The belated arrival of Ryan Sessegnon, their standout performer last season, prompted chants of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d. Given how Fulham\u2019s aggressive recruitment drive has spectacularly backfired \u2013 typified by Rico\u2019s form \u2013 the old adage that, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it, springs to mind. Fulham offered little, though Ryan Babel, a surprise January signing, came closest to giving the visitors an unlikely lifeline, rattling the bar late on.\nRalph Hasenh\u00fcttl, the Southampton manager, described this game as a \u201cshould-win\u201d as opposed to a \u201cmust-win\u201d encounter and there was never any doubt that his side would prosper and record a victory that hoists them out of the relegation zone. A warm glow has surrounded Hasenh\u00fcttl since his arrival in December but there was no hiding from the fact that they needed a fillip, with the same old issues that beset his predecessors \u2013 bluntness in attack and an evident brittleness at the back \u2013 continuing to blight Saints of late.\nRico played Fulham into trouble early on, making a total mess of things when H\u00e5vard Nordtveit spooned an aimless ball into the box by Yan Valery high into the air. After the ball returned to earth Rico failed to claim it, instead clambering around Charlie Austin, who eventually hooked the ball into an unguarded net, only for the referee, Anthony Taylor, to blow for an extremely soft foul by the Southampton striker. Fulham were off the hook but, when Rico flapped at a Bertrand corner, this time the damage was lasting. Rico rose above Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa to clear the ball but his powder-puff punch landed at the feet of Romeu on the edge of the box, with the midfielder smacking home beyond a sea of Fulham bodies.\nSouthampton doubled their lead four minutes before the interval after more kamikaze Fulham defending. Rico\u2019s hopeful pass out from the back kick-started a horrible chain of events for Fulham, as some head tennis in midfield ensued before Austin fed Nathan Redmond to take aim. But it was Rico\u2019s error when parrying Redmond\u2019s curled shot that proved fatal, with the goalkeeper spilling his effort, allowing Ward-Prowse to bury the rebound. Southampton, who face Manchester United and Tottenham next, are unlikely to have it this easy again for a while. \u201cIt was a big step for us \u2013 only one \u2013 but a very important one,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cWe were very clinical, professional.\u201d",

        "content": "At times like this all seems swell in Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s world. Under the gleam of the lights, finding space and time on a football pitch, his talent unfurled again. Arsenal\u2019s enigmatic playmaker, who has looked like Unai Emery\u2019s type all too infrequently during this problematic season, illuminated this match with an exhibition of golden touches.\nYes, there is the caveat that Bournemouth are on a painful losing run away from home. It\u2019s pretty unlikely he will be trusted with the intensity of Tottenham away on Saturday but even Emery must have gone home scratching his head at how the player who has been his biggest battle this season could also look like such a blessing.\n\u00d6zil scored, assisted, and generally shone. As did another of Arsenal\u2019s erratic creators, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, whose passing and finishing was also on song. All in all Arsenal seized the opportunity to express themselves against a team who shared their trait for looking like they could concede a chance at any time \u2013 only more so. With a testing week coming up with matches against Tottenham, Rennes and Manchester United, this booster came at a convenient time. Emery spoke afterwards about his desire to show \u201ca complete match\u201d at the Emirates for a while, and this one delivered that.\nEmery was reluctant to wax lyrically about the scintillating performances of \u00d6zil and Mkhitaryan. He responded to the question as to whether they made themselves hard to drop with the play-safe generalisations he prefers. \u201cI am going to watch this match for the analysis. And I am going to watch Tottenham. Then I will decide our plan against them. We need big commitment from every player to help us.\u201d\nThere wasn\u2019t much of a deadlock for Arsenal to unpick and they were ahead in the fourth minute when \u00d6zil was found in such ample space that even a man of his fondness for assists could not turn down the invitation to shoot. He dinked the ball with his heel and a hint of backspin and it floated sweetly. \u00d6zil was engulfed in a group hug.\nThe attacking combinations created a second goal which was beautiful in its simplicity. Mkhitaryan captured the ball and slid the ball to \u00d6zil, whose return pass was guided to land so Mkhitaryan did not have to break stride to score. \u00d6zil\u2019s name rang freely around the Emirates.\nBut Bournemouth rallied and found a route back into the game, showing determination to claw back a goal. Dan Gosling\u2019s pressing as the home team tried to play out from the back reaped its reward. The midfielder snaffled the ball off Matteo Guendouzi, who was badly punished for dallying, and centred for Lys Mousset to tap home.\nAfter that encouragement, Eddie Howe\u2019s frustration was laid bare as he watched his team shudder at the beginning of the second half just as they had the first. Arsenal\u2019s cushion was restored early in the second half as Mkhitaryan drove in a cross and Laurent Koscielny\u2019s deflected shot bounced off the post too awkwardly for Artur Boruc.\nBack came Bournemouth through the energetic Fraser, and the Scot was kept out with a solid save from Bernd Leno, before Gosling whacked a dipping shot against the crossbar. But Arsenal eased further in front when Mkhitaryan\u2019s pass encouraged Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to switch on the afterburners. The striker jinked past the onrushing Boruc and steered in unerringly. Substitute Alex Lacazette iced the cake with a superb free-kick.\nBournemouth are stuck in a rut away from home and Howe\u2019s disappointment was obvious. \u201cWe have to be very clear that we can play a lot better than that. We must not kid ourselves that today was acceptable. Obviously we made mistakes that contributed to our own downfall. A lot of things hurt us. We need to perform better. We need to make that change ourselves. We need to give everything.\u201d\nTheir next away game, at Huddersfield, is as good an opportunity as any to turn the tide.\nFor Emery the next stop is the north-London derby and the incentive to try to get to within a point of Tottenham. \u201cIt is,\u201d he mused, \u201ca huge motivation.\u201d",

        "content": "To revive an old and unfulfilled prophecy of G\u00e9rard Houllier\u2019s, Liverpool truly are 10 games from greatness. They have faltered recently and lost their attacking verve along the route but, far from feeling the pressure of the title race, they revelled in it against Watford on Wednesday night. The Premier League leaders were insatiable, unstoppable and clinical as they recorded the biggest victory of what J\u00fcrgen Klopp hopes will be the breakthrough season for his club.\nThe Liverpool manager gave an Oscar-winner\u2019s speech, eulogising all those who had made the victory possible and acknowledging he may have forgotten somebody. It was a lengthy list. Mohamed Salah was \u201cunplayable\u201d according to Klopp. Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold \u201cbrilliant\u201d as he returned to the side with vengeance plus a hat-trick of inch-perfect assists. Fabinho appeared to run central midfield single-handedly, although that does a disservice to those around him. Sadio Man\u00e9 scored twice, the second an audacious and glorious finish, as did Virgil van Dijk with two towering late headers. Divock Origi chipped in with a fine goal as he replaced Roberto Firmino.\nStrength in depth, a clean sheet and a rampant team brushing aside a side in \u201cbest of the rest\u201d territory before kick-off. It was a result and performance that blew away creeping suspicions about Liverpool losing their edge and composure just as the season enters its critical phase. It was a result and performance that told Manchester City they will be difficult to dislodge. And it was needed. Three draws in the previous four league games demanded a reaction, despite Klopp\u2019s claim it is growing expectation that afflicts Liverpool, and another heavy defeat of Watford \u2013 who have lost here 5-0, 5-0 and 6-1 on their past three visits \u2013 was timed as perfectly as it was executed.\nKlopp sowed doubt in Watford from the start by stationing Origi on the left and handing Man\u00e9 opportunity to wreak havoc through the centre. It was an invitation he devoured. Other changes from Manchester United on Sunday, James Milner returning to midfield and Alexander-Arnold recalled at right-back, were also key in extending Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten league run here to a commanding 35 games.\nManchester City (86 points)\n24 Apr Man Utd (a)28 Apr\u00a0Burnley (a)4 May\u00a0Leicester (h)12 May\u00a0Brighton (a)\nLiverpool (85 points)\n21 Apr\u00a0Cardiff (a)\u00a026 Apr\u00a0Huddersfield (h)5 May\u00a0Newcastle (a)\u00a012 May\u00a0Wolves (h)\nMilner signalled the kind of night that lay in store for the visitors when he charged down an early clearance from Ben Foster. The Watford goalkeeper escaped on that occasion, the ball looping into the air and his embrace, but was convincingly beaten when a carefully constructed attack released Man\u00e9 for the first time.\nHe was involved at the start of the move with a lay-off to Milner on the edge of the area. By the time the ball arrived in the box via an immaculate first time cross from Alexander-Arnold, the Senegal international had peeled into space between Watford\u2019s central defenders. Foster was left waving at thin air as Man\u00e9\u2019s powerful header flew into the top corner.\nQuality deliveries from Alexander-Arnold were a feature of Liverpool\u2019s first-half dominance as the defender showed his manager what was lacking at Old Trafford. Salah\u2019s tormenting of Adam Masina and Craig Cathcart was another. Both played their part in a second goal of impudent class from Man\u00e9.\nA strong run from Salah was halted inside the area but Liverpool remained in possession through Georginio Wijnaldum. He teed up Alexander-Arnold for another precision cross into Man\u00e9 whose first touch shifted the ball away from goal. No bother. He simply back-heeled his second touch up and over the advancing Foster and into an empty net. The gasp that preceded the roar around the ground said everything about the finish.\nFear stalked the Watford defence each time Salah received the ball in space, a lesson they failed to heed from United\u2019s approach at Old Trafford. The paucity of the visitors\u2019 attacking display was summed up by Javi Gracia withdrawing both of his forwards, Troy Deeney and the erratic Gerard Deulofeu, in a double substitution.\nInevitably, it was Liverpool who struck again when Origi capped a promising return to the starting line-up with a fine finish. Andy Robertson found the striker lurking unmarked on the left wing with Watford defending deep and in numbers. Undeterred, the Belgium international darted into the area and away from two defenders before cutting a low and emphatic shot back inside Foster\u2019s near post.\nVan Dijk made it four when he powered home a close range header from Alexander-Arnold\u2019s free-kick. He celebrated his second goal at Anfield with a fist-pumping celebration in front of the Kop and followed that up with a glancing header past Foster from Robertson\u2019s cross three minutes later.",

        "content": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r had sounded the call to arms. Manchester United were in the midst of an injury crisis and it was incumbent on a big player to step up from the fringes to save them. The caretaker manager named names, too. He wanted to see Romelu Lukaku and Alexis S\u00e1nchez play to their potential.\nIt was Lukaku who delivered. The striker blew a glorious chance in the eighth minute but he did not go into his shell, far from it. He put United in control with two excellent finishes, one with either foot \u2013 the first from the edge of the penalty area \u2013 and, although Crystal Palace fought back to score through Joel Ward, it was Lukaku who helped to ensure that his team had the final word.\nLukaku combined with Paul Pogba before the latter played in Ashley Young and the United captain angled home a powerful drive. Palace had fought from the first whistle but, at last, they were deflated. Down on the touchline Solskj\u00e6r pumped his fists in a familiar show of contentedness.\nAnd so it goes on. Solskj\u00e6r remains unbeaten in the Premier League since he stepped in to replace Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in mid-December \u2013 he has won nine and drawn two of 11 matches \u2013 and it now feels as though it is a question of when rather than if he is confirmed by the club as the next permanent manager.\nUnited want a leader to instil a fast and exciting style, to reacquaint the fans with a sense of enjoyment. They want somebody who understands the club\u2019s traditions. And they would not mind if results came along, as well. Quite simply Solskj\u00e6r has come to tick every box.\nPalace have never beaten United in the Premier League and they have now tried and failed on 20 occasions. This was a 16th defeat. They rattled United at times in the first half and, when Ward dived to head home, the grandstand finale was on.\nThe home crowd bellowed their encouragement and there were flickers from their team. The substitute Max Meyer forced David de Gea into a save and Andros Townsend saw a shot charged down. But United held firm \u2013 their work rate and organisation were praised by Roy Hodgson \u2013 and after Young\u2019s goal, there was even time for Solskj\u00e6r to introduce the 17-year-old central midfielder James Garner for his debut.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got great faith in James as the next Michael Carrick,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not fair on kids to compare them to great players like Michael was but he\u2019s in the same mould. I know it\u2019s pressure but you\u2019re at Man United. Michael had the pressure of coming in after Roy Keane, so that\u2019s just the way it is at Man United.\u201d\nSolskj\u00e6r radiated confidence even though he was without eight senior players because of injury. Marcus Rashford, who had been a doubt with an ankle problem, was fit enough to make a 77th-minute appearance off the bench. Solskj\u00e6r could include only Pogba from his first-choice front six and he improvised by starting the full-back Diogo Dalot on the right wing, which worked well. Dalot had previously played there for Porto.\nAll eyes were on Lukaku and S\u00e1nchez, not to mention the midfielder Fred, who made his first appearance since early January. S\u00e1nchez was a disappointment, unable to create anything and going to ground a little too easily, while Fred\u2019s evening was a mixed bag.\nIn the absence of Rashford, Solskj\u00e6r started Lukaku through the middle and he responded with his first goals in 10 appearances, although he had to taste a low before the highs. In the early running he found himself all alone and centrally placed, eight yards out, from the excellent Luke Shaw\u2019s corner \u2013 only to sky the volley.\nLukaku\u2019s opening goal came from a much more difficult opportunity, following a burst from Shaw. The Belgian took a touch to set himself before curling a low right-foot shot into the far corner.\nTownsend had blown a clearcut 11th-minute chance from James McArthur\u2019s cross and had fizzed a low drive past the post. Immediately after Lukaku\u2019s breakthrough Jeffrey Schlupp stretched to meet a Townsend cross but could not direct his header on target.\nHodgson described Lukaku\u2019s second as a \u201ccold shower\u201d for his team and it came after Pogba had headed off-target when well placed. United won two headers inside the area following Young\u2019s corner, firstly through Chris Smalling and then Victor Lindel\u00f6f, and Lukaku hooked the bouncing ball into the far corner.\nWard\u2019s goal from Schlupp\u2019s cross was his first of the season. But United had too much.",

        "content": "Maurizio Sarri, in time, may point to this as the victory which breathed life into his tenure as Chelsea\u2019s head coach \u2013 the moment when all the doubts that had infected his team over the winter months gave way to newfound belief in the Italian\u2019s methods. That, at least, must be the long-term hope. For now he can bask in a timely win over bitter rivals which has earned him significant respite after a desperate few weeks.\nTottenham, their display as troublingly disjointed as in defeat at Burnley a few days previously and with Saturday\u2019s derby against Arsenal looming ever larger, ended embarrassed here with Kieran Trippier inexplicably placing a back pass wide of an on-rushing Hugo Lloris six minutes from time. The ball trickled unaided over the line with Willian in hot pursuit and those in the Matthew Harding stand already bouncing gleefully in celebration. The crowing din of the home support will have pursued the visitors from the arena.\nThe French World Cup winner had endured a hideous evening, allowing Pedro\u2019s opener to squirm through his legs and nestle inside the near post via a flick from his right ankle, with his rather frazzled display epitomising that of the team. It was as if Chelsea tapped into that insecurity, sensing vulnerability and exploiting it ruthlessly, all while the world\u2019s most expensive goalkeeper twiddled his thumbs among the home side\u2019s substitutes.\nWhat had initially been dismissed in public as an innocent \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d back at Wembley on Sunday, when Kepa Arrizabalaga had refused to be substituted by a head coach on the brink, had actually left the Spaniard \u00a3190,000 out of pocket and dropped. Yet that show of strength from Sarri, a decision made \u201cfor the good of the group\u201d as a reminder that the priority must always be the collective, ended up feeling cathartic. Kepa\u2019s name had drawn some boos when read out over the Tannoy before kick-off but Chelsea were a team united, galvanised by a collision with local rivals and rallying behind Willy Caballero on his first Premier League start since last May. They ended with the relationship between squad and crowd \u2013 so strained at times of late \u2013 audibly reinforced.\nThe restoration of spirit was epitomised by David Luiz, Antonio R\u00fcdiger and the excellent Pedro sprinting to Caballero at the final whistle to celebrate. Or C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, an on-field captain whose failure to usher Arrizabalaga from the pitch had drawn criticism on Sunday, muscling his way into every spat or confrontation between teammates and Spurs players which drew the referee\u2019s whistle. The home side ended up prevailing despite Eden Hazard being visibly exhausted and withdrawn before the hour-mark, but with others stepping up to ensure Chelsea remain only three points adrift of the top four.\nManchester City (86 points)\n24 Apr Man Utd (a)28 Apr\u00a0Burnley (a)4 May\u00a0Leicester (h)12 May\u00a0Brighton (a)\nLiverpool (85 points)\n21 Apr\u00a0Cardiff (a)\u00a026 Apr\u00a0Huddersfield (h)5 May\u00a0Newcastle (a)\u00a012 May\u00a0Wolves (h)\n\u201cThe result was very important because the fans saw the team able to fight,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cFor the relationship with the fans it was really a very important match. But I am the coach. I think about my team and what is important now is consistency. To fight for 10 matches in a row. Maybe we are not able to win 10 matches in a row but we\u2019ll be able to fight.\u201d They make the short journey to Fulham on Sunday with faith apparently restored and their head coach, whose position had felt terminally undermined even before Kepa\u2019s show of petulance publicly belittled his authority, suddenly spying light at the end of the tunnel.\nTottenham, in contrast, might have entered the gloom. They barely tested Caballero, a mere spectator until he punched away Trippier\u2019s free-kick just before the half-hour mark and, even if Harry Winks battered a shot on to the crossbar from distance, did not muster a shot on target for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s stewardship in a Premier League game, though Chelsea themselves managed only one. They were marginally off kilter all night, forever slightly off the pace with Christian Eriksen\u2019s promptings suffocated and Harry Kane frustrated and infuriated.\nThe England captain had squared up to David Luiz and Azpilicueta in the first half \u2013 there was a hint of a headbutt at one point \u2013 and there were further flashpoints near the end, by which time Spurs\u2019 cause felt hopeless.\nGonzalo Higua\u00edn had struck an upright long before Pedro, fed by Azpilicueta\u2019s pass beyond Ben Davies, had edged the hosts ahead, turning inside Toby Alderweireld before spitting a shot through Lloris\u2019s legs at the near post. Chelsea suggested they would probably see out the win with that lead still slender before Trippier\u2019s wayward pass and Lloris\u2019s rush of blood further punctured the visitors late on.\nSpurs\u2019 lead from fourth-placed Arsenal has been trimmed to four points before Saturday\u2019s meeting at Wembley. \u201cBut at the beginning of the season everyone would have been satisfied to be going into this game with that gap,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cThe pressure is on them, not only us. Them too, surely.\u201d\nThe Argentinian has spent the last few months looking up towards Liverpool and Manchester City, rather than fretting over who is hovering at Tottenham\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhy should we be careful [about a top-four finish]? I am not afraid. I have freedom in my mind, the same feeling I had before. It\u2019s not a drama, eh? It\u2019s about being calm. We need to support the players, lift them and help them to compete on Saturday.\u201d",

        "content": "Boy and girl, now four, are only the second case of \u2018sesquizygotic\u2019 twins recorded\nA pair of twins have stunned researchers after it emerged that they are neither identical nor fraternal \u2013 but something in between.\nThe team say the boy and girl, now four years old, are the second case of semi-identical twins ever recorded, and the first to be spotted while the mother was pregnant.\nThe situation was a surprise to the researchers. An ultrasound of the 28-year old mother at six weeks suggested the twins were identical \u2013 with signs including a shared placenta. But it soon became clear all was not as it seemed.\n\u201cWhat happened was the mother came back for her routine ultrasound some months later, and we saw one [twin] to be a boy and one to be a girl,\u201d said Dr Michael Gabbett, first author of the report from Queensland University of Technology in Australia. \u201cAt that point we started the genetic studies and worked it out from there.\u201d\nTwins are normally either identical or fraternal. In the case of identical, one egg is fertilised by one sperm, but the resulting ball of cells splits in two, giving rise to two offspring with identical genetic material. In the case of fraternal, or non-identical, twins, two eggs are fertilised, each by a different sperm. The resulting siblings arise from the same pregnancy, but are no more genetically similar than siblings from the same parents born at a different time.\nFaced with a puzzling scenario, Gabbett and colleagues report in the New England Journal of Medicine that they took samples from the two amniotic sacs, allowing them to investigate the genomes of the twins during the pregnancy.\nThe results, they say, reveal a very unusual situation: the twins are semi-identical or \u201csesquizygotic\u201d.\n\u201cWhat we have got is a sequence of unusual events,\u201d said Gabbett.\nThe situation is believed to arise when two sperm cells fertilise a single egg. In the latest case, one sperm carried an X chromosome among its genetic material, and the other carried a Y chromosome.\nAfter fertilisation the chromosomes from the two sperm cells and the single egg got bundled into three \u201cgenetic packages\u201d: one contained chromosomes from both sperm \u2013 meaning it contained two sets of genetic material from the father, but none from the mother. The other two packages each contained the same set of chromosomes from the mother, as well as genetic material from one of the two sperm, giving rise to either XX (female) or XY (male) cells.\nAs the fertilised egg divided and the ball of cells grew, those containing only chromosomes from the two sperm died. However, those containing chromosomes from both the egg and a sperm cell continued to divide.\n\u201cThen what happens is that little ball of cells splits into two, and that is why you have twins,\u201d said Gabbett, adding that these offspring have a greater genetic similarity than fraternal twins, but are not identical.\nBut the situation is not that straightforward: some of both embryos\u2019 cells contained two X chromosomes, while other cells contained an X and a Y chromosome.\nGabbett added since one twin was a boy and the other a girl, the ratio of each of these types of cell differed: one embryo contained a greater number of XY cells, so developed male, while the other had a high proportion of XX cells and developed female.\nThe only previously reported case of sesquizygotic twins came from the US in 2007, discovered after one of the children was born with ambiguous genitalia. The team say the children in the latest report had no such ambiguities.\nHowever, the case was not without complications. While the children were delivered by caesarean section and appeared healthy, it was found the baby girl had developed a blood clot shortly before birth. Her arm was amputated when she was four weeks old.\nThen at the age of three, the girl had her ovaries removed as it was found they had not fully formed, which can increase the risk of a certain type of cancer \u2013 a situation that was down to her genetic makeup.\nGabbett said that while there might be other, unreported, cases of sesquizygotic twins, it remains a very unusual phenomenon. Among their investigations, the team looked back at genetic data for nearly 1,000 pairs of what were thought to be fraternal twins, but found no other cases.\n\u201cIt is incredibly rare so we don\u2019t think it is something people should be routinely tested for or worried about,\u201d said Gabbett. But, he added, it challenges conventional thinking. \u201cWe traditionally categorise twins as either identical or non-identical, and this is a third type of twinning characterisation,\u201d he said.",

The centre remains torn between staying at Leicester or opting for a fresh start in France and described it as \u201cthe toughest decision\u201d of his career.\nShould Tuilagi agree lucrative terms to join Racing he would be ineligible to represent England beyond this autumn\u2019s World Cup, having only recently reclaimed his international starting place after a string of injuries. \u201cIt will be the toughest decision I\u2019ve had to make,\u201d he said, speaking in Oxford, where England are in camp. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive decision and I have to make the right one for me and my family. There is a lot on the line for everyone.\u201d\nReports last week suggested Tuilagi , 27, was bound for Paris but even in defeat last Saturday\u2019s Test against Wales in Cardiff was a reminder of how much he relishes playing for England.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to consider. I\u2019m back with England and I loved playing at Cardiff, even though we lost. I love playing at the Tigers too. I need to take some time after this campaign, put everything on the table and make the right decision.\u201d\nSo far Eddie Jones, the England coach, has made no concerted attempt to influence Tuilagi\u2019s decision, other than to make jokes about the player eating baguettes and croissants.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not really spoken about it \u2026 there\u2019s nothing to be spoken about because I haven\u2019t made a decision,\u201d said Tuilagi, insisting reports he had already signed were premature.\n\u201cWhen I saw that [piece saying he had signed] I didn\u2019t know what to say really. I haven\u2019t made a decision yet, so everyone [in the squad] is cool about it.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s retirement of Mathew Tait, his Leicester clubmate who also suffered a catalogue of injuries, however, has reinforced just how precarious top-level rugby careers can be.\n\u201cYou see a lot of players retiring through injury and yesterday it was a good mate of mine, Mathew Tait. I never would have thought he\u2019d be gone that early [aged 33]. Now all of a sudden he\u2019s retired. I have to take all that stuff into consideration and do the right thing.\u201d\nOne potential compromise might be to go to France for two seasons and then, in a perfect world, return for one last tilt at a World Cup before the next tournament in France in 2023.\nChris Ashton and James Haskell have already proved it is possible for England players to have their g\u00e2teau and eat it, and Racing\u2019s offer exceeds anything Leicester can afford.\nAs things stand Tuilagi seems genuinely in two minds. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought too far ahead. At the moment I\u2019m still committed to Tigers and England and all my focus is here and on trying to finish [the Six Nations] on a high.\u201d\nEngland will on Thursday crank up their preparations for the game against Italy at Twickenham on 9 March with a full-on training session against Georgia, whose coach, Milton Haig, says his players will be up for the challenge.\n\u201cThis is a big occasion for our guys,\u201d Haig said. \u201cWe will all suit up and there will be some contact, not stupid stuff, but it will be refereed properly and we can challenge for the ball.\u201d\nLast year Georgia caused England\u2019s forwards significant scrummaging problems in a session in London and Haig reckons that will not have been forgotten.\n\u201cThere is a bit of edge this year and you can understand why. When two sides have a mindset that they don\u2019t want to give an inch or millimetre, you usually get a bit of tension.\u201d\nEngland are hopeful the lock Maro Itoje (knee) and wing Jonny May (concussion) will be fit enough to be considered against Italy. Jones\u2019s side can still win the title should Wales slip up over the final two games and the defence coach, John Mitchell, believes the Cardiff result may yet prove a blessing in disguise.\n\u201cWales have done us a huge favour in many ways, because they have made us acutely aware of what we must fix,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe need to do that as quickly as possible. There\u2019s not a lot you really need to tweak because we have a particular way we believe in but, clearly, our strategy will improve because of the Cardiff game.\u201d",

        "content": "As a measure of what an unexpectedly difficult night this was for Manchester City, it was the first game all season they have failed to score two goals or more in the league at their own ground. No other side has managed that kind of record over a 15-game period in the top division since Tottenham in 1965 and, in the case of Pep Guardiola\u2019s team, their previous assignment here was a 6-0 rampage against Chelsea.\nAt this stage of the season, however, they will not mind too much that their latest victory was a more prosaic affair featuring a penalty decision that must have hurt their opponents. On the balance of play, there could be no doubt City were the superior team, particularly when Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling added some much-needed impetus during the second half. All the same their former manager, Manuel Pellegrini, could conceivably have seen his current team emerge with a battling draw but for the contentious moment just before the hour mark when Silva went down under Felipe Anderson\u2019s largely innocuous challenge and Sergio Ag\u00fcero was handed the chance to continue his scoring run.\nThat was Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 25th goal of the season and, more importantly, it ensured City kept up the pressure on Liverpool at the top of the table. Yet it was a struggle at times for the reigning champions, epitomised by Guardiola replacing his leading scorer towards the end with a midfielder, Phil Foden, and the unusual sight of Kevin De Bruyne trying to waste a few seconds in stoppage time by running the ball towards the corner flag.\nManchester City (86 points)\n24 Apr Man Utd (a)28 Apr\u00a0Burnley (a)4 May\u00a0Leicester (h)12 May\u00a0Brighton (a)\nLiverpool (85 points)\n21 Apr\u00a0Cardiff (a)\u00a026 Apr\u00a0Huddersfield (h)5 May\u00a0Newcastle (a)\u00a012 May\u00a0Wolves (h)\nAs Pellegrini said afterwards of the penalty: \u201cTo be generous, it was a little soft. But that would be too generous. In the other box [the West Ham substitute] Manuel Lanzini had the same play but did not throw himself to the floor. If we lost this game from another action, we could accept it but it was not a penalty.\u201d\nA single-goal victory, settled by a moment of controversy, was certainly not what many City fans might have anticipated when, to put it into context, Guardiola had won all six of his previous encounters against these opponents, with an aggregate score of 22-3. On that basis West Ham ought to be reasonably encouraged, particularly as Marko Arnautovic was absent with a virus and Ben Johnson was making his first Premier League start. As the cousin of Ledley King and nephew of Paul Parker, Johnson, a 19-year-old full-back, comes from a family that clearly places great importance on the art of defence, and that was probably just as well given the amount of time West Ham had to spend in retreat.\nNot that City had it all their own way. Guardiola\u2019s body language was telling at times, staring out anxiously from the dugout or moving to the edge of the pitch, arms folded or hands shoved into his pockets. He claimed afterwards he was \u201cdelighted\u201d that his team had played \u201cso good.\u201d During the game, however, he looked dissatisfied and at times the crowd sounded it, too, particularly when Riyad Mahrez was straying offside or misplacing passes. This was Mahrez\u2019s first start in a league match since 30 December and, though Sterling and Silva were entitled to a rest, it was not a good night for the club\u2019s record signing, looking conspicuously low on confidence and substituted early in the second half.\nThe same could be said for Samir Nasri, who was barely involved for West Ham on the night he returned to face his former club. Pellegrini replaced him with Lanzini at the break and, five minutes after the restart, the substitute set up Andy Carroll for West Ham\u2019s first chance of the night. It was a splendid chance, too \u2013 by far the clearest opportunity until that stage. Carroll was at full stretch when he connected with Lanzini\u2019s cross but Ederson\u2019s flying save spared City from going behind.\nFor West Ham it was a costly save. Silva, a 58th-minute replacement for Leroy San\u00e9, had been on the pitch only a minute when he tried to get past Anderson in the penalty area. Declan Rice, who was being watched by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, was also tracking the City player and it was a questionable decision from the referee, Stuart Attwell.\nSilva appeared to stumble rather than actually being fouled, and the sight of him punching the air at the award of the penalty will not have lessened West Ham\u2019s feelings of injustice. Ag\u00fcero put the penalty to the left of Lukasz Fabianski and, after that, West Ham were indebted to their goalkeeper, particularly for a one-handed save from Sterling that prevented it becoming the kind of scoreline to which City are accustomed at their own ground.",

But for now it is a mostly symbolic gesture, not likely to be taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nEven so, Democrats characterised it as a significant move towards relaxing the gun lobby\u2019s grip on Washington and addressing a national epidemic of gun violence, including the deaths of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, last year that prompted a fresh surge of activism.\nThe bill, HR 8, bans firearms transfers by a person who is not a licensed dealer but its exemptions include \u201cgifts to family members and transfers for hunting, target shooting, and self-defense\u201d, the House judiciary committee website says.\nIn a debate on the House floor on Wednesday, the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said: \u201cHere are the facts: nearly 40,000 lives are cut short every year from gun violence. An average of 47 children and teenagers are killed by guns every single day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the children, the children, the children. We read about the tragic mass murders that have happened in our country and they stir us to action, hopefully. Here it\u2019s been they stir us to a moment of silence, and now finally to action.\u201d\nDemocrats made the case that 97% of Americans support background checks, including 94% of gun-owning households. More than a hundred gun violence survivors, student activists and other campaigners, including Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, watched from the House gallery.\nThe bill passed largely along party lines with only eight Republican members voting in favor and two Democrats against. A late, Republican-backed amendment requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to be notified when illegal immigrants attempt to buy a firearm.\nThe bill is the first of two that Democrats are bringing to the House floor this week as part of an effort to tighten gun laws following eight years of Republican control, which in June 2016 saw Democrats stage a sit-in protest over 26 hours. The other would extend the review period for a background check.\nBut neither bill stands much chance of success in the face of the Republican-controlled Senate and veto threats from Donald Trump. John Thune, the Republican majority whip in the Senate, told CNN it is \u201cunlikely\u201d his party will take up the bill for debate any time soon.",

        "content": "Real Madrid 0-3 Barcelona (Bar\u00e7a win 4-1 on agg) Su\u00e1rez 50, 72; Varane 69og\nFor Barcelona, there is something about the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. They came to the home of their greatest rivals needing a victory to take them to a record sixth consecutive Copa del Rey final and while that task may appear titanic for most teams, Bar\u00e7a are not most teams: they have made a habit of silencing this stadium and they did so againon Wednesday, two goals from Luis Su\u00e1rez and an own goal from Rapha\u00ebl Varane completing a 3-0 win to go with the 6-2, 4-3, 3-2, 4-0 and 3-1 victories they have collected here in the last decade.\nIf those were successes secured on a superiority that was often startling, this was different, but in the end Barcelona went through. They had struggled for an hour but survived and prevailed. It was not easy to explain, except through extreme efficiency: two of Barcelona\u2019s four shots were on target and they scored three. Madrid had 14 in total and did not score.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we wanted to reach the final. We fell with honour: we weren\u2019t ruthless, they were very ruthless,\u201d the Madrid manager, Santi Solari, said. The Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, admitted his team had not always played well but had displayed \u201cpegada\u201d \u2013 the knockout punch.\nNor was this about a familiar genius: so dependent on Lionel Messi lately, this time his influence was largely incidental; instead, the combination of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Su\u00e1rez, neither of whom were especially sparkling in truth, defeated Madrid. The Uruguayan has scored 11 in 13 cl\u00e1sicos.\nUntil Su\u00e1rez scored the first goal a little after half-time, that appeared barely plausible. Madrid, who had the advantage of an away goal from the 1-1 first-leg draw, seemed more likely to progress, their path to the final passing through Vinicius, the 18-year-old who has revived their season. But if the threat was always there, it went unrealised. Barcelona for their part threatened rarely but when they struck they were deadly.\nIt had started with Vinicius\u2019s early flick sending Sergio Reguil\u00f3n up the left, Barcelona turned for the first but not the last time, Karim Benzema usually the man making sense of the runs around him. Vinicius drew a penalty appeal; shot just over and had another effort blocked by Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen. Then the Brazilian, hyperactive, dashed through and eventually found Benzema, only for the Frenchman\u2019s weak shot to hit the keeper. Within a minute, the Brazilian hit over on the turn from close range.\nBy half-time, there had been no goals \u2013 not normal for a cl\u00e1sico, 50 of them passing without a 0-0. Nor was the solitary Barcelona shot, if it could be called that: an Ivan Rakitic drive quickly closed down. But then, five minutes after the restart, they got the opener. Jordi Alba slotted the ball to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 who pulled it back and Su\u00e1rez, swifter and more alert than Sergio Ramos, steered a superb first-time shot into the net.\nMadrid chased the equaliser, Sergio Busquets sliding in to stop Vinicius after he brilliantly turned away from Piqu\u00e9 and Sergio Reguil\u00f3n\u2019s cross just evading Lucas V\u00e1zquez before Dani Carvajal\u2019s shot was saved and a another Vinicius run concluded with the ball squirming wide. Gareth Bale watched from the touchline. He was introduced to applause but a few whistles too, quickly followed by a cheer from the other end where the hundred or so Barcelona fans saw Semedo find Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. His sharp ball into the six-yard box sought Su\u00e1rez but found Varane, diving in, and the ball rebounded into the net.\nSu\u00e1rez scored again two minutes later. Brought down by Casemiro, he got up and dinked in a Panenka penalty that took Barcelona to the cup final.",

        "content": "Fourth ODI: England 418-6; West Indies 389\n England win by 29 runs and lead series 2-1 with one to play\nThe steel band tinkled away all day here but Jos Buttler and Chris Gayle were dancing to the beat of their own drums on Wednesday.\nOn a heart-breaking pitch for bowlers Buttler served up a career-best 150 from 77 balls that powered England to 418 for six \u2013 their highest total overseas. Gayle\u2019s 162 from 97 in reply meant the fourth one-day international somehow, incredibly, finished a mere 29-run win for the tourists, who take a 2-1 lead into Saturday\u2019s finale in St Lucia.\nWhen Jason Holder asked England to bat first, few could have predicted they would go on to clear the boundary rope 24 times, breaking the record of 23 sixes set by the hosts a week ago. West Indies looked gone at the halfway stage, their bowlers having been utterly pummelled.\nMount Gayle was always liable to erupt on this volcanic island, however, the 39-year-old cracking a 25th century in the format in 55 balls. His blitz of 11 fours and 14 sixes took West Indies to 124 required from the final 15.5 overs before Ben Stokes, smashed up to this point, finally got the ball past the middle of his blade for a clean bowled.\nHow this breakthrough was needed for a wilting England attack \u2013 all bar Mark Wood, that is, whose career-best four for 60 included Darren Bravo and the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer in the space of three balls. The former had made 61 from No 4 in a stand of 177 with Gayle, the latter caught trying to repeat a remarkable first-ball six.\nCarlos Brathwaite was determined to take this game deep, putting on 88 with Ashley Nurse to get to 29 needed from 16 balls. With Wood and Chris Woakes bowled out, \u2013 the latter for figures of none for 91 \u2013 Eoin Morgan boldly tossed the ball to Adil Rashid, who followed an earlier stumping of Jason Holder with the scalps of both batsmen in a four-wicket 48th over that finally ended this mind-bending match.\n\u201cThat\u2019s as tough a day as we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt was 100-odd overs of pure, intense, crazy cricket. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve never come up against before. I was reasonably calm at the end but we needed something special to turn the tide.\n\u201cRashid was definitely going to bowl a late over. He was calm and produced under pressure. I\u2019d have taken two wickets but to finish off ... incredible.\n\u201cAnd to have Jos in our side is to have one of the world\u2019s best. He\u2019s destructive and a match-winner.\u201d\nSuch was the earlier violence from Buttler \u2013 he had needed 15 balls after a 45-ball half-century to reach three figures and 16 more to make his maiden 150 \u2013 that a sizzling 103 from 88 by the in-form Morgan and the opener Alex Hales striking 82 from 73 on his return to international action were somehow eclipsed when England batted first.\nHe cleared the rope 12 times, breaking his own English record of eight during a 46-ball hundred against Pakistan in 2015, and once again those supreme wrists were at play. He took particular delight in slotting the bowlers back over their heads and a cheeky salute to Sheldon Cottrell after one such missile \u2013 copying the Jamaican left-armer\u2019s military celebration from last Friday\u2019s thriller in Barbados \u2013 was just about fair enough.\nIn passing the 399 for nine made in Bloemfontein three years ago \u2013 their previous best on the road \u2013 England put on 154 in the last 10 overs, 19 more than during the latter stages of last summer\u2019s world record 481 for six against Australia. Truly this team knows no limits with bat in hand.\nThe platform for the late power-hitting, a score of 264 for three after 40 overs, owed much to Morgan\u2019s insistence on keeping the pedal to the metal in the middle overs after yet another breakneck start from his openers.\nOn this occasion, after Jason Roy reported tightness in his left hamstring, it was Hales who walked out with Jonny Bairstow, before watching on from the other end as the Yorkshire man creamed a half-century from 31 balls.\nAn early experiment with the slow bowlers during the powerplay led to West Indies leaking 48 from four overs, with Bairstow clubbing Devendra Bishoo for three successive sixes.\nBairstow eventually chopped on to his stumps for 56, the first of two quick wickets for the brawny Oshane Thomas, who soon had Joe Root flashing behind on five. Hales, now well into his work and combining late dabs with some meaty slogs over midwicket, was then joined by a bristling Morgan.\nWhen Hales fell in search of a third six, caught by a running Hetmyer off Nurse, and Buttler strode out as a promoted No 5, Morgan was 20 not out. Though the senior man was striking them cleanly, passing 50 for the seventh time in 10 innings and becoming the first England batsman past 6,000 ODI runs, Buttler reached his century first.\nThere was one reprieve for him, on 93, dropped in the deep by John Campbell. But when a batsman has hit his previous 10 balls to or over the rope, such luck is sometimes earned. After reaching his century from 60 balls \u2013 four of his seven ODI tons have come in under 70 \u2013 it was over to Morgan, his sixth six bringing up three figures from 86 before eventually holing out attempting a seventh.\nButtler did not look back, launching the 24th six of the innings for his 150 before being bowled next ball by Brathwaite.\nWood struck with the new ball \u2013 Campbell picking out Root in the deep and Shai Hope caught behind \u2013 but Gayle, fresh from scores of 135 and 50 in Barbados, was already up and running for what proved a remarkable, if doomed chase by West Indies.",

Yes, he\u2019s moved to Cheshire, fathered a child and is now hobnobbing with Prince Charles \u2013 but in this new touring show, his standup is as much of a whirlwind as when he won the Edinburgh comedy award almost a decade ago.\nWhich is just as well, because there are times in The Fast and the Curious when it\u2019s his hyperactive manner that makes an impression rather than the jokes. His gags about binary personality types, drawing on his opposites-attract relationship with wife Lindsey, rely on strenuous generalisations. The Mallorca holiday routine recycles well-worn Brits-on-the-piss cliches. His contribution to that burgeoning standup sub-genre, the anecdote about going weak-kneed in the presence of royalty, conforms to starstruck convention.\nBut these lapses in comic quality are seldom keenly felt, because our host works tirelessly to bring the material to over-stimulated life. Characters \u2013 including his macho Essex dad, a staple of Kane\u2019s earlier shows \u2013 are splayed across the stage like cartoons. Lindsey is a Mancunian accent \u2013 and attitude \u2013 gone (champagne) supernova. Daughter Mina is a malevolent sprite, whose breath-holding condition wreaks havoc in supermarkets.\nKane\u2019s operatic vomiting routine is revived from his 2016 show, but its pop-eyed, lung-busting body horror justifies a second viewing. Elsewhere, he\u2019s forever clenching his \u201csecret fist\u201d in suppressed fury, at people who take baths, say, or at attention-seekers (himself included) on social media.\nThe show is bound together only by its cast of recurring characters, the most prominent being Kane himself \u2013 an impatient southerner transplanted to the north, a highly strung husband tethered to a carefree wife, and a slave to the cacophonous overthinking going on inside his head. An opening 10 minutes on our EU turmoil \u2013 from the \u201cbi-Brexional\u201d perspective of a working-class boy turned liberal elitist \u2013 whets the appetite for a show that doesn\u2019t materialise. What we get instead is not Kane\u2019s most ambitious set \u2013 but plenty of laughs are won as he brings marriage, early parenthood and the provinces to Looney Tunes life.\nRussell Kane is touring until 7 December.",

Lennon \u2013 the former Hibernian manager, who was struck by a coin during an Edinburgh derby back in October \u2013 was delighted after James Forrest\u2019s 36th-minute strike. The league leaders were helped further when Brandon appeared to lead with an arm during an aerial challenge on Jeremy Toljan and saw red. Hearts drew level thanks to Oliver Bozanic\u2019s second-half penalty before Odsonne \u00c9douard grabbed a injury-time winner for Celtic.\nThe Celtic manager admitted it had been \u201cnerve-racking\u201d beforehand and was more than glad to get off to a winning start.\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic. It\u2019s a great win at a difficult place under the circumstances. We should have made more of the game. We were a goal up at half-time, but we\u2019ve got to stop the sloppiness playing the ball from the back.\n\u201cWe shot ourselves in the foot and what we did was give Hearts something to hold onto when we should have been in total control of the game.\n\u201cYou never stop believing with this group that they might make something happen. We put a quality ball in for the goal, which was something we lacked at times tonight. \u201cBut I can\u2019t knock the players. The mentality is absolutely brilliant and I can\u2019t fault them tonight. It\u2019s a brilliant win and psychologically huge.\u201d Second-placed Rangers kept up the pressure as they ran out 4-0 winners over Dundee while 10-man Hibernian strengthened their grip on sixth place thanks to two goals from Marc McNulty in a 2-1 comeback victory over St Johnstone. The on-loan Reading striker made it six goals in four matches following his double in Friday\u2019s 4-2 win over Dundee.\nMcNulty calmly drilled in a 65th-minute penalty to cancel out Chris Kane\u2019s 15th-minute opener for the home side, before Hibs midfielder Vykintas Slivka was sent off for a second bookable offence just three minutes later.\nAnd the 26-year-old slotted in the winner with six minutes remaining before the Easter Road side survived a further five minutes of stoppage time to go three points clear of their hosts.\nIt earned Hibs new manager Paul Heckingbottom a third consecutive victory and stretched St Johnstone\u2019s miserable run to eight games without a win.\nReferee John Beaton admitted he had no option but to abandon the match between Motherwell and Kilmarnock at Rugby Park after visiting fans left him in no doubt they could not see the game. Heavy fog descended towards the end of a goalless first half and worsened during the interval. Beaton called a halt within seconds and the game was abandoned 12 minutes later The referee said: \u201cI think the Motherwell fans told us that they could not see the game and that was the first sign of a problem. Both assistant referees told me that they could not see the opposite side of the field.\u201d\nHamilton scored a goal either side of half-time to register a surprise 2-0 away win at Aberdeen.",

The US has said it would take up to 1,200, but advocates and refugees have become distressed at the pace, as well as frequent rejections.\n\u201cThe US deal is glacially slow,\u201d said Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition.\n\u201cAt the present rate of resettlement, it will be another four years before the remaining refugees would be resettled in the US.\u201d\nAccording to the Australian-run refugee support group Ads-Up (Aussie Diaspora Steps Up), one of the Nauru families has flown to Colorado and another to Texas. All are expected to repay the cost of their transfer to the US within four years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard on families. There\u2019s one family \u2026 their debt is US$12,000,\u201d said Fleur Wood, the cofounder of Ads-Up, which connects Australians living in the US with recently resettled refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, providing support and friendship.\n\u201cA debt like that is overwhelming for refugees. They have four years to pay it off but when you\u2019re earning $7 an hour \u2026 a debt like that is really crippling. It stops them being able to do things to get ahead in life.\u201d\nThe US state department has been contacted for comment.\nAustralia\u2019s immigration minister, David Coleman, said the transfer illustrated a successful approach to border policy.\n\u201cThis is something the government has been working on for some time, quietly and in a way that would not impact our border protection policies,\u201d Coleman said.\n\u201cOur track record on this issue is clear and it is a massive contrast with what was seen under the previous Labor government.\u201d\n\u201cBy weakening our borders, Labor put more than 8,000 children in overcrowded onshore detention centres and in regional processing countries.\u201d\nThe Australian government has repeatedly claimed it had removed all children from detention. Children on Nauru were no longer technically living in detention, as families had moved to community accomodation near the centre.\nWidespread cases of mental and physical illness continued among the population of refugees and asylum seekers, and late last year an intense campaign by charities, businesses and NGOs called for all children and their families to be taken off the island.\nOne of the architects of the US deal, then US assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, Anne Richard, has previously told Guardian Australia the US was motivated to get people off Manus Island and Nauru because of the widely reported conditions which were \u201cquite bad, and over the long term, unhealthy\u201d.\nThe US made its offer on the understanding that in exchange Australia would \u201cdo more\u201d to help other refugees.\nIn August, when Scott Morrison became prime minister, there were 109 children still on Nauru.\nAround 970 people remain across the two islands, including 154 who have not been found to be refugees. Senate estimates earlier this month revealed more than 1,240 people have been transferred to Australia for medical treatment since 2014, and only 282 have returned.\nIn many cases people were brought to Australia for urgent treatment only after legal intervention \u2013 with the department transferring them either on agreement before it reached court or under court orders after having argued against the transfer request.\nThis financial year the department has spent $1.373m responding to the legal interventions. In the previous financial year the department spent $275,000.\nLabor\u2019s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said the resettlement of the last refugee children from Nauru was \u201cgood and overdue news\u201d but he criticised a lack of any \u201clong-term plan\u201d for the hundreds now in Australia.\n\u201cScott Morrison and Peter Dutton have absolutely failed to secure viable third-country resettlement for people on Nauru and in PNG for close to six years, leaving them to languish in indefinite detention because of these failures,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAustralians understand our nation can be strong on borders and still treat people humanely.\nMorrison should start by immediately accepting New Zealand\u2019s offer to resettle refugees and negotiate appropriate conditions similar to those under the US arrangements, he said.\nIn a bilateral meeting with the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, last week, Morrison said his government had no intention of accepting the country\u2019s offer.",

In circumstances that remain unclear, at least two trucks carrying the aid caught fire during the violence.\nFootage broadcast on Colombian television on Wednesday showed a burned-out truck bed in front of the shipping containers, which had been positioned overnight across the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge.\nLast month, Venezuelan authorities barricaded the nearby Tienditas bridge with two containers and an oil truck. That bridge was finished in 2016 but never inaugurated.\nThe Colombian border has been closed to most vehicles since 2015 following a string of disputes between the two countries, and on Saturday Maduro closed all Venezuela\u2019s borders.\nColombia closed four crossings from its side on Saturday evening, reopening them on Monday afternoon.\nSaturday\u2019s aid effort was intended to weaken Maduro by triggering a flood of military defections. That did not happen, but Colombian migration authorities reported that around 250 military officials have crossed the border, joining a steady stream of Venezuelan refugees leaving the country via unpoliced routes.\nAfter Saturday\u2019s violence, Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 who has been recognized as Venezuela\u2019s rightful president by the US and 50 other countries \u2013 travelled to Bogot\u00e1 and met with the US vice-president, Mike Pence, and Latin American leaders.\nGuaid\u00f3, who was officially barred from travel, was set to arrive in Brazil late on Wednesday for a meeting with the far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken opponent of Maduro.\nMaduro\u2019s vice-president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, will travel to Moscow for talks with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Friday. Russia has been among Maduro\u2019s staunchest allies during the crisis.\nMeanwhile, unrest continued near Venezuela\u2019s eastern border with Brazil after violence that left at least three people dead and dozens injured over the weekend.\nOn Tuesday morning, soldiers took control of an airport in the town of Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n, which was the focus of clashes between Venezuelan soldiers and indigenous protesters.\nWitnesses say they were attempting to travel to Maurak, where members of the Pemon indigenous community had captured 30 soldiers on Saturday.",

The office was later forced to concede the data it had used was significantly flawed as advocates argued it discriminated against Hispanic Americans.\nThe move prompted three legal challenges from civil rights groups targeting several counties in Texas with Biery\u2019s order effectively stopping the entire state from requesting proof of citizenship or purging voters without informing the court first. The order will remain in effect until the legal challenge is fully argued.\nThe thousands of voters identified by the secretary of state\u2019s office were individuals who recently had registered as non-citizens when applying for or renewing their driver\u2019s license. The office later conceded that around a quarter of those flagged were naturalized citizens and, during court proceedings, accepted there were probably many more on the list who were now US citizens.\nIn a rebuke to the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office, Biery said in his ruling that the process \u201cwas inherently paved with flawed results, meaning perfectly legal naturalized Americans were burdened with what the court finds to be ham-handed and threatening correspondence from the state\u201d.\nThe judge added that the secretary of state\u2019s office \u201cdid not politely ask for information\u201d but instead used \u201cthe power of government to strike fear and anxiety and to intimidate the least powerful among us. No native born Americans were subjected to such treatment.\u201d\nThomas Buser-Clancy, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas said the order was \u201can extremely important ruling to help prevent eligible voters in Texas from getting kicked off the voter rolls\u201d.\nSam Taylor, communications director for the Texas secretary of state, said the office was now \u201cpreparing a communication to Texas counties\u201d following the ruling.\n\u201cSecretary [David] Whitley met personally with representatives of the plaintiffs today, solicited their feedback, and made clear that every option is on the table,\u201d Taylor said.",

However, a handful of Brexiter Conservatives unexpectedly objected, forcing a vote. The plan was passed by 502 votes to 20.\nCooper, who has spearheaded cross-party efforts to ensure MPs are able to block a no-deal departure, praised the government\u2019s agreement as \u201ca very significant change\u201d, but said she and the co-leaders of her campaign would maintain pressure on May to keep to her word.\nMinisters also agreed to a parallel amendment by the Conservative MP Caroline Spelman on the same subject, which was passed without a vote, as was the plan tabled by Costa.\nWith just five amendments selected by the Speaker, John Bercow, this meant that as well as the Labour and Cooper amendments, only one more was voted on: an SNP-led plan to completely rule out no deal, which was easily defeated.\nIn another, albeit more minor, sign of government confusion, the beleaguered transport secretary, Chris Grayling, was spotted entering the wrong voting lobby before realising his error.\nThe main government concession was announced in the debate\u2019s opening speech by the cabinet office minister David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy. He said the government would back Costa\u2019s amendment, which had been signed by 135 MPs, among them many Conservatives \u2013 a clear sign it would pass anyway.\nIt decrees that the government should guarantee the rights of EU nationals as soon as possible \u201cwhatever the outcome of negotiations\u201d on Brexit.\nLidington said: \u201cIn view of the fact our political objectives are the same, the government will accept the amendment today and take it up with the commission.\u201d\nThe concession did not save Costa\u2019s junior government job. Shortly before the debate he stepped down as the parliamentary private secretary to the Scotland secretary, David Mundell.\nWhile a Downing Street spokesman said Costa had decided himself to resign due to the \u201clongstanding convention\u201d that MPs on the government payroll do not table amendments to official bills, a source close to the MP said he had effectively been sacked.\nCosta, the son of Italian immigrants, has been quietly lobbying May over EU citizens\u2019 rights for two years.\nHe later said he did not \u201cgive a stuff\u201d about having to quit his post as PPS, when citizens\u2019 rights were at stake.\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a stuff about being a junior aide. It\u2019s about the rights of five million people\u201cIf I had to resign for that - so be it\u201d says \u2066\u2066@AlbertoCostaMP\u2069 pic.twitter.com/Wz6UcyO5dM\nAdding to the confusion, the home secretary Sajid Javid seemed to pre-empt Lidington\u2019s concession before the debate, using an earlier appearance before the home affairs select committee to say he had no objection to the amendment.\nOn being told that the government disagreed, Javid appeared flummoxed. \u201cWhen did you hear that? From who?\u201d he asked. When told it was the prime minister, Javid replied: \u201cDid you? Right, OK.\u201d\nThe shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, branded the events leading up to the debate a \u201cshambles\u201d, saying it was a \u201cvignette on how Brexit has been going\u201d. He said the government was \u201cno closer to making progress\u201d since the last Brexit motion two weeks ago.\nLidington also used his statement to stress his concerns about no deal. \u201cThere is no avoiding the fact that an abrupt departure from the European Union without an agreement of any kind would lead to a shock to our economy, and that it would not be possible for a government \u2013 even with the most meticulous planning of arrangements in this country \u2013 to mitigate and plan entirely for what might be happening outwith our own jurisdiction,\u201d he said.\nSumming up for the government, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said ministers would honour the commitments of Cooper\u2019s amendment. \u201cThey are commitments made by my right honourable friend the prime minister, and the government will stick by them,\u201d he said.\nAsked by Cooper in an intervention about reported comments from Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, that no deal could still happen even if MPs voted against it, Barclay reiterated his guarantee.",

It took half an hour from kick-off for the Tottenham fans to find the best joke to date about Chelsea\u2019s latest psychodrama on the theme of authority and control.\nAnd yet by the end that wheel had turned completely. It was instead the Chelsea fans who cheered their team and taunted the away support, after a performance of fire and purpose by a team that is constantly in the process of dying and resurrecting itself, west London\u2019s own zombie FC.\nAs expected, Maurizio Sarri had left Kepa Arrizabalaga out of his starting side. Kepa sat on the bench instead. Before kick-off, the goalkeeper helped warm up his replacement, Willy Caballero, a 37-year-old whose last real run at being a No 1 was at last summer\u2019s World Cup, where he kept goal like an arthritic alpaca for Argentina, the punchline to the universal joke of Lionel Messi\u2019s stricken brilliance in such a flawed and fumbling team. No matter. Chelsea dressing-room revolts come and go but that blue machine keeps on rolling along. Odd as it might sound, a 2-0 win leaves Chelsea seven points behind erstwhile title-challengers Tottenham with a game in hand.\nThere will be a temptation to style this win as a reaction to the dropping of Kepa, a message sent out to the squad, a manager flexing his muscles and all the rest of it. But when has this club ever stuck to such a hackneyed script? This is Chelsea, where the world keeps on ending, where things fall apart every six months, but still people keep on turning up asking where the party is.\nIt is probably best to get the Willy-watch stuff out of the way first thing. Chelsea\u2019s No 2 keeper had cut a haunting figure on that Wembley touchline on Sunday, stoop-shouldered in his lime green two-piece, a ghost-player whose un-substitution will forever be asterisked on the record of that day.\nHis first real moment on Wednesday came on 27 minutes as he punched Antonio R\u00fcdiger in the head clearing the ball. Towards half-time Caballero was smacked in the face by a close-range shot. Briefly you wondered if he was concussed. Would he perhaps refuse to come off? Would we see Kepa on the touchline looking lost and empty, while Caballero airily dismissed the subs board?\nNot this time, sadly. But something has clearly stirred, because Chelsea were excellent. They took the game to Tottenham with a fury from the start. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn spanked a shot on to the post. David Luiz ragged Harry Kane to the ground. Eden Hazard sniped about in his No 10 role. Twelve minutes into the second half Pedro scored a beautifully worked opener, followed at the end by a horrible, slow-motion Kieran Trippier own goal.\nSarri on his touchline rose cautiously now and then, slightly bent in his navy padded suit. The Kepa incident seems to have lent him an extra veneer of quiet dignity. Sarri may well still be on his way out. But he has something of the wronged, dying patriarch about him now. At the very least the inquest will be kinder. Imagine trying to impose a detailed tactical system on a group that will not come off the pitch even when you ask them.\nThree days later, the Kepa incident still looks remarkable. It was one of those moments where football seems to sag in the middle, the doors falling off, engine parping, custard coming out of the exhaust pipe. But with a little distance two things are clear.\nFirst, there are no random moments in sport. The Kepa protest stinks of something wider; failure that stretches back up the arm and into the bigger picture of how the club is managed and run. Chelsea have teetered on the edge of madness, simultaneously a brilliantly well-run machine and an oligarchy of influences and power plays. Now and then the wild things have taken charge. Sarri has been there seven months. This is hardly his doing.\nSecond, the Kepa affair has overshadowed some actual progress. Sarri, the man who never budges, has found a way of re-balancing this team. Jorginho played well here, passing the ball a little quicker. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 has been effective in his minutely rejigged but highly controversial role slightly to the right. Hazard\u2019s weakness as a defender has been camouflaged by playing him further forward.\nMost notably Sarri is still standing. He has seemed to flicker and fade on the touchline at times, has been portrayed as an absurd Monsieur Hulot-type bungler.\nThe level of bile directed his way is salutary. A highfalutin European, unapologetically wedded to his own ideas. Rarely has anyone pressed quite so many tender points in the English football psyche.\nAnd yet Sarri has regained a kind of strength in the past few days, has seemed calmer and more sure-footed as the level of dysfunction around him has revealed itself. Defiance is the Chelsea way. For the first time, Sarri seemed to have borrowed a little of that himself.",

NHS England hopes the pilots will show health professionals the best way to treat those with diabulimia.\nAn estimated 42,000 women and 13,000 men in England who have type 1 diabetes \u2013 the autoimmune version of the disease, which is not linked to lifestyle \u2013 also have diabulimia. People with type 2 diabetes cannot get it.\nProf Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for diabetes and obesity, said: \u201cAs a diabetes clinician I\u2019ve seen first-hand the devastating impact that this condition can have on people and their families, and so these services are an important step forward in the recognition of diabulimia.\u201d\nMany people with diabulimia do not tell friends and family they are not taking regular doses of insulin, which adds to the difficulties NHS staff face in spotting those who have it.\nMost type 1 diabetics who skip doses of insulin do so to reduce the weight gain that taking it can involve.\nDiabetes UK said: \u201cDiabulimia is serious, but it\u2019s not a recognised mental health condition in its own right. And because it isn\u2019t widely understood, some healthcare professionals may not spot the signs or know how to support someone with it.\u201d\nThe Labour MP George Howarth has been campaigning to raise awareness of diabulimia since his daughter Sian died from it aged 24 in 2011.\nDr Dasha Nicholls, the chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 eating disorders faculty, said: \u201cBecause diabetes forces you to focus on what you eat, it is not unusual for that to get tangled up with feelings about food, weight and body image.\n\u201cBut in the case of diabetes that can become dangerous very quickly, because of the impact on blood sugar levels.\u201d\nWelcoming the announcement, Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at the eating disorders charity Beat, said: \u201cStandard treatments for people with eating disorders often don\u2019t provide the right support for people who also have diabetes, who may experience additional issues including the misuse of insulin and its extremely serious consequences.\u201d",

However, it warned against \u201carbitrary limits that risk driving customers to the unregulated and illegal gambling market\u201d.\nWatson has already had some success with policies announced last year following a party review that called for a \u201cwhistle-to-whistle\u201d ban on gambling ads during live sports broadcasts, and an end to the use of credit cards to place bets.\nThe industry has since volunteered to stop advertising during sport, while the government has asked the industry regulator to review whether gambling on credit should be banned.\nCalls for a radical rethink of gambling laws follow a series of cases that fuelled concern about the behaviour of online casinos and bookmakers.\nThey include Ladbrokes agreeing to pay \u00a31m to the victims of a problem gambler who had stolen money to bet, on condition that they did not tell the Gambling Commission, the industry regulator.\nThe commission said: \u201cThe online gambling sector is tightly regulated and we continue to review and develop our regulations with new technology and innovation in mind.\n\u201cThis is a stringent regime which has allowed us to take action against operators who don\u2019t offer the best possible safety and protection for consumers. One example is our ongoing robust regulatory action against the online casino sector which has so far resulted in \u00a314m in penalties.\u201d\nThe level of financial penalties issued by the commission, including those relating to offline bets, has risen steadily from \u00a35.2m in 2016 to \u00a310.8m the following year and \u00a328m in 2018.\nLabour said it would launch a consultation about the relationship between video games and gambling, particularly betting-style features such as \u201cskins\u201d and \u201cloot boxes\u201d.",

Speaking after three teenagers died in knife attacks in two weeks in Birmingham, David Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, called for additional funding to combat the problem.\n\u201cWe must do something about [school exclusions] because those children are on an almost immediate path into crime and into violence,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly we\u2019ve got a very high level of crime here, there\u2019s no escaping that \u2013 and they\u2019ve got a real problem in parts of London.\u201d\nFor the report, researchers asked 25 safeguarding boards in high-risk areas what they knew about the number of children either involved or at risk of becoming involved with gangs.\n\u201cThe response was deeply concerning,\u201d Longfield said. \u201cNot one of them was able to give adequate answers to all of our questions, while several areas with the highest indicators of gang violence had no estimate at all of levels of gang violence.\u201d\nLongfield pointed to parallels with child sexual exploitation a decade ago, before children were recognised as victims, when authorities turned a blind eye to widescale abuse.\n\u201cMany local areas are not facing up to the scale of the problem, they are not taking notice of the risk factors in front of them and they are not listening to parents and communities who ask for help,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe government and local areas need to face up to the scale of this challenge and ensure the priority and resources are allocated to helping these children, because it is clear to me that we are not doing enough to protect them from harm.\u201d\nThe research looked at the characteristics of children at risk of becoming involved in gangs. Compared with other children known to social services or other child offenders, they were more likely to have social, emotional and mental health issues, to be self-harming, to have a parent misusing substances or to be misusing themselves, to have witnessed domestic violence and to be out of school.\nThe report highlights increases in early warning signs of gang violence. Permanent exclusions from school rose by 67% in the four years to 2016/17, while referrals to children\u2019s services due to gang issues rose by 26% between 2015/16 and 2016/17.\nHospital admissions for children assaulted with a sharp object rose by 20% between 2015/16 and 2016/17, and the number of children cautioned or convicted for possession of weapons offences rose by 12% between 2016 and 2017.\nThe report calls on the government to make child criminal exploitation a national priority and to lay out clear expectations about the role of the police, schools, children\u2019s services and NHS bodies.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to protecting vulnerable children by cracking down on the ruthless gangs \u2026 That is why we launched the serious violence strategy, which puts a greater focus on early intervention alongside a tough law enforcement response.\n\u201cWe have proposed a new statutory duty on partners across education, social services and health to work together to tackle violence as part of a public health approach, and are providing \u00a3220m to support children and young people at risk of becoming involved in violence and gangs.\u201d",

It will not give its name to the award, which will revert to its old name of the Booker prize from 1 June, when the Man Group\u2019s sponsorship ends.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the Booker Prize Foundation said there were no plans to change the \u00a350,000 winner\u2019s purse, or its recent expansion to include any English-language novel published in the UK. The prize for literature in translation will be known as the International Booker prize from June, and will continue to award \u00a325,000 each to the winning author and their translator.\nMoritz, a venture capitalist whose net worth is estimated to be $3.4bn (\u00a32.5bn), established Crankstart with his wife, the American writer Heyman, in 2000 to support \u201cthe forgotten, the dispossessed, the unfortunate, the oppressed and causes where some help makes all the difference\u201d. Recent donations include \u00a375m to Oxford University in 2012, to support poorer students in taking up places to study and inspired, said Moritz at the time, by the generosity of strangers in England who took in his parents as Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.\n\u201cNeither of us can imagine a day where we don\u2019t spend time reading a book. The Booker prizes are ways of spreading the word about the insights, discoveries, pleasures and joy that spring from great fiction,\u201d said Moritz, who was born in Wales, studied at Oxford and now lives in San Francisco.\nPreviously, Moritz worked as a journalist for Time magazine, writing a biography of Steve Jobs and Apple before turning to technology investment. He has been a partner at Sequoia Capital since 1986 and invested $25m in what was then the tech startup Google in 1999. His recent work as an author includes co-authoring Leading with former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.\n\u201cThese days I\u2019m a global traveller but, just like the Booker, I was born in Britain and before coming to America was reared on English literature. Harriet and I feel fortunate to be able to support prizes that together celebrate the best fiction in the world,\u201d he added.\nMan Group, a hedge fund, had sponsored the award since 2002, but announced its withdrawal in late January. Accounts filed with the Charity Commission showed that Man Group had provided \u00a31.5m funding a year to the Booker Prize Foundation. Organisers said on Wednesday that they had been informed Man\u2019s sponsorship would be coming to an end in the summer of 2018 \u2013 \u201cbefore Sebastian Faulks described Man as the enemy\u201d in press reports.\nAsked whether it was appropriate for the British literary institution to be sponsored by a Silicon Valley billionaire, the Booker Prize Foundation said it was \u201cconfident that, in Crankstart, it has found a sympathetic and reputable philanthropic funder which shares BPF\u2019s values and vision\u201d.\nMultiple interested parties inquired about sponsoring the prize once it emerged that Man was withdrawing. Helena Kennedy, chair of the Booker\u2019s trustees, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t find it difficult to find people to have conversations with. It was about finding the right match, and people who were interested in it for the right kinds of reasons.\u201dShe described Moritz and Heyman as \u201creal book lovers\u201d: \u201cMany commercial sponsors want opportunities to use the thing for purposes like bringing their guests to the dinner. They are not interested in any of that. Their interest is sustaining good literature.\u201d\nKennedy said that renaming the prize the Crankstart Booker was never suggested: \u201cMichael and Harriet made it very clear that putting names all over things was not their thing. One of the things we love about it is we\u2019re going back to being the Booker prize.\u201d\nThe Booker had been much criticised by both authors and the publishing industry for the decision to open it up to anyone writing in English and published in the UK. Former winner Peter Carey called it \u201can exercise in global corporate branding\u201d, while 30 publishers last year told organisers that the rule change allows \u201cthe dominance of Anglo-American writers at the expense of others\u201d.\nBut the Booker Prize Foundation confirmed that \u201ca sponsor or funder has no say over the rules\u201d, and \u201cthere is no plan to reverse the rule\u201d.\n\u201cWe made that shift, it didn\u2019t make everybody happy, but we\u2019re staying with that,\u201d said Kennedy, stressing that the foundation was keen to \u201cmake sure small publishing houses get their crack at this as well\u201d.\nWhen it announced that its sponsorship of the prize was ending, chief executive Luke Ellis said that while it had been a privilege to sponsor the Booker, \u201cfollowing a careful review of our funding initiatives\u201d it would be focusing its resources elsewhere.\nThe change comes during a period of upheaval for literary awards. In early February, the Folio prize announced a \u201csubstantially increased sponsorship pledge\u201d from Rathbones Investment Management, which increased its prize cheque to \u00a330,000 from \u00a320,000.\nThe Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction, previously the Samuel Johnson prize, announced in February that it had a new seven-year sponsorship agreement from the investment partnership that would increase prize money from \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000.\nAnd the Women\u2019s prize for fiction, which was sponsored by Orange until 2012, then by Baileys, and now by a group of brands and businesses from different sectors, also announced this month that it had been awarded charitable status, introducing a patron scheme to recruit individual donors.",

        "content": "English collective says laws forcing women to work alone expose them to violence\nProstitution should be decriminalised in the UK to make it safer for vulnerable women, a sex worker organisation has said.\nThe English Collective of Prostitutes is calling for the removal of laws relating to consensual adult sexual behaviour, arguing that the legislation forces sex workers to operate alone, leaving them vulnerable to crime and reluctant to report violence to the police because they fear arrest.\nNiki Adams, a spokeswoman for the collective, said female sex workers were forced to work in isolation. \u201cOne woman working alone was viciously attacked, raped and beaten. The case went to court and the man was convicted but the woman then thought: \u2018I never want to work alone again.\u2019 She started working from another woman\u2019s flat, and within a few months the place was raided by police \u2026 The women were arrested for brothel-keeping. That woman spent months and months before the case came to court and was dropped at the last minute due to a big campaign by us highlighting how outrageous [it was] that women working together were prosecuted.\u201d\nShe said the pattern was common and, while working alone was dangerous, working together put women at risk of arrest.\nAdams said it was something police were increasingly cracking down on. \u201cWe get complaints over and over again, sometimes individually and sometimes using collective examples in the media, and there are implications for safety.\u201d\nShe said the phenomenon of \u201cpop-up brothels\u201d was caused by the forced closure of existing ones as a result of police actions.\nAdams said the number of women involved in sex work had increased under austerity, although there were no official figures on this. \u201cIn Doncaster there has been a 60% increase since benefit sanctions hit [according to local charities]. In Sheffield it\u2019s been 166%, which is massive \u2026 and this is from outreach workers, who are not likely to be sensationalist,\u201d she said.\nShe noted that some charities had reported women starving on the streets, unable to eat for several days, and others who had previously given up prostitution calling the helpline to say they had been forced to go back.\n\u201cOne woman was stripping but was about to move on to universal credit, which means her income would drop by a third. She was crying on the phone and working out [what to do].\u201d\nThe announcement comes ahead of International Sex Workers\u2019 Rights Day, an annual event on 3 March. The government is about to publish research it commissioned on sex workers in coming months.\nIn 2016, the home affairs select committee recommended decriminalising prostitution. The interim report on prostitution said the Home Office should immediately change the legislation so that soliciting was no longer an offence, and change brothel-keeping laws to allow sex workers to share premises without losing the ability to prosecute those who used brothels to control or exploit sex workers.\nJeremy Corbyn has previously said he is in favour of decriminalising the sex industry. On the campaign trail for the 2016 general election, the Labour leader said: \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be criminalised. I want to be [in] a society where we don\u2019t automatically criminalise people. Let\u2019s do things a bit differently and in a bit more civilised way.\u201d\nThe Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Jess Phillips both criticised the comments.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have no plans to change the law around prostitution, but we recognise the need for more evidence in this area.\nThat is why we are funding research into the scale and nature of prostitution in England and Wales \u2026 The government is also providing \u00a3100m in funding to tackle all forms of violence against women and girls.\u201d",

        "content": "A new book by lexicographer Susan Rennie collects the author\u2019s nonsensical insults and expletives, celebrating \u2018words that push the boundaries a little bit\u2019\nIf a small child were to walk up to the lexicographer Susan Rennie in the street and call her a slopgroggled grobsquiffler, she would know exactly how to reply. \u201cYou squinky squiddler!\u201d she would shout. \u201cYou piffling little swishfiggler! You troggy little twit! Don\u2019t you dare talk pigsquiffle to me, you prunty old pogswizzler!\u201d\nEither that, or she would thank the child profusely for taking the time to read her latest book, Roald Dahl\u2019s Rotsome and Repulsant Words. Ostensibly a children\u2019s dictionary of Dahl\u2019s insults and expletives, the book also offers a chance to explore and analyse Dahl\u2019s creative use of language, encouraging Dahl lovers of any age to have fun playing with his naughty-sounding words.\n\u201cChildren and grownups alike are fascinated by words that push the boundaries a little bit \u2013 and Dahl, in his language as much as in his characters and his plots, always has a twinkle in his eye,\u201d says Rennie. \u201cChildren are not going to get into trouble by using these words. But at the same time, they\u2019re fun to say and they\u2019re very powerful. I think we, as grownups, sometimes forget how much fun language can be, especially when you make words up.\u201d\nDahl created more than 300 words, she says, and sets a liberating example to anyone whose creativity with words was \u2013 or is \u2013 stifled at school: \u201cWe know from looking at children\u2019s writing how naturally creative children are with words, how much they love chopping words up and combining them to make new words. Dahl does that, and this book encourages children to carry on doing that, to keep going with what they enjoy doing naturally with language and to be creative.\u201d\nLike Lewis Carroll before him, the techniques Dahl used to invent words are built firmly on the existing traditions of the English language. For example, to make his rude \u201cgobblefunk\u201d easily understood by children, Dahl relies on reduplication (\u201cucky-mucky\u201d), malapropisms (\u201ctummyrot\u201d for \u201ctommyrot\u201d), onomatopoeia (\u201cwhizzpopper\u201d meaning, famously, a sound \u201ceven the Queen\u2019s bottom makes\u201d), portmanteau words (gruesome and rotten combine to create \u201crotsome\u201d); and, most powerfully, alliterative phonaesthesia, where consonant clusters and specific sounds connote meaning to the made-up words.\n\u201cSquinky squiddler\u201d (which the giants in The BFG call something small, squashy and insignificant), \u201ctroggy little twit\u201d (how the giants refer to someone who is vile and horrible, evoking a troll in a bog) and \u201csnozzcumber\u201d (a \u201csickable\u201d, \u201cdisgusterous\u201d cucumber-like vegetable) are just a few examples of this in Dahl\u2019s writing.\nThis is why children understand the meanings, Rennie says. \u201cThat\u2019s why they are so much fun: they are not complete nonsense. On the surface, he seems to be breaking the rules. But dig a little deeper and you realise he\u2019s following standard patterns that people understand intuitively.\u201d\nRennie notes that, just as Dahl learned to make sense of some of the nonsensical words and phrases spoken by his wife, Patricia Neal, after she had a stroke, Sophie in The BFG is quickly able to translate for the BFG.\nAs a bilingual Norwegian and English speaker, Dahl would have been able to look at the construction of English more objectively than monolingual writers, says Michael Rosen, children\u2019s writer and author of The Fantastic Mr Dahl. \u201cIf you are bilingual, it gives you two heads. You have a head you can use to look at the other head. It enables you to see that you\u2019ve got completely different ways of talking about something similar, and that one language might be able to do stuff or describe stuff the other language can\u2019t.\u201d\nHe also credits Dahl\u2019s education at a public school, Repton, for enabling Dahl to realise he could invent his own subversive vernacular: \u201cChildren in boarding schools often set up little coteries, partly to defend themselves against the authoritarianism of those schools with their own private language. Often, it\u2019s elitist, but with Dahl the nice thing is that he wanted to share his language with children.\u201d\nFrequently, Dahl invents insults and expletives to give power to the powerless characters in his stories, he says. \u201cWhen you write stuff, and a teacher corrects it and hands it back to you, you don\u2019t necessarily know that language belongs to you, that you can own it. But if you play with words and language or you know that you are entitled to, that is one way to own literacy \u2013 and that\u2019s what Dahl wanted. He was desperate for children to read and have fun when they were reading.\u201d\n This article was amended on 28 February 2019.

Sadly, despite some progress, rather than improve, they have fallen further behind. The lack of hard numbers is particularly worrying.\n\u201cFacebook has again failed to provide all necessary information, including any data on its actions in January on scrutiny of ad placements or efforts to disrupt advertising and monetisation incentives for those behind disinformation.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s executive arm, which is threatening to bring in regulation on disinformation unless the social media companies fall into line, added that it welcomed Facebook\u2019s recent decision to \u201cshare more information about political advertising on its platform with so-called \u2018good faith\u2019 researchers and organisations working on increasing transparency for the public\u201d.\nBut \u201cthey still need to live up to the standards we are asking of them \u2013 and that they signed up to\u201d, the commissioners warned. \u201cIt is vital that the platforms treat EU member states equally, and ensure that any relevant tools are available across the Union.\u201d\nIt noted that Facebook had fact-checking partners \u201cin only eight member states covering seven languages\u201d.\nThere are deep concerns that elections to the European parliament in May could be the target of manipulation in a similar manner to the US presidential election and the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum.\nThe commissioners did not hold back against the other two companies. \u201cTwitter, too, did not report on any additional efforts in January to improve ad placement, or information on the implementation of its Ads Transparency Centre in the EU,\u201d they said.\n\u201cGoogle has fared slightly better, reporting on scrutiny of ad placement, its new policy for election ads, and its dedicated teams to prevent election-related abuse of its services; but other information, like data on enforcement of its policies, is still lacking.\u201d",

He remains Sarri\u2019s first choice but, with Tottenham unable to muster a shot on target to unsettle his replacement, Willy Caballero, Arrizabalaga may have to wait for a return to the first team.\nThe youngster had learned of Sarri\u2019s decision in the pre-match tactical team meeting on the day of the game. \u201cIt was the right decision: Kepa made a big mistake and paid with the club, so then he had to pay with the team,\u201d said Sarri, whose side play Dynamo Kyiv at Stamford Bridge in the Europa League next week. \u201cBut now I think we have to stop.\n\u201cKepa, from tomorrow, will be with us.

The most important thing is that you need to understand very well, after every mistake. So now, for me, the issue is closed.\u201d Asked whether the \u00a371.6m signing from Athletic Bilbao remained his No 1, Sarri said: \u201cOf course.\u201d\nChelsea\u2019s victory maintained their pursuit of the top four, with Spurs\u2019 advantage over fourth-placed Arsenal \u2013 whom they play on Saturday \u2013 trimmed to four points.

I trust Ita and that\u2019s why I have asked her to take on this role.\u201d\nThe prime minister said the government would now recommend Buttrose\u2019s appointment to the governor general.\nButtrose said: \u201cThe ABC is one of the most important cultural and information organisations in Australia and I am honoured to be given the opportunity to lead it.\u201d\nThe acting ABC managing director, David Anderson, said the veteran journalist would provide valuable strategic leadership at an important time for the national public broadcaster.\n\u201cI join with all ABC employees in welcoming Ita Buttrose to this important role,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cMs Buttrose is an eminent Australian with vast experience as an editor and media executive. Her leadership of the ABC, a highly valued and trusted cultural institution, is welcomed.\n\u201cIn an era of globalised commercial media, a strong independent ABC is vital. We remain committed to outstanding news and current affairs, hosting conversations that inform the public, and delivering compelling content that is distinctive, high-quality and Australian.\u201d\nThe broadcaster\u2019s deputy chair, Kirstin Ferguson, said Buttrose was one of the greats of Australian media: \u201cShe will bring valuable experience to the ABC board at a time when we will need to make significant strategic and leadership decisions, including the appointment of the new managing director, in coming months.\u201d\nOn Monday Morrison said he had been disappointed there were no women on the shortlist, and praised Buttrose as a journalist.\n\u201cI have [known] Ita for a long time and I think she\u2019s an extraordinary Australian,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cAn Australian of the year. There have been few people more than Ita that I think have lifted the standards of journalism in this country and I think that says a lot about her character and her abilities.\u201d\nThere were several leaks to newspapers in the lead-up the announcement.\nWith the new chair in place the ABC board will be able to appoint a new managing director, ending a long period of instability since Michelle Guthrie was sacked in September. Ferguson, who was acting chair, did not apply for the top job, though Anderson is a frontrunner to replace Guthrie.\nButtrose is a veteran of the Australian media scene who in recent years has become a television personality and royal correspondent on Ten\u2019s Studio 10 and Nine Extra.\nShe made her name working for the late media mogul Kerry Packer as a groundbreaking editor of Cleo and the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly in the 1970s, and had a stint as editor of News Corp\u2019s Daily Telegraph.\nA biopic of her life, Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, in which Asher Keddie played a 30-year-old Buttrose, was a hit for the ABC in 2011.\nNot all reactions to Buttrose\u2019s appointment were positive, because she was not on the shortlist of candidates selected by the independent panel charged with finding the best person for the job.\n\u201cWe object to the appointment of Ita Buttrose as chair of the ABC under these circumstances,\u201d said Quentin Dempster, who represents the ABC Alumni group of former employees. \u201cNothing against Ita, but she was not an applicant for the job.\u201d\nThe secretary of the ABC section of the Community and Public Sector Union, Sinddy Ealy, said Buttrose\u2019s media experience was welcome and it was long overdue that the ABC board was led by a woman. \u201cHowever, ABC staff are finding it hard to believe that prime minister Scott Morrison and his government have made yet another direct appointment to the ABC board,\u201d Ealy said.\n\u201cThe Coalition is continuing to treat the ABC like a political plaything rather than following an arm\u2019s-length process that ensures appointments are made in the national interest.\n\u201cNot only has Mr Morrison disregarded the recommendations of the panel that the government themselves appointed to find a new chair, but he has done an enormous disservice to Ms Buttrose herself by tainting her appointment with the whiff of political interference before it has even begun.\u201d\nLabor\u2019s communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, welcomed Buttrose\u2019s appointment but said the recruitment process was tainted by political interference.\n\u201cMorrison ignored the merit-based recommendations of the nomination panel and reduced the selection process to a week-long media circus of leaks,\u201d Rowland said.\nGuthrie, the ABC\u2019s first female managing director, was sacked halfway through her five-year term, a move she said had left her \u201cdevastated\u201d. She is suing the national broadcaster for wrongful dismissal. She received a payout of more than $800,000 after her contract was terminated.\nAn advertisement for the new ABC managing director specified he or she should have a content background, experience running a large complex organisation and an understanding of the unique culture of the ABC.\nGuthrie\u2019s sacking was followed by a stream of sensational allegations leaked to the media about the former chair allegedly calling on Guthrie to fire the ABC\u2019s chief economics correspondent, Emma Alberici, and the political editor, Andrew Probyn.\n\u201cThey [the government] hate her,\u201d Milne wrote in a leaked email in reference to Alberici. \u201cGet rid of her.\u201d",

Supporters of the recount hope it will see the candidate currently in the third spot \u2013 MLC Dawn Walker \u2013 elevated into the more likely winnable second position.\nFlood condemned the legal action but said Greens NSW would defend it in court.\n\u201cThese individuals have had ample opportunities, over several months, to put the case for a recount,\u201d she said, adding they had declined to take a proposal to last weekend\u2019s state delegates council, and also could have taken legal action at any time since last year.\n\u201cInstead, they have waited until the stroke of midnight, with nominations to the electoral commission already open and due in a matter of days.\n\u201cSo we can only conclude that this is simply an attempt to wreck the party\u2019s campaign \u2026 The time, money and energy spent on this matter would have been better devoted to throwing out this dreadful government.\u201d\nHarris said members had been taking action inside the party since December 2018 and that the matter could be resolved by the court before the ticket was due on 6 March.\n\u201cThe group of people who run Greens NSW, who belong to a single faction, are the ones who make all these decisions, and we\u2019ve failed to persuade them to be reasonable,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe matter is before the court [Thursday], we\u2019ll be seeking a hearing either Friday or Monday. It will be half-day matter. That will give the Greens plenty of time to lodge an upper house ticket, and any suggestion we are derailing the process is false.\u201d\nCalls for a recount were first made public last year after former Greens MLC Jeremy Buckingham was ousted from the ticket, which had already been decided by a members\u2019 ballot. Buckingham was formally asked to step aside in December, following accusations of sexual misconduct from a former Greens staffer, which he denied.\nHis allies in the party \u2013 including MLCs Cate Faehrmann, Justin Field and Walker herself \u2013 have repeatedly called for a recount.\nThe preselection was decided by a members\u2019 vote in 2018, with incumbent MLC David Shoebridge, from the party\u2019s left, receiving the most first preference votes (1,161), followed by Buckingham (780). Due to the party\u2019s affirmative action rules, two men cannot occupy the first and second spots, so Abigail Boyd was placed second on the ballot after the distribution of preferences, Buckingham was placed third and Walker fourth.\nHarris said grassroots democracy was one of the four pillars of the Greens, and that principle was at stake in this dispute.\n\u201cWhat we have here is a situation where in a preselection ballot, which is the ultimate expression of grassroots democracy, 780 members, representing 30% of the vote, have been completely disenfranchised,\u201d he said.\nA party spokesman confirmed they were served papers on Wednesday evening.\nBuckingham is contesting the state election, to be held on 23 March, as an independent candidate.",

        "content": "In dramatic testimony, Cohen claims Trump committed crimes to cover up affair and had prior knowledge of WikiLeaks release\nDonald Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen accused the president in explosive public testimony before Congress of knowing in advance about key events under investigation in the Russia inquiry and of committing criminal conspiracy in the covering up of an extramarital affair.\nIn a day of high drama before the House oversight committee, Cohen delivered a string of bombshells that could spawn fresh investigations by Congress and the FBI. Testifying on Wednesday, he labelled the US president a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cconman\u201d, produced signed checks that he said were proof of a fraudulently disguised conspiracy to silence a former adult film actor, and gave what he claimed were eyewitness accounts that implied Trump had prior knowledge of crucial Russia links.\nCohen became the first in the president\u2019s inner circle to allege that Trump knew that his longtime adviser, Roger Stone, was communicating with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election regarding the release of hacked Democratic party emails.\nHe also said Trump was aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting between members of his presidential campaign, including his son Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, which was arranged in order to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\nCohen\u2019s testimony marked a rare opportunity for millions of Americans to bear witness to the account of a central player in multiple investigations ensnaring the president and associates. Cohen acted for more than a decade as the president\u2019s fixer \u2013 a role in which he became intimately familiar with both Trump\u2019s personal and professional affairs.\nIn an extraordinary and emotional closing statement, Cohen spoke directly to his former boss, admonishing Trump for a litany of sins ranging from his attacks against the media to his policy of separating immigrant families and his failure to \u201ctake responsibility for your own dirty deeds\u201d. He exhorted those who still support the president, as he once did, not to make \u201cthe same mistakes I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying\u201d.\nIn his most lurid warning, Cohen suggested that America could be facing existential peril as a constitutional democracy. \u201cGiven my experience working for Mr Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\nCohen\u2019s testimony, stretching, with breaks, over more than seven hours, highlighted how the US president faces legal and political peril on at least two fronts \u2013 the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, as well as a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws through the payment of hush money.\n\u201cToday, I am here to tell the truth about Mr Trump,\u201d Cohen said in his opening statement.\n\u201cI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,\u201d he added. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\u201d\nMichael Cohen was a lawyer for Donald Trump from 2006 until 2018. He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump\u2019s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.\nIn August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nCohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump\u2019s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.\nHaving previously described himself as \u201cthe guy who would take a bullet for the president\u201d, when sentenced, Cohen said \u201cI have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.\u201d\nThe 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans. He is expected to report to jail in May 2019.\nMartin Belam\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in November to crimes that including lying to Congress and is scheduled to go to prison in May to begin a three-year sentence. Speaking in a measured tone, Cohen described his testimony as a step on the \u201cpath of redemption\u201d and apologized to the panel for his previous lies.\nTrump, who arrived in Hanoi this week for a summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, accused Cohen of \u201clying in order to reduce his prison time\u201d.\nCohen testified publicly for the first time in detail about a six-figure sum that was paid to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen presented checks he said were signed by the president and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, to reimburse him for the hush money payments totaling $130,000.\n\u201cThe president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,\u201d Cohen said.\nRo Khanna, a congressman from California, suggested that the check for $35,000 signed by Trump amounted to the \u201csmoking gun\u201d in legal investigations bearing down on the president. He said it gave \u201ccompelling evidence of crimes \u2026 It\u2019s important for the American public to understand that this is financial fraud, garden variety financial fraud.\u201d\nKhanna put it to Cohen that he was saying that the US president had directed payments by his son and the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, \u201cas part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud\u201d. Khanna asked: \u201cIs that your testimony today?\u201d\nCohen hesitated for a moment, then replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\nHe told the panel that Trump knew of and approved each step of the payments, and said the president had committed other illegal acts that he was unable to discuss because they were under investigation.\nCohen added that he was instructed by Trump to lie about the alleged affair to the president\u2019s wife, Melania Trump, stating: \u201cLying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets because she is a kind, good person.\u201d\nThe finding that Donald Jr was directly involved in the scheme to pay off Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, could mean the president\u2019s son faces legal jeopardy. Federal prosecutors in New York, who have had copies of the checks and other records for months, say the payments violated campaign finance laws.\nThat investigation, which is being overseen by the southern district of New York, is also examining a six-figure payment made to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also alleged an affair with Trump, by the National Enquirer. The tabloid, which is owned by the president\u2019s close friend David Pecker, purchased the exclusive rights to McDougal\u2019s story and then refused to publish it in a practice known as \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d.\nCohen said he presided over \u201cseveral\u201d similar arrangements, while telling the committee: \u201cThese catch-and-kill scenarios existed between David Pecker and Mr Trump long before I started working for him in 2007.\u201d\nForensic questioning by the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared to lay the groundwork for subpoenas to be issued for the president\u2019s tax returns. She asked Cohen whether his knowledge of Trump\u2019s financial affairs led him to believe that the returns would be helpful to the committee in understanding how he managed sharply to reduce his tax burden by undervaluing his parents\u2019 real estate holdings, and he said that it would.\nElsewhere in the proceedings, Cohen said that he had seen Trump\u2019s tax returns but had not studied them. Trump had resisted releasing the documents, he suggested, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want an entire group of thinktanks, who are tax experts, to run through his returns\u201d.\nThe hearing began in dramatic fashion, with Republicans objecting to the leaking to the media of Cohen\u2019s testimony late on Tuesday evening, and pushing to postpone the event. They were overruled by Democrats, who since assuming a majority in the House in January have vowed to act as a check on Trump.\n\u201cWe are in search of the truth,\u201d Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said.\nBut his exchanges with Republican lawmakers often grew contentious, as allies of the president aggressively sought to undermine Cohen\u2019s credibility as a witness.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a pathological liar. You don\u2019t know truth from falsehood,\u201d Representative Paul Gosar, of Arizona, told Cohen.\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry, are you referring to me or the president?\u201d Cohen retorted.\nResponding to his testimony, Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign condemned Cohen as \u201ca felon, a disbarred lawyer, and a convicted perjurer\u201d.\n\u201cThis is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously,\u201d the Trump campaign spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, said in a statement. \nCohen was convicted in December of crimes that included lying to Congress over negotiations around a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. Cohen testified on Wednesday that he briefed the president\u2019s son, Donald Jr, and the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, about the deal approximately 10 times.\nDonald Trump Jr hit back at Cohen on Twitter, suggesting this was all an attempt by the president\u2019s former attorney to gain publicity.\nIn his testimony about the Trump Tower meeting, Cohen also said that he recalled Trump Jr telling his father \u201cin a low voice\u201d in early June 2016: \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d\n\n \u201cI remember Mr Trump saying, \u2018OK, good \u2026 let me know,\u201d Cohen said. He added that Trump had previously complained that Donald Jr \u201chad the worst judgment of anyone in the world\u201d and would not have set up a meeting of such significance without clearing it with his father.\nRobert Mueller, the special counsel, is concluding a two-year investigation into any links or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. Cohen said he had spoken with the special counsel\u2019s office on seven occasions.\nTrump told Mueller in a series of written answers last year that he did not discuss WikiLeaks with Stone and did not know of the Trump Tower meeting in advance.\nStone previously claimed to have been in touch with Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, but now says that he was lying about this. Stonesaid: \u201cMr Cohen\u2019s statement is untrue.\u201d\nCohen\u2019s remarks painted a scathing picture of a mobster-like president, who dispatched his former attorney to shortchange suppliers, threaten his schools that they must not release his student grades, and handle negative press around Trump\u2019s avoidance of the Vietnam war draft.\nIn one particularly revealing exchange, Cohen said he had probably threatened individuals on Trump\u2019s behalf at least 500 times under his former boss\u2019s instructions.\nCohen said he planned to produce false financial statements Trump provided to Deutsche Bank in pursuit of loans. Citing a Guardian article to illustrate his argument, Cohen said Trump inflated his wealth to secure a place on rich lists and artificially reduced it to avoid paying tax.\nCohen went on to note that Trump said black people were \u201ctoo stupid\u201d to vote for him and remarked during a drive through a poor area of Chicago that \u201conly black people could live that way\u201d.\n\u201cThe country has seen Mr Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries shitholes,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIn private, he is even worse.\u201d\n\ufeff",

        "content": "The first woman to play under the rule says her historic appearance for Carlton is part of the evolution of the league\nThe father-son rule has been a staple of the AFL for generations, helping to secure sons \u2013 and sometimes grandsons \u2013 for generational loyalty. As the AFLW continues its steady growth, it is a natural progression that the daughters of former players are now expanding this family tradition.\nWhen 18-year-old Abbie McKay ran out onto GMHBA Stadium last weekend, she made history as being one half of AFLW\u2019s first father-daughter team. Her father, Andrew, was part of the Blues\u2019 dream squad of the 1990s, winning a premiership in 1995 and only just recently stepping down as the club\u2019s head of football.\nAlthough her first game didn\u2019t result in the win she and the Blues had hoped for, it has given the lifelong Carlton supporter-turned-player her first taste for the big-time game she grew up watching. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting and I had a lot of fun,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an honour to run out there in the navy blue.\u201d\nMcKay has joined the midfield to add some grunt to Carlton\u2019s line-up, which is still finding its feet after the squad was rebuilt following a disappointing 2018 season. She plays in the same No 5 jersey her father wore for 244 games with Carlton, including the club\u2019s last premiership, \u201csomething that we can share in common\u201d, she says.\nIn something of a role reversal on Saturday, the senior McKay watched on from the stands, although he played down the historical significance of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s more [about] feeling pride in how well Abbie has done over a short period of time rather than any history-making,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a nice moment.\u201d\nThe father-son tradition has been one of the defining traditions in the AFL since the 1950s, providing a connection with history and family that can otherwise be missing in today\u2019s corporate game. Some of the best-known duos have played for the same club, sometimes even sharing the same number, include Ken and Dustin Fletcher (Essendon), Gary Ablett junior and senior (Geelong) and three generations of the Silvagni family at Carlton: Sergio, Stephen, Jack and Ben.\nThe first father-son pairing also came from Carlton, back in 1951, when Harvey Dunn Jr joined his father\u2019s club and cemented a foundation for a beloved tradition. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool and it\u2019s obviously just another stepping stone in the evolution of the AFL,\u201d McKay says. \u201cIt\u2019s cool that we have the first father-son and the first father-daughter team.\u201d\nDespite having a footballer for a father, MaKay\u2019s arrival into the game came just four years ago. She played netball and basketball for years but it was her mother who influenced her decision to play, after she established a local club in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran in 2015.\n\u201cI did a little bit of Auskick was I was younger with my brother but I didn\u2019t really play it much after that,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter my mum set up the club, I joined up with some of my friends and just went into it to have some fun. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d\nWhat began simply as a way of spending time with friends quickly morphed into something bigger with the discovery of McKay\u2019s hidden talent. She rapidly rose through the ranks and made her VFLW debut last year, in round 16, also for Carlton. Adding to her list of achievements are an appearance in the Under-18 national championships and a spot in the 2018 AFLW draft camp.\nMcKay senior, who played in the backline, says his daughter will be a more versatile player than he was, and although he does offer the occasional playing tips, both prefer to keep football out of their relationship.\nMcKay junior was among five players whose fathers previously played in the AFL, and who were considered for the 2019 draft pick. And while she\u2019s the only one to have taken to the field so far, with the AFLW growing at lighting pace she is unlikely to carry that mantle on her own for long.\n\u201cNext year and the year after, there are going to be so many girls whose dads played who will be drafted into the AFLW and it\u2019s going to be great for those families \u2013 and the game.\u201d",

As of this publication date, the film is still available for purchase or streaming on these three sites.\nDental health experts praised the decision to remove the film from Netflix, which has about 58 million subscribers in the US alone.\n\u201cThe film contains significant misinformation that is not supported by scientific evidence, which can cause unwarranted fear among viewers,\u201d said Jeffrey M Cole, the president of the ADA. Jennifer Gibbs, the director of endodontics at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, praised Netflix\u2019s \u201cwise and responsible decision\u201d, citing its large audience.\nThe company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but Eleanor Patterson, an assistant professor of media studies at Auburn University, said it was unlikely that criticism from the medical community played a large role.\nInstead, Netflix may be protecting its growing reputation for producing high-quality documentaries, Patterson said. Documentaries including Making a Murderer, which won four Emmys in 2016, and The White Helmets, Icarus, and Period. End of Sentence which have won Oscars.\nWith all those prizes come prestige, said Porter Bibb, a media expert and managing partner at MediaTech Capital Partners LLC. And a universally panned documentary film like Root Cause could do a lot of damage to Netflix\u2019s reputation \u2013 not just among viewers but among the high caliber talent that has been slowly migrating over to its production company.\n\u201cNetflix could not afford to take a back step and see the accolades and new prominence its films have achieved [disappear], or risk losing the high quality talent which has gravitated to Netflix in the past year,\u201d he said.\nMedia experts also pointed out that Netflix\u2019s lack of statement or explanation about the decision was in line with their secrecy about viewing ratings.\n\u201cUnlike broadcast, cable, box office, or retail sales, digital media platforms like Netflix can make these decisions in secret,\u201d said Miranda Banks, an associate professor of film and media at Emerson College. \u201cThat leaves the ADA, the filmmakers, and audiences left guessing their motive. But the motive is almost always money.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 28 February 2019. Due to an editing error, an earlier version said Making a Murderer had won an Oscar rather than Emmys.",

The trash is burned as feedstock at high temperatures to create fuel, gas or steam that drives a turbine and churns out electricity.\nIn this region, China has seen an explosion of waste-to-energy plants since 2002, sparking dozens of protests from residents concerned about impacts on their health and the environment.\nOn the face of it, burning waste looks like a solution to Australia\u2019s growing recycling crisis. The industry is reeling from China\u2019s 2018 decision to limit recycling imports. Last week two recycling facilities in Victoria were ordered to stop accepting waste because of dangerous stockpiling.\nIt could also be seen as a way to address the nation\u2019s energy woes. Energy ministers have been grappling for years for ways to make electricity reliable, sustainable and affordable, an issue that is frequently linked to the 2016 South Australian blackout.\nIn the past four years, three large-scale waste-to-energy projects have been given the green light by Western Australia\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority and this month a Maryvale paper mill in the Latrobe Valley announced it would proceed with Victoria\u2019s first waste-to-energy project.\nWhile plans to build a large waste-to-energy incinerator were cancelled in western Sydney, New South Wales is home to the nation\u2019s largest waste-to-fuel plant at Wetherill Park in Sydney.\nThe Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia chief executive, Gayle Sloan, says the goal is to capture energy from materials left behind after recycling programs, with 31 smaller facilities already turning residual waste to energy nationwide.\n\u201cYou have to mine everything that you can recover out, before you even go into the burning,\u201d Sloan says.\nAcross the nation, state and territory EPAs, governed by waste laws, use a hierarchy system in which prevention, then recycling, sit above recovering energy, treating and disposing in landfill.\nHowever, campaign group the Zero Waste Oz coordinator, Jane Bremmer, says the introduction of waste-to-energy incinerators in Australia threatens recycling.\n\u201cWe appear to have this system where waste-to-energy incinerations are being allowed to remove material recovery facilities [recycling centres] from their planned projects,\u201d says Bremmer. \u201cThey are doing that because it assures their waste stream.\u201d\nIn October 2018, the WA EPA approved the removal of infrastructure to sort waste from already-approved plans for a $400m waste-to-energy plant in Rockingham, 40km south of Perth.\nThe facility, which at the same time changed its proposal to also incinerate sewage and increase its throughput, will receive residual municipal waste from participating council bin systems instead of sorting waste.\nSloan says she is not aware of any local council that is removing existing recycling facilities, and that every state requires them.\nBut Western Australian local government authority the Southern Metropolitan Regional Council has put out a tender to sell off part of its regional resource recovery centre to private contractors while also calling for waste-to-energy services.\nThe SMRC chief executive, Tim You\u00e9, says the council is not moving away from recycling in favour of waste-to-energy facilities.\nThe federal environment minister, Melissa Price, did not specifically comment on the claims that waste-to-energy plants were undermining recycling, but pointed to the waste hierarchy system.\n\u201cThe government \u2026 is exploring opportunities in waste-to-energy as part of our broader suite of initiatives,\u201d she said. \u201cWaste-to-energy facilities can provide a value for waste that would otherwise go to landfill.\u201d\nThe federal government considers incinerating waste and organic matter for energy as renewable.\nThe classification is important because it creates revenue streams for industry, which can take advantage of grant programs, such as through the renewable energy agency Arena.\nBy mid 2018, Arena had invested $58m in 27 bioenergy and waste-to-energy projects.\nAustralia\u2019s first large-scale waste-to-energy plant received $23m from Arena and $90m from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.\nYet Greens Western Australian MP and the party\u2019s waste spokesman, Robin Chapple, says it is inappropriate for grants or loans meant for green energy to go to waste-to-energy programs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s consuming, in a large degree, a petroleum product into an energy stream which produces CO2 equivalent,\u201d Chapple says.\n\u201cWe managed to control the emissions, like dioxins, but we are still turning the plastics into a greenhouse gas. If you have a good recycling program which deals well with waste, the feedstock for incineration disappears.\u201d\nArena says the projects it has invested in capture energy from sewage, meat processing leftovers, landfill and organic litter, helping to reduce greenhouse gases from landfill and improve air quality.\nPlans produced in 2007 by the federal government concluded that by 2020, the bioenergy industry could quadruple its energy generation to 4% to curb the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut Chapple says an increase in waste-to-energy production spells an increase in CO2 and persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins.\nIn its 2007 report, the government acknowledged that \u201csignificant amounts\u201d of particulates, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides could pose health concerns and have implications for local air quality near the plant.\nAt the University of New South Wales, inventors from the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT) are taking recycling a step further, turning tyres into steel and discarded phones into gold.\nThe project head, UNSW engineering professor Veena Sahajwalla, says by resorting to burning waste for energy, Australia is not trying hard enough to repurpose materials.\n\u201cIt is not a good idea to burn materials for the purpose of generating energy,\u201d Sahajwalla says.\nSahajwalla has patented a microfactory that can be used at waste sites or in developing nations to transform discarded materials into molecules that can be reworked into new things.\n\u201cIf you are using something and then, after a single life, saying, \u2018I\u2019m done with it and I\u2019m going to burn away the fundamental molecules and elements and everything else to release a bit of energy\u2019, then that\u2019s not good,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIf we are burning it away, then we are not trying hard enough to see what are the different ways to repurpose by processing things in different ways and transforming them.\u201d",

Instead, they requested she pursue a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d, which allowed the company to pay a fine.\nWilson-Raybould said she was \u201cbarraged\u201d and subjected to \u201chounding\u201d by members of the government. According to contemporaneous notes taken after each interaction, Wilson-Raybould recalled 10 phone calls and 10 meetings regarding the case.\nWilson-Raybould also detailed a meeting with Trudeau, in which the prime minister said that \u2013 as a member of parliament from Quebec \u2013 he was concerned by the issue of SNC Lavalin jobs in the province, and asked her to \u201chelp out\u201d with the case.\n\u201cAre you politically interfering with my role as attorney general? I would strongly advise against it,\u201d Wilson-Raybould recalled telling the prime minister.\n\u201cNo, no, no, we just need to find a solution,\u201d she said, recalling the prime minister\u2019s answer.\nOn Wednesday night, Trudeau said it had been a \u201cdifficult few weeks\u201d because of internal disagreements in his party, but rejected opposition calls to resign. He said he completely disagreed with Wilson-Raybould, saying that the decision to avoid prosecuting SNC-Lavalin was hers and hers alone.\nWilson-Raybould also described a conversation with the government\u2019s top civil servant, Michael Wernick, who advised her the prime minister wanted to \u201cfind a way to get it done, one way or another.\nShe characterized the discussions as \u201ctreading on dangerous ground\u201d. Last week, Wernick told the same committee that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould.\nTrudeau\u2019s government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on 7 February that Trudeau or his staff pressured her to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya.\nWilson-Raybould refused to abandon the prosecution, and four months later, she was abruptly demoted to the position of veteran affairs minister \u2013 a move which she saw as a direct consequence.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think this ha[d] something to do with a decision I would not take,\u201d she told the committee.\nFollowing her demotion, she had \u201cthoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d Wilson-Raybould testified, in a reference to Richard Nixon\u2019s purge of US justice department officials during the Watergate scandal.\nUnder growing pressure, Trudeau denied that his office had \u201cdirected\u201d Wilson-Raybould, and said her presence in his cabinet was proof of their amicable relationship. She resigned hours later and retained the former supreme court justice Thomas Cromwell as her counsel.\nOpinion polls show the allegations are starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election against the official opposition Conservative party in October.\nOpposition lawmakers accuse Trudeau of trying to cover up an attempt by officials to help SNC-Lavalin, which could be banned from bidding for federal contracts for a decade if found guilty.\n\u201cJustin Trudeau can no longer hide the fact that he was at the center of an attempt to interfere in a criminal prosecution. He must come clean with Canadians,\u201d Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday before the testimony.\nScheer called on Trudeau to stand down and demanded a police inquiry.\n\u201cHe can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,\u201d he said.\nThe scandal has already cost Trudeau his closest adviser: Gerald Butts resigned earlier this month, but denied he had or others had improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould.\n\u201cWhat I hear today should make Canadians upset,\u201d Murray Rankin, a member of the New Democratic party, told Wilson-Raybould during the committee hearing.\nWilson-Raybould was granted a partial waiver of solicitor-client privilege in order to testify on Wednesday, but remains unable to speak about the content of her communications with Trudeau.\nWilson-Raybould, a Kwakwaka\u2019wakw lawyer from British Columbia, was Canada\u2019s first indigenous attorney general, and her inclusion in the cabinet was initially seen as proof of Trudeau\u2019s attempt to reset its relationship with indigenous peoples.\n\u201cI was taught to always hold true to your core values, principles and to act with integrity,\u201d said Wilson-Raybould at the conclusion of her statement. \u201cI come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth-teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our big house. This is who I am and who I always will be.\u201d",

Accepting the offer to be appointed the ABC chair shows she has no intention of slowing down.\nThe former Australian of the year founded the groundbreaking women\u2019s magazine Cleo, edited the most popular magazine in the country in the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, and became the first woman to edit a major Australian metropolitan newspaper when she was appointed editor-in-chief of News Corp\u2019s Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph in the 1980s.\nShe introduced male centrefolds at Cleo in the 1970s, alongside frank advice about sex for young women. For a time the Weekly under her editorship became the highest selling magazine in the the world per capita.\nIn recent years she has appeared on morning television \u2013 clashing backstage with a co-host, Denise Drysdale, over a bowl of brussels sprouts \u2013 and as a royal weddings correspondent. Her surprise appointment as ABC chair breaks a 37-year drought since another woman had the top job; Dame Leonie Kramer became its first female chair in 1982.\nWhile Buttrose edited the Weekly she appeared regularly in primetime TV commercials, telling readers with her trademark lisp what they could expect in the nation\u2019s most popular magazine. She always appeared impeccably groomed and effortlessly glamorous.\nCold Chisel wrote a hit song about her in 1980, based on those mesmerising TV ads. \u201cIta\u2019s tongue never touches her lips,\u201d Jimmy Barnes sang.\nEvery week, in every home\n  She got wholesome news for the family.\n  I believe, I believe, in what she says\n  Yes I do.\n  I believe, I believe, at the end of the day\n  Her magazine\u2019ll get me through.\nIn later years Buttrose published an eponymous magazine for women over 50, and another one devoted to pets. She became an advocate for older Australians who have Alzheimer\u2019s and was named Australian of the year in 2013.\nThe media executive Anita Jacoby, who worked with Buttrose in the 1980s when she was at the Weekly, and again as an advocate for people with Alzheimer\u2019s, has only praise for her.\n\u201cIta Buttrose is all class,\u201d Jacoby told Guardian Australia. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely capable, intelligent and a great role model for all Australians. Her choice as the new ABC chair is inspired.\u201d\nButtrose\u2019s rise to the top at Australian Consolidated Press, where she had to manage Kerry Packer\u2019s infamously demanding personality, gave her a reputation as a tough operator. That period gave rise to the 2011 ABC miniseries Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, in which Asher Keddie played a 30-year-old Buttrose. The biopic rated through the roof, spawning a sequel, Magazine Wars, and inspiring Channel Nine\u2019s Howzat! Kerry Packer\u2019s War.\nButtrose succeeded at the highest levels of Australian media, and in the most blokey of cultures, at a time when women were largely shut out.\nBut the ABC role will open up a whole new battlefield for her. With public broadcasting supporters already objecting to her appointment \u2013 because she was not on the shortlist of recommendations given to the government \u2013 her journey may not be smooth.",

        "content": "He implied the president knew more about Russian links during the 2016 presidential race than he has admitted\nMichael Cohen told the committee he had been with Donald Trump when key events in the investigation into Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election were discussed. His testimony implied that the US president was far more deeply informed about Russian links during the 2016 presidential race than he has so far admitted.\nThe first incident, in early June 2016, involved Cohen overhearing Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr, whispering in the elder Trump\u2019s ear that \u201cthe meeting is all set\u201d. Cohen said he took that remark, and Trump\u2019s reply to it \u2013 \u201cOK good \u2026 let me know\u201d \u2013 to refer to the Trump Tower meeting that followed between Donald Jr and others in the inner Trump circle and a party of Russians peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton.\nThe US president has denied he had any prior knowledge of the meeting.\nEqually explosive was Cohen\u2019s claim, the first from any Trump associate, that the then presidential candidate knew in advance about the release of stolen Democratic emails by WikiLeaks. Cohen said he had been in Trump\u2019s office on 18 or 19 July 2016 when a phone call came in from Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s former campaign adviser.\nStone allegedly told Trump on speaker phone that he had just got off the line to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, who had revealed that a dump of emails damaging to Clinton was imminent. WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails, later found by US intelligence to have been hacked by Russian operatives, on 22 July.\nAsked by Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, whether Trump\u2019s subsequent denial that he had ever spoken to Stone about the WikiLeaks dump was true, Cohen replied: \u201cNo, it was not.\u201d\nCohen went into granular detail about a scheme that he said was cooked up by Trump, Donald Jr and the chief finance officer of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, to pay off Stormy Daniels, the adult film actor who has alleged she had an affair with the real estate tycoon. The scheme arranged for Cohen to be paid back the $130,000 he had paid from his own money to buy Daniels\u2019 silence just before the 2016 election, in installments, Cohen said, in order to disguise the purpose of the transactions.\nCohen produced for the committee a copy of one of the installments \u2013 a $35,000 check signed by Trump from his personal bank account on 1 August 2017, when he was already in the White House. Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California, said this was the \u201csmoking gun document\u201d that proved a conspiracy by Trump to commit criminal fraud by hiding the purpose of company spending.\nIn Cohen\u2019s account, Trump was aware of the scheme at every stage. \u201cOh, he knew about everything, yes,\u201d he said. The aim was \u201cto keep Trump as far away as possible\u201d from the Daniels payments.\nIn an exchange with Katie Hill, a Democrat from California, Cohen said he had received a call from Trump when the lawyer was in the course of an interview with Vanity Fair. His boss wanted to agree on the \u201cpublic messaging\u201d about the payments.\nCohen was instructed to say that Trump \u201cwas not knowledgable of these reimbursements and he was not knowledgable of my actions\u201d. That statement could place the president in severe legal jeopardy under campaign finance laws that prohibit the use of secret funds for political gain during an election.\nIn December, the publisher of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc (AMI), admitted to paying a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, $150,000 in hush money. In a so-called \u201ccatch and kill\u201d deal, she agreed to keep silent about her alleged sexual affair with Trump while AMI agreed to suppress the story so that it remained secret.\nCohen\u2019s testimony suggested that the practice of \u201ccatch and kill\u201d at AMI both long preceded his arrival as Trump\u2019s lawyer in 2007 \u2013 they went back at least 12 years he said \u2013 and went much wider than the McDougal affair. Under questioning by Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, he revealed that the media group frequently engaged in suppressing stories as a favor to Trump, a personal friend of AMI\u2019s CEO, David Pecker.\nAMI had tried to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d a story that was circulating that Trump had been caught on tape hitting his wife Melania in an elevator. The story, Cohen said, was not true, but the National Enquirer\u2019s owners had nonetheless checked it out with the intention of squashing it.\nThe company had also pursued \u201ccatch and kill\u201d with a story over a Trump love child. That rumor was also untrue, to Cohen\u2019s knowledge, but AMI had even so paid $15,000 to prevent it from becoming public.\nTrump could be in further legal hot water as a result of the Cohen testimony. During the course of questioning, members of the oversight committee learned that the much-feared prosecutors of the southern district of New York were pursuing fresh criminal investigations relating to the president.\nThe Illinois congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi asked Cohen whether he knew of any other \u201cwrongdoing or illegality\u201d by Trump. Cohen, declining to answer the question in detail, replied: \u201cYes, and those are part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being looked at by the southern district of New York\u201d.\nIt is not known what those investigations might entail, although Cohen did hint that one line of inquiry being pursued by the southern district might be possible criminal fraud committed in the course of the Stormy Daniels payments.\nFurther legal difficulties could arise over a 2013 sworn deposition in which Trump said he hardly knew Felix Sater, a real estate developer who had been involved in plans to build a Trump tower in Moscow. In the deposition, which carries the risk of perjury for anyone giving false testimony, Trump said he hardly knew Sater and that if they were in a room together he \u201creally wouldn\u2019t know what he looked like\u201d.\nYet Cohen told the committee that Sater not only had an office in Trump Tower in Manhattan, but that it was on the 26th floor \u2013 \u201cMr Trump\u2019s floor\u201d. Documents held by the Trump Organization would prove the close relationship between the two men, he said.\nAs a third area of potential legal peril, Cohen said that he had in his possession about 100 voice recordings of conversations with those in and around the Trump inner circle. Asked by Speier whether he would be willing to hand them all over, he quipped: \u201cIf you really would like them.\u201d\nIn one of the more memorable exchanges, Speier asked Cohen how many times Trump had asked him to threaten anyone on his behalf. \u201cQuite a few times,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cFifty times?\u201d Speier pressed. Cohen snapped back: \u201cMore.\u201d\n\u201cOne hundred times?\u201d\n\u201cMore.\u201d\n\u201cTwo hundred times?\u201d\n\u201cMore.\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred times?\u201d\n\u201cProbably. Over the 10 years.\u201d\nCohen clarified that he meant \u201cthreatening them with litigation or an argument with a nasty reporter that is writing an article\u201d.",

It argues this would lead to greater patronage and that the government business case for moving it was \u201cinadequate\u201d and did not consider the option of leaving it at the current site.\nThe chairman of the committee, Greens MP David Shoebridge, said the move would be a disaster.\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling for a major investment in the Powerhouse Museum. Parramatta should get its own iconic cultural institution that reflects its Aboriginal, colonial and migration history,\u201d he said.\nThe report says: \u201cParramatta deserves a world-class museum that all of Sydney, in fact all of NSW and Australia, can get behind and support. Tragically, through political manoeuvring and sheer bloody-mindedness, the current proposal fails to achieve this.\u201d\nShoebridge said: \u201cThis was always about a property deal pretending to be about cultural institutions.\u201d\nThe Berejiklian government has proposed to move the Powerhouse to Parramatta and is likely to sell large parts of the Ultimo site for redevelopment, with the exception of the original power station building, which it has said will become a museum of fashion.\nIt would move the Powerhouse collection to a new museum at Parramatta, to be partially funded by a 60-storey apartment development on the site near the Parramatta river.\nThe NSW government continued to push ahead with its plan on Thursday by announcing three more members of the design jury for the new precinct. The panel is chaired by the businesswoman and art entrepreneur Naomi Milgrom and will include American architect, Jeanne Gang, designer of Chicago\u2019s Aqua tower.\n\u201cThis poorly informed decision was made before a preliminary business case had even been prepared,\u201d Shoebridge said.\nThe government fought orders from the upper house to release the final business case, leading to a tussle over whether it constituted a cabinet document. In the end the government chose to release it.\nThe committee found that the final business case did not comply with the NSW Treasury\u2019s own guide to cost-benefit analysis. It did not consider the status quo option and it looked at patronage figures from a single month \u2013 July 2017.\nThe committee obtained a 2014 business case by Ernst and Young that looked at seven options and found that relocation of the museum would have adverse effects on international, national and local patronage, and \u201cwas not a viable project option\u201d.\nIt also warned of a public backlash because of the museum\u2019s important historical connection with the Ultimo and Pyrmont area.\nLabor has said it will keep the museum at Ultimo and invest $500m in a new cultural institution at Parramatta.\nThe report is also highly critical of the Powerhouse\u2019s controversial Fashion Ball, held in February 2018, a disastrous fundraiser that the report says cost $388,391 but raised just over $70,000. There were also reports of a wild after-party in the director\u2019s suite. The director of the museum, Dolla Merrillees, did not reapply for her position and left in mid 2018.\nThe committee said it heard from numerous witnesses that the Powerhouse had been neglected since the relocation was announced in 2015.\nIt found that both management and the board of trustees had \u201clost their way\u201d and the museum was not performing to the high standard it once did. It said the NSW government had used the museum\u2019s decline inappropriately to bolster its case.",

        "content": "Conservatives split over cardinal\u2019s crimes, as legal expert says questioning the verdict could deter victims from seeking justice\nThe broadcaster Ray Hadley has criticised former Liberal prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott for expressing sympathy with George Pell, warning that to doubt the verdict is to call the cardinal\u2019s victim a liar.\nThe conservative broadcaster told 2GB Radio on Thursday Howard had gone \u201cway over the top\u201d by providing a \u201cgushing reference\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my opinion Mr Abbott and Mr Howard have made gross errors of judgment,\u201d Hadley said, noting that paedophiles escaped punishment because they hid their crimes and \u201ccon their friends and colleagues\u201d.\n\u201cThis is not over, there is an appeal process. For someone as prominent as Mr Howard to basically say the victim\u2019s a liar and Pell\u2019s not, is not what it should be about.\u201d\nOn Thursday morning the head of a child sexual abuse legal service also condemned columnists who have expressed their disbelief in the verdict, warning it sends an \u201cincredibly damaging message to survivors\u201d.\nWarren Strange, the executive officer of Knowmore legal service, told a parliamentary inquiry he expected the \u201cunprecedented\u201d publicity around the Pell case to drive a spike in claims but media commentary doubting the verdict might deter victims from seeking justice.\nAfter Pell\u2019s conviction, revealed on Tuesday, of one count of sexual penetration and four counts of indecent assault against two 13-year-old choirboys, several commentators including News Corp\u2019s Miranda Devine and Andrew Bolt declared their belief in Pell\u2019s innocence.\nPell has also been defended by Howard, in a glowing character reference labelling him a \u201cperson of both high intelligence and exemplary character\u201d. Abbott has revealed he called Pell after the verdict and indirectly supported him by continuing to call the cardinal his friend.\nOn Thursday a parliamentary joint committee met in Canberra to hear evidence on the effectiveness of the victims\u2019 redress scheme set up after the institutional child sexual abuse royal commission.\nStrange told the hearing that Knowmore had already seen \u201ca number people contacting us across the last couple of days as the result\u201d of the Pell case, explaining they were \u201cnot just survivors who experience abuse in a Catholic institution, it can elevate survivors from any context\u201d.\n\u201cI expect there will be an impact. Certainly whenever there is that level of attention \u2013 and this [case] is perhaps unprecedented \u2013 whenever there has been significant media attention we tend to see a spike in calls,\u201d he said.\nSenator Derryn Hinch suggested that particular media articles doubting the verdict could deter victims, citing the fact that many do not come forward because they fear they will not be believed.\nStrange said that he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about those articles, accusing commentators of \u201cattempting to traverse the verdict of the jury who had the benefit of sitting in court and hearing all the evidence\u201d.\n\u201cAnd with due respect to those columnists, the defence team for the particular accused was better able to point to all the circumstances and to argue the case for an acquittal \u2013 and that didn\u2019t happen, the jury\u2019s verdict has come in,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTo then say I don\u2019t believe it, or it\u2019s wrong, I think that sends an incredibly damaging message to survivors who are thinking about coming forward.\n\u201cThey must be thinking, some of them will be thinking \u2018why would I do this, why would I put myself through a process like that then run the risk of public criticism\u2019 for an outcome we\u2019ve seen.\n\u201cI think it can potentially be very, very damaging to survivors to be writing those types of stories.\u201d\nHinch also took aim at defence barrister Robert Richter\u2019s submissions in relation to sentencing that Pell\u2019s offences were \u201cplain vanilla offending\u201d, labelling it \u201cabsolutely offensive\u201d.\nStrange suggested that measuring sexual assault by metrics such as the duration of the offence is \u201cdevastating for survivors\u201d.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t see things through the same lens, that [conduct is] not at the worst possible scale of offending \u2013 it\u2019s irrelevant to them.\u201d\nStrange told the hearing that one cause of the delay in claims is that some \u201cmajor institutions\u201d have yet to join.\nThe department of social services has started to publish a list of institutions that are yet to join the redress scheme. Currently there are more than 100 organisations which were named in the royal commission that are yet to join.\nThe social services minister Paul Fletcher said the decision to name the institutions will provide transparency for abuse survivors considering applying for redress payments, but the government also expects those not named in the royal commission to join.\nDepartmental officials told the hearing the majority of institutions had now responded giving a timeframe to join the scheme but some had not received the initiative to name and shame them well.\nIt was last week revealed 51 Australians have received payments through the scheme, receiving on average $79,035. Officials blamed delays on many institutions only joining the scheme in December.",

This is also about sending a clear message that the game doesn\u2019t tolerate violence.\u201d\nHe stressed that by standing down a player \u2013 an outcome that will be determined against a benchmark of seriousness \u2013 there would be no assumption of guilt or innocence.\nThe new rules allow players facing charges which carry a jail term of 11 years or more to be stood down. The NRL chief executive also has the discretion to stand down players facing other serious charges, including violence against women and children.\nSt George Illawarra and New South Wales star De Belin has pleaded not guilty to a charge of aggravated sexual assault and on Thursday broke his silence to insist he was innocent and will \u201cvigorously defend\u201d the charge against him.\nUnder the new ruling he and other players in similar situations will be allowed to train with their clubs while stood down. They will receive full pay but not be able to play in NRL or representative games until the outcome of their court cases are known.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making no judgment whatsoever on any player,\u201d Beattie said. \u201cIssues of innocence and guilt are determined in court. We\u2019re establishing a benchmark to protect rugby league. This is about rebuilding the reputation of rugby league.\u201d\nThe case of Manly\u2019s Dylan Walker, who has pleaded not guilty to common assault following an alleged domestic violence incident, will be considered at a later date.\nThere will be no automatic salary cap relief for clubs affected by any player being stood down, but clubs can apply for help on a case-by-case basis.\nFollowing an off-season marred by a stream of unsavoury incidents, the issue of how to deal with players facing serious criminal charges has split the rugby league community.\nBeattie has been vocal about the need for change and claimed the changes had been supported by 15 of the NRL\u2019s 16 clubs chairs, while respected voices such as Australian coach Mal Meninga also feel that it would be the right thing for the game.\nBut the policy change has been strenuously opposed by the Rugby League Players Association which says it will prejudice the players\u2019 right to a fair trial. It opens the door for players to sue to the NRL and RLPA chief executive Ian Prendergast said on Thursday the union would back any members who exercised their legal rights.\nThe Dragons said they would consider the changes made by the game\u2019s decision makers but for the moment they were concerned for De Belin\u2019s welfare.\n\u201cI\u2019m very supportive of the desire of the NRL to improve player behaviour and propagate the game of rugby league,\u201d Dragons chief executive Brian Johnston said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with is a very polarising and complex subject regarding Jack de Belin.\n\u201cAbove all we\u2019re being guided by the legal system, the NRL rules and code of conduct. And above all we\u2019re very concerned about the welfare of Jack de Belin. That\u2019s our priority. We\u2019re about to head off now and give consideration to the changes the NRL are making to the rules so we can digest that.\u201d",

Gillian Triggs\u2019 report for the Australian Human Rights Commission on children in immigration detention had just been released and Cat Hope, a Perth-based composer, was beginning to despair that Australia\u2019s policy on children in detention would never change. She watched as the report seemed to slide into a black hole, and Triggs was personally attacked by the rightwing media and conservative government.\n\u201cI was pretty horrified how the report was received in parliament,\u201d Hope tells Guardian Australia. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just about how the report was received, it was also how Triggs herself was received. All the expertise that led to this point was just dismissed.\u201d\nHope saw that voicelessness characterised the issue: the voicelessness of people in asylum \u2013 \u201cstateless and in every sense of the word, unrepresented\u201d \u2013 but also the voicelessness of those who wanted to support asylum seekers but were either suffering from compassion fatigue or felt they were unable to be of practical assistance.\n\u201cI was struggling to see how I could help,\u201d she says. How could writing another letter to another politician make a difference when those same politicians were so dismissive of their own human rights experts?\n\u201cI thought this problem could be agitated in a different way, so I decided to make a large-scale work that would address this problem.\u201d\nThe result, Speechless, is playing now as part of the Perth festival. It is technically an opera; it uses \u201cthe structure and form of opera. We have an overture, we have duets, solo, an interlude,\u201d says Hope.\nThe difference is this opera has no words.\n\u201cOpera traditionally deals with tricky things in the human condition. I worked out how I could set the report to opera and took the words out and then communicated with just sound.\u201d\nHope took an experimental approach to adapting the report for opera. She took the children\u2019s drawings and photographs, created inside detention, that were included in the report and turned them into colours and codes. Then she fed the colours and codes through an iPad program that transmuted them into a score.\nThe resulting 70-minute work challenges the very form of opera, or traditional ideas of how opera should look and sound. Hope advises that audiences read the program before they see it, otherwise \u201cyou get less out of it\u201d.\nSpeechless features four female soloists: the opera singer Judith Dodsworth; the metal singer Karina Utomo from extreme metal band High Tension; the West Australian experimental vocalist Sage Pbbbt and the Iranian-\u00adborn singer Tara Tiba, who appeared in last year\u2019s successful Perth festival production of Siren Song.\nJoining them on stage is a 30-member community choir and a 30-\u00adpiece orchestra.\nThe work is dark and seems full of pain, in part due to the fact that Hope\u2019s orchestra uses low frequency instruments. \u201cDouble basses, large subwoofers, bass guitars and all the low frequency orchestral instruments, and the drums are all very low sounding,\u201d she says.\nThe choice of instruments is not accidental. Hope completed a PhD on low frequency sound. She is also an academic and the head of the Sir Zelman Cowan School of Music at Monash University. \u201cVery low frequency creates a physiological response. You feel the sound in your body. It\u2019s air moving. You listen to low frequency in your skin. It can create a sense of awe. They have big pipes in church organs for a reason. It makes you emote,\u201d she says.\nDespite the challenges, many of which are embodied in what may be a challenging work for both audiences and performers, Hope hasn\u2019t grown cynical or despondent about the refugee issue. She still believes that things can change. After some performances of Speechless there are post-show panels in which audiences have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss action people can take to help make change happen.\n\u201cI want this to agitate people and I wanted to bring the humanitarianism back into this issue. If people step up, things will change.\u201d\nSpeechless is showing as part of Perth Festival until 3 March",

        "content": "Rawan and Reem fled their family trying to reach Australia six months ago \u2013 now their only hope is an emergency visa from a third country\nRawan and Reem are watching the clock. At the end of the day on Thursday the sisters, who escaped from Saudi Arabia almost six months ago, could be deported home where they face prison, beatings, and possibly death.\nThe women, who are using aliases out of fear of retribution by members of their family, have been in legal limbo since landing in Hong Kong in September after an aborted attempt to reach Australia where they hoped to get asylum. Their \u201ctolerated overstay\u201d in the city as visitors ends on Thursday, according to their lawyer. They risk arrest, prosecution and possibly removal.\nTheir options are limited. They are hoping to be granted emergency visas to travel to a third country where they have a chance of being given asylum \u2013 Hong Kong resettles very few refugees. In the meantime, they have applied for an extension of their stay in Hong Kong.\nIf that is not granted they are not sure what will happen. The sisters, who have renounced Islam, fear the worst if returned to their family in Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cDeath. We fear from honour killings,\u201d said Rawan. The sisters, wearing T-shirts and torn jeans, with their hair and faces uncovered, are in a hotel room where they believe it is safer to meet.\nThe consequences are severe for Saudi women who attempt to run away. They can go to prison, be beaten and in some cases killed by their family members.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really bad stories, daily, every week,\u201d said Rawan. \u201cWe can\u2019t even count them,\u201d Reem added. She says such cases are kept quiet, barely covered up. \u201cThey will say she had a heart attack, even though she was only 20.\u201d\nYears of violence, verbal abuse, and being controlled in everything from what they wore to their tone of voice and who they would marry pushed the sisters to escape from their home last year.\n\u201cOur rooms were the prison cell and our fathers and brothers were the prison keepers. Saudi Arabia is one big prison,\u201d Reem said.\nOn 6 September, after two years of planning and squirrelling away money earned from memorising verses of the Qur\u2019an, Rawan and Reem fled while on a family holiday in Sri Lanka. They had visitor visas for Australia, a destination they chose because of its electronic visa application and because they believed it was committed to human rights.\nIn the middle of the night, they took their passports from their parents\u2019 room, took a taxi to the airport in Colombo and boarded the first leg of their journey to Melbourne, with a two-hour layover in Hong Kong.\nBy the time they arrived in Hong Kong about five hours later, Saudi officials were already waiting. According to the sisters, a Saudi consular official tried to pressure them into taking a flight to Dubai, first telling them they had an issue with their passports and then that their mother was ill.\nBut the sisters refused. They knew what had happened to Dina Ali Lasloom, a Saudi woman who in 2017 also attempted to get to Australia to seek asylum. She was caught in Manila and forced on to a plane to Riyadh, reportedly bound and gagged.\n\u201cThey thought we are idiots, \u201c said Rawan. \u201cThey think I am just teenager and I will believe him. They didn\u2019t know I\u2019ve been planning for two years. They didn\u2019t know I know what they did to Dina Ali... but I knew what I was doing.\u201d\nThe women grabbed their passports from the official and ran to the gate of their Cathay Pacific flight for Melbourne only to discover their tickets had been cancelled. They tried to book another flight, this time on Qantas, but a Saudi official appeared again, telling airline staff and an immigration official the girls\u2019 mother was ill and that they had stolen money.\nThwarted again, the sisters decided to enter Hong Kong and make a new plan. A few days later they received a notice that their Australian visas had been revoked. It has now been almost six months of hiding and waiting.\n\u201cI feel that all this time has been wasted, just like I wasted my life in Saudi Arabia. I feel like I haven\u2019t started my life yet, like it\u2019s zero. My entire age is zero,\u201d said Reem.\nThey were disappointed their visas to Australia were cancelled but not surprised. \u201cI take a tourist visa, but I am going to seek asylum \u2026 so I was disappointed but I understand that,\u201d said Rawan.\nThe Australian government has been approached for comment.\nThe case is the latest example of women attempting to escape from Saudi Arabia, emboldened by examples of others before them and aided by social media and online resources.\nIn January, Rahaf Mohammed, 18, barricaded herself in a hotel room in Bangkok to prevent being deported back to Saudi Arabia. She pleaded online for help and was eventually granted asylum in Canada. Rawan and Reem, hopeful that Mohammed\u2019s case will prove a positive precedent for theirs, have been posting on Twitter.\nAll what we asking for is to be safe, All what we asking for is to live at least one single day without fear, to sleep without nightmares, to have a home where we can live without being threat! We don\u2019t want to be killed. Please save us.\nActivists say hundreds of women try to escape the kingdom each year.\n\u201cWe have received an increasing number of accounts of Saudi women attempting to flee Saudi Arabia for various reasons, which include escaping systematic discrimination in Saudi Arabia under the male guardianship system as well as fleeing domestic violence or threats of violence,\u201d said Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch.\nCoogle said the organisation has worked with seven or eight similar cases. \u201cThe real number who attempt to escape is likely much higher,\u201d he said.\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters still do not feel free. They move from safe house to safe house and go outside only when accompanied by people they trust. In some ways it is similar to their old life in Saudi Arabia where they were stuck at home, watching movies and television shows about life elsewhere.\nOne thing that is different is the opportunity to express themselves. \u201cOne of the freedoms we have is that we can speak loudly,\u201d said Rawan. \u201cWe can speak freely about what we think, what we love, without fearing we could be punished by what we say,\u201d Rawan said. Sometimes it feels strange, she admits.\nWhat does not feel strange, Reem says, is no longer wearing an abaya (cloak). \u201cThe moment I took off the abaya, I didn\u2019t feel strange. I felt normal,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe first time I stepped into Hong Kong with my sister, I was amazed. I felt the air touch my face and hair and I breathed without the niqab. I walked without someone watching my steps and I talked to my sister without someone watching how loud my voice is,\u201d she said.",

They are drawn to the edgelands, those places that often smack of dereliction and abandonment, the adult-free margins that become briefly central to their lives.\nBeyond the pavements, the street lights and houses with disapproving windows, the railway bridge is a conduit to the countryside. Youthful voices shout in lurid colours along its dark brick walls, a golden daubed heart is badged with the slogan \u201cLive ya life!\u201d\nThere is light woodland on the other side of the bridge. Tree canopies lock branches in pretty arches over a road into the country, which curves ahead and sweeps out of sight. It once went by the innocent and knowing name of Lovers\u2019 Lane.\nTyres of cars for which it seems no road is ever wide enough have muddied the margins, grinding out milled edges. Narrower wheels with lighter treads have veered off to the side, running along broad paths into what the locals call the Sand Hills. Historically, builders from the town dug deep for sand, leaving a mass of hillocks and hollows that in time scrubbed over with trees and bushes. In the centre, a flat expanse of partly grassed sand the size of a cricket pitch hosts the town\u2019s annual firework display.\nOver the rise behind this public arena, the trees and bushes grow denser, the paths reduced in places to gloopy threads, the uneven ground and fallen branches thickly coated with moss, the sunken hollows now ponds full of silty water. Town teenagers have marked their presence within this dank hinterland in a scatter of drinks bottles and tin cans.\nThe wood runs out at the largest pond whose far side is fringed with reeds, a curtain to the farm fields beyond. On a fallen tree trunk at the water\u2019s edge someone has balanced a half-full beer can.\nI pour out the contents and fill my bag with a dozen or so more cans and bottles on my way back \u2013 clearing up after the kids. It is probably OK to be here early in the teen-free mornings. Later, I would be invading their space. Live ya life!",

        "content": "2018-19 season tops temperature highs across the country, exceeding previous record set six years ago \nAustralia has endured its hottest summer ever, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, breaking the previous record set six years ago.\nThe 2018-19 summer, which produced near 50C days and topped temperature highs across the country, has officially exceeded the previous record set in 2012-13, which was 1.28C above what is considered normal. Climate analysts say it falls into a pattern of human-induced global warming.\nJanuary alone had already been confirmed as the hottest month ever recorded in Australia, with a mean temperature across the nation of 30.8C, which was 2.9C above the average for January temperatures (calculated between 1961\u20131990) of 27.9C.\nOn Thursday, the BoM revealed the whole season was officially the hottest ever recorded.\nWhile exact figures are not yet confirmed, the bureau said this summer\u2019s mean temperature was at least 2C above the 27.5C benchmark of what is considered normal, based on 1961-1990.\n\u201cSummer has been our warmest summer on record in terms of maximum temperatures, in terms of minimum temperatures and in terms of mean temperatures,\u201d said Andrew Watkins, the BoM\u2019s manager of long-range forecasting.\nThe statistics will come as no surprise to Australians who sweltered through back-to-back heatwaves and battled bushfires across the country.\nIn January alone, Adelaide broke its all-time heat record with a 46.6C day, Port Augusta broke its record with 48.9C, and then broke it again with 49.5C a week later.\nThe small New South Wales town of Noona also broke the record for the highest overnight minimum ever recorded, with a night that never dropped below 39.5C. And in Cloncurry in Queensland, residents endured 43 days in a row over 40C, Watkins said.\nThis summer\u2019s extreme temperatures had been predicted since late last year, with the BoM\u2019s climate outlook forecasting a drier, hotter summer due to the El Ni\u00f1o weather event, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and the effect of global warming.\nThe \u201clong-term increasing trend in global air and ocean temperatures\u201d was a factor in the hotter-than-average summer, the report said in October.\nOn Thursday, the BoM also updated its outlook for the coming autumn, saying there were \u201cvery high odds\u201d that hot, dry conditions would continue.\nWatkins warned that while some high rainfall events could occur, it would largely be bad news for drought-stricken farmers. \u201cI wish we had better news than that,\u201d he said.\nAlso on Thursday, Victorian health authorities warned of a late summer heatwave that would bring 40C temperatures on Saturday.\nThe bureau has forecast a heatwave across most of Victoria over the weekend, and Victoria\u2019s chief health officer issued a health alert for parts of the state from Thursday to Saturday.\nPregnant women, the elderly, children and people with medical conditions have been warned to take care.\nVictoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, also warned there was a high fire risk, peaking at a severe fire danger rating in parts on Saturday.",

        "content": "Biologist Rob Dunn is the David Attenborough of the domestic sphere, uncovering everything from microbes in the shower to spiders in the basement. He goes on safari in the dusty corners of one Copenhagen home\nThe good news is that I will never be home alone again. The bad news \u2013 well, it\u2019s not in fact bad news, but it is slightly unsettling \u2013 is that I share my home with at least 5,000 other species: wasps, flies, spiders, silverfish and an exotic bunch of wild bacteria.\nAll that information is apparently contained in a patch of grey dust I have just swabbed with my right index finger from a door frame in my living room. It\u2019s like a DNA test of my house, says Rob Dunn, a 43-year-old American biologist who has come to my house in Copenhagen to hunt microbial life. He carries no lab gear and his blue crewneck jumper and striped Oxford shirt are hardly the combat suit of an exterminator. But with every discovery we make, with every spider we find lurking in the corner or each swab of dust, he displays an almost childlike sense of excitement. He swears and smiles, even whoops with delight: \u201cThis dust sample contains bacteria, your body microbes, your wife\u2019s body microbes, your child\u2019s body microbes. If you smoke weed we would find marijuana DNA in there. Everything is visible, but it\u2019s also present in every breath. Every time you inhale, you inhale that story of your home.\u201d\nDunn is to house insects and indoor bacteria what Marie Kondo is to neatly folded shirts. He wants us to study the wildlife in our homes and realise that what we discover should spark much more joy than fear. When he began working as a biologist he went to the jungle to study wild beasts, but now his research is dedicated to species much closer to home: to the flies, spiders and bacteria hidden in every nook and cranny of our kitchens, bathrooms and basements. To the \u201cjungle of everyday life\u201d, as he describes it in his new book.\nNever Home Alone tracks how we have been disconnected from the ecosystems of our homes. It\u2019s a book of hard truths \u2013 I now know that I shed 50m flakes of skin every day, providing food for thousands of bacteria, and that cockroaches are basically our perfect interspecies Tinder-match. It also confronts our irrational relationship with cleanliness. Our modern instinct might be to swat a spider on the kitchen worktop or blitz creepy crawlies into oblivion with antimicrobial sprays, but we could be killing useful allies, according to Dunn: \u201cThe key thing is that your life is going to be full of life. And your only choice is which life. Our default is that we try to kill everything and fill our houses with stuff that\u2019s totally terrible for us. We might kill 99%, but that leaves 1% \u2013 and that 1% is never the good stuff.\u201d\nDunn is in Copenhagen for work and has agreed to come to my home to go through dusty corners and spider webs to point out where I might find some of the 5,000 species I bunk with. I suspect our 110-year-old house, shared with another family, is a fertile hunting ground, and Dunn seems optimistic. Using a screwdriver and tweezers, he pokes at light fittings and sifts through the basement, which can be a mould-friendly hangout during sticky, wet summers.\nWhile I\u2019m making coffee, Dunn lets out a yelp: \u201cOh yes, this is good!\u201d He has spotted a globe-shaped lamp hanging in the basement hallway, and in the bottom of the hazy glass cover is a Pollockesque pattern of dead wildlife. He tips the contents of the lamp on to a fold-out table and uses the tweezers to organise the harvest: two types of fly, a wasp, a meal moth, some aphids and various planthoppers. He takes a closer look at two of the dead flies: \u201cI can tell they are likely to be the same species, but I don\u2019t know for sure until I look at their genitals.\u201d\nHe turns to the silver-shiny meal moth. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just beautiful? It moved in with humans in ancient Egypt and has moved with humans again and again.\u201d\nBut how would it have ended up in our home?\n\u201cThis meal moth could have come in with grains.\u201d\nLike from a box of cereal?\n\u201cYes!\u201d\nDunn wants us to see our homes the way we see our gardens. There are pests and pathogens we need to control \u2013 those that make us sick \u2013 but we also want to preserve diversity. He says fewer than 100 species of bacteria, protists and viruses cause nearly all infectious diseases today. We try to keep these in check with vaccinations and antibiotics, and by washing our hands. But that leaves us with a jungle of tens of thousands of other species, many of which we know little about, but which Dunn\u2019s work suggests can often be more beneficial than harmful. For example, studies have shown that a higher diversity of bacteria on people\u2019s skin \u2013 bacteria linked to soil and plants \u2013 can reduce the risk of allergies. He also mentions the discovery of a bug that could be a new source of useful enzymes: by testing the microbes in the gut of the camel cricket, found in many American homes, Dunn\u2019s research team discovered bacteria that were able to break down industrial waste and turn it into energy. Making \u201ccool discoveries\u201d like this and enlisting the public to sieve through their homes for wildlife has spurred interest in a field he says has been neglected for too long.\n\u201cThe first drawings of microscopic life are all of household species,\u201d says Dunn, \u201cbut once we figured out the germ theory of disease it shifted, and both scientists and the public started to think that what was indoors belonged to pest control. Ecologists went to the Galapagos, we went to the rainforest, but it pushed us away from the home and it left us with this huge blind spot.\u201d\nDunn grew up in rural Michigan, hunting snakes and turtles, building tree forts and being \u201cmore curious about nature than your average child\u201d. Today, he is a professor in the department of biological sciences at North Carolina State University, where he has spent the past decade involving his colleagues and the public in studying the microbial landscape of our bodies and our homes. Part of the thrill of his new book is the sense of discovery and engagement with the world outside the lab. We head deeper into the basement, to the water-heating system, where one of the pipes has a leak; water drips into a chalk-crusted yellow bowl. Dunn grabs the bowl and tips it on to its side so we can see the puddle: \u201cYou could start a sourdough loaf with this.\u201d The water heater is an example, he says, of the extreme conditions we create in our houses. These specific ones are similar to what you might find in an Icelandic geyser, which means that our basement heating system now attracts bacteria that would normally thrive in volcanic hot springs. He moves on to a sprawling mess on the wall next to the boiler. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely spider web,\u201d he says excitedly. I feel a strange sense of pride and relief that my lack of cleaning is potentially boosting the ecosystem I inhabit. \u201cThis kind of spider is super-common in houses and can live for many, many years. This can grow up with your kid.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for an in-house pet spider, but while our natural inclination might be to shriek or stamp them out, Dunn wants us to protect them. \u201cThe natural enemies of the pests in our homes are very often, whether you like it or not, spiders,\u201d he writes in Never Home Alone: \u201cIf you kill the spiders in your home (and this is precisely what we do with many kinds of pesticide applications), you do so at your own expense.\u201d\nThe curse of pesticides brings us to the bathroom and another key area of his research: shower heads. Dunn and his team asked people from across the US and Europe to send in swabs from their shower heads. And within the biofilm \u2013 \u201ca fancy word for the gunk\u201d that builds up inside them \u2013 they discovered a pathogen, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), that is linked to lung disease in people with weak immune systems. What they didn\u2019t know was why this pathogen seemed more prevalent in some regions than others. \u201cThere was more of the NTM in the US and in particular in chlorinated water,\u201d says Dunn. They came to the conclusion that \u201cresidual chlorine kills all the competing bacteria and just leaves the NTM, which are chlorine-intolerant.\u201d And when the competition is eliminated, the pathogens thrive.\nHe unscrews the shower head from the hose and runs his finger along the rubber fitting. There is very little biofilm-gunk, which he credits to the quality of the local water supply. \u201cMost of Copenhagen still has untreated groundwater that relies on the wild biodiversity of crustaceans and bacteria to clean it. But if you break that \u2013 like we do in the US \u2013 it\u2019s super-expensive to fix it and it sucks. And it makes you sick.\u201d\nCrustaceans? \u201cYes, in some cases you can encounter small crustaceans in the tap water here. Denmark tastes like biodiversity.\u201d\nWe continue through the living room and kitchen. He pulls a book from the shelf to test for book lice, and picks up a log of firewood that has a spidery, grey pattern of reindeer lichen growing on the bark. In the kitchen he checks the dishwasher soaptray for a particular form of bacteria that is otherwise only found \u201cin the faeces of tropical fruit bats\u201d. Even our salt jar is apparently full of life: \u201cAlmost every crystal of salt has bacteria inside, and when you brine something in salt, those bacteria contribute to the flavours of the brine. The longer it sits in the brine, the more the microbes in the brine are going to contribute to it. Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d\nFood is an area where Dunn has found the influence of microbes and bacteria to be more palatable to people he meets. Food is alive \u2013 whether it\u2019s sourdough bread, kimchi or beer \u2013 and we are cool with that. Much more so than with the spider crawling across our windowsill. Dunn describes a study of how specific microbes found on bakers\u2019 skin influence sourdough starters and the flavour of bread. His team gathered 15 bakers at a facility in Belgium and tasked each of them with making sourdough starters from identical ingredients. When they tested the bakers\u2019 hands afterwards, it showed a close relationship between the microbial makeup of each starter and the bacteria found on the skin of the baker who made it. In his book Dunn describes how the bakers and biologists, drunk on spontaneously fermented Belgian beer, tucked into the breads and broke into an impromptu toast: \u201c\u2018To bread, and to microbes!\u2019 And to a house in which both are delicious. \u2018To bread and to microbes!\u2019 And houses in which we are all healthy. \u2018To bread and to microbes!\u2019 And to lives filled with wild species we have yet to study or understand, species that float like mysteries all around us and offer services we are only beginning to measure.\u201d\nOur house tour and inspection has come to an end. I\u2019m curious about the professor\u2019s verdict. Is this a happy, fungi-rich, insect-thriving home? \u201cYou have a lot of species that I think of as being part of a healthy house,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cTo me, your house is rich in biodiversity and seems dominated by those things that you either shouldn\u2019t worry about, or that are beneficial. Also, I don\u2019t see antimicrobial products all over the place.\u201d\nHe points to the leftovers of a coffee kombucha-glazed Danish pastry we were eating earlier. \u201cAnd then you have things that spark joy for you: fermented pastries, salt that\u2019s alive and healthy water from Denmark that we know is alive.\u201d\nWhether we like it or not, the species living in our homes are a measure of our lives, says Dunn, and his biggest fear is that we risk killing off that biodiversity. \u201cIf spiders scare the hell out of you, but you are willing to have one living in the corner, and maybe approach it sometimes to keep an eye on it, then that\u2019s great. That\u2019s much better than if your response is to jump away from it and spray pesticides all over your home, because that will only favour species that cause us harm and are resistant to pesticides. But it\u2019s not easy. This book won\u2019t solve [the problem], but maybe it will open some new conversations.\u201d\nAs he says goodbye and walks down the garden path, I spot a tiny moth in our living room, flapping frantically in the corner. I don\u2019t freak out or necessarily feel any great joy, but I leave the moth be. After all, there are 5,000 of us here, and you need to give your housemates some privacy.\n Never Home Alone by Rob Dunn is published in the UK by Basic Books (\u00a322.99) on 14 March.",

Or rather, it can\u2019t stop seeing you. The eye, whose \u201cpupil\u201d often comes in cobalt blue and is occasionally adorned with eyelashes, has been a recurring motif in fashion over the years, from the necklace worn by Willow Smith for Chanel\u2019s AW16 eyewear campaign, to Elie Saab\u2019s eye-embellished dresses from the spring 2017 couture collection, to Gigi Hadid\u2019s Eyelove and Eyelovemore shoe designs with Stuart Weitzman the same year. But, more recently, the trend has intensified.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nCoach 1941\u2019s 2019 Cruise collection put an evil eye on sweaters, while Nicole Miller\u2019s most recent show included a scattering of eyes across jackets, dresses and skirts. When Asos launched its homeware collection, Supply, at the beginning of the month it contained an \u201ceye see you\u201d cushion cover, bedspread and bath mat, as well as an eye-shaped mirror. Topshop is selling evil eye ankle socks and the symbol can be seen on sold out T-shirts from Urban Outfitters and on sweatshirts, bags and shoes at Kenzo.\nThe origins of the evil eye lie are talismanic, rooted in the belief that a malicious look or stare, often prompted by envy, can bring misfortune to those receiving it. However, wearing or displaying one of these in amulet form \u2013 confusingly also referred to as the evil eye \u2013 can help ward off said curse. Others believe that receiving undeserved levels of praise or attention can also lead to evil eye-based misfortune. Either way, the concept is one which transcends religions, generations and cultures, with early versions thought to date back to 3,300 BC, although the symbol has remained particularly prevalent in Mediterranean countries.\nThese symbols can often be found in homes, painted on walls, doors and furniture. Historically though, it has been jewellery where the evil eye is most ubiquitous. In Turkey, handmade glass bead versions of the eye, known as nazars, are still worn as talismans.\n\u201cThe trend reminds me of the opulent Egyptian-inspired fashions of the 1920s, when the evil eye was sometimes referenced in designs for jewellery, headdresses and beading and embroidery,\u201d says Susanna Cordner, a senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion. \u201cConversely, in the 30s, Elsa Schiaparelli frequently included padlocks in her designs as a supposed means of warding off the evil eye.\u201d\nFashion has long been drawn to talismanic designs, from pendants bearing the image of saints to the hamsa (a palm-shaped amulet). According to the fashion search site Lyst, necklaces and rings are the most searched categories when it comes to evil eye-inspired designs, with Missoma, Sydney Evan and Tory Burch the most viewed labels.\nCordner also raises question of whether the eye\u2019s popularity is a reflection of \u201ccontemporary anxieties \u2026 drawing us back to talismans we found comfort in in the past\u201d. In terms of their fashionability, the evil eye has followed a similar trajectory to crystals and certain aspects of the occult, coming to exist in spaces that explore everything from mysticism to wellness. On Instagram, a search for \u201cevil eye tattoos\u201d prompts 6,926 results \u2013 almost twice as many as \u201castrology tattoos\u201d at 3,919. Doubtless they are aesthetically pleasing, a symbol that embraces symmetry and leaves room or originality \u2013 but is there more to it? In uncertain times, it makes sense that we would turn to emblems that offer some comfort \u2013 and perhaps a horseshoe and rabbit\u2019s foot no longer cut it.\n\u201cCoincidentally \u2013 or not, depending on your own belief system \u2013 the founders of several of the most significant fashion houses today \u2013 Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, for example \u2013 were extremely superstitious, with particular interests in tarot and astrology,\u201d says Cordner. \u201cIn contrast, their successors have gone on to translate \u2013 or arguably appropriate \u2013 that private belief into a public muse.\u201d\nGiven that Pope Francis last year voiced his disapproval regarding the wearing of crucifixes as fashion items \u2013 rather than because of their religious significance \u2013 could trend-based appropriation of the evil eye prompt similar condemnation? Certainly there\u2019s an argument that it should, yet the fact that the evil eye spans cultures and belief systems may be why this symbol has escaped more damning accusations of cultural appropriation.\nThe French luxury fashion house Kenzo is one of the most prolific users of the eye motif, referring to it as \u201can emblem for the modern era of the house\u201d. Yet, to Cordner, it less resembles the evil eye and more the \u201clover\u2019s eye\u201d jewellery designs of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\u201cWearing a tiny portrait of your lover\u2019s eye as a piece of jewellery was an illicit and intimate way of showing your love,\u201d she says. \u201cThis would completely change the tone of the design. It becomes an act of affection rather than of superstition.\u201d\nFor Kenzo, the latest eye-inspired addition to its accessories line is an eye-bearing bag. \u201cWe called it the \u2018Tali\u2019 bag, as it felt appropriate to carry the eye as a talisman for good fortune and luck,\u201d say the brand\u2019s creative directors, Carol Lim and Humberto Leon. As they put it: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to feel that type of karma every day of their lives?\u201d",

        "content": "Climate change and human development have pushed Florida to the brink. Now conservationists are finding fresh hope in an unlikely form\nAt first pass, there seems little amiss in the idyll of Florida Bay. A wedge-shaped expanse of water between the Everglades and the Florida Keys, it is a clean, sun-dappled 1,000 sq mile playground for reddening tourists, grizzled fishermen and loud-shirted locals.\nBut the consequences of Florida\u2019s century-long attempt to bend the environment to its will aren\u2019t hard to find. Starved of fresh water from a reworking of its natural plumbing further north and menaced by seas rising due to climate change, the Everglades and its adjoining bay are teetering at the edge of existential crisis.\n\u201cThe patient is on life support at the moment,\u201d said Steve Davis, senior ecologist at conservation not-for-profit Everglades Foundation, describing what was once a prime fishing area in the western portion of the bay.\nA severe slump in rainfall in 2015 meant salinity levels rocketed in the bay, with the water becoming twice as salty in the ocean. This led to the die-off of seagrass, crucial for local marine life, leaving the water matted with deceased vegetation.\nThe water here is shallow but still impenetrably murky, with the odd strand of seagrass floating by. Hurricane Irma tore up much of what remained last year, uprooting mangroves that had managed to survive the surging salt.\n\u201cNotice how turbid and brown the water is,\u201d Davis said, standing up on his skiff and peering into the bay. \u201cThis area, just last year smelled like death. It smelled like rotten eggs for almost three months.\u201d Shark Bight, a cove found further north off the Everglades, is a prime birdwatching and fishing paradise turned \u201cmud pit\u201d, Davis said.\nEddie Yarborough, a leathery fishing guide who has spent the last 25 years traversing the bay for trout, redfish and snook, likens the water to \u201cchocolate milk\u201d. Yarborough morosely added: \u201cThe water used to be so clear you could see the seagrass move back and forth. Now you can\u2019t see the bottom. The dead water sort of moves around the bay and you think \u2018I\u2019ve just gotta get out of here.\u2019\u201d\nDecades of often poisonous politics have pushed the Everglades, one of the largest and perhaps best-known wetlands in the world, down the path of entropy and potential collapse. A sweeping plan to restore the Everglades was passed by Congress in 2000 and promptly stalled.\nNow less than half of its original size, the Everglades is beset by encroaching development and nutrient pollution and riddled with invasive species, such as the Burmese python, and exotic plants, such as Brazilian pepper and Australian pine.\nBut conservationists have fresh hope in the unlikely corporeal form of Ron DeSantis, the new Republican governor of Florida who roused national attention with a campaign video that vowed his children\u2019s fealty to Donald Trump and a televised debate where his opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum, accused his supporters of racism.\nSince taking office in January, DeSantis has taken an unTrumpian approach to the environment, outlining a $2.5bn plan over four years to rescue the ailing Everglades. The plan would tackle local water pollution, protect springs and finish raising the Tamiami Trail, a highway that links Miami and Florida\u2019s west coast by cutting across the Everglades, to allow water to flow south to the ecosystem.\nDeSantis has called for the resignations of the entire South Florida Water Management District board, which controls water policy for the region, and has appointed two members \u2013 Ron \u201cAlligator Ron\u201d Bergeron and Chauncey Goss \u2013 who both have strong green credentials. Florida has even thrown itself into a legal battle to halt a controversial oil drilling project in the north-eastern reaches of the Everglades.\n\u201cOur water and natural resources are the foundation of our economy and our way of life in Florida,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThe protection of water resources is one of the most pressing issues facing our state.\u201d Environmentalists have been cheered by the contrast from the previous governor, Rick Scott, who cut funding for environmental programs. DeSantis isn\u2019t exactly a global warming warrior \u2013 he prefers \u201cTeddy Roosevelt conservationist\u201d \u2013 but he will at least utter the words \u201cclimate change\u201d, unlike Scott, who reportedly banned the term.\n\u201cIt feels like more has happened in the past few months than in the past 25 years,\u201d said Eric Eikenberg, the chief executive of the Everglades Foundation.\nThe problems faced by the Everglades aren\u2019t new or unexplored. Not long after developers started draining the wetlands for agriculture and paved it over for roads and houses, the effects started rippling through the system.\nBy the 1960s, scientists had calculated that while around 2m acre feet (2.5bn cubic metres) of water once flowed in a shallow river of grass from central Florida to the state\u2019s southern tip, the volume of this conveyor belt had been cut in half.\nThe Everglades\u2019 link to its headwater in Lake Okeechobee has been severed, with water diverted via canals for agriculture, particularly sugar. Without the nourishing freshwater, the ecosystem further south has become saltier and prone to disastrous events, such as happened in 2015, when pristine water turns into a muddy slush, causing fish to flee or die. The region is again in mild drought, meaning that rainwater isn\u2019t currently coming to the Everglades\u2019 salvation.\n\u201cThe problem is we\u2019re just not getting enough water,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe only get about a third of the water in the eastern Florida Bay that we received historically. A national park, a world heritage site, an international biosphere reserve, and we\u2019re starving it of fresh water.\u201d\nOne solution, Davis and other advocates believe, is to create a vast reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee that would store water intended for the Everglades. The water would filter south through a system of marshes to deliver millions of gallons of replenishment to the ecosystem. DeSantis backed the plan and recently penned a letter to Trump, alongside Florida senators Scott and Marco Rubio, to ask for funding.\nThere is political expediency in altering the current scenario where the water in Lake Okeechobee is discharged to the west and east, via the Caloosahatchee and the St Lucie rivers respectively, when it fills up and threatens to overflow. Laden with chemicals from nearby agriculture and warmed in temperatures that are climbing as the climate heats up, the water is the perfect spawning ground for toxic blue-green algal blooms.\nSeparate \u201cred tide\u201d algal outbreaks in the ocean ravaged Florida last year, leading to beaches being closed, horrified dog owners who saw their pets poisoned, and hundreds of tons of dead fish and manatees piling up along the Gulf coast.\nThe tourism industry, worth about $67bn annually to Florida, trembled. The breakdown of the natural chain of life was so starkly apparent to Floridians that it became a battleground in the midterm elections.\n\u201cVoters got hyped up about red tide and said \u2018we want the government to act,\u2019\u201d said Rene Price, an expert in the hydrology of the Everglades at Florida International University. \u201cThere was a large outcry and it seems like we have got some momentum now.\u201d\nThe Everglades faces the threat of salty inundation on all sides, with the sea level at its edge rising by about 5in since 2001. Price said this accelerating climate trend, driven by the melting of glaciers and expanding sea water, will see the Everglades retreat further north. There will be miles and miles of new Florida Bay.\n\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t be sitting on our hands,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe have the capability to stem the tide by increasing the flow of fresh water. This isn\u2019t the time to give up.\u201d\nOliver Milman traveled to the Everglades as a guest of the Everglades Foundation.",

And YouTube said it had seen no evidence of videos showing or promoting the Momo challenge on its platform.\nThe NSPCC said there is no confirmed evidence that the phenomenon is actually posing a threat to British children and said they have received more phone calls about it from members of the media than concerned parents.\nA Samaritans spokesperson was similarly sceptical, saying: \u201cThese stories being highly publicised and starting a panic means vulnerable people get to know about it and that creates a risk.\u201d They recommended media outlets read their guidelines on reporting suicide and suggested press coverage is \u201craising the risk of harm\u201d.\n\u201cCurrently we\u2019re not aware of any verified evidence in this country or beyond linking Momo to suicide,\u201d said the Samaritans spokesperson. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important is parents and people who work with children concentrate on broad online safety guidelines.\u201d\nChild safety campaigners say the story has spread due to legitimate concerns about online child safety, the sharing of unverified material on local Facebook groups, and official comments from British police forces and schools which are based on little hard evidence.\nWhile some concerned members of the public have rushed to share posts warning of the suicide risk, there are fears that they have exacerbated the situation by scaring children and spreading the images and the association with self-harm.\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s done with best intentions, publicising this issue has only piqued curiosity among young people,\u201d said Kat Tremlett, harmful content manager at the UK Safer Internet Centre.\nThe rumour mill appears to have created a feedback loop, where news coverage of the Momo challenge is prompting schools or the police to warn about the supposed risks posed by the Momo challenge, which has in turn produced more news stories warning about the challenge.\nTremlett said she was now hearing of children who are \u201cwhite with worry\u201d as a result of media coverage about a supposed threat that did not previously exist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that is perpetuated into being some kind of reality,\u201d she said.\nAlthough the Momo challenge has been circulating on social media and among schoolchildren in various forms since last year, the recent coverage appears to have started with a single warning posted by a mother on a Facebook group for residents of Westhoughton, a small Lancashire town on the edge of Bolton. This post, based on an anecdote she had heard from her son at school, went viral before being picked up by her local newspaper and then covered by outlets from around the world.\nThe supernatural \u201cMomo\u201d image, originally from an artwork made for a Japanese horror show exhibition, has been circulating on the internet for several years but last summer became attached to unverified claims that teenagers were being prompted to kill or harm themselves by messages on WhatsApp.\nMany campaigners in the child safety sector have been reluctant to issue statements for fear of fanning the flames of the story but are changing direction after seeing the sheer number of dubious stories written to attract clicks on the issue.\nHundreds of separate articles have been written on the topic by British news websites in the last three days, dominating the most-read lists on tabloid news sites. These include explainers for concerned parents on how to protect children from the supposed risks of the challenge and claims about the acts that children are supposedly committing after seeing the images. Celebrities such as Stacey Solomon have weighed in and expressed their concerns, creating even more justifications for headlines.\nMultiple police forces have issued formal warnings about the supposed risks of the Momo challenge, in addition to hundreds of schools. In one example, a Hull primary school posted on its Facebook page an unsourced claim that clips of the Momo challenge image are \u201chacking into children\u2019s programmes\u201d, with no evidence of what is meant by this claim.\nA YouTube spokesperson said the claims were completely false: \u201cContrary to press reports, we have not received any evidence of videos showing or promoting the Momo challenge on YouTube. Content of this kind would be in violation of our policies and removed immediately.\u201d\nSeveral outlets, including the Mirror and many local newspapers, have also claimed that the Momo game has been linked to 130 teen suicides in Russia, with no supporting evidence.\nAn identical claim was made in 2017 about a similar supposed viral suicide craze called Blue Whale, which was also linked to exactly 130 teen suicides in Russia. This figures came from a much-criticised single report in the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, with later reporting suggesting that not a single death could be conclusively linked to the game.\n\u201cWe almost need to stop talking about the issue for it to not be an issue any more,\u201d said Tremlett.\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

        "content": "Medical experts who counter misinformation are weathering coordinated attacks. Now some are fighting back\nWhen the naturopath Elias Kass testified before a Washington state senate committee on 20 February with a baby on his chest and a pacifier in his hand, he knew that his arguments would be unpopular with the anti-vaccine activists in the room. Amid a measles outbreak that has infected 66 people so far, legislators were considering a bill to eliminate personal and philosophical exemptions for childhood vaccinations, and Kass was one of several practitioners to speak in support of the measure.\nKass faced some anger in the hallway after the hearing, he said, with one person calling him \u201ca disgusting liar\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t until several hours later that \u201cthe shit hit the fan\u201d. That\u2019s when Kass realized that his Facebook page was being flooded with one-star reviews calling him everything from a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and a \u201cpedophile\u201d to a \u201cNazi pharma shill\u201d and \u201cscumbag shilling for infanticide\u201d. Kass disabled the Yelp-like reviews feature on the page, but that didn\u2019t stop the onslaught, which moved into the page\u2019s comments and across the ecosystem of anti-vaxx Facebook pages and groups. By Monday, five days after his brief testimony, he had compiled a photo gallery with hundreds of screenshots of abusive comments.\nKass is only the latest pro-vaccine health practitioner to be subjected to an online harassment campaign by anti-vaxxers. Networks of closed Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members have become staging grounds for campaigns that victims say are intended to silence and intimidate pro-vaccine voices on social media. The harassment only exacerbates an online ecosystem rife with anti-vaccine misinformation, thanks in part to Facebook\u2019s recommendation algorithms and targeted advertising.\n\u201cTheir goal is to tell my patients what a bad person I am so I lose business,\u201d Kass told the Guardian by phone, five days into his ordeal. \u201cIt\u2019s made me reluctant to engage online.\u201d\nThe harassment of Kass appears to have been at least partially instigated by Larry Cook and Erin Elizabeth, two anti-vaccine activists who have built large Facebook platforms.\nCook has gained notoriety as a full-time anti-vaxxer who has raised nearly $80,000 on GoFundMe to pay for fear-mongering anti-vaccine Facebook ads which he targets at mothers. His Facebook page, Stop Mandatory Vaccinations (SMV), has about 130,000 followers, while the related closed SMV Facebook group has more than 150,000 members.\nThe former executive director of a professional organization for naturopaths, Cook has various online ventures, including an anti-vaccine YouTube channel, a $99 online training course about social media activism and a $3.95 ebook advising tenants on how to take their landlord to small claims court. He specializes in emotive anti-vaccine propaganda videos featuring parents and babies.\nErin Elizabeth runs the website Health Nut News, links to which have been banned by Pinterest for consistently promoting harmful health misinformation. Her Facebook page has more than 500,000 followers, and she also runs a closed Facebook group, Holistic Lives Matter, which has about 53,000 members.\nThese Facebook groups are highly active and entirely one-sided: because they are closed groups, members are screened before they are allowed to join, and pro-vaccine voices are quickly banned as \u201ctrolls\u201d. Another group containing abusive comments about Kass, \u201cVaccineChoices \u2013 Fact VS Fiction, Conversations & Research\u201d, is run by the prominent anti-vaxxer Sherri Tenpenny and has more than 40,000 members.\nBoth Cook and Elizabeth posted links to Kass\u2019s Facebook page with their group members on the evening of 20 February, along with posts or screenshots criticizing Kass for his testimony. On Health Nut News, Elizabeth also published a post about Kass, which included the directive, \u201cCLICK HERE for the \u2018naturopath\u2019s\u2019 Facebook page\u201d. The message was implicit: go get him.\nThe Guardian contacted Elizabeth for comment. Cook responded to queries about harassment by email, saying: \u201cMy intent is to ensure that those who oppose vaccine mandates know who favor vaccine mandates just like your intent is to name those who are against vaccine mandates.\u201d\n\u201cIt shows what a linchpin Facebook is,\u201d Kass said. \u201cThat is their vehicle. Without that vehicle, who knows what they would be accomplishing.\u201d\nFacebook does not \u201ctolerate harassment\u201d, a spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe use a combination of AI, machine learning and manual review to proactively detect and remove harassment throughout our platform \u2013 including posts in groups and pages. And since we find that comments can be used for harm, we\u2019re working to give people the ability to hide or delete multiple comments at once.\u201d\nBut Kass, who has been honored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and profiled in Time magazine for his approach to persuading hesitant parents to vaccinate, said that he is concerned the campaign will affect his ability to connect with parents, now that he has been labeled \u201can enemy\u201d.\nThe harassment has also created paranoia, he said. \u201cNow, when we\u2019re at the grocery store, if someone is looking at me, I\u2019m wondering, \u2018Did you see a meme where I had an X over my face and was holding a bunch of aborted babies?\u2019\u201d\nThe power of harassment campaigns to dissuade pro-vaccine voices from engaging online raises questions about Facebook\u2019s approach to anti-vaccine propaganda. Despite pressure from public health experts and politicians, the company has not banned anti-vaccine misinformation, which it says can be better addressed with accurate counter-speech than with censorship.\n\u201cThe idea that we can have counter-speech when [Facebook] groups become brigade mobs is ludicrous,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an expert in online misinformation and co-founder of Vaccinate California. \u201cIt makes just participating as an everyday citizen a high-stakes ordeal.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at the point where doctors are creating their own anti-vaxx social media attack response teams to help other doctors,\u201d DiResta added.\nOne such rapid response team is being organized by Dr Todd Wolynn and Chad Hermann, the CEO and communications director of Kids Plus Pediatrics (KPP) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re being attacked, we\u2019ll light the signal fires of Gondor, and you\u2019ll have pro-science, pro-vaccine cavalry come to your aid,\u201d Hermann said of the nascent project, called \u201cShots Heard Round the World\u201d.\nWolynn and Hermann are self-described social media evangelists for pediatricians. For years, they have encouraged practitioners to invest in digital communications in order to fill the void of evidence-based medical information on social media sites.\nIn September 2017, their practice was targeted by what Hermann described as a \u201ccoordinated terrorist attack from inside an anti-vaxx Facebook group\u201d, which woke them up to the need for a means to rally the troops behind science.\nThe harassment campaign was touched off by a video KPP had produced and published in August 2017 to encourage uptake of the HPV vaccine. The video was initially well received and effective, Hermann said, prompting an uptick in queries and appointments from parents.\nBut at 1.15pm on 15 September \u2013 three weeks after the video was initially posted on Facebook \u2013 the first negative comment came in: \u201cIs this some kind of joke? This vaccine kills people.\u201d By the end of the day, the practice\u2019s Facebook page had received more than 250 comments from anti-vaxx accounts. By the time the troll storm leveled off a week later, Hermann says that he had banned more than 800 accounts and deleted more than 10,000 comments.\nThe anti-vaxxers also went after the practice\u2019s Yelp ratings and Google maps ratings. Hermann and Wolynn believe that the campaign originated in Tenpenny\u2019s closed Facebook group, based on screenshots shared with them in the aftermath.\n\u201cI never suggest or encourage any Facebook group or individual members to engage in social media harassment schemes,\u201d Tenpenny said by email. \u201cAs you logically know, it is impossible to control what a Facebook member chooses to do or how they choose to behave.\u201d\nTenpenny said that she has asked people not to \u201cpersonally attack anyone\u201d, but does \u201cencourage confident, articulate, intelligent and factual responses online or within comment threads\u201d in order to provide a \u201ccounterpoint\u201d to pro-vaccine messages.\nThe campaign against KPP also found support inside SMV. After the video was shared with the Facebook group, members left hundreds of comments urging each other to go to KPP\u2019s Facebook page and sharing screenshots of the negative reviews and comments they left. As the comment thread stretched into the hundreds, members also shared links to the practice\u2019s Yelp and Google pages, as well as the phone number for the practice.\n\u201cThey\u2019re down to 1.8 stars lol,\u201d one user posted, with a screenshot of the practice\u2019s Google review page. \u201cYes!\u201d another user responded. \u201cLet\u2019s get them with yelp too. Bastards. Haha.\u201d\nWhile Yelp has a robust process for protecting businesses from fraudulent reviews, KPP\u2019s Google rating remains depressed by one-star reviews referencing the HPV video, something Wolynn noted could create \u201creal financial harm\u201d for medical practices.\nAfter weathering the storm, Wolynn and Hermann decided to fight back. They worked on an observational study of the harassment campaign. And they\u2019ve doubled down on their evangelism, working on a toolkit to battle the anti-vaxx backlash.\n\u201cMany providers and even whole hospitals are afraid of posting pro-vaccine material on Facebook simply for fear of putting a bullseye on their backs,\u201d Hermann said. \u201cWhen they stop posting that information, it leaves a vacuum, and we all know who is going to fill that.\u201d\nHermann said that he does not think Facebook should ban groups like Sherri Tenpenny\u2019s or SMV, but the social network should provide pages with tools to protect themselves from coordinated attacks.\n\u201cIt seems to me that it would take Facebook about 10 minutes to allow us to ban or block every member of Sherri Tenpenny\u2019s group,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no problem with them wanting to stay in their echo chambers, but this is the digital equivalent of 39,000 people storming into our waiting room and screaming at us and our patients.\u201d",

And this is how you should talk to an adversary\u2019\nPete Souza: photographing the real Barack Obama\nI wasn\u2019t supposed to be here for this picture. It was taken on the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings \u2013 all the heads of state had gathered there and were coming out of an impromptu luncheon. The official photographers from each country had been kicked out \u2013 we were all supposed to leave the building. But I have a knack of making myself small and sticking around.\nThe shot shows the kind of interaction President Obama had with President Putin during his tenure. It was 2014, a particularly tense time between the two countries. You can see in the facial expressions and gestures that this was a very serious conversation. There are interpreters stood behind them, but I get the impression from Putin\u2019s face that he understood exactly what was being said in English.\nI was within earshot. I can\u2019t recount specifically what they said, but I knew the subject matter. Can I say what it was? It was about \u2026 some of Russia\u2019s actions in the world. Let\u2019s leave it at that.\nThis conversation went on for a while: they weren\u2019t thinking about me. To them, I was just one of many people in the room, coming and going in different directions. I started out shooting horizontally and tighter, and then switched to vertical, backing up to show their entire bodies. Compositionally, that seemed to show the body language better.\nI first met Obama on his very first day in the US senate in 2005. I was impressed by the way he interacted with people, not just on the podium but on a one-to-one level. And from a photographer\u2019s standpoint, I saw right away how comfortable he was in the presence of a camera. I could be in some pretty intimate situations with him and me being there with a camera didn\u2019t seem to bother him at all.\nI would tell friends that I was photographing a senator who was going to become the president of the United States. But on other occasions I\u2019d see him deliver these long-winded answers during town hall meetings and wonder if he really had it in him. He was so policy-oriented that he would sometimes give 10- or 15-minute answers when people wanted a quicker response. I sensed he was losing some people, but he got better at that over time.\nI call our relationship a professional friendship. I don\u2019t go to his house for dinner with him and Michelle, but I would get invited to the holiday party that he has for his office. How would I describe him? I\u2019d say he was intelligent and very disciplined \u2013 about work, exercise, diet. And he\u2019s very competitive in all aspects of his life. We\u2019d do these long flights on Air Force One where we would play the card game Spades and he would be really competitive. That\u2019s just his nature.\nI took 1.9m photos in my time as White House photographer. I was with my cameras at the White House every day for essentially eight years. I wasn\u2019t photographing every second of every day, but I was always ready to. The stressful aspect was not the job but its effect on my personal life, because I felt I always needed to be with Obama. You never know when history is going to take place. So for eight years my personal life was on hold. By the time his presidency ended I was worn out.\nI also worked as White House photographer for Ronald Reagan. That was a different era. I was a young man, Reagan was in his 70s and I didn\u2019t know him that well. I didn\u2019t have the same sort of access that I had with Obama. We were shooting film and there was no such thing as social media. And Reagan was just a different type of person \u2013 very formal, didn\u2019t do nearly as much \u2013 and so my coverage wasn\u2019t nearly as exhaustive.\nI\u2019ve noticed how you don\u2019t see any behind-the-scenes photographs of Trump. What you see is the reality show \u2013 a cabinet meeting or oval office meeting where the entire press corps is there the whole time. I don\u2019t feel like there are any unguarded moments.\nObviously the investigations into Russian collusion gives this picture an extra layer of meaning. It shows the way you should interact with the president of Russia. It should be tense. Trump still does not acknowledge that Putin is the guy who directed people to meddle with our election. Instead, he interacts with him as if they\u2019re best friends. This is our adversary, and this is the way you should talk to an adversary.\n Pete Souza will be speaking at The Photography Show at the NEC, Birmingham, 16-19 March; www.photographyshow.com.\nBorn: New Bedford, Massachusetts, 1954.\nTrained: Boston University and Kansas State University\nInfluences: Henri Cartier-Bresson and W Eugene Smith,\nHigh point: \u201cBeing employed as chief official White House photographer for President Obama.\u201d\nLow point: \u201cGoing freelance in 1996 \u2013 I was broke.\u201d\nTop tip: \u201cShoot pictures every day.\u201d",

        "content": "In this often wordless drama, Charlotte Rampling brings an intelligent intensity to the role of a woman whose ageing husband has been jailed\nExperiencing the formal, compositional chill of this film is like opening the door of a freezer cabinet and putting your head inside. The Italian film-maker Andrea Pallaoro directs and co-writes, and the star is Charlotte Rampling, whose performance won her the Volpi cup for best actress at the Venice film festival two years ago. It is the portrait of a lonely, unhappy life and the action is almost wordless, in a series of scenes often recorded by fixed camera positions that (for a while) withhold from the audience the full truth of what is happening. It is perhaps inspired by Chantal Akerman\u2019s 1975 film Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai Au Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.\nHannah (Rampling) lives alone in a modest apartment, her face an enigmatic mask. In fact, the film itself has what you could call Resting Charlotte Rampling Face: austerely intelligent, unsmilingly beautiful, intimidating, cold in a way that speaks of sadness protectively walled up in dignity and courtesy. It is an expression that could too easily be mistaken for simple contempt or self-disgust.\nShe has a job working as a cleaner for a wealthy woman in an elegant, modernist house, and she has become reasonably friendly with the woman\u2019s young son whose blindness evidently facilitates the nearest thing Hannah now has to intimacy with anyone. It\u2019s a Frankenstein\u2019s-monster exile.\nHannah appears a bit above this kind of work \u2013 though this may be an illusion created by the impression of martyred, fastidious hauteur. Maybe it is the only employment possible, because Hannah\u2019s ageing husband (Andr\u00e9 Wilms) has been sent to prison, for a disgrace that we can just about imagine. Hannah gets silent phone calls and angry bangs on her door, an ordeal she accepts with calm.\nPerhaps Hannah has never been a very demonstrative person. Pallaoro shows how rare and subdued emotions are with her by having Hannah simply smile at her husband when she sees him at visiting hours and he asks: \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d But Hannah is not incapable of expressing emotions. There is a wrenching scene in which she sobs with despair \u2013 in private.\nHannah has accepted her husband\u2019s word that he is innocent and she is just about keeping things together. What is helping is her membership of an amateur theatrical group that is rehearsing Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House. The scenes of her participation in their various vocal and physical exercises, and the juxtaposition of these scenes with her day-to-day life as Hannah imperceptibly deteriorates, give the movie its flavour and its mystery.\nShe has poured her denied emotions into this drama group. The sound of the voice warm-ups, with their stylised toneless singing, sound like Hannah\u2019s own ventriloquised wails of anguish. She can act a role; she can put on a show; she can impersonate someone else \u2013 someone trapped. However, the nature of the play is probably not as important as the improv-type games being played. It is the nearest thing to a 12-step group for Hannah. But any therapy it provides is illusory.\nHannah has no friends in the group. There is no question of going for a cheerful coffee and chat with some of them after the session. She seems to prize her solitude here as much as anywhere.\nElsewhere, we see Hannah going about her business, chugging stoically around on the M\u00e9tro, and in one crucial scene doing so carrying a cake in a large and precarious cardboard box. We also see her in the swimming pool at the sports club and in the changing room where her nakedness is revealed without prurience: another aspect of Hannah\u2019s affectless candour, which the film itself intuits. The pool, the M\u00e9tro, the streets: these are public spaces in which she is utterly alone, at once crushed and hollowed out.\nMy only reservation with the movie is that I found myself wondering if the drama-group scenes could be extended and developed, even to the extent of Hannah taking part in actual production, in front of an audience, and we could thus savour the eerily refined spectacle of her denial and alienation. Yet perhaps that isn\u2019t the point and would overbalance the form of the picture and compromise the essence of Hannah\u2019sbarricaded privacy. It is a haunting portrait of emotional undeadness.",

        "content": "Beijing\u2019s new airport is just the latest megaproject that has seen China pour more concrete every two years than the US did in the entire 20th century\nIn the suburbs south of Beijing, what could one day be the world\u2019s busiest airport is rapidly taking shape. Nicknamed \u201cthe starfish\u201d due to the striking design by Zaha Hadid Architects, the Beijing Daxing international airport is set to open in October, and could eventually handle more than 100 million passengers a year.\nWhile the 52,000-tonne steel exoskeleton covering the airport\u2019s six concourses immediately catches the eye, what lies beneath is familiar to many Chinese mega-projects: concrete \u2013 1.6m cubic metres of it.\nConstruction of the new airport hub started in 2014, and is one of the largest infrastructure projects initiated by the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in an effort to jumpstart China\u2019s slowing economy and place Beijing firmly on the international stage.\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nLocated 67km south of the capital, the airport sprawls across 780,000 sq metres \u2013 about a third of the size of Edinburgh. It aims to process 72 million passengers a year, and will have four runways by 2025, but there is a longer-term vision for additional runways and talk of 200 million passengers. Beijing\u2019s existing international airport in the north-east, which will stay open, already handles around 96 million passengers a year.\nOne group who won\u2019t benefit from the cutting-edge contemporary design are the 20,000 people evicted from Daxing\u2019s villages to make way for construction. Another 20 villages are slated for relocation after the airport opens due to concerns over noise pollution.\nThe new airport is just the latest chapter in the story of how China became the concrete superpower of the 21st century. Since 2003, China has poured more cement every two years than the US managed in the entire 20th century. Even after a dip in recent years, China uses almost half the world\u2019s concrete. The construction sector \u2013 roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other concrete-and-steel projects \u2013 accounted for one-third of the expansion of the Chinese economy in 2017.\nChina is already home to the largest concrete structure in the world \u2013 the Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River. Sometimes touted as China\u2019s \u201cnew Great Wall\u201d, the dam includes 27.2m cubic metres of concrete and its hydroelectric power station is the world\u2019s largest power station in terms of capacity.\nLike all of China\u2019s concrete achievements, the Three Gorges Dam has been mired in controversy. Around 1.4 million people were displaced by the project, and there were complaints that the rehousing settlements were inadequate or that compensation money disappeared into local government coffers. More than 100 workers died in the construction process, and archaeological and cultural sites were flooded. None of this prevented Li Yongan, general manager of the Three Gorges Corporation, from declaring in 2006 that the dam was \u201cthe grandest project the Chinese people have undertaken in thousands of years\u201d.\nLi only had to wait seven more years to be outdone by yet another Chinese feat of concrete. In 2013, the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project opened, connecting the Grand Canal in China\u2019s east with the capital in the north. The project is a multi-decade plan to divert the water from China\u2019s lush south to its arid north, where water scarcity is an acute problem. The waterway has already cost around $80bn (\u00a361bn), making it the most expensive infrastructure project in the world. In the first phase alone, it has used more than double the amount of concrete in the Three Gorges Dam: 65m cubic metres. The project ultimately aims to transport fresh water a distance of more than 4,300km.\nSuch ambitious infrastructure projects require a ready and vast supply of concrete. It is a demand that has been easily met by the country\u2019s cement supply: in 2017, China produced 2.4bn tonnes of the stuff, more than the rest of the world combined. But China\u2019s total capacity for cement, the main ingredient in concrete, is closer to 4bn tonnes. This discrepancy is accounted for by thousands of unused or underused cement factories that litter China\u2019s industrial heartlands, a relic of years of rampant supply-side investment, supported by cheap loans to state-owned companies that disregarded profits in favour of growth, employment and kickbacks.\nChina\u2019s overcapacity problem, particularly in heavy industry, is well-documented. In February last year, the country\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that capacity-expansion in the cement industry would be strictly off-limits for the rest of the year, with the aim of reducing capacity by a 10th by 2020.\nSuch curbs on production don\u2019t yet seem to be putting a halt on China\u2019s concrete love story, though. In October 2018, the world\u2019s longest sea bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was officially opened by Xi. At 55km, it is also the longest fixed link in the world \u2013 20 times the length of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. It took 1.08m cubic metres of concrete, nine years and $18.3bn (\u00a314bn) to build the snaking structure, which consists of bridges, artificial islands and tunnels.\nIn China, where concrete goes, controversy follows. The first hiccup in the mega-bridge was a specifically concrete-related one. In December 2017, a Hong Kong laboratory technician was jailed for eight months for falsifying concrete compression test results for the bridge. Ray Chan, a Hong Kong lawmaker, said the scandal \u201ccreated a crisis of trust in the [Hong Kong] government\u2019s ability to monitor and ensure the credibility of large-scale construction projects\u201d, reported the Hong Kong Free Press.\nBut the crisis of trust was not just about safety standards. The million cubic metres of concrete also represent mainland China\u2019s growing reach into the supposedly autonomous regions of Macau and Hong Kong. Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said last year that the bridge was a \u201cpolitically driven mega-project without urgent need\u201d, given the existing transport links between Hong Kong and the mainland. Others have called it a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d and an unfair burden on Hong Kong taxpayers.\nChina\u2019s concrete mania shows little sign of abating. High-rise apartments are constantly being added to the cities\u2019 edges to accommodate the never-ending flow of migrants from the countryside, and headline projects such as the new Beijing airport or the Hong Kong bridge are considered prestigious achievements.\nOn a more humble scale, the world\u2019s longest 3D-printed concrete bridge was unveiled in Shanghai earlier this year. It is a feat of engineering, constructed from 176 individual 3D printed concrete units.\nAs Xu Weiguo, the architect of the 3D bridge, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get and widely used in construction projects.\u201d After all, he adds, \u201cconcrete is the cheapest construction material in China\u201d.\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

It will also increase the pressure on western chimpanzees, which have declined by 80% in the past 20 years, and are now considered critically endangered \u2013 the highest level of risk \u2013 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nThe highlands of Guinea are home to Africa\u2019s healthiest remaining population of about 16,500 western chimpanzees. In most other countries, this subspecies is either extinct or perilously threatened in populations of less than 100 individuals.\nThe Moyen-Bafing reserve was established in 2016 as a \u201cchimpanzee offset\u201d and funded by two mining companies \u2013 Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e and Guinea Alumina Corporation \u2013 in return for permission to open mineral excavation sites inside other territories of the primate.\nRebecca Kormos, a primatologist who has been researching the animal for decades, has warned that a dam inside the park would have the biggest impact a development project has ever had on chimpanzees.\n\u201cI hope Sinohydro will reconsider engaging in a project that could drive the western chimpanzee into extinction. Once a species goes, it\u2019s gone forever,\u201d she said.\nShe estimates 800 to 1,500 chimpanzees will die as a result of the project, either by having their habitats flooded or as a result of territorial conflicts if they try to move.\nThe ape is not the only species at risk. Scientists have recently discovered a critically endangered aquatic herb near the Koukoutamba falls.\nThe plan for the dam is popular in Guinea. But conservationists say the local population is unaware that the electricity will not be generated for them. \u201cThis is not a case of the international community putting chimpanzees before people. Three-quarters of the energy will be sold to neighbouring countries and the remaining quarter is for the mining industry,\u201d Kormos said.\nAlmost 150,000 people have signed petitions urging Guinea to halt the construction of the dam and adopt solar power, which the World Bank has offered to facilitate. If the dam goes ahead, conservationists say Sinohydro should engage with biologists to mitigate the impact.\nSinohydro did not respond to requests for comment.",

Almost half a million are on outsourced contracts, while 725,000 work directly for a public sector body.\nLola McEvoy, the head of campaigns at the Living Wage Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong [that workers are] struggling to keep their heads above water on wages that don\u2019t meet basic living costs.\u201d\nThe analysis comes after years of public sector pay freezes imposed by the Conservatives. Although Theresa May has since scrapped the policy, the prime minister is still under pressure to show austerity is at an end after nearly a decade of cuts.\nChristina McAnea, the assistant general secretary of Unison, said: \u201cHundreds of thousands of workers delivering essential public services are on poverty pay. Many have second and even third jobs just to keep the wolf from the door.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cEvery employee deserves a fair and competitive wage that recognises their hard work and contribution to our economy.\n\u201cThe government has demonstrated its commitment to workers\u2019 rights through the biggest package of workplace reforms for over 20 years, and has helped to deliver the fastest wage growth in 20 years for the lowest-paid workers through the national living wage.\u201d",

Output bound for China dropped by 72.3% compared with 2018 \u2013 the biggest fall on record \u2013 according to figures published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), an industry lobby group.\nOutput for European markets fell by one-fifth.

Michael Cohen delivers bombshell testimony \u2026 and, semi-identical twins\nThis is Alison Rourke bringing you this morning\u2019s briefing.\nThe much-heralded summit between President Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been dramatically cut short. While the leaders were in an expanded bilateral meeting, the White House said Donald Trump would give a press conference earlier than expected and it was unclear if there would be a signing ceremony. Just two hours before, Trump and Kim had held a press conference together on the second day of their talks in Vietnam. The message was there was \u201cno rush\u201d to get a deal done. The demeanour of both leaders was largely sombre even though both professed to be hopeful about future ties. Asked about the prospects for a deal, the North Korean leader said: \u201cWell, it\u2019s too early to tell, but I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m pessimistic. From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out.\u201d You can stay up to date on all the latest developments on our live blog.\n\u2018Dirty deeds\u2019 \u2013 Half a world away in Washington, Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen delivered a sharp warning to his former boss and to the Republican party that the president faces legal and political peril on multiple fronts. In an explosive seven-hour appearance before Congress, Trump\u2019s former lawyer alleged that in 2016 the president knew in advance that his eldest son, Donald Jr, was meeting Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2013 and that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from Democrats by Russian operatives. He also hinted that special counsel Robert Mueller may have proof of this.\nCohen detailed a scheme he says was cooked by by Trump, Donald Jr and the chief finance officer of the Trump Organisation, Allen Weisselberg, to pay off Stormy Daniels, the adult film actor who has alleged she had an affair with the president. Cohen said Trump knew about the scheme at every stage. Cohen said his former boss instructed him to lie about the alleged affair to Melania Trump. \u201cLying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets because she is a kind, good person,\u201d Cohen said.\nCohen hinted at further possible dangers for Trump coming from an investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, separate to Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\nIn his closing statement, Cohen spoke directly to his former boss, admonishing him for a litany of sins ranging from his attacks against the media to his policy of separating immigrant families, and his failure to \u201ctake responsibility for your own dirty deeds\u201d.\nYou can read about the key moments in Cohen\u2019s testimony here, and Richard Wolffe\u2019s take on how long Republicans are planning to \u201cprotect the unprotectable\u201d here\n\u2018Pattern of behaviour\u2019 \u2013 A top Labour official has reversed the party\u2019s decision not to suspend Derby North MP Chris Williamson, exposing deep internal party divisions over antisemitism. Williamson was filmed saying Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. He subsequently apologised and the party announced he would remain a Labour MP while a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d was examined. But internal pressure seems to have forced the change of heart. Williamson said he planned to clear his name, insisting: \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a very strong case. There is no evidence against me in reality.\u201d\nBrexit \u2013 Theresa May is expected to announce a series of new pledges on workers\u2019 rights and the easing of trade union restrictions next week, in the latest attempt to get Labour MPs to support her Brexit deal. The statement is expected to set out greater guarantees for workers post-Brexit, including a \u201cnon-regression lock\u201d and giving MPs a vote on whether to adopt future EU rules on workers\u2019 rights. Measures are also expected to include a reporting mechanism to involve trade unions and the Confederation of British Industry when the government considers such adoptions. MPs would be able to amend votes on future EU workers\u2019 rights legislation, meaning they can potentially force the government to accept new rules.\nLiving wage? \u2013 More than 1 million public sector workers are trapped in poverty, unable to make ends meet, according to the Living Wage Foundation. Their report says NHS, councils and other public sector workers receive unsustainably low wages of less than \u00a39 an hour, or \u00a310.55 in London. \u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong [that workers are] struggling to keep their heads above water on wages that don\u2019t meet basic living costs,\u201d says Lola McEvoy, head of campaigns for the foundation.\nSemi-identical twins \u2013 Researchers have been stunned by twins that are neither identical nor fraternal \u2013 but something in between. The boy and girl, now four, are only the second pair of semi-identical twins ever recorded. An ultrasound six weeks into the pregnancy suggested they were identical. \u201cWhat happened was the mother came back for her routine ultrasound some months later, and we saw one [twin] to be a boy and one to be a girl,\u201d said Dr Michael Gabbett, first author of the report from Queensland University of Technology in Australia.

Conflict grew especially acute in California in the early 1970s. As San Diego\u2019s sprawl began to push against agricultural fields, racist attacks on migrants increased. The border patrol continued being what it had been since its founding: a frontline instrument of white supremacist power. Patrollers regularly engaged in beatings, murder, torture and rape. Into the late 80s and beyond, neighbourhoods that were filled with undocumented residents had patrols operating with the latitude of an occupying army, writes Greg Grandin.\nAwareness of the violence began to break through around 2000, only to be overshadowed by 9/11 and foreign wars. In the years that followed, soldiers returning from America\u2019s foreign wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere were drawn back to the border, along with veterans of older conflicts who feared the influx of migrants. Veterans travelled to the borderlands to rehearse how lost wars could have been won and with Trump, the rhetoric against migrants took centre stage.\nMaurizio Sarri dropped Kepa Arrizabalaga, allowing Willy Caballero to finally play a part in the rolling soap opera, and the Chelsea manager was rewarded with a win that leaves Tottenham\u2019s title hopes in tatters.\nOn a busy night of Premier League football, both Liverpool and Arsenal scored five in big wins over Watford and Bournemouth respectively, Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s contentious penalty kept Manchester City on the march against West Ham and Romelu Lukaku seized his chance in Manchester United\u2019s victory at Crystal Palace.\nBeth Mead lashed home a second-half winner as England\u2019s women made a strong start to their SheBelieves Cup campaign in Philadelphia with victory over Brazil.\nEngland scored a mammoth 418 for six but were given a scare by another Chris Gayle six blitz before beating West Indies by 29 runs in the fourth ODI.\nManu Tuilagi has said his reported move to Paris to join Racing 92 is not yet a done deal and his future will not be finalised until the Six Nations is over.\nElinor Barker struck gold in the women\u2019s scratch race at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Poland and five skiers from Austria, Kazakhstan and Estonia have been arrested in anti-doping raids at the Nordic skiing world championships in the Austrian resort of Seefeld.\nUk car production fell for the eighth month in a row in January, as output bound for China plunged by more than 70%.

We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nThe letter calls for \u201cthe need to achieve full gender equality and empowerment of women across all ambits\u201d and has been signed by dozens of prominent women, including Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, Ethiopian president Sahle-Work Zewde and former Irish president Mary Robinson.\nMalcorra said that the pushback against women\u2019s rights was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d in several countries, especially in those countries where populism had led to the rise of \u201ca macho-type strongman\u201d leader, naming Brazil, the Philippines, Italy and parts of eastern Europe.\n\u201cThere is a sense of the established power being threatened by women gaining respect. It\u2019s a proposition where, if men get paternity leave for example, it\u2019s not that they lose anything, they gain by having responsibility for the family, they gain by a closer relationship with the children, that\u2019s not zero sum, that\u2019s a win-win. But it\u2019s clear that there are corners of power in the world that don\u2019t see it like that.\u201d\nThe campaign came about after Malcorra, Clark and Bokova were struck by the same urgent concern at last year\u2019s UN general assembly in New York \u2013 that the rise of populism and decline of multilateralism meant that hard-won gains in women\u2019s rights were being eroded.\n\u201cWe had a sense that there was another wave of pushback on gender equality and gender empowerment and the policies that we worked so hard to achieve,\u201d said Malcorra, who served as foreign minister from 2015 to 2017.\n\u201cWe have to be prepared to raise our concerns, otherwise we will be like the frog put into cold water which starts to warm up, and all of a sudden you find yourself in boiling water. We need to be very prepared to fight back,\u201d she said.\nMalcorra added that even in countries without strongman leaders, women should guard against thinking their rights were safe. \u201cWe are worried that we take for granted what we have. That, in our view, is our biggest weakness.\u201d\n\u201cFirst we haven\u2019t arrived to where we should be: equality in every possible field. Second, the things we have obtained, I refer to the case of abortion in the US, this is an ongoing process that has a pushback \u2026 we need to defend what we have achieved before.

        "content": "Emissions for the year to September 2018 up 0.9% as Morrison government attempts a policy pivot on climate\nEmissions in Australia are continuing to rise, with the latest increases driven predominantly by an increase in liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia.\nEmissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors.\nThe increased pollution from stationary energy reflects production growth in the mining sector, in steel and aluminium. The increase in LNG production has driven a 7.3% increase in fugitive emissions over the year to September 2018.\nTransport emissions also increased 2% over the year to September, with an 8.4% increase in diesel consumption, reflecting increased diesel passenger vehicle sales and more freight activity.\nBut emissions in Australia\u2019s electricity sector continued to fall, courtesy of a 12.3% reduction in brown coal supply, and a 14.2% increase in generation from renewable sources.\nThe latest data shows that emissions in Australia\u2019s electricity sector peaked in 2009, and have decreased almost 15% from that time.\nThe energy mix is also changing. Since 2009, coal generation has decreased from 83% of total generation to 75%, while gas has decreased from 9% to 8% and renewable generation, mostly wind and hydro, has increased from 8% to 17% of total generation.\nEmissions from agriculture also declined over the 12 months, according to the figures \u2013 a trend driven by a decreasing beef cattle population, decreases in emissions from agricultural soils and field burning of agricultural residues.\nThere was also a reduction in fertiliser use in the 2017-18 cropping year, which followed more favourable growing conditions in the previous year. Parts of the country are in the grip of a prolonged drought.\nConfirmation that emissions are continuing to rise comes in the week where the Morrison government is attempting to execute a policy pivot on climate change to try to shore up its small \u201cl\u201d liberal heartland ahead of the coming election.\nLiberals are under pressure from a number of independent candidates, many of whom are campaigning against the government because of its record of frustrating climate policy action.\nScott Morrison has this week revived Tony Abbott\u2019s emissions reduction fund, rebadged it and given it funding of $2bn over 10 years \u2013 although environmental groups and a range of climate experts say that fund has absolutely no prospect of delivering the heavy lifting on emissions reduction required to see Australia meet its Paris target.\nAs part of efforts to appeal to disaffected voters who now consider climate change a vote changing issue, Morrison has also pledged the government\u2019s support for large renewable energy projects.\nThe government has approved the Snowy 2.0 expansion, kicked in $56m for the Marinus link, and has flagged further taxpayer underwriting of the \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d proposal.\nThe government has also identified specified various components of an abatement plan which it says is consistent with Australia meeting the 2030 target.\nTo meet the target, the government intends to count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits, which is not practical emissions reduction but an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030.\nIt is also factoring in emissions reduction from the Snowy 2.0 expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy for which there are no details; the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from unspecified \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d and \u201cother sources of abatement\u201d such as projects under development but not yet contracted.\nLabor attacked the government after the release of the emissions data on Thursday. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said carbon pollution levels had been rising since the election of Tony Abbott as prime minister, \u201cand emissions will continue to rise all the way to 2030\u201d.\nButler said the rebadged emissions reduction fund would not counter the trend of rising emissions. \u201cAfter five years and $2.25bn spent, Tony Abbott\u2019s ineffective emissions reduction fund only saw pollution rise\u201d.\nThe Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the data confirmed \u201cno matter how much money Scott Morrison throws into dodgy emissions funds, pollution will keep going up until polluters are once more forced to pay for their emissions through a carbon price\u201d.\n\u201cThis latest data shows that while current investment in renewables has had some impact, it\u2019s not enough to counteract increases in emissions across most of the economy, because corporations can pollute without penalty,\u201d Bandt said.",

Yet she insisted there was no alternative.\nStatutory pay rises had led to a \u00a3100,000 budgetary black hole and she was already making \u201cdouble-figure\u201d redundancies out of a staff of 90, Hannah said. Reneging on the early Friday closure would lead to more layoffs and bigger class sizes of up to 40 children, she warned.\nFrom September, classes will finish at 12.45pm each Friday. Parents who will not be able to pick up their children early will have to pay \u00a33.50 per child to cover the costs of an after-school club.\nGovernors said they had already cut almost \u00a3400,000 from the school\u2019s budget since January 2017. Art therapy is due to stop in July, saving \u00a39,500, and support for speech and language therapy has already been reduced by \u00a316,000.\nThe school has saved a further \u00a350,000 by cutting subsidies for school trips, \u00a340,000 on support for pupils sitting their year 6 Sats exams, \u00a3100,000 on resources and \u00a3136,000 by not replacing teaching assistants when they left or retired.\nOne parent said he was troubled by the move: \u201cNot just because of the impact on the children, but on all the staff as well. This is a school that tries very hard for all of the children, so I believe them when they say that this is the least worst option.\u201d\nThe father criticised the chair of governors, who \u201ccould have demonstrated better understanding of parents\u2019 situations by not suggesting that they enjoy more leisure time with their children \u2026 Many families around here are scraping by and making do as it is, and this change absolutely will not help them or be welcomed.\u201d\nSchools in Stockport, one of Greater Manchester\u2019s wealthier boroughs, got a raw deal, said Hannah, the headteacher since 2017. Reddish is one of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but pupils there receive \u00a3650 less than their counterparts a few streets away in Manchester, she said.\n\u201cRunning a school in Stockport costs exactly the same in terms of teachers\u2019 salaries and the cost of providing a good curriculum, and yet a comparable Manchester school half a mile away would receive \u00a3350,000 more per year in basic funding,\u201d Hannah added.\nThe school insisted children\u2019s learning would not be jeopardised and timetabled teaching time would be reduced by just 20 minutes each week because the school day would be slightly extended from Monday to Thursday.\nHannah said she had received 21 emails from parents of the 550 pupils about the change. \u201cHalf were supportive and half were against. The emails against focus on the inconvenience of the closure on Fridays and the cost of childcare: even though it is reasonably priced, it\u2019s a cost that parents have got to find,\u201d she said.\nShe insisted the change was definitely happening \u201cunless there was a significant change in funding\u201d.\nAndrew Gwynne, the local Labour MP, urged the government to increase school funding: \u201cMy message to ministers is clear: don\u2019t hide behind false statistics suggesting you are protecting school budgets. This is a direct consequence of cutting the per-pupil funding in deprived communities like Reddish and the children in Reddish deserve a proper, decent, full-time education.\u201d\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said shortening the school week should be ringing alarm bells for the government.\n\u201cSchool budgets are at absolute breaking point. School leaders have made all the obvious savings \u2013 now they are faced with having to make major changes to the way they provide education,\u201d he said.\nKevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the trend of early closures in England was connected to the funding cuts many schools were facing.\n\u201cHeadteachers are having to make decisions that no one working in schools and colleges ever thought they would have to make,\u201d he said.\nThe government said it did not know how many schools had introduced half-days because they are not required to notify the Department for Education (DfE). But Hannah said she had liaised with headteachers in Calderdale, Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham and London who \u201chave all done similar or are doing so\u201d.\nA DfE spokesperson said: \u201cAny changes made to the school day need to be reasonable and parents need to be adequately consulted before changes are made, so that they can make alternative arrangements for childcare.\n\u201cWe have protected the core schools budget overall in real terms since 2010, and put an additional \u00a31.3bn into core schools funding across 2018-19 and 2019-20, over and above plans set out at the last spending review.\u201d",

MSF was earlier forced to close one of its treatment centres in Katwa, also in North Kivu province, after it was attacked on Sunday night. Assailants threw stones at the centre before setting parts of the structure on fire. The brother of a patient died while reportedly trying to escape the scene, MSF said, though the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear. Medical wards and equipment were destroyed.\nOn Tuesday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, described the outbreak as unprecedented. \u201cThere has never been an Ebola outbreak in these conditions, with such a highly mobile population and with many gaps in the health system,\u201d he said.\nEfforts to contain the outbreak have also been hampered by conflict and political instability. Suspicion and rumours \u2013 including that Ebola is not real, or that it is being used for financial gain \u2013 are also rife.\nAlready health workers lack access to affected communities, and there are fears the outbreak could spread to more volatile areas. There are concerns that the use of police escorts in the Ebola response has worsened the situation for agencies who do not employ such protection, and added to fear among communities.\n\u201cHow can you work without escorts in a place where other activities are held with escorts? Then you put yourself in an extremely difficult position, and that comes from this militarisation of the response,\u201d said Heddegem.\nThere have been 872 cases of Ebola since the start of the outbreak, according to the WHO. The source of transmission is unclear in one in five cases. Very few families are reporting signs of illness to the health workers\u2019 surveillance system, designed to identify people with the virus at an early stage.\nThe WHO has warned that there is a very high risk of the outbreak spreading not only across DRC but to Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\nThe agency is calling for $148m (\u00a3111m) for agencies to continue the response. So far, less than $10m has been pledged.",

The Roc was seeking to determine whether the money had been spent in line with union rules.\nUnder cross-examination from the AWU\u2019s lawyer, Herman Borenstein, Enright told the court on Thursday that Cash was on a \u201cpolitical side of parliament\u201d that would \u201cclearly\u201d have had an agenda.\n\u201cWhat was in her mind exactly I don\u2019t know \u2026 I assumed she had an agenda, if I can put it that way,\u201d Enright said.\nBut he said people who made referrals to regulators \u201cinvariably \u2026 have some preferred outcome or have their own agenda\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon skilled investigators to be alive to that,\u201d he said.\nHe also said he knew the decision to investigation the allegations would be damaging to Shorten if made public.\nAsked he if had acted to support Cash\u2019s \u201cpolitical purpose\u201d, Enright replied: \u201cI entirely reject that proposition.\u201d\nClaiming the investigation was politically motivated, the union cited the letters from Cash and claimed that her staff leaked news of the raids to the media after a tipoff from a Roc media adviser.

MPs would be able to amend votes on future EU workers\u2019 rights legislation, meaning they can potentially force the government to accept new rules.\nUnions, including Unite, were expected to be consulted in the final stages of preparing the statement, though the TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, has been publicly sceptical about the guarantees.\nIt is unclear whether the final package of measures will be offered as a separate bill, which some Labour MPs have demanded, or as part of the EU withdrawal bill, which other Labour MPs prefer because they believe it would be harder to unpick.\nLabour MPs who support the new measures are unsure how many more colleagues will be won over by them. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more people\u2019s minds this is going to shift,\u201d one said.\nA Downing Street source said the timing of the announcement had not been finalised, though it would be before the meaningful vote. The prime minister may hold the vote next week, before the 12 March deadline, depending on when the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is able to reach an agreement with Brussels.\nIn her statement to the Commons on Tuesday, May promised to give parliament a vote on whether it wished to follow EU standards in areas such as workers\u2019 rights and health and safety. She also pledged that the government would consult with businesses and trade unions when it looked at new EU legislation.\nThe prime minister promised to give the commitments force in UK law, without specifying the form this would take.\nMay has been talking to a small group of Labour MPs who have been pushing for the guarantees, including the former minister Caroline Flint and the backbenchers John Mann and Gareth Snell.\nSnell robustly defended the group\u2019s actions in an exchange during the Brexit debate, saying: \u201cI have spoken to the prime minister about workers\u2019 rights, funding for our towns post-Brexit, and what we need to do to find a way through this. Some of my colleagues have labelled those things as bribes, but they are wrong; what we are trying to do is find a constructive way forward.\u201d\nJames Brokenshire, the communities secretary, is expected to announced a \u00a31.6bn Brexit fund, spread over seven years, for towns and coastal communities. Government sources said they hoped it would be announced before the next meaningful vote.\nThe fund was intended for 26 of the 38 \u201clocal enterprise partnerships\u201d and none of it would go to London. Regions such as the Black Country, Greater Manchester and other Midlands regions, for example, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, were likely to get the most significant funding, according to the Sun.\nMay confirmed at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday that there would be a fund to \u201censure our towns can grow and prosper\u201d, but declined to give further details.",

The attention of a jaded public and neophiliac media may have been aroused by #MeToo, with its connotations of youth, sex and celebrity, but for the most part it has drifted recently towards other forms of prejudice, such as transphobia. Unfortunately for women, though, the hoary old problems of discrimination, violence and unpaid labour are still very much with us. We mistake our fatigue about feminism for the exhaustion of patriarchy. A recent large survey revealed that more than two thirds of men in Britain believe that women now enjoy equal opportunities. When the writer and activist Caroline Criado Perez campaigned to have a female historical figure on the back of sterling banknotes, one man responded: \u201cBut women are everywhere now!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a smart strategy, therefore, to invite readers to view this timeworn topic through the revealing lens of data, bringing to light the hidden places where inequality still resides. Criado Perez has assembled a cornucopia of statistics \u2013 from how blind auditions have increased the proportion of female players hired by orchestras to nearly 50%, to the good reasons why women take up to 2.3 times as long as men to use the toilet. This is a man\u2019s world, we learn, because those who built it didn\u2019t take gender differences into account. Most offices, we learn, are five degrees too cold for women, because the formula to determine their temperature was developed in the 1960s based on the metabolic resting rate of a 40-year-old, 70kg man; women\u2019s metabolisms are slower. Women in Britain are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack: heart failure trials generally use male participants. Cars are designed around the body of \u201cReference Man\u201d, so although men are more likely to crash, women involved in collisions are nearly 50% more likely to be seriously hurt.\nGender-blindness in tech culture produces what Criado Perez calls the \u201cone-size-fits-men\u201d approach. The average smartphone \u2013 5.5 inches long \u2013 is too big for most women\u2019s hands, and it doesn\u2019t often fit in our pockets. Speech-recognition software is trained on recordings of male voices: Google\u2019s version is 70% more likely to understand men. One woman reported that her car\u2019s voice-command system only listened to her husband, even when he was sitting in the passenger seat. Women are more likely to feel sick while wearing a VR headset. Another study found that fitness monitors underestimate steps during housework by up to 74%, and users complain that they don\u2019t count steps taken while pushing a pram.\nEven snow-ploughing, it turns out, is a feminist issue: in Sweden, roads were once cleared before pavements, a policy derived from data that prioritised commuters in cars over pedestrians ferrying children or doing the shopping. But then officials realised that it\u2019s easier to drive through three inches of snow than push a buggy through it. Clearing pavements first also saved the state money: a study in one Swedish town found that pedestrians were three times more likely to be injured in icy conditions than car drivers; and 70% of those injured were women.\nThe sheer abundance of examples in this book militates somewhat against its argument, which is that there is a lack of gender-specific data: a \u201cgender data gap\u201d. Googling \u201cgender impact assessment\u201d yields upwards of 345m results. Criado Perez to some extent acknowledges this tension, imploring planners and politicians to make better use of the data that already exists, but that\u2019s less an issue of data than of policy and design.\nThe neat thing about data is that it avoids thorny questions of intention. Criado Perez doesn\u2019t set out to prove a vast conspiracy; she simply wields data like a laser, slicing cleanly through the fog of unconscious and unthinking preferences. Unless we crunch the numbers and take positive steps to correct bias, she argues, inequality will automatically continue. Technology is associated with innovation, but algorithms tend to reinforce the status quo: \u201cIf you like that, you\u2019ll love this.\u201d\nData not only describes the world, it is increasingly being used to shape it. The first programmers were women \u2013 the human \u201ccomputers\u201d who performed complex calculations for the military during the second world war. Now women make up just 11% of software developers, 25% of Silicon Valley employees, and 7% of partners at venture capital firms. Bytes may be neutral, but programmers are often \u2013 wittingly or unwittingly \u2013 biased.\nGiven the growing power of those algorithms, I wanted to find more about what Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2013 the myriad ways in which the \u201cinternet of things\u201d and social media are selling our private lives to advertisers. The data predicting and moulding our behaviour is granular enough to know the percentage of cashmere in the sweater I bought online last year in a weak moment, and it certainly knows I\u2019m female. The problem with this kind of micro-profiling is not its gender data gap but its ruthless commercialisation of everyday life \u2013 although women, under constant pressure to be Instagram-ready and fashion-forward, are arguably its disproportionate victims. By calling out persistent unfairness in a world that \u2013 for all the talk of technological \u201cdisruption\u201d \u2013 seems to have given up on the idea of human progress, this book ends up treading more familiar ground than the data theme may initially suggest. Campaigning may rely on saying the same thing over and \u2013 wearyingly \u2013 over again. For this, our stubbornly sexist society, not its doughty critic, is to blame.\n Eliane Glaser\u2019s Anti-Politics: On the Demonization of Ideology, Authority and the State is published by Repeater.

Just avoid the acorns\nAfter playing Trials Rising\u2019s first few tracks, which send you careening wildly down huge ramps, backflipping through the air and revving enthusiastically on an agile motorbike, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this was a high-thrills racing game. In fact, it\u2019s as much a puzzle game as a racer, requiring careful, precise control of the throttle, your rider\u2019s weight and your own temper to bunny-hop through tricksy obstacle courses without flipping the bike over or touching an explosive barrel.\nIt is an adrenaline-heavy experience either way, whether you\u2019re zipping through an easy course or wrestling the bike around a tougher one with your heart in your mouth. It can be intensely frustrating, but even if you never develop total mastery of motocross physics, it\u2019s still great fun.\nThe courses send you riding across the world from snowy Sweden to picturesque China, providing beautiful backdrops to your two-wheeled antics. These tracks are unpredictable and ever-changing, with explosions or electric fences or, once, an alien invasion livening up the racing.\nOn PS4, Xbox and PC, Trials Rising looks breathtaking, but on Switch it is unfortunately unimpressive \u2013 fog and dust disguise the vistas, and drops in frame rate make precise racing difficult. The vertiginous views are a significant component of Trials\u2019 thrill, so Switch players are missing out.\nOff the track, annoying loot boxes, progress screens and a pointless avalanche of uninspiring clothes and bike parts to customise your rider get in the way of smooth progress through the tracks. There are so many confusing currencies \u2013 experience, gears, acorns (?) \u2013 that I ended up ignoring the lot of them. On the bike, though, Trials Rising is close to flawless, a demanding, absorbing and occasionally rage-inducing game that will serve you up an exciting challenge for as long as you can take it.",

        "content": "Robin wants to find a way to create a site that doesn\u2019t require coding experience\nAs chair of our local allotment association, I\u2019m wondering about setting up a website to provide information and news to new and existing allotmenteers. Can this be done with basic tech knowledge and zero experience of web design or coding? There\u2019s a bewildering number of services offering to host websites, sell domain names, provide easy-to-use templates and so on at a range of prices. What are the catches with the free or cheap services on offer?\nWe have a Facebook group but nobody in the association is very keen to keep this active. Robin\nIt\u2019s a pity you don\u2019t like the idea of using Facebook because this is generally the quickest and easiest way for a small group to get online. In fact, if an organisation has a physical manifestation \u2013 a school, park or church, allotments, a restaurant or so on \u2013 then it may already have a Facebook page. If so, you can apply to take it over. If that fails, you can start your own page and compete with it.\nUsing Facebook has advantages: it\u2019s free, you don\u2019t need to do any programming and it\u2019s likely most of your users will already have accounts. Facebook pages are also easily accessible to members\u2019 spouses, children and relatives who wouldn\u2019t visit a website.\nFacebook groups are different from Facebook pages. Facebook groups are more like chatrooms, and you can keep them private if you like. You could use a Facebook page for news and a private Facebook group to publish minutes and debate issues, among other things.\nWhen the web took off back in the 1990s, it was like the opening of America\u2019s midwest, and millions of people went \u201cdigital homesteading\u201d on sites such as GeoCities. Building websites with HTML turned out to require more effort, and more taste, than most people possessed. There were lots of good sites but most were dire.\nIn the early 2000s, homesteading was replaced by blogging, which didn\u2019t require any programming skills. Templates removed the need for design skills, or even taste. Although the basic diary structure of a blog didn\u2019t suit every purpose, the free WordPress software made most things possible, for those who were willing to make the effort \u2026 or pay someone to put their website together.\nAfter the blogging boom, we saw the rise of the drag-and-drop website builder, which is where we are today. Drag-and-drop systems let you build websites quickly and easily by plonking pre-written components onto your developing webpage, with no programming required.\nIf you\u2019re rejecting Facebook, it comes down to a choice between WordPress and a drag-and-drop system. If you think you might be willing to give WordPress a go, read one of the dozens of online guides, such as How to Start a WordPress Blog the Right Way in 7 Easy Steps (2019). There\u2019s a companion half-hour YouTube video.\nThere are more than a dozen drag-and-drop website builders, and they all work in pretty much the same way with modules you just drop into place. They make it reasonably easy to update your website or transform it just by switching to a different template.\nMany drag-and-drop website builders come with some sort of hosting arrangement and a website address, so you don\u2019t need to take out a domain name in advance. Of course, many domain name sellers and hosting providers use drag-and-drop website builders to attract people to buy domain names and sign up for web hosting packages. GoDaddy is a well-known example.\nSites built with drag-and-drop website builders should now be \u201cmobile friendly\u201d, adapting to work on smartphones not just in PC web browsers. This is something to check.\nBut there are some drawbacks. The main one is that drag-and-drop websites can be very hard to customise, and you mess with template code at your peril. Second, not every website builder will have all the options you need, so, without expensive customisation, it may be impossible to do what you want. Third, your website may look exactly like hundreds of other websites, and some people will instantly spot common templates. This might not bother you but it looks bad on a commercial website.\nFourth, your website may be locked to the fortunes of the drag-and-drop software supplier or web host. You\u2019re at their mercy if they have technical problems, if response times drop, or your traffic explodes. You might not be able to move your website to a host with a different website builder and end up having to rebuild the whole thing from scratch.\nNot all web hosting services come with unlimited bandwidth, and the free limit could be as low as 2GB. Find out what the limit is, and what happens if you exceed it.\nA local site might not expect to get more than a few hundred visits per month, and if your page is small \u2013 500,000 or less \u2013 then you probably won\u2019t have to worry about bandwidth charges. However, there\u2019s always the risk of something going viral. A post with a photo of a cute kid with a puppy, or whatever, shared on social media, could get thousands or even millions of hits.\nIt\u2019s better to have your website go offline when it reaches a bandwidth limit than be faced with a huge bill.\nThree independent drag-and-drop website builders currently stand out from the crowd \u2013 Wix, Weebly and Squarespace \u2013 and there are lots of comparison reviews online.\nAll three allow you to create a free test site so you can find out how well they work, and both Wix and Weebly will let you publish it. The main drawbacks are that you can\u2019t use your own domain name, and that they will put their advert on your site. There may be storage and bandwidth limitations as well.\nWix and Weebly are happy to host free personal sites because the failures cost nothing and the successful users will eventually move up to a paid plan. Squarespace doesn\u2019t want free users: it targets commercial users, from creative freelancers and small businesses to large organisations.\nWix\u2019s paid plans start at \u00a33 per month with 500MB of storage and 1GB of bandwidth, but the \u201cbest buy\u201d offers 10GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth for \u00a38.50 a month. The latter includes a free domain name for the first year.\nWeebly is cheaper. Its \u00a33 a month deal includes 500GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth and a domain name. It also has a Starter offering with unlimited storage for personal use for \u00a35 a month, and a Pro service for \u201cgroups and organisations\u201d for \u00a38 a month. (These prices are for payments made annually.)\nSquarespace is a more polished operation with offices in New York, Portland and Dublin. It also has the best designs. All its plans have unlimited storage and bandwidth plus a domain name. Personal websites cost \u00a310 a month when billed annually (\u00a313 a month if not) and business websites cost \u00a315 a month when billed annually (\u00a321 a month if not). It also has a cut-price deal for students.\nYou should try all three to see which you like best, but I suspect you won\u2019t want to pay Squarespace\u2019s prices. Otherwise, a free Weebly account \u2013 which has unlimited bandwidth \u2013 looks like the best bet, if all your content fits into 500MB.\nHave you got a question?

We\u2019ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we\u2019re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.\nLucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at: \n  weneedtotalkabout@guardian.co.uk\n\u2026 providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.\nThe fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth \u00a332 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, \u201coutstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications\u201d. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as individuals, play in improving this growing issue?\nThe UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013\u2019s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.\nIn addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled \u2013 it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, \u00a3140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.\nThe Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore \u2018ethical\u2019 designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world\u2019s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.\nOther prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of \u2018eating\u2019 plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?\nWe look forward to hearing from you!",

Enjoy might not be the first thing that springs to mind, but it might be time to get onboard as, over the past year or so, adding a handful of mushrooms to your hot drink, chocolate or energy bar has become an increasingly normal thing for people to do.\nReishi, boletus, cordyceps and lion\u2019s mane sound less like mushrooms and more like things you reluctantly take as a last ditch attempt to clear up a patch of eczema \u2013 and, indeed, high claims have been made for their supposed health benefits. Most sellers talk up their products\u2019 antibacterial, antiviral and immune-enhancing properties, but don\u2019t go so big on the fact that, say, cordyceps are parasitic fungi that grow on insects (mmmm, is that my stomach rumbling?).\nSo, does parasitic fungi grown on insects taste nice when dropped into an espresso? Fans online have described mushroom coffee as tasting somewhere between tea and coffee (which sounds like the kind of thing you get from the Guardian\u2019s office drinks machine no matter what you order), so I headed to Planet Organic in north London for one of its Superfood coffees, a combo of reishi, maca, espresso and hazelnut mylk. The barista describes them as a popular choice: \u201cNot world famous, but they have a \u2026 cult following.\u201d As if by magic, the person queuing behind me steps up to order a mushroom coffee. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not even being paid by the Guardian to do it,\u201d I think to myself.\nThe drink tastes surprisingly non-weird: there is a slightly unusual bitter finish, but it doesn\u2019t exactly scream: \u201cOi, you\u2019ve got mushrooms in your drink, you weirdo.\u201d\nThis lack of mushroomness turns out to be a regular occurrence in the world of shroom food. For instance, you probably wouldn\u2019t detect any mushroom in Pollen and Grace\u2019s hazelnut, praline and reishi Super Square unless you had been forewarned \u2013 maybe not even then. The variety of mushroom chocolates I test also taste overwhelmingly funghi-free: Hifas da Terra\u2019s agaricus blazei chocolate tastes like slightly dusty dark chocolate, whereas its chocolate, marron glace and boletus is nothing more alarming than \u201cpleasantly nutty\u201d. Only its chocolate blend of cordyceps sinensis and pollen feels suitably earthy \u2013 enjoyable for me as a lover of both mushrooms and weirdness, but arguably less so for my colleagues, whom I caught screwing their faces in disgust as they sampled it. After a week of mushroom eating, the only thing I can find that tastes definitively of mushrooms are Other Food\u2019s slightly more traditional oyster and shiitake chips \u2013 whole mushrooms crisped up and marketed as a healthy alternative to crisps.\nNone of these products come cheap, it should be noted. The chocolate bars could set you back \u00a36 to \u00a38 for a 100g bar, while even the bag of crisps pushes \u00a33. Is it worth it? That really depends how much you believe the health-benefits spiel. To me, the shroom craze appears to be just the latest stage in the wellness era, where increasingly strange-sounding powders and potions are disguised in your drink in return for a hefty price tag. It might make sense to save your cash for making a fancy risotto instead.",

The phrase reverberates from nurseries to nursing homes, and hushed conversations once held out of the earshot of children and polite company are giving way to a more open dialogue about psychological wellbeing. But are we seeing the full picture? And does the vogue for wellbeing distract us from a long-overdue conversation about individuals with serious mental illness?\nI work as a consultant psychiatrist in assertive outreach, a specialty that aims to help those who have struggled to engage with psychiatric services. While they too have mental health problems, you don\u2019t hear a lot about some of the people I meet.\nHarry is in his late 60s. We met many years ago at the local asylum before it finally shut. Now in the community, he lives in a surreal world in which he is at various times a forensic psychiatrist, an archbishop and a member of the royal family. He moves nomadically, trying to escape clandestine government agencies intent on silencing him with some kind of laser beam.\nHis poor mental and physical health isn\u2019t helped by his squalid surroundings or a lifetime of chain-smoking and heavy drinking. Too paranoid to venture out, he relies on us to reach his local shop. Occasionally he comes into hospital but his admissions are brief and don\u2019t achieve much. He\u2019s had a couple of heart attacks but, fearing euthanasia, he won\u2019t see his GP. So we monitor his physical health and try to extend the much-reduced life expectancy that he, as someone with a severe mental illness, can otherwise expect.\nVinny was previously diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He has also spent much of his life locked away, in his case in forensic psychiatric facilities. It\u2019s true that he\u2019s been violent but only when very ill, suffering from what is undoubtedly a bipolar illness and not schizophrenia at all.\nTwo decades ago he tried in vain to seek help from psychiatric services but, since that time, years of sectioning involving the police, forced injections and secure care \u2013 in his view all brutally imposed by racist institutions \u2013 have bred a deep mistrust of the system. Out of hospital at last, he is one of many black men currently subject to a community treatment order. He is nine times more likely to be subject to such an order than a white counterpart, which is just one of the striking racial disparities in mental healthcare.\nLeanne is in her 30s, and has three children who were all taken into care. Her own childhood was marred by horrific abuse, which left her with deep emotional and physical scars. She hears voices and has visions that are waking nightmares.\nDespite imagined tormentors that sometimes command her to kill me, she accepts me as her doctor, yet mistrusts the psychiatric services she feels have spurned her. She\u2019s tried to kill herself many times, and doesn\u2019t feel lucky to be alive. I fear her next attempt will be her last. She is detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act. I hope she is not destined, like so many others, to end up warehoused out of sight and out of mind in a locked psychiatric facility many miles from home.\nThese people\u2019s faces don\u2019t fit the glossy anti-stigma campaign posters. Mindfulness apps are not their bag any more than workplace massages, and they have experienced no nirvana from mindful skiing or cold water swimming. It\u2019s good that self-help strategies work for many, but we must be realistic about their effectiveness for those with profound psychosis. The celebrity narratives about mental health that inspire so many fail to resonate with them: those experiences don\u2019t mirror the crushing poverty caused by benefit reform, the homelessness exacerbated by the decimation of supported accommodation, or the exclusion from the digital revolution which is leaving the most vulnerable stranded in its wake.\nThe recently announced NHS long-term plan talks of new models of mental health care for those with severe mental illnesses and interventions including psychological therapies, physical healthcare, employment support, trauma-informed care, medicines management, and support for self-harm and substance use. As a frontline clinician I remain cynical: the harsh reality is that, for this group of patients, services designed specifically to meet their needs have been axed across the country in favour of short-term crisis-driven interventions. My plea is that as policymakers strive to deliver on the NHS long-term plan, they give serious mental illness as much prominence as promoting positive mental health \u2013 and that they spare a thought for those whose voices are so seldom heard.\nHarry, Vinny and Leanne are pseudonyms for an amalgam of the author\u2019s experiences of patient care\nDr Nuwan Dissanayaka is consultant psychiatrist at Leeds and York partnership NHS foundation trust\nIf you would like to contribute to our Blood, sweat and tears series about experiences in healthcare, read our guidelines and get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

She can be heard on CCTV screaming in pain and saying: \u201cI\u2019m not faking, I\u2019m not faking. Please take the cuffs off me, I\u2019m not faking.\u201d\nAt one point a police officer says \u201cyou have got to be joking\u201d when Duncan is unable to stand up. Later, another officer jokes upon hearing her moan in pain, \u201cis she having an orgasm?\u201d\nThe police auxiliary officer, identified only by a surname in the CCC report, can be heard telling Duncan: \u201cYou need to tone your story back a little bit because that\u2019s really what\u2019s giving you away \u2026 just a future tip.\u201d\nLater she says: \u201cIf you weren\u2019t carrying on like a child you would actually be bailed out the door ... Is your daughter embarrassed of you? ... Because I\u2019d be embarrassed of you, too.\u201d\nThe report said Duncan\u2019s \u201cfrequent complaints of pain were met with scorn\u201d.\nIn response to the report, the West Australian Police Union president, Harry Arnott, criticised the \u201cwholesale and relatively indiscriminate targeting and charging\u201d of police with disciplinary offences.\n\u201cSuch an approach might be convenient to the WA Police Force because it allows them to represent to the world that it has addressed the issue, but it completely overlooks the systemic failures that greatly contributed to this incident,\u201d Arnott said.\nThe failures he mentioned were the fit-out of the station and the use of the holding area as a lock-up, when it is not equipped as such.\nThe union has reported the station to Worksafe. Disciplinary proceedings are ongoing.",

He also managed to squeeze a fold-up chair and some water through a gap.\nAfter about 30 minutes, Hockney and the others, who told jokes to keep spirits up, were released.\nHockney \u2013 cigarette in hand and desperate for a smoke \u2013 cheerfully posed for photographs with his rescuers afterwards. He also asked for a cup of tea.\nCould you make this up? Stuck in a lift in Amsterdam with David Hockney. Rescued by firemen, thanks to the editor of the Daily Mail. Very strange ,but true.\nThe artist was in the Netherlands for the opening of a new show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam exploring the parallels between himself and the Dutch painter.\nBefore getting stuck in the lift Hockney had spoken about his passion for Van Gogh and the next chapter in his life beginning this weekend, which will be in France.\nHis enthusiasm was infectious. \u201cI\u2019m just going to Normandy because we\u2019ve got a house there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is surrounded by trees, it is going to be marvellous for me because I\u2019ve got a new location and I\u2019ll draw it. I can\u2019t think of anything better in life than watching the spring happen in Normandy in 2019, I mean what better thing can I do? I can\u2019t think of anything. Van Gogh would love it.\u201d\nHockney returned to his adopted home city of Los Angeles after several years painting the Yorkshire Wolds. Asked if he might return to paint Britain, he was dismissive. \u201cI\u2019ve no plans. Not at the moment. I think France is a lot more smoker-friendly \u2026 I take that into consideration as well.\u201d\nThe artist said he was taking his inspiration from the Bayeux tapestry. He hopes to create a moving picture where the viewer does the moving. \u201cIf I paint it right, you will walk past it down a kind of corridor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is better to see it that way\u2026 if you think about it, the arrival of spring is too slow for a movie.\u201d\nThe new Hockney show, which opens to the public on Saturday, explores how Van Gogh influenced Hockney, and how they share an artistic attitude, a similar way of looking.\nHockney recalled being 16 years old in 1954, studying at Bradford art school and travelling by bus to see the Van Gogh show in Manchester. He was struck by the vibrancy of colour and how much paint was being used.\n\u201cI thought, he\u2019s quite a rich artist because he could use two whole tubes of blue to paint the sky. Not even the teachers at the art school could afford that.\n\u201cIt was the colour I remember. I had never seen paintings like that before really. Real ones, not looking in a book,\u201d Hockney said. \u201cAt the art school everyone just painted grey pictures and black Bradford. There was not much colour at all. At first I probably thought he had exaggerated colour and now I don\u2019t at all.\u201d\nVan Gogh had a way of looking which offered all of us lessons, he said. \u201cHe could see space very clearly. He hated photography. I\u2019m a bit similar actually \u2013 you must look at the world. Van Gogh is telling us that there is a marvellous world in your own back garden, you\u2019ve just to look at it, really look, I think that\u2019s his message.\n\u201cIt\u2019s thrilling if you really look, the world is beautiful actually, it is, but you have to really look at it.\u201d\nThe Amsterdam show includes paintings from Hockney\u2019s time in the north of England, including the colossal The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire in 2011 which is 9.75 metres wide and was gifted by the artist to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. There are also sketchbooks, iPad drawings, videos and what Hockney calls photographic drawings.\n Hockney \u2013 Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature at Amsterdam\u2019s Van Gogh Museum from 1 March to 26 May 2019",

The closure of the Bulwer Island refinery in Queensland in 2014 completed the trifecta and saw Australia\u2019s refinery capacity almost halve in just three years.\nThe Department of Environment and Energy\u2019s latest report on fuel stocks, released in December, shows that on current consumption levels, Australia had 23 days of jet fuel supply, 22 days of diesel and 18 days of automobile fuel in reserve.\nThe department did not count \u201con water\u201d barrels \u2013 fuel stock which is on its way to Australia \u2013 as part of the reserve, given supply issues which could arise in the event of conflict.\nShorten said not enough had been done to address warnings about Australia\u2019s lack of fuel stocks.\n\u201c\u2026If the fuel stopped coming, within 20 days, we would just grind to a halt \u2013 this is an important issue, not just for our economic independence, but fuel security is important for our national security,\u201d he said in Perth.\n\u201cWe want to, in the next 10 years, start building tank farms to make sure that we increase our reserves \u2026 We also want to start researching alternative fuels so we become less dependent on oil coming from other parts of the world.\u201d\nThe resources minister, Matt Canavan, claimed the plan sounded \u201clike a thought bubble\u201d which lacked costings and questioned whether Labor planned to place a levy on petrol prices to pay for the new operation.\nBut Shorten said the cost of doing nothing would be far higher. \u201cThe reality is, we became a net importer of oil in 2012 and nothing has happened,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you want to start creating long-term fuel security for this nation, it has to start now. You are not going to remedy the problem overnight \u2013 it has taken us years to get to the position we are in. And what I am proposing to do is to start tackling the issue. I am putting fuel security as a national issue, a national political issue. It is not a partisan issue.\n\u201c\u2026 What Labor is doing is putting forward a proposition that says we should have a fuel security corporation and if the government says it costs too much, all I say to the government is this, \u2018wait until we run out of fuel, that will cost a lot\u2019.\u201d\nThe loss of Australia\u2019s refineries earlier in this decade has also led to a loss of storage tanks and now sees Australia export three-quarters of its crude oil production, with a 2013 report prepared for motoring body NRMA predicting the nation could be 100% reliant on imported fuel stock by 2030.\nThe government launched its own investigation into the nation\u2019s fuel security under Malcolm Turnbull last year.\nThe energy minister said the outcome of that review would be released \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d.",

He\u2019ll apparently have \u00a3200m at his disposal to mould a team in his image and first in, if he gets his way, will be the quicksilver Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson. The Mill smells a Jamie Vardy replacement \u2013 although smelling salts may be required to cope with a fee north of \u00a340m. West Ham and Chelsea might have their own ideas, too.\nCould Brendan also take his relationship with Celtic\u2019s fans to the next level by returning for a few of their favourites? Kieran Tierney, Callum McGregor and James Forrest are believed to be among those for whom treble winning might spark less of a thrill than the Battle For Seventh.\nThat\u2019s the biggest wad of cash on the table; it\u2019s as if there was the inconvenience of some actual football during this midweek. But Real Madrid never quite sleep, now even while they\u2019re banging them in at the Nou Camp. They\u2019re dreaming and scheming about signing a new left-back now that Marcelo, not entirely in favour these days, seems to have been lined up for a summer move to Juventus.

The Spanish champions might even be back for more \u2014 they like the look of Andr\u00e9 Onana, the Eredivisie club\u2019s prodigious Cameroonian goalkeeper, but Tottenham, Arsenal and West Ham are ready to join them in the chase.\nSomebody will sign a very good striker in RB Leipzig\u2019s Bundesliga hotshot Timo Werner this summer. If only there were a club in that division that specialised in mopping up its rivals\u2019 biggest stars \u2026 oh hi, Bayern Munich, who have reportedly beaten the likes of Liverpool, PSG, Barcelona and Real Madrid to ensure Werner spearheads a slightly labouring attack from next season onwards.\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\nAnother German-based striking sensation, Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s 21-year-old Luka Jovi\u0107, is currently the top-flight\u2019s leading scorer and will almost certainly move on come the season\u2019s end. Barcelona and Chelsea have both been linked but Manchester City are the latest big hitters to show an interest in the Serbia international.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer might have another hot young prospect to deal with at Manchester United. They\u2019ve taken Zito Luvumbo, a 17-year-old winger who impressed for Angola at the Cosafa youth tournaments last year, on trial. The New Manucho, as they aren\u2019t yet calling him throughout the Stretford End, also has admirers in the dapper forms of Watford, Porto and Sporting Lisbon.",

        "content": "Ahead of Vegas showpiece, Eagles coach discusses diversity, psychology and why his team has made four finals in a row\nIn the HSBC World Rugby Men\u2019s Sevens Series, the USA have reached four finals in a row. Going into their home event in Las Vegas this weekend, which they won for the first time last year, they are level with New Zealand at the top of the rankings.\nSuch success is unprecedented and it is the result, says Mike Friday, of \u201ca lot of hard work\u201d. Any coach might be expected to say so but the affable Englishman, once a Wasps scrum-half and coach of England and Kenya, is a professor of the shortened game. There\u2019s more to it.\n\u201cAmerica is such a diverse place,\u201d he tell the Guardian, over the phone. \u201cCertainly within our squad we represent that diversity. And while that diversity can be your biggest strength it can also be an achilles heel, when it comes to communication, perceptions and understanding, the possibility of misunderstanding the way that people may be or are.\n\u201cObviously we\u2019ve worked hard on our physical, tactical and technical development, they\u2019re givens. But we undertook a large piece of work off-pitch probably 10 months ago, working on communication and awareness of others and self-awareness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how you need to be prepared to compromise and comfort and mediate both with what you say and what others say, and to work hard on having that flexibility in communication.\u201d\nIn short, Friday\u2019s players come from various walks of American life, from the coasts, from north and south and in between, and they come from different social, educational, even political backgrounds. And they have learned to live and work together.\nIn a country riven by partisan bitterness, it\u2019s a thought-provoking point. It\u2019s also a point made to someone who edits political news by day, and therefore cannot resist suggesting Republicans and Democrats might learn something by watching the sevens on ESPN. Friday laughs at the notion of Donald Trump in a scrumcap, bound on to Bernie Sanders. Then he neatly sidesteps the trap.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had teething problems,\u201d he says, \u201cdon\u2019t get me wrong. Like all brothers or families, you have good days and bad days. But we\u2019ve come out the other side.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a squad that are able to communicate efficiently and effectively under pressure, and also at times when they\u2019re not under pressure or when they have historically not liked to communicate, perhaps. They now choose to accept one another and support one another.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really psychology: it\u2019s just growing as men. It\u2019s taken time but we\u2019re seeing the benefits now.\u201d\nLast July, the Eagles had a disappointing World Cup in San Francisco, finishing sixth. But in this World Series they have reached finals in Dubai, Cape Town, Hamilton and Sydney. They have beaten Fiji, New Zealand, England and Australia. But they lost all four finals: two to Fiji, the Olympic champions, two to New Zealand, champions of the world.\nFriday admits to regrets and a determination to end that painful run. But \u201cthe reality is we\u2019re all about Olympic qualification this year and to get that we have to finish in the top four. To break the stranglehold of the super powers, that is the challenge.\u201d\nAfter a successful debut at Rio 2016, sevens will be back for Tokyo 2020. Last time the USA men qualified regionally, beating Canada, but the Games did not bring glory. This time it looks like the run-up, at least, might be somewhat smoother.\nSomewhat. Sevens is a breathless rush and as Friday says, \u201cit comes down to moments. Some are in your control. Some are not.\u201d\nIn the final in Sydney this month, the Eagles made 27 offloads in one attack, drawing two penalties from the equally relentless New Zealand defenders. It was extraordinary stuff but then, as Friday describes it, sevens worked its horrible magic.\n\u201cWe ran this tap play, we tried a wrap-around and their player tackled Danny Barrett into Folau Niua. The ball bobbles clear, Folau is on the floor and replaced on an HIA [head injury assessment] and New Zealand run away and suddenly it\u2019s 14-0.\n\u201cThe game wasn\u2019t won and lost there but the momentum shifted. The ebb and flow of sevens happened. And of course that\u2019s why we love the game. You\u2019ve got to see it for what it is.\u201d\nWhat sevens is, he says with another laugh, is \u201cGladiator\u201d: a brutal arena spectacle. As such it\u2019s well made for Vegas, which has hosted since 2010, organisers United World Sports putting on the international event alongside tournaments for schools, colleges and clubs.\nPerhaps surprisingly, World Rugby is looking to take the USA Sevens elsewhere. But for now, Sin City it is. Last year, for the first time, the Americans won the jackpot. They will try to repeat but they will do so without Perry Baker, world player of the year two years in a row, scorer of a phenomenal try against Fiji last year. He broke his jaw on a Tongan head in Hamilton and, Friday says, is likely to miss Vegas, Vancouver, Hong Kong and Singapore before returning for London and Paris.\nIn his absence the likes of Kevon Williams, a product of small-college rugby at New Mexico Highlands University, will have another chance to shine alongside Danny Barrett, Ben Pinkelman, Madison Hughes and Stephen Tomasin, world-class players all. Friday speaks glowingly of Williams and others in the squad for Vegas, among them Maceo Brown, Marcus Tupuola and Ben Broselle.\n\u201cOur challenge over the next 18 months,\u201d the coach says, \u201cis to identify and nurture a squad that can push us through to 2020. And as a tier-two rugby nation in a tier-one economy, that\u2019s tough.\u201d\nIn the richest country in the world, sevens offers the chance to win Olympic gold, not to make a pile of silver. In 2017, Rugby Today reported that the \u201chighest-paid contracted sevens Eagle\u201d made just $24,000 a year.\n\u201cIt requires a lot of sacrifice to chase that dream,\u201d Friday says. \u201cThese boys live on the poverty line, on the minimum wage. That\u2019s the reality of this. It\u2019s on a par with probably stacking shelves in Walmart.\n\u201cThey do it because they love it and want to create role models. America is trying to play catch-up. Once you create the role models and capture imaginations, of the population and most importantly the commercial world, then you get a shot.\u201d\nIn Vegas, in front of \u201cthe passion, emotion and positivity the American supporters provide, the full-on razzmatazz\u201d, Friday expects his team to thrive.\n\u201cThey get to play in front of their families, and that\u2019s massive. When we won last year that was the most pleasing thing for me. The families have to sacrifice as well. Just to see them share that win and enjoy it makes up for it all a little bit.\n\u201cSo no we don\u2019t feel the pressure at home, we enjoy the positivity. If anything we just have to be careful about the distractions of Vegas. Everybody wants a piece of us. We want to be in there with the USA Rugby community, it\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\u201cBut we are there for business.\u201d",

So there is a risk that fatigue with the subject of the European Union will reduce our appetite for Robert Menasse\u2019s 2017 German-language bestseller \u2013 a satirical novel about the workings of the multinational Brussels bureaucracy \u2013 which is timed to appear in English just ahead of the UK\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU.\nBut if the enervating news coverage does depress the book\u2019s prospects, it would be cruelly unfair to Menasse, a 64-year-old Austrian whose work spans novels, poetry and political theory. The Capital delivers, within a brilliant satirical fiction, thoughtful and instructive analysis of both the weaknesses in the EU that galvanise leavers and the strengths that motivate remainers.\nMenasse dramatises a EU which, due to the rise of Eurosceptic nationalism in many member nations, is \u201cthreatening to break apart\u201d, with the further complication, for future planning, that \u201cBritain wasout of the game, even though she was still hanging around the pitch.\u201d In the hope of improving public opinion, the European Commission, the EU\u2019s governing body, plans a \u201cspecial project\u201d to mark the 50th anniversary of its foundation. Martin Susman, an Austrian who serves on the EC\u2019s culture and education directorate, comes up with an idea, based on the organisation\u2019s founding aim of ensuring Auschwitz is never forgotten or repeated. Through metres of emails and weeks of meetings, Susman negotiates with colleagues including Fenia Xenopoulou, a Greek in the culture directorate, and superiors such as Kai-Uwe Frigge, a German commissioner of trade, who is a master of the EU art of helping himself while hindering rivals.\nThe only Brit is, with a structural realism that also makes a mordant point, a very minor figure. George Morland, intended to be Britain\u2019s last commissioner to the EU, is a pink-faced Johnsonian (Boris, sadly, not Samuel) show-off toff, whose aim is to trash the room before his nation goes. A Pole with two names, an Austrian professor and an elderly German resident of a rest home also play roles that are clarified only gradually, as the political life of Brussels overlaps with the broader story of a murder at a city hotel. Inspector Brunfaut, a cop with knowing nods to Maigret, investigates a case that nods to Belgian cultural hero Magritte: surreally, a key lead is a pig that witnesses keep reporting at large in the city.\nPorkers become the book\u2019s governing metaphor. Even the most dedicated European single-marketer may warm to World Trade Organisation terms after Menasse\u2019s bravura account of the long-running \u201csow wars\u201d between the EU\u2019s agriculture and trade divisions. The agricultural wing wishes to reduce pig production, in order to stabilise falling European pork prices, while the farming arm seeks to substantially increase the sow count to meet growing Chinese demand for pork products. When this impasse hardens after an intervention from the health and safety directorate over veterinary standards, the member EU states insist on negotiating separately with China, leading to a global price slump.\nIn another bureaucratic paradox, an EU conference delegate notes that \u201cfrom the opening of their session there had been consensus that Europe\u2019s crisis could be solved only with those very methods that brought it on in the first place.\u201d This phrasing recalls Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch-22, and The Capital, in scope and tone, suggests a fusion of Heller\u2019s war comedy with his other masterpiece, Something Happened, a dark comedy of office life.\nMenasse sardonically details the tactics of EU politicians, such as the advantage that a chair can gain from conducting a meeting in one of the weaker languages of the most troublesome participants. Long-serving commissioners warn newcomers of the vital importance of ceasing to read the media from your home country; to flourish in Brussels, you must become pan-national.\nYet, beneath this farcical power-playing, the novel reflects and respects the roots of the EU as an attempt, led by France and Germany, to insure against a repetition of the continent\u2019s conflicts and genocides. The Belgian detective\u2019s father was a resistance fighter; a war cemetery is a recurrent location; and a crucial subplot involves a challenge to the EC\u2019s ranks of statisticians to establish exactly how many concentration camp survivors remain alive. Ridiculous as the Brussels jawing may be, it is explicitly balanced against the former warring.\nLacking German, I can\u2019t assess the accuracy of Jamie Bulloch\u2019s translation, but the English prose has a panache and clarity rare in exported literature. The jaunty playing with words \u2013 such as the compound \u201cconscience-nonsense\u201d,a mix-up over the words \u201cstatist\u201d and \u201cstatistician\u201d, and a pun involving \u201csanctum\u201d and \u201csanctimony\u201d \u2013 are fittingly reminiscent of that most Eurocentric of recent British novelists, Anthony Burgess. Bulloch also trusts readers to grasp, or at least intuit, untranslated French, German, Czech and Flemish.\nReaders may understandably feel that a novel about the EU is the last thing they need just now; but if so they will miss a first-class read.\n The Capital by Robert Menasse, translated by Jamie Bulloch, is published by MacLehose (RRP \u00a315).

        "content": "As Black History Month comes to an end, African American golfers discuss how much progress the sport has made \nThis month at the PGA Genesis Open, four black Americans \u2013 Tiger Woods, Cameron Champ, Harold Varner III, and Tim O\u2019Neal \u2013 were in the 144-strong field. It marked the highest number of black American golfers to play in a PGA tour event but it was still far from representative of the demographics of the United States. As Black History Month ends, the Guardian spoke with three black golfers to discuss the progress the sport has made and, more importantly, what it needs to do to continue growing the participation and inclusion of African Americans.\nCheyenne Woods, LPGA Tour player: Every weekend I would be in front of the TV watching Tiger Woods with my golf club in hand. I distinctly remember going to a junior event thinking I had a great idea of wearing black and red, only to find out every other junior golfer thought the same. Tiger was \u201ccool\u201d, and he made golf \u201ccool\u201d to go out and play.\nHarold Varner III, PGA Tour player: I loved that you could do it by yourself. It\u2019s not like other sports where you need someone else to be there to compete against, or you need someone throwing the ball to you. With golf, it\u2019s just you and the course.\nMackenzie Mack, professional golfer and LPGA certified instructor: I don\u2019t run very fast and don\u2019t jump very high so golf was a game that I could play and be successful. And golf was a game we played as a family. So trying to beat my sister, Sydnee, who was also a Division 1 scholarship golfer was always fun.\nCW: No. Growing up, I loved the fact I was usually the only girl in school or only black person at tournaments. I enjoyed the feeling of being different. I have had so many instances over the years of proudly telling people I play golf. I can\u2019t count the amount of times I am then replied to with: \u201cWow, you don\u2019t look like a golfer\u201d. I\u2019ve continued to grow my love of breaking the mold of what a \u201cgolfer\u201d has been.\nHV: No, none whatsoever. I didn\u2019t really think about it until I got on the PGA Tour when I was asked about it, and people made me aware of it. But my parents were really supportive, and tried to give me all the opportunity possible to play. I did play in some Bill Dickey tournaments when I was younger, and that was an eye-opener because it was the first time I played with another black kid in a tournament. I remember thinking, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d But we also had Tiger Woods, who was dominating at the time, and not only did people of color look up to him, so did white golfers.\nMM: I grew up in an urban junior golf program called Valley View Golf in Las Vegas whose goal was to get minorities involved in the game golf. So, I grew up with other minority golfers at my local facility but when I traveled outside of my local facility, my sister and I were often the only minorities we saw. The lack of diversity never discouraged me from playing the game though because I loved it so much.\nCW: I have 100% seen golf evolve since I started playing in the mid-90s. I\u2019ve seen the game become more global, more athletic, and more effort put towards increasing diversity. But in order to help continue the evolution of golf, we need to support programs that give communities affordable access to increase the inclusivity of the game. The issue I\u2019ve always seen with golf is that it is not the easiest sport to have access to, and it can be an intimidating environment. Even at a young age, my mom and I did not know about driving ranges so we\u2019d simply go to the neighborhood park and hit balls around in a field. Programs that share not only share knowledge of the sport, but also give access, are crucial. I believe it\u2019s important to not limit these programs to just junior golf. Inclusivity programs should include a range of ages, careers and ethnicities.\nHV: It\u2019s ridiculous how expensive golf is and it\u2019s hurting the game. I just don\u2019t see a lot of mini golf courses where they have the same kind of programs that I had when I was growing up, and I think in order for golf to reach more people, we need more programs like that.\nMM: I am a testament to how the game has slowly evolved over time. It is an honor to be the fourth African American woman to hold dual membership in the PGA and LPGA. I hope to inspire the next generation to play the game as the ladies before me, did for me.\nCW: The only challenge I\u2019ve found in the lack of diversity in golf, is the weight and responsibility to be one of few representatives of African Americans in golf. Diversity has been an ongoing topic in the sport, however there is still so much room to grow and improve. I hope to continue encouraging the message that golf is not defined by the stereotype it has historically gained.\nHV: I\u2019ve never had trouble playing, or had issues playing on a course, or anything like that. I\u2019ve certainly heard stories of older golfers who were denied access, or never got the opportunity to play, but I never had to deal with any type of discrimination on the course.\nCW: One program in particular that played a huge part in my junior golf career was the Desert Mashies, founded by Bill Dickey in Phoenix. It is connected with the Bill Dickey Scholarship Association and Bill Dickey Invitation which almost every single black golfer currently on tour has been a part of. It is a unique environment of bringing together the best minority golfers in the country and allowing them to connect and compete. It also creates college scholarship opportunities to those wanting to play at the next level.\nHV: I started a foundation called HV3, and we\u2019ll be hosting our first tournament on 23 March. It\u2019s to help kids get exposure and access to golf, because not many kids can go to a golf course and just play golf, and we want to change that.\nMM: I have seen golf move in the right direction over the years with initiatives and efforts from The First Tee, PGA, LPGA, We Are Golf, Bill Dickey, Women in Golf Foundation, Fore Life and many many more. But there is still a long way to go.",

Asked by his interrogator to say more, he replied: \u201cI am sorry, sir, that\u2019s all I\u2019m supposed to tell you.\u201d\nDelhi said it \u201cstrongly objected to Pakistan\u2019s vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian air force in violation of all norms of international humanitarian law\u201d.\nThe external affairs ministry said it had summoned the acting high commissioner of Pakistan, Syed Haider Shah, and lodged a strong protest at the violation of the Indian air space by Pakistan and the targeting of Indian military posts.\nIndia earlier said one of its air force Mig-21 fighter aircraft has been \u201clost\u201d in an engagement with Pakistani aircraft in the Indian portion of Kashmir and that its pilot was missing. Pakistan earlier said it shot down two Indian planes and captured two pilots, but later retracted that claim.\nBy Wednesday evening, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had yet to comment publicly on the fighting but was meeting military chiefs at his residence in Delhi.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, appealed for talks, making reference to both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals.\nKhan said in a televised address after the airstrikes that the time had come for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. \u201cWith the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation? Shouldn\u2019t we think that if this escalates, what will it lead to?\u201d\nThe dogfights on Wednesday morning were the first between the two air forces to be publicly acknowledged since 1971, and triggered the closure of every commercial airport in Pakistan and at least eight in India. Pakistan also closed its airspace, forcing international flights to be rerouted.\nFootage of the captured pilot, including one video showing him being beaten by a crowd of angry civilians, made the rounds of WhatsApp and social media in India, fuelling popular concern and anger. The pilot said in a video released later by the Pakistani military that its soldiers had \u201crescued me from the mob\u201d, and he was shown sipping tea.\nThere is only one pilot under Pakistan Army\u2019s custody. Wing Comd Abhi Nandan is being treated as per norms of military ethics. pic.twitter.com/8IQ5BPhLj2\nSrinagar, the Indian-controlled capital of the Kashmir region that both countries claim in full, appeared to be preparing for war. Its army headquarters observed a blackout overnight as Indian jets patrolled over the city. On Wednesday afternoon, a red cross was painted on the roof of its largest hospital, marking out the building as a medical facility from above.\nIn supermarkets in the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Islamabad, people were stockpiling groceries, while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province the leave of all police and health workers was cancelled.\nRussia, the US and the UK were among the countries calling for restraint amid fears that the region was trapped in a cycle of escalating attacks.\nA Pakistan-based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in a suicide bombing in Kashmir two weeks ago. Indian jets bombed what they claimed were militant training camps in Pakistan on Tuesday morning in response, triggering Wednesday\u2019s reprisal by Pakistan.\nKhan said the latest airstrikes were deployed from inside Pakistan-held territory and deliberately aimed at empty fields to send a message. \u201cIt was our plan that there should be no collateral damage, no casualties,\u201d he said in his televised address.\n\u201cWe just wanted to tell India that we have the capability that if you can come into our country, then we can also go into your country and carry out an operation.\u201d\nBut India rejected his account of the operation. \u201c[Pakistan] used its air force to target a military installation on the Indian side,\u201d the spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry, Raveesh Kumar, told journalists in Delhi.\nIslamabad initially said it had captured two Indian pilots, but by Wednesday evening it had retracted the claim. Delhi also claimed to have shot down a Pakistani jet, which it said had crashed on the Pakistani side of the border.\nThe US has played a mediating role in previous escalations of conflict between the neighbours, but on Wednesday Pakistan\u2019s ambassador in Washington said the Trump administration\u2019s failure to condemn the Indian airstrike had contributed to the tension.\nAsad Majeed Khan said the US response was \u201cconstrued and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position \u2013 and that is what emboldened them even more\u201d.\nThe standoff between the two countries is heightened by India\u2019s looming national elections starting in April. For Pakistan, the driving need is to show its more powerful neighbour that it cannot be pushed around.\nArun Sahgal, a retired Indian army brigadier turned policy analyst, said he believed both countries would walk back from the brink. \u201cThe events of today indicate a satisfied Pakistani appetite for retaliation,\u201d the Delhi Policy Group senior fellow said.\n\u201cBoth countries have lost an aircraft each so there is a degree of equivalence. And from a political perspective, the Indian prime minister [Narendra Modi] has come out looking like a decisive leader. So there is nothing more to achieve.\u201d\nBut the mechanics of drawing down the conflict were another issue and fraught with their own risks, Sahgal said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the international community must play some backchannel diplomacy that pushes the two sides together.\u201d\nNandan, the first Indian fighter pilot captured by Pakistan since a 1999 war between the countries, said in the video released by the Pakistani military that he was being treated well.\nThe British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he was involved in a round-the-clock effort to prevent the crisis from deepening.\nHe said: \u201cNeither side wants this to escalate. But because of the historic lack of trust between the two countries, it\u2019s a very volatile situation. You don\u2019t have just the governments, but you have public opinion in both countries that is very inflamed. We are urging [both Pakistan and India] to show restraint to stop this situation from deteriorating.\u201d",

        "content": "The champions may need to grind out more results as they did against West Ham if they are to retain the title\nManchester City may have to play more of the bump-and-grind football that got them over the line against West Ham on Wednesday if they are to defend their Premier League title successfully. They hogged the ball but lacked edge in front of goal until Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 59th-minute penalty secured all three points. At half-time West Ham were holding City 0-0 and the memory rewound to Pep Guardiola\u2019s pre-game declaration. Before the 11-game title run-in the manager said he wanted no excuses from his players \u2013 no citing fatigue or adjustments to the XI \u2013 if desire to defend their crown fell low.\nGuardiola tested the second part of his stance by changing nearly half the side from Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final, though with players such as Danilo, Riyad Mahrez, Leroy San\u00e9, Vincent Kompany and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan drafted in he would have been confident of doing so with little or no dip in quality. The manager\u2019s faith looked well-placed when Mahrez ghosted into the area early on, though his attempt lacked poise. He had said he would state afterwards whether City had met his demands and he described the performance as \u201cvery good\u201d.\nAfter seven minutes West Ham might have been 4-0 down, David Silva going closest in hitting the post. Passes were being pinballed between Kevin De Bruyne, Kompany, Oleksandr Zinchenko, David Silva and G\u00fcndogan in a relentless rhythm that left West Ham chasing shadows.\nThough City had not scored, the sense was that, if one goalcame, several more could follow. Yet as the half-hour approached with the game still scoreless Guardiola showed the first signs of agitation. First he indicated to the bench that a ball should have gone long rather than short down the left. Then he was visibly disgruntled to see Mahrez caught offside. De Bruyne was next to leave the Catalan nonplussed when he hit a pass straight to Felipe Anderson, the visiting No 8. De Bruyne found his man \u2013 Mahrez \u2013 when next in possession and, although the shot was saved by Lukasz Fabianski, it did draw applause from the manager.\nBefore the match Guardiola fielded a question about whether he believed Liverpool were stuttering after three draws in their last four league outings. By half-time J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men were cruising at 2-0 up over Watford and City were level, with Guardiola the frustrated one of the two managers.\nIt was his team who were slightly out of sync and appearing creaky. Sunday\u2019s triumph took 120 minutes plus a shootout. Guardiola may not want to countenance tiredness but City also remain in contention for the Champions League and the FA Cup as they chase what De Bruyne terms the \u201cimpossible\u201d dream of a quadruple, and that is bound to drain energy.The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\nMoments before the interval West Ham put together a sequence of passes that moved them from defence to attack and did to City what they love doing: pulling teams all over the pitch. The travelling support serenaded their side and Guardiola looked bemused. The latter emotion was heightened when De Bruyne\u2019s touch deserted him and what should have been a delicate ball to Mahrez was smashed straight out.\nWorse was to follow early in the second half as West Ham came close to taking the lead, Ederson\u2019s acrobatics keeping out an Andy Carroll effort. Now, though, City\u2019s depth of quality started to be felt.\nOn came Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva in quick succession and suddenly the latter was the filling in a Ben Johnson-Anderson sandwich. The referee, Stuart Attwell, awarded the penalty and Ag\u00fcero stroked it home.\nCity deserved the advantage and in taking hold of the match Guardiola\u2019s demand that he \u201csmell\u201d the will to get up for this last phase of the championship race was met. Their last 10 games are Bournemouth (away), Watford (home), Fulham (a), Cardiff City (h), Crystal Palace (a), Tottenham Hotspur (h), Manchester United, Burnley (both away), Leicester City (h) and Brighton & Hove Albion (a).\nTwo fixtures stand out \u2013 the back-to-back meetings with Spurs and United \u2013 but City will be wary of every team. Guardiola believes there will be more twists and turns and that City and Liverpool will both drop points.\nSince losing 2-1 at Newcastle at the end of January the champions have won four league games on the bounce. They have done so with champagne football \u2013 6-0 and 3-1 over Chelsea and Arsenal at home \u2013 alongside the more rudimentary performance that did for the returning Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team.\nCity wound down the clock near a corner flag, a rare sight from a team whose head coach espouses positive, front-foot play. They may need more of the bump-and-grind stuff to eke out results like this before they end their campaign.",

        "content": "The NRA currently faces a bevy of political, regulatory and financial headaches, say gun analysts and NRA veterans\nAfter the National Rifle Association spent a record $30m plus to help elect Donald Trump president it had high hopes for its gun rights agenda, but Trump\u2019s victory has been a mixed blessing, with the NRA currently facing a bevy of political, regulatory and financial headaches, say gun analysts and NRA veterans.\nThe problems for the 5 million member NRA range from an emboldened pro-gun control Democrat-controlled House to state and federal regulatory fights, and from better financed groups seeking to curb gun deaths to internal criticism of NRA leadership.\nGun issue lobbyists, both pro and con, and firearms experts say the group\u2019s legendary clout is being challenged on multiple fronts and its longstanding image of invulnerability and power is encountering tougher opposition.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very serious confluence of issues that the NRA is facing,\u201d said Richard Feldman the president of the Independent Firearm Owners Association, and a longtime NRA member. \u201cThey\u2019re facing a growing storm.\u201d\nRobert Spitzer, the author of five books on guns and a politics professor at Cortland SUNY, added: \u201cThe NRA is facing some pretty hard times these days with a heavy legal, political and financial cloud over them.\u201d\n\u201cTheir reputation has suffered in the public mind \u2013 especially in the outrage cycle following Parkland,\u201d the Florida school where last February 17 people died in a mass shooting.\nIn the year since Parkland there were almost 350 mass shootings including one this month at an Illinois factory where an employee with a criminal record owned an illegal gun that killed five people. Overall, the death toll from such mass shootings has been rising for almost two decades.\nWhich helps explain why the NRA\u2019s big stable of lobbyists and lawyers is \u2013 yet again \u2013 battling new gun control measures in Congress and state legislatures, plus regulatory legal skirmishes.\nOne key example: a bipartisan bill to expand background checks to include almost all gun purchases was approved this month by the House judiciary committee, the first such action since the 1990s. The bill was passed by the full House this Wednesday.\nBut NRA allies predict that with the Senate remaining in GOP hands, the odds are that gun owners have \u201clittle to worry about gun control legislation in the current Congress\u201d, Feldman of the independent gun owners said.\nBut that may not be the end of the story.\n\u201cTheir eyes need to stay peeled to what happens after the 2020 elections,\u2019\u2019 if Democrats take back the Senate and the White House where Trump has not always been as solid an ally as the NRA hoped, Feldman said.\nMany gun rights champions were dismayed when the administration last December banned bump stocks, the devices that can modify semi-automatic weapons to make them more lethal and which were used by the Las Vegas shooter in October 2017 who killed 59 people.\nThat ban didn\u2019t sit well with NRA activists given the group\u2019s 2016 record spending to help Trump with TV and digital ad blitzes, which made the NRA his biggest outside ally, and provided badly needed early ad support in summer 2016.\nTrump did show his gratitude in early 2017 when he became the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to attend an NRA convention where he offered his full support. \u201cI will never let you down,\u201d he told the NRA faithful in Atlanta.\nBut on the financial front, the Trump presidency has contributed to leaner times for the NRA than hoped: revenues in the last two years declined, contributing to a notable drop in NRA political spending in the 2018 midterms.\nNRA spending on the 2018 elections totaled $9.4m, roughly a third of the $27.0m it poured into the 2014 midterms, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA was even outspent by pro-gun control groups, a seismic shift that was fueled in part by millions of dollars from billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and gun control backer behind Everytown for Gun Safety.\nNRA loyalists note that when the Republicans control the White House and Congress fundraising and membership revenues often drop. NRA revenues from membership dues fell since 2016 from $163m to $128m, according to CRP.\n\u201cThe membership becomes complacent because there\u2019s less a threat to the second amendment,\u201d said a former NRA employee adding that he expects fundraising \u201cwill take off\u201d with Democrats pushing for more gun control.\nBut Spitzer said a key lesson of the 2018 elections was that candidates \u2013 including some Republicans \u2013 could advocate tougher gun control and \u201cnot only not be penalized, but ride those issues to victory\u201d.\nThe NRA\u2019s other political and regulatory troubles at the federal and state levels became palpable last year too.\nLast December two watchdog groups filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging the NRA illegally coordinated a $25m television ad campaign in 2016 with the Trump campaign, enabling them to \u201cadvance a unified, coordinated election strategy\u201d.\nElection law bars independent political groups like the NRA from coordinating their ad efforts with candidate campaign committees.\nThe complaint by the Campaign Legal Center and the Giffords Law Center to prevent Gun Violence charges that the NRA and the Trump campaign used the same four executives at two firms located at the same address to buy their ads.\nThe FEC permits outside groups and campaigns to use the same vendor, but they must create \u201cChinese walls\u201d between their clients to prevent coordination.\nThe NRA denies there was any coordination.\n\u201cThe NRA complies with all election laws and any suggestion to the contrary is false\u201d said Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman.\nLast May, the NRA suffered a different regulatory blow when a fledgling gun insurance program, dubbed Carry Guard, was banned by New York state regulators who ruled it \u201cunlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for certain acts of intentional wrongdoing\u201d.\nThe NRA website has touted Carry Guard insurance as a way \u201cto avoid and de-escalate conflict situations\u201d and boasted that Carry Guard provides \u201cimportant access to financial resources\u201d, if someone is charged with a criminal act.\nBut the New York department of financial services ruled that the NRA did not obtain a proper state license. The insurance brokerage that sold Carry Guard terminated its New York policies and agreed to pay the state $7m in penalties.\nThe New York regulatory action prompted the NRA last summer to sue the state, a move that has turned into a costly and lengthy legal battle for the NRA which argues that if New York succeeds the NRA may be \u201cunable to exist\u201d.\nLikewise, Washington state also banned Carry Guard and levied about $175,000 in fines against two insurers that sold it.\nSeparately, the NRA has faced some internal criticism from longtime members who fault the leadership for not pushing hard for less gun control \u2013 such as a bill that would have expanded nationwide concealed carry gun privileges \u2013 before the last elections.\n\u201cThey squandered a golden opportunity to enact some pro-gun reforms,\u201d , said Feldman.",

It will become more complicated. When we are out of the EU the passport arrangements will change, so artists coming from wherever will get into Europe but worry they then won\u2019t be able to cross the Channel.\u201d\nWhile he noted their concerns may be unfounded because it was too early for artists to make official visa applications, he said there was a feeling this year of people asking: \u201cCan we be bothered? Is this a process we want to put ourselves through?\u201d\nSmith, speaking as the festival launched a 2019 programme including Ziggy Marley and Orbital, said that audiences had also expressed their concerns about the issue and had asked how performers could be made to feel more welcome.\n\u201cSome artists are saying they might not bother applying [for a visa]. My programme manager is in regular dialogue, offering them reassurance, [but] recent events have not made that easier,\u201d he said.\nSmith described the fear that artists would overstay their visas as \u201carrogance\u201d, because they were successful artists. \u201cWhy would they want to stay?\u201d\nWomad (World of Music, Arts and Dance) was founded by the musician Peter Gabriel in 1982. This year\u2019s UK festival will take place from 25\u201328 July at Charlton Park in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.\nLast year Gabriel expressed his \u201calarm\u201d at UK foreign policy after a number of international artists were unable to perform at Womad due to visa issues.\nGabriel said: \u201cIt is alarming that our UK festival would now have real problems bringing artists into this country \u2026 [many of whom] no longer want to come to the UK because of the difficulty, cost and delays with visas, along with the new fear that they will not be welcomed.\u201d",

The Alpine Meadow, a scrubby slope for most of the year, is carpeted with snowdrops, fritillaries, daffodils and crocuses from February to April. There are beds of gorgeous cyclamen and hellebore currently in bloom and the well-stocked Victorian glasshouses are a delight at any time of the year. In May, the 111-year-old wisteria adds to the attractions. There\u2019s also a small cafe and museum. \n Free entry, car park \u00a32.50, visitleevalley.org.ukEmma\nAs St David\u2019s Day approaches, what better way to celebrate the arrival of spring than by being surrounded by thousands of that most optimistic of flowers, and national emblem of Wales, the daffodil? In the sheltered eight acres of wooded valley that form part of Colby Woodland Walk in Pembrokeshire, you\u2019ll not only find banks of cheerful golden trumpets but also drifts of snowdrops, dotted with jewel-like purple crocuses. Hard to imagine that this was once a coal-mining area; nature has reclaimed it, painting it in vibrant spring colours.\n Adult \u00a38.40, child \u00a34.20, nationaltrust.org.ukClare\nEnter the cream garden gates of Dunham Massey at this time of year and you are swathed in the sweet scent of flowering shrub daphne Jacqueline Postill. As my sight is getting worse, I particularly appreciate these fragrant shrubs, plus winter honeysuckle and sweet box. There is much else to enjoy: a classic group of white birches gleaming against the black leaf litter and a neighbouring copse of the delicate multi-stemmed variety; shy clumps of tiny magenta cyclamen; an avenue of sulphur yellow witch hazels; and sunlit dogwoods, bare stems glowing salmon, ruby and lime. \n Adult \u00a311, child \u00a36.50, nationaltrust.org.ukHelen Brazier\n Guardian Travel readers' tips\nEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Snowdrop season is enchanting but, as well as these intriguing little beauties, there are aconites, anemones, irises, daffodils, crocus, hellebores, primroses and fragrant shrubs bursting into hopeful bloom. It\u2019s a family-friendly place, with a lost elf village, snowdrop tours, yummy veggie and vegan food in the cafe, plant sales and cute new-born piglets.\n Adult \u00a35.50, under-16s free, cambogardens.org.ukRebecca\nWilliam Wordsworth was warden at St Mary\u2019s Church church in Rydal and when his daughter Dora died of TB at the age of 42 in 1847 he and his wife planted hundreds of daffodils as a memorial to her. The Wordsworths\u2019 had bought the land to build on in 1826 because they were concerned they would lose their tenancy at neighbouring Rydal Mount. Not just the beauty and tranquillity of the garden appeals but the view from it overlooking Windermere.Walter\nMany Cambridge colleges lie with their rears facing the River Cam, creating wooded meadows called the Backs. In February the area is carpeted with purple crocuses. As you pass along the path towards the flowers, view King\u2019s College Chapel and Trinity\u2019s Wren Library across the Cam. Walk or cycle from Cambridge railway station towards Silver Street, cross the Cam and then follow the hoggin (gravel and sand) path north and parallel to the river for about 500 metres. The densest flowering is behind Trinity College, west of North Paddock.John Hall\nWhen it comes to early spring it\u2019s hard to top these gardens and walks near Chiddingfold in the Surrey Hills. The natural woodland feel and layout means every walk feels like a discovery instead of a meticulously planned garden. The visitors\u2019 map we received on entry helped in our spotting of camellias, magnolias and azaleas and helped us identify the many rare flowering shrubs. There are plenty of spots to sit and take in the views and it\u2019s also wonderful for photography as the garden\u2019s lakes and pools add amazing reflections. And, very importantly, there\u2019s a tearoom.\n Opens on 16 March, adult \u00a37.50, under-16s free, ramsterevents.comStan\nThis garden between Rugby and Kettering is among my favourite places to visit in spring. It has a woodland area where white narcissus grow alongside anemones and violas. In the orchards I am quite jealous of the spring-flowering shrubs. The camellias, magnolias and viburnums all look so healthy. There is an on-site plant nursery but maybe I could employ the Coton Manor gardeners to spruce up my garden. Well worth a visit.Adults \u00a37, child \u00a33, cotonmanor.co.uk Candice\nEach spring wild crocuses carpet this meadow seven miles south-east of Newbury. A delight to view and a joy to visit \u2013 for free. One legend has it that 12th-century crusaders brought them back from central Europe. Others believe that they are garden escapees that have established themselves over the past 200 years. Alongside the crocuses you may find wild orchids, oxeye daisies and vivid mauve and purple scabious and knapweed. \n bbowt.org.ukJ Messenger\nSnowdrop Valley puts on a marvellous show each spring. The woodland and dells surrounding the River Anvil play host to hundreds of thousands of delicate snowdrops. The estate is privately owned but opens for about a month each year to share just how beautiful it is. This year it is open until 3 March. There are five walks of varying difficulty to take: we chose walk two, which takes about an hour-and-a-half and consists of bridle paths and footpaths, largely through woodland.

        "content": "New law will allow people of Toledo to act as legal guardians for Lake Erie, and polluters could be sued to pay for cleanup costs\nWhen they first started talking about doing something about the algae blooms in Lake Erie, which had made the once pristine water green and slimy and unhealthy from agricultural phosphorous runoff, people in Toledo, Ohio didn\u2019t really know what to do. \u201cSometimes it was almost like all of us were at a funeral and we felt we had just seen the lake die,\u201d said Tish O\u2019Dell, a community organizer who specializes in environmental issues.\nBut this week, more than four years after the devastating algae bloom in 2014 that cut off drinking water for 500,000 people, Toledo voters passed the Lake Erie Bill of Rights, a unique charter amendment that establishes the huge lake as a person and grants it the legal rights that a human being or corporation would have.\nThe final results weren\u2019t even close, as it passed by a 61% to 39% margin.\nNow the \u201crights of nature\u201d movement is already spreading from the midwest to the rest of the US. Organizers behind the vote say they have heard from representatives of communities in Silicon Valley, counties around Salt Lake City in Utah, citizens of states surrounding the Chesapeake Bay and cities along the Atlantic coast in Maine.\n\u201cWe had representatives from Florida who came up here to work on our campaign because they want to see what they can do about the recent big algae blooms in the Gulf of Mexico they have suffered from,\u201d said Markie Miller, a local Toledo theater manager and one of the organizers for getting the bill on the ballot.\nThere have been a few countries that have granted rights to designated forests and river watersheds \u2013 Ecuador, New Zealand, India and Colombia \u2013 but these have mostly involved claims by indigenous peoples who feel their rights have been violated by excessive timber logging or road construction along rivers, not environmental problems in the US rust belt.\nNor have any of them been as large as the Lake Erie river watershed, which encompasses 30,000 sq miles of land in both the US and Canada. That\u2019s one reason why the Lake Erie \u201cpersonhood\u201d movement is so different from the others.\nThe new law will allow the people of Toledo to act as legal guardians for Lake Erie \u2013 as if the citizens were the parents and the lake were their child \u2013 and polluters of the lake could be sued to pay for cleanup costs and prevention programs. It is one of the first of its kind in the US, as it grants human rights to a body of water that is 10,000 sq miles in size, provides drinking water for 11 million people and has four states and two countries along its 870 miles of shoreline.\n\u201cIt was definitely a long, hard struggle \u2026 but all the hard work and countless volunteer hours by everyone in our local community group has paid off,\u201d said Crystal Jankowski, a Toledoans for Safe Water organizer.\nDespite its overwhelming passage, the ballot initiative caused much consternation in Ohio. A radio campaign paid by opponents of the Lake Erie bill said it was being pushed by \u201cout-of-state extremists\u201d.\nMany in the business and agricultural community think \u201cthat its passage means Ohio farmers, taxpayers and businesses now face the prospect of costly legal bills\u201d, and that the measure would \u201clikely be found unconstitutional and unenforceable\u201d, according to a statement by the Ohio Farm Bureau this week.\n\u201cTo be quite frank about this, the reaction of the farmer and business lobbyists and some politicians who had opposed this bill makes me think that they have had long enough time to show results in getting the lake clean from their efforts,\u201d said Bryan Twitchell, a Toledo school teacher who worked on getting the bill on the ballot.\n\u201cWe found out we were better off standing up for our interests in this and we can do a better job of running this lake cleanup ourselves,\u201d he said.\nTwitchell said with the election won, now might be a time for rest, but is very cautionary about that attitude. \u201cWe know the next part of this process will be having to put our hopes in the hands of lawyers.\u201d\nHe is right about that. Yesterday morning, just 12 hours after the final votes had been counted, the first lawsuit was filed in the US district court in Toledo by the owners of a farm that grows corn, soybeans, wheat and alfalfa 40 miles south-east of Toledo. The lawsuit contends that the Lake Erie Bill of Rights measure is unconstitutional and unlawful and will put the fifth-generation family farm at risk.",

        "content": "England have joined the global chorus of disapproval at the latest plans to reform rugby union\u2019s international calendar. A leaked proposal to create a new 12-team World League from 2020 which excludes the Pacific Islands for economic reasons is causing uproar in both hemispheres, with Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union\u2019s acting chief executive, criticising the concept as \u201cunder-cooked\u201d.\nWith leading players including Johnny Sexton, Owen Farrell and the All Blacks captain, Kieran Read, having already voiced deep reservations about changes to the existing Test schedule, Melville has made clear the RFU also has significant concerns on a number of grounds, not least player welfare.\n\u201cWe have seen a presentation from World Rugby on a potential global competition,\u201d said Melville, who will remain in day-to-day charge at Twickenham until the union\u2019s new permanent chief executive, Bill Sweeney, arrives from the British Olympic Association. \u201cHaving seen that presentation we asked lots of questions. Our main priority is player welfare. Travel, the rising intensity of the games, more back-to-back Tests \u2026 the players will be concerned about all these things and what would happen in a Lions year doesn\u2019t seem to have been addressed either.\u201d\nThe latest proposals leaked to the NZ Herald newspaper would see the Six Nations and Rugby Championship sides form a league with the addition of USA and Japan. The teams would play each other once during the year, culminating in semi-finals and a final in the northern hemisphere in early December but, crucially, there is no promotion and relegation component attached. This would exclude developing European nations such as Romania, Georgia and Russia, as well as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, prompting fears it could signal the death of top-level 15-a-side rugby in the Pacific Islands.\nThere are suggestions a broadcaster has tabled a bid and that the plan could be signed off shortly. Melville, speaking in Exeter where England will play their Women\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy next Saturday, says the RFU is seeking further clarification.\n\u201cWe understand the globalisation of sport but we don\u2019t understand how this competition works. For me it\u2019s under-cooked at the moment. We\u2019ve asked the questions everyone else has probably been asking and we\u2019ve yet to get answers. We\u2019ve got to be very careful. You need to get the competition right first and then say: \u2018How do we commercialise this?\u2019\u201d\nWorld Rugby has insisted in a statement that nothing has yet been finalised and that \u201cassumptions made in the statement regarding the proposed competition structure are inaccurate\u201d. Almost 40 international players held a conference call this week, however, and have serious doubts about player workload, increased long-haul travel and a lack of opportunities for tier-two nations. Sexton, the president of the International Rugby Players, said: \u201cWhile players gave this idea a cautious welcome when we met at the end of last year it now seems like a commercial deal on the future of the game is being negotiated at a rapid pace with little consideration given to the important points we raised with World Rugby in November.\u201d\nRead\u2019s view is the standard of Test rugby would suffer if the proposal goes ahead. \u201cFans want to see meaningful games; they don\u2019t want to see fatigued players playing a reduced quality of rugby as part of a money-driven, weakened competition that doesn\u2019t work for the players or clubs,\u201d said the New Zealand captain. England\u2019s captain, Owen Farrell, has similar reservations. \u201cPlayers are definitely open to discussing a new global season, but what we develop has to work with the club game in order to reduce conflict, deal with player release issues and make sure their welfare is looked after. The proposal presented to us doesn\u2019t seem to have considered this properly.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s scrum-half Ben Youngs is also unimpressed. \u201cYou look at it and straight away you are thinking: \u2018Player welfare, more matches, how does it fit into the schedule?\u2019 If you want to grow the game I don\u2019t know if that is the right format.\u201d",

Finally, they got their wish at Leichhardt Oval, where Ante Milicic\u2019s first outing as coach resulted in a comfortable 2-0 win over New Zealand.\nIt was with a certain sense of relief, under the floodlights of the atmospheric old suburban ground in Sydney, that the players were able to return to centre stage as goals from Emily Gielnik and Hayley Raso ensured Milicic was able to enjoy a winning debut.\n\u201cMove forward\u201d, \u201clook to the future\u201d and \u201cfocus on football\u201d have been the oft-uttered mantras in the days since Milicic took over as Stajcic\u2019s replacement \u2013 at least from the coach himself, his players and under-fire Football Federation Australia. Of course, there remain many unanswered questions about the events of the past five weeks that still need addressing, but on Thursday night, it was time to allow the spotlight to settle back on the pitch.\nThere have also been questions regarding the appointment of Milicic, in his first head coaching role, and first in the women\u2019s game, albeit altogether less searching ones, but the answer to the most obvious one \u2013 how this incarnation of the Matildas will shape up on the pitch \u2013 was immediately apparent.\nMilicic opted not to rock the boat too much with his squad selection for this Cup of Nations tournament, and nor did he discernibly change the formation or style of play of the team his predecessor led to No 6 in the world. The starting XI that took to the pitch \u2013 a full-strength team, with the injured Katrina Gorry arguably the only first-choice player to come in \u2013 set up in a familiar 4-3-3 formation.\nThe continuity in personnel and tactics appeared to serve the home side well early on, as they imposed themselves on a New Zealand side ranked 13 places below them by Fifa and who have now not beaten Australia in their last 29 attempts. Emily Gielnik in particular started brightly as most of the Matildas\u2019 forward play came down the right hand side.\nMelbourne Victory player Gielnik switched flanks on occasion with Caitlin Foord but she was stationed back on the right \u2013 and in the right place at the right time \u2013 just before the half-time break to deliver the opening goal of the game. There was an element of fortune about her finish once Steph Catley\u2019s cross reached her, which squeezed under the boot of a defender before nestling in the corner. But it was nothing if not deserved by Gielnik, and the Matildas, who had dominated the game to that point.\nThere could have been more than that solitary strike in the first half, but Sam Kerr, having already won a free-kick which Elise Kellond-Knight crashed against the cross-bar then brought a good save out of Erin Nayler with a snap header, deliberated too long while clean through on goal when scoring seemed the more likely outcome.\nKerr, captaining the side for the first time, had been described by Milicic during the week as the female version of Tim Cahill \u2013 a leader, fearless and confident. If the comparison has to be made, it is probably a fair one, although Kerr \u2013 whose every move was shadowed by a designated defender \u2013 was unable to add to her international goal tally by the time she was withdrawn after the hour mark, along with Kellond-Knight, Emily Van Egmond and Alana Kennedy.\nMilicic will have been pleased with what he saw in midfield, with Kellond-Knight and Van Egmond controlling the tempo of the game, and at the back where the defence was imperiously marshalled by Kennedy, ably assisted by Clare Polkinghorne. New Zealand striker Sarah Gregorius barely had a sniff, and when she did, on just two occasions, she was first foiled by Lydia Williams and then saw a dinked effort bounce just wide of the post. Gregorius\u2019s replacement later in the game, Paige Satchell, also brought a smart stop from Williams, but otherwise the Australia keeper enjoyed a comfortable night.\nMass substitutions have a habit of killing games, but with a new boss to impress the Matildas entering the fray for the final half hour were unwilling to settle for a 1-0 scoreline, and two of the new arrivals combined beautifully to craft a second on 74 minutes. Amy Harrison, brought into the squad as a late replacement for the injured Chloe Logarzo, played in Raso who finished neatly past Nayler to cap a remarkable comeback from fracturing three vertebrae just six months ago.\n\u201cThey delivered what I was after,\u201d Milicic said afterwards. \u201cThe girls were fantastic. There\u2019s already a clear distinct playing style, and that\u2019s important. I was very pleased with the way they went about their game plan.\u201d\nNext up for the Matildas are South Korea, who earlier in the day dished out a 5-0 thrashing to Argentina, before the South Americans follow in the tournament\u2019s final match on Wednesday. Two further games for Milicic to get to know his players, and two further games for them to raise their levels in preparation for their World Cup campaign later this year.\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to our pre-World Cup camp,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cI think this team can go to another level.\u201d",

One of Arsenal\u2019s finest moments at White Hart Lane came at Christmas 40 years ago, with this seasonal shellacking and a Liam Brady masterclass: \u201cLook at that, oh look at that!\u201d Winning the title is a distant dream for Arsenal at the moment, but they\u2019ve famously clinched it on their rivals\u2019 patch twice \u2013 in the Double-winning year of 1971, and the \u201cInvincibles\u201d season of 2003-04. Of course, Spurs\u2019 current \u201cpatch\u201d remains Wembley, while their new stadium is unfinished, which of course was the venue for the sweetest of derby triumphs, the Paul Gascoigne-inspired FA Cup semi-final win in 1991. They enjoyed this cup drubbing 10 years ago, too.\n2) Lots of people are good at rugby. Manasa Mataele is good at rugby backwards, and while falling over.\n3) There\u2019s plenty to look forward to at the European Indoor Championships this weekend, but sometimes indoor athletics goes wrong, as it did here in 2000 \u2013 six started, only three finished in the 400m semi-final. Britain\u2019s best gold medal hope this weekend is probably Laura Muir, who won the 1500m and 800m two years ago.\n4) There\u2019s no way we can let a West Indies v England one-day series pass without a look back at this, Viv Richards smacking 189 not out at Old Trafford in 1984, in the days when people just didn\u2019t smack 189 not out in ODIs. West Indies also have fond memories of beating England in the final of other international knockout competitions, the World Cup in 1979, the Champions Trophy in 2004 and when Carlos Brathwaite battered Ben Stokes at the World T20 three years ago.\n5) It\u2019s Leeds v West Brom on Friday night: a big one in the Championship, so let\u2019s go back to 1971 to join Barry Davies and a Leeds team going mad because they had every right. Sticking with the this weekend/1971 thing, it\u2019s El Cl\u00e1sico on Saturday so here\u2019s the corresponding fixture from 48 years ago: only a 1-0 win, but the Spanish version of Path\u00e9 news is still enjoyable. And another from this riff that we can\u2019t really remember why we started but we\u2019re too deep to stop now: it\u2019s Bayern v Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, who just happened to be the Bundesliga top two in 1971. Here\u2019s the latter beating the former in a crucial game on their way to winning the title.\n6) The Formula One season is almost upon us, with all the cars unveiled and tested. Give them a quick once-over here, and compare them with the finest machines of 50 years ago here, and here\u2019s some footage of that year\u2019s German grand prix, which was won by Jacky Ickx, with Jackie Stewart in second.\n1) From the early days of on-board F1 footage, here\u2019s some of Hans Heyer gunning it around Hockenheim in 1977.\n2) A gloriously pointless little graphic that shows the progression of the world table tennis top 10 rankings, set to some Les Rhythmes Digitales-esque funk.\n3) Steph Curry takes the p in the NBA All-Star game with an absurd bounced assist.\n4) This does come around every few months, but the December 2006 goal of the month competition is always worth a watch.\nSpotters\u2019 badges: Foxxxo, vasteriner, Chambazi, MSquare.",

The former begin the evening sitting at a long trestle table enjoying bread and borscht, dancing with the performers and each other, joining in the folk songs. The mood is one of a communal fiesta that gradually gives way to street revolution. We follow the story of the chance encounter of the Canadian Mark and the Ukrainian Marichka, fellow musicians who find themselves involved in the uprising and who eventually marry. But the emphasis is on recreating the feverish events of February 2014: barricades are erected, sandbags filled, crowds kettled by the riot police, people felled by snipers. In the midst of it all there is, as Marichka says, a \u201cpermanent insomnia\u201d that leads to counting sheep.\nThe staging is impressive, evoking memories of 1789, Ariane Mnouchkine\u2019s show about the French revolution. There are poignant moments such as the reminder, as we agonise over withdrawal from Europe, that the people of Kiev were prepared to sacrifice their lives for the sake of closer integration. But, although there is a constant stream of newsreel footage projected on to the side walls, I found myself wanting more hard information. What actually triggered the uprising? Was the accusation that it was exploited by far-right nationalist groups simply Russian propaganda? At what point was the reviled President Yanukovych overthrown?\nThe audience, especially the \u201cprotesters\u201d, are swept along by events without being given much analysis. What they get is a physical experience sustained by pulsating folk music from Balaklava Blues, a versatile multinational cast and the knowledge that two participants in the uprising are in their midst.

After 12 days and about 3,000 miles, he had crossed most of the continent to reach Cooma in New South Wales and was second in the competition.\nRiding unsupported, competitors were expected to complete the race within 14 days. On 31 March, Hall had set off along the Monaro Highway, which had a 100km/h (62mph) speed limit, shortly before 3am. An inquest held last year heard that at around 6.20am he was hit by a car in the northbound lane of the road, which narrowed near an intersection.\nThe driver of the car, Shegu Bobb, was at first unaware he had struck a cyclist and thought he had hit a kangaroo until he found Hall\u2019s bike embedded in the passenger side headlight. There was no evidence that the driver had been driving fast or recklessly, or with alcohol or prescribed drugs in his system, the coroner noted.\nA postmortem examination found that the cyclist had suffered multiple injuries to his head, fracturing of the spine, and multiple chest and abdominal injuries and his death had been \u201calmost instantaneous\u201d.\nThe design of the road and its shoulder rendered it unsuitable for cyclists, particularly at night, the investigators said.\nThe inquest heard that Hall had been wearing dark clothing with reflective panels, although the items were not dealt with in accordance with normal police procedures for retaining evidence so their reflective properties could not be tested.\nDr Boss said: \u201cMr Hall\u2019s death was avoidable, which makes the loss of this remarkable person even more keenly felt by his family and the community. It is unfortunate that the investigation into his death has been to some degree compromised by the loss of significant evidence in the form of his clothing and bicycle accoutrements.\n\u201cThere is, however, sufficient evidence for his death to be the catalyst for changes that will enhance rider safety into the future.\u201d\nThe coroner made six recommendations including a call for the Australian Capital Territory and other state governments to require cyclists to use a flashing rear light when driving in low-light conditions on rural roads.\nDr Boss also recommended that Australia\u2019s national standards body review rules on lighting equipment for bikes. She referred the matter to the federal police to review whether any offence had been made.\nHall won numerous long-distance races during his career including the 29,000km World Cycle Race, the Tour Divide and the Trans America.",

        "content": "Topher Grace\u2019s Star Wars Always supercut blends footage of the best-known films to suggest a radical vision for the saga\nImagine if all of the Star Wars movies had been produced by a single creative mind across 20 years or so, as opposed to being developed over roughly half a century as a mixed bag of movies courtesy of wildly varying creative forces. The result, shrunk down into miniature, might have looked something like a new Star Wars Always trailer posted this week by actor and superfan Topher Grace, which blends footage from 10 of the best-known films into a remarkable, seamless five-minute cut.\nFleetingly, it\u2019s possible to imagine how Star Wars might have looked if the dreaded prequels had left Jar Jar Binks in his Gungan hellhole, and excised 99% of Anakin Skywalker\u2019s emo tendencies. In fact, the future Darth Vader isn\u2019t seen prior to his teenage years \u2013 no pod racing on Tatooine here (though it\u2019s impossible to get rid of him altogether without ruining the trailer\u2019s flow). Bouncing Zebedee-Yoda from Attack of the Clones is also kept firmly in his box, while none of George Lucas\u2019s hapless CGI additions for the 1997 special edition versions of the first trilogy are allowed to rear their ugly digital heads.\nThere are, however, jarring moments when Alec Guinness\u2019s Obi Wan Kenobi fondly remembers his old friend Anakin and when Hayden Christensen\u2019s image flashes up. Almost 15 years after Revenge of the Sith hit multiplexes, it is still tempting to imagine an alternative reality in which an entirely different trilogy of prequels made it into cinemas. How might those movies have looked if they were a little more rugged, better cast and freed of the need to tell a history that would have been better left as shadowy, half-imagined myth? Christensen\u2019s whingeing, wooden delivery manages to ruin even the Yoda scene on Degobah in Empire Strikes Back.\nSurprisingly, the trailer\u2019s Han Solo segment, which includes footage of Harrison Ford in the original trilogy (and The Force Awakens) and Alden Ehrenreich in last year\u2019s Solo, isn\u2019t so painful to watch. Might Ron Howard\u2019s movie eventually stand the test of time better than the prequels have been able to? Likewise, the short segments from Rogue One in the mix are easily blended, just as Gareth Edwards\u2019s film somehow added organic, naturalistic weight and depth to the first trilogy.\nThe trailer\u2019s title, Star Wars Always, nicely flags up the saga\u2019s penchant for stylistic symmetry, as Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi in 1977\u2019s Star Wars and Kylo Ren tries and fails to do the same to phantom Luke in The Last Jedi. There is even a cheeky spin on Yoda\u2019s famous line in Empire when discussing Luke\u2019s status as the light side of the Force\u2019s last hope with ghost Obi-Wan: \u201cNo, there is another.\u201d Many fans have assumed the Jedi master was referring to Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia, but what if he really meant Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey? A stretch perhaps, given that Lucas had a completely different vision for the final trilogy of Star Wars films than Disney has given us.\nIf the trailer represents the best bits of the older and newer Star Wars movies, blended with the least-worst bits of the prequel trilogy, then that perhaps tells us everything we need to know about the saga\u2019s current legacy. Somewhere out there is probably a completely different cut with a lot more Jar Jar, segments on Anakin\u2019s romance with Padm\u00e9 Amidala and the awful CGI band from Jabba\u2019s palace in Return of the Jedi. The only reason to watch it would be to marvel at the folly of the creative decisions involved.",

I oftentimes speak to people starting up their own companies. They\u2019re \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201coverjoyed\u201d to be entrepreneurs. Good for them. It\u2019s important to be passionate. But that\u2019s not the most important thing. It\u2019s not even close.\nPassion only accounts for so much. Passion doesn\u2019t pay the bills. Passion doesn\u2019t collect cash from deadbeat customers. It doesn\u2019t avoid employees from not showing up and vendors from not making their deliveries. Just having passion doesn\u2019t hide the fact that it\u2019s a cold, hard world out there and that no matter how many people are wishing you well, very few of them will write checks. If you\u2019re working a corporate job and dreaming of the life of an entrepreneur pursuing your \u201cpassion\u201d then know that that passion will not replace a guaranteed paycheck, snow days, flex time, coffee breaks, reimbursed lunches or week-long conferences in Vegas.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Then go to the data. Just this month Vistaprint, a popular online marketing service for small businesses, released a survey of about 1,000 business owners in the US, Canada and UK who run companies with fewer than nine employees. What did they find? A solid third of them had lost the \u201cpassion\u201d that they started with.\nI get it. I also think the other two-thirds are not being entirely truthful. That number is probably much higher.\nSure, running a small business has its potential advantages: more control, more independence, more freedom to make decisions and more chances of hitting the jackpot. But these are just potentials. What\u2019s the reality?\nJust ask those Vistaprint respondents. They complained about the high levels of stress, the lack of a regular paycheck and the myth of work-life balance. Many were frustrated when they found themselves earning less than they thought. Big surprise.\nThe nice people at Vistaprint tried to put a good face on the data by saying that \u201can overwhelming majority of respondents say they have not considered closing their businesses despite the challenges they\u2019ve faced over the years.\u201d The company also offers tips for getting back on track like \u201creminding yourself why you started the business in the first place\u201d and seeking \u201cnew challenges\u201d, setting \u201cnew goals\u201d and \u201chitting the reset button\u201d.\nHere\u2019s my tip: make money.\nMy most successful clients who own small businesses aren\u2019t incredibly passionate about what they do either. But they generally enjoy their work and are happy to be running their own show. What does excite them the most about their business is the money. That\u2019s because a business is just a business. It exists to provide a livelihood for the owners, their employees and their families. If it\u2019s run the right way, it can grow in value and become an asset to sell someday. The passion comes from all the things a business can help you buy to make your life better: a decent house, a few vacations, a college education for your kids, a comfortable retirement, charitable donations. I like my business. But I\u2019m passionate about those things.\nYour business isn\u2019t some romantic fantasy. It\u2019s just a business. View it that way from the beginning. You may not become more passionate about it. But you\u2019ll be happier.",

What We Had is the writing-directing debut of actor Elizabeth Chomko, with Hilary Swank and Michael Shannon as siblings trying to persuade their dad that after a long, happy marriage it\u2019s time for their mum to be moved into care home \u2013 or \u201cmemory centre\u201d as the glossy brochure grimly puts it.\nSwank is chef Bridget, who flies home to Chicago when her mother Ruth (Blythe Danner), who has dementia, is found wandering in the middle of night halfway across town during a snowstorm. Bridget\u2019s brother, Nick (Shannon), thinks it\u2019s time for professional care. Their dad, Burt (Robert Forster), flat out refuses to live apart from his wife. Who can feed and bathe her, tend to her memories better than he can? The intimacy between Burt and Ruth is gently moving: this old-school macho guy putting on marigolds to bleach his wife\u2019s roots.\nThe script, inspired by Chomko\u2019s grandparents\u2019 marriage, throws up plenty of authentic-looking observations of life with Alzheimer\u2019s. Like the hospital doctor, who with bland professional detachment, informs the family that Ruth has been given a pelvic examination because women with dementia are frequently sexually assaulted during wandering episodes. But the dialogue feels a little soapy in places, though brightened up with the occasional flash of humour.\nAnd credit to the cast for adding substance. Danner gives a classy, restrained performance as Ruth, and it\u2019s nice to see Shannon without a psychopathic scowl. But I could never quite believe in this family. And is it an emotional cop-out to write difficult scenes \u2013such as Ruth making a pass at her son \u2013 but play them off-screen?",

        "content": "The irrepressible Fernando Alonso\u2019s farewell to Formula One at the end of last season may not have been the final curtain.\nMcLaren are testing in Barcelona and they revealed on Wednesday that the 37-year-old will now be an ambassador for the team and test their F1 cars over the next two years. Having the two-times world champion in their set-up is a boon while they rebuild with two far less experienced drivers but crucially it also ensures the Spaniard remains at the heart of McLaren and keeps his hand in should he make a return to F1 in 2021.\nAlonso called it a day last year after 17 years in F1, his enthusiasm for racing sapped by four years of underperformance from McLaren. But despite his vocal criticism of Honda\u2019s power unit during three of those four years, his relationship with the team remained strong.\nAlonso is pursuing the triple crown and has McLaren\u2019s wholehearted support in doing so. He has wins at Monaco and the Le Mans 24 Hours. With the F1 championship as well, only the Indy 500 remains. Graham Hill, the only driver to have achieved the feat, considered the F1 title (rather than Monaco), Le Mans and Indy as the true triple \u2013 but either way Alonso is two-thirds of the way there.\nThe team are fully backing his shot at Indy. He will race for McLaren when they enter a works team at the Brickyard in May. This year he already has a win at the Daytona 24 under his belt and is leading the world endurance championship, which is building to its climax at Le Mans in June.\nAlonso\u2019s calendar is busy but he will join McLaren\u2019s other double world champion, Mika H\u00e4kkinen, as a team ambassador.\n\u201cMcLaren is a special team,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cDespite the challenges we have endured recently, it remains so. I said before I stopped racing in Formula One last year that I see myself with McLaren for a long time to come, so I am delighted at this new role.\u201d\nHe will also be advising engineers and drivers, and the commercial value of a driver of his stature and popularity was clearly not lost on the team.\nSpeaking after the announcement Alonso, who has never ruled out a return, said: \u201cIf one day Formula One again arrives at the moment when I can be competitive, and I can eventually be winning, I cannot be relaxed at home in that moment. I need to keep updated and the best way is to be involved somehow.\u201d\nZak Brown, McLaren\u2019s chief executive, has openly targeted 2021 \u2013 when the regulations change and, he is hoping, a financial levelling of the playing field will occur \u2013 as the date when the team may hope to be able to compete with the top three again. Alonso clearly believes he would be ready to climb back in if they have the machinery.\n\u201cI feel at the peak of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cSo probably being at home is a waste of time and possibilities for everyone. I\u2019m doing different, iconic races now. I feel in the best moment of my driving career, so I hope to win as many races as I can. I [will] also stay involved in F1 life, just in case.\n\u201cI\u2019m stronger than ever now, at 37, physically, mentally, and the background that you have in different categories and different driving styles. So I feel very good now, very competitive in any car that I jump in.\u201d\nCertainly he will be buoyed by McLaren\u2019s current form. Reading anything into testing times is a dangerous game but with Lando Norris the quickest driver on Tuesday and Carlos Sainz on top of the timesheets on Wednesday, McLaren have enjoyed their best pre-season in five years. The plan to be on a strong upward curve by 2021 is at least starting from the right place.\nAlonso also wants to nurture and mentor McLaren\u2019s young drivers. For Norris, having Alonso in his corner in his debut year could be invaluable.\nNorris, Sainz, engineers and designers have a prized asset in Alonso. He in turn described the team as his \u201cspiritual home\u201d \u2013 one that is now the potential stage for a dramatic F1 encore.",

        "content": "They are rejecting clean eating and queueing around the block for plates of pasta. But is the trend due to the rise of Instagram or vegetarianism?\nYou would be forgiven for thinking pasta is struggling in these carb-concious, Instagram-centric times. After all, a big bowl of beige wheat hardly seems de rigueur. But pasta is popular again, thanks largely to the supposedly starch-averse twenty- and thirtysomethings.\nTake Padella. The pasta place outside Borough Market in London is notorious for the queues of young professionals that snake from its entrance as mealtimes approach. Tim Siadatan, the chef and co-owner, had no idea when he opened the restaurant in 2016 that punters would be willing to stand in line for a plate of pappardelle. \u201cIt genuinely hadn\u2019t crossed my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought during busy periods a queue might form in the way a queue might form at lunchtime in Pret, but none of us imagined it would become a thing we\u2019d have to manage.\u201d Nowadays, 500 diners turn up every day to try its wildly popular fresh pasta dishes, such as the interminably Instagrammed pici cacio e pepe. In the past few years, a clutch of pasta-peddling rivals have opened across the city, from Pastaio in Soho to Campania & Jones in Bethnal Green.\nBut the passion for posh pici is not confined to the capital. The hype around Pasta Loco in Bristol is so frenzied that diners are advised to book 22 weeks ahead to secure a table; its sister restaurant, Pasta Ripiena, opened last year to similar fanfare. Cardiff\u2019s I Giardini di Sorrento has been garlanded for its dishes inspired by the Amalfi coast. Elsewhere, the French restaurant group Big Mamma so skilfully tapped into millennials\u2019 taste for Italian cuisine that it became the fastest-growing restaurant group in Paris. Last week, it opened Gloria, its first site in the UK, in Shoreditch, east London.\nAway from restaurants, a love of pasta has spawned cookbooks (Laura Goodman\u2019s Carbs was published in October) and podcast episodes (millennial memoirist Dolly Alderton waxed lyrical about pasta with the actor and gourmand Stanley Tucci on a recent episode of her series Love Stories), while truffle-adorned tortellini was the dish of choice among influencers at this year\u2019s Copenhagen fashion week.\nSo, what is behind the renewed interest? One reason, evident from even a cursory scroll through Instagram, is pasta\u2019s popularity on the photo-sharing site: it is awash with posts bearing hashtags such as #choosepasta or #girlswithgluten. \u201cPeople love my pictures of pasta,\u201d says the food writer Rosie Birkett, who has 75,000 followers on Instagram. \u201cThere\u2019s a familiarity to pasta \u2013 people have childhood memories or holiday associations that make it nostalgic. Being able to taste something in our mind\u2019s eye is at play here.\u201d It is this tastebud-teasing effect that Siadatan credits for the excitement around his pici cacio e pepe, which was one of the most Instagrammed restaurant dishes in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most beautiful dish, but people can look at it and go: that is going to be fucking delicious.\u201d\nVictor Lugger, the 34-year-old co-owner of Big Mamma, thinks the rustic element of the dolce vita aesthetic attracts millennials, who have been force-fed the idea of authenticity. \u201cThe Italian way of partying appeals to a generation craving human contact and real moments,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Italy, you can imagine yourself drinking negronis in a piazza while the sun goes down. There would be free food and by the end you realise it has only cost \u20ac15, but you\u2019re completely drunk and you\u2019ve been there four hours.\u201d\nPasta\u2019s surge in popularity has extended to homes, too. Sales of the 13 bestselling lines of pasta produced by the grocery brand Napolina have risen 13% to \u00a329.7m in the past year, according to the analyst Nielsen. Overall, the dry pasta market has increased in value (+0.1%) and volume (+2.6%) in the same period, according to Kantar, another analyst. The latter says \u201cpre-families and young families\u201d \u2013 in other words, millennials \u2013 are driving the growth. While the increase is not huge, any rise is significant \u2013 pasta is emerging from four years of decline.\nThere is also the rise of vegetarianism to consider. \u201cLots of us are trying to eat less meat, and pasta is probably the simplest way I know of making sad vegetables wildly appealing,\u201d says Goodman. Then there is the fact that pasta is a commendably democratic foodstuff.\n\u201cI can serve the best-quality pasta, but it will only cost me 50p per kilo,\u201d says Lugger. This affordability is entrenched in Italian culinary traditions, says the Guardian\u2019s Feast columnist Rachel Roddy, who lives in Rome. \u201cThe Italians have names like \u2018sawdust\u2019 for pasta \u2013 there\u2019s egg pasta with 20 egg yolks and there\u2019s a sawdust pasta you\u2019d have with boiled greens. It straddles everybody.\u201d\nCould pasta\u2019s popularity be part of the backlash against the restrictive world of clean eating? \u201cPasta brings joy to lots of us, unlike clean eating,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should see eating spaghetti as a rebellious act. Spaghetti isn\u2019t the opposite of clean eating.\u201d A recent World Health Organization report reiterated the importance of carbs to a healthy diet. It is a message worth promoting, says Goodman. \u201cThe word \u2018carb\u2019 is often used as a synonym for \u2018unhealthy food\u2019, which is so far from the truth.\u201d\nMichela Chiappa of the Chiappas, three sisters in their 30s who write about Italian cooking, suggests that pasta and clean eating are, in fact, compatible. \u201cMy definition is: strip it back. You should be eating carbs, but eat \u2018good\u2019 carbs. Cook from scratch with fresh ingredients.\u201d Focus on provenance, too. At the Big Mamma restaurants in Paris, authenticity informs the produce as much as it does the experience, says Lugger. \u201cWe cook everything ourselves; nothing is too salty. This is a generation of people who really care about what they\u2019re putting in their bodies.\u201d It is easy to draw a line between this back-to-basics kitchen mindset and the wider resurgence of crafting \u2013 knitting smugly in cafes, whittling wooden spoons, that sort of thing. Indeed, I have friends in their late 20s who flit from channelling their \u201cinner nonnas\u201d at pasta-making tutorials to salivating over the handiwork of real-life nonnas via the YouTube channel Pasta Grannies, which treats its 370,000 subscribers to videos of Italian grandmothers\u2019 culinary techniques.\nRoddy says pasta\u2019s versatility makes it a blank canvas. Perhaps this is a neat metaphor for the buzz around it \u2013 it is a repository for myriad conflicting cultural concerns. The revival hints at a rejection of carb-phobia, but others may deem it an Instagram-fuelled fad. And while there are whiffs of an elitist fetishisation of fresh produce, pasta also appeals because it is cheap and cheering. As Roddy concludes, though, pasta is just, well, food. As trends come and go, that is a mentality worth tucking into.",

        "content": "Romelu Lukaku\u2019s two goals against Crystal Palace on Wednesday took him to 111 in the Premier League, level with Dion Dublin as the 20th most prolific scorer in the competition\u2019s history. This was only the fourth time he has completed 90 minutes under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and they were his first goals in almost two months, and yet there is a sense Lukaku as much as anybody is benefiting from the burst of Norwegian sunshine over Old Trafford.\nPerhaps it does not seem like much for the 10th most expensive signing in history to pull level with the presenter of a daytime-TV property show. It should be acknowledged there is some evidence football was played before 1992 and some forwards may have amassed many more goals before the Premier League existed. But still, Lukaku now stands only two goals behind Ian Wright (who admittedly was 28 at the start of the first Premier League season) and nine behind Steven Gerrard in the overall rankings. He is 25.\nThere is something slightly unsettling about Lukaku. He is a player who seems to draw disproportionate criticism. There is something about him that feels unconvincing. His first touch occasionally seems heavy. His movement at times seems unimaginative. He is capable of missing fairly straightforward chances, as he did early on at Selhurst Park.\nBut then he is also capable of executing finishes such as the two that brought his goals. Receiving the ball from Luke Shaw for the first, he let the ball run outside his right foot, which took him away from Martin Kelly but not near enough to James McArthur for the midfielder to make a block, while also giving him enough space to shape the ball round James Tomkins and into the bottom corner past Vicente Guaita, who was probably unsighted by the defenders. It was somehow both clinical and graceful.\nThe second demonstrated great awareness even before the skill of the finish. As Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s header dropped, it would have been easy for Lukaku to come to the ball, to challenge Jeffrey Schlupp. Instead, he read the trajectory and let the ball drop over his shoulder, using his body to hold off Schlupp, and then had the athleticism and technique to get over the ball at the top of its bounce and hook it past Guaita.\nThe top 20\n1\u00a0Alan Shearer, 260 goals\n2\u00a0Wayne Rooney\u00a0208\n3\u00a0Andrew Cole\u00a0187\n4\u00a0Frank Lampard\u00a0177\n5\u00a0Thierry Henry\u00a0175\n6\u00a0Robbie Fowler\u00a0163\n7\u00a0Jermain Defoe\u00a0162\n8\u00a0Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u00a0161\n9\u00a0Michael Owen\u00a0150\n10\u00a0Les Ferdinand\u00a0149\n11\u00a0Teddy Sheringham\u00a0146\n12\u00a0Robin van Persie\u00a0144\n13\u00a0Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\u00a0127\n14\u00a0Robbie Keane\u00a0126\n15\u00a0Nicolas Anelka\u00a0125\n16=\u00a0Harry Kane\u00a0123\n16=\u00a0Dwight Yorke\u00a0123\n18\u00a0Steven Gerrard\u00a0120\n19\u00a0Ian Wright\u00a0113\n20=\u00a0Dion Dublin\u00a0111\n20=\u00a0Romelu Lukaku\u00a0111\nSo what, then, is the problem? Lukaku scores goals consistently, getting into double figures in the league in each of the past seven seasons, something all the more remarkable given only two have been spent with a \u201cbig six\u201d side. He has a remarkable range of attributes, technical and physical. The issue, perhaps, is that he is not quite what he appears to be. The most striking thing about Lukaku is his size. He has the physique of a classic target man, and that allows him to do things that are impossible for others. And yet he is not a target man.\nHe can play with his back to goal but it is not necessarily his preferred position. There were times under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho when he became isolated. Some players thrive on that. Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, for instance, the bulk of his international experience with Venezuela being not only as a lone forward but as a lonely forward, is adept at playing as far away from his teammates as possible, relishing the challenge of turning a loose ball into a free-kick or a throw-in.\nBut that is not Lukaku. His best two performances in the past 12 months have probably both come on the right wing, for Belgium against Brazil in the World Cup quarter-finals and for United at Arsenal in the FA Cup. On neither occasion was he playing as an orthodox winger; both times his job was essentially to stay high up the pitch behind an attacking left-back. On both occasions he was devastating on the counter. Lukaku may have a chest that seems to demand the ball be pinged into it but he is probably better with the ball played in front of him.\nThere are those moments of occasional clumsiness. Perhaps they are the result of an occasional loss of concentration but such aberrations do seem to be a feature of big players in general, as though it is very difficult when bulk begins to go the wrong way to make the necessary adjustments.\nIn target men, that might be forgiven, but there Lukaku falls victim of the underlying recognition that he is an all-round striker, simultaneously both target man and not target man so nobody knows quite what standards to apply. It is worth remembering, though, amid all the doubts, that the only player younger than him who has scored more Premier League goals is Harry Kane, who was born 10 weeks after Lukaku.\nHe scores goals, is tactically adaptable, capable of technical excellence and happens to be big and strong as well. Perhaps he is not such an obvious part of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s vision as the more mobile trio of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard but as a back-up and a more physical option, Lukaku still has plenty to offer.",

Plus, how American border vigilantism led to Trump\u2019s wall\nGood morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories.\nThe much-heralded second summit between Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, ended early and abruptly after an apparent disagreement over sanctions. At a press conference in Hanoi on Thursday, Trump told reporters the North Korean delegation had demanded the lifting of international sanctions \u201cin their entirety\u201d in return for a partial dismantling of the country\u2019s nuclear infrastructure. \u201cThey were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas we wanted but we couldn\u2019t give up all the sanctions for that,\u201d Trump said. As yet, there are no plans for a third summit.\nTheatrical reboot. Expectations for the talks were always low, with few expecting a final deal on denuclearisation. There had been some hope, however, that the meeting in Vietnam might lead to a declaration that the Korean war is finally over.\n\u2018Great leader\u2019. Trump continued to praise Kim in Hanoi, describing the brutal authoritarian as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d and \u201cquite a character\u201d.\nDuring more than seven hours of explosive testimony before the House oversight committee on Wednesday, the lawyer, fixer and convicted felon Michael Cohen dropped a series of bombshells with the potential to sink the Trump presidency. Describing his former client as a \u201cracist,\u201d a \u201cconman,\u201d and a \u201ccheat\u201d, Cohen accused the president of knowing in advance about key events under investigation in the Russia inquiry \u2013 including the infamous \u201cTrump Tower meeting\u201d \u2013 and of committing criminal conspiracy in the alleged cover up of his affair with an adult film star. Both claims could leave Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr, in legal jeopardy.\nDamning portrait. In a story that reflects the extent of Trump\u2019s vanity, Cohen claimed his former boss used a straw bidder and $60,000 from the Trump Foundation to purchase a portrait of himself at an art auction in 2013, ensuring the painting fetched the highest price at the event.\nKey takeaways. Ed Pilkington breaks down the significant moments from Cohen\u2019s testimony, which included the revelation that the southern district of New York is still pursuing further, as-yet-undisclosed lines of inquiry into Trump\u2019s affairs.\nThe House of Representatives has passed its first major piece of gun legislation for almost a quarter of a century, approving by 240 votes to 190 a measure requiring federal background checks for all firearms sales. While the bill is unlikely to be taken up by a Republican-controlled Senate, it is a symbolic victory for gun control campaigners \u2013 and another blow for the National Rifle Association, which is facing a series of regulatory and financial problems as well as political opposition.\nCampaign spending. Despite Trump\u2019s full support for the NRA, which spent record amounts supporting his election in 2016, the organisation\u2019s revenue has fallen in the last two years. Its spending on the 2018 midterms was $9.4m, roughly a third of the $27m it spent during the 2014 cycle.\nA Gallup poll measuring global opinion has found the US almost neck and neck with Russia for the first time in terms of confidence in their international leadership, with both countries lagging behind China.\nJustin Trudeau has dismissed calls for him to resign after his former attorney general accused the Canadian prime minister\u2019s officials of a sustained effort to dissuade her from prosecuting a major engineering company accused of bribery.\nPakistan has agreed to release the captured Indian fighter pilot as a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d after he was seized when his plane was shot down amid rising hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours over the disputed Kashmir region.\nThe EU has accused Facebook of repeatedly withholding data detailing its supposed efforts to combat online disinformation ahead of this year\u2019s European elections.\nHow to live with the other 5,000 species in your home\nThe biologist Rob Dunn is the David Attenborough of the domestic sphere, an expert on the thousands of tiny species with which we unwittingly share our homes. Lars Eriksen invited Dunn to his house in Copenhagen to show him what Dunn calls \u201cthe jungle of everyday life\u201d.\nHow American violence brought about the border wall\nAnti-migrant violence on the US-Mexico border has been rife since at least the 1970s, from the brutality of the KKK\u2019s informal \u201cborder watch\u201d to the often sadistic tactics of the official border patrol. Trump\u2019s rhetoric has thrown fuel on the fire, writes Greg Grandin.\nAn unlikely champion offers hope for the Everglades\nThe Florida Everglades are facing devastation thanks to a combination of climate change and human development. But now conservationists have an unlikely ally: the state\u2019s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Oliver Milman reports from Islamorada.\nChina: the world\u2019s concrete superpower\nChina pours more concrete in two years than the US did in the whole 20th century. The Three Gorges dam and Beijing Daxing airport are just two reasons why China is today\u2019s concrete superpower. Amy Hawkins reports from Beijing for the Guardian\u2019s Concrete Week series.\nRepublicans obviously think they\u2019re helping the president by publicly trashing his former lawyer. But Michael Cohen\u2019s loyalty to Trump eventually cost him everything, says Richard Wolffe \u2013 and it will cost his congressional defenders dearly, too.\nTrump\u2019s loyalists in the House seemed to think that was the end of the story.

        "content": "The author and illustrator Tomi Ungerer, who has died aged 87, was best known for his visually stunning, witty and intelligent children\u2019s books, but he was also an extraordinary designer, sculptor, satirist, farmer and political activist, an elegant eccentric who described himself as an archivist of human absurdity.\nHis books, of which he wrote more than 140, and which have been translated into 30 languages, have delighted, amused and entertained young readers, but have often also frightened and unsettled them. Fear, Ungerer believed, is a vital element in childhood; it has to be dealt with, and in doing that, children will learn how to be courageous.\nOne of his finest picture books is The Three Robbers (1961), in which a gang of brigands attack carriages on the highway and steal the passengers\u2019 riches. Dark, scary illustrations show galloping horses and savage assailants wielding double-headed axes.\nOn one moonlit night, the carriage they stop contains only one little girl, a penniless orphan. She is delighted to meet them. Luckily she has no treasure. But with her courage, and her practical good sense, she confounds the robbers, and persuades them to abandon their evil ways and put the stolen money to good use.\nThe robbers agree to spend their ill-gotten gains on a huge castle where abandoned children can live happily together and enjoy a proper childhood. This life-affirming story is told using bold colours, striking silhouettes and subtle details.\nThe imagery has the powerful simplicity of a poster, an art form in which Ungerer also excelled, most memorably with the one he produced for Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 film Dr Strangelove.\nA teacher once described Ungerer as being \u201cperverse and subversive\u201d, and you can see something of this in his semi-autobiographical book No Kiss for Mother (1973), about a schoolboy kitten who strives to avoid his mother\u2019s embrace. With slightly murky pencil illustrations, it features playground violence, catapults and bloodshed, and at home in the cat family\u2019s kitchen there are myriad revolting details, including a mouse-mincing machine and a rat processor. The expression of the gimlet-eyed kitten on the cover will be familiar to anyone who has dealt with challenging children.\nBorn in Strasbourg, in France, Jean-Thomas, known as Tomi, was the youngest child of Theo Ungerer, a clockmaker, and his wife, Alice (nee Essler). Theo died when Tomi was three, and his childhood became increasingly difficult.\nWhen the Germans invaded the region, his mother tongue became a forbidden language. He became, as he wrote, a refugee in his own country. Under the new regime, his first school assignment was, he said, \u201cto draw a Jew\u201d.\nDrawing was always second nature to Tomi, and he rebelled by becoming a sort of schoolboy war artist, recording what it was like to be under German occupation with paintings and drawings of the allied bombings, tanks, guns and ruined houses. These drawings are astonishing in their confident handling of perspective, composition and atmosphere, conveying the menacing tilt of warplanes curving through the sky. His mother preserved those drawings, as well as some wickedly funny caricatures of German soldiers.\nIt was perhaps because of those difficult times that as an adult he always had a respect for children, and when he became a writer he never patronised them \u2013 you never knew what they had been through.\nAfter school, Ungerer enrolled at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Strasbourg, but he stayed only a year before deciding to go travelling, first across Europe, and then, lured by the promise of jazz and inspired by the work of Saul Steinberg, to the US. He arrived in New York in 1956 with $60 in his pocket and a trunk bursting with drawings and manuscripts.\nThe publisher Ursula Nordstrom of Harper & Row spotted his potential and commissioned his series of children\u2019s stories about the Mellops \u2013 a dauntless family of pigs and their pet sausage dog. The first, The Mellops Go Flying, was published in 1957. Soon he was working as a designer for magazines and advertising, and became a restaurant critic for Playboy magazine.\nAlso in New York at that time was another future publishing phenomenon, Eric Carle, author of The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Carle well remembers seeing Ungerer driving around Manhattan in a large cream Bentley.\nHowever, Ungerer, whose wartime experiences had left him with a hatred of injustice and intolerance, was not content to rest on his laurels. A committed political activist, he fought for many causes.\nThe violent imagery of his anti-Vietnam war posters, commissioned, then rejected, by Columbia University, caused considerable controversy, as did his explicit work in the world of adult erotica, exhibited without problem in Paris but to much protest in London. He was forced to self-publish his book of erotic work, Fornicon (1969), but the surrounding scandal unnerved his publishers and led to his hugely popular children\u2019s books being banned from libraries.\nA few new and reissued children\u2019s titles, as well as a memoir, Tomi: A Childhood Under the Nazis (1998), were published in the intervening years but most were sadly allowed to go out of print until 2008, when Phaidon reissued a number of his classic books, including the wonderful Moon Man (first published in 1966) \u2013 a thought-provoking, witty fable in which the man in the moon decides to visit Earth, hoping to join in the fun. On arrival he is rejected as an alien, and cruelly thrown into jail. One day he realises that he is in his third quarter, and is soon slim enough to slip between the bars, and return to his home in the sky.\nThe rejection of his adult work prompted Ungerer and his third wife, Yvonne (nee Wright), to leave New York in 1971 to become farmers in a remote, rugged part of Nova Scotia, Canada. This led to a new surge of creativity for Ungerer, who filled journals with enchanting free brush drawings and watercolours of the landscape, birds and animals, published as Far Out Isn\u2019t Far Enough in 1983 and made into a film in 2012. His writing in the book is both down to earth and poetic, as in this delicate description of sandpipers that accompanies a breezy little drawing: \u201cLike busy little sewing machines on their needle-thin legs, they stitch the sandy shore onto the water\u2019s edge.\u201d\nIn 1976 the Ungerers moved to another dramatic and remote spot, this time in West Cork, on the south-west tip of Ireland, and raised a family there. The magical coastline and the sea with its mythical undertow inspired Ungerer\u2019s book Fog Island (2012), about two children who set off on a mysterious boat journey which is not just a thrilling adventure but also a heartfelt exploration of Ungerer\u2019s love for his adopted country.\nFor the rest of his life Ungerer divided his time between Ireland and Strasbourg. In 2007 a museum dedicated to his work opened in his home town, to which he had given a large part of his output in 1975.\nHe received many awards over his lifetime, including the Hans Christian Andersen award for illustration in 1998 and the Erich K\u00e4stner prize for literature in 2003. In 1992 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Council of Europe in Strasbourg named him an ambassador for children and education in 2000, and in 2002 he was made an Officier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.\nHe is survived by Yvonne, their three children, Aria, Lukas and Pascal, a daughter, Phoebe, from an earlier marriage, to Miriam (nee Lancaster), which ended in divorce, two grandchildren and a sister, Vivette.\n Tomi (Jean-Thomas) Ungerer, author and artist, born 28 November 1931; died 8 February 2019",

        "content": "Wales, England and Ireland have a chance of glory in Japan \u2013 the Six Nations trumps the Rugby Championship for preparation\nBefore the start of the Six Nations this month, Ireland were regarded as Europe\u2019s prime challengers in the World Cup. Then it was England after their emphatic victory in Dublin and denuding of France at Twickenham, but in the third round the odds on the favourites New Zealand becoming the first team to win the Webb Elis Trophy for a third consecutive time shrink.\nWales\u2019s toppling of England in Cardiff, together with Ireland\u2019s scratchy win in Rome, is perceived as making a second European conquest of the world more possible than probable. \u201cWales won by default in \u2018rubbish\u2019 Six Nations clash with England,\u201d blared one headline in New Zealand this week. The rubbish referred to the lack of space either side manufactured with the ball in hand, but matches in the knockout stage of a World Cup can be just as claustrophobic.\nThe All Blacks will not be breathing any easier and there is South Africa to add to the power mix. There have been three major coaching tactical triumphs during the season in Europe: Joe Schmidt masterminding Ireland\u2019s victory against New Zealand in the autumn when his side played with a relentless intensity throughout; Eddie Jones bouncing back Schmidt\u2019s gameplan to his rival in Dublin, and Warren Gatland doing much the same to Jones last weekend while devising a canny possession game and denying England lineouts through a low penalty count and kicking that kept the ball in play.\nThere was not a response on the field from the losing side in any of the matches: even the All Blacks could not think their way out of trouble. A common theme in the three Tests was that the underdog prevailed each time, and by a full beard rather than a whisker. It is why Ireland and England are no more and no less likely to prevail in Japan than they were a couple of weeks ago.\nThey need certain players to be fit, but so do New Zealand, and what the Six Nations is showing is that it has developed as a better way to prepare for the World Cup than the Rugby Championship, which has been dominated by New Zealand this decade. One reason that Ireland and Wales have closed the gap with the major southern hemisphere nations is that, unlike at the start of the professional age, they are no longer exposed in terms of strength and conditioning; neither are they blinded by emotion.\nWales are regarded as an outside bet for the World Cup despite a run of 12 successive victories, but they are not a side anyone will be anxious to meet in the later stages of the World Cup, as Sir Clive Woodward remarked at the weekend. A country with a relatively small playing base and a regional system that has yet to take root has under Gatland become resilient enough to overcome the loss of players such as Sam Warburton (who on Friday is the subject of a BBC Wales documentary on why he had to give up rugby at the age of 29), Rhys Webb, Taulupe Faletau and Leigh Halfpenny. Like Schmidt\u2019s Ireland, it is about fitting into a system honed in hours on the training field.\nGatland\u2019s ability to squeeze the best out of his team has made him the media favourite to replace Eddie Jones as England\u2019s head coach, whenever that may be with the Australian contracted until 2021. England sounded out Gatland, who had enjoyed a trophy-rich stint with Wasps earlier in the decade, in 2007, a few weeks before Wales called him, but did not follow it up.\nJones has hardly been a failure, but he will be judged on the World Cup. Gatland remarked at the weekend that England had developed a habit of not delivering when it mattered, which was slightly harsh considering it was the third round of the Six Nations and they had already won in Ireland. The same was said about England in 1999, 2000 and 2001. And then came 2003.\nGatland will be in demand when he leaves Wales after the World Cup and the Rugby Football Union, even at a time when it is cutting back, will be able to offer him a greater salary than anyone else. The question is whether the fit would be right for a coach whose career has been spent at teams who were not mainstream: Connacht, Ireland, Wasps, Waikato and Wales. All of them punched above their weight under him, collectively strong and compact.\nEngland, the country everyone likes to beat, would be different, as would its domestic system. Gatland is the overlord of Welsh rugby where, as in Ireland and New Zealand, the national team is at the top of the pyramid. Jones has to deal with a powerful union of clubs who have become emboldened by an infusion of cash from a private equity company. There could be trouble ahead. Jones has largely remained above the politics, but non-interference has not been an approach taken by Gatland.\nFor the moment, his eye is on the grand slam. Wales\u2019s final two matches are in Scotland and at home against Ireland, as they were in 2005 when they romped to victory at Murrayfield before achieving their first victory over the men in green in Cardiff for 22 years, momentum taking them through.\nThat is unlikely to be enough in a season of flux. Ireland may have struggled to re-establish their balance after the manner of their defeat against England, but Schmidt will come to Cardiff armed with a plan. The title may look beyond Ireland with England\u2019s final two matches at home against Italy and Scotland, two teams who between them have conceded 35 points or more at Twickenham 13 times in the Six Nations, but they will not lack motivation against Wales.\nThere is little to separate Ireland, England and Wales who are all capable of beating each other home or away. It all comes down to the day itself and the coaching team that prevails tactically. The one that goes furthest in the World Cup will be the team, including New Zealand, that is able to adjust on the hoof and make itself heard above the noise.\n This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Malek had been under consideration for some time, but Variety had reported in December that his work schedule on the final season of Mr Robot, the TV series in which he plays a computer hacker with an anxiety disorder, meant he was unable to do both. Now, however, it appears he will be accommodated.\nProducers are also reported to be attempting to persuade another Oscar winner, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, to join the film.\nThe delays that have hit the troubled production may have worked in Malek\u2019s favour, as the studio shoot is now set to begin in April, under the working title Shatterhand. The film\u2019s release date has been pushed back to April 2020 amid reports of extensive script rewrites. Bourne Ultimatum writer Scott Z Burns has been hired to rework the screenplay. Original director Danny Boyle dropped out in August 2018 after \u201ccreative differences\u201d with the producers, and there have since been script drafts by Paul Haggis and the series\u2019 writing team Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.\nFew details have emerged about the villain role, but French-Moroccan actor Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui said in 2018 he had been approached to play it, though the ethnic identity of the character had not been established at that stage. It is also thought that Boyle clashed with producers over his plan to cast Cold War star Tomasz Kot as the lead villain. Malek, both of whose parents emigrated from Egypt to the US, is on record as choosing to reject roles that portray \u201cArabs or Middle Easterners in a negative light\u201d after a bad experience on the TV series 24.",

Rallies have also demanded recognition of the right of Palestinian refugees in Gaza and elsewhere to return to their ancestral homes in Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s army has said its forces opened fire to protect against attacks and incursions. Four of its troops have been injured during the protests, and one soldier was killed by a bullet fired from Gaza.\nThe UN inquiry also found fault with the protest organisers, which include Gaza\u2019s rulers, Hamas, for allowing the use of kites and balloons carrying cans of flaming petrol that have floated into Israel during rallies and torched fields.\nThose acts caused fear among civilians and significant damage to property in southern Israel, the panel said.\nThe demonstrations continue, but the inquiry only investigated possible violations from the start of the protests on 30 March to the end of 2018. It conducted 325 interviews with victims and witnesses, it said, and analysed social media and audio-visual material, including drone footage.\nIsraeli authorities did not respond to repeated requests for information and access, the panel said.\nYisrael Katz, Israel\u2019s acting foreign minister, said on Thursday that the investigation was \u201canother hostile, mendacious and slanted report against the State of Israel\u201d.\n\u201cNo one can deny Israel the right of self-defence and the obligation to defend its citizens and borders from violent attacks,\u201d he said.\nA fuller report will be presented to the human rights council in Geneva on 18 March.",

However, the numbers are shifting and more Tories could add their support to the people\u2019s vote campaign.\nLabour\u2019s Brexit blueprint was defeated by 323 votes to 240 in the Commons on Wednesday night and Corbyn confirmed Labour would now back a referendum if faced with a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d or a no-deal departure from the European Union.\n\n But he insisted that Labour would also continue to support \u201cother available options\u201d to prevent either the prime minister\u2019s deal or the UK crashing out without an agreement.\nOn ITV\u2019s Peston, the shadow chancellor set out Labour\u2019s approach, saying the move would be made when May next risks a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal. \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the time when we will have to put the amendment up,\u201d he said.\nThe party was willing to do what it can to ensure that the consequences of a no-deal Brexit were avoided, he added: \u201cWe have argued in our manifesto that we\u2019ll respect the referendum but that we would not allow Theresa May to inflict upon us a reckless Brexit deal \u2026 That would be catastrophic for our economy.\u201d\nHe dismissed Peston\u2019s claims that there were slim chances of passing the amendment, arguing that MPs were worried about jobs and would consider voting alongside Labour.\nMcDonnell said: \u201cThere is a chance we could win it, and I\u2019ll tell you why. People are worried about their constituencies, they\u2019re worried about jobs, they are worried about the economy.\u201d He added: \u201cEither a deal will go through which will protect jobs and the economy or, to get some deal through, it will be conditional on going back to the people.\u201d\nIf a second referendum took place, he confirmed he would back remain for a second time.

It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people \u2013 and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.\nCan we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\n\u201c[People] haven\u2019t quite adapted to concrete,\u201d she says, arguing that her work as an urban gardener doesn\u2019t just help the environment but improves wellbeing, too.\nAntipathy to the \u201cconcrete jungle\u201d is rooted in the assumption that concrete-heavy environments are by nature detrimental to psychological health. One study of more than 4 million Swedes, published in 2004 in the British Journal of Psychiatry, seemed to suggest that moving from a rural to an urban environment had a detrimental effect on individuals\u2019 mental health. Researchers at Exeter University, meanwhile, have used data from the British Household Panel Survey to show that mental health is improved in the long term by moving to greener areas.\nAnd in 1985, Alice Coleman, a geographer at King\u2019s College London, took the theory so far as to publish Utopia on Trial, in which she sought to lay the blame for antisocial behaviour and crime on the design of 1960s modernist estates. She even got a tower block knocked down in outer Birmingham and replaced with a village green in order to show that it would \u201cimprove\u201d the estate it stood in.\nIt is true that, having grown up on a 1960s estate, I remember feeling oppressed by the literal hardness of the environment, in spite of its relatively rich landscaping and nearby park. I couldn\u2019t escape a sense that the road, the pavement and the blocks of flats were, most of the time at least, the same colour as the sky: concrete-grey.\nBut perhaps the cause of my ill content, wasn\u2019t concrete, per se?  Has the material been made a bogeyman for the urban environment \u2013 assumed to be harsh and unforgiving, rather than liberating and inclusive \u2013 when many of the problems it seems to embody are more directly related to how inequality and segregation manifest in cities?\nJohn Grindrod, author of Concretopia, about Britain\u2019s postwar rebuilding effort, and Outskirts, on the green belts surrounding British cities, interviewed his brother Ian about the \u201cvery moment\u201d Ian developed agoraphobia. The family had just moved from an inner London block of flats to a maisonette on a relatively bucolic estate right at the edge of the city. Ian hated the change: \u201cI remember it, having to walk backwards under a tree because it was too big. Too much sky. So much sky!\u201d\nIndeed, far from condemning concrete, Concretopia was a full-blooded celebration of the material. What Grindrod\u2019s brother was lamenting was, effectively, the segregation of working-class council tenants from private homeowners. Throughout the postwar era, working-class city dwellers were systematically dispersed to peripheral areas as though it were a banishment, an enforced quarantine for which no mod cons could compensate.\nIndeed, Coleman\u2019s attempt to blame modernism for crime was almost immediately debunked by researchers who showed that low levels of wellbeing and social cohesion were also found on greener, prewar cottage estates. Poverty and social segregation, they argued, were the real culprits.\nThe wellbeing assumption itself was firmly challenged as recently as a 2018 article in the journal Health & Place that examined whether mental health was improved by programmes designed to make neighbourhoods \u201cnicer\u201d \u2013 that is, with less concrete. It found no evidence of \u201can effect on mental health from \u2018urban regeneration\u2019 and \u2018improving green infrastructure\u2019\u201d initiatives. Still, the conflict rages on.\nIn 1983, the architect James Dunnett wrote of his former employer Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger\u2019s high-rise Balfron Tower in east London that it evoked a \u201cdelicate sense of terror\u201d, and speculated that the Hungarian architect \u201chad chosen as a source of inspiration the artifacts of war\u201d.\nMy husband lived in Balfron\u2019s accompanying block Carradale House for several years, and my memories of that time are annotated by the sound of the wind whistling through great gaps in the windows and the neverending rush of cars along the Blackwall Tunnel approach.\nI can vouch for feeling a delicate sense of terror when visiting Carradale in the late 1990s: for example, when presented with human poo in the only working lift, or seeing local children negotiate used nappies and broken bottles in the play area outside. These are hazards relating to situations where hundreds of people live cheek-by-jowl but often don\u2019t see each other from one day to the next \u2013 and that itself has less to do with concrete and more to do with a concatenation of postwar planning decisions.\nThis small area of London\u2019s East End was ruined more thoroughly by the building of roads than of council flats, though both relied on concrete. Balfron, Carradale and the approach roads were all completed between 1967 and 1973, creating a new swath of the city where community life became secondary to the rapid movement of traffic. The nearby Aberfeldy estate, today being redeveloped with a high proportion of private rented housing, is even more trapped in space, hemmed in by congested A-roads. It is in areas like this where the accumulation of concrete, in the form of roads, flyovers, subways or flats, poses the greatest threat to wellbeing.\nBirmingham\u2019s Inner Ring Road, the scorched-earth centrepiece of the city\u2019s urban motorway system, showed signs of concrete decay as early as 1977, while the adjoining Gravelly Hill Interchange \u2013 better known as Spaghetti Junction \u2013 was met with anti-pollution demonstrations soon after its opening in 1972. A year later, the incoming editor of the Architects\u2019 Journal, Lance Wright, lambasted \u201cbadly fitting buildings [with] grotty concrete steps, cheap, twisting aluminium trim, rough precast concrete panels, like giants\u2019 breakfast food\u201d that contributed to a sense that much of the the postwar landscape was moulded on the cheap.\nYet, as Grindrod points out, in the lean decades after the war, concrete was often used experimentally to build urgently needed housing, and in direct response to shortages of traditional materials and skilled labour.\nOthers go further, arguing that the legacy of concrete is nothing short of the success of the welfare state, reliant as it was on a creative and transformative physical infrastructure. \u201cIf you look at early 20th-century rates of child mortality in Birmingham \u2013 these things saved lives,\u201d says Otto Saumarez Smith, a historian of postwar British planning at Warwick University, of concrete buildings. \u201cNebulous ideas about \u2018community\u2019 look small compared to that.\u201d\nThis is the point: getting people housed in better conditions was a job that had to be done. \u201cAt the time, a lot of people didn\u2019t necessarily believe that they were long-term solutions,\u201d says Grindrod of the huge 1960s estates he and I lived on. \u201cThey were seen as stopgaps to getting somewhere \u2013 they weren\u2019t designed to be there in 400 years.\u201d The same goes for now-desirable Victorian terrace houses. Balfron Tower, with its bespoke concrete design, is today being turned into luxury housing.\nIf improving physical health was the great public health challenge of the 20th century, then improving mental health will be the challenge of the 21st. We know that\u2019s not going to happen without a greater measure of equality, which has nothing to do with concrete. As cities across the world continue to expand to accommodate ever more people, rapid building methods and prefabrication are often needed to deal with problems that have more to do with entrenched poverty and spatial inequality than with the methods \u2013 and the material \u2013 we prefer to demonise.\nBarnabas Calder, a senior lecturer in architectural history at Liverpool University and the author of Raw Concrete (2016), a history of brutalism, believes it is the socioeconomic position of the people who use buildings that really matters when it comes to how different kinds of architecture are valued.\n\u201cIf you obliged social housing tenants to live in Blenheim Palace they would rightly complain, but if you put the Duke of Marlborough in it he would do just fine,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause he has the money to make a civilised living environment anywhere. Whereas poverty can make anywhere a living hell.\u201d\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

        "content": "The building material has improved some aspects of public health, but it is also linked to a host of respiratory and musculoskeletal problems\nMichael has worked with concrete for 27 years. His job involves \u201cbreaking out\u201d walls and floors, mixing concrete, injection work and drilling. These days, he suffers from chronic breathlessness, has had a cough for around three years and struggles to walk long distances. It is suspected that an emphysema-like condition called silicosis is to blame. Thanks to early-onset arthritis, he\u2019s had both knees replaced. He\u2019s 49.\nThough it might not be obvious to the millions of people who spend their days surrounded by this apparently innocuous material, concrete costs the health \u2013 and often the lives \u2013 of thousands of construction workers every year. The chief culprit is silica dust, which hangs in the air on building sites. Without proper protection, it can, over many years in the trade, scar the lungs and lead to silicosis, which is associated with chronic wheezing, arthritis, cancer and reduced life expectancy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a death sentence hanging over you,\u201d says Michael. \u201cIt affects me, it affects my family, it affects everything, you know what I mean?\u201d\nThis week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.\nOur species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.\nConcrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China.

In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.\nChris Michael, Cities editor\nConcrete is modernity\u2019s foundation stone: it surrounds us in bridges, motorways, tunnels, hospitals, stadiums and churches \u2013 from the Roman Pantheon, which is what God might pour if he had a concrete mixer, to Clifton Cathedral in Bristol, which looks like the ashtray where he would stub out his cigarettes. From the roads that carry medicines to the sewage pipes that whisk away waste, from the dams that deliver drinking water on tap to the walls that provide shelter and warmth, modern life as we know it is unimaginable without concrete\u2019s stability, durability, sterility and relative cheapness. But what impact does this ultra-hard, ultra-durable substance have on our soft human bodies?\nIt can certainly transform public health for the better. In 2000, Mexico\u2019s Coahuila state launched an initiative called Piso Firme (\u201cfirm floor\u201d), which involved pouring concrete floors for low-income households that had previously been forced to make do with dirt. The aim was to reduce hookworm disease \u2013 a parasitic infection contracted by walking barefoot on soil, where hookworm larvae burrow in through skin and wind up in the digestive tract, stunting children\u2019s growth and affecting their schooling.\nOnce the new floors had been installed, children in concreted homes experienced a 78% drop in parasite infection rates, while anaemia plummeted by 80%, diarrhoea fell by half and test scores improved dramatically. By 2005, 10% of Mexico\u2019s dirt-floor houses had made the switch to concrete. Even in the developed world its nonreactive nature makes concrete the ideal allergy-friendly floor surface, performing better for respiratory ailments than carpet, tile and floorboard, which harbour dust mites, bacteria, germs and mildew.\nWhen it comes to negative impacts, perhaps the first thing to consider is our joints. The surfaces humanity traversed as it evolved were far more forgiving than those we now spend much of our time on. Conditions suffered by factory workers perhaps offer the clearest example of concrete\u2019s effects on the feet, knees and hips: many manufacturing jobs involve standing for long periods on hard floor, day after day, week in, week out.\n\u201cA lot of patients come through our doors who work in heavy engineering,\u201d says Andrew Cumming at the Royal Orthopaedic hospital (ROH) in Birmingham. \u201cThere are some large car factories around the West Midlands and the Black Country, and we get a lot of people who stand on a track, working eight-, nine-, 10-hour shifts. That\u2019s where we see our classic heel-pain person come in. It can have a knock-on effect on other [musculoskeletal] structures, too.\u201d\nThe most common complaint is plantar fasciitis, a painful inflammation of the band of tissue that runs across the bottom of the foot, connecting the heel to the toes. Cumming can prescribe stretching, steroid injections and shockwave therapy, but any treatment is unlikely to be effective without workers being allowed to sit down or take a break from the concrete. \u201cSometimes people have to change career,\u201d he says.\nCumming gets referrals from two other professions that spend a lot of time walking and standing on concrete: teaching and nursing. \u201cAnecdotally, the concrete wards and floors in hospitals could be a problem,\u201d he says.\nHealth and safety advice worldwide takes it as read that concrete floors cause ailments as diverse as varicose veins, achilles tendonitis and osteoarthritis. An entire industry has grown up around anti-fatigue matting, which, it is thought, mitigates tiredness by requiring constant microadjustments in balance.\nThe science on the subject, however, is inconclusive. Scientists at Loughborough University found that standing for as little as 90 minutes on concrete \u201ccaused serious discomfort to the feet, legs and back of the study participants\u201d along with stiffness of the neck and shoulders; another study showed hard floors increased the risk of plantar fasciitis at assembly plants.\nBut in 2002 a review of all the literature in the field found \u201cno unequivocal support\u201d for the effects of cumulative industrial trauma on seven conditions of the foot and ankle, including plantar fasciitis. Although it is known that concrete floors cause lameness in cattle, leading to \u201cjoint swelling and body lesions, as well as abnormalities in resting behaviour and postural changes\u201d, more research into its effect on humans is needed.\nSeeming to support the link between concrete and injury is the experience of another major group with orthopaedic problems: runners. \u201cThe contrast between treadmill runners and concrete runners is really quite marked,\u201d says Cumming. Patient numbers swell at the ROH after Christmas, when a wave of erstwhile athletes join running clubs with new year enthusiasm.\nNick Anderson, lead marathon trainer for the England athletics team, strictly limits the number of miles his clients do on concrete. \u201cWe do see more injury issues with the road than with running on trails,\u201d he says. \u201cI tend to get runners to do only about 30-40% on the roads \u2013 the rest will be on trails or softer ground. Road running is important but it will speed up injury rates because it\u2019s a hard surface.\u201d\nAnderson says it is acknowledged in the running world \u2013 from coaches to physios to the athletes themselves \u2013 that concrete wreaks havoc on the joints. \u201cWe coach people getting ready for the Olympics, and a lot of world-class athletes running big volumes do most of their weekly training off-road,\u201d he says. \u201cRoad running\u2019s fantastic \u2013 I\u2019m not against it, I love it. But I\u2019m always trying to get runners to train on a multitude of surfaces, just to reduce to stress that the body is having to deal with all the time.\u201d\nThe very evenness of the surface can also present a problem. \u201cIf the road is flat, often you get what I would call overuse biomechanical injuries, because you recreate the same foot plant all the time,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cUltimately, though, it all ends up in the lower back, because everything in terms of the shock and stress will transfer upwards.\u201d\nThe science, again, is not conclusive. \u201cThe relationship between impact loads and concrete surfaces is conflicting,\u201d says Toby Smith, technical lead physiotherapist at the English Institute of Sport, which provides support to the Olympic and Paralympic squads. \u201cThe literature indicates that muscle activity, running speed and technique have a greater influence on joint loads than the type of surface. In essence, it\u2019s more about how the runner interacts with a surface rather than type of surface which influences the joint loads.\u201d\nBut the respiratory problems on building sites and in cities around the world remain \u2013 and there is no lack of scientific consensus about those.\nConcrete is a mixture of three components: water; \u201caggregates\u201d such as gravel, sand or crushed rock; and cement, which acts as a binding agent. The cement causes many issues: it is highly toxic, prompting eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and contains calcium oxide, corrosive to human tissue, and chromium, which can prompt severe allergic reactions.\nThen there\u2019s silica. Naturally present in the Earth\u2019s crust in sand and quartz, this material assumes its lethal form of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) dust during heavy industrial processes like cutting, drilling, blasting and demolition. Independently of silicosis, RCS can also lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, tuberculosis and kidney disease.\nLung cancer caused by long-term dust exposure kills an average of 789 UK workers every year \u2013 or roughly 15 a week. Whereas it was previously thought that this type of cancer was caused by silicosis, silica dust itself is now recognised as a carcinogenic substance.\nProf Sir Anthony Newman Taylor of Imperial College\u2019s National Heart and Lung Institute says: \u201cI think there\u2019s sufficient evidence that silica itself is carcinogenic. And if you say that, then there can be no threshold [for safe exposure].\u201d\nSince silica\u2019s dangers came to light, the UK government\u2019s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has pushed construction bosses to take a tighter approach to protective equipment, launched awareness campaigns such as Go Home Healthy, and published extensive safety information online.\nDespite this, many say the HSE\u2019s stance on workplace silica is not strict enough. The UK\u2019s current legal limit for silica exposure is 0.1mg/m\u00b3, averaged over an eight-hour shift. The US, however, recently halved its legal limit to 0.05mg/m\u00b3 after extensive lobbying by its own health and safety body, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nThe HSE says it cannot replicate this better standard due to the costs and technical difficulties involved \u2013 even though its own literature shows that six times as many workers are at risk of silicosis over a 45-year career at 0.1mg/m\u00b3 than with 0.05mg/m\u00b3. Meanwhile, jurisdictions like Portugal and British Columbia enforce even lower limits of 0.025mg/m\u00b3 \u2013 a quarter of the UK limit. Germany has gone one step further, reclassifying silica dust as a carcinogen and minimising exposure altogether.\nMeanwhile, Michael, the construction worker, paints a picture of an industry ignorant of silica\u2019s long-term effects. \u201cIt\u2019s only recently that they really enforced masks and things like that,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout 10 years ago they started pushing for it \u2013 but sometimes you didn\u2019t have the equipment, so it wasn\u2019t an option. You just had to carry on.\u201d\nHe believes there are others at his firm showing the symptoms of silicosis. \u201cOh, there\u2019s a good 25 of us that have been there over 25 years. And I would say most of them are good suspects of having it. And that\u2019s just one company.\u201d\nHe\u2019s currently waiting for final confirmation that the scarring on his lungs revealed by x-rays is indeed silicosis, although he says he \u201calready half-knows\u201d.\nMichael\u2019s advice to younger workers? \u201cForce the issue. Physically ask for the mask before you do anything, because if you don\u2019t ask for it, they\u2019ll let you crack on and use drills and grinders \u2013 because they know that in a year there\u2019s going to be a completely different gang of workers in there.\u201d\nGuardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

        "content": "Charities are reaping the benefits of these modern-day telethons as video game players fundraise live on the internet\nThere has been a quiet revolution in the world of philanthropy over recent years, driven by the fact that sitting down to play a video game until you fall over from sleep deprivation can raise thousands or even millions of dollars for charity \u2013 as long as you do it live on the internet.\n\u201cThe impact is big and getting bigger,\u201d says Jeremy Wells, fundraising events manager for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a popular partner for charity streams. \u201cSummer Games Done Quick is our biggest fundraiser of the year \u2013 it brought in $2.1m last year out of $4.7m for our whole events program.\u201d\nCharity streaming is similar to old-school telethons or donation drives: streamers broadcast themselves playing games live on the internet while urging viewers to donate to charity. Games Done Quick \u2013 a twice-a-year multiday showcase where speedrunners utilise technical knowledge, well-honed skills and physics-defying glitches to race through games as fast as possible \u2013 is one of the scene\u2019s biggest events. But it\u2019s far from the only charity stream out there. Streaming platform Twitch estimates between 2012 and 2017, more than $75m was raised for various charities on its service alone.\nPossibly the first ever charity live stream was Desert Bus for Hope, which happened in November 2007 (although record-keeping from the early days of streaming is extremely spotty).\nDesert Bus is an endurance grind for a team playing the world\u2019s most tedious minigame \u2013 driving a slightly broken bus on a boring, real-time eight-hour virtual trip from Tucson to Las Vegas and back \u2013 for as long as viewers keep donating. With events held every year since that first stream, it has raised more than $5m for the children\u2019s hospital charity Child\u2019s Play.\n\u201cWe named it the \u2018first annual Desert Bus for Hope\u2019 as a joke,\u201d says James Turner, one of the members from comedy troupe and Desert Bus founders LoadingReadyRun. \u201cWe had zero intention of ever doing it again \u2026 but it took off!\u201d\n\u201cUstream was the service we used that first few years of Desert Bus,\u201d explains Turner. \u201cThere was no overlay, no graphics \u2026 back then, we would run two separate streams: one camera pointed at us, and one of the actual game.\u201d\nIn the days before mass adoption of Twitter or tools such as Skype or FaceTime, links were shared through blogs and websites while audience interaction was through internet relay chat clients or through actual phone calls held up to a microphone. That first year, they streamed for more than four days straight and raised $22,000.\nToday, like other juggernaut streaming events, Desert Bus has turned into a large-scale production with schedules and volunteers. But the barrier to entry for streaming \u2013 and charity streaming in particular \u2013 has lowered dramatically: an internet connection and a decent PC is usually enough for just about anyone to stream online. Dedicated organisations, too, have jumped on board; donation handlers such as Tiltify and GoFundMe help with payment management and verification, while platforms such as YouTube Giving, Facebook Live or Twitch help integrate metrics and donation buttons straight into the show.\nWhile mega-streams such as Games Done Quick and, more recently, Hbomberguy\u2019s star-studded celebrity stream for trans youth tend to attract the most cash and attention, donations raised by smaller streams with viewers in the hundreds or even dozens still add up.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just one person who streams a little bit, and their friends watch and donate some,\u201d says Wells. \u201cIt\u2019s very grassroots, very reactive.\u201d\nLive streaming\u2019s closest ancestors include telethons like the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day marathons or PBS pledge drives. \u201cCertainly in all our heads that was an inspiration,\u201d says Turner. \u201cThat was something we grew up with, and we took that formula and put it on the internet.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a show for a cause,\u201d notes Wells. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing people together under one activity, using modern tech, but with the same old methodology.\u201d\nSome charity organisations such as Extra Life keep leaderboards, encouraging different groups to tap their fanbases and compete for rankings. Other streams set donation goals which, if reached, will require the streamer to do something \u2013 often something difficult, boring, embarrassing or gross.\nDesert Bus operates on similar principles: the first hour of virtual driving costs $1, but the amount required for the next hour increases exponentially by 7% every hour. Last year Desert Bus ran for 160 hours, meaning the last few hours required nearly a million dollars in donations each. \u201cWe knew we needed that built-in escape hatch so that we couldn\u2019t just be there forever,\u201d laughs Turner.\nCharities see a range of benefits to this \u201cgeek philanthropy\u201d (aside from the revenue), not least of which is exposure to a wider audience. \u201cThe Harry Potter association was doing some fundraisers for Doctors Without Borders. My Little Pony conventions, too,\u201d says Wells. \u201cI give Games Done Quick credit for getting us on board and making us realise that this was something to look for and develop in the future.\u201d\n\u201cOur average donor, historically, is in their mid-60s,\u201d Wells adds. \u201cAnd the average streamer is not. It\u2019s still considered a new channel to engage people \u2013 people who aren\u2019t in that world, who haven\u2019t watched or heard of Twitch before, they really don\u2019t comprehend it until they can see it happen.\u201d\nRetention is a challenge for charities, with donors less likely to sign up for recurring donations. \u201cBut I see people every year giving their annual gift at Summer Games Done Quick, and that\u2019s recurring,\u201d says Wells. \u201cSometimes we think that we need to move people into the channels that we\u2019re comfortable with [like direct mail or telephone]. But this channel is fine; we just have to develop it to be more robust.\u201d\nStreamers, too, benefit from associations with charity, as with any sponsor, corporate or otherwise. Charity streaming has become a part of PR campaigns for upcoming or already popular games, while individual streamers often find it an avenue for major profile boosts or even a way to deflect criticism. Controversial streamer Felix \u201cPewDiePie\u201d Kjellberg, for example, has raised substantial amounts through live streams for various charities including Save the Children and the HIV/Aids support organisation (RED).\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s going to do a stream, raise some money and support our work, that\u2019s fabulous,\u201d says Wells. \u201cBut if we\u2019re working directly with someone, we try and keep mature-rated games off the board. And we ask that people keep the stream decent \u2013 though people can interpret that in different ways.\u201d\nMSF is also working to incorporate and apply the lessons learned from streaming to other aspects of fundraising. \u201cWe\u2019re about to publish a streaming toolkit that will help with overlays and content and donation alerts and infographics,\u201d says Wells. \u201cBut we\u2019re also reaching out to our traditional peer-to-peer fundraisers to try and add a streaming element.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a kid\u2019s charity concert, for instance, they can turn on Facebook Live and raise money with the grandparents who are 2,000 miles away,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt really opens up fundraising and streaming to a lot of different crowds.\u201d\nTurner, meanwhile, is glad to have been there at the start of it all. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that I am most proud of, of anything that I\u2019ve done in my life, and I think that\u2019s true for pretty much anybody else on the team,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to sit here and say every single charity marathon exists because we started Desert Bus \u2013 this was an idea that was going to happen regardless, that was just where technology was taking us.\n\u201cBut knowing that we played even a little bit of a small part feels really good.\u201d",

        "content": "A boy takes up ballet in 1960s South Dakota, in this bruising novel about siblings, self-destruction and survivor guilt\nThe family is a complex collective: no matter how far from it we roam, or how radically we transform ourselves, we can\u2019t cut loose from our origins. We are who we are partly because of how we were raised, and who we were raised with. Often, within families, there is a parent or brother or sister around whom all the other members of the family cannot but shape themselves. In Paula Saunders\u2019s debut novel, a tale of a family in crisis against the unlikely backdrop of ballet studios in 1960s South Dakota, this role is played by Leon, half of the brother-sister duo at its heart.\nThe patriarch is Al, a cattle dealer, who much prefers his daughter Rene to his son Leon. Rene is driven, sharp, self-sufficient. Leon is the opposite, at least as a child: patient, pliable, stammering. Their mother Eve, a homemaker and seamstress who eventually opens a small ballet studio of her own, dotes on Leon. When she signs him up for tap dancing lessons, we know it is not going to end well.\nNot surprisingly, Al hates that his son is dancing \u2013 and his disgust grows when Leon switches to ballet. Rene takes up ballet too, and both children discover themselves in dance, but this is cattle country, hardscrabble and haunted by violence. (At the local Native American museum, alongside the beaded moccasins and leather loincloths, there are \u201cold black-and-white photos of Indians frozen in pools of their own blood\u201d.) It\u2019s not a world that, 60 years ago, could easily accommodate a boy in tights: the teachers and kids start calling Leon \u201chomo\u201d, \u201cfreak\u201d, \u201cqueer\u201d. Things unravel quickly: by the age of 15, he\u2019s in deep trouble. Rene, meanwhile, is thriving, if at the expense of friendships. She does nothing halfheartedly \u2013 whether heading the cheerleading squad or briefly joining the evangelicals \u2013 and her \u201cwill to excel\u201d arouses the envy and hatred of her classmates.\nOne of the questions this novel poses is how to live with the knowledge that you have failed to save a sibling from the world\u2019s evils or from self-destruction. In a moment of survivor guilt, Rene muses: \u201cShe must have done the same to Leon as she\u2019d done to her classmates \u2026 eclipsed and overstepped him without even bothering to look. But the world wasn\u2019t tender-hearted or willing to hit the dirt, as her older brother had been.\u201d\nMost of the novel is set during Rene and Leon\u2019s childhood, and Saunders, who is married to novelist and short story writer George Saunders, is strong on the shifting sands of family life: the loyalties and betrayals, how anger and love get all mixed up, the way absent fathers can enjoy an undeserved affection. After Al violently beats his son, then takes to the road, Saunders writes: \u201cAl was around only as a kind of gift, showing up now and again just as Rene was beginning to wonder if she\u2019d ever see him again, and it was Eve she hated for Leon\u2019s beating.\u201d\nThe family is an ever-evolving organism, and this one is no different. Resentments burn themselves out, new avenues for understanding open up, usually when it\u2019s too late. As the novel progresses, we get glimpses of the future \u2013 snapshots of time Saunders drops in that leapfrog years and land us in the distant aftermath of all that originary mess and heartache. I am sorry she doesn\u2019t delve more deeply into Rene and Leon\u2019s adult lives, for when she does there is a power and poignancy that is sometimes lacking in the childhood narrative.\nNovelists often balk at being asked to explain to what extent a novel corresponds to their real lives. In a letter accompanying the book\u2019s publicity material, Saunders has provided a sort of artist\u2019s statement addressing that question: her father was a cattle trader, she and her brother were serious students of ballet in South Dakota, her brother\u2019s life went off the rails. She hopes that, by excavating the love that coexisted alongside the hurt in her family, the novel might \u201cbenefit the hearts\u201d of those who read it.\nSuch a declaration raises the question of whether novels \u2013 and readers \u2013 are best served when a novelist\u2019s aim is to \u201cilluminate a path\u201d by which we might take a fresh look at their \u201cmost difficult experiences\u201d. We tend to think of that as the job of another kind of book. While novels can certainly open eyes and change lives, the self-help impulse may be a problematic starting point.\nWhatever a writer has in mind while writing, a novel sinks or swims according to its merits. There were stories in The Distance Home that I wanted more of, and others I wanted less of, and I sometimes wished the book had been written as a memoir. Freed of the burden of plotting, the sheer, raw power of this family\u2019s story \u2013 so unusual in its context and emblematic in its agonies \u2013 might have been plumbed to its depths. The moments when that was achieved made me yearn for more.\n Molly McCloskey\u2019s When Light Is Like Water is out in paperback (Penguin). The Distance Home is published by Picador (\u00a314.99).

        "content": "Belligerent and dismissive, the ranking member of the House oversight committee took on a Trump-like role\nFrom the first words of his opening statement, Jim Jordan, top Republican on the House oversight committee, set the tone for his party\u2019s approach to Michael Cohen: belligerent, dismissive and utterly uninterested in anything Donald Trump\u2019s private lawyer for the past decade had to say.\n\u201cMr Chairman, here we go,\u201d the congressman from Ohio spat out in front of a packed committee chamber, having stripped down to his white shirt and yellow tie to signal he meant business. \u201cYour first big hearing, your first announced witness, Michael Cohen \u2026 a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress.\u201d\nJordan adopted a strategy in Wednesday\u2019s high-profile grilling of Cohen that closely echoed Trump\u2019s own stance towards the multiple investigations that now besiege him: bully your assailant into submission. With a grin on his face, Jordan asked Cohen how long he had worked in the White House, knowing full well that the lawyer never had.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point isn\u2019t it, Mr Cohen? You wanted to work at the White House. You didn\u2019t get brought to the dance.\u201d\nJordan proved himself not just to be Trump\u2019s bully-in-chief for the purposes of congressional hearings, he also matched the US president\u2019s affection for conspiracy theories. He accused the Democratic leadership of the oversight committee of taking orders from Lanny Davis, Cohen\u2019s current attorney who is a figure of hatred among rightwing Republicans, having been Bill Clinton\u2019s special counsel in the 1990s.\n\u201cLanny Davis choreographed the whole darn thing, the Clintons\u2019 best friend,\u201d he said.\nJordan\u2019s pugnacious performance lit up social media, though not for reasons he would have liked. The representative for Ohio\u2019s fourth congressional district trended on Twitter as users posted articles reporting allegations that he had failed to take action against the sexual molestation of students while working as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio state university from 1986 to 1994.\nLast April, the university announced that it was investigating claims that the team\u2019s longstanding doctor, the late Richard Strauss, had sexually abused team members over years. Several former wrestlers have come forward to allege that Jordan knew about what was being done to them but did nothing to stop it.\nTypical of the Twitter storm was a post from Christine Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughter:\nIF ONLY Jim Jordan was as outraged at the sexual abuse of wrestling students on his watch as he is at COHEN for revealing the corruption of Donald Trump. #Shame https://t.co/1Uuln2gCdh\nJordan\u2019s one-track approach \u2013 character assassination for Cohen without addressing any of the claims leveled by him against the president \u2013 was puzzling even to some other conservatives. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and Trump adviser, wondered on Fox News why none of his Republican colleagues on the panel had tried to defend Trump on any points of substance.\n\u201cThat\u2019s either a failure of the Republicans on the Hill or of the White House: they knew what was coming with Michael Cohen,\u201d Christie said.\nIn the outcome, Cohen gave as good as he got. \u201cShame on you, Mr Jordan,\u201d he said, after the ranking member had told the hearing that Cohen displayed \u201cnon-existent\u201d remorse.\n\u201cI am remorseful,\u201d Cohen went on. \u201cI am going to prison. I will be away from my wife and children for years.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that,\u201d Jordan said in a rare moment of connection.",

        "content": "(Relentless Records)Gruffly ordinary, featured on the Love Island soundtrack and boasting a Brit award, Walker seems algorithmically designed for our times\nIt would be hard to argue that the winner of this year\u2019s best British breakthrough Brit award is anything other than a very 2019 kind of pop star, and not merely because his route to success was bolstered by regular appearances on that noted barometer of public taste Love Island. The last series of the reality show deployed so many of Tom Walker\u2019s songs on its soundtrack that he might as well have been stalking the contestants around their Mallorcan shag-pad, popping up from behind bushes and out of wardrobes to serenade them.\nHe also seems to fit perfectly with at least one hugely important aspect of our era. We live in a world of recommendations cooked up by algorithms and data-crunching, of \u201cinspired by your recent activity\u201d playlists, of \u201cfor fans of\u201d, where the idea that your mind could be blown by something completely out of left-field, something that runs contrary to your established taste, seems to have been eradicated like smallpox. And there\u2019s certainly a distinct hint of \u201cif you like that, you\u2019ll love this\u201d about Tom Walker.\nHis backstory comes complete with tales of busking and sleeping rough, not unlike that of Ed Sheeran. He shares with Sheeran a co-writer \u2013 Steve Mac, of Shape of You fame \u2013 and a predilection for a percussive style of guitar playing, vaguely hip-hop beats and rap-influenced vocal cadences that ensured that his single Fly Away With Me was played not just on Radio 1, but 1Xtra. He also has a distinct hint of Sheeran\u2019s willingness to step into musical areas that common decency has long declared off limits, safe in the knowledge that public taste seldom chimes with what rock critics decree permissible: while Sheeran lucratively dabbled in Oirish fiddle-de-dee on Galway Girl, Walker\u2019s song Blessings sounds suspiciously like white reggae.\nAnd, as on Sheeran\u2019s debut album +, the songwriting on What a Time to Be Alive tends to bullish assertions of Walker\u2019s own talent in the face of apathy and adversity (\u201cI\u2019ll be dead before they change me, my guitar\u2019s the only one that ever paid me\u201d) and empathetic I\u2019m-your-mate vignettes involving booze, drugs and lean times. Walker\u2019s gruff voice means that the empathetic vignettes are rendered more in tears-of-a-tough-guy mode than Sheeran\u2019s patent aura of sweet-natured older brother expressing concern.\nIn fact, Walker\u2019s vocals are one major point of difference with Framlingham\u2019s most successful musical export. He has a very good voice if you like your furniture artfully distressed. He sings in a variation of that growly, slurry, prematurely aged, woke-up-this-mornin\u2019-and-my-woman-was-gone-from-our-halls-of-residence style popular with everyone from George Ezra to Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, a style he further decorates with eyebrow-raising swoops into a Sam Smith-y falsetto, as on his duet with Zara Larsson, Now You\u2019re Gone. Another is his vastly more expansive production style. A raft of big-name producers have worked on What a Time to Be Alive, all of them clearly commissioned to come up with music designed to fill stadiums. They take a variety of approaches to fulfilling this brief: Arctic Monkeys circa AM grind on Cry Out, EDM synths on My Way, echoing U2 guitars on How Can You Sleep at Night? and cinematic orchestration on Fade Away.\nAt the risk of sounding cynical, if you were an A&R person, you would probably sign him. In the current climate, where mainstream success feels predicated on fitting in, he seems like a sure thing, an amalgam of current styles: everything on What a Time to Be Alive sounds like a hit, in that you can imagine it slotting smoothly into the singles chart without ruffling any feathers. In an age obsessed with pop stars being as ordinary as possible, he has everyman appeal, underlined by the album\u2019s cover, a drawing of Walker, made up of other people: thousands of tiny figures depicting the singer, in beard and beanie.\nHe\u2019s also skilled at writing songs that adeptly push emotional buttons without scaring anyone off: the fact that his big hit Leave a Light On is about drug addiction didn\u2019t stop it being used on an advert for upmarket TVs, or re-recorded with skirling backing by the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, kilt-favouring winners of BBC1\u2019s talent show When Will I Be Famous? You can scoff at that as a minor skill if you want, but let\u2019s check Tom Walker\u2019s bank balance in 18 months\u2019 time and see who\u2019s laughing then. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t seem like such a guaranteed success if it felt in some way risky or adventurous. As it is, the sense that absolutely nothing here has been left to chance \u2013 and that What a Time to Be Alive might have been a more interesting album if it had \u2013 is a tough one to avoid.\nBig Thief: UFOF\n  A song about alien abduction where the abductee sounds positively delighted to be kidnapped, this taster for Brooklyn band Big Thief\u2019s third album is hazily sunlit and beautiful.",

        "content": "Prize money negotiations are once more the cause of bitterness in horse racing and talk of boycotts of race-meeting persists\nAs you\u2019ll be aware, horse racing is once more wrestling itself in a bitter row over prize money. For an insight into how bitter, consider that Martin Cruddace, chief executive of ARC, has suggested to his staff that the horsemen are negotiating like a child. This is a paragraph taken from a message he sent out last week:\n\u201cSo our position is, we would like to give the \u00a34.5m to horsemen without paying the \u00a32.7m that it would cost to unlock in 2019 from February onwards. In a complete irony, the Horsemen are not agreeing and saying they will only accept the \u00a34.5m if we pay the \u00a32.7m. I remember my daughter applying similar negotiating principles on bedtime when she was 6!\u201d\nFeelings are clearly running high, though that has not prevented a stop-gap deal being agreed this morning, under which prize money levels will be maintained for the next month to allow a breathing space for further negotiation.\nWe don\u2019t yet know if that will be enough to avert a three-day boycott of racing at ARC-owned tracks planned for next week, including Fontwell on Wednesday, which would be the first jump-racing fixture to be affected by the row. But the difficulty of a boycott for low-profile trainers is shown by a couple of blog postings today by Jo Davis, based in Berkshire, and Katie Scott, in the Scottish Borders.\nDavis has been waiting for soft ground for one of her horses and expects to get it at Fontwell. Her owners, she reports, have told her: \u201cThey are not interested in a boycott, they are in it for the horse and the fun of racing, they all knew that if they purchased a racehorse they would be writing that money off and any return was a bonus ... I would love higher prize money but when you are at the bottom end of the sport and training low-grade horses, you know that it is rubbish ... If I lose one owner at the moment then I will be running at a loss.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Scott points out that the three all-weather tracks within reasonable distance of her yard are all run by ARC. \u201cWe have great races picked out next Friday at Newcastle for two of our team, the horses are well, ready to run and if we don\u2019t run there the next available races for those two horses within 300 miles and not at an ARC track are Ayr 1st April and Musselburgh 2nd April. Please tell me there\u2019s another way to do this, we work so hard to have these horses ready.\u201d\nTrainers led by Ralph Beckett want to send a clear message to ARC that the cuts being made to prize money at their tracks are not acceptable. ARC maintain that the cuts are necessary in view of an expected reduction in the income that racing receives from the betting industry.\nI\u2019ve been waiting for Benny\u2019s Secret (3.55) to come out again since the day seven weeks ago when he came up short by just a head in his second run over fences. I felt at the time that a more attacking ride would have got him home in front but perhaps that would have led him into making mistakes.\nAlas, we\u2019re not getting the 7-1 at which he started that day. He\u2019s a worthy 13-8 favourite against five rivals back at Musselburgh this afternoon.\nAt Ludlow, it\u2019s interesting that Kupatana has been moved from Nicky Henderson to Paul Nicholls while remaining in the ownership of Grech & Parkin. Jumping has let her down in her last three starts, including at this track, so I\u2019ll field against her today with Kayf Blanco (2.25) at 9-4.\nLater on that card, 13-2 looks fair about Calipso Collonges (3.35). He\u2019s unexposed over fences and the return to three miles could compensate for this being a drier surface than he usually tackles.\nMusselburgh\u00a01.35 Constancio 2.10 Samtu 2.45 Boy's On Tour 3.20 Ballynanty 3.55 Benny's\u00a0Secret (nap) 4.30 Highate Hill\u00a0Ludlow\u00a01.50 Snapdragon Fire 2.25 Kayf Blanco 3.00 Earlofthecotswolds 3.35 Calipso\u00a0Collonges 4.10 It's O Kay 4.45 Now Ben 5.15 HijranTaunton\u00a02.00 Regulation 2.35 Airton 3.10 Oscar Ceremony 3.45 Bastien 4.20 Colonial\u00a0Dreams 4.55 Master Baker 5.30 New Guard\u00a0Newcastle\u00a04.05 Glan Y Gors 4.40 Almost Midnight 5.10 Winged Spur 5.45 Treasure Me\u00a0(nb) 6.15 Portledge 6.45 Fendale 7.15 Wise Words\u00a0Kempton\u00a04.50 Solveig's Song 5.20 Jack Louie 5.55 Cashel 6.30 Creek Island 7.00\u00a0Astrospeed 7.30 Valentino Dancer 8.00 Blazon 8.30 The Detainee",

It followed tit-for-tat airstrikes this week that have led to the closure of dozens of airports and put major cities on high alert across the subcontinent.\nA report in Pakistan\u2019s Dawn newspaper on Thursday quoted witnesses who said he had fought off angry villagers with a pistol at the crash site and had tried to swallow and destroy maps and documents in his possession before he was taken into Pakistani custody.\nVideos released by Islamabad showed Varthaman being beaten by villagers near the crash site and then interrogated in a bloodied uniform. Both were widely shared on WhatsApp and social media.\nBy late evening, in footage that appeared to be aimed at calming public anger in India, the pilot was shown drinking tea and praising the way he was being treated by his captors, who he said were \u201cthorough gentlemen\u201d.\nThe Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, was addressing an audience at a science and technology prize soon after the news of the pilot\u2019s impending release was announced. He made reference to scientists needed to design pilot projects, before quipping: \u201cJust now one pilot project has been completed\u201d.\nThe clashes over the heavily militarised \u201cline of control\u201d that divides Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmirhave sparked calls for restraint from countries including the US, China, Russia and the UK.\nKhan\u2019s surprise announcement that he was releasing Varthaman, whose welfare has been a major concern in India, will put pressure on Delhi to reciprocate in a way that eases tensions.\nBut India will be reluctant to do so without extracting some demonstration from Pakistan that it is willing to crack down on Islamist militia groups operating on its soil \u2014 an issue that has largely been obscured in the past two days by fears the two nuclear powers may be sliding into war.\nSpeaking to reporters in Delhi on condition of anonymity, an Indian government official said he categorically rejected the idea that a conflict was imminent and accused Pakistan of creating a \u201cwar psychosis\u201d to distract from its sponsorship of militant groups.\nLeave was cancelled for health workers and police in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Wednesday night and emergency orders were issued in Karachi.\nIndia has been careful to characterise its air strikes in Pakistan on Tuesday morning as \u201ccounter-terrorism actions\u201d \u2014 language the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, adopted in his statement on the issue on Wednesday.\nThe US president, Donald Trump, who was addressing a press conference in Hanoi on Thursday morning, hinted that diplomatic efforts had begun behind the scenes.\n\u201cThey have been going at it and we have been involved,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have some reasonably decent news, hopefully it\u2019s going to be coming to an end, this has been going on for a long time, decades and decades.\u201d\nSpeaking before the announcement of Varthaman\u2019s impending release, Indian officials in Delhi said they were unsure what Trump had been referring to and said there was nothing to negotiate until Pakistan took credible and verifiable action against militant groups in the country.\nWho controls Kashmir?\nThe region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since\u00a0India\u00a0and Pakistan came into being in 1947.\nBoth claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.\nIndia and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.\nHow did the dispute start?\nAfter the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.\nKashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.\nIn 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.\nIn its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.\nWhat was Kashmir\u2019s special status?\nKashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u00a0\nAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.\nOn Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had\u00a0 only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.\nWhat do the militants want?\nThere has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.\nUntil 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u00a0extreme force\u00a0in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.\nFor Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe\nIndia has rallied France, the UK and the US behind a fresh proposal to have the UN security council add Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), to a terrorist watchlist.\nJeM claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Kashmir on 14 February that killed 40 Indian paramilitaries and triggered the current crisis. India responded to the attack on Tuesday by striking what it claims was a JeM training camp in Pakistan.\nChina has repeatedly blocked previous efforts to list Azhar as a terrorist, a move that would put pressure on its ally Pakistan to arrest the militant leader, who operates freely on its soil.\nDelhi accuses Islamabad of nurturing and assisting militant groups as a form of asymmetrical warfare against India, its larger and more powerful neighbour.",

        "content": "Nationwide says house prices dipped 0.1% in February from January to average of \u00a3211,304 \nThe London estate agent Foxtons slumped to its first annual loss since its stock market debut six years ago, blaming a further fall in the number of homes sold and warning of a prolonged downturn in the capital\u2019s property market.\nFoxtons, known for its hefty commissions and fleet of Mini Coopers, said low consumer confidence because of Brexit uncertainty, the impact of higher stamp duty introduced in 2016 and low affordability in London after years of rapid house price growth were weighing on the market.\nNic Budden, the chief executive, said: \u201c2018 was one of the toughest sales markets we have ever had in London, with transactions falling from [the previous] year\u2019s historically low levels.\u201d\nThe agency sold 2,529 properties last year, down 15%, with the average price of a Foxtons sale dipping to \u00a3581,000, from \u00a3582,000 in 2017.\nThe grim outlook came as Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society, said house prices dipped 0.1% in February from January to an average of \u00a3211,304, while the annual growth rate in prices edged up to 0.4% from 0.1%.\nRobert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cAfter almost grinding to a complete halt in January, annual house price growth remained subdued in February. Measures of consumer confidence weakened around the turn of the year and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries over the same period.\u201d\nFoxtons posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a317.2m for 2018, compared with a profit of \u00a36.5m the previous year. The loss reflected costs of \u00a315.7m related to the closure of six branches and a writedown in its sales division.\nSales revenues fell by 15% to \u00a336.2m in 2018, with the average revenue per transaction slipping to \u00a314,300. Total revenues, which also include mortgage broking, fell 5% to \u00a3111.5m, with better lettings partially cushioning the blow from the slump in the London sales market. Lettings revenues rose 1% to \u00a367m.\nThe annual loss and collapse in sales follows years of bumper profits and aggressive expansion after Foxtons\u2019 2013 stock market debut, marked by glossy branch openings in areas where prices were rising fast that prompted protestors to paint \u201cyuppies out!\u201d on the agency\u2019s windows.\nGarry Watts, the chairman, said: \u201cThe London sales market is in a prolonged downturn and the current uncertainty surrounding Brexit is clearly impacting consumer confidence.\u201d\nThis prompted Foxtons to shut branches in Beckenham, Enfield, Loughton, Ruislip, Park Lane and Barnes towards the end of last year but it said it has no plans for further closures. The agency, which was founded in Notting Hill in 1981, has 61 branches.\nTom Stevenson, the investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing\u2019s share dealing service, said: \u201cThe estate agency business is all about volumes. Once you have covered your basic fixed costs, every extra sale is basically profit. This is great in a rising market with lots of transactions. In a falling market, when sellers are in short supply, it is a disaster.\n\u201cWith Brexit uncertainty set to continue for even longer, the company has fallen back on bromides about how attractive the London property market is. Shareholders will ignore that and wait for people to start buying and selling again.\u201d\nThe shares were down 0.5% at 60.5p on Thursday.",

        "content": "The perfect angle can enhance the most perfect moments in football, so which are the best? Here are some suggestions\nFootball can be an exhausting business, a sport that carries as many reasons to hate as to love it. But then something like this comes along, a perfect shot from a perfect angle of a perfect pass, and the rest of it just melts away for a little while.\nWhat are the best camera angles of specific passes or goals? e.g. this beauty pic.twitter.com/D6jjRNpkT0\nThe perfect TV camera angle can certainly enhance a moment of brilliance, to give a moment we\u2019ve all seen a thousand times something extra. Take John McGinn\u2019s goal for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday earlier this season: it would have been pretty special if the only surviving record was via a bad courtroom artist, but this angle, perfectly capturing the power, technique and fade, makes it even more special. See also this shot of Benjamin Pavard\u2019s goal against Argentina, Cuco Martina\u2019s physics-defier against Arsenal and naturally there are plenty of that Roberto Carlos free-kick.\nWhat about this one of Georghe Hagi\u2019s strike from downtown for Romania against Colombia in the 1994 World Cup? The angle from behind of Michael Essien\u2019s thriker against Arsenal is especially enjoyable for one kid in the crowd flinching, convinced the ball was going to hit him, before it swerved round a corner and into the net. And on that theme, enjoy Ibrahima Sissoko\u2019s effort for Monaco from this season. Or indeed Phil Coutinho versus Switzerland at the World Cup.\nAnother night to forget for Thierry Henry. \ud83d\ude48Ibrahima Sissoko helped consign Monaco to defeat with a sublime curler. \ud83d\udd25Perfect camera angle too. \ud83d\ude0d pic.twitter.com/bcs3XiL7ae\nCameras seem to follow Tom Huddlestone\u2019s best moments around perfectly, but a favourite is watching this one zoot through Rafa van der Vaart\u2019s legs. Gio van Bronckhorst caught this one against Uruguay real nice, and so did the camera operator.\nThe low angle shot of Ronaldinho\u2019s debut strike for Barcelona captures the broiling excitement splendidly. This one of Aaron Ramsey scoring against Galatasaray is special not just because it catches the strike delightfully, but also Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s reaction to it. The reverse angle of Josimar in 1986 is always worth watching. Can a good angle enhance a penalty? You bet it can.\nAnd then, much like the angle that inspired this whole thing, there are the passes. This one picks out the brilliance of \u00c9ver Banega\u2019s ball to Leo Messi in Russia this past summer. And then Daley Blind\u2019s ping on to Robin van Persie\u2019s head four years earlier, not forgetting the long, lingering shot of Jos\u00e9 Luis Sierra setting up Marcelo Salas against England in 1998.\nThis Banega pass gets me every time pic.twitter.com/ovzz7ZusUt\nGot to be up there pic.twitter.com/Hy9AJDL6vk\nA favourite: pic.twitter.com/CLmmG4mVcR\nAnd finally, let\u2019s return to a goal, and the most perfect angle from one of the most perfect moments in World Cup history: gol di Grosso.\nWhich ones have we missed?

Other countries in the region prohibit same-sex acts, including Algeria, Morocco, Oman, Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait and some of the United Arab Emirates.\nSyria, which is suspended from the Arab League, was not represented at the summit.\nBettel\u2019s point is underscored by the treatment of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Egypt, the country that hosted the summit.\nHomosexuality is not illegal in Egypt, but LGBT people are frequently detained on euphemistic charges such as \u201cdebauchery\u201d. After the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, came to power in a coup in 2013, he \u201cappeared to embrace persecution of gays and trans people as a political strategy\u201d according to a report by Human Rights Watch.\nEU leaders said they raised human rights with their Arab counterparts. \u201cI insisted that our summit declaration should include our common commitment \u2026 to the upholding of all aspects of internal human rights law,\u201d Donald Tusk, the European council president, told journalists after the summit.\nThe EU had to acquiesce, however, to Arab demands to drop a reference to freedom of expression in the summit communique in favour of more general wording on upholding international human rights law.\nThe European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, defended the bloc\u2019s decision to hold the summit. \u201cIf I only talked to flawless democrats, then I would end my week already by Tuesday,\u201d he said.\nStanding alongside Tusk and Juncker at the final press conference, Sisi defended the death penalty and dismissed criticism of his human rights record. \u201cWe are two different cultures \u2026 Our priority is preserving our countries and stopping them from collapse, destruction and ruin, as you see in many surrounding states.\u201d\nThese remarks were followed by enthusiastic applause from Arab officials and journalists.\nTusk, a former journalist who was jailed for his political activities in communist Poland, said: \u201cI really appreciate how enthusiastic your media is. It\u2019s impossible in Europe to have such a reaction. Congratulations.\u201d\nEU sources said the remarks were clearly sarcastic.\nEU officials see the summit as a success, partly because of the guest list. Most EU presidents and prime ministers took part, while the most controversial Arab leaders stayed away, including the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, who is accused of war crimes, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman.",

But from Friday the media regulator Ofcom\u2018s voluntary code of practice will give customers the right to exit a contract penalty-free if the company cannot fix poor broadband speed within a month. The same right will also apply to those buying a landline phone, broadband and TV bundled deal.\nBT, EE, Plusnet, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media - which together serve about 95% of home broadband customers \u2013 have all signed up to the new code. In December, it emerged that a quarter of UK homes do not have fast enough broadband to cope with a typical family\u2019s internet needs, such as downloading films and watching series on Netflix.\nFrom Friday, broadband buyers will have to be told the likely peak-time minimum speed they should receive during the busiest periods, typically between 8pm and 10pm. There will also be a guaranteed minimum speed which will be based on what other similar houses on the same broadband service should reasonably expect.\nThe Ofcom consumer group director, Lindsey Fussell, said: \u201cWhen you sign a contract, you should be treated fairly and know exactly what you\u2019re getting.\n\u201cThese protections mean broadband shoppers can buy with confidence. Before they sign up, customers will be told their minimum internet speed. And if companies break that promise, they\u2019ll have to sort it out quickly, or let the customer walk away.\u201d\nShe said the new rules only apply to new contracts signed after Friday with either a new or existing provider. Virgin Media cable customers and anyone else on a full-fibre deal will be able to leave their contract if their speed falls below 50% of the promised speed.\nSarah Threadgould from consumer group Which?said unclear and confusing information about broadband speeds has been an issue for too long.\n\u201cWe will be keeping a close eye to make sure the voluntary code is working for consumers. If not, Ofcom will need to step in and take stronger action,\u201d she said.",

The kiss in the surf in From Here to Eternity. The hand on the window in Titanic. The end of The Notebook, where Noah and Allison die of old age holding hands, lost in the memory of each other.\nExcept that last one isn\u2019t what British Netflix viewers got to see this week. Instead they saw a version of The Notebook where, rather than the film ending with the discovery of two corpses, some birds simply flew over a lake instead.\nThe ensuing outrage was so huge that Netflix UK was forced to write a weirdly defensive tweet to deny editing the saddest 20 seconds out of the film. \u201cWe are getting to the bottom of it asap\u201d they wrote.\nThings you should know\u2026\u2013 we did not edit the notebook\u2013 an alternate version exists and was supplied to us\u2013 we are getting to the bottom of it asap\u2013 apparently some films have more than one ending?!\nAs of this morning, the mistake has been corrected, and I\u2019m in two minds about how to react. On one hand, we now all know that The Notebook\u2019s original ending isn\u2019t canon, which automatically makes it far less authoritative.\nHow are we to really believe that Noah and Allison really died? What if there\u2019s a third alternate ending in existence, where the people who discover their bodies leave the room, then Noah and Allison open their eyes, high-five each other and spend the rest of the afternoon playing Time Crisis in a succession of novelty hats? Or an ending where they jointly possess Police Academy star Michael Winslow and make him do helicopter noises at a bewildered vicar? Or an ending where they look straight into the camera right at the moment of death and simultaneously intone: \u201cNone of this actually happened\u201d? How can we believe anything we see any more?\nOn the other hand, what an interesting experiment this could be. We live a post-Bandersnatch world now, where Netflix viewers are already used to experiencing different outcomes to their friends, so why not maximise this?\nWhy not keep the alternative version of The Notebook, and show it to people who might appreciate it? Netflix already has the technology to do this. Remember the furore last year when it was accused of recalibrating menu images so black subscribers saw Love, Actually advertised as a Chiwetel Ejiofor film? Let\u2019s do the same with The Notebook. If you\u2019ve watched a lot of films with dead people in it, go ahead and watch the original version. But if your viewing history seems in any way prudish or squeamish, you can see the edited version instead.\nIn fact, this could work with any number of films. If you\u2019ve shown a preference for happy endings, let\u2019s give you the alternative ending to Terminator 2 where Sarah Connor ends up a happy old granny. If you\u2019ve demonstrated an aversion to heavy-handed Jesus allegories, you could be shown the version of I Am Legend that ends with Will Smith realising that he is essentially a monstrous serial killer and not the saviour of mankind. Or, if Netflix decides that you really wouldn\u2019t like to see any of the Rambo sequels, it could serve up the version of First Blood where Rambo kills himself at the end.\nThere, a perfect world where everybody gets to see different versions of the same film tailored to their personal preferences. This Notebook mistake might be the beginning of something huge. We might never have to watch anything that challenges us ever again. Hooray for the bubble!",

        "content": "Film will only be released after shots of Mercury kissing other men have been dropped from film, reports say\nThe Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody will have all overt LGBT scenes removed for its release in China, it has been reported.\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, at least a minute will be cut from the film in order to secure permission for it to be screened in Chinese cinemas, including scenes where Mercury (played by Rami Malek) kisses other male characters. Scenes of drug use will also be removed.\nChina\u2019s reluctance to allow LGBT-themed films to reach cinema audiences was underlined when a domestic TV streaming service, Mango TV, was reported to have censored Malek\u2019s acceptance speech for the best actor Oscar on 24 February, replacing the phrase \u201cgay man\u201d with \u201cspecial group\u201d in its subtitles.\nAlthough a major commercial success all over the globe, Bohemian Rhapsody is likely to secure only a small-scale release in China \u2013 unlike Oscar-winners Moonlight and Call Me By Your Name, which failed to be released there at all. However, the live-action film Beauty and the Beast, with its brief \u201cgay moment\u201d, was given a significant release in 2017, earning a reported $85m.\nBohemian Rhapsody has already attracted considerable criticism for perceived \u201cstraightwashing\u201d in its originally released form, with suggestions that it glossed over Mercury\u2019s real-life hedonist persona. However, LGBTI activist Gary Nunn argued in the Guardian that film was \u201cinspiring\u201d and a \u201cjob well done\u201d.",

        "content": "She made her name in a drama about sadomasochism \u2013 and broke the mould again as a porn director in The Deuce. But it\u2019s her hotly debated new film that might prove to be her most transgressive yet\nNearly two decades ago, Maggie Gyllenhaal came crawling on her hands and knees into James Spader\u2019s office, a memo clutched between her teeth \u2013 but it may as well have been a calling card. Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance as Lee, the gagged and manacled office assistant/S&M sex slave in the now-notorious Secretary, set the tone for a career that has rarely lacked for daring.\nIn the years since, she has racked up a number of complex, even contradictory, roles: the defiant, self-absorbed ex-con in the indie film Sherrybaby; the capable, conflicted businesswoman drawn into the grubby world of arms dealing in the BBC thriller The Honourable Woman; and Eileen, the sex worker turned pioneering pornography director in David Simon\u2019s dawn-of-porn series, The Deuce. She says she has long rejected cinema\u2019s \u201cfantasy version of the powerful woman\u201d in favour of an \u201cactual woman\u201d, with \u201csome aspects that are powerful, and some that are confused, broken and vulnerable. I want all of it!\u201d she says, grinning from the vaguely Scandi-style sofa in her hotel suite.\nShe is in town to promote what may just be her messiest portrayal of an actual woman yet. In The Kindergarten Teacher, Gyllenhaal stars as Lisa, an outwardly sunny New York teacher with two children. But look a little more closely and things are darker. Her marriage, though loving, is entirely without spark, and her children seem distant, walled off behind smartphone screens. Lisa dreams of creating art of some kind, but at her weekly poetry class her work is dismissed as blandly derivative.\nThen one day after class, Lisa witnesses one of her pupils, five-year-old Jimmy, reciting a beautiful, opaque poem in a trance-like state. After learning that the poem is Jimmy\u2019s own work, and realising that his family has little interest in nurturing his talent, Lisa appoints herself patron to this prodigy. She reads out his work at her poetry group, takes him to museum visits (without his family\u2019s permission) to stir his creativity, and \u2013 here\u2019s the first real red flag \u2013 gives him her phone number so that he can call her when he conjures up a masterpiece. Then she goes further still, and the film lurches into truly uncomfortable territory. Without giving anything away, \u201cshe does some incredibly problematic things\u201d, Gyllenhaal says.\nAdapted from an Israeli film of the same name, The Kindergarten Teacher is a psychological thriller disguised as a small-stakes indie drama, the tension ratcheting up horribly with each morally murky decision Lisa makes. During its festival run, Gyllenhaal would pop into screenings to hear the agonised reactions of audience members. \u201cPeople would gasp, laugh, moan and make these noises,\u201d she says gleefully. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so beautiful about the way it\u2019s constructed. You\u2019ll go: \u2018Wait, maybe I am still with her.\u2019 Then: \u2018No, no, I couldn\u2019t possibly be.\u2019 It\u2019s so different for everybody, the point where they decide: \u2018No, I absolutely can\u2019t handle it any more.\u2019\u201d\nThat there is even a sliver of doubt in the audiences\u2019 minds over whether to root for Lisa is testament to Gyllenhaal\u2019s ability to bring her to life. This, after all, is the actor who managed to make a sadomasochistic submissive seem not just relatable to those of a more vanilla persuasion, but even ever-so-slightly wholesome. Her characters are suffused with a messy humanity that makes their every choice \u2013 as desperate, foolish or horrible as they may be \u2013 if not sympathetic, then at least in keeping with the cracked, flawed environment around them.\nIn the case of Lisa, it\u2019s an environment where women are positioned as the facilitators of male creativity rather than being allowed to be creative themselves. \u201cShe is a woman who is starving, a woman with a vibrant, curious, artistic mind which has not been fed,\u201d she says. \u201cI think many women right now in America \u2013 and I imagine it\u2019s the same in the UK \u2013 are waking up to that feeling. And, in some ways, I think it\u2019s a cautionary tale. There are consequences for starving a woman\u2019s mind, and the consequences here are \u2026 extreme.\u201d\nGyllenhaal, it seems, gives a great deal of thought to what drives the people she is playing. Then again, she seems to give a great deal of thought to just about everything. Her answers tend to be long and digressive, peppered with \u201chmm\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d. Unlike Lisa, it is safe to assume, she\u2019s not artistically starved. At 41, she has reached that point of her career where \u2013 as in the case with The Kindergarten Teacher and The Deuce \u2013 she is producing projects as well as starring in them, and has optioned an Elena Ferrante novel that she plans to direct.\nShe has agency and autonomy now, although that hasn\u2019t always been the case. There was the time early on in her career when, while auditioning for a \u201creally bad movie with vampires\u201d, she was told that she wasn\u2019t \u201chot enough\u201d and was encouraged by her manager to \u201csex it up a bit\u201d for the second audition. (She wore leather trousers and a leopard print top, and still didn\u2019t get the part.)\nEven after Secretary, she was being told by people in the industry that, while they were desperate to cast her, she didn\u2019t \u201cmean enough money-wise\u201d, a statement that you can\u2019t really imagine being directed at a male actor who had just been the recipient of gushing reviews and a Golden Globe nomination. (No one balked at, say, Gyllenhaal\u2019s brother, Jake, starring in a blockbuster such as The Day After Tomorrow off the back of Donnie Darko and a couple of other indies.) More recently still, she was told that, at 37, she was too old to play the romantic interest for a male character who was 55.\nSo you can understand when she says that, despite their obvious differences, Lisa stirred up in her \u201ca personal feeling of the ways in which I\u2019ve twisted myself \u2013 bent myself backwards \u2013 in order to do things that I thought I had to do in order to survive in this culture. And the ways in which that hurts, and the cost \u2026 the toll that takes on you.\u201d\nStill, for all her empathy for the character, \u201cit was not a pleasure to play Lisa because it\u2019s hard to have to twist my mind around her very flawed logic\u201d. In fact, so dark is the path that Lisa heads down that, at one point, Gyllenhaal doubted the film could be made. She was concerned that Parker Sevak, the child actor playing Jimmy, would struggle with the subject matter. \u201cI thought: \u2018Actually, I don\u2019t know how we can do it and not for one minute make a five-year-old child feel that their boundaries have been crossed.\u2019\u201d\nGyllenhaal only changed her mind after considering that she, the film\u2019s director Sara Colangelo and three of the film\u2019s other producers were all mothers to young children and so were probably better placed than most to guide him through the process. (Gyllenhaal, who is married to the actor Peter Sarsgaard, has two daughters, aged 12 and six).\n\u201cBasically, I\u2019ve worked a lot with kids, and I don\u2019t think five-year-olds are actors,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t say to a five-year-old: \u2018I need you to go deeper into this emotional space.\u2019 No! But you can say: \u2018When I clap my hands, you\u2019re going to turn your head quickly, and you\u2019re going to say: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\u2019 Or we would just have the camera across the room on a long lens, and he wouldn\u2019t know it. Catching his childishness.\n\u201cWe were trying to protect him from feeling uncomfortable. It\u2019s interesting because his character, like any five-year-old, feels that the boundaries are in the wrong place. Children think: \u2018Oh, wait \u2013 why am I being taken out of nap time?\u2019 His character feels pretty much immediately that something is off, even if he doesn\u2019t know how to say it.\u201d\nThere is another complicating factor to the already fraught relationship between Lisa and Jimmy: the fact he is the child of Indian immigrants, and she is a white woman. Among otherwise positive reviews, this aspect of the relationship has prompted a few stirrings of disapproval. In an article for The Week, headlined \u201cThe Kindergarten Teacher has a race problem\u201d, the critic Candice Frederick lamented the fact that the exploitation of a child of colour \u201cgoes entirely unmentioned\u201d and that the film highlights \u201c[white] female complexity at the detriment of nonwhite characters\u201d.\nGyllenhaal hasn\u2019t seen the article, but argues that the racial dynamic between the characters is an implicit part of the film\u2019s messy stew of ideas. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s the child of Indian immigrants is a piece of the storytelling, and she has erased not only his race but his authorship,\u201d she says. \u201cI think in some ways that is the story that we\u2019re telling. It\u2019s a part of the intention of the film, as opposed to an unconscious mistake. I think that it\u2019s a very problematic trip that we watch her go on \u2013 and race is a part of that trip.\u201d\nStill, it is clearly food for thought, and, after we have moved on to another topic, she abruptly shifts back to the subject at the forefront of her mind. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2026 I\u2019m still thinking about your last question,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about putting something difficult on the table and looking at the ways that people respond to it. I wonder what it would mean to have [Jimmy\u2019s race] be more explicit \u2013 to be more of a part of the actual storytelling.\u201d\nYou suspect she\u2019ll be mulling it over for some time because that\u2019s what she tends to do. Recently, she has had to do a lot of thinking about The Deuce, or more specifically James Franco\u2019s role in it. During the hiatus between the drama\u2019s first and second seasons, Franco \u2013 who plays twin brothers \u2013 was accused by a number of women of sexual misconduct at his New York acting school. (Franco denies the allegations.) There were calls for him to be removed from the show, particularly given that its subject matter concerns the abuse and exploitation of women. Yet, when the second season aired last autumn, Franco still had a starring role.\nGyllenhaal, who has been a prominent figure in the #TimesUp movement against sexual harassment and abuse, says that her thinking on Franco\u2019s role in the Deuce \u201cchanges all the time\u201d. She says that show\u2019s producers checked with the female members of the cast and crew to make sure that they were comfortable working with him, and no concerns were raised. She believes that \u201cthere have to be consequences for disrespecting women sexually, or at all\u201d, but feels that cancelling the series \u2013 as some speculated the show\u2019s network HBO would do \u2013 would have sent the wrong message.\n\u201cThe show is about misogyny and inequality in the entertainment business,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I feel that there are all of these fascinating women telling these stories that illuminate exactly what is on the table in terms of feminism at the moment. That would have felt misguided and confused to me.\u201d\nBecause, even in 2019, it is still an uphill task getting these stories made by and about women on to our screens. Gyllenhaal points to the production for The Kindergarten Teacher, a gruelling five-week shoot on a shoestring that at one point saw her \u201cchanging my clothes between scenes in the bathroom on the Staten Island ferry\u201d.\n\u201cOn one level I feel like: OK we were this group of women, of course we never expected to have enough money to make the movie,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we just were, like: \u2018On with it! Let\u2019s make it work.\u2019 And I feel very proud of that. And on another level, I think: \u2018Why don\u2019t we have enough money? We just needed a little more!\u2019 And I do think that has something to do with a kind of inequality that we\u2019ve just gotten used to.\u201d\nAfter all, she adds: \u201cNobody should ever be naked in the bathroom on the Staten Island ferry if you can help it.\u201d\nThe Kindergarten Teacher is released on 8 March",

But disappointingly, instead of getting comedy mileage out of devil worshippers with bad eyeliner in Newcastle, or off-roading into horror movie territory, Burning Men takes the route of self-serious drama. Groaningly, it kneels down before the fantasy of the brooding male creative genius.\nEdward Hayter is Ray, the frontman of Burning Men, a London three-piece too wasted \u2013 or perhaps too talentless \u2013 to get beyond covering Clash hits. Depressed after catching his girlfriend shagging the band\u2019s drummer and being evicted from his flat, Ray decides to sell his vinyl collection to pay his way to Memphis with bassist Don (Aki Omoshaybi) \u2013 buzzy handheld camerawork signposting their crazy, freewheeling lifestyles. After pinching the death metal record at a vinyl fair, the pair take off in their conspicuously beat-up car with a party bag of drugs, first to Norfolk then to Newcastle, proving once again that there\u2019s rarely anything so dreary as watching people getting high on film.\nYou desperately want Burning Men to take the piss out of charmless Roy and Don as the crap rockers they seem to be. But the solemn script is fully signed up to notion that they have rich inner lives \u2013 despite all the available evidence. Ray\u2019s fathomless depth is suggested by his ability to recite lines from William Blake while staring at landscape. And this is a movie with attitudes to women so unwoke that scenes with a pair of gagging-for-it groupies could have been lifted from a Mick Jagger biography.",

        "content": "President says he believes North Korean leader knew nothing about treatment of US student\nDonald Trump has said he took Kim Jong-un at his word when he denied any responsibility for the imprisonment and torture of Otto Warmbier that led to the US student\u2019s death in 2017.\n\u201cSome really bad things happened to Otto,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut Kim tells me that he didn\u2019t know about it and I will take him at his word.\u201d\nKim wields tremendous power in one of the world\u2019s last totalitarian regimes, but Trump said he believed the North Korean leader was unaware of Warmbier\u2019s imprisonment in January 2016 and subsequent torture until it was too late.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he knew about it. He felt very badly about it, I did speak to him. He knew about it, but he knew about it after,\u201d Trump said. North Korea was a big country with a lot of people \u201cin those prisons and those camps\u201d, he said.\u201cAnd some really bad things happened to Otto. Some really, really bad things.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s remarks exculpating the North Korean dictator are likely to draw sharp criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress, where there is persistent outrage over Warmbier\u2019s treatment.\nThe 22-year-old University of Virginia student, who visited North Korea on a study trip, was arrested as he was returning to the US for allegedly trying to take home a propaganda poster.\nHe was sentenced to 15 years hard labour but was returned in a state of \u201cunresponsive wakefulness\u2019 in June 2017, after suffering torture in prison. He died six days after arriving back in the US. A coroner said the cause of his brain damage was unclear.\nAny criticism of Trump\u2019s comments is likely to be heightened by the fact that he invited Warmbier\u2019s family to his State of the Union address in January, and looked up at them in the first lady\u2019s box during his speech.\n\u201cYou are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all,\u201d Trump said, drawing a standing ovation from Congress. \u201cTonight, we pledge to honour Otto\u2019s memory with total American resolve.\n\u201cAfter a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labour, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death.\u201d\nIn Hanoi on Thursday, however, he struck a markedly different tone, saying he did not think Kim \u201cwould have allowed that to happen\u201d and arguing it was not to his advantage. He suggested instead that the death was because of generally bad jail conditions. \u201cThose prisons are rough. They\u2019re rough places, and bad things happen,\u201d he said.\nIt could be argued that Trump\u2019s protectiveness of Kim is part of a pattern of giving dictators the benefit of the doubt on abuses. Otherwise loyal congressional Republicans have broken with him over his willingness to believe figures such as Mohammed bin Salman and Vladimir Putin rather than his own advisers and intelligence services.\n This article was amended on 2 March 2019 to correct remarks attributed to Donald Trump about North Korea\u2019s prison camps. An earlier version quoted Trump as saying: \u201cThere are some bad people\u201d. This has been corrected to: \u201cAnd some really bad things happened to Otto. Some really, really bad things.\u201d",

        "content": "The Australian songwriter felt burnt out and condescended to following the success of her debut album. Her latest, Crushing, is a bold reclamation\nGrowing up in the Blue Mountains just outside Sydney, Julia Jacklin was as drawn to Top 40 pop artists of the early 2000s \u2013 think Britney and Avril \u2013 as she was to the Billy Bragg and Doris Day records in her parents\u2019 record collection. Life in suburbia informed her 2016 debut, Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. She confessed, on this collection of coming-of-age songs that blended folk and country traditions and was held together by her measured yet otherworldly voice, to her fear of failing at this new, hopeful life as a musician.\nFailure never came to pass \u2013 the album drew comparisons with the likes of Angel Olsen and Sharon Van Etten and found success in the UK, a country long receptive to the charms of Australia\u2019s finest shaggy songwriters. As she found her footing, Jacklin learned that success meant leaving behind everything that felt familiar. She is a relatively new transplant to Melbourne, where we meet. Eight months ago, she packed up her life in Sydney after realising, following years on the road, that her \u201csense of home was not in a city any more, it was in people\u201d.\n\u201cLyrically, it\u2019s quite a bit more basic than I used to write,\u201d she says of her excellent new album, Crushing. \u201cI always thought my second record would be really produced, like, \u2018Watch out world, here I am!\u2019 That\u2019s how it always feels: that you\u2019ve got to be a bigger, better version of yourself. But I was too tired to try to be anything more than I was.\u201d\nWho she was changed suddenly and without warning. As an intense touring cycle wrapped up, her long-term relationship ended and she returned home to Sydney to find a city that \u201cdidn\u2019t really look the same\u201d. Her gut reaction was to retreat into her new normal: more touring, a transient life she\u2019d come to rely on and resent in equal measure. \u201cWith touring, I felt like I was just this thing that was getting from A to B,\u201d Jacklin says, the powerlessness of that reality manifesting in a resigned shrug. \u201cI felt totally disconnected from my own thoughts and my own wants and needs.\u201d\nJacklin has spoken before of the early self-doubt that threatened to derail her potential, and how the process of performing her work on tour, to increasing crowds, reinforced the facts that she was deserving and legitimate. During the two years she spent on the road \u2013 \u201ca really wonderful, turbo time of growth\u201d \u2013 she also discovered that success in the music world was reliant on accepting its hazy parameters. \u201cThe social and business lines are just so murky,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich I don\u2019t love.\u201d\nBeing treated as an artist made her feel infantilised, and suspicious that industry associates who were \u201ctoo nice\u201d were withholding essential information in a misguided attempt to protect Jacklin from reality. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to just be this fun, social person who\u2019s happy to go out to a million industry drinks. Sometimes I just want to know what the numbers and figures and facts are, so I can just do my job. It feels like people treat you like a toddler and they hide all the business stuff. I\u2019m an adult who\u2019s doing this for a living. This is my life. This is my livelihood. I want to know the ins and outs.\u201d\nJacklin says she has shared this experience with other female artists, who understand how \u201cconstantly working with men\u201d can often mean that advocating for her own needs leads to being interpreted as demanding or distant. \u201cAt the beginning it feels like, if you aren\u2019t really fun and entertaining, that they won\u2019t sign you, and you might be ruining your chances,\u201d she says. She found herself confronting the hurdle of being likable on the road as well, where she held back from asking for the space she needed \u2013 mentally, physically and emotionally \u2013 \u201cbecause it just felt like that was too needy or whatever\u201d.\nTo survive playing songs about her emotions every night, she also had to hold those emotions at arm\u2019s-length, which led to a period of deep disassociation. \u201cIt was a really intense time: incredible highs that you just can\u2019t even believe, like playing your songs to thousands of people who have bought tickets to see you. But then also not seeing family and friends for months and months at a time, and trying to maintain the most composed, happy version of yourself in order to keep the whole thing going.\u201d\nThis disconnect made its way on to Crushing in the form of a recurring lyrical motif about her body. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time / I raised my body up to be mine,\u201d she sings \u2013 joyfully \u2013 on Head Alone. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a relationship and also really busy, I just kind of give up the sense that this is my body and my life,\u201d she explains.\nAfter one tour, in an effort to escape completely, she sought out a jarringly solitary environment. \u201cI went to Slovenia for three weeks and stayed in a very isolated mountain region by myself. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone. It was really beautiful, but there\u2019s no balance there. I\u2019d feel the pressure cooker [of touring] and I\u2019d have to disappear just to be able to come back and do it again. Trying to find balance in that world without feeling like you have to literally run into the wilderness is really difficult.\u201d\nAs she sits across from me describing the period in her life that inspired Crushing, it\u2019s all very clearly in the past tense. She is confident and clear-eyed as she talks about entering this new phase of her career with \u201ca much stronger sense of self\u201d. Uniting the loose ends that were, for a long time, her body and mind \u2013 and connecting her ambitions to her newfound acceptance that she may not be thought of kindly for articulating what she wants \u2013 was obstacle-ridden but ultimately empowering. The result is a body of work that looks you in the eye, says what it means, and reflects every part of her.\n Julia Jacklin is touring Australia through March, including at Womadelaide and Spiegeltent Hobart, before dates in the UK, Europe and the US",

        "content": "Crewe accused of \u2018desperate and dirty\u2019 attempt to fight claims Steve Walters tells lawyers to issue high court proceedings\nCrewe Alexandra have been accused of a \u201cdesperate and dirty tactic\u201d after new revelations about how far they are willing to go to fight claims they should be liable for Barry Bennell\u2019s crimes against boys from the club\u2019s junior set-up.\nIn the latest development in the Bennell scandal, Crewe\u2019s lawyers have written to one of the victims to say there is \u201cno reasonable explanation or justification\u201d for him having waited until his mid-40s before reporting his former youth-team coach.\nThe player in question is Steve Walters, who was sexually abused by Bennell during the mid-1980s and came forward in November 2016 on the back of Andy Woodward\u2019s interview in the Guardian to highlight his own ordeal as another of the club\u2019s former youth-team players. Walters, who became the youngest first-team player in Crewe\u2019s history when he made his debut in 1988 at the age of 16, is one of the 12 victims whose complaints against Bennell led to the former Manchester City coach and scout being sentenced to 30 years in prison last year.\nNow 47, Walters is one of the former players who is pursuing legal action against Crewe but says he has been notified the club is fighting his claims on the basis he did not report them earlier. Crewe, according to the lawyers representing Walters, are trying to get the case thrown out on a technicality, namely that he missed a three-year time limit for reporting what happened to him from the age of 13 to 14, and that too much time has elapsed for the allegations to be proved \u2013 even though a jury convicted Bennell of 50 specimen charges during a trial at Liverpool crown court last year.\n\u201cThis response is a slap in the face,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAll I have ever wanted was for Crewe to take responsibility for what they have done \u2013 the role they played in the abuse of so many children. They are blaming me for not coming forward soon enough. They say how much they regret the abuse that took place, yet in the same breath deny any responsibility for what happened to me. After everything we have been through in the criminal trial, all the evidence that emerged, I am absolutely disgusted.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s information is that Crewe are fighting an unspecified number of other claims from Bennell\u2019s victims and Walters now says he has asked his legal team to issue high court proceedings against the club where the man described as a \u201cchild molester on an industrial scale\u201d preyed on him and countless others.\nCrewe said in a statement: \u201cThis matter is being handled by the club\u2019s insurer\u2019s solicitors and remains the subject of ongoing legal proceedings. It is not therefore appropriate for the club to comment at this stage.\u201d\nWalters added: \u201cWe have been dignified and wanted to be amicable but Crewe is showing no humanity. How would the club\u2019s chairman [John Bowler] like it if one of his loved ones was told they had waited too long to report abuse?\n\u201cIt\u2019s only recently I\u2019ve been able to speak about what happened. There was a culture of secrecy and shame back then and that\u2019s what Bennell used to enable him to abuse so many boys. I never expected to have that delay thrown back in my face; I\u2019m horrified by Crewe\u2019s tactics. This is not the behaviour of an organisation which says it wants to take responsibility and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nBennell, described by a judge as \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d, is serving his fourth prison sentence from the past 25 years and is facing the possibility of another criminal trial. As of January last year, at least 97 people had reported Bennell since Woodward\u2019s decision to waive his anonymity.\nKim Harrison, an abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represents Walters, said: \u201cPredatory paedophiles like Bennell operate by scaring and shaming their victims into silence. This fear and shame makes it incredibly difficult for victims to disclose abuse. It can take years and sometimes even decades for victims of child sexual abuse to find the courage to speak out.\n\u201cTo use that against him [Walters] is a desperate and dirty tactic, but if Crewe think it will wear Steve down and make him give up they couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\u201cThis is only going to make us more determined to get justice and hold them to account. We have tried to engage with them and reach an amicable solution, so Steve can try to move on with his life, but Crewe Alexandra have put two fingers up to him. We have been left with no alternative but to issue legal proceedings against them in the high court.\u201d",

I\u2019m totally proud that a little lowly backbench MP like me has been able to unite the House of Commons on this contentious Brexit issue over one of the least contentious subjects and bring the government to the dispatch box and vote in favour.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ll be writing to Donald Tusk seeking a meeting with a cross-party delegation from parliament to ask him to engage in a positive manner with the European council and ask him to give serious consideration to a unanimous mandate for the European commission to carve out part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens\u2019 rights and have it as a special treaty in international law.\u201d\nCampaign groups British in Europe and the3million in the UK who had met Costa just a few weeks ago to press their case said they were delighted with the amendment.\nTonight we did it. Through the solidarity of BritishinEurope and @the3million working together, we persuaded the UK Parliament to make the UK govt push for our rights to be ring fenced whatever the outcome of Brexit pic.twitter.com/cfzKpXIDmk\nIn an extraordinary development on Wednesday Costa was forced to quit his job for speaking out but hours later won cross-party support for the amendment.\nMany now believe he should be reinstated as parliamentary private secretary to the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, but Costa says he doesn\u2019t \u201cgive a stuff about being a junior aide\u201d and if he had to resign over the rights of 5 million people \u201cso be it\u201d.\nCommons approves @AlbertoCostaMP's Amendment (b) to the #BrexitNextSteps motion without a divisionThis requires the PM to seek a joint UK-EU commitment to adopt part 2 of the Withdrawal Agreement on citizens' rights whatever the outcome of negotiations on other parts of the deal pic.twitter.com/PzRd7yhHfS\nCosta\u2019s move seemed to hit quicksand after he tabled the amendment, with Theresa May indicating government disapproval. She told the house the EU had said ringfencing rights across the bloc was unworkable as they did not have \u201clegal authority\u201d to do so.\nAfter consulting Prof Stijn Smismans, professor of EU law at Cardiff University, Costa confirmed that the commission did not have the authority but that was to miss the point.\nSmismans, pointed out that the European council \u201ccan revise that mandate at any time. There is no legal hurdle at all\u201d.\nAs part of the plan Costa also wants the no-deal citizens\u2019 treaty to have a transition period, as originally envisaged up to the end of 2021 at least.\nThis would enable the resumption of negotiation on citizens\u2019 rights that were omitted from the withdrawal agreement because they were due to be part of the second phase of Brexit negotiations on freedom of movement issues and the future relationship between the EU and the UK.\nThis would be a boon for the estimated 1 million British nationals in Europe who, as it currently stands, will not be allow to work or offer a service in a second member state. It prevents, for example, British nationals who live in Germany or Belgium, entering Luxembourg to work, and prevents British nationals in Spain or Italy offering services ranging from accountancy to law to translation to do so from their home state.",

        "content": "Poland the worst offender as global justice index identifies decline in checks on government power for second successive year\nAutocratic rule is on the rise throughout the world, with a growing number of authoritarian leaders \u201chijacking\u201d laws to consolidate their own power, a study of global justice has found.\nPoland demonstrated the most significant turn towards authoritarianism over the past four years, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In all, 64% of 126 countries surveyed made similar moves towards autocratic rule in the past year alone, according to an annual rule of law index published by the World Justice Project.\nWith more countries declining than improving in their overall performance on the rule of law, the global trend towards authoritarianism should be viewed with concern, said WJP\u2019s executive director, Elizabeth Andersen.\n\u201cThis slide in rule of law in general and checks on government powers in particular is deeply concerning,\u201d said Andersen.\n\u201cThere is a crucial difference between \u2018rule by law\u2019 and \u2018rule of law\u2019. In too many countries, laws and legal institutions are being manipulated to undermine rather than uphold the rule of law, even as governments wrap their actions in \u2018rule of law\u2019 rhetoric.\u201d\nThe study\u2019s authors noted that \u201cconstraints on government powers\u201d \u2013 the extent to which a nation is checked by factor including the existence and strength of independent judiciaries, a free press, and the ability of legislatures to apply oversight\u2013 also declined significantly in China, Egypt, Honduras, Hungary, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Senegal and Turkey.\nThe second largest decline over the past year was in criminal justice, followed by open government and fundamental rights. The biggest four-year decline was in fundamental rights, with 70% of countries sliding in areas including due process of law and the right to life, freedom of expression and religion.\nThe index is seen as the world\u2019s most comprehensive dataset of its kind. Based on primary data from 120,000 households and 3,800 expert surveys in 126 countries, it measures a nation\u2019s rule of law performance in relation to eight factors: constraints on government powers; absence of corruption; open government; fundamental rights; order and security; regulatory enforcement; civil justice; and criminal justice.\nEighteen countries have experienced consistent year-to-year declines, according to the report, while 14 have steadily improved each year. The largest overall improvement globally was in regulatory enforcement, where there was a 70% increase in government adherence over the past year.\nScandinavia topped the index, with Denmark finishing in first place, followed by Norway and Finland. The UK was ranked 12th, while the US rated 20th. At the bottom of the list were the the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cambodia and Venezuela.\nThe most notable improvements were seen in Argentina and Estonia, said WJP\u2019s chief research officer, Alejandro Ponce.\n\u201cSince 2015, no country has improved their overall rule of law score as much as Argentina. Unlike the majority of countries in our study over the past few years, Argentina saw a remarkable improvement in checks and balances on government power,\u201d said Ponce.\nEstonia has dramatically increased its scores in terms of open government, as well as constraints on government powers and civil justice, said Ponce.\nWhile a change of government can put a stop to authoritarianism, changing problematic state institutions is a far more complicated process, said Andersen, partly because of \u201copposition from stakeholders who benefit from entrenched economic policies\u201d.\nWhile each country will need to find its own response to authoritarianism, the global community needs \u201cto begin to call a spade a spade when it comes to rule of law\u201d, said Andersen.\n\u201cIronically, one of the most striking things about the degradation of the rule of law is that it is being effected through laws and legal institutions. The law itself is being hijacked and used to erode checks on power. Even as they amass new powers, authoritarian leaders cynically justify their actions as upholding the rule of law. Hopefully the index will help highlight what\u2019s really happening to the rule of law around the world.\u201d",

Subtracting his first appearance, when he opened for Tina Turner in 1985, still leaves 28 headlining shows at England\u2019s most iconic hangar \u2013 testament to what can be achieved by a reliable, raw-throated artisan who does things with little fuss. So little fuss, in fact, that he can walk through a crowded shopping mall \u2013 a clip of this is shown during an amiable run-through of Can\u2019t Stop This Thing We Started \u2013 and be recognised by only a dozen people. But if the 59-year-old Canadian is ostensibly an average Joe who can\u2019t stop this unglamorous thing he started, he has also produced enough stone-cold hooks to deflect the argument that he\u2019s just a garage rocker who got very lucky.\nTake, say, (Everything I Do) I Do It for You, chucked in without ceremony halfway through the 28-song set: it might have been a source of white-hot irritation in 1991 as it clocked up 16 lumbering weeks at No 1, but stately rock ballads are a rarity in 2019, and tonight, freed of its bad old associations, it\u2019s nothing less than majestic. The full house of veteran fans sings the first verse of Summer of \u201969 as Adams stands and listens, perhaps marvelling at the way the undeniable melody line is elevated to a near-Springsteenian moment of communality. Then there\u2019s a powerful blast through the minor-chord adultery rocker Run to You, accompanied by a monochrome video of stockinged female legs hurrying down a city street (there are quite a few Helmut Newtonesque clips tonight, which is only odd if you don\u2019t know that Adams has a second career as a rather arty photographer). I\u2019m a bit breathless after that one.\nEnough such moments punctuate the show \u2013 even his new album\u2019s title track, the Ed Sheeran co-write Shine a Light, is grabby despite its unfamiliarity \u2013 to suggest that, on stage, Adams is more than the sum of his parts. Despite his sharp black suit and slicked-back hair, he\u2019s good old Bryan from the block \u2013 until he pits his raspy sincerity against a massive hook and produces classic-rock gold.\n At FlyDSA Arena, Sheffield, on Friday.

        "content": "With fewer than 100 days until the World Cup kicks off in Paris, preparations are in their final stages. This is a big week in women\u2019s football, with international teams involved in the Algarve Cup, the Cyprus Cup and the SheBelieves Cup in the United States, where England are competing. These tournaments are key for building momentum and confidence, and for helping the coaches decide which 23 players will go to the World Cup.\nPhil Neville said before flying to the US that \u201cthe door is not shut on any player with ambitions of making the squad\u201d but it\u2019s certainly closing fast. By now I expect he will have a good idea of what his first-choice team will be, and most of the back-up players he is planning to take. Some of them, such as Seattle\u2019s Jodie Taylor and Chelsea\u2019s Fran Kirby, have not been playing regularly for their clubs, so it will be important to build their confidence on the international stage.\nEngland got a fantastic result in their first game against Brazil, winning 2-1 after going 1-0 down from a dubious penalty. The first-half performance was nervy and sloppy with lots of possession lost in defensive and midfield areas, but in the second half there was more urgency, and the midfield and forwards won the ball back higher up the pitch, leading to crossing opportunities which the Brazil goalkeeper struggled to deal with. This type of positive reaction will be needed in abundance during difficult matches at the World Cup. A second victory over Brazil in five months will also give England a massive morale boost, and the knowledge they can beat the other top teams, even when not at their best.\nEngland go into this World Cup with the pressure of expectation to win the tournament, which we didn\u2019t have in 2015 in Canada. They will be among the favourites but, like in the men\u2019s competition last year, there are a lot of teams who will travel with genuine title hopes. Gone are the days when you thought only Germany or USA could win it.\nThere are half a dozen teams I think could lift the trophy, with USA, France, Japan, Australia, England and the Netherlands in with a good chance. Germany and Canada were among the six top seeds and could come through the pack but I wouldn\u2019t put them among my favourites. Germany have changed manager since the 2017 European Championship but they limped through that tournament and I\u2019m not convinced they have the cutting edge. John Herdman left Canada\u2019s women\u2019s team last year to become manager of their men\u2019s side, and without his huge influence they remain in transition.\nI\u2019m particularly intrigued to see how France get on. They have so much talent but though they won the SheBelieves Cup last year they never seem to get over the line in major tournaments. Psychologically they can be fragile, so it will be really interesting to see if home support strengthens them, or if they struggle with the additional pressure of being the host nation.\nAustralia are ranked No 6 in the world but I think they\u2019ve got a great chance. They have had to overcome some upheaval this year but they have a great squad, excellent fitness levels, are strong in defence and they have arguably the best striker in the world in Sam Kerr. I play with a lot of the Italian national team players at Juventus, and I\u2019d love to see them do well, but with Australia and Brazil in their group it isn\u2019t going to be easy for them.\nOnce this week\u2019s international competitions are over the players will go back to their clubs and focus on the conclusion to the league campaigns. The end of the season is in sight but it\u2019s still far enough away that you can put the World Cup to the back of your mind. Once you get to the final weeks of the season, into April and May, that\u2019s when the excitement really kicks in.\nThere does come a time, in the final weeks before a big tournament, when you become conscious as a player of the need to avoid injury. As a forward it is always a bit easier to avoid the kind of challenges that can cause impact injuries. If you\u2019re running through on goal, there are two months until the World Cup, it\u2019s a 50\u201150 ball and some crazy keeper\u2019s coming out and is about to take your leg off, I think a forward who\u2019s wise enough will protect themselves. We can be tackled but referees are there to police dangerous challenges. Forwards are protected by the laws of the game and the way it\u2019s played, while defenders and midfielders have to throw themselves about a bit more.\nMy own preparations for the World Cup are also in full swing. I\u2019ve been out of the England team for three years, so I\u2019m well adjusted to not being part of the squad, but I will be involved in a different way. My focus now is on another passion of mine: the media work.\nHaving played in three World Cups I\u2019ve had fabulous experiences and opportunities, and another has opened for me over the past three years \u2013 working at major international tournaments and being right in the heart of the action as a pundit. I will be preparing as seriously as if I was in the England team, watching the opposition, trying to identify strengths and weaknesses, the tactics and personalities. It will be my job to know all the stuff that people at home might not know. This week I will be watching everything I can, as the squads gather around the world. It will soon be summer, and the time is going to fly.\n Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

He wrote me beautiful letters.\u201d\nThose hand-delivered missives appear to have flattered Trump without offering concrete proposals of what Kim was going to do as part of a bargain. A joint statement issued in Singapore stated North Korea\u2019s commitment to the \u201ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d, which Trump appears to have understood as a pledge of complete unilateral nuclear disarmament.\nIn North Korea, however, the phrase is a routine regime slogan that refers to a gradual defusing of tensions on the peninsula and phased multilateral disarmament, during which North Korea would be treated as a nuclear power.\nFor his part, Kim appears to have come away from Singapore interpreting Trump\u2019s gushing behaviour as sign of a desperation to strike a deal, which would potentially leave most of his arsenal in place while normalising relations with the US and lifting sanctions.\nThese wildly different perceptions collided painfully in Hanoi, where the two leaders discovered each other not to be the ideal partner they had previously imagined.\n\u201cIt was obvious from the beginning that they would get stuck on the questions of how much denuclearisation there should be and how much sanctions relief,\u201d said Joseph Yun, former US special representative for North Korea policy now at the US Institute of Peace thinktank. \u201cBoth Kim and Trump are now in a very difficult position. I think Trump now has to realise that complete denuclearisation, however charming Kim may be, is not on the cards.\u201d\nYun said that Trump\u2019s room for manoeuvre was constrained by the timing of the summit, coinciding with a furious denunciation by his former lawyer in congressional hearings. The president\u2019s embattled position in Washington meant he had to deliver something spectacular in Hanoi or nothing at all.\n\u201cProbably a smaller deal was possible,\u201d Yun said. \u201cBut in my view Trump had to have a big deal, with Cohen going on in Washington. If he brought home a small deal he knew he would be heavily criticised.\u201d\nMany experts who have been severely critical of Trump\u2019s diplomacy said they thought he had done the right thing by refusing to accept the deal apparently presented in Hanoi by Kim: sanctions relief in return for undertakings to shut down North Korea\u2019s oldest and biggest nuclear weapons complex at Yongbyon.\nThe two sides dispute the extent of sanctions relief: the US has said Kim wanted complete relief, North Korea has said it was asking for partial relief.\n\u201cYou can all argue whether this should have been done at a summit at all,\u201d said Joel Wit, a former state department official with long experience of negotiating with North Korea and now a senior fellow at the Stimson Center thinktank. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that deal either. I think it was the right thing to do not to sign.\u201d\nVipin Narang, an expert on nuclear proliferation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was \u201cbetter that Kim Jong-un didn\u2019t commit to shutting down Yongbyon if he was going to slow-roll it, because committing to it in writing and then leaving himself vulnerable to being accused of violating it sets us on a collision course\u201d.\nFor the time being, Trump has shown no sign of a backlash against Kim in the face of Thursday\u2019s bitter disappointment. He made clear he still believed in the North Korean despot\u2019s good faith, even in the matter of the brutal and fatal torture of the US student Otto Warmbier in a North Korean prison.\nSome had feared that when it became clear Kim had no intention of giving up his nuclear arsenal Trump would resort to the threats and insults which helped bring the two countries to the brink of war in the summer and autumn of 2017.\nFor all the claims of his ghost-written book The Art of the Deal, Trump revealed himself to be a profoundly flawed negotiator who failed to understand his counterpart, and convinced himself only he could clinch an agreement, nuclear experts said.\nStephen Biegun, the US special representative for North Korea, who had taken part in preparatory talks with North Korean officials, was sidelined at the summit, his place at the table taken by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who has minimal foreign policy experience.\nBiegun\u2019s marginalisation was \u201cincredibly striking\u201d, said Alexandra Bell, a former state department arms control official.\n\u201cThe president has repeatedly signalled through word and deed that he doesn\u2019t really trust Biegun to lead this process,\u201d said Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. She recalled Trump\u2019s lack of concern about extensive vacancies at the state department when he said: \u201cI\u2019m the only one who matters.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be the case to the president, but it means no one can work ably on his behalf,\u201d she added. \u201cBased on his remarks at the press conference, he seemed to intimate that he thought we could secure a grand bargain and declare victory. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\u201d",

        "content": "Artistic director at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange appointed to new role and celebrated by Benedict Cumberbatch for her passion for increasing diversity\nSarah Frankcom, the newly appointed director of London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda), has said she will pursue \u201cradical solutions\u201d to recruit the next generation of actors from around the UK. Frankcom, who is currently the artistic director of Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange theatre, warned that the \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d is in a \u201cpretty fragile\u201d state and that \u201cdrama schools are still really, really monocultural places\u201d.\nIn a new role that replaces the posts of principal and CEO at Lamda, Frankcom will be responsible for leading the creative vision for the oldest drama school in the UK. She will oversee the training of the next generation of actors, directors, designers and technicians.\nTalking to the Guardian on Thursday, she said that world-class training is available for student actors in London \u201cbut it\u2019s not equitable regionally\u201d and that too many young people are unable to even contemplate relocating to the capital to train. The solution, she suggested, could be that the training is reimagined and takes place in different locations.\nWhile Lamda currently holds auditions in cities around the UK, including Manchester, Frankcom stressed that she is keen to do even more to open up careers in acting for people around the country. \u201cThe journey from Rochdale to the centre of Manchester in terms of miles is not very much,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in terms of mindset it can be an enormous journey for a lot of people.\u201d The prospect of a vocational career as an actor remains hidden from view for a lot of people, she added. \u201cThe opportunity here is to look at how we can find innovative, creative and maybe quite radical solutions to recruit students.\u201d\nFrankcom also highlighted the limitations within some drama schools\u2019 curriculums and spoke of the \u201cdeeply difficult\u201d situation for actors of colour, for example, to leave their training without having played someone of their own ethnicity. \u201cWhat excites me about leading this organisation is the opportunity to reimagine what is in the DNA of the repertoire that drama schools are exploring,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ca new repertoire to reflect a more diverse world\u201d could be a real \u201cgamechanger\u201d.\nShe will take up the role in November, as Lamda enters its first year as an independent higher-education provider. Lamda president Benedict Cumberbatch, who graduated from the academy in 2000 with an MA in classical acting, said he was \u201cthrilled at the prospect of working with Sarah, who has a passion for finding the best talent from whatever background and increasing diversity on stage and screen\u201d.\nFrankcom and Shaun Woodward, the chair of Lamda and former Labour MP for St Helens South in Merseyside, addressed other challenges for the industry including the lack of performing arts opportunities in many schools, the impact of Brexit on the diversity of actors training in the UK and the debt accrued by student actors. \u201cIf you go back 10 or 20 years, people would come to Lamda with virtually no debt or a tiny amount,\u201d said Woodward. \u201cNow, as with all drama schools, if you have a first degree you could well walk in the door with \u00a370-80,000 of debt, then you\u2019ll run up further debt learning the craft and living in London. We\u2019ve got ourselves into a place now where people might have a six-figure level of debt by the time they finish at drama school. What on earth does that do \u2013 if I think of my former constituency of St Helens \u2013 to a young man or woman who is 19 or 22? We have a responsibility to think about these issues.\u201d\nMany drama schools, said Frankcom, also placed \u201ctoo much value on the success of getting an agent and a job\u201d straight after graduation, rather than promoting the transferrable skills that training can offer. She stressed the importance of a more holistic approach.\nA former drama teacher, Frankcom joined the Royal Exchange as a literary manager. In 2005, she established the influential Bruntwood prize for playwriting. She became the theatre\u2019s co-artistic director in 2008 and took sole control in 2014. She is best known for directing Maxine Peake in a series of plays including bold takes on Hamlet, Happy Days and A Streetcar Named Desire and shows for the Manchester international festival including The Skriker. Her recent acclaimed productions include Our Town, staged with a community choir in the wake of the Manchester arena bombing, and Death of a Salesman, starring Don Warrington.\nThe Royal Exchange is known for its spaceship-like, in-the-round auditorium situated in the great hall of a Grade II-listed building, once the world\u2019s biggest cotton exchange. \u201cActors get a real workout in there,\u201d Frankcom told the Guardian in 2017. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the moment, if you\u2019re dialling it in, audiences find you out very quickly.\u201d\nWoodward said that Frankcom was \u201cone of the outstanding directors in the UK\u201d and that Lamda would encourage her to pursue outside projects that she was passionate about. Frankcom said she had no plans to stop directing, that her creative collaboration with Peake would continue and that she \u201ccan\u2019t wait to get her hands on\u201d the students.\nShe would miss the \u201cswagger\u201d and \u201ccultural leadership\u201d of Manchester, she said, and is looking forward to seeing what her successor will achieve. Her next production at the Royal Exchange will be a version of West Side Story with new choreography by Aletta Collins.",

Bulb is the first large supplier to pass those savings on to consumers.\nThe company said wholesale gas prices had fallen by 12% since December because relatively mild winter weather resulted in gas storage staying at healthy levels. Electricity prices have fallen by the same amount, as nearly half of the UK\u2019s electricity supplies come from gas power stations.\nAmit Gudka, one of Bulb\u2019s founders, said: \u201cHappily, the cost of supplying gas has continued to come down and we\u2019re now able to drop our gas rates. Due to increased network and policy costs for electricity, we aren\u2019t able to drop our electricity rates at the same time.\u201d\nThe company raised its tariff three times last year, blaming wholesale costs.\nThe energy regulator, Ofgem, said recently that wholesale prices had started to drop more dramatically at the start of February. If that trend continued, there was a reasonable chance the price cap would be lowered in October, said its chief executive, Dermot Nolan.\nBulb also announced it had hit the symbolic milestone of 1 million customers. That compares with 1.5 million at Ovo Energy, the largest challenger to the big six, which has grown rapidly after acquiring more than half a million customers from failed rivals.",

We do raise a concern that it will be almost three years since the outrage before this process actually starts.\u201d\nPaul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquest, told the hearing that the coroner, Sir John Saunders, could not begin hearing oral evidence until criminal proceedings had concluded.\nThe criminal prosecution is being delayed by efforts to extradite Hashem Abedi, the younger brother of the bomber Salman Abedi, from Libya where he is reportedly being held by a militia group. If he is returned to the UK he will face trial for 22 counts of murder, one of attempted murder and another of conspiracy to cause an explosion.\nWeatherby expressed concern that the families were not being kept updated by police and prosecutors about the status of the extradition. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that 20 months on after the outrage of the bombing families be provided with a greater level of factual data about the process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that the extradition request was made in November 2017.\n\u201cWhat we ask through you to the CPS and police is a plea for a greater amount of factual transparency.\u201d\nWeatherby said families wanted to know \u201cwhere are the proceedings up to, what has been achieved so far and what hurdles do there remain in the process of the extradition\u201d.\n\u201cWhere is Hashem Abedi?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause of course, given the situation in Libya, that is a matter of concern to the families. Is he in detention and is he in the detention of the UN-backed government in Tripoli or some other force?\u201d\nWeatherby added: \u201cThis is a call for some openness and transparency about where we have reached. The importance of the extradition is obvious.\u201d\nOutside court, Stephen Howe, the husband of victim Alison Howe, criticised the lack of information being given to the families and said he did not believe Abedi would ever be extradited.\n\u201cI feel as upset today as I did the day it happened,\u201d Howe said. \u201cThere was no update whatsoever today. I walked out of court. They did not give us any answers to any of our questions. There is no point sitting there listening to nothing.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt is very frustrating and very upsetting. I do not think they are getting anywhere with it. I am sure everyone is feeling frustrated and angry.\u201d\nJohn Cooper QC, representing 10 of the families, endorsed Weatherby\u2019s request for more information from the authorities.\nHe asked that the coroner be given unredacted copies of any classified government documents that might assist the inquest, such as information about the role of intelligence services in monitoring Abedi.\nCooper said the families wished to explore \u201cnot so much what information they [the security services] knew about the bomber but what they did once they had it\u201d.\nGreaney, for the coroner, read an update provided last week by Greater Manchester police and the Crown Prosecution Service which said only that the extradition process was \u201cin progress\u201d.\nThe update said that more than 100 police and prosecution staff were working on data to form part of the inquest, and that more than 300 statements had been taken since the previous pre-inquest hearing in October.\nJeremy Johnson QC, representing Greater Manchester police, said he would follow up the family\u2019s request with the force and the CPS.\nHe said a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d was in place once Abedi returns to the UK and that he would make arrangements to update the families either individually or as a group.\nCooper, for the families, said grieving relatives were also distressed by the appearance of the spot at Manchester Arena where Abedi detonated his bomb.\nHe said the location of the blast was \u201cawfully delineated\u201d so that it was obvious where the attack happened \u201ceach and every time you go in\u201d.\n\u201cWe have raised this with the arena but not sure we have got anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it to be properly repaired so that tragic spot is not constantly delineated every time people walk in there.\u201d",

Motassadeq maintained his innocence during his 2006 trial, which drew worldwide attention, and heard victim impact statements from relatives of those who died in the 9/11 attacks.\nHe claimed he had merely been a close friend of the men, but the court decided he had helped the cell with the logistics of planning their attacks, including keeping up rental payments once they had left for the US, in order to maintain the appearance that they were planning to return.\nHe is now believed to be living with relatives in Marrakesh and has refused to talk to reporters who have discovered his whereabouts.\nThe case is highly embarrassing for authorities in Hamburg who choreographed the departure on 15 October of the high-profile prisoner down to the last detail, having apparently planned it over several weeks. He was brought by masked special police to the airport, and in photographs published in the German media was shown smiling from his seat on the plane flanked by two police officers and surrounded by ordinary passengers on a Royal Air Maroc flight to Casablanca.\nHamburg\u2019s interior minister, Andy Grote, had said his departure was a sign that \u201cwe have drawn a line under this chapter\u201d.",

In fact, Cohen said he did not know any \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of collusion. \u201cBut I have my suspicions,\u201d he told members of Congress.\nTrump said of Cohen: \u201cHe lied a lot, but it was very interesting, because he didn\u2019t lie about one thing. He said no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, \u2018I wonder why he didn\u2019t just lie about that too, like he lied about everything else.\u2019\u201d\nCohen delivered a scathing account of his 10 years as Trump\u2019s enforcer, calling the president a racist conman, implicating him in a series of felonies and estimating that Cohen had threatened 500 people on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n  He said Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr, had been involved in a criminal conspiracy to pay hush money to a pornographic actor, Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had an affair with the elder Trump. Federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate.\nCohen confirmed that Trump was under federal investigation for undisclosed crimes and warned that Trump may try to cling to power even if his re-election campaign fails next year.\n  He also alleged that Trump knew in advance of plans by WikiLeaks to publish Democratic party emails, which US authorities say were stolen by Russian intelligence operatives, and that Donald Jr was to meet with Russians at Trump Tower.\nBut, Cohen said, he knew of no direct evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election campaign. US intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian operation was aimed at boosting Trump\u2019s chances.\nRobert Mueller, the special counsel, is concluding a two-year investigation into any links or coordination between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign. He has said Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, shared polling data with an alleged Russian intelligence operative.\nCohen said during his testimony that he saw \u201csomething odd\u201d about an affectionate back-and-forth Trump had with Vladimir Putin in public remarks over the years. \u201cThere are just so many dots that seem to lead in the same direction,\u201d he said.\nHe reiterated that Trump had lied repeatedly to the public during the 2016 election campaign by saying he had no business dealings with Russia. In fact, Cohen has told prosecutors, Trump was keenly pursuing a lucrative tower in Moscow until June 2016.\nCohen has previously testified that he spoke with an aide to Dmitry Peskov, one of Putin\u2019s most senior advisers, about securing approval for the tower project.\nTrump on Thursday repeated his assertion that Mueller\u2019s inquiry is a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d that was damaging to the country. He complained it was a \u201cterrible thing\u201d that Democrats had chosen to hold their hearing while he was at a summit overseas.\n\u201cThey could have made it two days later or next week and it would have been even better,\u201d said Trump.\nMueller is expected to pass a report on his findings to the attorney general, William Barr, next month. Barr is then obliged to notify senior members of Congress. But it remains unclear how much of Mueller\u2019s report will be made public.",

        "content": "NHS England calls for end to rules under which firms have won \u00a310.5bn of contracts\nNHS bosses have urged ministers to scrap controversial legislation that has led to the widespread privatisation of healthcare as part of a major revamp of the health service.\nNHS England outlined detailed plans that would repeal key parts of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to squeeze out private providers such as Virgin Care and let the NHS deliver more of its own care again.\nThe proposals include axing regulations that have allowed profit-driven health firms to win NHS contracts in England worth about \u00a310.5bn in the five years after the act came into force in April 2013.\nAt its monthly board meeting on Thursday, NHS England published plans that, if adopted by ministers, would dismantle large parts of the shake-up instigated by Andrew Lansley, who was health secretary in the coalition government from 2010 to 2012.\nTheresa May has acknowledged that the 2012 act, which is widely considered to be the most damaging ever to afflict the NHS, is hindering a drive by the health service in England to provide better care by integrating key services.\nSection 75 of the act and the public contracts regulations 2015 together force clinical commissioning groups in England \u2013 which hold the NHS budget locally \u2013 to put any contract for care worth more than \u00a3615,278 over its lifetime out to tender. That led to a significant expansion in the amount of care provided by firms such as Virgin Care and Care UK.\nVirgin Care, which is owned by Richard Branson, holds more than 400 contracts.\nIn a document outlining its ideas, NHS England said: \u201cWe propose that the regulations made under section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 should be revoked.\u201d It instead called for a \u201cbest value\u201d test.\nIt said the increased competition arising from the regulations has wasted NHS time and resources. \u201cCurrent procurement legislation can lead to protracted procurement processes and wasteful legal and administration costs in cases where there is a strong rationale for services to be provided by NHS organisations, for instance to secure integration with existing NHS services.\u201d\nNHS England has launched a two-month public engagement process on its proposals. The Commons health and social care select committee will also hold an inquiry and carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of whatever proposals for reform ministers put forward.\nSimon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, said it wanted to see \u201cif some targeted changes could be made to the law\u201d.\nPaul Evans, who runs the NHS Support Federation, which tracks privatisation in the health service, welcomed the move. \u201cThe Lansley reforms have been a damaging and wasteful experiment in forcing competition on the NHS and inviting in the private sector.\n\u201cThe market-based experiment has led to the collapse of multiple contracts, to patients getting substandard care or the denial of it altogether, and to the huge waste of public resources.\u201d\nNHS England made clear that the ambitions outlined in its long-term plan, the blueprint it unveiled last month, could be implemented under existing legislation, \u201cbut legislative change could make implementation easier and faster\u201d.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, said: \u201cWe want to help foster an even more ambitious, innovative culture in the NHS and ensure it\u2019s never victim to unnecessary bureaucracy. We are prepared to consider what changes may be necessary to make those ambitions a reality more quickly, including potentially changing the law.\u201d\nNiall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents most health service trusts, backed the plan. \u201cMany aspects of the 2012 NHS reforms are no longer fit for purpose. These proposals should remove some of the barriers to effective collaboration [and] reduce the burden of the current procurement regime.\u201d\nUnder the proposals, the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s power to block mergers between hospital trusts would transfer to the regulator NHS Improvement. This is likely to lead to a series of mergers, some of which the CMA has rejected.",

        "content": "Radical map changes and fun pirate-themed skins give a fresh look to counter strong competition from Apex Legends \nThe latest season of Fortnite is now live, introducing a major new volcano area, as well as a host of pirate-themed locations and features.\nSeason 8 kicked off early on Thursday morning with the arrival of a gigantic volcano in the north east of the island, spewing lava along various large channels. This fiery liquid dishes out damage to players who step in it (and makes them bounce), providing a new environmental hazard.\nThere are also various thermal vents around the mountain, and in the mouth of the volcano itself, which send players soaring into the air \u2013 allowing for quick getaways. A network of swooping rope slides down the sides of the volcano are also set to aid in player movement \u2013 an important addition as two other transport options, the shopping trolley and the X-4 Stormwing, have been removed for the time being.\nNearby, a new Lazy Lagoon area features a vast lake dotted with islands and an explorable pirate ship, which is loaded with loot chests. To the east is Sunny Steps, an Aztec-themed temple complex clinging to the sides of the volcano, offering some claustrophobic corridors to race through in order to reach treasure rooms. It\u2019s already proving a popular start point for loot-hungry players.\nThe most visible new weapon is the cannon, which will fire both cannon balls and players large distances, providing both destruction and transportation benefits. It\u2019s a feature that will remind many of multiplayer online game Sea of Thieves, which also lets players shoot themselves from cannon. Indeed, a lot of the new pirate-themed items and areas bear a close resemblance to Rare\u2019s title, especially the pirate ship itself, which features a captain\u2019s cabin, complete with treasure map.\nFurther additions are sure to be discovered as players explore further (it seems, for example, that Titled Towers has not survived the recent earthquakes unscathed). A series of teaser tweets issued just before the update hinted that the dragon eggs dotted around the island may well be about to hatch \u2013 it\u2019s possible players will find themselves flying around on dragons at some point in the next two months. The new season also comes with 100 new emotes and skins, including ninja and pirate costumes as well as more comedic options such as a banana outfit.\nAn important addition for players interested in maxing out their Battle Pass levels is the Party Assist feature, which allows daily and weekly challenges to be completed with the help of everyone in your party. Epic has also improved its in-game marker system, which allows players to tap on the d-pad to mark a position on the landscape \u2013 it now gives a distance to the selected area or item. In a recent AMA session on Reddit, the Fortnite team hinted that it would be adding more features to assist in developing squad-based tactics \u2013 an idea no doubt designed to compete with battle royale newcomer Apex Legends, which boasts much more intuitive non-verbal communication in the form of its Ping contextual commands system.\nIt\u2019s a fairly major update then, with lots of new gameplay features and possibilities and interesting story elements to discover. But with increased competition from Apex Legends, which already boasts 25m players, Epic Games will have to continue its punishing production line of additions and amendments.\nFortnite Battle Royale is now 18 months old \u2013 an eon in the world of online multiplayer gaming. The industry will be watching closely to see if this volcano will cause enough of an explosion to keep players \u2013 and, crucially, high-profile YouTubers and Twitch streamers \u2013 playing along.",

        "content": "Royal Academy, LondonNaked men cruise, fight and flagellate, nude nymphs brandish whips, and creatures ambush sleeping maidens. What an astonishing show \u2013 I could look all day\nFull of surprises, and a few shocks, sexy, sacred and profane, The Renaissance Nude is almost as salacious as it is scholarly. With substantial loans from all over Europe and the US, the exhibition has travelled from the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and now fills the Sackler galleries at the Royal Academy.\nIt is a riot of bodies in these low-lit, sober grey rooms. Christian martyrs are impaled on trees. Jan Gossaert\u2019s Christ, stripped, awaits his fate, sitting on the cold stone and wracked with palpable terror. Several Saint Sebastians stand about, pin-up boys oblivious to the arrows that pierce them. A procession of flagellants in a Netherlandish Book of Hours prepare themselves for their hooded tormentors in a scene as erotic as it is devotional. The delicacy and intimacy of the image counterpoints its impending violence. Titian\u2019s Venus Anadyomene rises from the waters, wringing her hair, fully exposed and oblivious to the spectator. Peering to the side, she doesn\u2019t see us looking, or pretends as much. Perhaps this is Titian\u2019s double bluff (she knows that we know \u2026 except of course, she is only painted).\nMantegna\u2019s battling sea gods are all muscles and snarls and shouts, while Bosch-like creatures creep up on a sleeping pair of young women on a beach, a city burning on the far shore, in Marcantonio Raimondi\u2019s 1507-8 engraving. Filled with detail, the crepuscular image is a nightmarish pastoral of fanciful architecture, the silence of slumber and the cacophony of the besieged city. The little monsters complete the over-the-top scene. I could look at this all day. Naked men hack at each other with sabres, axes, swords and daggers in a wonderful roundelay of violence in Antonio del Pollaiuolo\u2019s 1470s engraving Battle of the Nudes. Their nakedness, it is suggested, is an association with animalistic barbarity rather than heroism, or a return to a fanciful antiquity. I was not expecting so much violence, or so much implied sex of all kinds. Saint Jerome, butt naked, tears at his skin with a stone in a polychromed wood sculpture by Donatello (though there seems to be some dispute over his authorship), which shows the saint attempting to distract himself from the temptations of the flesh. I begin to know how he feels.\nBaptism was a pretext for Luca Signorelli to paint male buttocks. A woman pleasures herself in Giulio Campagnola\u2019s 1508-9 engraving. The saved walk towards heaven, decorously draped, while naked sinners tumble into hell, to be ravaged by demons in Dieric Bouts\u2019 1468-9 diptych. Painted in oil or tempera, engraved, etched, printed using woodcuts, drawn, carved and cast, flesh is made malleable by the pressure to dramatise and to exaggerate, to tell stories, to educate, edify and to horrify, to tickle the fancy and to appeal to the kinks in the Renaissance mind. Even without the dominance of the Catholic church, the politics of representation are as vexed today as they were in Renaissance Europe.\nFocusing on the period 1400-1530, and with works from France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, the exhibition shows us that the variety of approaches to the naked body is almost as diverse as the artists who depicted them, let alone the variety of human bodies themselves. In extremis, in flagrante, inflammatory, indecent, idealised, implausible, pagan, mythological, Christian, humanist and abject, the exhibition seems to contain far more than the space it occupies can handle. I fear that the Renaissance Nude will be almost impossible to look at, given the number of actual bodies these galleries might well contain if the exhibition is anything like as popular as it deserves to be. Modern bodies are no less unruly than their Renaissance counterparts. There is so much here to astonish, and much that deserves close looking.\nIn Pisanello\u2019s 1426 drawing Luxuria, a distorted naked woman with big hair lounges, displaying herself to the viewer. We read that women were hardly ever drawn from life before the 1470s, but modelled instead from male models, mannikins and other artworks. But her androgyny is more, I think, than a by-product or a matter of insufficient information. Whatever scholarship discovers, there are always ambiguities.\nIn German artist Hans Baldung\u2019s 1513 woodcut Aristotle and Phyllis, we see Phyllis, naked, riding side-saddle on the back of the equally naked old philosopher, as he crawls around the garden. She carries a little whip, he wears a bit. He turns to acknowledge the viewer. Phyllis\u2019s lover Alexander watches from above. Baldung is also represented here by a naked Christ, in a state between death and resurrection, turning on the ground to look up, impeachingly, and as if he has just awoken, and with one hand between his legs, perhaps for comfort, perhaps to check that he is intact, perhaps to signal his vulnerability. You can almost sense the cramp in his legs. Baldung was Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s student, and one of the most surprising works here is D\u00fcrer\u2019s bathhouse scene, a crowded woodcut depicting male cruising and voyeurism in an outdoor bathhouse in 1496. The ribald scene is as unexpected as it is humorous.\nThe sacred and profane, linear time and circular time and the end of time \u2013 all are at play here, along with the devotional and the rational, the irrational and the mythological. A return to Greek and Roman myth was as much a cover for more pressing and immediate preoccupations than it was to present erudite allegories. Two handsome smooth boys hang about in Arcadia. Daphnis, Apollo\u2019s protege, sits naked on a rock playing a sort of flute. Apollo looks on, his tresses blown by some doubtless fragrant waft of air. Some birds who don\u2019t know how to fly pass overhead (it is as if someone has thrown them there). In the distance is a city, people crossing a bridge, a rider on horseback. Are they all naked too? It both is and isn\u2019t 1495 in Perugino\u2019s painting. Time has somehow lost its bearings, and so have we. Who knows what will happen next? What a great show this is, how thought-provoking, mysterious, and nearly modern.\n At the Royal Academy, London, from 3 March to 2 June.",

In part, it\u2019s autobiographical, digging down into Christian\u2019s own experience of mixed heritage. One side of her family has deep roots in the Isle of Man, while the other hails from China via Malaysia. But it also excavates some of the bloodiest episodes of the last century, scraping away at received historical narratives.\nThe title is a reference to the Chinese city of the same name, which was brutally invaded by the imperial Japanese army in 1937. Brutal, indeed, feels like too mild a word for the atrocities Christian describes. But this is no simple telling of a history that remains relatively unknown in the UK. The narrative of Nanjing is complicated by Christian, revealing the tangled threads that tie it to other human-made horrors.\nThough better known as a director, Christian is a delicate and thoughtful writer, deftly handling the moral complexity of her material. She asks us what we would die for, what we would kill for, what we would forgive.\nNanjing is a show that dwells in the grey, avoiding extremes of black and white while recognising the appeal of absolutes.\nIf it sounds like a detached academic exercise, Elayce Ismail\u2019s production is far from it. The show has a quiet, measured sense of ritual, building a meditative but haunting mood. A large white sheet becomes shroud, dress and billowing mushroom cloud, while carefully placed rocks both mark and mourn the lives Christian remembers. At the end, as she sets down the final stone, her central question lingers: how far would you go to fight for peace? \nAt the Royal Exchange, Manchester, until 2 March",

        "content": "As the 25th anniversary of the release of Selected Ambient Works Volume II approaches, we take a look at Richard D James\u2019s back catalogue, from disorientating acid-house bangers to dreamy, if unsettling melodies\nThis epic glitch-fest sounds just as weird now as it did two decades ago. Chris Cunningham\u2019s bizarre music video \u2013 complete with a Michael Jackson-style dance number, a foul-mouthed extended director\u2019s version and a small army of women who all have Richard D James\u2019s face \u2013 will continue to spawn nightmares for years to come.\nThis plaintive piano ballad from the unjustly maligned Drukqs album has had a long half-life in popular culture, appearing in everything from films by Sofia Coppola (it\u2019s in Marie Antoinette) and Spike Jonze (Her) to being sampled by Kanye West for Blame Game on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\nKlopjob is an inviting slab of squiggly, melodic electro from the 2005 Analord series of 11 12in singles. It ping-pongs back and forth from happy-go-lucky to dark and dystopian.\nThis impressive early track \u2013 released in 1992, and added to the 1994 Classics compilation \u2013 ably splits the difference between the boundless deep spaces of Detroit techno and the propulsive power of the breakbeat.\nA delicate melody floats over effervescent beats and a white noise snare in this captivating early track from the third volume of Aphex\u2019s fan-favourite Analogue Bubblebath series. Originally packaged in bubble wrap with no liner notes and a sticker reading \u201c66% more bubbles\u201d, (CAT 00897 AA1) [Fluted] is Aphex at his most playful.\nSparkling synthesised melodies pair with stuttering, almost ungainly beats, showing off Aphex\u2019s endless capacity for creating rhythmic and textural contrast. The music video was directed by Jarvis Cocker, who created a stop-motion mash-up of Aphex imagery, and also shot a video for fellow Warp stalwart LFO.\nThis dazzling cascade of ricocheting rhythms shows off Aphex\u2019s considerable technical skill and range as a producer. According to Autechre\u2019s Sean Booth, it is a response to their similarly trippy track Drane. The surprise melody that surfaces inside the controlled chaos is an added bonus.\nSelected Ambient Works 85-92 is packed full of classics. Pretty much any track from this album could appear here \u2013 from Pulsewidth to Ptolemy to We Are the Music Makers \u2013 but the stately, expansive Heliosphan is a particular high point.\nA lot of great 90s electronic music sounded like it was playing underwater \u2013 from the deep dubby undertow of Berlin\u2019s Basic Channel, to hugely influential Detroit pioneers Drexciya, and the disorienting \u201cambient house\u201d of the Orb. In Tha, Aphex\u2019s beats are heavily cloaked in murk, and the melody sounds partially submerged, slowly surfacing as the track progresses.\nThis unlikely marriage of gracefully plucked strings and frenzied programmed beats is one of Aphex\u2019s best-loved tunes. The clashing timbres and styles could easily sound discordant, but here they blend together seamlessly.\nA disorienting acid-house banger that doubles as a kind of satire on hippy ravers \u2013 a friend asked Aphex to write it to clear their Cornish beach parties once dawn broke. Unlike most hippy Cornish beach parties, Digeridoo contains no actual didgeridoo; those cavernous, woody tones were all synthesised.\nThis stirring, slow-burning anthem appeared on the vinyl and cassette versions of Selected Ambient Works Vol II, but was strangely left off the CD version. On YouTube the tune lives on, with millions of views and thousands of comments discussing everything from the vastness of the universe to monoliths and existential despair.\nAnother track that shows off Aphex Twin\u2019s flair for writing a melody that sticks hard to the brainpan. Alberto Balsalm \u2013 named after the shampoo, the song also includes the sound of Aphex cutting his hair \u2013 ambles along at a genial pace; you can actually click your fingers to this one.\nLike most of the songs Aphex released under his Polygon Window moniker, this is a straight-up hard techno banger propelled by clattering industrial rhythms and enough propulsive force to break through a brick wall.\nMuch of Selected Ambient Works Vol II was inspired by lucid dreaming, according to interviews Aphex gave at the time. And Blue Calx is one of the dreamiest tracks on the double album \u2013 an airy melody underpinned by a gentle rhythm that could lull even the most defiant insomniac to sleep.\nIn the unforgettable opener to Selected Ambient Works Vol II, known by fans as Cliffs, a childlike voice loops over a gentle melody. It is soothing and slightly unsettling at the same time, traversing the same hallucinatory memoryscape that would be mined by fellow electronic explorers such as Boards of Canada.\nAgeispolis, from Selected Ambient Works 85-92, has a grand, cinematic sweep. Tightly arranged with an acute sense of pacing and drama, it shows Aphex\u2019s considerable talent as a songwriter as well as a producer.\nCode-named Rhubarb by fans, this wistful melody from Selected Ambient Works Vol II repeats and slowly builds, moving gently outwards like ripples of water in a lake. The deceptively simple ambient track somehow conjures powerful images; many listeners report feeling deep waves of nostalgia.\nThis gorgeous, sombre closing track came as a surprise on the mostly dark and frenetic Come to Daddy EP. The only problem is that it clocks in at just under three minutes; it\u2019s not nearly long enough.\nAphex is known for his deviant humour and aggressively disorientating arrangements, but Analogue Bubblebath is one of those timeless tracks that convey incredible emotional depth, expressing multiple feelings in perfect synchrony: it\u2019s melancholy and uplifting, moody and hopeful, ecstatic and forlorn, all at the same time. A radiant anthem with a softer side, it still stands as a gold standard for electronic music nearly 30 years after its initial release.\nActors\nActors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine's best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Jane Fonda's 10 best films - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Every Angelie Jolie film performance - ranked!Nicole Kidman\u2019s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren's 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford's greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder's 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Maggie Smith's 20 best films \u2013 ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson's best films - ranked!\nDirectors\nWes Anderson movies - ranked!The Coen brothers\u2019 films - ranked!Stanley Kubrick's best films - ranked!\nMovie genres\nBiopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d'Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The best Stephen King movies\u00a0 - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films \u2013 ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!\nStudios & franchises\nAardman's 20 best films \u2013 ranked!James Bond on film \u2013 007's best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film  - ranked!\nTV & award shows\nThe 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock & Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan's toast to Russell Crowe\u2019s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!\nSingles\nAll Abba's UK singles - ranked!The Beatles' singles \u2013 ranked!Kate Bush \u2013 every UK single - ranked!Every one of Madonna's 78 singles - ranked!Missy Elliott's solo singles \u2013 ranked!Prince's 50 greatest singles \u2013 ranked!Queen's 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift's singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!\nAlbums\nBlack Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne \u2013 (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis's 20 greatest albums \u2013 ranked!Lil Wayne's albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Joni Mitchell's albums \u2013 ranked!The Rolling Stones \u2013 every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen's albums - ranked!Kanye West \u2013 every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder's albums - ranked!\nSongs\n20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin's best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow \u2013 all his greatest songs - ranked!Bj\u00f6rk \u2013 her 20 greatest songs ranked!Cher's 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs \u2013\u00a0ranked!Elton John's 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!PJ Harvey's 50 greatest songs \u2013 ranked!Giorgio Moroder's 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana's 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!\nArtists & bands\nThe 30 best boyband members - ranked!The greatest Scottish indie bands - ranked!Quincy Jones's greatest ever moments  - ranked!",

It said there was \u201ca real risk of an increase in episodes of intolerance towards foreigners\u201d.\nIt warned that assaults by neo-fascist and Nazi groups against migrants \u201ccould intensify with the approach of the European elections\u201d and said a probable increase in clashes between anti-fascist and far-right groups could cause serious public order problems.\nThe intelligence agency report said the Italian far right was characterised in 2018 \u201cby a pronounced vitality\u201d and an increase in xenophobic propaganda \u201cfocused on the opposition to migration.\u201d\nSeparate figures from the anti-racist organisation Lunaria, which publishes quarterly reports on the number of racially motivated attacks in Italy, counted 126 physical attacks, especially against migrants, in 2018. It had recorded 27 racially motivated attacks in 2016 and 46 in 2017.\nThe latest racist aggression dates back to last Tuesday, when a woman from Ivory Coast was attacked in Bari, in the south of Italy, by men and women who kicked and punched her while shouting racist insults. In Naples two days before, two boys aged 10 and 13 sprayed a 51-year-old man from Benin with pepper spray.\n\u201cIn Italy, xenophobia is growing exponentially,\u201d the director of the national anti-discrimination office at the ministry of equal opportunities, Luigi Manconi, told the Guardian.\n\u201cIn the background, there is an economic and social crisis where foreigners are perceived as the cause and, as a consequence, migrants become real scapegoats. It is a worrying phenomenon also because the institutions tend to feed it with knee-jerk reactions and irresponsible gestures.\u201d\nOpposition politicians and aid groups have accused the Italian minister of the interior and far-right leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, of creating a climate of hate following the attacks, which have coincided with an anti-migration drive that has included closing Italian ports to NGO rescue boats and a vow to expel migrants.\nSalvini has claimed \u201cthe wave of racism is simply an invention of the left.\u201d Lunaria\u2019s figures from 2018 recorded 12 shootings, two murders and 33 physical assaults against migrants in the first two months since Salvini entered government.",

Splosh! is \u201ca mellow comedy\u201d, he says, summoning hypnopompia, the state of consciousness between asleep and awake.

Clad in turquoise swimwear, he tells us about his cheerleader dad, underwater archaeologist mum (\u201cwe only saw her when the tide went out\u201d) and his sister, who joins Ben on the Houston swim squad. Delivered with fluting voice and staring eyes while prowling among his audience, Target\u2019s Speedo-thin narrative never gets near the fast lane, as our host diverts into absurdist quizzes, doodles of fish and invitations to the audience to pelt him with ping-pong balls.\nSo it is a tonal jolt when Splosh! is recast on a dime as Target\u2019s response to a traumatic incident from his adolescence.

The premiere of his third opera, The Knot Garden, at Covent Garden in 1969, had been a huge success. He had also tapped into a totally new audience in the US, which he first visited in 1965, and where he returned regularly for the rest of his life. The Third Symphony reflects his new enthusiasm for American culture, with its vocal finale in which a soprano soloist, partnered by a flugelhorn, sings a series of blues. It\u2019s intended to offer a 20th-century response to the expressions of universal brotherhood proclaimed by the finale of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth, which Tippett quotes in his own last movement.\nSo much of Tippett\u2019s output has become unfashionable in the 20 years since his death, it\u2019s reassuring to discover how well the Third Symphony still stands up, both musically and idealistically, in a far more cynical age. Martyn Brabbins and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, completing a cycle of Tippett symphonies they began last year with the First and Second, propel it with an almost confrontational sinewy intensity, with every texture crisply defined. Rachel Nicholls is the feisty soprano soloist in the finale, which is almost a dramatic scena, looking back to the world of The Knot Garden, and especially to its character of \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d Denise.\nAs this recording shows, though, the symphony is a far more robust, less modish achievement than the opera, and one much more likely to persist in the repertoire. But Brabbins and the orchestra cannot make such a convincing case for the birth-to-death span of the Fourth Symphony, premiered in 1977. It seems to lack the substance of its predecessors, being more an orchestral display piece (it was composed for Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony) than a tough-minded symphonic argument.\nBrabbins\u2019 two discs now line up against the only previous cycles on disc, by Richard Hickox for Chandos, and a Decca set that\u2019s shared between performances under Colin Davis (for the first three symphonies) and Solti (for the Fourth). All three have their different merits, but Hyperion offers a bonus with the first ever recording of Tippett\u2019s Symphony in B flat, premiered in 1934 but withdrawn after a handful of performances, and not heard again until Brabbins revived it last year.\nFundamentally neo-Romantic, indebted to Sibelius and with few hints of the direction Tippett\u2019s music might take over the next decade, it\u2019s now a historical curiosity more than anything else, but rounds out the survey nicely.",

Recently separated, subtly scarred Sarah (Se\u00e1na Kerslake) installs herself and young son Chris (James Quinn Markey) in the kind of countryside fixer-upper-type property that conventionally serves as a magnet for trouble. Yet its foundations are undermined in unexpected fashion, first by the discovery of a vast sinkhole in the surrounding forest, then by the neighbourhood crone (Kaurism\u00e4ki regular Kati Outinen) who pauses her catatonic murmuring to insist that Chris isn\u2019t who he seems. As Sarah briefs one confidante: \u201cIt\u2019s been a funny few days.\u201d\nThe bathos in that aside testifies to the care director Lee Cronin and co-writer Stephen Shields take to describe a semi-functional household against which the mounting weirdness can be more starkly defined. It\u2019s there in the way Sarah strips wallpaper with a kitchen spatula, and Chris\u2019s rejection of parmesan as \u201cdust cheese\u201d; it\u2019s there again in the appearance of James Cosmo, bringing his usual stout Celtic solidity to bear in the role of Outinen\u2019s desperate-distraught spouse.\nFor a good, enthralling hour, we\u2019re uncertain whether the real threat facing this household comes from within or without. The sinkhole is a nifty feat of VFX that exerts a strange pull, but there\u2019s also the curious cuckoo-in-the-nest business \u2013 and young Markey was surely cast for his uncanny resemblances to Sixth Sense-era Haley Joel Osment and The Shining\u2019s Danny Lloyd.\nCronin sometimes leans a little heavily on the Kubrickisms \u2013 Sarah tempts fate on repapering the hall with a pattern recalling the Overlook\u2019s carpets \u2013 but transcends mere homage by providing us with the resources to invest in these characters.\nThe terrific Kerslake gives an anchoring performance, suggesting a slightly young-seeming mother beginning to question the evidence of her own tranquilliser-heavy eyes and having to trust her instincts anew. It\u2019s a film in animated conversation with genre history \u2013 even a casual survey of that sinkhole might discern traces of Carrie White\u2019s corpse, The Descent\u2019s doomed spelunkers and the victims of The Vanishing. Yet it always finds new, invariably cinematic ways to nudge us towards its final leap into the abyss. Cronin feels like a real find for our especially insecure moment.",

Sporadic protests over tax rises are continuing, showing the government\u2019s limited room for manoeuvre.\nThe IMF-backed programme has been described as the most draconian anywhere in the world since the financial crash, dwarfing the cutbacks in public spending seen even in Portugal, and broadly matching those in Greece. The aim of the conference was to showcase Jordan\u2019s potential as a country in which to invest rather than raise aid.\nAt one point, the summer riots in its capital, Amman, led to unfounded rumours that the king might abdicate amid signs that members of the Jordanian royal family were circling to succeed him.\nJordan is suffering 39% youth unemployment, possesses few natural resources and is burdened with 1.3 million Syrian refugees on top of longstanding Palestinian refugees.\nJordan, although touted as a source of political stability in an unstable region, is on its seventh prime minister since 2011, with critics claiming the king uses his ministers as a lightning rod for his own unpopular policies.\nThe current prime minister, Omar al-Razzaz, appointed after the street protests and a former World Bank economist, insists Jordan\u2019s economy is showing signs of an upturn, but the fear is that if the fiscal consolidation is not accompanied by export-led growth and private sector investment, sizeable street protests will recommence.\nEconomic growth in the 10 year prior to 2009 was 6.5%, but fell to 2.5% in the following nine years.\nMany of the country\u2019s most skilled workers have left for Saudi Arabia or increasingly Turkey. But Saudi Arabia is also trying to address its unemployment issues by substituting indigenous labour in jobs previously done by migrants. The London conference heard that for every 100 Jordanian managers working in Jordan, 80 are currently working in Saudi Arabia.\nA further exodus is likely to occur if Jordan cannot change the structure of its economy. Educated women are pouring out of Jordan\u2019s universities but are unlikely to be accommodated in the current public sector structures.\nEconomic planners have attempted to highlight what they say are Jordan\u2019s strengths: a skilled young workforce, strength in services, access to markets and commitment to green energy.\nKing Abdullah told the conference \u201cthe world understands the importance of a strong and prosperous Jordan\u201d, insisting the country has the resilience to withstand the turmoil in the region. He said it \u201cwas a centrepiece for the values in which the world depends on mutual respect, moderation and inter-faith harmony\u201d.\nMay praised Jordan\u2019s role as a steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism and announced the UK was underwriting a $250m World Bank loan to make it easier for Jordan to borrow at lower interest rates. It would also invest in helping young Jordanians learn the English language, she said.\nThere was little open discussion of political reform in Jordan at the conference. The government is appointed by the King and parliament has a largely consultative role.",

        "content": "May has struck gold in finding a Brexit secretary so comfortable with his own mediocrity\nSquare peg, square hole. Neither David Davis nor Dominic Raab had worked out particularly well as Brexit secretaries. Davis because he was naturally lazy and fatally dim, Raab because he was under the impression his job was significant. With Steve Barclay, the prime minister has struck gold. A man bright enough to know he\u2019s irrelevant, but too stupid to realise that might be a drawback. A man entirely comfortable with his own mediocrity. A minister of no importance.\nAll of which has turned Brexit departmental questions into a Jim Hacker tribute act. Albeit one that has begun to slightly pall with each revival. There\u2019s only so much fun to be had from sitting in the Commons chamber listening to ministers going out of their way to make clear that their main function was to know nothing about anything. Just 12 Tory backbenchers bothered to show up this time. If it were down to them, Brexit questions would be downsized to a committee room.\nThere are still some opposition MPs who happen to believe that Brexit is the biggest crisis facing the country since the last war and that with under 30 days to go before the UK leaves the EU, it might be a good idea to have some kind of plan. Barclay appeared genuinely bewildered by this. No one had ever said Brexit would be good for the country, so why all the fuss? There was a bad deal and a worse deal. Que ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1.\nThis response didn\u2019t go down as well as the Brexit secretary had hoped, and he was soon facing follow-up questions from Labour about what progress on cross-party talks had been made. Barclay shrugged. How the hell would he know? He was only the Brexit secretary. This kind of information was strictly limited to everyone but him. But he could confirm that some people from different parties may have talked to one another. And it was possible Brexit might have come up in these discussions.\nHilary Benn, chair of the Brexit select committee, tried to discover if Barclay had heard the same rumours as him that the EU had no intention of removing the Northern Ireland backstop. This time Barclay was incredulous. Though he had been to Brussels, he had never actually met anyone there. Eurostar had been offering cheap winter deals and he and his team had popped over for lunch a couple of times.\nThereafter, he was happy to run through a whole range of other topics that he knew nothing about. No, he couldn\u2019t say how the government was going to vote if it came to no deal because not even Theresa May had that information and in any case he was sure he was going to vote for the deal that he had voted against the last time by backing the Brady amendment. Apart from anything else, it was terribly confusing having to choose between voting \u201caye\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and he couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of doing a Chris Grayling and wandering into the wrong lobby.\nThe junior ministers Kwasi Kwarteng and Chris Heaton-Harris have also drunk the departmental ignorance Kool-Aid. Kwarteng was happy to confirm that though he had never actually met a worker he was delighted to confirm that the Tories would really, really care about workers until after a few Labour MPs voted with the government in the middle of next week. Heaton-Harris insisted that people had voted for Brexit to make themselves poorer and was determined to deliver on that commitment.\nRobin Walker was rather cagier. He has been in the Brexit department since it was created and has seen countless colleagues come and go. So he has learned to avoid it all by taking out US citizenship. Every time he is asked a question he pleads the fifth amendment, claiming he can\u2019t possibly confirm or deny anything as it might later incriminate him. He can feel the clammy breath of a Chilcot-style inquiry on his neck and is watching his back. He\u2019s not quite as stupid as he looks.\nWe ended, as these sessions so often now do, in farce. First Heaton-Harris tried to claim that by trying to avoid no deal, the SNP was secretly backing it. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition! And that because the government was keeping no deal on the table, it was secretly trying to make to make sure there was no deal.\nThen Barclay chipped in with the observation that the government could not be accused of running down the clock because the space-time continuum was outside cabinet control. They both sounded like a couple of old stoners. The Brexit secretary left the chamber in triumph. He could be a hero. Just for one day.",

Thousands of students across Algeria joined the protests on Tuesday, voicing demands that Bouteflika drop his bid for re-election, calling him unfit to rule.\nAt least 15 journalists were briefly arrested on Thursday in the capital, Algiers, during a protest demanding an end to censorship, where police assaulted journalists holding signs that read \u201cno to the muzzling of the press\u201d and against Bouteflika\u2019s rule. The demonstration was the second of its kind in a week after journalists for the country\u2019s national television and radio service protested on Tuesday to demand their employers allow them to cover the mood of dissent gripping Algeria.\nHamza Zait, a journalist and political scientist who attended Thursday\u2019s demonstration, said that Algerian police detained the journalists in an oft-used tactic to disperse and repress protests. \u201cThe protest was organised by a number of journalists to say no to Bouteflika\u2019s candidacy, and also that the press in Algeria must be free. Right now, the press in Algeria isn\u2019t exactly free \u2013 it\u2019s manipulated, and they came to say that this needs to change and the press must be respected,\u201d he said.\nAs hundreds and on some occasions thousands defied a protest ban in the capital, the country\u2019s fractured and sometimes co-opted political opposition attempted to coalesce around a single candidate to challenge Bouteflika in the forthcoming April election by harnessing the anger of the protests. But as protesters and politicians alike voiced a collective dislike of Bouteflika, no single candidate has yet managed to unify both elements around a vision beyond changing the president. Equally unclear is whether the election could quell the protests, fuelled by angry younger people in a country where more than a quarter of people under 30 are unemployed.\nDjilali told the Guardian that Mouwatana would not back any candidate in the election. \u201cThe street doesn\u2019t support a candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe election was organised with the aim of Bouteflika\u2019s candidacy. We don\u2019t want to legitimise a fake result, given that the rules of the game are neither transparent nor democratic.\u201d\nThis has not stopped some of those vying to beat Bouteflika from attempting to harness the momentum of the protests for their electoral campaigns as potential candidates race to gather the 60,000 signatures needed to officially compete.\n\u201cIf I go out into my village, in under a minute there\u2019ll be 1,000 people out there to support me. No one here has the confidence of the Algerian youth, apart from me,\u201d said Rachid Nekkaz, a pro-business candidate who boasts an online following of more than 1.5 million people. Nekkaz, a Paris-born property tycoon, renounced his French citizenship in order to run in Algeria and became known as the \u201cZorro of the niqab\u201d after reportedly paying \u00a3270,000 in fines for French and Belgian women who defied a ban on face veils.\nNekkaz\u2019s fondness for publicity initially led many to treat him as a joke candidate. However, in a phone call to the Guardian he described how he had been confined to de facto house arrest last weekend after being hounded by Algerian police while campaigning. \u201cEverywhere the youth carry me on their shoulders \u2013 it\u2019s why the powers are scared,\u201d he said. Still, he added, his first act if elected would be a political amnesty law to safeguard those now in power. \u201cMy first objective is stability,\u201d he said.\nA photo of a grinning Nekkaz joining hands with other opposition figures circulated online on Tuesday evening, evidence of a second failed meeting to choose a single candidate despite the goodwill.\nThe TV presenter and potential candidate Ghani Mahdi, also pictured at the meeting, attracted the support of Khalil Benkhelfi, a student who took part in protests at his university in the town of Constantine. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the current regime. We want a radical change in this country, to break through the wall of restrictions,\u201d he said, adding that his entire class intends to vote in April, unlike in previous elections. Mahdi, he explained, \u201cuncovered the truth about the system, unlike other candidates who we only see during elections\u201d.\nTop Algerian officials have begun to grudgingly acknowledge the daily protests. Following power struggles within the ruling elite, speculation has grown that the leadership could back a different candidate to succeed Bouteflika in order to ensure the stability of the governing regime and to cool tensions.\n\u201cThe president is a red line,\u201d the chairman of the ruling National Liberation Front, Mouad Bouchareb, told a group of party officials on Wednesday, days after the prime minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, provided the first official recognition of the discontent. \u201cEveryone has the right to support their candidate, and be against any other candidate. The ballot box will decide in a peaceful and civilised way,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat Algerians are screaming for is more dignity,\u201d said Dr Dalia Ghanem-Yazbeck of the Carnegie Middle East Center. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want this fifth term to happen, they want another candidate. What they really want is unclear, but they know what they don\u2019t want,\u201d she said. \u201cAlgerians loathe how their country is perceived abroad, this international image of a sick president unable to talk to people for years.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Adham Youssef\n This article was amended on 1 March 2019 to clarify in the first paragraph that Soufiane Djilali is one of the organisers of protests in Algeria, not the sole coordinator.",

        "content": "In the wake of a documentary featuring sexual abuse claims, the singer\u2019s California property is back on the market at a reduced price\nMichael Jackson\u2019s Neverland ranch has returned to the housing market at a drastically reduced rate as allegations of sexual abuse have been brought to light.\nThe singer\u2019s 2,700-acre California property, now rebranded as the Sycamore Valley Ranch, has been listed for $31m, a major drop from the original asking price of $100m when it was first put on the market in 2015. Included in the estate is a tennis court, a swimming pool and a movie theatre.\nReal estate agent Kyle Forsyth told CBS News that the decision to relist with a reduced price was because \u201cthe timing is right for new stewardship\u201d. The price drop is allegedly the result of years of drought and natural disasters but the property is well-maintained. Jackson originally brought it for $19.5m in 1987.\nThe news comes just days before HBO airs Leaving Neverland, a two-part four-hour documentary that features the testimonies of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who allege that the singer sexually abused them as children. In the film they claim that Jackson would habitually molest them in various parts of the property. \u201cIt sounds sick but it\u2019s kind of like when you\u2019re first dating somebody,\u201d Safechuck explained, after listing the many spaces at the complex where Jackson would allegedly abuse him.\nJackson\u2019s estate is suing HBO, calling the documentary a \u201cone-sided marathon of unvetted propaganda to shamelessly exploit an innocent man no longer here to defend himself\u201d. The suit claims that the network is in breach of a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract.\nThe singer\u2019s family have also been speaking out against the film, with three of his brothers and a nephew appearing on CBS this week to criticise its content, despite none of them having seen it. They believe that the reason behind the two men coming forward is purely financial. \u201cIt\u2019s all about money,\u201d his brother Marlon said. Taj referred to his uncle as \u201ca blank cheque\u201d.",

Lawyers for the families said they disagreed with that assessment.\nThe inquest heard that warnings were phoned in at 8.11pm on the night of 21 November. Within 20 minutes both bombs had detonated but it was not until 9.10pm that extra officers started arriving at the scenes. This was after the Aer Lingus flight carrying McDade\u2019s body left at 8.30pm.\nThe inquest heard that the IRA had carried out a \u201cserious and sustained\u201d campaign of attacks in the West Midlands in the 12 months leading up to the pub bombings, which focused on unguarded soft targets. There were 53 bombing incidents in the year to 21 November.\nLeslie Thomas QC, representing nine of the families, said: \u201cThe threat was high. The threat was serious. The threats were obvious.\u201d He said the night of the pub bombings was both a late shopping night and payday.\nThe coroner, Sir Peter Thornton, read the jury a transcript of a police interview with Raymond McLaughlin, 21, who assisted McDade and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many IRA bombers giving an account of themselves,\u201d said Thornton. \u201cSo this is a rarity.\u201d\nMcLaughlin is recorded as telling the interviewing officer: \u201cYou and the imperialist Americans have got to learn to keep your hands off other people\u2019s countries. They are in south Vietnam and you\u2019re in Ireland. You must want to hang on for some reason.\u201d\nHe was asked: \u201cDo you agree that if you plant a bomb in a city there\u2019s a fair chance of someone getting killed?\u201d He responded: \u201cYes, but you can\u2019t bother with that.\u201d\nThe inquest into the Birmingham pub bombing deaths was initially opened in November 1974, but was adjourned to allow for a criminal investigation. In 1975, six men \u2013 who became known as the Birmingham Six \u2013 were convicted for the bombings, but were acquitted 16 years later.\nFresh inquests into the deaths were ordered in 2016, but were delayed by disputes about whether the hearings should examine who might be responsible for the bombings.\nThe inquest is expected to last up to six weeks. The jury was taken to see the sites of the two pubs, the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town, on Thursday morning.\nThey were later shown short film clips and photographs of the devastation caused by the bombing. An image was shown of the number 90 bus, which was passing the Mulberry Bush at the time of the blast, with its windows blown out.\nGiving evidence, David Grafton, who was twenty in 1974, said he arrived at the Tavern in the Town a few minutes after 8pm on the night of the attack. He said he spoke briefly to Maxine Hambleton, who was killed in the bombing, before going to the bar to get a drink.\n\u201cI picked the glass up and then there was a flashing light and a boom and next thing I know I\u2019m lying on the floor, not knowing where I was. Total blackness, quiet, not a sound. Then screaming and pandemonium,\u201d he said. He said he was incredibly lucky to escape with just two perforated ear drums.",

It added that many more complaints of child sexual abuse in custody had been made than revealed in official figures, including those published by HMs Inspectorate of Prisons.\nIt said there were 1,070 incidents of alleged sexual abuse in YOIs and STCs reported from 2009 to 2017.\n\u201cThis number is shockingly high, given that there has been a significant drop in numbers of detained children over that time,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe current population is around 900.\u201d\nOnly nine alleged incidents resulted in criminal charges, of which four resulted in convictions.\nThe inquiry found that the institutions had been \u201cvery poorly resourced\u201d and that staff turnover was running at unacceptably high levels in YOIs and in STCs, \u201cwith low morale and inadequate training, including safeguarding training\u201d.\n\u201cThere has been a shocking decline in safety in the secure estate in recent years,\u201d it said. \u201cThis has been caused by management instability and staffing losses. There is some evidence that these have been linked to budget cuts \u2026 There is little doubt that YOIs and STCs were in crisis by the end of the inquiry\u2019s investigation period.\u201d\nEvidence from adults who were sexually abused while in custodial institutions as children has been also included in the report.\n\u201cThe harrowing accounts of non-recent child sexual abuse within custodial institutions were some of the worst cases this inquiry has heard,\u201d said Jay.\nOne witness said that when he was 11 he was sexually assaulted by two members of staff at the same time and another witness said he was raped and sexually assaulted 35 times by four members of staff and a former pupil at Stanhope Castle, an approved school. On several occasions he was choked unconscious.\n\u201cBut I am also deeply disturbed by the continuing problem of child sexual abuse in these institutions over the last decade,\u201d Jay said. \u201cIt is clear these children, who are some of the most vulnerable in society, are still at risk of sexual abuse. I hope our report and recommendations can help protect them better in future.\u201d\nThe number of children in custody has declined since mid-2008, from more than 3,000 to about 900 at any one time.\nThe report looked at the alleged sexual abuse and exploitation of children held in secure units since 2009, including at Feltham and Werrington YOIs, Medway and Rainsbrook STCs and Vinney Green and Aycliffe secure children\u2019s homes.\nThe inquiry is now calling on the Department for Education and the Youth Custody Service to launch a full review of whether placing children in secure homes increases the risk of sexual abuse. It also wants the Ministry of Justice to ban the use of \u201cpain compliance techniques\u201d, which includes methods such as bending of a child\u2019s thumbs and wrists. It said this amounted to child abuse but its use had been recorded 119 recorded times from March 2016 to March 2017 alone.\nThe justice minister Edward Argar said details in the report were \u201cshocking\u201d and pledged to urgently consider the findings. \u201cWe have recognised the need for fundamental reform of youth custody to ensure that the safety, welfare and rehabilitation of young people are prioritised across all aspects of the system,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs part of this we are already conducting an urgent review into safeguarding in the youth estate, are rolling out new specialist training for staff and have commissioned an independent review of pain inducing restraint techniques. In addition, we increased frontline Youth Custody Service staff by over a third in 2018 and are completely changing our approach by investing in Secure Schools that will put education at heart of youth custody.\nMinisters have commissioned Charlie Taylor, chairman of the youth justice board for England and Wales, to undertake an independent review of pain-inducing restraint techniques to conclude this summer.\nConcerns about abuse in the institutions has been growing for several years. In February 2016, the Guardian revealed that serious allegations of abuse and bullying by staff at Medway had been reported by a whistleblower, Nathan Ward, more than a decade before.\nG4S, which ran Medway, was stripped of the contract. In 2014, G4S, Serco and the Youth Justice Board paid out a combined figure of almost \u00a3100,000 in damages to 14 children who had been abused at STCs between 2004 and 2008 and other similar civil actions are pending.\nIn January this year, a report into the alleged abuse of children at Medway found that a series of failings led to \u201cerratic and ineffective\u201d monitoring of investigations into the claims.\nA serious case review criticised a contract between the Youth Justice Board and Barnado\u2019s, saying the contract \u201cexpressly did not allow\u201d the charity, which was acting as an independent advocate for children at Medway, to refer concerns about child protection to the local authority responsible for their welfare.",

Karen studied anthroposophy \u2013 the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner \u2013 and, with support from Barnardo\u2019s, took the dance and somatic wellbeing master\u2019s course at the University of Central Lancashire, so that she could develop somatic work \u2013 harnessing the therapeutic powers of the body \u2013 with children affected by trauma or sexual abuse. She later became part of the Knowing Body Network, a collective of dance artists working in health and community settings.\nKaren was warm, funny, outspoken and passionate. When told that she wanted to do somatic movement work with children, some of her colleagues in Barnardo\u2019s thought it sounded a bit bonkers. But Karen was brave and ahead of her time in her thinking, and what she proposed many years ago is now recognised as an important element of work with children who have experienced trauma.\nAt Barnardo\u2019s, Karen challenged traditional thinking. In 1992, she met Diana, Princess of Wales, while developing an HIV/Aids planning service, and her later work as a therapeutic project worker delivering services to vulnerable children and families was recognised in 2010 with an award presented by the Duchess of Cornwall, president of Barnardo\u2019s.\nKaren was born in Altrincham, the daughter of George Adcock, a butcher, and Marjorie Fendall (nee Eckersley), a financial adviser. After leaving Kingsway girls\u2019 school in Cheadle, Karen trained to be a state registered nurse in learning disability, then became a community nurse in Manchester and in Bolton. She took a round-the-world trip with a friend and worked for a children\u2019s charity in London, before returning to Manchester. After a spell as a community nurse in Runcorn, she joined Barnardo\u2019s.\nKaren and I married in 1993, and in 2009 we moved to York so that our son, Finlay, could attend a Steiner project there. Karen left Barnardo\u2019s in 2010, then after two years started working at Haxby Road primary academy in York, and later with the wider Ebor Academy Trust as safeguarding and wellbeing team leader. Her work was recognised with an award from the local Groves Association for services to the Haxby Road school community.\nShe used movement to open up a child\u2019s sensory and imaginative landscape, and often spoke eloquently about the effects of this experiential learning in helping children to become active and positive members of the school community.\nIn 2017, Karen and Jasmine Pasch co-wrote a chapter for Miranda Tufnell\u2019s When I Open My Eyes. Karen\u2019s final research explored the effects of somatic work with children at risk of exclusion from school. Through play and movement exploration, Karen\u2019s work supported children to cope better with their home and school environment.\nKaren was vibrant and full of life. Some people have a way about them, a special gift for connecting and understanding. Karen was one of the very best.\nKaren is survived by me and Finlay, and by her mother, Marjorie, and brother, Steven.",

Current flight paths to Heathrow are not routed directly over the park.\nThe Heathrow Airspace and Future Operations consultation, which follows MPs\u2019 approval of the third runway last year, indicates that 47 arrivals an hour and between 17 and 47 departures would fly directly over the park at below 900 metres. Heathrow\u2019s flights are currently capped at 480,000 a year, but it wants to increase this by 25,000 in 2021 and further when the third runway is built.\nEnvironmental campaigners say the noise and pollution will be disastrous for the sensitive wildlife and the tranquillity of an area visited by more than 5.5 million people a year. Thousands of nocturnal animals \u2013 including 11 of the UK\u2019s 17 bat species, all of which are protected by law, and little and tawny owls \u2013 the park will be threatened, they say.\nThe park, which stretches over 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), is a site of special scientific interest, a national nature reserve and a European conservation area. Sir David Attenborough said in a recent documentary that the largest royal park in the capital was home to thousands of wildlife species supported by the sensitive and legally protected acid grasslands.\nThe changes to flight paths will start in 2021, because Heathrow plans to increase flights by 25,000 a year ibefore the proposed third runway is built, and will be adopted in full on completion of the third runway in 2026.\nHeathrow, which is owned by Heathrow Airports Holdings Ltd, has placed noise monitors across the park in preparation for the proposed flights.\nRon Compton, the chairman of Friends of Richmond Park, said: \u201cIt is disastrous. It is shocking to see the potential impact the proposed flight paths could have on Richmond Park and its wonderful wildlife and environment so treasured by millions.\n\u201cThe park is the darkest and the quietest place in London and this will be shattered by these new flight paths. Increasingly, medical experts and even government bodies recognise the important value of green, quiet open spaces to the nation\u2019s physical and mental health. We call on all the millions of visitors who treasure the park to protest against these proposals.\u201d\nThe royal park was established by Kings Charles I as a hunting ground in the 17th century. Attenborough said in his documentary that steps had to be taken to protect the park from the impact of increased human activity.\nThe expansion of Heathrow airport from two to three runways will be challenged next month in a judicial review that will involve five separate legal challenges.\nFive councils \u2013 Hillingdon, Hammersmith and Fulham, Richmond, Wandsworth and Windsor and Maidenhead \u2013 Greenpeace and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, are involved in the legal fight to stop the third runway being built.\nA spokesperson for Khan said: \u201cSadiq has serious concerns about the impact of a third runway on air quality, noise pollution and public transport.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the mayor has joined councils and Greenpeace in taking legal action against the additional runway at Heathrow. He is hoping the government sees sense and doesn\u2019t proceed with the plans that will be damaging for our city and for the wellbeing of Londoners.\u201d\nFriends of the Earth revealed this week that almost 2,000 locations in England and Wales had illegal air pollution levels from transport emissions, most of them in London.\nPaul McGuinness, the chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said the expansion would mean poorer air quality and increased noise.\n\u201cOperations at Heathrow, which is already \u2013 statistically \u2013 the world\u2019s most highly disruptive airport, have been keeping its residents up at night for years. And it\u2019s now proposed that their treasured spots of tranquillity should be overflown, at low altitudes as well.\n\u201cThe price that Heathrow is demanding of residents, so that it can increase its operations by over a whole half again, is simply disproportionate and unacceptable.\u201d\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cOur consultation is an opportunity for local communities to share their views on our proposals and the potential impact. Feedback from this consultation, together with our design principles and technical requirements, will be used to develop our flight path options. These will be the proposed routes that aircraft will fly and we plan to hold a further consultation on our preferred options.\u201d\nThe consultation closes for feedback at midnight on 4 March.",

Does it ensure that we will be able to finish all the work? But if this is the way out to prevent a hard Brexit then we will support this path.\u201d\nMay is understood to have beentold during recent discussions with Tusk and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, that the Commons vote on 12 March, should provide a clear path as to how the deal could be saved even if the meaningful note is lost.\n\u201cA short extension without a mandate, or something from Westminster, will be very difficult,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cIf Westminster is not able to say anything, I don\u2019t think the European council will buy it. What the European council will try to avoid is a discussion at the European council.\n\u201cShe has to pose the right question to get the right answer. There are two schools of thought, one is that a short extension will be a short jump that will precede another extension, and this is something people hate, politically and even from a purely administrative point of view. So others say it is better to have a long extension.\u201d\nSome senior EU officials and diplomats are pushing the idea of a 21-month extension, which would delay Brexit until 2021, to allow plans for the future relationship to develop, and for there even to be a change of personnel in Downing Street.\nThere is, however, also resistance among member states who fear the EU will be blamed for trapping the UK in the bloc. \u201cIt is like playing the kingmaker, it isn\u2019t sensible to intervene in domestic politics like that,\u201d said one sceptic of the idea.\nA delegation of Dutch MPs, which recently visited Westminster to examine the most probable outcome of the Brexit impasse, reported to their parliament that a no-deal scenario appeared likely. They said British MPs were \u201cunable to reach agreement let alone make a proposal\u201d to unlock the talks.",

        "content": "The lurid accusations and arbitrary punishments meted out in centuries long gone are all too reminiscent of the way young women are harassed and blamed today\nIf you were tried for witchcraft in early modern Scotland, one of the surest ways to be convicted was to confess. Of course, you didn\u2019t need to confess to be convicted, and confession wasn\u2019t always voluntary. This problem led to a practice called \u201cwaking the witch\u201d: a form of torture that involved depriving the accused of sleep for days on end, until they were so exhausted they would hallucinate and babble incoherently. These \u201cravings\u201d would often later be used as evidence of guilt.\nIt sounds barbaric and antiquated: accusing a woman of being strange and unnatural, driving her mad with constant prodding, depriving her of sleep. But it also sounds chillingly familiar. I was reminded of a teenage girl I had recently met who, after an incident involving a boy at her school had gone viral on social media, began being bombarded with abuse by her peers. They called her a slut and a slag on multiple internet platforms. They shared embarrassing photographs of her, while forever escalating rumours started to spread. But unlike my own adolescence, when some escape from school could always be found at home, this young woman\u2019s life had become a prison of endless abuse. The alerts and notifications pinged directly to her phone, vibrating through the night, causing her to become more and more panicked as sleep deprivation set in. Having initially rejected the labels others were assigning to her, she started to fear that they were right. It\u2019s hard to hold on to who you are when dozens of people are telling you that you\u2019re worthless. Does this sound like an exaggeration? For thousands of teenage girls across the UK, it isn\u2019t.\nWhen I first started researching the witch trials that swept through Scotland between the 16th and 18th centuries, I was shocked by the cruelty and misogyny of many of the practices that flourished during that time. Duplicitous professional \u201cwitch prickers\u201d roamed the country, using trick needles to test suspects\u2019 bodies for \u201cwitches\u2019 marks\u201d, which they claimed would prove their guilt. Sexism was rife, with the majority of those tried for witchcraft being women. Deep anxieties about gender and sexuality crept into the trials; one woman was accused of being able to transfer labour pains on to a pregnant woman\u2019s husband, while others were accused of fornicating with the devil. Ad hoc local courts flourished, where prominent men essentially became both judge and jury; execution rates soared to around 90%. Between the passage of the Witchcraft Act in 1593 and its repeal in 1736, Scotland saw around 5,000 witchcraft prosecutions \u2013 three times higher than England, despite having just a quarter of the population. It is estimated that more than 1,500 people were executed in Scotland alone.\nAs I dug deeper, uncovering the details of individual trials, I was struck by the similarities between the women then and the virtual witch hunts young women are going through today. \u201cDunking\u201d, where a woman was submerged in water as either punishment for being a \u201cscold\u201d or to ascertain her guilt in a case of witchcraft, reminded me of the girls I meet now who find themselves trapped between two bad outcomes. Like being put under enormous pressure to share nude photographs, then rejected for being frigid if they refuse or castigated as sluts when they relent.\nMany trials \u2013 like the memorable case of the woman accused of cursing a man by giving him a permanent erection \u2013 suggested that women\u2019s feminine wiles gave them unfair control over men, whose own sexual behaviour was framed as involuntary. I read the stories on train journeys, on my way to school visits where I would meet girls who had been punished for school dress-code violations, who were told that the sight of their shoulders, knees or bra straps was unfair to male teachers or risked distracting the boys. I heard from girls who had been sexually harassed or even assaulted by boys at school, groped and upskirted as they climbed stairs between lessons. In some cases, their predominantly male supervisors\u2019 only answer was \u201cboys will be boys\u201d, with any blame placed on their own dress or behaviour. (\u201cHe probably just likes you: did you do something to lead him on?\u201d) Girls whose images were shared online without their consent were frequently given punishments equal to or greater than those who had done the sharing. Many were forced out of school altogether, some because of sexual bullying and others after enduring draconian punishments for the crime of being a victim.\nThe parallels kept mounting. Women accused of being somehow inherently dangerous and powerful. Their bodies blamed for causing innocent men to behave in ways they could not control. Punished and shamed for their sexuality, their guilt determined and punishment executed by groups of powerful men.\nAnd even today, young women who dare to call themselves feminists risk attracting the same label: witch.\nAs I spoke out about what I had seen and heard on my school visits, people often responded by bemoaning the perils of social media and the problems they had created for young women. As if these were new and startling issues that had arisen purely because of technology.\nOne day, I stumbled across the story of a young woman named Maggie, who lived in a tiny fishing village in Fife in the mid-17th century. Her treatment by her local community 400 years ago seemed near-identical to the experiences of the girls I work with today. As I read about unmarried, pregnant Maggie who was confined to the \u201ccutty-stool\u201d, a three-legged chair raised above the church congregation on Sunday, so she could be humiliated by the minister in front of her neighbours, I knew I had to tell these stories side by side. Derided as a \u201charlot\u201d and a \u201climmer\u201d despite being the victim of abuse, Maggie was accused of witchcraft after the man who had harassed, impregnated and then abandoned her was lost in a fishing accident.\nI wanted to give a voice to the girls whose stories still aren\u2019t being heard, whose accusations are so often disbelieved and whose bodies are blamed for their own injuries. I wanted to remember the women whose voices have been lost to history, never allowed to speak out or record their own version of events. And most of all, I wanted the opportunity to say: Look! This isn\u2019t a new story. It\u2019s not a modern invention or a problem created by the internet. It won\u2019t go away on its own, unless we do something to change it. These stories span four centuries. These stories are the same.\n The Burning by Laura Bates is out now (\u00a36.99, Simon & Schuster). To order a copy, go to guardianbookshop.com.

The UK says it has rights through continuous use of the land.\nThe EU\u2019s no-deal legislation notes that the regulation is \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d to the \u201cposition of the Kingdom of Spain with regard to the sovereignty over the territory in which the airport of Gibraltar is situated\u201d, and fails to mention the UK\u2019s rival claim.\nThe UK\u2019s deputy ambassador to the EU, Katrina Williams,, has made a formal statement rejecting the language used in the EU\u2019s legislation, complaining that both the Spanish and British claims over the territory should have been cited as both states are currently EU members.\nThe UK\u2019s statement \u201creiterates certainty over its sovereignty over Gibraltar, including the territory in which Gibraltar airport is situated\u201d, and says the UK government is \u201cadamant that, as this measure will be adopted while the UK is still a member state, the legal position of the UK should be reflected\u201d.\nThe British government also made clear \u201cits regret that Gibraltar has not been included in the scope of this measure and reiterates its intention that, when it comes to the future relationship with the EU, it will negotiate on behalf of the entire UK family, including its overseas territories\u201d.\nEU sources said the UK needed to realise that the decision to leave would have repercussions. They pointed out that the UK made Spain \u201cswallow\u201d the British position on Gibraltar when the country sought to join the then European economic community in 1984, even threatening to veto it if Madrid failed to reopen the land border.\nA British government spokesman said the practical impact was limited, because there were no flights between Gibraltar and EU destinations other than the UK.\nThe spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome the substance of this proposal, which will ensure that flights between the UK and EU continue in a no-deal scenario, helping minimise disruption to citizens and businesses. The UK will reciprocate and provide, as a minimum, equivalent rights to airlines from those European states.\n\u201cHowever, we disagree with the language inserted by Spain in relation to sovereignty over the land on which the airport is built as it does not recognise the UK\u2019s position on sovereignty.\n\u201cWe are certain of our sovereignty over the whole of Gibraltar. We are also disappointed that the text that will go forward for adoption does not cover Gibraltar.\u201d\nThe issue of Gibraltar also continues to hold up visa-free travel for British nationals in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

        "content": "Newport Street Gallery, LondonHirst has dipped into his own collection to deliver a heartfelt elegy to the frenzied, forgotten paintings of John Bellany and Alan Davie\nDamien Hirst is like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. Just as the creature postulated by physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger is both dead and alive in a box until it\u2019s opened, so the artist in Hirst is either genuinely brilliant or absolutely terrible. Predicting if you\u2019ll get the freaky genius or his arrogant twin is an impossible exercise in quantum criticism.\nWhich brings us to his hobby of collecting and curating other people\u2019s art. At his Newport Street Gallery, Hirst puts on exhibitions from his own hoard that veer from pop kitsch to porn paintings. Yet in his latest throw of the dice, he reveals his most courageous and sensitive side. What public gallery would dedicate such a generous, heartfelt exhibition to two British artists who were far from fashionable in their lifetimes and might easily sink into oblivion now they are dead?\nJohn Bellany died in 2013, his friend Alan Davie a year later. Bellany\u2019s self-portrait in hospital and portrait of the elderly Davie are displayed, emotionally, at the start of the exhibition. They made their names as painters in the 1950s and 60s and, by the time of their deaths, were seen as part of the staid and sterile RA establishment of British art that had been thrown in to the dustbin of history by none other than Hirst and the punk-conceptual art revolution he led. Yet here is Hirst giving them a lavish elegy.\nThe paint hits you like a shrieking sax solo in the first of Newport\u2019s perfectly lit meditative spaces. Davie played jazz after he was demobbed following the second world war. His paintings are primal improvisations of percussive marks and slobbering riffs. His 1951 canvas Untitled Female takes us into a bedsit studio in austerity Britain where sex explodes rebelliously out of the chilly air: breasts drawn in black paint, Picasso-style, boom out of a chaos of pinks, yellows, reds. There is a graffito of the painter\u2019s cock and balls in there, too.\nDavie\u2019s paintings in this show date from the 1940s to 60s \u2013 and they are mighty. He was one of Britain\u2019s few really convincing abstract painters. Free from any hint of gentility or St Ives-ishness, his abstractions have cojones \u2013 lots of them, crudely sketched into fierce, frenzied surfaces.\nWhile Davie is manifestly in thrall to the shamanism of Jackson Pollock, emulating not only his drips but his early obsession with Jungian mythological imagery, he also has a lot in common with Cy Twombly and Jean Dubuffet, in the way he mixes modernism and street art. In his ritualistic 1958 painting Insignia of the Gannet People, a hammer shape is delineated in white under a storm of markings while lines radiate out in a cartoon image of magic power. It looks, for all the world, like it belongs in a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat.\nBellany\u2019s paintings are interpersed with Davie\u2019s, and they suffer for it. The best are the earliest. Bellany\u2019s 1963 work The Crucifixion is a morbid array of pieces of dead fish, tacked up and displayed on a table in a grotesque parody of religious art. Unfortunately, in later works such as 1972\u2019s Celtic Voyage, with its gathering of mythological characters I can\u2019t quite care about, he strays from visceral truth into tepid painterly fringe theatre.\nStill, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being made to look at an artist you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily bother with. For this exhibition has an enthusiastic interest in the byways of art history. There\u2019s a lot more to British art, Hirst effectively says, than pickled cows. There have been some riotous painters \u2013 and not just the handful you\u2019ve heard of. British history looks different through less familiar eyes. Cliche has it that the 1960s were liberated. That\u2019s not how Bellany sees Scotland in his furious 1969 triptych Homage to John Knox, with its Goya-esque panorama of bigots and witches, or his equally enraged portrayal of disapproving puritans entitled God Is Love (1968).\nIt\u2019s as if Hirst wants to take apart the shallow instant histories in which British art changed for ever when a young artist called Damien Hirst curated Frieze in a Docklands warehouse in London in 1988. Supposedly, he and his generation blew away the painterly cobwebs of postwar British art with readymades. It\u2019s not like that, says this engrossing celebration of paint. What\u2019s the difference between a painting of dead fish and a display of actual dead fish? Bellany, Davie and Hirst at their best were all young artists trying to say something about life and death, making strange art in a strange little country \u2013 sometimes getting lost, but sometimes hitting the gory vein of life.\n John Bellany and Alan Davie: Cradle of Magic is at Newport Street Gallery, London, until 2 June.",

        "content": "Organisation to give support to and encourage greater representation of people of colour in UK game development \nA group of games industry insiders has launched a new initiative to tackle the problem of poor diversity in the UK video game development sector.\nPOC in Play is described by the group as a racial equity and inclusion movement with an aim to improve representation and to provide events and initiatives for people of colour either working in the industry or thinking of joining.\n\u201cThe only statistics we do have are really old \u2013 that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Chella Ramanan, a journalist and games writer, who along with developer Adam Campbell is a founder of POC in Play. \u201cThe newest figure is from a 2015 Creative Skillset report and it shows that just 4% of the UK games industry is from ethnic minority groups. If you compare that with film and TV in the UK, it\u2019s 30% in London and 15% nationally. There\u2019s a big disparity between games and other creative sectors.\u201d\nOther founding members of POC in Play include Moo Yu, co-founder of developer Foam Sword Games, and award-winning technical artist Jodie Azhar, CEO of Teazelcat Games.\nRamanan sees the problem of representation in games as self-perpetuating: children of colour don\u2019t see different ethnic groups working in the industry, so may not think of it as a viable career. The lack of diversity is also reflected in the games the industry produces. The situation has improved recently, with leading roles for people of colour in blockbuster games such as Far Cry New Dawn and Apex Legends. Ramanan sees the fact that it is difficult to agree on good examples of representation as part of the problem in an industry where representations of white male heroes are so widespread.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a problem of visibility, both of people working in the industry and in the games themselves,\u201d said Ramanan. \u201cThe representation is often stereotypical \u2013 a black man will often be, say, an LA gang member, but that\u2019s not representing the experience of people in Leeds or Birmingham, or the Caribbean. South Asian people are rarely represented at all. There\u2019s a lack of seeing your own stories being portrayed so young people of colour aren\u2019t being encouraged to think: \u2018I could make a game like that.\u2019\u201d\nThe organisation, which is being supported by London-based developer UsTwo Games, responsible for the best-selling Monument Valley, is planning to hold a regular series of meetings in which people of colour can network and discuss their experiences. The first of these will take place on 22 March.\nWe're thrilled to launch POC in Play - a racial equity & inclusion movement aiming to address the lack of representation & inclusion of People of Colour in the UK videogames industry, with partnership from @ustwogamesIf you're a POC in games celebrate with us with #IamPOCinPlay pic.twitter.com/5zjC4Q1IGS\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want these to be just social, it\u2019s not just about getting all the black and Asian game developers together,\u201d said Ramanan. \u201cWe want to invite speakers from outside the games industry. It\u2019s really important to reach out to other sectors: if TV and film are ahead of us, we need to be finding out how they got there. We need people in education and other successful diversity organisations.\u201d Other planned initiatives include the formation of a stock photo library, for press and publicity sources, featuring images of people of colour playing video games and working in game development.\nFor people of colour working inside the industry, POC in Play is aiming to become a space where concerns and experiences can be aired and discussed \u2013 a situation that can be difficult if you\u2019re the only non-white person in a studio. \u201cWe want to give people a support network,\u201d said Ramanan. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be able to talk to each other and to know that other people are out there. If you\u2019re having trouble with something on your team, you can come to a meeting and ask: \u2018Is this me being over-sensitive or is this a problem?\u2019 Those day-to-day micro aggressions. If you\u2019re alone you tend to gaslight yourself: \u2018Did that really happen? Should I be bothered?\u2019 When you\u2019re the one person of colour in the room, that is a factor.\u201d\nPart of the remit of POC in Play will also be lobbying the industry to improve workforce and onscreen representation, but aiding in that process.\n\u201cA lot of publishers do want a more diverse workforce, but they may have blind spots: we can help with that,\u201d said Ramanan. \u201cWe do want things to change. If a developer wants to be considerate with portrayal then we should be able to help \u2013 even if that\u2019s to suggest someone they need to pay to be a consultant. People of colour shouldn\u2019t be doing this labour for free.\u201d",

        "content": "Claudio Ranieri has been sacked by Fulham after the club\u2019s directors and supporters lost confidence in him. The final straw for the manager came in the relegation battle at Southampton on Wednesday, when the team lost 2-0 and the travelling fans chanted \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d at him. It was a seventh defeat in eight Premier League games. Scott Parker, the first-team coach, has been placed in caretaker charge.\nThe vice-chairman, Tony Khan, was at St Mary\u2019s for a result that took Ranieri\u2019s league record with the club to P16 W3 D3 L10 since he replaced Slavisa Jokanovic in mid-November. Fulham are 10 points off safety with 10 matches to play.\nShahid Khan, the club\u2019s chairman and Tony\u2019s father, is in the US but he took the lead in the discussions over Ranieri\u2019s future on Thursday, which also involved the chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, and the non-executive director Mark Lamping.\nThe key decision-makers concluded that Ranieri had been damned by the evidence on the pitch and in the stands, and Shahid Khan released a statement shortly before 5pm to confirm the Italian\u2019s departure, along with the temporary appointment of Parker.\n\u201cClaudio Ranieri agreed to my decision that a change was in the best interest of everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cNo surprise to me, Claudio was a perfect gentleman, as always. Be assured he is not solely to blame for the position we are in today.\n\u201cClaudio walked into a difficult situation, inheriting a side that gained only one point in its prior eight matches, and he provided an immediate boost by leading our club to nine points in his first eight matches. Though we were unable to maintain that pace thereafter, I am grateful for his effort.\u201d\nBad start\nHaving spent over \u00a3100m on new players, Fulham begin the season with\u00a0a 2-0 home defeat\u00a0to Crystal Palace\u00a0\nBournemouth boos\nJeers greet the final whistle as Fulham suffer a fourth heavy defeat in succession, against Bournemouth\u00a0at Craven Cottage\nJokanovic feels the heat\n\u2018I am a fantastic coach\u2019 says Slavisa Jokanovic as he comes out fighting for his job following a 1-0 loss\u00a0away to Huddersfield\nJokanovic is no more\nJokanovic is sacked soon after a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool. Claudio Ranieri is immediately confirmed as the Serb\u2019s successor\nNew manager bounce\nRanieri gets off to the perfect start: a 3-2 home victory against fellow relegation candidates Southampton\nKamara conflict\nRanieri rages at Aboubakar Kamara after he snatches \u2013 and misses \u2013 a penalty from Aleksandar Mitrovic at home to Huddersfield\nKamara kicked out\nKamara is banned by Fulham and eventually leaves the club in a loan deal following an incident at the training ground\nEmbarrassing exit\nFulham suffer the embarrassment of a home loss to League Two Oldham Athletic in the third-round of the FA Cup\nClaudio is cut loose\nThe losses keep on coming for Fulham and after\u00a0a seventh in eight league games \u2013 at Southampton \u2013 Ranieri is sacked\u00a0\nRanieri said: \u201cI am obviously disappointed with the recent results and that we could not build on the good start we made following my appointment. I would like to thank the club, the players and the fans for the support they have given me.\u201d\nShahid Khan sounded resigned to an immediate return to the Championship \u2013 Fulham were promoted via the play-offs \u2013 and it has certainly been a disastrous season on many levels.\nThe club spent \u00a3110.5m last summer on signings needed to bolster a squad who had been depleted by the loss of many loanees. The conditions were difficult because of the late finish to last season owing to the play-off final and the earlier-than-usual closure of the window on 9 August, plus the fact the World Cup took place.\nThat said, the majority of the new players have struggled, some because of injury, such as Alfie Mawson, and others because they have failed to find their feet. The most glaring example of that has been Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa, who joined for \u00a330m from Marseille. Only Aleksandar Mitrovic, Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri and possibly Calum Chambers, who is on loan from Arsenal, have shown anything like the required levels.\nRanieri saw his team exit the FA Cup at home to League Two Oldham and his reluctance to trust the 18-year-old wide player Ryan Sessegnon was deeply unpopular with supporters.\nThere was also the damaging Aboubakar Kamara saga, which came in three parts. First, the striker grabbed a penalty from Mitrovic against Huddersfield, which he missed; second, he fought with him during a squad yoga session; and then, having been banished to train with the under-23s, he was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm when he visited the training ground seeking to discuss his future with Mackintosh.\nWhat has most upset Fulham fans this season has been the loss of their reputation for entertaining football, which they earned last season. They have routinely been awful to watch.\nShahid Khan said: \u201cScott Parker\u2019s immediate assignment is merely to help us stabilise, grow and rediscover ourselves as a football club. If Scott can answer that challenge and our players respond to the opportunity, perhaps victories will follow in the months ahead.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important, however, is to regroup in a smart and deliberate manner that will serve our long-term vision for sustainable success. If we\u2019re able to do that and win some matches to make a stand late in the season, all the better.\u201d",

        "content": "England\u2019s one-day renaissance began in 2015 with a Jos Buttler-inspired monster of 408 for nine against New Zealand at Edgbaston and, having never climbed so high previously, their batsmen have since gone on to pass the hallowed 400-barrier on three more occasions.\nBut only in their most recent such feat \u2013 the near-gazumping in Grenada on Wednesday \u2013 did they walk off the field at the end looking closer to survivors in a disaster film than victors. Until Adil Rashid finally doused the West Indian fire in the 48th over of the chase, claiming four wickets in five balls, English hearts had been in their mouths.\nThey will have learned plenty from the tense 29-run win that followed their 418 for six batting first, both on the field and at the team hotel that evening. Eoin Morgan is said to have drilled home to the players just how good they have now become, how they can outgun any rival batting lineup and how much belief they should take from the win.\nCertainly with the bat they continue to set the standard. Buttler\u2019s 76-ball 150 \u2013 the second fastest in ODI cricket after AB de Villiers \u2013 and a century for Morgan himself made it the ninth time in four years that two England batsmen have got to three-figures in the same innings; this is one more than during the 638 one-day games they played up to the 2015 World Cup.\nWhen Buttler made England\u2019s fastest ODI century in 2014 \u2013 46 balls against Pakistan in 2015 \u2013 it pushed Kevin Pietersen\u2019s 69-ball effort against South Africa in 2005 into second place. This has now dropped down to ninth in the country\u2019s all-time list, further highlighting the incredible strides taken.\nThe evening debrief in the team room, one of relief, astonishment, shock and delight when recounting a day of 807 runs, 16 wickets and 46 sixes, may also have doubled as group therapy for members of the bowling attack.\nPast winning margins of 210 runs, 169 and 242 when sticking 400-plus on the board against New Zealand, Pakistan and Australia respectively (the last two via world record totals) were stress-free processions, where the volume of runs and early wickets soon turned the chase into an exercise in futility.\nNot this time. England struck early but still went through an emotional mangle, the usually ice-cool Morgan admitting he had never previously been so pushed to the limit. West Indies, inspired by Chris Gayle\u2019s latest exhibition of power-hitting (162 from 97 balls) and the determination of Carlos Brathwaite (50 from 36) to remain a name to remember, were ahead for much of the chase.\nIt should come as no surprise that pace and leg-spin \u2013 two game-changing elements missing from England\u2019s doomed World Cup campaign four years ago \u2013 helped them prevail. Mark Wood\u2019s two-wicket over came when the hosts had scorched to 220 for 2 after 23 overs and required 199 more from 27; Rashid shut down a situation that began with West Indies, four wickets in hand and two set men, needing 32 off the last three.\nRashid, it is possible to argue, has now risen to become one of England\u2019s most irreplaceable players leading into this year\u2019s World Cup. A fine 82 from Alex Hales, deputising for the hamstrung Jason Roy, shows they can cope with injury to a batsman, but to lose a wicket-taker such as Rashid, whose value in the later overs is growing, would change everything.\nBen Stokes is probably the other in this bracket for the balance he brings, and had Wednesday\u2019s carnage unfolded two days earlier, when rain held sway but he was out with an ankle niggle, goodness knows how Morgan would have coped with just five bowlers. Stokes may have been taken to the cleaners by Gayle in his first spell, but to return and take the opener\u2019s wicket with the first ball of his second was critical to England going 2-1 up in the series with one to play.\nLiam Plunkett will take heart from being the tightest bowler on the day (five an over) while the temperamentally solid Chris Woakes should hopefully shrug off figures of none for 91 as just one of those days. Moeen Ali, meanwhile, faced a unique challenge from the tradewinds and short boundaries, alongside a freakishly dangerous batsman in Gayle.\nWas it the day England proved, as Morgan later told his troops, they have more runs in their lineup than the opposition on most occasions? Or did it serve as a reminder that the bowling attack remains slightly vulnerable on the types of surfaces their batsmen so clearly love?\nTime will tell. And perhaps we will only know England\u2019s true feelings on the matter when the World Cup squad is revealed on 23 April and everyone scans down the list to see whether the name of Jofra Archer, uncapped and untested, is present or not.",

        "content": "Royal & Derngate, NorthamptonBarney Norris\u2019s adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Booker winner about the perils of blind duty speaks to modern Britain\n\u2018The play must be unlike the book or the film or it shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Barney Norris about his adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s story of unspoken loves and unburied pasts. Norris lives up to his word: his adaptation is not the intimate confession of Ishiguro\u2019s Booker prize-winner, centring on the inner world of the emotionally repressed butler, Stevens. Nor is it primarily about his almost-romance with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton, dramatised in the Oscar-nominated film.\nWhat is drawn out here is a more panoramic story of collective guilt and shame in postwar Britain as Stevens looks back at his \u2013 and the nation\u2019s \u2013 wrong turnings. Stevens is consumed by the question of what makes a \u201cgreat butler\u201d and this production interrogates the blind duty that lead him to stay in service to Lord Darlington, an aristocrat with fascist sympathies in the 1930s who calls for the appeasement of Hitler.\nStevens\u2019 crime of passivity in the face of rising rightwing European politics carries subtle contemporary resonances, though some parallels to Brexit Britain are made more heavy-handedly. \u201cI do not want my decision on Europe to be decided by the average man,\u201d says one character.\nWhere Ishiguro\u2019s original story slipped between two time-frames \u2013 the 1950s of Stevens\u2019 present and his memories from two decades earlier \u2013 here the past converges on stage alongside the present in dramatic doubleness. Characters that Stevens meets on his 1950s motor trip to the West Country remain on stage, while figures from his 1930s past breeze in, intercepting the present in parallel scenes. The past is far more compelling than the present, and characters from the latter world appear too much like devices that fill the gaps between the real drama. Despite this, the technique works in its best moments to create a chilly tension, and the palimpsest of past voices creates psychological layering and imbues Steven\u2019s present with regret and shame.\nStephen Boxer gives a deft \u201cdouble\u201d performance as Stevens, switching between emotional registers in past and present time-frames. He excels at quietly tortured blankness, too, and there is a heart-stopping scene of emotional impotence at his father\u2019s deathbed: \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re feeling better,\u201d he tells Stevens Senior, putting duty first as he rushes back to tend to Lord Darlington\u2019s guests.\nNiamh Cusack inhabits Miss Kenton with even greater conviction, by turns mischievous and steely willed in her challenges to Stevens\u2019 authority. We feel her frustration over his inability to express his feelings for her, but not until the final part of the play. The romance between them, in fact, feels more like friendship for the main.\nLily Arnold\u2019s set is clean, uncomplicated and carries an exquisite visual power: gilt panels glide along the stage to convey old-world English opulence but also subterfuge, secrecy and shadow worlds. Elena Pe\u00f1a\u2019s sound design of pounding rain and clopping horse\u2019s hooves has a cinematic quality.\nThe pace of Christopher Haydon\u2019s production feels slow, and the emotions underplayed, but by deliberately holding back it gives us well-orchestrated, cerebral theatre.\n At the Royal & Derngate, Northampton, until 16 March. Then touring.",

It also said fly control was up by a third in the UK and it dealt with 14% more rat problems.\nAndy Ransom, the chief executive, said the international surge in call-outs to deal with rodents and insects, particularly in the second half of the year as the heat reached its peak, had made for a very good year for Rentokil.\nAs temperatures reached record levels, experts warned that rats were enjoying perfect conditions, with rubbish left out in the street rotting faster and fruit ripening earlier.\nAccording to the British Pest Control Association, the prolonged heatwave resulted in a plague of wasps, \u201cthe worst in recent years\u201d. The BPCA\u2019s technical officer, Natalie Bungay, said the organisation\u2019s members had been destroying up to 12 wasp nests a day.\nFlying ants wrought havoc at Wimbledon, prompting complaints from Caroline Wozniacki, then Australian open champion, who urged the umpire to take action against the swarm.\nAs pest plagues spread through Europe and beyond, the Russian city of Volgograd deployed helicopters to spray marshland with pesticides, after players were assaulted by mosquitoes and midges at the football World Cup.\nThe continent-wide increase in call-outs to battle wasps, flies and rats helped Rentokil\u2019s pest control division to report an annual income of nearly \u00a31.6bn, with underlying sales up 10% in Europe and 4% in the UK.\nThe southern hemisphere also experienced a sweltering summer, with New Zealand suffering a tenfold increase in rodent numbers, dealing a blow to its efforts to eradicate alien species of rat, mouse, stoat and possum by 2050.\nRentokil, founded in 1924 by Harold Maxwell-Lefroy, professor of entomology at Imperial College London, said its annual meeting would be held this year at Gatwick airport; which is close to Crawley.",

        "content": "The musician is under criminal investigation for his conduct, yet has made no moves to cancel his UK tour - leaving angry fans with tickets they can\u2019t sell, or even return\n\u2018I won\u2019t go whether I sell them or not,\u201d says Richard Moore, who had bought tickets to see Ryan Adams at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 3 April. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s going to be anything other than a disaster or a total circus. The atmosphere is going to be tainted, he is obviously not in a good place, he has a history of reacting badly if the heckles aren\u2019t to his liking, and I imagine while some of the audience will stay away, others will turn up to make their feelings heard. It could be the shortest show in history with one of the most toxic atmospheres.\u201d\nAdams\u2019 forthcoming UK tour \u2013 which begins at the Albert Hall for the first of two nights on 2 April, then takes in shows in Newcastle, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Sheffield, before concluding in Cambridge on 11 April \u2013 is shaping up to be some bizarre combination of damp squib and lightning rod.\nOn 13 February, the New York Times published a detailed report featuring accounts from a series of women who alleged Adams had manipulated them, promising help with their careers and then making sexual and emotional demands. It also reported his sexualised text exchanges with a teenage girl, with Adams at one point telling her: \u201cIf people knew they would say I was like R Kelley [sic] lol.\u201d (Adams has apologised to \u201canyone I have ever hurt\u201d, but described the report as \u201cupsettingly inaccurate\u201d.) Since then, he has become the focal point of demands that the music industry address sexual harassment and manipulation by powerful male artists and executives. The result is that many fans who had bought tickets for his tour intend to stay away.\nOne female fan, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian she had paid \u00a3164.10, including booking fees, for the \u201cRyan\u2019s Pinball Lair Experience\u201d at Adams\u2019 show at the O2 Apollo in Manchester on 7 April. \u201cI felt physically sick reading the article. I don\u2019t want to support such a person. He could have used his \u2018apology\u2019 tweet to really apologise and atone for his actions. He did not.\u201d\nPlenty of tickets remain available for Adams\u2019 tour, both through venues, and secondary ticketing sites. But for fans trying to get rid of their tickets, there\u2019s a problem: no one wants them. Elliot \u2013 who asked that his surname not be used \u2013 has tried selling to friends and through a secondary site. \u201cPeople have just said the same as me: they have no interest in seeing him. Silence on Facebook and no response on Twickets.\u201d\nMany fans feel they should receive refunds. Others believe the shows should be cancelled. The problem with this is Adams\u2019 own stance. Despite his next album being pulled from release, his own guitarist calling him a \u201cmonster\u201d, and the loss of three sponsors, Adams has made no move to cancel his tour. According to Simon Long, a founding partner of the music and entertainment law firm Collins Long, there is no way out for the UK promoters, ticketing agencies and venues: they are bound by the terms of whatever contracts they signed with Adams and his management. \u201cUntil such time as we have contracts \u2013 and this is a lesson for the music industry \u2013 that say things like \u2018Thou shalt behave like a saint, and if you don\u2019t we have the right to cancel the tour\u2019, there\u2019s no way out for the promoters.\u201d\nThe promoter, in this instance SJM, did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Nor did any intermediaries, ticket vendors or venues. The only comment came from the Royal Albert Hall: \u201cThe venue is being hired by a third party promoter, SJM, for the Ryan Adams concerts. The promoter has advised us that the concerts are still scheduled to go ahead. We are continuing to monitor this situation very closely.\u201d The RAH\u2019s spokesperson appended a short note: \u201cJust to flag though, the phrase \u2018definitely going ahead\u2019 would be a misquote.\u201d\nIn fact, Long says, morality clauses have started appearing in music industry contracts, but usually only in relationship to sponsorship, where the artist is being treated as a brand ambassador. \u201cThey are clauses such as: \u2018The artist must conduct themselves in a first-class manner.\u2019 What does that mean? I would say it means you don\u2019t find yourself accused of improper conduct.\u201d In the case of the Adams tour, though, he says the fans are the only ones likely to take action \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for the promoter, who has said \u2018I will pay you X to play your songs for 90 minutes. It\u2019s up to the fans whether they want to come or not. That\u2019s the real sanction.\u201d\nAs one promoter, speaking anonymously, puts it: \u201cIf the promoter cancelled, it\u2019s a grey area, and a new area, but its 99% likely that the promoter would then be liable for all costs. I do wonder if morality clauses will indeed start to be factored in now.\u201d\nThat\u2019s no help to the fans still wondering what to do about their Ryan Adams tickets. Some have been angered by the lack of communication from venues, promoters and ticket vendors. The standard response from Ticketmaster to inquiries about refunds has been: \u201cTicketmaster only offers exchanges or refunds for tickets where the event is cancelled \u2013 this is set by the venue and event organisers as it is on their behalf that we sell tickets. I\u2019m sorry we\u2019re unable to help further with this.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has kept us informed, and that\u2019s the promoter\u2019s fault,\u201d says one fan, who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cI actually feel sorry for the venues who are probably equally in the dark and concerned about losing income.\u201d\n\u201cThe lack of clarity hasn\u2019t been helpful,\u201d says one fan who is still planning to see Adams in Dublin, and has tickets for one of the Albert Hall shows. \u201cIt was touted by Adams as a big tour, with big names in the band and surprises and so on, so when the record is dropped, and his guitarist leaves, then I think some clarification about what is happening or what to expect would be good. However, I suspect it\u2019s brinkmanship by the venues, promoters and management as many people stand to lose a large amount of money by cancelling.\u201d\nAt the heart of it all is Adams\u2019s intransigence. Apart from his statement contesting the accuracy of the New York Times piece, he has remained silent. This, more than anything, is what has angered the fans the Guardian spoke to.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t see it going well,\u201d says ticket-holder Susan Paterson, who will be staying away. \u201cApart from any reflection on whether it\u2019s the right thing to do morally, it\u2019s surely opening himself up to protests and disruptions. How can he sing songs like Harder Now That It\u2019s Over or Nobody Girl after all that\u2019s come out? How can he cover Taylor Swift?\u201d\n\u201cThe artist should have pulled the shows immediately, SJM should have pulled them, the Royal Albert Hall should have cancelled the hire of the venue by SJM,\u201d says Michael Hall, who plans to sell his Albert Hall tickets and donate the money to Solace Women\u2019s Aid. \u201cThey should have been falling over one another to do the right thing \u2013 instead they\u2019ve done nothing. Their silence, as in so many of these cases, speaks volumes.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see how the tour is tenable,\u201d says Callum Hussey, who had also bought Albert Hall tickets. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine half-full venues, protests outside, choruses of boos, projectile pints. Does Adams seriously expect anything different? If he really thinks the tour can go ahead without a hitch, I expect the Dublin crowd might convince him otherwise on opening night.\u201d",

        "content": "Figure falls as EU migrants from eastern European countries leave or stay away\nNet migration of EU migrants to the UK has dropped to its lowest level for almost a decade, as eastern European citizens choose to leave or stay away.\nThe Office for National Statistics said that net migration from EU countries had dropped to 57,000 people in the year to September 2018, its lowest level since 2009. Migration to the UK from outside the EU, however, rose at a much faster rate.\nTotal net migration remained broadly unchanged from a year ago, but the figures mask a shifting pattern since the Brexit vote.\nOver the year, 627,000 people arrived in the UK while 345,000 people left.\nNet migration from countries outside the EU was the highest since 2004, with the net addition of 261,000 migrants from the rest of the world, part of a steady increase in non-EU immigration over the past five years.\nThe latest analysis of migration trends to Britain is likely to reflect the shifting conditions for EU migrants working in Britain following the slide in the value of the pound, which makes it less attractive for them to work in the UK. Eastern European economies have also seen rapid wage growth in recent years, narrowing the gap with the UK.\nMadeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThe overall story the data tell on EU migration is clear. Britain is not as attractive to EU migrants as it was a couple of years ago.\n\u201cEU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum, so at least some of this decline would probably have happened anyway, even without Brexit.\u201d\nIt also comes as Theresa May prepares tougher post-Brexit immigration rules to aid the Conservatives\u2019 target to reduce net migration below 100,000 a year, a yardstick she has stuck to firmly since her time as home secretary.\nWith migration viewed as a key reason behind the Brexit vote, the prime minister has made ending freedom of movement between Britain and the EU a red line in talks with Brussels over the country\u2019s future relationship.\nShe has previously said EU migrants would no longer be able to \u201cjump the queue\u201d after Britain leaves.\nBusiness groups have, however, responded with alarm as labour shortages rise across the country, particularly in areas where EU migrants have typically filled jobs in recent years, such as hospitality, agriculture, manufacturing and construction.\nTim Thomas, the director of labour market and skills at manufacturers\u2019 body Make UK, said: \u201cA substantial national skills shortage means that close to a third of manufacturing vacancies are hard to fill. Reducing the flow of EU workers makes this problem bigger.\u201d\nAnalysts said that the drop in net EU migration had been fuelled by a fall in people coming to the UK for work, with the total number of non-UK EU workers dropping by 61,000 over the year to stand at 2.3 million.\nIn contrast, statisticians said that migration from the rest of the world was driven higher by rising numbers of international students coming to the country. Non-EU workers also increased by 130,000 over the year to 1.3 million.\nStephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile UK politicians are seemingly unable to provide any clarity on where Britain is heading post-Brexit, EU migrants are increasingly doing so \u2013 by leaving.\u201d",

But the federal resources minister Matt Canavan has declared the Coalition\u2019s approach to developing the industry \u201cwon\u2019t blindly turn our back on coal and the jobs it supports.\u201d\nHydrogen is being promoted as a replacement for natural gas. It is being used overseas in the transport sector and in electricity generation.\nLast December, the chief scientist Alan Finkel recommended state and federal energy ministers take three immediate steps to develop the industry. He recommended work to allow up to 10% hydrogen in the domestic gas network, including making the required regulatory changes and implementation of technical standards.\nHe said governments should scope potential for building hydrogen refueling stations in every state and territory, focussed on heavy transport, and undertake what he termed \u201cco-ordinated international outreach to keep building Australia\u2019s profile with major trading partners as a potential supplier\u201d.\nFinkel said heavy vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells could meet increasing demand for zero-emissions transport, and replacing natural gas with hydrogen was an economical way of decarbonising direct combustion.\nFinkel told ministers if Australia moved assertively into the hydrogen market, the country could build an export industry worth $1.7bn and provide employment for 2,800 people by 2030. He also noted that most of the jobs created would likely be in regional areas \u201cat sites of hydrogen production, storage and loading for export\u201d.\nHe identified Japan, South Korea and China as the likely main export markets, and noted \u201cthe window of opportunity to capture emerging markets in Asia is a small one\u201d.\n\u201cAustralia has competitive advantages, such as access to infrastructure and large renewable energy potential, but must act swiftly and in a coordinated way to ensure Australia\u2019s place in the hydrogen value chain,\u201d the chief scientist said.\nThe Coalition has already given a $50m grant to a coal-to-hydrogen project in the La Trobe Valley which is being spearheaded by a consortium of Japanese companies with the support of the Japanese government.\nEnvironmental groups are positive in principle about the potential for Australia to develop a hydrogen export industry, but argue it should be powered by renewables rather than by gas or coal otherwise it will not assist a necessary transition to low emissions energy.\nMoving ahead with a hydrogen strategy comes at the end of a week where Scott Morrison has attempted to reposition the government on climate and energy policy, with Liberals under attack in their heartland from independents campaigning against incumbents because of the government\u2019s record of frustrating climate policy action.\nOver the past week, Morrison has revived Tony Abbott\u2019s emissions reduction fund, and pledged support for the Snowy 2.0 expansion, kicked in $56m for the Marinus link, and flagged further taxpayer underwriting of the \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d proposal in Tasmania.\nWhile the government is trying to send a more positive message about its disposition on emissions reduction, official figures have cut across the pre-election messaging, confirming pollution is continuing to rise, a trend that has been in evidence since the Coalition repealed Labor\u2019s carbon price in 2013.\nEmissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors.\nWhile the government this week has outlined actions which is says are consistent with Australia meetings its Paris commitments, it has confirmed it intends to count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits, which is not practical emissions reduction but an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030.\nIt is also factoring in emissions reduction from the Snowy 2.0 expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy for which there are no details; the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from unspecified \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d and \u201cother sources of abatement\u201d such as projects under development but not yet contracted.",

In the three years up to October 2018, an average of about 7% of licence renewal notices were returned to the registry due to incorrect addresses every month.\nAnd while the auditor\u2019s report found the registry was responsive in updating data relating to potential criminal activity, its \u201cprocesses do not ensure sound and consistent decisions for licence suspensions or revocations\u201d.\nIt said that decisions on licence suspensions or revocations were made by \u201cjunior staff\u201d and that 27% of appeals against revocations had been successful in the three years leading up to 2016.\nThe auditor said that was evidence of \u201cinconsistent or unsound decision making\u201d which could pose a risk to public safety.\n\u201cMoreover, an additional and greater risk to public and police safety is that due to the limited supervision, staff may make unsound decisions not to suspend or revoke licences, but these will not be tested by an appeal,\u201d the report stated.\n\u201cThe registry does not have a policy to quality review these decisions.\u201d\nThe role of the registry came under increased scrutiny last year after it was revealed that John Edwards, the 68-year-old who shot dead his two teenage children in Sydney last July, was given a permit by the registry despite having warned other clubs not to let him near firearms only months before.\nWhile it didn\u2019t mention Edwards \u2013 whose case is still to go before the state\u2019s coroner \u2013 it detailed a litany of criticisms in its operations.\nThe auditor\u2019s report also stated that the state\u2019s entire firearms register is based on outdated technology and is heavily reliant on manual data entry which \u201ccan be prone to errors\u201d.\nIn addition, the registry had not completed any \u201crisk-based safe storage\u201d inspections \u2013 designed to help police target \u201chigher risk\u201d firearms licence holders \u2013 since July 2018.\nHowever, in an appendix to the report the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, disputed some of the auditor\u2019s findings, saying the registry was part of a \u201cco-regulatory\u201d system involving the NSW Police, licence holders, dealers and gun ranges.\n\u201cThere are regulatory obligations placed on firearm licence holders, such as maintaining currency of data with the Firearms Registry and approved clubs, such as providing confirmation that the club member meets the requisite safe storage requirements,\u201d Fuller said in his response.\n\u201cThe performance audit findings do not sufficiently acknowledge that they mainly arise from the co-regulatory nature of the scheme.\u201d\nBut, the auditor general said she had \u201cnot found evidence during the course of this audit, that firearms regulation could reasonably be interpreted as being co-regulatory\u201d.\nSaying firearms legislation in NSW requires police to administer regulation through the Firearms Registry.\nIn fact, she said that Fuller\u2019s characterisation of a \u201cco-regulatory\u201d environment would be \u201can inherent conflict of interest\u201d.\n\u201cAn inherent conflict of interest would arise in the circumstance where firearms dealers, clubs and ranges benefit from the use of firearms and regulate their use,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cUnder the act, clubs, dealers, ranges and licensees have responsibilities \u2013 not regulatory oversight. Clubs and ranges have obligations to undertake certain actions against club members or users in accordance with the act and regulation.\u201d\nThe report has prompted gun control advocates to call for greater resources for the registry.\n\u201cThe registry plays a vital role in regulating firearm ownership and in making gun laws effective,\u201d Samantha Lee, the head of Gun Control Australia said.\n\u201cThe auditor-general\u2019s report identifies a number of alarming problems and highlights what is needed to improve the role of the registry.\n\u201cFor years the gun lobby has been actively undermining the registry and failing to support this fundamental institution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the commissioner for police, the government and all political players got behind this important institution and provide the resources required to ensure it operates at the highest level.\u201d",

        "content": "Green finance experts say Australia is out of step with World Bank, Europe and the US, which are using funding to combat global warming \nAustralia is the only developed country that allows climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants, green finance experts say.\nExperts say allowing Vales Point coal-fired power station to register with the Morrison government\u2019s emissions reduction fund, rebadged this week as a \u201cclimate solutions\u201d policy, puts Australia out of step with the World Bank, Europe and the US, which have all rejected using climate financing for coal power retrofits.\nThe World Bank has issued US$13bn in green bonds since 2008 to stimulate spending to combat global warming.\nChina has used green bonds to help build new coal-fired plants to replace older, dirtier stations on the grounds it reduces nitrogen-based emissions causing the country\u2019s oppressive air pollution. But it announced in December it would no longer consider \u201cclean coal\u201d plants \u2013 which still emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas \u2013 investments in green technology.\nSean Kidney, chief executive of the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative, says China\u2019s shift leaves Australia out on its own.\n\u201cIf you were committed to meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the Australian government says it is committed to, this is just lunacy,\u201d Kidney says.\n\u201cNo investors in the western world will accept any green bonds that incentivise anything like coal station retrofits. From an investor\u2019s perspective, coal is a dead duck.\u201d\nEmma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, says Australia is moving across the trend by considering giving taxpayer support to coal. In addition to the potential support through the climate solutions fund, the government is considering underwriting the cost of building new coal-fired power stations.\nIn the past fortnight, mining giant Glencore has said it will cap coal production in response to pressure from shareholders, while Rio Tinto stressed it was the only large mining company with no fossil fuel investments, having sold its final coal assets to Glencore last year.\n\u201cAt a time when private-sector capital is increasingly looking for low carbon and decarbonisation opportunities, it would seem to be swimming against the tide to put government taxpayer funding into these [coal] activities,\u201d Herd says.\nLast year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that  limiting global warming to 1.5C \u2013 a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement \u2013 would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030.\nWhile global markets increasingly recognise a decline in coal use is inevitable, the shift away from it has been fitful. The Global Carbon Project found global emissions were likely to have hit a new high in 2018, in part due to an increase in coal burning in China. It bucked a global decline in emissions from coal in 2015 and 2016.\nThough it has been registered, Vales Point coal plant is yet to bid for money from the emissions reduction fund due to a dispute over whether it needs to reduce its carbon intensity to less than the grid average to win a government contract. The plant\u2019s owners say the project would reduce emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant\u2019s emissions over that time.\nThe environment minister, Melissa Price, has backed the interpretation of the Clean Energy Regulator, which says the project does not qualify in its current form. The company disagrees, noting former environment minister Greg Hunt said the fund could be used to \u201cclean up\u201d power plants and that published guidelines explicitly said coal could win backing. The methodology is being reviewed by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee.\nEven if Vales Point is not successful, critics such as the Australian Conservation Foundation say there is nothing preventing other coal-fired plant owners from applying for a climate subsidy. Major companies are being paid from the fund for other fossil fuel projects: South African miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant the company says it would have built regardless; Rio Tinto has received $2m for a diesel-fired power plant at a bauxite mine.\nWith prime minister Scott Morrison announcing the Coalition would top up the $2.55bn fund with an additional $2bn over a decade, economists and environmentalists have called for emissions from fossil fuels to be dealt with through different policies and for the fund to focus on projects that restore or protect natural habitat.\nExperts say the scheme will be improved if the government tightens the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was promised to limit emissions from big industry but which has largely allowed major companies to nominate their own pollution.\nNational emissions have increased each year since the emissions reduction fund replaced the abolished carbon price scheme in 2014. Money from the fund is distributed via reverse auction, with land owners and businesses bidding for contracts to reduce emissions cheaply.\nAnalyses have found some projects under the fund have merit but it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere.",

        "content": "Former Go-Betweens frontman\u2019s seventh solo album might be an acquired taste but nevertheless gets under your skin\nHere in Brisbane, the heat has finally broken. For 46 days in a row, the mercury exceeded 30C. The previous record was 27 days, in 2017. While the north has been awash, the wet season here has failed. I\u2019m listening to the title track of the new Robert Forster album. It\u2019s called Inferno (Brisbane in Summer). You might think it looks like paradise, he sings, but everyone here is screaming: \u201cLet me, let me, let me, let me, let me out!\u201d\nForster has written about the weather in Brisbane before. On his 2008 album The Evangelist, recorded during a similarly excruciating period of mind-melting heat, the first song was called If It Rains. At the time, we thought it might never rain here again. Not that Inferno is any kind of manifesto. This is not a climate change concept album. It\u2019s a Robert Forster record, which means buckets of atmosphere, dry wit, subtle pleasures and unerring quality.\nWhile Forster\u2019s last album, Songs to Play, was recorded close to his home patch in the hills west of Brisbane, for Inferno he escaped to Berlin, where he recorded his first solo album, Danger in the Past, in 1990. And where Songs to Play featured a drier sound and coiled, latent energy, Inferno, produced by Victor Van Vugt, is lush and tropical, and it moves at a slightly more languid pace.\nThe first song on this record is called Crazy Jane on the Day of Judgement. I have no idea what that refers to, and frankly couldn\u2019t care less; it might be the best title since the Go-Betweens cut Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express in 1986. There\u2019s a simple four-note progression, a ride cymbal, Forster\u2019s wife Karin Baumler pulling insistently at the song\u2019s edges on violin. Forster doesn\u2019t sing much, but the melody is inferred and fleshed out by his players.\nThat\u2019s how Forster\u2019s albums get under your skin. He\u2019s very much an acquired taste, but lyric-driven songs that seem tuneless on the surface are the ones you find yourself humming later. And the ones that seem most banal, like The Morning, have a wisdom that hits you later. \u201cThe morning is a friend,\u201d he says. After all, you never know when you might not wake up. The world might be cooking, but Forster remains an eternal optimist.\nHe\u2019s also a marathoner, not a sprinter. He\u2019s 61 now, with seven solo albums under his belt around the nine he made with the Go-Betweens, and he is one of Australian music\u2019s elders. He doesn\u2019t sell remotely as many records as Nick Cave, a close peer and friend, or Paul Kelly. On the song Remain, he says, \u201cI did my good work, knowing it wasn\u2019t my time.\u201d The groove of this song is totally relaxed as he speaks of being overlooked and forgotten.\nForster doesn\u2019t care. Not only is he an optimist, he\u2019s supremely self-assured. He knows what he does is good without needing the validation of others. No Fame contains the lines \u201cI\u2019m gonna write a novel that is set a hundred years ago / The custom and the carriage of the people, well, I don\u2019t know.\u201d While others overtake him, Forster is content to cruise and to observe, knowing that one day they\u2019ll catch up with him \u2013 not the other way around.\nAfter the big heat, listening to this album is like spring rain.\n Inferno is out now through Tapete Records",

While these would-be crossbenchers are not national household names, they are locally connected and will test the ideas, electorate voting cultures and resources of sitting MPs.\nPolitical disengagement, climate, water and regional services rate highly on their platforms though each have local nuance which is so important in such seats.\nJoyce will face a challenge from rural sustainability strategist and small businessman Adam Blakester, who comes from Werris Creek, the same place as the seat\u2019s former independent Tony Windsor.\nJoyce holds the seat on a margin of 23%, following the 2017 byelection over his dual citizenship. The contest will test Joyce\u2019s standing following the fallout from his affair (not public prior to the byelection), but more particularly, his record as agriculture minister on issues such as live export and water management.\nBlakester has been organising for four months. Like Cathy McGowan\u2019s \u201ckitchen table conversations\u201d, he says he will consult with locals to construct a policy platform, but climate change and sustainability is already trending in his conversations.\nBut his non-negotiable priority is proper political and public governance: how politicians interact on the floor of parliament, with the media, with each other and flowing from that, an effective anti-corruption commission.\n\u201cI think there is real discontent across Australia and here in New England \u2013 I hear it\u2019s like a school yard but as someone who has done a lot of work with schools, I wouldn\u2019t use children as a metaphor, I wouldn\u2019t use dogs; we need a new metaphor,\u201d Blakester said.\n\u201cSome of their behaviour makes Taiwan\u2019s parliament look good.\u201d\nCloser to Sydney, an adventurer, environmentalist and small businessman who was named by Time magazine as one of 25 \u201cworldwide responsibility pioneers\u201d will challenge energy minister Angus Taylor in Hume.\nHuw Kingston won the Time title after he campaigned successfully to stop the sale of still bottled water in his hometown of Bundanoon. He needs to beat a 1o% margin in Hume which is a tricky seat that stretches from the outskirts of Sydney through the southern highlands and down to farming country near Canberra.\nKingston is more overt than Blakester about his pledge to campaign on climate change and specifically a renewable energy target of 60% by 2035 \u2013 compared with the Coalition\u2019s abandoned target and Labor\u2019s 50% target by 2030.\nHe wants to see a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin, a national policy to phase out single-use plastics, no new large-scale coalmines including Adani, an increase in the current annual refugee intake from 20,000 to 30,000, closure of Manus Island and Nauru detention centres, a very fast train link between Sydney and Canberra, and better regional health and education services.\nMalcolm Turnbull\u2019s demise got Kingston thinking about politics at a time when more reports were issued about the state of the climate. It was a \u201cnow or never\u201d proposition.\n\u201cThe story getting common for those standing and for the people out in Australia is how disappointed they are with political system over last 10 years, but it was the rolling of Turnbull in August that fired me up,\u201d Kingston said.\n\u201cI was pissed off as a taxpayer. What other job could you do where you would be allowed to stay and do a job while destabilising inside the workplace?\n\u201cPoliticians have been playing games instead of governing and it is all going on while the world continues to warm up and no one is doing anything about it.\u201d\nDifferent again is ex-policeman and Albury mayor Kevin Mack who is challenging Sussan Ley in the 127,000sq km seat of Farrer. Mack is more old-style country politician, reflecting the nature of his seat.\nHe presents as a mix of Labor and Liberal strands. Mack admires Paul Keating\u2019s intellect in driving the agenda of the Hawke government, but says the National\u2019s Doug Anthony was the last major party representative with \u201ca decent regional focus\u201d.\nMack says he is focused on the whole seat, the small towns that add ballast and productivity to the larger centres such as Albury and Griffith. Water is a big issue in the electorate, including its quality and the productivity derived from water. But he also names regional services as a concern.\n\u201cConnectivity, transport, NBN, mobile phone towers are nonexistent in Farrer,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 22% unemployment, which is a significant problem. If you fix water, you fix employment. And investing in mental health from the front end rather than the back end.\u201d\nMack has connected with nearby independent candidates, including Helen Haines who is hoping to replace McGowan in Indi, and Ray Kingston, the former Yarriambiack mayor hoping to win the safe seat Mallee after the unexpected retirement of the National Andrew Broad.\nIt is these conversations that are changing things on the ground in rural electorates. That, combined with candidates who are more confident to challenge the notions of what a rural voter is and the policies that voters may support.",

She\u2019s about to learn a lot.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone could out-sleaze Donald Trump but you did it, my friend,\u201d Meyers marveled. \u201cYou were trying to intimidate a witness on Twitter. What\u2019s next? Are you going to Instagram a photo of a brick with the caption, \u2018About to throw this through your window?\u2019\u201d\nCohen repeated many of the allegations swirling around Trump for months: that he knew of the meeting between Don Jr and Russian officials, that he knew Roger Stone was talking to WikiLeaks about leaked Democratic National Committee emails, and that he directed Cohen to use campaign funds to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nIn sum, Cohen \u201clisted off a bunch of alleged crimes committed by the president on national TV\u201d while he was in Hanoi to meet North Korean premier Kim Jong-un \u2013 \u201cso ironic\u201d, said Meyers, since \u201cTrump finally went to Vietnam and he\u2019s getting killed back home\u201d.\nOne of the most stunning parts of the hearing, Meyers continued, was the stark difference in questioning between Democrats and Republicans. Many congressional Republicans refused to ask about the president\u2019s alleged crimes; one, Paul Gosar of Arizona (whose own siblings memorably endorsed his opponent in 2018), brought a large posterboard of Cohen\u2019s face that blared \u201cliar, liar, pants on fire\u201d.\n\u201cI feel bad for the intern who had to go to Kinko\u2019s and print out a giant copy of Michael Cohen\u2019s face,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cCan you imagine what the employees at Kinko\u2019s thought? \u2018Oh, is this for some kind a joke?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s for Congress,\u201d he answered, shaking his head. \u201cThis is a thing for Congress.\u201d\nFrom Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also picked up on Republicans\u2019 faux righteousness over Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThe Republicans were relentless in their blind defense of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir strategy today seemed to be, \u2018We don\u2019t believe this liar. We believe the other liar.\u2019\u201d\nIn all seriousness, Kimmel said it\u2019s \u201cdisturbing to me that these Republicans \u2026 seemed to have no interest whatsoever in learning whether or not the president committed a crime\u201d. They barely asked questions about the president\u2019s conduct; in fact, \u201cthey didn\u2019t even pretend they cared\u201d.\nInstead, Kimmel said: \u201cThey were behaving like they had this image of Trump raging around his hotel room in his underpants watching them on TV, so they had to make a stand.\u201d\nIt was a truly a marvelous performance of political bluster, Kimmel continued. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen acting from Republicans like this since Arnold Schwarzenegger in Jingle All the Way.\u201d\nThere were some humorous moments, however, such as Cohen\u2019s claim that Trump was so insecure about his past grades that he directed Cohen to intimidate his alma maters into not releasing them.\nIt is funny \u2013 until you remember that Trump is currently in talks with Kim. \u201cDon\u2019t anyone panic, but he\u2019s talking about the guy negotiating a nuclear arms agreement right now,\u201d Kimmel said.\nThe hearing was a prime showcase for America\u2019s partisan division, but Kimmel found one example of cross-aisle agreement: Cohen reported that Trump routinely said Donald Trump Jr has the \u201cworst judgment of anyone in the world\u201d.\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also covered Cohen\u2019s testimony that America\u2019s president is a \u201cracist, a conman, and a cheat\u201d, revelations that \u201cwould\u2019ve been big news if it wasn\u2019t the slogan for the Trump 2020 campaign\u201d.\nMichael Cohen spills some executive-level tea and brings receipts \u2615\ufe0f\ud83d\ude32\u2757\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9Irw83Xjg8\nNoah paid particular attention to the first claim \u2013 racist \u2013 which predictably drove the hearing off the rails for a time. Cohen said Trump said racist things in private, such as that black people were too stupid to vote for him.\n\u201cBlack people wouldn\u2019t vote for you, Trump, because they\u2019re too stupid? No, Donald. Actually, the reason black people wouldn\u2019t vote for you is because of your trash-ass weave,\u201d Noah chided. \u201cAlso the 50 years of documented racism, but also the weave, my friend.\u201d\nThe charge of racism prompted Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina to trot out what Noah called the \u201cblack friend defense\u201d \u2013 the idea that, because Trump employed Lynne Patton, a black official in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he cannot possibly be racist.\n\u201cWhenever the Trumps are accused of racism, they always bring the same woman,\u201d Noah observed. \u201cIf you can only bring one black person every time, something tells me you don\u2019t have black friends.\u201d",

The police searched for him for months but were unaware that he had been killed \u201cin a savage attack\u201d days before his 18th birthday.\nGary Hopkins, 36, and Stacey Docharty, 28, are both charged with murder, perverting the course of justice and preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. Both defendants appeared in court on Thursday for the start of what is expected to be a month-long trial at the Old Bailey.\n\u201cHaving killed him, they then wrapped up his body inside a duvet cover. They hid it in their attic along with the murder weapons,\u201d Gareth Patterson QC, the lead prosecutor, told the jury. \u201cThey did this to try to get away with what they had done. They were trying to obstruct, or as lawyers say, pervert the course of justice.\u201d\nThe body was only discovered eight months later in the defendants\u2019 second-floor flat in Enfield, north London, by which time it had suffered serious decomposition, Patterson said. A postmortem examination gave the cause of death as a blunt force trauma to the head and stab wounds to the chest.\nThe defendants were described as heavy drug users. The court heard that they also hid the murder weapons \u2013 a sharp knife with a 15.8cm blade, and a hammer broken in two parts \u2013 in their attic.\nThe jury was shown images of the defendants\u2019 flat, the murder weapons and the victim\u2019s clothes. Ali\u2019s family were visibly distressed and tearful throughout the prosecution\u2019s opening.\nThe jury were told that the defendants first revealed what they had done to their friend Stacie Collard when a group of them were using drugs in the flat. Some of the group, including Collard and Hopkins, left the flat and got into a car to withdraw cash and buy more drugs. Hopkins is alleged to have admitted the murder during the car journey, saying that when they got back to the flat he was going to go up to his partner Docharty and mention the attic and that they should watch her reaction.\nWhen they got back to the flat Hopkins allegedly told Docharty: \u201cI\u2019ve told them about the attic.\u201d Docharty began to cry uncontrollably. Hopkins got a ladder and went to the attic and showed a member of the group inside. The prosecution told the jury that Docharty had admitted the murder to other friends.\nPatterson said there was plenty of evidence linking both defendants to the murder and concealment of the body. Hopkins\u2019 DNA was found on the strap and Scart lead wrapped around its head over a bin bag. His fingerprints were also found on the bin bag and the outside of a Lidl bag that contained the murder weapons and the bloodstained clothing.\nPatterson told the jury that the evidence showed it must have been a savage attack.\nCollard said she had met Docharty at a children\u2019s home when she was 14. \u201cWe were like sisters,\u201d she told the jury, saying they would see each other regularly over the years. She told the court Docharty had admitted that Hopkins had killed Ali and she helped with the clean-up.\n \u201cHe [Ali] was sleeping on the settee. Gary had gone in with a hammer,\u201d Collard said, adding the attack occurred in the living room, but Docharty was listening in the bedroom. \u201cHe was hit over the head with the hammer to the point, this is what she [Docharty] said, that the hammer had broken. And it was at this point that she heard the man shout Gary\u2019s name. She then said Gary went into the kitchen to get a knife and stabbed him in the chest.\u201d \n Collard went on to tell the jury that Docharty had confessed to wrapping Ali in bed sheets and bin bags. \u201cPrior to that they went through his pockets and took what he had, which was money and drugs ... They then put him in the loft.\u201d\n Soon after being told about the murder, Collard said she decided to tell the police. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I was going to keep to myself,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI was driving myself insane thinking about what I\u2019d been told.\u201d\nHopkins has admitted perverting the course of justice and preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body, but both defendants deny the murder. Docharty also denies being involved in hiding the body and evidence of the killing.",

Invariably she would talk people into working for longer than they had planned, and her team were so productive that they kept coming back, and even more leaflets were delivered and doors knocked on.\nHer involvement was central to Lib Dem byelection victories in Eastbourne (1990), the Ribble Valley (1991), Newbury (1993), Christchurch (1993), Eastleigh (1994), Littleborough and Saddleworth (1995), Winchester (1997) and Romsey (2000), and in many other campaigns, such as when the party took Eastbourne back at the 2010 general election. In 1994, Pat was appointed MBE for political service.\nOne of seven children of Frances (nee Tracy) and Edward Maguire, Pat was born and raised in Tullamore, Co Offaly, in what was then the Irish Free State. Her father was a selector for the national rugby team. After leaving the Sacred Heart convent school in Tullamore, in 1954 she moved to Britain in search of work and became a PA to the managing director of Chrysler UK and Chrysler Europe.\nIn 1957 Pat married Derek Wainwright, and they had five children, Philippa, Rupert, Jeremy, Niall and James (my husband). Derek had qualified as a barrister and was a chief clerk of magistrates\u2019 courts. He was also a councillor for the Mortlake ward in Richmond, for what until 1988 was the Liberal party. Pat worked as his agent from 1974; the SDP-Liberal alliance took control of the council in 1983, and in 1984-85 the couple served as mayor and mayoress. Alan Watson benefited from Pat\u2019s support in coming second to the Conservatives in parliamentary elections, as did Adrian Slade in serving on the Greater London Council from 1981 until its abolition.\nDerek and Pat divorced in 1990, and from 2000 onwards she lived in Newhaven, East Sussex.\nA devoted reader, a keen tennis player, a follower of rugby and other sport, a horse rider and a fabulous cook, Pat did not mince her words. She had the most wicked sense of humour (one that occasionally made some sensitive souls burst into tears), a sharp mind and a heart of gold \u2013 and was loved, admired and feared by those who met her.\nShe is survived by her children, nine grandchildren and a great-grandson.",

She spoke, however, to a chamber where the seats were predominantly empty. At points, as few as 10 MPs sat on government benches, although the opposition side was more occupied. The lacklustre response to the debate from the government was in stark contrast to the condemnation by Downing Street to the thousands of children involved in the strike for climate change, calling it \u201ctruancy\u201d.\nMary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee, said politicians needed to shape and bend the financial system to invest in a green economy.\n\u201cTo achieve net zero [carbon emissions] we have to reduce our emissions rapidly and at scale in every area of our economy and our lives,\u201d she said.\nZac Goldsmith, Conservative MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, said last year\u2019s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report \u2013 detailing the difference between meeting a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels compared with 2C \u2013 gave the most alarming picture yet of the impact of climate change.\nHe said: \u201cIf you look at the trends, we are not heading for that apocalyptic 2 degree rise, we are heading something that looks more like 3 degrees, the consequences of which we cannot possibly estimate.\u201d\nIn light of that, he said \u201cthe idea of children missing a few hours of geometry or PE to wake our political system up is somehow the wrong thing to do just seems \u2026 absurd\u201d.\nCaroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, who secured the debate with Moran, said long-term climate targets had to be amended to net zero. She said even after all of the international conferences and pledges, the Earth was still set to warm by 3-4C.\n\u201cTime is quickly running out to limit warming even to the 1.5 or 2 degree aspirations of the IPCC.

He accepted it was a mistake to take on the role after being promoted to chief superintendent 19 days earlier and having not policed at Hillsborough since 1979.\nDuckenfield specifically accepted that the crush in the central \u201cpens\u201d three and four of the Leppings Lane terraces, which killed 96 people, was caused by his failure to close off a tunnel to direct incoming people away from those pens. He had previously ordered a large exit gate, C, to be opened at 2:52pm to let in about 2,000 people with tickets to support Liverpool who had been caught in serious congestion outside at the turnstiles.\nDuckenfield admitted that although gate C stayed open for five minutes, he did not consider where the incoming people would go. A match commander \u201cof reasonable competence\u201d ought to have thought about that, he agreed, and that his response had been \u201ca grave mistake\u201d. He had an insufficient grip of the ground\u2019s geography, he accepted, and that was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d.\nPaul Greaney QC put it to Duckenfield at the inquests that after gate C had been opened, he froze. Duckenfield at first disagreed, but Greaney persisted: \u201cMr Duckenfield, you know what was in your mind, and I will ask you just one last time. Will you accept that, in fact, you froze?\u201d\n \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Duckenfield replied.\nDuckenfield agreed that as match commander he led all of the officers policing the match and they were entitled to look to him for instruction and guidance. He accepted that he lacked experience and competence, and there was \u201ca whole series of things\u201d of which he was unaware or misunderstood.\nIn his preparations, he acknowledged that he had been unable to have a full discussion with the match commander he replaced, Ch Supt Brian Mole; that he had not seen the safety certificate for the ground, and did not know of overcrowding problems at the 1981 and 1988 semi-finals. He did not realise the Leppings Lane turnstile area was a bottleneck, and did not take steps to filter people to prevent congestion building up. He agreed that it was for him, and him alone, to decide if the 3pm kick-off should be delayed, which might have eased the pressure outside, and it was his failure not to do so.\nOf failing to close the tunnel after gate C was opened, Greaney put it to him: \u201cThat failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Duckenfield replied. Another barrister, John Beggs QC, then asked him \u201cwhether it has been easy \u2026 to admit that your professional failings led to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children, and the injuries to many more?\u201d\n\u201cSir, it has been the most difficult period of my life,\u201d he replied.\nDuckenfield, 74, denies gross negligence manslaughter in relation to 95 of the people killed. Graham Mackrell, 69, the former Sheffield Wednesday secretary and safety officer, has pleaded not guilty to two breaches of safety legislation.\nThe trial continues.",

        "content": "It can be difficult to maintain perspective when Chelsea enter crisis mode. Just as it was inevitable that Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s Carabao Cup final mutiny would be portrayed in some quarters as evidence of football\u2019s moral decay, so it is easy to fall into the trap of mistaking a resilient win over Tottenham as definitive proof of a unified dressing room.\nHold steady. The mood can change quickly at Chelsea, who have often given the impression of thriving on chaos during the Roman Abramovich era, and beating Spurs is unlikely to lull Maurizio Sarri into a false sense of security given he has spent most of his debut season in the Premier League pleading for patience. These are still dangerous times for a manager who cannot even make a simple substitution without it sparking an intense public-relations exercise.\nThat said it should be noted that Chelsea have handled Arrizabalaga\u2019s refusal to make way for Willy Caballero before the penalty shootout against Manchester City pretty well. From looking like a hapless supply teacher at Wembley, Sarri has managed to restore some authority after putting the world\u2019s most expensive goalkeeper in his place. Instead of striking a blow for player power, Arrizabalaga has paid the price for his disobedience, losing a week\u2019s wages and watching from the bench as Caballero kept a clean sheet against Spurs. Perhaps any other potential dissenters will think twice about crossing Sarri now.\nOr not. Even though these have been a good few days for the Chelsea manager, it would be naive of him to think his job is safe. Ask Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. Or Antonio Conte. Or Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\nFor now a situation that had the potential to spiral out of control has been contained. There is a determination to move on from the latest Stamford Bridge psychodrama and it was telling that Caballero, who has a strong claim to start again when Chelsea visit Fulham on Sunday, emerged after the Spurs game to insist his relationship with Arrizabalaga is not broken.\n\u201cWe spoke about it after the incident and it was good to have a chat,\u201d the 37-year-old Argentinian said. \u201cI think he learned lot from what happened. We learned a lot as a team and as a club. Sometimes these things pull players apart but in this case we are more together than ever. The boss decided to put me in goal and Kepa was supporting me in the warm-up, so I think we are in good harmony.\u201d\nSo Chelsea are one big happy family \u2013 a sentiment that will prompt cynics to reply that all the resentment will spill out the next time results turn. The critics can point to supporters turning during the dismal FA Cup defeat by Manchester United, the woeful collapses away from home in recent months and the feeling Sarri\u2019s style of play is too predictable, formulaic and monotonous to succeed in the Premier League. Optimists have less evidence to lean on, even if Chelsea have been strong at home against their immediate rivals in the league.\nYet if there is a major lesson for Chelsea to take from the Arrizabalaga farce perhaps it is appreciating the value of compromise. For the players that means not downing tools at the first sign of trouble. For the board that means accepting a manager who has never produced instant results will need time. And for Sarri it means not being quite so wedded to his philosophy and aesthetic principles.\nWith his system threatening to fall apart, Sarri had no option but to adapt, and the benefits of greater flexibility were clear as Chelsea dug in against City in the League Cup final and restricted them to a few goalscoring opportunities. It was the same against Spurs, who failed to muster a shot on target in a league game for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino.\nOnce again: take a few steps back. Spurs were hardly blown away by scintillating attacking football. Chelsea lacked a spark at times and were indebted to woeful defending for their goals, Pedro capitalising on slack covering by Toby Alderweireld for the first, Kieran Trippier entering his contender for own goal of the season for the second.\nHowever this is not the time for stubborn idealism and Sarri has shown he is capable of playing to this group\u2019s strengths. It was a performance straight out of one of Chelsea\u2019s title-winning seasons, with David Luiz and Antonio R\u00fcdiger marking Harry Kane out of the game, N\u2019Golo Kante relentless in midfield and opponents pressed into costly errors.\nNo doubt grinding out a result will not sit easily with Sarri. At a club locked into a culture of short-termism, however, he needs every win he can get and he has bought himself time after enjoying a couple of important victories on and off the pitch. The question is whether Chelsea can make the peace last long enough for Sarri to make his ideas work.",

The superjumbo pulled in far fewer orders from global airlines than expected and its cancellation means Rolls-Royce can expect to sell fewer engines.\nThe Trent 1000, which is used on Boeing\u2019s far more successful 787 Dreamliner plane, has meanwhile been beset with problems that caused several aircraft to be grounded last year.\nRolls-Royce has said the engines are wearing out faster than it expected. The company now says it has found a solution to the problem, but the cost of the setbacks increased from \u00a3554m in the first six months of last year to \u00a3790m by the end of the year \u2013 and could reach \u00a31.5bn over five years.\nFactoring in these one-off costs, Rolls-Royce lost \u00a3803m, sending its shares down nearly 3%. It was dragged to an overall pre-tax loss of \u00a32.9bn as a result of a \u00a32.1bn loss on its currency hedging activities, as sterling weakened against the dollar.\nThe \u00a32.9bn deficit compares with a \u00a33.9bn profit in 2017, a year in which it paid \u00a3671m to settle a bribery prosecution by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO dropped its investigation into the role of executives in the affair earlier this month.\nTo add to its woes, Rolls-Royce said it had also been forced to pull out of the race to make the engines that will power the next generation of mid-market jetliner planned by Boeing, warning it could not guarantee it would be able to deliver.\nIn a statement to the stock market, the company said: \u201cWe are unable to commit to the proposed timetable to ensure we have a sufficiently mature product which supports Boeing\u2019s ambition for the aircraft and satisfies our own internal requirements for technical maturity at entry into service.\u201d\nChris Cholerton, president of the engineer\u2019s civil aerospace division, said: \u201cThis is the right decision for Rolls-Royce and the best approach for Boeing.\n\u201cDelivering on our promises to customers is vital to us and we do not want to promise to support Boeing\u2019s new platform if we do not have every confidence that we can deliver to their schedule.\u201d",

The company\u2019s under-pressure shares fell a further 21.4% on on Thursday to \u00a310.80 after it revealed a loss for 2018, following a profit of \u00a384.5m in 2017, with flotation costs of \u00a3136m weighing on the balance sheet.\nJordan Hiscott, chief trader at trading platform Ayondo Markets, said: \u201cFrom an investor perspective, having IPO\u2019d at \u00a319 \u2026 it\u2019s been an abject failure. This has been even more eye-watering for the company itself with the cost of \u00a3136m to gain its public listing.\u201d\nAston Martin\u2019s shares were immediately demoted to a \u201csell\u201d by one City firm, which warned that investors in the Warwickshire-based carmaker faced a cash call from the company. \u201cWe can see a scenario where Aston Martin may need to return to investors for more capital to fund the business,\u201d said James Congdon of Canaccord Genuity.\nAfter the latest share slump Aston Martin\u2019s stock market valuation fell to \u00a32.5bn from \u00a34.3bn on flotation. At the time of the IPO, its chief executive, Andy Palmer, said the company wouldn\u2019t \u201cworry about what the shares are doing initially\u201d and would \u201clook over the longer term\u201d.\nThe 106-year-old company said flotation costs included \u00a361m in long-term share incentives for management and other staff. Other costs included money to pay off shareholders and payment for those firms advising on the listing.\nRevenues rose 25% to \u00a31.1bn in 2018, while car sales \u2013 including the Rapide and Vanquish models \u2013 were better than expected, up 26% to 6,441. Aston Martin said its special editions were in high demand.\nThe company said it was setting aside \u00a330m in readiness for no deal or a disorderly Brexit, including \u00a32m for revised supply chain routes. It has hired a new supply chain chief, stockpiled five days\u2019 worth of components and pallets to carry engines. The company has also made plans to bring in parts through naval ports if the Calais-Dover route gets clogged up, or will fly in components as a last resort.\nPalmer said a delay to Brexit would be a \u201cfurther annoyance\u201d. MPs could vote on whether to delay Brexit on 14 March, a fortnight before the scheduled departure date of 29 March.\nHe added: \u201cYou\u2019re holding that contingency stock for longer, which means that your working capital is tied up for longer. And continued uncertainty around Brexit means there is a propensity for EU and UK customers to delay purchases. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find a carmaker who wants this to go on any longer \u2026 I just want to get it over with.\u201d\nLaith Khalaf, a senior analyst at financial advisor Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\n\u201cBrexit casts a shadow, as it does for the rest of the UK car industry, and that may present some big road bumps in the immediate future if some sort of deal isn\u2019t reached between the UK and the EU.\u201d\nThe carmaker produced five new models last year: the Vantage and DBS Superleggera, along with special editions of the Vanquish Zagato sports cars and a remake of the DB4 GT Continuation, which won on its race debut at Silverstone in 1959 when driven by Stirling Moss. The average selling price per vehicle was \u00a3141,000.\nAston Martin will start the first production trial of the crossover model DBX, its first sports utility vehicle, at its new St Athan factory in south Wales between April and June, with full production starting early next year.\nThe site will also be the centre for battery electric vehicle production and the home of the Lagonda and the Rapide E \u2013 Aston Martin\u2019s first all-electric production car \u2013 which is on track to start production this year.",

The group, discovered by YouTuber Matt Watson, would post comments on videos of young girls doing exercises, dancing, or performing gymnastics, often adding details such as the time stamps at which underwear was visible.\nYouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm was even co-opted by the group: after a viewer watched enough videos favoured by the ring\u2019s members, the algorithm would automatically start to recommend other videos featuring young children.\n\u201cPaedophiles are trading social media contacts; they\u2019re trading links to actual child porn in YouTube comments; they\u2019re trading unlisted videos in secret, and YouTube\u2019s algorithm through some glitch in its programming is facilitating their ability to do this,\u201d Watson said at the time.\nThe discovery prompted an advertiser boycott of the platform, as companies including Fortnite-maker Epic Games and Nestl\u00e9 pulled their ads from the site.\nYouTube hopes that it will be able to stop any further harm by largely ending the possibility of commenting on all videos of young children, except for a few approved accounts.\n\u201cWe recognise that comments are a core part of the YouTube experience and how you connect with and grow your audience,\u201d said YouTube in a blogpost addressing affected creators. \u201cAt the same time, the important steps we\u2019re sharing today are critical for keeping young people safe. Thank you for your understanding and feedback as we continue our work to protect the YouTube community.\u201d\nYouTube has also taken action on a second, unrelated, child protection concern, banning a number of accounts that \u201cattempted to endanger children\u201d by splicing shocking content intended for adults in with cartoons and other content intended for children.\nOne such edit featured a YouTuber named Filthy Frank, who had produced an originally satirical clip \u201cadvising\u201d children on how to kill themselves. That scene, edited into a children\u2019s cartoon, ended up not only being seen by children but even made it past the automated filters on to YouTube\u2019s own YouTube Kids channel.",

Gasfields were first found in waters off Cyprus in 2011 but \u201cBlock 10,\u201d the area assigned to the two companies, is believed to be by far the most promising.\nThe US energy giant\u2019s British vice-president, Tony Asprey, who spoke of the discovery after informing president Nicos Anastasiades, said the company would spend the coming months pursuing further analysis of the findings to assess their full potential.\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by the results we have seen in the well and we\u2019ll be spending the next several months analysing all the data that we have gathered [to] better define the full commercial potential of the resource,\u201d he also told the news conference.\nBut Cyprus\u2019 newfound place on the regional energy map is not without risk. Political analysts said the offshore wealth could reignite tensions with Turkey, which has taken an increasingly aggressive stance over international oil companies drilling in seas whose ownership it contests.\nAnkara has warned it will soon begin its own drilling off the island, divided between a majority Greek population in the south and Turks in the breakaway north since the 1974 Turkish invasion.\nTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has repeatedly warned the five foreign energy firms currently exploring off Cyprus not to \u201coverstep the mark,\u201d arguing that some of its surrounding waters fall within the country\u2019s own jurisdiction.\nWith talks aimed at reunifying the island at an impasse, revenues from potential reserves remain a major sticking point, with Ankara insisting the subsea riches can only be shared between the two communities once a comprehensive settlement is reached.\nBlock 10 is adjacent to the huge Zohr gasfield discovered by Egypt in 2015, prompting speculation that the Mediterranean island is floating on massive natural resources.\nDetermined to pursue exploration, Anastasiades\u2019 government has said it hopes to begin exporting gas \u2013 and possibly even oil deposits believed to lie beneath it \u2013 by 2022.",

Poverty and material deprivation are known to be detrimental to brain and physical development in early childhood, and the negative effects track into adulthood. Austerity is responsible for both an increase in child poverty and material disadvantage, and a reduction in services which help to mitigate the worst effects.

The answer, however, is not to blame the producers of Green Book, or any of the other titles which picked up Oscars for failing to have done this. Nor can it be acceptable to imply there should be arbitrary restrictions on which subjects or periods artists can select. As always the remedy for anyone sharing Harker\u2019s frustration is to translate it into a script and screenplay that is sufficiently compelling to attract an audience and a backer.\nHis implying that the Green Book audience will leave with a \u201cnice warm feeling\u201d of racism having been eradicated goes beyond contentious. Who is this gullible homogeneous mass? Blanket dismissal is to be deprecated in all circumstances.\nAnd how is the film a \u201cnostalgic tale\u201d? Engaging though the two main players are, it\u2019s absurd to accuse the film-makers of setting out to stimulate a yearning for a former era.\nHarker seems to wonder why Mahershala Ali didn\u2019t win the best actor Oscar.

However, we should not feel superior to the US with regard to the UK\u2019s attitude to historical racism. The TV adaptation of Andrea Levy\u2019s novel The Long Song won unanimous and enthusiastic praise for its portrayal of slavery in the Caribbean. I found the cutesy, humorous Tom Jones-type chapter headings and comic theme tune that punctuated the piece offensive in the extreme.

Nearly four months after she said the pressure began, she was removed from her job as the country\u2019s top prosecutor \u2013 and instead was named minister of veterans affairs. She has repeatedly said she will run again in the federal election as a Liberal party candidate, a move experts view as difficult given her public spat with the prime minister.\nHer characterization of Trudeau\u2019s conduct \u2013 and of his aides\u2019 behaviour \u2013 is particularly troubling for the Trudeau administration, given the recent controversy over the detention of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Trudeau had repeatedly said that Canada\u2019s justice system is immune from political interference amid calls by the Chinese for her release.\nOn Thursday, Trudeau reaffirmed his belief that all discussions over the matter were proper.\n\u201cI totally disagree with the former attorney general\u2019s characterization [of discussions] in her testimony,\u201d said Trudeau. He denied Wilson-Raybould was removed as attorney general for her refusal to back down.\nPolitical rivals jumped on Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer of the Conservative party said Trudeau had \u201clost the moral authority to govern\u201d and called for his resignation. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic party, said the prime minister was not on the side of Canadians but stopped short of calling for his resignation.\nThe scandal first began 7 February, after the Globe and Mail reported the prime minister\u2019s office had improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould to abandon the prosecution of a large engineering company, SNC Lavalin, for fraud and bribery.\nThe Quebec engineering giant SNC Lavalin, which paid C$48m (US$36.5m) in bribes to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s regime in Libya between 2001 to 2011, is lobbying for a remedy known as a deferred prosecution agreement instead of a trial and criminal prosecution. But federal prosecutors are uninterested in pursuing an agreement \u2013 a reality Trudeau\u2019s inner circle had struggled to change.\nWilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony marked the first instance in which the prime minister was directly implicated in efforts to dissuade her from pursuing prosecution.\n\u201cAre you politically interfering with my role as attorney general? I would strongly advise against it,\u201d Wilson-Raybould recalled telling the prime minister, after he reminded her he was a member of parliament from Quebec \u2013 and asked her to \u201chelp out\u201d in the case.\n\u201cNo, no, no, we just need to find a solution,\u201d she said was the prime minister\u2019s answer.\nOn 12 February, Wilson-Raybould resigned. The country\u2019s ethics commissioner is currently investigating the accusations.\nDrawing on text messages and contemporaneous memos, she described 10 meeting and 10 telephone calls over the issue, which began in mid September of 218. Wilson-Raybould also testified about the extent of the pressure she faced, including aides promising a flurry of positive op-eds in Canadian papers to provide her political cover if she backed down. The efforts\u2013and threats to undermine her position evoked \u201cthoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre\u201d, the infamous resignations of high-ranking US justice department officials during the Watergate investigations.\nWhile the scandal has damaged the prime minister\u2019s image of transparency and openness, damage appears to be minimal in Quebec, where support for SNC Lavalin is strong, given the 3,400 people it employs in the province.\nWilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony marked the first time she has spoken at length about the pressure on her office. Questions still remain about the content of her discussions with the prime minister, which are protected by solicitor-client privilege.",

We\u2019re told that an enormous upheaval was created by Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark threatening to resign from the cabinet unless Theresa May removed the threat of a no-deal outcome.\nBut when the SNP introduced an amendment to reject no-deal in all circumstances, all three of them voted against it. So did Tobias Ellwood, Nick Boles and Oliver Letwin. Dominic Grieve apparently abstained. And Justine Greening. Of Conservatives, only Ken Clarke voted with the SNP.

The real challenge, however, is not to convince the public, who, if opinion polls are to be believed, have moved in favour of remain, but to get to the point where there is a vote. The major hurdle now is to convince enough MPs to support a people\u2019s vote.\nStrange, since it\u2019s generally agreed that, in normal circumstances, there would be a substantial pro-remain majority in the House of Commons.

They are worried about freedom of movement, there are a lot of concerns about whether they\u2019ll be able to stay and work in the UK,\u201d said Pott.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we sparked this \u2013 but if they are thinking of leaving, why not come here?\u201d\nThe Royal College of Nursing said it was concerned about a chronic shortage of nurses in the UK \u2013 there are more than 41,000 nursing vacancies in England alone and staff surveys suggest a rise in nurses working overtime since the EU referendum in 2016.\nSince the referendum, more than 10,000 nurses and midwives from the European Economic Area have left the UK workforce.\nThe University Hospital of D\u00fcsseldorf has already received a handful of applications off the back of the adverts, and expects to receive many more. Pott said he hoped the good working conditions in Germany, its proximity to Poland and its reputation for nursing will be enough to convince Poles working in the UK to take the leap.\nThe advert, published in German and Polish, says: \u201cNot only do we have better pay, better social benefits and better working hours \u2026 We also have better weather, better food and a shorter way to Poland. And the security of an EU state.\u201d\nPott said the hospital planned to offer Polish nurses a resettlement programme, which would include travelling to meet them in the UK, helping them find accommodation in Germany and introducing them to the Rhineland carnival.\nArtur Kieruzal, who works for Cooltura magazine, where one of the adverts was placed, said it had also received interested emails from the Polish community: \u201cThere was quite a big interest for many nationals from the EU who live in the UK. They have said that after Brexit, the environment won\u2019t be good for us any more \u2013 why not leave and go elsewhere in Europe?\u201d\nKieruzal said he was worried about that prospect, because it would break the Polish community apart, saying: \u201cIt will be a knife in our neck.\u201d\nHe said that on Polish Radio London, where he hosts a programme, there was constant discussion about the terms of Brexit: \u201cOf course there\u2019s a fear. When we speak with our listeners on the radio there\u2019s a lot of concerns about the future and the option to go back after Brexit is open.\n\u201cI am secretly hoping Brexit won\u2019t happen.

        "content": "The US president boasts of being a deal maker. But his summit with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi has ended in failure and recrimination\nOnly a year ago, many feared that Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Kim Jong-un might end with a bang. Then came the Singapore summit. Mr Trump boasted that they \u201cfell in love\u201d and that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat. The bromance did not look sustainable. Now a follow-up in Hanoi has ended in a whimper, collapsing without the heralded signing of at least a limited deal.\nNorth Korea needs an easing of sanctions and wants to pursue economic development; Mr Trump wants a diplomatic triumph with his name emblazoned on it. But these powerful drivers are not enough to bridge the gulf between the sides. While North Korea speaks of denuclearisation on the peninsula, it has no intention of unilateral disarmament \u2013 as US intelligence officials note. Gestures such as halting missile tests have some value, in real terms as well as in building the relationship, and disabling the Yongbyon nuclear plant would have more; the question is how much they are worth. Many had feared Mr Trump might pay too highly, as he did in Singapore.\nHours before their talks in Hanoi, he predicted a \u201cfantastic success\u201d in their long-term dealings. His hunger for a personal triumph was spurred by the excoriating testimony from his former lawyer Michael Cohen back home. When it all went wrong, he said the US had walked because Mr Kim wanted all sanctions lifted \u2013 a huge step, not in his gift. North Korea insists it sought only partial (though substantial) sanction relief. It had also made it clear prior to talks that it wanted to see sanctions lifted before it put Yongbyon out of action. The reported sidelining of Steve Biegun, the US special representative, cannot have helped \u2013 but may have been effect as much as cause. Many already suspected John Bolton was key to the talks\u2019 collapse.\nThe question is where they go from here. In his post-summit press conference Mr Trump boasted of progress, described their dealings as \u201cvery friendly\u201d, and even exculpated Mr Kim over the treatment of Otto Warmbier, the US student who died after being held in North Korea for 17 months. North Korea struck a harsher tone, saying Mr Kim \u201cgot the feeling that he didn\u2019t understand the way Americans calculate\u201d and may have \u201clost the will\u201d for further talks.\nThe risks of another summit are now much greater for both sides, and its appeal diminished. Mr Kim has already been boosted at home and abroad by two presidential meetings. His train home runs through China, and it now seems even likelier that he will stop off in Beijing. Mr Trump\u2019s warm embrace pushed China into hugging the North close, despite its previous distaste for Mr Kim. South Korea got talks back on track after Washington and Pyongyang hit problems before. But it will find it harder going this time, and until those relationships improve, it cannot get much further with the inter-Korean economic initiatives it wants to pursue.\nIt may be that talks simply peter out, with the US essentially returning to Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cstrategic patience\u201d. It was a poor idea the first time round, and Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programme is now much further advanced. But the fractious response North Korea gave last night suggests that worse outcomes are possible. Yes, the world is safer than when Mr Trump and Mr Kim were trading insults. But Mr Trump\u2019s vanity diplomacy has strengthened the North Korean leader. A humbler, more careful and more pragmatic approach, seeking to freeze rather than eradicate the weapons programme, would have been a far wiser course.",

He admitted that he wore blackface on a different occasion, while impersonating Michael Jackson. Northam has refused to resign despite calls from the state\u2019s top Democrats.\n\u201cThe governor and Mrs Northam have asked the residents of the commonwealth to forgive them for their racially insensitive past actions,\u201d wrote Walker, who is also the head of the Office of Equity and Community Engagement at the state education department.\n\u201cBut the actions of Mrs Northam, just last week, do not lead me to believe that this governor\u2019s office has taken seriously the harm and hurt they have caused African Americans in Virginia or that they are deserving of our forgiveness.\u201d\nPam Northam gave a tour of the executive mansion this month to students who had served as pages for the state senate.\nThe governor\u2019s office told the Post she did not single out black students, but simply handed it to young people who were nearby and wanted them to feel the sharpness of the plant in order to better understand how painful it would be to pick all day.\n\u201cI regret that I have upset anyone,\u201d Pam Northam said in a statement to Wavy.\nShe said she had worked to tell the full story of the mansion\u2019s history by including a visit to its historic kitchen and telling visitors about the slaves who worked at the site, and would consult historians about the most appropriate way to convey those experiences to visitors in the future.\n\u201cI believe it does a disservice to Virginians to omit the stories of the enslaved people who lived and worked there \u2013 that\u2019s why I have been engaged in an effort to thoughtfully and honestly share this important story since I arrived in Richmond,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI have provided the same educational tour to executive mansion visitors over the last few months and used a variety of artifacts and agricultural crops with the intention of illustrating a painful period of Virginia history.\u201d\nIn a letter to Northam posted by the news station, the eighth-grader said she and the other page who was handed cotton were two of only three African Americans in the class.\n\u201cThe comments and just the way you carried yourself during this time was beyond inappropriate, especially considering recent events with the governor,\u201d she wrote.",

But it is a very close thing.\u201d\nThe ERG has agreed that a group of eight lawyers, seven of them MPs, will scrutinise and pass judgment on the final compromise offered by Geoffrey Cox. Significantly, among them is the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, whose opinion carries huge weight with Eurosceptic Conservatives on whether to back the prime minister\u2019s deal.\nOthers in the group are the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, and former Department for Exiting the European Union ministers David Jones and Suella Braverman, the veteran Brexiter Bill Cash, and the backbenchers Michael Tomlinson and Robert Courts. The seven MPs will be joined by Martin Howe QC, chair of the pro-leave group Lawyers for Britain.\nNumber 10 sources suggested it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d any deal would be ready to be brought back to the House of Commons next week, meaning MPs are near certain to vote closer to the deadline of 12 March.\nEurosceptic sources said they did not believe a flood of ministerial resignations would follow from Eustice\u2019s departure. The MP, a long-standing Brexiter and former Ukip candidate, said he wanted to be free to participate in debates in parliament in the coming weeks.\nIn his letter to May, Eustice said he had resigned with \u201ctremendous sadness\u201d and he would vote for May\u2019s withdrawal agreement but said he felt he had \u201cstuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats\u201d.\nEustice said he felt the prime minister had been \u201cterribly undermined\u201d by ministers and MPs who did not want to see the referendum result be carried out.\n\u201cI fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,\u201d he said.\nAlthough he said the prime minister had shown \u201ctenacity and resilience\u201d, he suggested both the prime minister and parliament had lost their nerve. \u201cWhat our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it,\u201d he said.\nEustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth, also criticised the conduct of the Brussels negotiators. \u201cI do not believe that the [European] commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave.\n\u201cIf the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.\u201d\nEustice said that MPs should be prepared to vote to leave with no deal and \u201chave the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards\u201d.\nMay spoke briefly by telephone with Eustice before his resignation. In her letter to the former minister after is resignation, May called him \u201can outstanding champion for the UK\u2019s farming and fishing communities\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cI agree with you that parliament must now come together and honour the referendum result by voting for a deal which will give businesses and citizens the certainty they need and deserve.\u201d\nA former farmer who has been a popular figure in the industry, Eustice stood for Ukip in 1999 and worked on the \u201cno\u201d campaign against the euro. He then worked for the Conservative party under Michael Howard, eventually becoming press secretary to David Cameron when he was leader of the opposition.",

It is not clear if that process will begin before the election on 9 April but it will likely take many months.\nHowever, the weight of announcement throws serious doubt over his political future.\nHe has denied all accusations, dismissing them as part of a witch-hunt orchestrated by the press. Speaking on Thursday evening, Netanyahu said in a televised statement that \u201cthis entire house of cards will collapse\u201d.\nThe country\u2019s second-longest serving premier who runs the most right-wing government in its history, Netanyahu has previously pledged not to resign if indicted. He would be under no legal obligation to do so.\nHe warned the legal case against him was a political ploy by leftist opponents \u201cjust to topple the right wing and raise the left to the premiership. There is no other explanation.\u201d\nNetanyahu went on to say that the accusations were lies and a \u201cblood libel\u201d.\nFearing the impact on the upcoming vote, the prime minister\u2019s right-wing Likud party petitioned the high court on Thursday in last-minute attempt to block the announcement, but it was rejected.\nThe party later described the charges as \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d.\n\u201cUnilateral publication of the attorney general\u2019s announcement just a month before the elections, without giving the prime minister an opportunity to refute these false accusations, is a blatant and unprecedented intervention in the elections,\u201d Likud said in a statement.\nDuring two years of intense deliberations and questionings, police have already recommended that Netanyahu, be indicted in all three cases.\nHe could face up to 10 years in jail if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.\nCase 1,000 involves allegations of receiving gifts, including expensive cigars, pink champagne and jewellery, from international billionaires allegedly in exchange for favours. In Case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country\u2019s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.\nThe third and most serious case, 4,000, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecom provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\nIt would be the first time that a sitting prime minister has been charged. A poll by the Times of Israel found that the decision could lose Netanyahu four seats in the election and scupper his chances of forming a coalition government.\nThe poll indicated the newly formed Blue and White party, run by retired army chief Benny Gantz, could see a major jump in its Knesset seats, placing it in a strong position to form a coalition.\nFurther hurting Netanyahu\u2019s run for reelection, several key allies of the prime minister have said they will not support him if the attorney general goes forward with an indictment.\nNetanyahu rushed back on Wednesday from a trip to Moscow where he met with President Vladimir Putin to prepare for the possible fallout.\nHours ahead of the announcement, the embattled Israeli leader received support from his ally, the US president Donald Trump.\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s been a great prime minister and I don\u2019t know about his difficulty,\u201d he said in response to a question in Hanoi.\n\u201cI can say this, that he\u2019s done a great job as prime minister. He\u2019s tough, he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s strong,\u201d Trump said.\nSeparately, Sara Netanyahu was charged last year with fraud and breach of trust for allegedly overspending roughly $100,000 (\u00a378,000) on private meals at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, even though there was a full-time chef on staff. She denies the accusations, and the case is ongoing.",

Some may consider splitting up to try to avoid the loss.\nThe change, which was slipped out in January on the evening of a Brexit vote, was condemned by charities as a stealth cut which would drive up pensioner poverty, although at the time there were no details of how many people would be affected.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) revealed in an analysis published on Thursday that the rule change will affect 15,000 couples this year, rising to 60,000 in 2023-24. Estimated savings will be \u00a345m this year, rising to \u00a3385m by 2023-24, amounting to cumulative savings of \u00a31.1bn.\nAs well as moving pensioners on to universal credit, a working-age benefit designed to incentivise work, the move means that affected mixed-age couples in social homes are likely to be be subject to the bedroom tax \u2013 a \u00a315 a week average loss in rent support from which pensioners were previously exempt.\nTom Selby, senior analyst at financial services firm AJ Bell, said: \u201cTens of thousands of mixed-age couples are facing a \u00a31bn hit as a result of the government\u2019s pension credit raid. With pension credit worth up to \u00a313,273 a year, versus \u00a35,986 a year for universal credit, at the extreme those affected could be over \u00a37,000 a year worse off.\u201d\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u201cThis change was voted on by parliament in 2012 and means, for new claims from 15 May, only pensioners can claim pension credit. If a person in the household is of working age we believe it\u2019s fair that they should be in the same circumstances as other people of the same age, regardless of the age of their partner.\u201d\n This article was amended on 1 March 2019. An earlier version referred to the bedroom tax and gave a figure of \u00a314 a week for the average loss in rent support. The up to date figure is \u00a315.",

It does seem to me that this might end up with the Gambling Commission.\u201d\nIn an apparent reference to internal divisions in the Labour party and the decision by several of its MPs to form a breakaway group, Watson added: \u201cI can be an obsessive gamer, usually at times of crisis, so I\u2019ve been playing a lot lately.\u201d\nSkins are in-game items, such as weapons or outfits, that can be won and traded for money, while loot boxes invite players to pay a certain amount for a mystery reward whose value can be small or relatively large.\nCritics said the element of chance, coupled with the ability to spend real money, means children are being exposed to products that are essentially gambling by another name.\nThe Gambling Commission has no special responsibility for regulation of skins and loot boxes but can intervene if it believes the way they are sold or marketed is covered by the Gambling Act.\nA spokesman said the regulator was concerned by the the increasing number of examples where the line between video games and gambling has become blurred.\n\u201cWhere we are clear that a product has passed the line into gambling and is posing a risk to players, we will take action,\u201d the Commission said. It pointed to a 2017 prosecution against FutGalaxy for providing skins gambling to the underage.\n\u201cWe have joined forces with other regulators to call on video games companies to address the clear public concern around the risks gambling and some video games can pose to children.\n\u201cWe encourage video games companies to work with their gambling regulators and take action now to address those concerns to make sure that consumers, and particularly children, are protected.\u201d\nWhere in-game items that are derived from loot boxes can be readily exchanged for cash, the loot boxes themselves are likely to fall within the definition of gambling, according to the Commission.\nA spokesman for the department for digital, culture, media and sport, said: \u201cThe Gambling Commission has shown it will take action and prosecute unlicensed gambling that features in-game items, becoming the first regulator in the world to do so.\n\u201cThe commission is also working with the video games industry to raise awareness of this issue. We will continue to look closely at the evidence and associated risks.\u201d",

Overall, catches of commercially important fish have fallen by just over 4%, but in some regions catches have plunged by about a third since early in the last century.\nThe findings come from a study that has used \u201chindcasting\u201d methods to reconstruct the effects of global warming, overfishing and other impacts on fisheries over the 80-year period from 1930 to 2010.\nThe researchers, whose work is published in the journal Science, examined fish populations in 38 regions, studying 235 fish populations made up of 124 species, which represented about a third of the global fishing catch over the period studied. Changes in temperature were found to have an important effect, along with other problems such as overfishing and ocean acidification.\nThey used data on catch sizes, fish populations and temperatures to build a picture of how fishing, sea temperature increases and other factors had an effect on fish populations over the period studied.\nChristopher Free, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who led the research, said the overall picture was one of losses to fish populations, even though some species, such as black sea bass in the Atlantic, showed gains as sea temperatures rose. Olaf Jensen, associate professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey and a co-author, warned that species that had benefited from warming were \u201clikely to start declining as temperatures continue to rise\u201d.\nThe greatest losses found in the study were of fish in the North Sea near the UK, the sea of Japan, around the Iberian coast and the Celtic-Biscay shelf. There were gains among fish populations in the Labrador-Newfoundland region, the Baltic Sea, the Indian Ocean and the north-east US shelf. Historical data on many tropical regions is limited, leaving the researchers unable to form a clear picture in such areas.",

The statements were originally issued to Serious Fraud Office investigators in 2014.\nThe court heard that Varley, who served as chief executive until 2010, had \u201cglobal ambitions for Barclays\u201d that meant expanding foreign ownership and increasing the bank\u2019s non-UK income to 75% of the total.\nAfter striking a relationship with the China Development Bank in 2007, Varley said he \u201cwas interested in developing a similar relationship with the Qataris, building on that example of how to develop a valuable collaboration\u201d.\nVarley acknowledged that the Qataris had a \u201creputation of being tough negotiators\u201d. But he believed that the value of the ensuing services agreement, which resulted in millions being paid to the Gulf state, \u201cover time would far exceed the fees payable\u201d.\nHe added that Qatar\u2019s subsequent investment in Barclays and the advisory services agreement were \u201cdistinct\u201d. \u201cI did not regard the fees payable as connected to the capital raising from a regulatory perspective,\u201d the statement read.\nThe Serious Fraud Office alleges that four former Barclays executives \u2013 Richard Boath, Varley, Roger Jenkins and Tom Kalaris \u2013 lied to the stock market and other investors about how \u00a3322m in fees were paid to Qatar in relation to emergency fundraising of more than \u00a311bn in 2008.\nProsecutors say the executives put together two advisory services agreements (ASAs) in order to disguise Qatar\u2019s demand for larger commission payments.\nAll four men have denied the charges.\nVarley said he was not involved in day-to-day negotiations with the bank\u2019s Qatari investors. \u201cI was kept informed of the development on the capital raising during that period and I was aware that the deal team led by Roger Jenkins was having tough negotiations with the Qataris.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cno legal obstacles\u201d were flagged up to him, particularly in October 2008, when he understood \u201cthere had been robust negotiations by Roger and his team\u201d.\nOnly two witnesses have given live evidence during the landmark trial, and Judge Mr Justice Jay confirmed on Thursday that the prosecution would not call further witnesses.\nThe trial continues.",

        "content": "Musician, who won four Oscars and conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, blurred musical boundaries\nThe conductor and composer Andr\u00e9 Previn has died at the age of 89. The German-born musician was an extraordinary and versatile talent who blurred the boundaries between jazz, pop, film and classical music.\nFor many Britons, however, he will always be best known as \u201cAndrew Preview\u201d for his appearance on 1971\u2019s Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special, which featured him conducting Eric Morecambe as an inept soloist in Grieg\u2019s Piano Concerto.\nPrevin was born in Berlin in 1929, but his family fled Nazi Germany for the US, and he became an American citizen in 1943. He grew up in Los Angeles and, while still in his teens, started writing film scores and working as a jazz pianist, appearing with Ella Fitzgerald, among others. During military service in the early 50s, he took conducting lessons with Pierre Monteux, and, at the age of 32, abandoned Hollywood to concentrate on a classical career. \u201cAt MGM, you knew you were going to be working next year, you knew you were going to get paid. But I was too ambitious musically to settle for it. And I wanted to gamble with whatever talent I might have had,\u201d he told a Guardian interviewer in 2008.\nIn 1967, Previn succeeded Sir John Barbirolli as music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. The following year he was appointed principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 11 years.\nDuring his time in London, he did much to broaden the orchestra\u2019s reach with regular television appearances including the BBC\u2019s weekly Andr\u00e9 Previn\u2019s Music Night, which ran weekly in a primetime slot on Saturday evenings during the early- to mid-70s. More people watched the LSO on Music Night in one week than in 65 years of concerts, and he and the orchestra made an average of 14 albums a year.\nHis close relationship with the orchestra continued throughout his life. He was made conductor laureate in 1992 and conductor emeritus in 2016, and last conducted them in London in 2015.\nAndrew Marriner, LSO\u2019s principal clarinet and lifelong friend, said today: \u201cAndr\u00e9\u2019s music-making thrilled me long before I was lucky enough to play with him, but when I did, it was the extraordinary sound he conjured from an orchestra, unmistakably his own, that dazzled. In Strauss, Walton, Rachmaninov and so much more, he drew the players into a deeply moving collaboration. His touch on the piano in Mozart concertos and in chamber music was divine, his compositions fabulously crafted. Never one to suffer fools, his wicked sense of humour could be sharp, always hilarious.\u201d\nFrom 1976-84, Previn was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and between 1985-88, principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. A spell as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the late 80s was cut short when he resigned following a disagreement over the appointment of his successor. In recent years, he was music director of the Oslo Philharmonic (2002 to 2006), and in 2009 was appointed Principal Guest Conductor of Tokyo\u2019s NHK Symphony Orchestra.\nHis first opera, A Streetcar Named Desire was premiered at San Francisco Opera in 1998 with Ren\u00e9e Fleming as Blanche DuBois, and he also wrote as musicals, orchestral and chamber works and several concertos, and he continued to work in Hollywood throughout his life as a score writer and arranger. He was nominated 11 times for an Oscar, winning four \u2013 for best scoring of a musical for Lerner and Loewe\u2019s Gigi and Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess, and best score (adaptation or treatment) for the Billy Wilder comedy Irma la Douce, and then for George Cukor\u2019s blockbuster version of Lerner and Loewe\u2019s My Fair Lady. He also wrote song music for Paint Your Wagon, a film based on another Lerner and Loewe musical.\nSee you in the Morning beloved Friend. May you rest in glorious symphonies pic.twitter.com/r546GFcsyV\nHis personal life \u2013 he married five times \u2013 also made him a public figure. One of his marriages was to actress and activist Mia Farrow, with whom he had three biological children. They also adopted three others, including Soon-Yi, who went on to marry Woody Allen, Farrow\u2019s partner after her break-up with Previn. His fifth marriage, to violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, for whom he had composed a violin concerto, lasted only four years, but the two remained close.\nHe was asked in an 80th-birthday interview whether he had any regrets. \u201cPrivately, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made some very poor choices in my private life. But, as a professional, no, not really.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he added, \u201ctend to take myself all that seriously.\u201d",

It follows leading handler Ralph Beckett\u2019s decision to email 500 fellow trainers proposing the boycott of ARC racecourses from Wednesday to Friday in an argument over prize money.\nThe support for Beckett\u2019s call came despite an attempt by ARC on Thursday to avert a threatened strike by \u2018unlocking\u2019 extra prize money until 31 March to allow time for talks with trainers and owners.\nThe continuing protest aimed at a cut of nearly \u00a33m in the prize money at ARC tracks in 2019 has already resulted last weekend in one \u2018walkover\u2019, a \u2018race\u2019 featuring one horse, and one race with no entries at all on Lingfield\u2019s high-profile Winter Derby card.\nARC announced the cut in prize money before Christmas, claiming that it expects a sharp fall in its media rights income following the government\u2019s decision to cut the maximum stake on betting-shop gaming machines to \u00a32 from 1 April.\nWhile the company has not committed any fresh funding to prizes, a deal brokered by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) on Thursday means it will shift around \u00a3235,000 from better-quality events to races at the lower end of the scale, thereby \u2018unlocking\u2019 additional funding from the Levy Board. BHA chief executive Nick Rust had said in the wake of the meeting: \u201cI\u2019m pleased at the commitment from all to work together on this, which has to be in the long-term interests of the sport.\n\u201cWe know there are difficult times ahead, and a common approach is the best way to respond. I believe we can achieve that over the next four weeks if we can maintain the spirit of the agreement we\u2019re announcing today.\u201d\nWe cannot as an industry put up with the scandalous returns 2 owners from the ARC courses, it is time to stand up and say this is not a fair return for them or trainers & staff that work so hard 2 put the show on the road, if they dont fund them better maybe they should lose them\nWith media rights income expected to fall as a result of fewer shops, more talks are planned between the BHA, the Racecourse Association, the NTF, racecourses and the Horsemen\u2019s Group to try to find a solution to the funding issue.\nThe various parties agreed \u201cunilateral action\u201d was not in the best interests of the sport at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, although that appears to have been ignored by trainers.\nThe total number of runners on a Flat card at Lingfield has dipped below 30 only once in the last decade, on 1 February this year, when seven non-runners reduced an initial total of 36 declared runners to just 29 starters.\nEntries are also due on Friday for next Thursday\u2019s all-weather card at Southwell, another ARC-owned course which Beckett suggested should be the target for a boycott.\nNewbury\u00a01.45 Crystal Lad 2.20 Christopher Wood\u00a02.50 Awake At Midnight 3.25 Emitom\u00a03.55 Jabulani 4.30 Orchardstown Cross\u00a05.00 Glasha\u2019s Peak\u00a0\nLingfield\u00a02.00 Motajaasid (nb) 2.30 Shake Me Handy\u00a03.05 Merhoob (nap) 3.35 Attain 4.10 Zmhar 4.40 Moonlight Spirit\u00a0\nDoncaster\u00a02.10 Legal History 2.40 Coole Well 3.15 Away For Slates 3.45 It\u2019s All A Lark 4.20 The White Mouse 4.50 Suggestion 5.20 Poppy Kay\u00a0\nNewcastle\u00a05.30 Tamreer 6.00 Jai Hanuman 6.30 Epeius 7.00 Blindingly 7.30 Edgewood\u00a08.00 Intense Starlet\u00a0\nSimon Munir and Isaac Souede, whose jumps horses have already won nearly \u00a3750,000 this season, are among the owners supporting a boycott of ARC courses. Via the Twitter feed of Highflyer Bloodstock, which buys many of their runners, the owners stated on Thursday that they wanted to ensure that \u201ctheir trainers do not enter for ARC meetings next week\u201d as \u201a\u201cthey are in full support of the boycott over what is clearly a premature reduction of prize money.\u201d\nNewmarket trainer Stuart Williams was another who made his feelings clear on Twitter.\nHe wrote: \u201cWe cannot as an industry put up with the scandalous returns to owners from the ARC courses. It is time to stand up and say this is not a fair return for them or trainers and staff that work so hard to put the show on the road - if they don\u2019t fund them better, maybe they should lose them.\u201d",

        "content": "Buyers at float have been reminded why you shouldn\u2019t buy if private equity is selling\nAston Martin Lagonda has just enjoyed an \u201coutstanding\u201d year, said chief executive Andy Palmer, and the mere act of arriving on the London Stock Exchange \u201cdemonstrated our legitimacy in the global luxury market\u201d.\nTell it to the poor buyers of the shares at flotation. What Palmer didn\u2019t mention is that Aston Martin\u2019s stock has been stuck in reverse gear from the moment the flag dropped last October.\nListed at \u00a319, a price that was itself a cut from the \u00a322.50 the private equity backers had apparently sought, the shares closed on Thursday at \u00a310.80, a fall of a fifth on the day. Put another way, the buyers at float are sitting on a paper loss of 43%. They have just been reminded why, on the whole, you shouldn\u2019t buy if private equity is selling.\nPalmer is on firmer ground in arguing that Aston Martin has done roughly what it said it would do as a public company. Official profit forecasts are intact after five months, which, if you\u2019re generous, could be seen as a mini-triumph given the state of the global car industry.\nYet, for outsiders, it remains a challenge to know which needle on the dashboard to watch. The word \u201cadjusted\u201d littered the results statement, and not just because of the \u00a3136m (really) of costs related to the float. One can see that revenues improved 25% but this did not translate into better profit margins. Indeed, what the company calls \u201cnormalised adjusted diluted earnings per share\u201d went backwards, as did cashflow.\nNext year\u2019s big event is the launch of an SUV, and it may be only fair to reserve judgment until that hurdle has been cleared. The company\u2019s pitch is that can increase production from 6,441 vehicles last year to 14,000 in \u201cthe medium term\u201d as new models are developed.\nAll the same, it\u2019s alarming to see Canaccord Genuity\u2019s analysts arguing already that more capital may be required to fund this massive ramp-up in production.\nPalmer could help himself by being clearer on how it\u2019s supposed to happen, and where all these buyers of expensive cars are meant to live. Even after the slump in the share price, Aston Martin is still valued at a revved-up 39 times earnings on the company\u2019s preferred yardstick.\nShareholders can\u2019t claim they weren\u2019t warned. \u201cWe don\u2019t make cars, we make dreams,\u201d Palmer told them at float. Valuing a dream ain\u2019t easy. Adjusted normalised dreams are even trickier.\nTerrific news, eh? The Norwegians reckon the UK is a buy whatever the Brexit outcome. They want to invest more of their oil wealth here rather than flee for the fjords.\n\u201cWe foresee that over time our investments in the UK will increase,\u201d the fund\u2019s chief executive, Yngve Slyngstad, said this week. Cue relief, delight and even triumphalism among excitable Brexiters who should know better (ie Jacob Rees-Mogg).\nCalm down. The Norwegian fund\u2019s intentions are not remarkable. If you are managing $1tn (\u00a3753bn) of assets by investing globally, it would be perverse to ignore the world\u2019s fifth largest economy and Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre.\nAnd, given that Slyngstad says the fund takes a 30-year view, it would be even stranger to form firm conclusions about the effect of Brexit before the UK has left the European Union.\nThe question isn\u2019t simply: will Brexit make the UK poorer? but what\u2019s in the price? Is sterling going up, down or sideways immediately after Brexit? Until there is clarity, sticking to the current approach is merely the default position for a big, slow-moving fund.\nThe dividend yield on the FTSE 100 index is 4.48%, which is juicy by historical standards. Dumping UK plc at current prices would be bold. There are other complications. The Norwegians get a slice of UK banking by owning HSBC, but a lot more Asian exposure. So are they betting on the UK or are they investing in multinationals that happen to be listed in London? Surely the latter.\nAt the same time, we are invited to be encouraged that the Norwegians want to add to their UK property holdings, which include a slug of Regent Street. Well, yes, UK property is a large investment category that will feature on the radar of most sovereign wealth funds, but a broad plan to spend in coming decades doesn\u2019t tell us much about the Norwegian view of current valuations. Are they buyers now, or only if a no-deal Brexit clobbers valuations?\nThe mistake is to view everything though today\u2019s Brexit lens. It\u2019s not that simple. Fund managers watch events and prices. The Norwegians are being open-minded and noncommittal. It\u2019s what you\u2019d expect.",

The courts have acknowledged this case needs to be looked at again, as we have always said as a family.\n\u201cThe abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.\n\u201cAs sons, we get another shot for our story to be heard, the events that led to our father\u2019s death to be heard, and for our mother to have another shot at freedom \u2013 a freedom she has never had since the age of 15.\u201d\nChallen, of Claygate, Surrey, who was separated from her husband at the time of the crime, hit him with a hammer 20 times.\nShe admitted killing the former car dealer, but denied murder claiming diminished responsibility. Her case was that she had been subjected to abuse and intimidation by her husband, whom she met when she was 15.\nThe prosecution case was that it was the action of a jealous woman who suspected infidelity, and she was found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years, later reduced on appeal by four years.\nShe has so far served eight years of her sentence.\nQuashing her conviction on Thursday, three senior judges ruled fresh evidence given by a psychiatrist undermined the safety of her conviction.\nChallen, who attended the appeal over a video link from HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, burst into tears as she heard the result and there were cheers and applause from relatives and supporters in the public gallery.\nChallen will now face a retrial on a charge of murder.\nLady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice Sweeney and Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, said: \u201cThe court of appeal heard that, in the opinion of a consultant forensic psychiatrist, the appellant was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing.\n\u201cThis evidence was not available at the time of the trial and the court quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial.\u201d\nAt a press conference, one of Challen\u2019s lawyer, Harriet Wistrich, said: \u201cWhatever may be the ultimate outcome, we have managed to raise awareness and a much deeper understanding of the concept of coercive control, which is such a recent one.\u201d\nWistrich said she had spoken to Challen immediately after the hearing. \u201cIt has not sunk in yet. She was obviously delighted that the appeal was won, but daunted by the prospect of what\u2019s to come.\u201d\nShe said this time the case would be \u201carmed with great deal more concerning the context of how Sally came to act\u201d. She had been portrayed as a jealous wife in her first trial, she said, adding: \u201cI think that picture is now turned on its head because of our understanding of coercive control.\u201d\nThe case was also supported by Challen\u2019s other son, James Challen, and the campaign group Justice for Women, which had run a high-profile campaign ahead of the appeal.\nChallen\u2019s legal team is expected to pursue a bail bid at a future crown court hearing.\nThe court ordered Challen will have to have the fresh murder charge put to her within two months.",

It has been pored over by art history experts and scientifically analysed and a highly convincing case has been made that it is from around 1607 and by Caravaggio.\nBut it is a compelling case rather than a categorical one and that presents a dilemma. \u201cThe poor buyer of this picture will not enjoy it,\u201d said Eric Turquin, a Paris-based expert in the Old Masters. \u201cHe will have to have a special mailbox for all the emails.\u201d\nTurquin was in London, accompanied by the painting, to make the case for it being a genuine Caravaggio as it went on display in London.\nIt was discovered by the auctioneer Marc Labarbe in 2014 during a clearout of an attic in a large house in Toulouse. The painting was kept a secret for two years, with Turquin hanging it in his bedroom despite whom he described as \u201cmy poor wife\u201d.\nIn 2016 the French government placed an export ban on the painting to allow investigations and time for the Louvre to consider whether it should be bought. The museum decided not to buy it but Turquin said that did not mean the work was not a Caravaggio. He said the price of \u20ac100m represented 15 years of the Louvre\u2019s acquisition budget in one go, and the museum already had three exceptional Caravaggios.\nThe Louvre decision opens the door for its auction on 27 June in Toulouse. It has an estimate of \u00a390m to \u00a3140m.\nTurquin said it would be sold. \u201cIt will be an auction without reserve. It will be a real sale, no guarantees, no nothing, a real auction. We have had a lot of interest in the painting and who knows what this painting is worth.\u201d\nThere are 68 known paintings by Caravaggio, only four of which are in private hands. Turquin said it was \u201cnot a picture for a drawing room or a dining room\u201d, and suggested that a museum would be the likely buyer.\nThe painting depicts the biblical story of Judith, a young widow in the city of Bethulia who puts an end to the Assyrian siege on her city by seducing and beheading the general Holofernes. Looking on is her elderly and clearly ill servant, Abra.\nLabarbe said burglars broke into the house where it was found several years earlier but left the painting, believing it worthless.\nThere are gaps in the story of the painting but Turquin said a good reason for that was because \u201cCaravaggio as an artist was totally out of fashion from 1650 to 1950. His paintings were worth nothing, nobody was looking for them.\u201d\nHe pointed to the last Caravaggio auction in 1971 when Christie\u2019s put up for sale Martha and Mary Magdalene, which had been discovered in South America. Turquin said the then head of the National Gallery, Michael Levey, did not believe it was a Caravaggio and it failed to sell. Soon after it was bought privately for the Detroit Institute of Arts. \u201cToday there is not one Caravaggio show without a letter sent to Detroit,\u201d said Turquin.\nThe Judith beheading Holofornes painting will go on display at the Colnaghi gallery in Mayfair, London, between 1 and 9 March.",

Ceon\u2019s life sentence is knowing he didn\u2019t help Louella to live.\u201d\nMichie had confronted Broughton \u2013 who denied the charges and declined to give evidence \u2013 towards the end of the trial in the court waiting area, calling him \u201cevil\u201d.\nFletcher-Michie\u2019s sister Daisy also told him: \u201cAll we wanted from you was an apology.\u201d Broughton lost his temper, throwing a wooden table against a wall, before damaging a water cooler. He had to be restrained by police, security staff and his legal team.\nProsecutors argued during the trial that Broughton, from Enfield, north London, failed to take reasonable steps to seek medical help for his girlfriend.\nProsecutor William Mousley QC said Broughton had given the drugs to her and he had a duty of care to look after her.\nThe court also heard how Fletcher-Michie scraped thorns across her face and ate twigs after apparently having a \u201cbad trip\u201d.\nHer body was later found by a security guard at about 1am about 400 metres from the festival\u2019s hospital tent curled up in trees as if she had lain down for a sleep, the court heard.\nCraig Welsh, a security worker, told the court how he found the body after being approached by Fletcher-Michie\u2019s desperate parents who had driven 130 miles from their home in London wanting to search for their daughter.\nWelsh said: \u201cMr Michie had his mobile phone. He showed me a Google pin drop. Both parents were distressed. He wanted to gain access to the site to go searching for his daughter \u2026 I contacted the event controller and explained, but it was refused.\n\u201cBecause I suggested I knew where it was, I said if he was happy I would take his phone and go to the location. He gave me the phone.\u201d\nWelsh told the court how he and a colleague found the body in a forest area. \u201cShe was laid facing up. It was as if she was curled up,\u201d he said.\nAiden Lawrence, another security worker, said Broughton\u2019s behaviour was \u201cerratic\u201d when he did go to find help. \u201cHe kept wanting to run off,\u201d he told the court.\nA postmortem examination found the hallucinogenic class A drug 2C-P and traces of ketamine and MDMA in her system.\nFletcher-Michie had a 90% chance of survival if she had been given medical help, Prof Charles Deakin, a consultant in cardiac anaesthesia and intensive care, told the court.\nStephen Kamlish QC, defending, said Broughton did not realise his girlfriend was at risk of dying and did not want to leave her alone in the woods while she was suffering a \u201cbad trip\u201d.\nBroughton tried to help by sending text messages and their GPS position via Google Maps, he added.\nBroughton is due to be sentenced on Friday. He previously pleaded guilty to supplying 2C-P to Fletcher-Michie and another person at Glastonbury festival earlier in 2017.\nIn a statement released on behalf of Fletcher-Michie\u2019s family shortly after her death, they said: \u201cOur hearts are broken by this horrific tragedy. Louella inspired all who knew her with her joy of life.\u201d",

        "content": "A complaint from a non-partisan group accuses David Bernhardt of weakening protections for endangered fish to favor farmers\nSeveral years before becoming acting US interior secretary, David Bernhardt was a lobbyist for one of California\u2019s largest water districts, where he sought to win more water for farmers, even if it came at the expense of imperiled fish that also needed it.\nBut despite joining the interior department in 2017, a new complaint alleges, he has continued to pursue policies that favor his old clients. According to the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, he has taken steps to weaken protections for endangered fish, such as the diminutive delta smelt, in California and make more irrigation water available for prominent agricultural interests in the state.\n\u201cIt is difficult to discern where Mr Bernhardt\u2019s private-sector lobbying activities end and where his public service begins,\u201d the CLC writes in its complaint. \u201cMr Bernhardt\u2019s participation in these particular matters appears to violate his ethics pledge and, at a minimum, violates his obligation to avoid the appearance that he is using his public office for the private gain of his former lobbying client.\u201d\nThe White House ethics pledge, which Bernhardt signed shortly after taking office, explicitly prohibits executive branch officials from participating in any particular matters or specific issue areas that they previously lobbied on for two years after the date of their appointment. In a statement to the Guardian, an interior department spokesperson said Bernhardt had committed no violations.\nThe CLC\u2019s ethics complaint comes at a tumultuous time for the Interior Department, a massive agency that oversees approximately 500m acres of public land across the country.\nIn early February, Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Bernhardt to be the next interior secretary, a position that requires Senate approval. If confirmed, Bernhardt will succeed Ryan Zinke, a former congressman from Montana who stepped down from the Interior Department amid a swirl of scandals.\nLast week, the CLC filed a separate ethics complaint with the Interior Department\u2019s inspector general asking for an investigation into six top political officials at the agency who appear to have violated their ethics pledges. The complaint was based in part on The Guardian\u2019s reporting.\nBernhard worked as a lobbyist for Westlands Water District, the largest agricultural water district in the country and a political heavyweight in the Golden State, from 2011 to November 2016. In that role, the CLC says, he lobbied or otherwise advocated for specific provisions that benefited Westlands to be included in the WIIN Act, a major law that Congress passed in late 2016 that partly governs water management in California.\nShortly after joining the Interior Department as Deputy Secretary, the complaint contends, Bernhardt would go on to direct his subordinates to begin a process that would effectively implement those same WIIN ACT provisions, again to the benefit of his former client.\nThe CLC\u2019s complaint, which is based in part on a recent New York Times report, asks the Interior Department inspector general to investigate and issue a report on the acting secretary\u2019s conduct.\nOn Wednesday, senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal also sent a letter to the department asking it to provide a range of information about Bernhardt\u2019s involvement in California water management.\n\u201cThe Interior Department has become the public arm of oil, gas, mining and other extraction industries,\u201d said Congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, the chair of the House Natural Resources committee, which conducts oversight of the Interior Department. \u201cAnd I say that without reservations.\u201d",

        "content": "Claudio Ranieri will always be remembered with affection in England \u2013 his 2016 title win with Leicester was by some distance the greatest against-the-odds triumph the Premier League has witnessed \u2013 though a manager who has made 18 exits in five countries ought to know better than most that fairytales happen only once in a lifetime.\nThere was no dilly-ding dilly-dong at Fulham, just the relegation clock ticking away in the background. The pizza-based incentives that supposedly came in handy at Leicester never really surfaced in London; with three wins in 17 games in all competitions there was barely anything solid enough to celebrate. Ranieri remains a charming man and an intelligent coach but he is not a lucky charm after all.\nFulham, it turns out, were no Leicester waiting to be whipped into shape. The failings that cost Slavisa Jokanovic his job, mostly defensive ones, stubbornly remained through his successor\u2019s tenure. The Craven Cottage roster failed to yield a Jamie Vardy or a Riyad Mahrez capable of surprising even the most alert defences and allowing Fulham to find an effective way of playing.\nLeicester were a one-off, in other words. As everyone suspected, Ranieri was unable to bring the magic with him in his well-travelled suitcase, because he was unable to repeat the trick with them after the miracle season, even with the same set of players. Quite why Shahid Khan described him as a risk-free appointment is a mystery, if only because Fulham with their present squad are not in a position to assume anything is risk-free.\nRanieri did a marvellous job of making Gary Lineker eat his words when the Match of the Day presenter and Leicester supporter went public with the admission he found the Foxes\u2019 choice of manager underwhelming, though if the Italian possessed the ability to exceed everyone\u2019s expectations he would not have had so many clubs.\nWhat Khan should probably have noticed is that relegation battles are not Ranieri\u2019s forte. He tends to do well at middle-range clubs where he can run things fairly smoothly, as long as instant success is not demanded. After a long career in management Leicester was his first title success and, though it is true the club spent the previous season fighting relegation, by the time Ranieri replaced Nigel Pearson a unique opportunity presented itself, largely thanks to the scouting ability of Steve Walsh, who brought in N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 as well as Vardy and Mahrez, and the team spirit forged since promotion to the Premier League. Ranieri did not find anything remotely similar at Fulham, where morale began low and has remained so, and the money spent on strengthening following promotion in summer appears to have had little effect.\nWhen Fulham played at Manchester United in December they were three goals down by half-time and though they tightened up Ranieri warned that if they continued to be so generous they would have no chance of survival.\nPerhaps no one expected Fulham to prosper against top-six opponents after sacking their manager three months into their first season back in the Premier League but in the last couple of months they have lost to Burnley, Crystal Palace, West Ham and Southampton, as well as going out of the FA Cup at home to Oldham.\nBad start\nHaving spent over \u00a3100m on new players, Fulham begin the season with\u00a0a 2-0 home defeat\u00a0to Crystal Palace\u00a0\nBournemouth boos\nJeers greet the final whistle as Fulham suffer a fourth heavy defeat in succession, against Bournemouth\u00a0at Craven Cottage\nJokanovic feels the heat\n\u2018I am a fantastic coach\u2019 says Slavisa Jokanovic as he comes out fighting for his job following a 1-0 loss\u00a0away to Huddersfield\nJokanovic is no more\nJokanovic is sacked soon after a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool. Claudio Ranieri is immediately confirmed as the Serb\u2019s successor\nNew manager bounce\nRanieri gets off to the perfect start: a 3-2 home victory against fellow relegation candidates Southampton\nKamara conflict\nRanieri rages at Aboubakar Kamara after he snatches \u2013 and misses \u2013 a penalty from Aleksandar Mitrovic at home to Huddersfield\nKamara kicked out\nKamara is banned by Fulham and eventually leaves the club in a loan deal following an incident at the training ground\nEmbarrassing exit\nFulham suffer the embarrassment of a home loss to League Two Oldham Athletic in the third-round of the FA Cup\nClaudio is cut loose\nThe losses keep on coming for Fulham and after\u00a0a seventh in eight league games \u2013 at Southampton \u2013 Ranieri is sacked\u00a0\nRanieri has cut an increasingly detached figure standing powerless on the sidelines, a far cry from the amusingly avuncular persona he projected at Leicester, and for the fans at least, defeat at Southampton on Wednesday seemed to confirm their worst fears. Fulham are on course for a quick return to the Championship \u2013 there is even a possibility they could yet be overtaken by the apparently hopeless Huddersfield \u2013 and far from being risk-free Ranieri has proved no more resourceful than Jokanovic. With 10 games remaining there is just about time for a new manager to turn the situation around, though for that to be the case Fulham are going to have to do a lot better at identifying a miracle worker.\nRanieri will simply accept the situation with a wry smile, as he always does. At 67, he too probably ought to think long and hard about his next situation. He has already tried the semi-retirement of international management and if the right offer comes along he may consider a return but his Premier League days are surely over.\nWhile Fulham has not exactly amounted to a highlight on his CV, Ranieri has suffered disappointment and failure before. He will always have Leicester, even if the kudos did not turn out to be transferable.",

His government will engage the chief scientist Alan Finkel to develop a roadmap with the cooperation of Canberra and the states as part of its policy reset that has seen the prime minister travel to the Snowy Hydro scheme and resurrect Tony Abbott\u2019s \u201cDirect Action\u201d emissions plan. It follows Labor\u2019s commitment to spend $1bn on developing clean hydrogen energy, which is being promoted as a replacement for natural gas and is being used overseas in the transport sector and in electricity generation. Australia has the infrastructure and renewable energy capability to scale the production, Finkel says.\nIsrael\u2019s attorney general intends to indict the country\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in three corruption cases, the Israeli justice ministry has said. The decision comes just six weeks before a general election, and the announcement could severely damage Netanyahu\u2019s chances in a tight race. The charges include bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The country\u2019s second-longest serving PM who runs the most rightwing government in its history, Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as part of a witch-hunt orchestrated by the press. He has previously pledged not to resign if indicted and would be under no legal obligation to do so.\nThe New South Wales auditor general has released a damning report into the inability of the state\u2019s gun registry to track ownership and to make decisions about licences. Margaret Crawford\u2019s report says the registry\u2019s owner database was out of date, with 7% of renewal notices being returned every month because they had been sent to the wrong address. In addition, junior staff were often left to make crucial decisions about licence suspensions with the result that more than a quarter of appeals against revocations were successful in the three years to 2016.\nPakistan says it will release a captured Indian pilot as a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d between the neighbours, amid the gravest military crisis in the subcontinent in two decades. The pilot was shot down on Wednesday during a dogfight in the Himalayan foothills, the first between the countries to be publicly acknowledged for 48 years. The Indian pilot, a wing commander identified as Abhi Nandan, appeared in a bloodied uniform as he gave his name and rank in a video released by the Pakistani armed forces. India earlier said one of its air force Mig-21 fighter aircraft has been \u201clost\u201d in an engagement with Pakistani aircraft in the Indian portion of Kashmir and that its pilot was missing.\nDonald Trump has said he took Kim Jong-un \u201cat his word\u201d when he denied any responsibility in the imprisonment and torture of Otto Warmbier that led to the US student\u2019s death in 2017. \u201cSome really bad things happened to Otto,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut Kim tells me that he didn\u2019t know about it and I will take him at his word.\u201d\nThe second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un has ended in failure, with the two sides far apart on the central issues of disarmament and sanctions relief. The abrupt end to the Hanoi meeting, which was cut short by several hours, was a setback from both leaders, and there are no plans for a third summit.\nAn 11-year old girl who became pregnant after being raped was forced to give birth after Argentinian authorities refused to allow her the abortion to which she was entitled.

Barnaby Joyce in New England and Angus Taylor in Hume are among those facing well-connected local candidates in their seats who could profit as centre-right voters drift towards more typically centre-left issues.

She sits down with the Guardian\u2019s Gwilym Mumford to discuss why there should be consequences for disrespecting women sexually, and why The Kindergarten Teacher serves as a warning on the risks of overlooking a women\u2019s mind and needs.\n\u201cShe is a woman who is starving, a woman with a vibrant, curious, artistic mind which has not been fed,\u201d Gyllenhaal says of her character Lisa, a teacher who courts an increasingly problematic relationship with a gifted pupil. \u201cI think many women right now in America \u2013 and I imagine it\u2019s the same in the UK \u2013 are waking up to that feeling.

His pedigree was unique: no other Oscar-winning conductor-composer from the Hollywood film studios became equally successful in the strictly classical world of the London Symphony Orchestra \u2013 which Previn headed from 1968 to 1979 \u2013 while also maintaining a side career as a jazz pianist.\nAs a composer, his successes were singular in their range: from film scores such as that for the Oscar-nominated Elmer Gantry (1960) to stage musicals for the West End (The Good Companions, 1974) and Broadway (Coco, 1970) that were also hits. Later, he returned to composing after a dormant decade with a succession of song cycles, concertos and two major operas, A Streetcar Named Desire (1998) and Brief Encounter (2009), often in a style reaching back to his pre-second world war training in his native Berlin.\nHis adult years were divided between the east and west coasts of the US, as well as the UK, where he enjoyed particular celebrity status and received an honorary knighthood in 1996. \u201cThose of you who think that being a conductor is a succession of limousines and mistresses \u2013 it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s being some place not long enough to have your laundry done and having to work it out,\u201d Previn said in the Tony Palmer documentary film The Kindness of Strangers (1998). He often headed two orchestras simultaneously in separate continents, but whatever country he was in, he was a highly visible, celebrated presence, often hailed as the new guard of classical music \u2013 his humour, accessibility and articulate observational sense demystified his profession \u2013 even though his manner of music-making was mainstream, even conservative. Though critics considered Previn a middleweight talent during his London Symphony Orchestra years, his broadcast-friendly qualities expanded the orchestra\u2019s audience through the TV show Andr\u00e9 Previn\u2019s Music Night (1971-72), and, more indirectly, through the comic alter ego Andrew Preview he created with Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise. In the US, he brought the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to unprecedented national attention during his 1976-84 tenure thanks to the TV series Previn and the Pittsburgh (1977-80).\nThe son of Charlotte (nee Epstein) and Jacob Priwin, he was born Andreas Ludwig Priwin in Berlin, where his father was a successful lawyer. He received an old-world musical education and spent many evenings playing Beethoven symphonies in piano reductions with his father, who emigrated in 1939 with his family first to Paris and then to Los Angeles, which had become a haven for numerous talented German Jewish families fleeing the Nazi regime. The young Previn claimed to have learned English from viewing Hollywood films repeatedly. By the age of 16, he was shuttling from Beverly Hills high school to the film studios, where he worked as an arranger and, later, a composer.\nPrevin\u2019s first publicly performed composition was a water ballet in the 1948 Esther Williams musical On An Island With You. His first full score was for a bizarre combination of stars \u2013 the dog Lassie and the soprano Jeanette MacDonald \u2013 in the film The Sun Comes Up (1949). Unlike young concert performers who take a year or two off their age, Previn added a year. While still a young man, he rose to the top of his profession, working on the most prestigious MGM musicals, though, as documented in his witty memoir of that period, No Minor Chords (1992), the job description sometimes extended well beyond music. While working on the now-classic Gigi (1958), he had to chase around France, where the film was being shot, to find a black swan demanded by the temperamental director Vincente Minnelli, only to be told his swan was not black enough. He won Oscars for his work on Gigi, Porgy and Bess (1959), Irma La Douce (1963) and My Fair Lady (1964).\nDuring this time, Previn\u2019s fascination with jazz led him to transcribe the keyboard improvisations of Art Tatum, note for note. The talent for improvisation that he developed from there took him in a variety of different directions, from spare, serious jazz trio records to more homogenised easy-listening albums. His improvisational extravagance is particularly apparent in the outtakes from his collaboration with Doris Day, an album entitled Duet (1962).\nPrevin\u2019s break with Hollywood was not as clear and decisive as he often described. His formal conducting debut is generally set at 1963 with the St Louis Symphony, soon followed by his first appointment, as music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra, a post he held from 1967 to 1969. However, Previn continued to have film credits, including Rollerball (1975), and his work during those years has a combination of high visibility and shocking unevenness \u2013 coinciding with the industry-wide decline of the film musical.\nThe popular but downmarket Valley of the Dolls (1967), for example, shows Previn and his second wife, the singer-songwriter Dory, at their best with the film\u2019s lovely theme song, Theme to Valley of the Dolls, sung by Dionne Warwick. But Judy Garland rebelled against the clich\u00e9d I\u2019ll Plant My Own Tree \u2013 which contributed to her departure from the film. In later years, Previn could only explain some of these embarrassing efforts by pleading youthful ignorance: he was doing the best with what he knew.\nSubsequent to his Hollywood years, his main compositional effort was a collaboration with the playwright Tom Stoppard, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977), which has enjoyed a steady stream of semi-staged concert performances with symphony orchestra since its premiere, including a 2009 National Theatre revival.\nFor years, Previn was known only as a conductor, his London Symphony Orchestra tenure setting the tone for his international reputation in later decades as \u201ca first-rate conductor of second-rate music\u201d (according to the critic Martin Bernheimer). His strongly score-based interpretive stance stemmed from a seminal moment he had early on: he received bad news just before going onstage and poured his sorrow into the symphony at hand, only to be told afterwards that the performance was interpretively incoherent. Thus, his music making had emotional dignity in his earlier years, but often a less satisfying sobriety in later ones.\nHis London Symphony recordings are often his best, and they are numerous, thanks to such a congenial relationship with EMI that he could phone the company to say that a certain concert was shaping up unusually well, and have a recording team on hand by the end of the week. He championed composers that non-British conductors would not touch at that time, such as Vaughan Williams and William Walton. His hallmark was Russian repertoire: Previn\u2019s discography had more than 250 discs of Prokofiev, and more than 100 each by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov. Most important was the first recording of the uncut version of the Rachmaninov Symphony No 2 in the early 1970s: it brought new respect for the symphony, prompting a positive re-evaluation of the composer\u2019s music at large over the following decades.\nPrevin\u2019s Pittsburgh tenure established further credentials in the French repertoire, and not just Debussy and Ravel. He went through an intensive period conducting Messiaen\u2019s Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie in the late 1970s, and is considered to have greatly aided its dissemination, even though the then radical piece was booed in Pittsburgh.\nAs time went on with the Royal Philharmonic (where he was principal conductor and chief conductor, 1985-92) critics began noticing a lack of fire in both performances and recordings. Previn\u2019s subsequent return to the US west coast to lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic, starting in 1985 \u2013 which might have been the summit of his conducting career \u2013 ended in his stormy resignation in 1989. The orchestra\u2019s general manager, Ernest Fleischmann, who was used to operating independently, offered a Japanese tour to the then little-known Esa-Pekka Salonen without consulting Previn \u2013 one of several slights that left the conductor categorically refusing to return to the orchestra, even with different management, as a guest.\nThough he had short-term relationships as a guest conductor, Previn\u2019s frequent visits to the Vienna Philharmonic were more artistically important, establishing him as a Mozart/Strauss specialist, doubling as soloist and conductor in a Mozart piano concerto followed by a Strauss tone poem. Even later, he became a Bruckner specialist. One of his best, and most overlooked, recording projects was a vigorous, insightful complete Beethoven symphony cycle with the Royal Philharmonic from the early 1990s.\nPrevin often took his pianistic abilities for granted, but they were prized in many circles, not so much for technical prowess as for the way his fingers revealed interpretive insights with great precision and specificity. His earlier recordings were included in the famous Philips-label Great Pianists of the 20th Century series. Some of his best later-in-life performances were in a piano trio he formed with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter (his fifth wife) and the cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott. Among his most irreverent anecdotes \u2013 there were many \u2013 was one about a performance of the Beethoven Triple Concerto in which he was the classical-minded piano soloist, Mstislav Rostropovich was the arch-romantic cellist and Yehudi Menuhin was the technically distressed violinist. As Previn recounted to BBC Music Magazine, the conductor, Leonard Bernstein, was appalled at how badly it all came out, while Menuhin claimed to have experienced something sublime.\nAs a composer, he broke his silence in 1985 with a piano concerto written for Vladimir Ashkenazy, followed by a series of song cycles, including a collaboration with Toni Morrison, Honey and Rue, for Kathleen Battle in 1992. Soon, he was prolific, writing songs, chamber music and all manner of orchestral works. But despite notable success as a composer for opera with A Streetcar Named Desire and Brief Encounter, he also suffered setbacks: he lost battles for the rights to the Alessandro Baricco novel Silk and the play A Man for All Seasons. Among his orchestral works, his Violin Concerto \u201cAnne-Sophie\u201d is among his most successful, the recording of which won a Grammy award in 2004, one of a total of 10; in 2010 he received a lifetime achievement award.\nPrevin appeared to regard his composing life casually. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of self-protection in that,\u201d he once explained. \u201cI have a lot of commissions and it surprises me a great deal. I very often do not like what I write. People like to play it, but the critics say, \u2018What a load of crap!\u2019 It\u2019s difficult for me to cope with.\u201d\nYet composing was his great joy near the end \u2013 something that he could do without any buffer zone from his guest conducting, and while waiting for a flight in airports, which he often joked was the most frequent home for this man without a country. His works had deceptive sophistication. Though they were mostly agreeable in a post-Strauss, neo-Korngold fashion, works such as his Harp Concerto are strangely enigmatic in their collage of contrasting musical events, implying a deep meaning for him.\nQuite remarkable was his 80th year: though he was so infirm that he had great difficulty walking on and off stage to take a bow, he finished a Concerto for Violin, Viola and Orchestra for Mutter and Yuri Bashmet, and unveiled two exceptional concert works written the previous year \u2013 the Harp Concerto for Xavier de Maistre and an orchestral work entitled Owls, for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He also revised sections of his Brief Encounter opera between guest conducting engagements in Philadelphia and Boston.\nPrevin composed prolifically until the end of his life, including a yet to be performed Concerto for Orchestra for the Dresden Staatskapelle and a monodrama with a Stoppard libretto for Ren\u00e9e Fleming on the subject of Penelope (Ulysses\u2019 wife) that is due to be premiered this summer at Tanglewood. \u201cA day without music is a day wasted,\u201d he said in 2017.\nPrevin was married and divorced five times. With his first wife, Betty Bennett, a singer, he had two daughters, Claudia and Alicia (also known as Lovely). He and Dory separated after his affair with the actor Mia Farrow, whom he married in 1970. Together they had six children, Matthew, Sascha, Fletcher, Summer (also known as Daisy), Lark and Soon-Yi. In 1982 he married Heather Sneddon, and they had a son, Lukas, and a daughter, Li-An. Though the stated reasons for his 2006 divorce from Mutter, whom he married in 2002, were vague, it is clear that Previn suffered considerable grief at the end of the union. He referred to Mutter as \u201cmy very best friend\u201d and said that they spoke every day on the phone. Previn described their relationship as \u201cthe divorce that didn\u2019t work\u201d.\nPrevin is survived by nine of his children. His daughter Lark died in 2008.\n Andr\u00e9 George Previn (Andreas Ludwig Priwin), pianist, conductor and composer, born 6 April 1929; died 28 February 2019",

        "content": "Above-inflation hike to \u00a377,468 is almost double 1.5% increase given to parliamentary staff\nWorkers\u2019 representatives have expressed anger over the decision to award MPs a pay rise above inflation and almost double that offered to parliamentary staff.\nThe 2.7% pay hike for MPs, taking their basic annual salary from \u00a377,379 to \u00a379,468, is well above the 1.5% received by those serving them in the Commons and the 1% offered to many civil servants.\nThe \u00a32,089 increase to their income announced on Thursday by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), effective from 1 April, far outstrips the current inflation rate of 1.8% on the main CPI measure.\nMPs\u2019 pay is linked to average rises in the public sector, as determined by the Office for National Statistics. Following reforms to the way MPs\u2019 pay is calculated, the rise is automatic and not subject to a vote in the House of Commons.\nBut Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said: \u201cIt is an outrage that MPs are rewarding themselves with an above-inflation pay rise while civil servants, who do some of the most vital jobs in society, are still subject to a cruel 1% de facto pay cap.\n\u201cPCS are balloting 120,000 members for strike action over pay this summer and today\u2019s news will only anger them further.\u201d\nThe deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, Garry Graham, said: \u201cOur members will see more than a whiff of hypocrisy and double standards in today\u2019s announcement.\u201d\nGraham said that Prospect\u2019s calls for an independent review of pay in the civil service and wider public sector had been repeatedly turned down by ministers. \u201cThere has not been a government in peacetime so reliant on the hard work and dedication of the civil service and its agencies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor MPs to be awarded 2.7% when pay rises for those who serve them are held down at 1.5% or less demonstrates a remarkable level of contempt. As we prepare for pay discussions with the Cabinet Office and Treasury, this announcement will only add to the anger and frustration held by members.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s rise followed a 1.8% rise in MPs\u2019 pay last year and 1.4% in 2017, both of which represented real-term pay cuts, and inflation-busting rises of 1.3% in 2016 and an increase from \u00a367,000 to \u00a374,000 in July 2015.\nThe 2.7% figure was announced by the ONS on an interim basis in December and confirmed last week to Ipsa, which made the final announcement.\nChairs of Commons committees will enjoy a 2.7% increase to the additional salary they receive on top of their basic pay, taking it from \u00a315,509 to \u00a315,928.\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cThe decision taken today is independent of government and parliament. What government sets are ministerial salaries and they have been frozen since 2010.\u201d\nThe Labour MP Kevin Barron said: \u201cI am very disappointed to see that Ipsa has awarded MPs a 2.7% pay increase but only 1.5% for parliamentary staff. I urge them to look again at the budgets as it cannot be right that the gap is so great.\u201d\nUnison\u2019s assistant general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: \u201cPoliticians should now turn their attention to making sure public service workers on outsourced contracts get above-inflation pay rises, too. Many of them missed out on NHS and council pay rises last year but do the same jobs as colleagues. People delivering essential public services shouldn\u2019t be forced to survive on poverty wages.\u201d\nMax Freedman, who chairs the Unite union\u2019s parliamentary staff branch, said workers were only receiving a 1.5% pay rise.\nHe added: \u201cThis real-terms cut for staff of MPs is inadequate and unacceptable, and the fact MPs will be seeing a significantly higher rise is insulting. It seems it\u2019s one rule for elected MPs and another for their hard-working and hard-pressed staff. The huge extra pressure on parliament has significant ramifications for the workload of staff, and this decision will feel to many like a slap in the face.\n\u201cIpsa has failed to properly consult with Unite reps despite our repeated calls for staff to get a fair deal. We have written to Ipsa raising our concerns, and will continue to fight for the real-terms pay rise staff members deserve.\u201d",

Analysis also shows a further 725 companies have filed or resubmitted their figures since last year\u2019s deadline.\nThe shadow secretary for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, said: \u201cGender pay gap reporting was meant to provide transparency, but the fact that companies have given inaccurate data and faced no sanctions makes a mockery of the whole system.\u201d\nResponding to a Freedom of Information request, the EHRC, which is responsible for enforcing the gender pay gap reporting rules, said it had sent enforcement letters to 1,456 companies on 9 April 2018 in relation to last year\u2019s figures and all companies required to submit data had subsequently filed gender pay gap information. However inaccurate figures still remain on the government portal.\nEHRC said they had completed enforcement against 100 employers who submitted suspicious-looking data last year. They said that while they were not currently pursuing enforcement action against any companies who reported last year, that didn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t do so retrospectively. However employers appear to still be filing figures for 2017 as of February 2019.\nDays before the reporting deadline last year, the Guardian reported that a number of companies had filed mathematically impossible results, with gender pay gaps of more than 100%. Some companies had entered zeros in all fields, reported mathematically impossible bonus gaps and removed key workers from their figures.\nEHRC\u2019s chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, responded to the figures by saying: \u201cWe have mechanisms in place to identify questionable data, and have the power to enforce against any employer whose published information doesn\u2019t comply with the legal requirements.\u201d\nBut Guardian analysis of company filings, which were due on 4 April 2018, show that 35 employers still have filed mathematically impossible figures.\nWhat is the gender pay gap?\nThe gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women. The figure is expressed as a proportion of men\u2019s earnings. According to the ONS, the gap between what UK male and female workers earn \u2013 based on median hourly earnings for all workers\u00a0\u2013 was 17.9% in April 2018, down from 18.4% in April 2017. Data in 2018 showed that men were paid more than women in 7,795 out of 10,016 companies and public bodies in Britain.\nWhat is being published?\nAll companies and some public sector bodies in Great Britain, except Northern Ireland, with more than 250 employees had to\u00a0report their gender pay gap to the Government Equalities Office for the first time by by 4 April 2018. The second year of gender pay gap reports\u00a0 - and the first indicator of how public bodies and companies are performing - must be filed by April 2019\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the mean and the median figures?\nCommonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and dividing that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.\nThe median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.\nWhat will happen if companies don\u2019t report?\nThe\u00a0Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)\u00a0said that, while it would approach employers informally at first if they failed to publish figures by the deadline, businesses could ultimately face \u201cunlimited fines and convictions\u201d. However, information published following a freedom of information request by the Guardian showed that no companies have been fined to date despite hundreds failing to accurately file their gender pay gap figures on time.\nAccording to EHRC guidance on enforcing gender pay gap regulations: \u201cEmployers who submit data that has not been calculated in accordance with the [Gender Pay Gap Reporting] will be in breach of the regulations and subject to enforcement action in the same way as those who publish no data at all.\u201d\nThe organisation\u2019s enforcement policy says that, in the first instance, they write to organisations that fail to file their gender pay gap information, setting out the law and asking them to comply within 28 days. If an employer fails to do so, the EHRC can eventually apply for a court order, which could then lead to a financial penalty.\nAmong the companies that missed the deadline for submission or refiled their results for 2017 are the Ministry of Justice, the Law Society, Arriva plc and LK Bennett.\nSo far a total of 1,402 companies have reported their gender pay gaps this year, out of 10,000 which are expected to file. Banks have filed some of the most egregious gender pay gap figures. Barclays Bank plc reported a median gap of 44%, meaning on average women are paid 56p for every \u00a31 a man earns at the company. That figure widens to a 71% median bonus gap, meaning on average women are awarded 29p to every \u00a31 awarded to a man in bonus pay.\nThe bank also disclosed women only account for 19% of its highest paid staff. The data does not show significant changes on the reported 2017 figures, when the hourly pay gap stood at 43.5% and the bonus gap stood at 73%. There has also been no change in the gender diversity among the top earners at the bank.\nLloyds Bank plc reported a median gap of 41.7%, while Royal Bank of Scotland reported a median gap of 36.8%. Lloyds Banking Group reported a pay gap of 32.8% and PricewaterhouseCoopers had a gap of 32.3%.\nButler said that the EHRC should be encouraged to use the full force of its powers to force companies to comply with the law: \u201cNews that the gender pay gap is growing in hundreds of companies is extremely worrying and this latest failure in reporting raises serious questions about the government\u2019s commitment to tackle this issue.\n\u201cThe next Labour government will require employers to publish action plans or face auditing or fines. That\u2019s how to close the gender pay gap.\u201d\nWe'd like to hear what, if anything, has changed since last year. We'd also like to know if any initiatives have worked, and what else needs to be addressed to close the gender pay gap.\nYou can share your experiences by filling in this encrypted form\n \u2013 anonymously if you wish. One of our journalists may be in touch and we will consider some \nof your responses in our reporting. You can \nread terms of service\u00a0here.\nAn EHRC spokesperson said: \u201cIt is an employer\u2019s responsibility to ensure that their figures are correct. Our enforcement against data which looked inaccurate or unlikely has found that they were a result of errors, rather than a deliberate attempt to mislead. We have worked closely with employers to identify and correct errors and have written to those we believe to have inaccurate data.\n\u201cThis has been a steep learning curve for employers and as they get to grips with the calculations, it is likely that fewer errors will be made. As with any self-reporting law, employers can be asked in any reporting year, to verify their historical figures and face enforcement action if found to be deliberately misreporting. Through our enforcement approach we achieved 100% compliance without the need for costly and lengthy legal process, which is something to celebrate.\u201d\n This article was amended on 4 March 2019.

One of our journalists may be in touch and we will consider some \nof your responses in our reporting. You can \nread terms of service\u00a0here.\nThe gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of a company\u2019s male and female employees. If an organisation has, for example, a 5% gender pay gap it means that women earn an average of 5% less per hour (excluding overtime) than men, or in other words the average female employee would earn 95p for every \u00a31 earned by a male employee. A negative 5% gender pay gap would mean women earned an average of 5% more than men per hour.\nAccording to the ONS\u2019s latest Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), the gender pay gap for median gross hourly earnings fell to 8.6% among full-time employees in 2018, from 9.1% the year before. It was 17.4% in 1997 when the ONS first collected the data.\nWhen all workers, full and part-time, are included, the gap increases to 17.9%. This is likely to be because more women work in part-time jobs which tend to be lower paid.\nAccording to the ONS, in 2018 the gender pay gap for full-time employees between the ages of 18 and 39 years was close to zero but began to widen for people over the age of 40. When both full and part-time employees are included in the calculation, the gender pay gap widens after the age of 30. This coincides with an increase in part-time working.\nWhen talking about the gender pay gap people tend to talk about the median figure rather than the mean. The mean is calculated by adding up all of the wages of employees in a company and dividing that figure by the number of employees. This means the final figure can be skewed by a small number of highly paid individuals. The median is the number that falls in the middle of a range when everyone\u2019s wages are lined up from smallest to largest and is more representative when there is a lot of variation in pay.\nIndividual companies and public bodies are responsible for publishing their own gender pay gaps using guidance from the Government Equalities Office. However, the Guardian reported last year that a number of companies had filed mathematically impossible results, with gender pay gaps of more than 100%. As of February this year, that was still the case, with hundreds of companies\u2019 gender pay gap records still including inaccurate figures.\nNo. While some employers might be paying men and women differently for performing the same role or \u201cwork of equivalent value\u201d, this is an issue of equal pay. It is illegal to pay men and women different amounts for the same work, however that is not what gender pay gap reporting is set up to measure. Rather these figures show us the overall gender pay gap, as well as the bonus pay gap and the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the pay structure of the company.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing gender pay gap reporting rules and said that, while it would approach employers informally at first if they failed to publish figures by the deadline, businesses could ultimately face \u201cunlimited fines and convictions\u201d.\nHowever, information published following a freedom of information request by the Guardian showed that no companies have been fined to date despite hundreds failing to accurately file their gender pay gap figures on time. An employer would only be fined if a case were to reach the courts.",

        "content": "Imagine a tent on an exposed clifftop being buffeted by gale force winds. Those inside are already grimly clinging on, only for so-called friends to sneak round and remove all the pegs. Welcome to the world of professional rugby union, where just about every aspect of the game\u2019s future is up in the air.\nFrom player welfare and concussion to commercial uncertainty and political wrangling, there are days when it feels as if rugby is in serious danger of losing its bearings completely. That certainly seems to be the consensus among leading players, supporters and administrators following the publication of the latest blueprint for a proposed World League, a 12-team annual tournament meant to revitalise the traditional Test game for the benefit of all.\nSome of the detail was as chilling as it was brazen. Instead of Fiji, ranked ninth in the world, and Georgia (ranked 12th), the leaked proposal suggested places would be reserved instead for Japan and the US (ranked 11th and 13th respectively) on the basis of their bigger economies. Top-level rugby a game for nations of all shapes and sizes? Not any more.\n\u201cThe death of Pacific Island rugby\u201d is how it has been described by one horrified union chief executive; he might have added that, were it to happen, international rugby will officially forfeit its soul. What kind of sport regards it as progress to suffocate the international aspirations of countries which, pound for pound, produce the best raw rugby talent on the planet? What kind of reputable global leisure industry decides it only wants to hang out with its well-heeled mates, cutting adrift anyone without a well-stuffed wallet? And what does it do both for the standard of rugby in countries outside the elite and the competitiveness of future World Cups?\nNo wonder the game\u2019s governing body, World Rugby, was quick to try to douse the resultant flames. Nothing is set in stone, only a proposal, not what we are trying to achieve etc, etc. Technically, too, World Rugby\u2019s office holders are only the functionaries of the member unions, rather than white cat-stroking madmen operating on a whim. That said, someone with a bit of influence \u2013 and the fingerprints of one prominent rugby nation were all over the NZ Herald story \u2013 would clearly love this latest cynical world domination plan to happen.\nAnd why not, given it would guarantee a dozen years of prime broadcasting dosh and, potentially, access to loads more talented Pacific Island players? Why hang around and represent Fiji for the simple honour and privilege when you can provide for all of your extended family by playing in more compelling matches of a higher standard elsewhere? Even with a five-year qualification period, that is likely to be a better bet than spending 12 years with your nose pressed up to the window of the executive lounge.\nThere will, inevitably, be further twists to this saga. One theory is that this is all about seeking to push the Six Nations towards agreeing in future to promotion and relegation \u2013 or a play-off at the very least. After all, is a closed shop not what already exists in Europe? If the Six Nations wishes to stick to its establishment membership, how can any of the home unions complain about the system being not strictly meritocratic elsewhere?\nThe one thing that everyone appears to agree on is that something has to change. Rugby cannot endlessly live on the razor-wire separating the rival international and club games; a way also has to be found to make the physical and mental demands on its players more manageable.\nAs the International Rugby Players\u2019 forceful statement emphasised, the sport\u2019s leading names are already buckling under the strain even before they are asked to commit to five Tests on successive autumn weekends plus increased long-haul air travel. Johnny Sexton, the player organisation\u2019s president, described the latest proposals as \u201cout of touch\u201d and, as such, they do not currently have the players\u2019 support.\nReforming the ad-hoc Test schedule and dovetailing it better with domestic fixture lists has topped the game\u2019s wish-list for almost three decades now. In that sense nothing has changed, other than the feeling of urgency. \u201cIf you ask me as a businessman, the business side of rugby is not working,\u201d said World Rugby\u2019s vice-chairman, Agust\u00edn Pichot, in September, urging everyone within the game to come to their senses. \u201cIf you ask me the playing side is not working. Is the international game under threat? I think it is. I\u2019m not going to be an accomplice to rugby\u2019s ruin.\u201d\nAlmost six months further down the line, that last phrase continues to resonate. Rugby urgently needs to find proper answers with player welfare at their heart. Cutting off the have-nots to make life cosier for the haves cannot be the way forward if rugby wishes to retain even a semblance of a collective conscience.",

We recognise that as a movement we have been too slow to acknowledge this problem, too tolerant of the existence of antisemitic views within our ranks, too defensive and too eager to downplay it.\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise to the Jewish community, and our Jewish comrades in the party, for our collective failure on this issue to date.\u201d\nThe initiative was supported by Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, with many sharing the hashtag #Socialists4Change, amid deep anguish in the party about its approach to antisemitism. Momentum also released a video online debunking antisemitic conspiracy theories.\nTom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, said on Thursday that he regarded Berger\u2019s departure last week as \u201cthe worst day of shame in the party\u2019s 120-year history\u201d.\nHe told Radio 5: \u201cIt is a badge of shame that Luciana Berger, a bright, young, female, pregnant MP, was bullied out of her own constituency by racist thugs, and I\u2019m not putting up with it.\u201d\nHe went on to accuse Williamson of having been \u201cdeliberately inflammatory\u201d over antisemitism in the party and described Labour as \u201ccurrently mired in a racism scandal\u201d.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live that disciplinary action should be concluded swiftly against the Derby North MP, who had the whip removed and was suspended from the party.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely weeks, not months, in my view,\u201d Watson said. Although he said Williamson should be allowed to present his case in a formal hearing, the deputy leader condemned his comments.\nIn the footage, first revealed by the Yorkshire Post, Williamson was applauded by activists in Sheffield when he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d\nWatson said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen his recent contributions that have appeared online and was very concerned it was almost like he was being deliberately inflammatory, deliberately trying to cause offence to people who are concerned about antisemitism \u2013 not just the Jewish community but people who are fighting racism in their daily political lives.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m very clear \u2013 his behaviour in my view was unacceptable, which is why it was absolutely right for the whip to be removed and him to be suspended.\u201d\nWilliamson, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, remains popular with some Labour members. On the MP\u2019s Facebook page, of 800 comments under his apology for the comments, the vast majority were supportive, and many condemned Watson.\nIn his first comment after the suspension, Williamson tweeted thanks to Labour members and supporters \u201cfor the incredible solidarity you have shown me over the last 48 hours\u201d, adding a link to a song popular in the US civil rights movement, Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.\nI want to thank grassroots Labour Party members and supporters from the bottom of my heart for the incredible solidarity you have shown me over the last 48 hours.My message is this:Keep your eyes on the prize and hold on because #ChangeIsCominghttps://t.co/WBBKoCpN5E\nWilliamson issued his apology on Wednesday over the filmed comments. Shortly afterwards, a spokesman for Corbyn announced Williamson had been issued with a \u201cnotice of investigation\u201d; but he would remain a Labour member.\nSeveral backbenchers told the Guardian they were convinced Corbyn himself had been involved in the decision not to suspend Williamson immediately. But a Labour spokesman insisted: \u201cJeremy did not intervene.\u201d\nThe party announced his suspension on Wednesday evening following an outcry from a series of Labour MPs, 38 of whom wrote jointly to the Labour general secretary, Jennie Formby, to demand the move.\nWilliamson was also facing complaints about having booked a room in parliament to screen a controversial film about Jackie Walker, an activist suspended from the party.\nWatson deflected a series of questions on Radio 5 about whether Corbyn should speak out more strongly on the issue, and condemn Williamson, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s not letting me down. He has to make his own decisions.\u201d",

Conrad Simon, one of New York\u2019s air pollution scientists, said: \u201cWe came close to closing the city down.\u201d Power stations were temporarily switched from coal to oil, building owners were asked to turn down thermostats to 15C (59F) and the city\u2019s waste incinerators were switched off, but again about 200 people died.

Now, five years on from flopping at the Commonwealth Games, Muir is relishing the chance to make history at the European Indoor Championships.\nIf all goes to plan the 25-year-old will claim 3,000m gold on Friday night and then rapidly follow it up with a 1500m title on Sunday \u2013 an achievement that would not only repeat her success in Belgrade two years ago but also make her the first person, male or female, to ever achieve a \u201cdouble-double\u201d at these championships.\n\u201cFive years ago I struggled with pressure quite a lot,\u201d admitted Muir, who finished 11th in the 1500m before pulling out of the 800m. \u201cI just got really nervous and found that I didn\u2019t race very well. Now I have psychologically flipped things and it has worked really well. I had a lot of pressure for Berlin last year for the outdoors but I dealt with that fine and came away with the win. So coming into Glasgow I feel more relaxed and more excited than anything.\u201d\nNot that it will be easy given that the German Konstanze Klosterhalfen, who has kicked on impressively since joining Alberto Salazar\u2019s Nike Oregon Project group, is lurking in the 3,000m. To add to Muir\u2019s challenge, she also has to race in the heats of the 1500m two and a half hours\u2019 before the 3,000m.\nHowever, the Scot is confident of rising to the challenge. \u201cWe would only do it if I was fit enough to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out there and do a mediocre performance. I want to go out there and smash it.\u201d\nHer coach, Andy Young, meanwhile, bills the 3,000m final as the race of the championships. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely epic race, like Mary Decker-Slaney v Zola Budd in the 80s,\u201d he says, with a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope it ends better than it did for those two in 1984.\u201d\nMuir proved her form a fortnight ago by smashing the British indoor mile record by more than five seconds, but there were suggestions afterwards that her racing spikes may have been a prototype and thus illegal. Young, however, dismissed it as \u201ca bit of a \u201cnon-story. The last time I checked there was no complaint.\n\u201cWe brought them in for training rather than racing, but she liked them,\u201d he added, pointing out that other athletes had worn the same-type spikes last summer. \u201cI think she could have run near enough in high heels in Birmingham and it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference.\u201d\nWith Muir primed for success, the British team are hopeful of exceeding the 10 medals they won at this event in Belgrade in 2017, and they should get a second gold on the opening night with Katarina Johnson-Thompson an overwhelming favourite in the women\u2019s pentathlon.\nIt helps the Briton\u2019s case that the reigning champion, Nafi Thiam, is absent with a calf injury. However Johnson-Thompson, who believes she is in the best condition of her career, lamented the opportunity to put one over her great Belgium rival. \u201cI\u2019m sad she\u2019s not here,\u201d she said. \u201cI love competing against her. I love the battle of it. I think she brings out the best in me.\u201d\nElsewhere Jakob Ingebrigtsen, the brilliant teenage Norwegian, is favourite to win gold in the men\u2019s 1500m and 3000m, while the German pole vaulter Katha Bauer will become the first athlete to compete in a major championships with a defibrillator, which she had fitted last year, although she is unlikely to win a medal.\nHowever, the British team captain, Guy Learmonth, who is competing with a broken finger and badly bruised ribs sustained at the Birmingham grand prix two weeks ago, believes he can overcome his own medical problems in the men\u2019s 800m. \u201cIf I break my hand in the process of winning, I won\u2019t care,\u201d he said.",

But two penalties in quick succession amid an ongoing tussle with the Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones saw Eddie Jones withdraw Sinckler just before the hour mark, with Gatland suggesting after the match his ploy to target England\u2019s No 3 \u2013 who he had described as an \u201cemotional time bomb\u201d \u2013 had worked.\nSinckler\u2019s apparent loss of composure coincided with Wales seizing the momentum in their 21-13 victory but Mitchell does not want the 24-year-old, who was also involved in flashpoints against Ireland, to lose his fiery edge. \u201cIn this generation of players, you don\u2019t have a lot of players who do [play on the edge],\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cSo he is unique in the way that he does play on the edge and the last thing that we want to do is ever take that away from him because it is something that he can bring to us in a very positive way.\n\u201cGats won the Test, didn\u2019t he, so he can say what he likes. At the end of the day, most teams are targeting the best players; the great thing is that they see him as one of our best players. In itself, that is a great accolade. So now that he understands he is in that bracket, he can actually use it to his and our advantage.\n\u201cHe is 24 years of age, an exceptionally gifted athlete as a tighthead; he\u2019s going to be a very good player for England, he already is. As he matures, he is going to be outstanding. He is just going through a process, like any young man, learning and growing in self-awareness. I think we are blessed with an outstanding player. Kyle is a guy with an abundance of talent and all the game is doing now is asking him to contribute to the team, when it really matters, without losing his ability to play on the edge.\u201d\nTempers flared again, meanwhile, as Sinckler and co locked horns with Georgia at England\u2019s training camp in Oxford on Thursday. When the two sides took part in a live scrummaging session on Wednesday, a mass brawl erupted, with punches thrown in front of a large group of onlooking schoolchildren. On Thursday, scrums were off the menu but during a high-octane match scenario, a thumping tackle again prompted things to briefly boil over again \u2013 much to the delight of the watching schoolchildren who burst into loud applause.\n\u201c[Being] put in the heat of the moment and then coming away from it with a clear head and getting a good rugby result out of it \u2013 it has been great for us,\u201d said the England lock George Kruis. \u201cIt is all well thought of by the coaches and they spend hours thinking of the psyche and why and how we do things.\n\u201cI understand it might be portrayed as a minor thing and guys going at it, but it is well thought-of and calculated and it gives us a chance to go against an opposition we don\u2019t play too much. Chuck some curve balls in and figure it out.\u201d\nWith no scrums taking place, both England and Georgia practised lineouts and mauling as well as their mini-match, in which both sides scored two tries apiece. Maro Itoje did not take part as he continues his rehabilitation from knee ligament damage and neither did Jonny May, who is continuing his return-to-play protocols from a head injury, while Jack Nowell is nursing a minor knock. England are hopeful all three will be available to face Italy on Saturday week.",

Despite criticism of the senator\u2019s seemingly dismissive reaction, Clarke tells the Guardian the moment was \u201cinstrumental in moving the Green New Deal forward\u201d.\nThe video, which made the internet rounds over the weekend, was filmed on Friday during a meeting between Feinstein and children, teens and parents involved in various Bay Area activist groups, including Youth vs Apocalypse, 350.org, Bay Area Earth Guardians and the Sunrise Movement.\nThe group was hoping to convince Feinstein to vote yes on the Green New Deal, a congressional resolution introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward J Markey.\n\u201cI think that the meeting, though disappointing, was super important,\u201d Clarke said. Feinstein resisted promising a yes vote on the Green New Deal in favor of her own resolution. But Clarke credits the meeting with fueling new activism. This week, Sunrise activists poured into Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office.\nClarke says Feinstein\u2019s reaction in the video is beside the point.\n\u201cI want politicians to not only vote yes when it comes down to the vote, but to also be very clear to the larger public that they are in support of the Green New Deal,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still this kind of fantastical connotation that comes with when you talk [with politicians] about climate change and the climate crisis. We need politicians to recognize and actually speak on the fact that climate change, and this climate crisis that we\u2019re facing, is a real issue. And it\u2019s something that we need to address right now.\u201d\nAlthough Clarke was offered an internship in Feinstein\u2019s office at the conclusion of the Friday meeting, she says that the offer is a distraction from the real issue.\n\u201cA lot of people have used [the internship offer] to, like, change the whole encounter, you know?\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe had this whole super-heated, powerful exchange, and then people were saying, \u2018but it ended like on a happy note, one of the kids even got an internship!\u2019 That\u2019s defeating the whole purpose of why we were there.\u201d\nThe Green New Deal \u201cis really the only thing right now that accurately addresses the climate crisis, and that aligns with science\u201d, Clarke said. \u201cWe have to be putting our energy in passing it.\u201d\nClarke said she had been inspired by the student climate strikes in the UK and other parts of Europe \u2013 she\u2019s a self-described \u201cfangirl\u201d of Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen activist. Clarke said she was helping to organize a student climate strike in the US on 15 March, though logistics were still being worked out.\nSince the meeting with Feinstein, who did not respond to a request for comment, Clarke\u2019s schedule has been packed with interviews and political organizing.\n\u201cThe truth is that young people are going to be at the forefront of the climate crisis if nothing is done. We are the people who are directly affected. And the people who are directly affected in any issue should be at the forefront of the movement to change it,\u201d she said.",

Such was his impact on his hometown club throughout a glittering two-decade career, the Saints christened the move to their new stadium with a statue of him taking pride of place outside.\nWhen he retired, the thankless task of succeeding him fell on the shoulders of James Roby; yet at this rate, there is a fair chance Roby may get his own statue by the time he retires, too. Such was the nature of this performance from St Helens, it would be unfair to simply attribute their fourth consecutive victory to the 33-year-old but how he played a telling role here.\nBy the end, Roby had combined with stand-off Th\u00e9o Fages to menacing effect, scoring two tries and producing another lung-busting display to help the Saints move top of the table and continue their unbeaten start to 2019. \u201cThat performance adds to his legendary status, and it\u2019s fully deserved,\u201d Roby\u2019s coach, Justin Holbrook, said.\nFages was equally deserving of the plaudits here too, though. The French international was a surprise pick ahead of Danny Richardson in the halves at the start of this season, but he was crucial in helping the Saints establish a 16-0 lead here which, realistically, an injury-hit, out-of-sorts Salford were never likely to overcome.\nFages\u2019 pinpoint kick for Mark Percival helped open the scoring, before the stand-off combined with half-back partner Jonny Lomax to make it 10-0. Roby then took centre-stage, scoring instinctively out of dummy-half and even then, before half-time, it was clear Salford would not be able to threaten a resolute St Helens defence enough to overturn the deficit.\n\u201cSt Helens were outstanding defensively,\u201d said the Salford coach, Ian Watson. His side still have an impressive record of three wins from five to start the season, but will count the cost of a number of key injuries to forwards here which made their task a near-impossible one. They battled commendably \u2013 underlined by Derrell Olpherts\u2019 try after half-time, but that was as good as it got.\nAfter Lomax and Lachlan Coote combined to free winger Regan Grace for St Helens\u2019 fourth try, it was fitting that Fages and Roby had the final say. Fages\u2019 wonderful pass freed Tommy Makinson downfield and though he was felled by two Salford defenders, Roby defied his age to react quickest and scamper over for his second try.\nSalford Evalds; Olpherts, Welham, Sa\u2019u, Sio; Lui, Hastings; Mossop, Lussic, Duson, Jones, Turgut, Murray Interchange McCarthy, Nakubuwai, Burke, Tomkins Try Olpherts\nSt Helens Coote; Makinson, Costello, Percival, Grace; Lomax, Fages; Walmsley, Roby, Thompson, Taia, Peyroux, Knowles.

He said farmers \u201cdon\u2019t want compensation, [they] want reconstruction\u201d.\nKatter took credit, saying in a statement the catalyst for the decision was his invitation to the prime minister to visit Julia Creek and Cloncurry.\n\u201cSo after 25 years of battle, we have got an enlightened government decision,\u201d Katter said\n\u201cAll these people will have their debt significantly reduced, and will now be paying one third of what they were currently paying to the banks (until now). And all of this is costing the tax payers nothing.\u201d\nIn February Morrison said he was working with Katter on the issue \u201cbecause the northern Australian cattle industry needs our support\u201d, rebuffing suggestions the negotiations were designed to avoid extra sitting weeks.\nIn November Katter and Morrison reached a deal in which he agreed to provide $200m for water projects to shore up Katter\u2019s support in the House of Representatives following the loss of the government\u2019s lower house majority.\nIn February Morrison hinted he could revoke the deal if the maverick MP sided with Labor and fellow crossbenchers to support an extension of the parliamentary sitting calendar against the government\u2019s wishes.",

        "content": "Anyone who has watched Sean Longstaff play will understand why his name appears in sentences also featuring the words balance, poise, vision and assurance.\nPerhaps a little part of that is due to the year in which Newcastle\u2019s midfielder of the moment spent every spare hour virtually living on an ice rink in Stockholm where his father, David, starred for Djurg\u00e5rden, one of Sweden\u2019s leading ice hockey teams.\nBy the time he returned to north-east England and began playing football for North Shields juniors, Sean was still only five but, already, his game seemed unusually well calibrated. For one so young, his calmness under pressure suggested that something of the Stockholm ice had transported itself into his veins.\nUnbeknown to a primary school prodigy swiftly recruited by Newcastle\u2019s academy, his father\u2019s career had reached a sliding-doors moment. David Longstaff\u2019s talent was much coveted \u2013 he would become the first Great Britain ice hockey player to win 100 caps \u2013 and there were offers to emigrate to Canada from NHL sides.\nA new life on another continent beckoned but he and his wife Michelle \u2013 an excellent netball player \u2013 could not quite break the ties to north Tyneside where David, 44, is the player-coach of Whitley Warriors.\nStaying put dictated that Sean and his brother Matty \u2013 two years younger and another midfielder, impressing for Newcastle\u2019s Under-23s \u2013 were destined to concentrate on football rather than ice hockey.\nAlready, Sean has emulated his uncle, the former winger Alan Thompson, in breaking into Newcastle\u2019s first team. The 21-year-old has spent part of this week telling television interviewers he is \u201cliving the dream\u201d after earning lavish plaudits in the course of the 12 appearances \u2013 eight in the Premier League \u2013 he has made for Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side this season.\nSince making his league debut as a substitute in the 4-0 Boxing Day defeat at Liverpool, highlights have included a key role in a January home win against Manchester City and his first league goal, scored in Tuesday\u2019s 2-0 home victory over Burnley.\nLongstaff\u2019s two-footed central-midfield skills have attracted the attention of the England Under-21 manager, Aidy Boothroyd, who seems certain to call him up to his next squad, not to mention numerous comparisons with another Geordie, the former Manchester United and England midfielder Michael Carrick.\nIf the similarities in the pair\u2019s straight-backed running style are irresistible, they also share a certain serenity, namely that invaluable knack of appearing to always find time on the ball and rarely looking rushed or snatching at passes.\nThrow in vision and a varied passing range and we are in doppelg\u00e4nger territory but Ben\u00edtez emphasises some differences. \u201cI can see that [the Carrick likeness],\u201d says Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cBut, at this stage, Sean has more mobility and stamina. Certainly he has the technique and he can use both feet as well.\u201d\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\nThere is always a danger in over-hyping a player, however promising, with such little experience, but there appears minimal danger of Longstaff\u2019s head being turned. \u201cFirst and foremost, Sean\u2019s a great lad,\u201d says the Newcastle winger Matt Ritchie. \u201cFrom the first day he came into our group to now he\u2019s exactly the same guy. Sean\u2019s going to have one hell of a career if he keeps his feet on the floor and keeps working. But he\u2019ll do that, no doubt about it. He\u2019s a top player and a fantastic lad.\u201d\nLongstaff has no England youth caps and had an unremarkable loan stint at Kilmarnock before being borrowed by League One Blackpool last season. It would prove a watershed.\nGary Bowyer was particularly impressed by his goalscoring ability \u2013 with both feet. \u201cIt was Sean\u2019s goal return from midfield [nine] that was outstanding,\u201d says Blackpool\u2019s then manager. \u201cHe has this unbelievable knack of scoring, often from long range. He\u2019s got a fantastic engine and fitness, and his knowledge of the game is very good. He did brilliantly for Blackpool.\u201d\nPortsmouth wanted Longstaff on loan last summer but Ben\u00edtez retained him as midfield cover. When Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diam\u00e9 were sidelined by injury and Ki Sung-yueng headed to Abu Dhabi with South Korea for the Asian Cup in late December, a big chance materialised.\nA little over two months on, Shelvey, Diam\u00e9 and Ki are sitting on the sidelines, while Ben\u00edtez\u2019s decision not to pursue a long-mooted January loan move for Benfica\u2019s Greece midfielder Andreas Samaris appears vindicated. \u201cRafa made a shrewd decision in keeping Sean in the fold,\u201d Bowyer says. \u201cSean\u2019s learned a lot from training under him and he\u2019s grabbed his chance. Now, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be allowed to get carried away. That inner drive is there in Sean.\n\u201cAt Blackpool he had to cope with living away from home and he learned a hell of a lot about himself but, mentally, Sean is tough. He\u2019s also very level-headed; he\u2019s always looking to improve. There is so much more to come from him.\u201d",

        "content": "Left-back is \u2018mentally tough\u2019 and United\u2019s player of the season, says teammate Romelu Lukaku\nIt has been an interesting part of the Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r revolution at Manchester United \u2013 perhaps not the most high-profile but a component nonetheless and an element in the movement that appears to be sweeping the caretaker manager towards the job on a permanent basis.\nLuke Shaw was outstanding in the club\u2019s 3-1 win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday, having also starred in the 0-0 home draw with Liverpool on Sunday. According to Romelu Lukaku, the 23-year-old left-back has been United\u2019s player of the season so far. And it has been difficult to ignore the evidence that his performances have gone up a level since Solskj\u00e6r took over from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in December.\nThe Norwegian has brought liberation to virtually every pore of the club and it has been clear to see how players such as Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford have thrived under his charge. But Shaw, too, has grown, having been encouraged by Solskj\u00e6r to play higher up the pitch and express himself more freely. Moreover, and this might be key, he has been able to do so without the fear of reprisals if he makes mistakes.\nShaw had always felt like one of Mourinho\u2019s whipping boys. In March last year, the then manager humiliated him by substituting him at half-time against Brighton in the FA Cup. There were other examples of Mourinho publicly taking him to task: one of the most infamous came in April 2017 when he urged Shaw to change his football brain. It should be noted that Mourinho\u2019s predecessor, Louis Van Gaal, also preferred the stick to the carrot when it came to dealing with Shaw.\nMourinho would argue that the tough love worked. Last October, Shaw was rewarded for his positive start to the season with a new five-year contract; a development that had previously been hard to foresee. Yet what has shone through behind the scenes during Shaw\u2019s trials and tribulations has been his mental toughness.\nMourinho would criticise him over his mentality but it takes a hard edge to withstand the knocks that Shaw has taken, which include the horrific leg break that he suffered in September 2015.\nBefore the start of pre-season, Shaw took himself to Dubai for a personal training camp with United\u2019s head of strength and conditioning, Gary Walker, and he always believed that this would be the season when United saw the best of him, having taken him from Southampton for \u00a327m in 2014.\nLukaku, who scored twice in the victory at Palace, had no doubts either. \u201cLuke\u2019s our player of the season \u2013 from the start until now, he\u2019s been the most consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? His preparation. The whole summer, we were in touch, when I was in Russia [with Belgium for the World Cup], I used to get videos of him working out and stuff.\n\u201cI knew that this year would be his year. That\u2019s what I told him, as well, at the end of last season \u2013 that he has the potential to be the England left\u2011back for many, many years and for Manchester United, the same. It\u2019s about being that guy.\n\u201cThe previous criticism did not hurt him. People that don\u2019t know Luke don\u2019t know that he\u2019s mentally really tough. It\u2019s a side that not a lot of people talk about but it has to be known that, mentally, he\u2019s a really strong guy.\u201d\nShaw takes all of the credit for his upsurge but it feels as though he has responded to the tactical and man\u2011management approach of Solskj\u00e6r who, at present, can do little wrong. Even Lukaku, who has been on the bench more times than he has started under Solskj\u00e6r in the Premier League, speaks warmly of him.\n\u201cI like him,\u201d Lukaku said. \u201cHe\u2019s really open, really honest in his communication. He keeps me hungry so whenever I get a chance to play, I just want what\u2019s best for the team and to help the team win.\u201d\nThe Palace success meant that Solskj\u00e6r maintained his perfect away record as the United manager \u2013 it is now eight wins out of eight in all competitions \u2013 while his complete league record reads P11 W9 D2. He could not have done any more to press his candidacy for the post beyond the end of the season because the results have been accompanied by fast and exciting football.\nAt the heart of everything has been the change in atmosphere that Solskj\u00e6r has overseen. United have made no secret of how this had to happen after Mourinho. Shaw has enjoyed the benefits.",

        "content": "US designer\u2019s Paris fashion week show keeps its sense of fun even if its style is more formal\nVirgil Abloh, the US designer who turned sports kit and irony into high fashion, performed a U-turn at his Off-White show on Thursday night by showing a collection without a single tracksuit.\nOn a checkerboard catwalk, in an unexpectedly hallowed Parisian hotel conference centre \u2013 Alexander McQueen used to show here a decade ago \u2013 the streetwear designer turned his attention instead towards a grownup wardrobe, which was split between minimalism and glamour, colour and neutrals. In short, old Off White and a new direction. For every pair of trainers, there was a pair of heels.\nThe show opened with a beige trench coat and a side-tying dress in bone, a look which set the tone for a quiet first half. Out came proper coats with lapels in cream or black satin, and then leather suits and jackets so long they swept the floor. Then came some fun: faux fur coats in acidic shades of pink and green, and an enormous checked padded coat that resembled a pregnancy pillow, but these were quickly followed by more suits, this time in blue satin, and ribbed high-necked dresses. There were flashes of silver, and some rolled up latex gloves not dissimilar to the ones worn by Lady Gaga to the Oscars, but there was also a lot of black and a lot of tailoring.\nThe theme of the show was ostensibly motor racing, and aside from the chequerboard catwalk and some printed pieces, one coat was embroidered with, \u201cthings are closer than they appear\u201d. But this line alluded more to things not being as they seem.\nNew takes on old pieces is part of Abloh\u2019s code \u2013 that\u2019s why his collaborations have made him a rich man \u2013 but this collection was very clearly split. The overall sum was rooted in streetwear (or, specifically race cars) but, taken apart, the parts were nothing short of feminine. Many of the looks were even suitable for work, not a common theme in an Off White show.\nAs if aware of this tension, Abloh had planted clues. The catwalk changed colour before and after the show, and the music pivoted from Brooklyn 1990s hip-hop act Digable Planets to world-renowned organist Kevin Bower. Shorts were worn over trousers and the models were in on the act: the final segment was made of voluminous gowns, inspired apparently by those chequered flags, underneath which the Hadid sisters/models deliberately flashed their hot pants. The result was a moment of transformation, like insects emerging from their pupae, and significant in relation to the rest of the show, which seemed to be in flux.\nIn its six years Off-White has become known for its streetwear and high fashion, which has hinged on identifiable motifs (quotation marks, self-referential irony and police tape are recurring themes). Then there are the collaborations, ranging from Nike and Moncler to Ikea and a bench company, useful reminders that he was educated in engineering and architecture before his new-ish career as a designer.\nThis shift marks another departure for Abloh. But there was still enough to appease his hypebeast fans \u2013 the word \u201coff\u201d was splashed on the clavicles of most of the pieces, the shoelaces had the words \u201cshoelaces\u201d\u2019 spelled out, and glass bottles of Virgil Abloh-branded Evian were handed out to guests at the end.\nAbloh\u2019s success has been in compartmentalising between Louis Vuitton, where he is artistic director of the men\u2019s collections, and Off-White, the label he started in 2013. On Thursday night, he brought some of that sophistication to the Off White catwalk to show that he can be as fluent in luxury as he is in trainers.",

In the past two weeks, 11 infants were in detention at one time, though two of the children have since been released.\n\u201cMost of these babies have been sick and not getting better,\u201d Murdza said. \u201cA lot of moms are saying that they are crying much more than they normally do. They are crying all night and keeping people up in shared dorm rooms. There are a lot of kids who are really congested, sometimes having trouble breathing, coughing a lot.\u201d\nMurdza said the mothers, who are Honduran, said they do not always get bottled water with baby formula and they are concerned the detention center\u2019s tap water is not clean enough. The mothers also complained that there have been sudden changes in the formula they are given \u2013 even though doctors advise formula to be changed gradually because of infants\u2019 sensitive digestive systems.\nAt least one of the infants has been detained for more than 20 days, according to the complaint. Under the Flores agreement, it is illegal to hold a child in immigration detention for more than 20 days, though the Trump administration has attempted to modify that rule.\nThe American Immigration Lawyers Association, American Immigration Council and Catholic Legal Immigration Network, filed the complaint and are partners with the Dilley Pro Bono Project.\nIn the complaint, the coalition said it had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the medical care available at the facility for this vulnerable population, in part because of previously documented delays in detainees receiving medical attention and a lack of appropriate follow-up treatment.\nIce said in a statement that the agency provides \u201ccomprehensive medical care\u201d to all detained individuals, including registered nurses, licensed mental health providers, a physician and dental care. It said: \u201cIce is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency\u2019s custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care.\u201d\nThe complaint included a statement from the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) condemning the detention of children in detention centers.\nIt read: \u201cPHR is alarmed about the inherent health risks for infants in detention, as infants have specific health needs which detention centers are ill-equipped to meet.\u201d\nIn addition to requesting immediate release of the infants, advocates urged DHS to review any documents showing medical problems the infants have experienced in detention, the medical services that are available and its decisions to detain these infants.",

He told her: \u201cNo, no, you have to do more.\u201d The woman snorted from the spoon again.\nThe court also heard that a woman named Paulina Aberg, who lives in Sweden, claimed Broughton photographed her after she fell and banged her head while taking drugs.\nMousley said Aberg found an image of herself on Broughton\u2019s phone, which she deleted.\n\u201cShe also says over and above that specific incident that she was aware that the defendant had images of people suffering, including suffering death, on his phone in which he appeared to have some interest,\u201d the prosecutor added. He said the potential evidence was \u201ccapable of establishing a pattern of behaviour which supported the prosecution case\u201d.\nBroughton\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Kamlish QC, said Aberg\u2019s claims about her fall were \u201cnot true\u201d. He added: \u201cWhether or not the defendant was with her when it happened, he didn\u2019t know she was hurt because she has to tell him,\u201d Kamlish said.\nKamlish argued the evidence might make the jury think Broughton \u201ctook an unhealthy pleasure in Louella\u2019s suffering\u201d, which had \u201cnever\u201d been the case.\nHe said Fletcher-Michie, daughter of the Holby City actor John Michie, had wanted to take drugs at Bestival and Broughton had admitted providing her with some on a previous occasion.\n\u201cThis has never been the case of the defendant forcing drugs on anyone, they go off to take drugs together because she wants to,\u201d he said.\nIn a written ruling given to the Press Association, judge Mr Justice Goose said the video clips \u201coffer little, if anything to assist the jury\u201d because the type and supply of the drug being offered was unclear.\nThe judge added there was \u201cno doubt the deceased wanted to take drugs\u201d at Bestival and Broughton had already admitted supplying drugs to her in June 2017. Goose said Aberg\u2019s statement had come too late to \u201cbe fair to the defence\u201d.",

Sydney\u2019s market moved into double digit declines for the first time since the early 1980s.\n\u201cIf Melbourne\u2019s downturn continues at a similar pace we are likely to see the annual decline move into double-digit falls over the coming months as well, with values currently 9.1% lower over the year,\u201d he said.\nHouse prices in regional Tasmania and larger cities surrounding Melbourne were recording strong growth because of lifestyle and affordability appeal.\nSouth-east Tasmanian prices were up 9% and Ballarat 7.9%.\nThe report identified Canberra and Hobart as the tightest rental markets, with tenants paying an extra 4.7% and 4.6% respectively compared with a year ago.\n\u201cThe February housing market results marked a subtle improvement in the rate of decline, however the housing market downturn is now more widespread geographically and we aren\u2019t seeing any indicators pointing to the market bottoming out just yet,\u201d he said.\nHe said the long-running reduction in investment lending had impacted the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets more than others.\n\u201cStricter lending standards are a logical outcome following the [banking] royal commission and we are likely in the early phases of a \u2018new normal\u2019 for mortgage lending where borrowers will face closer scrutiny around their expenses and ability to service a loan and conversion rates on loan applications are likely to remain lower than they have been over prior years,\u201d Lawless said.",

The 225-metre ship was carrying up to 600 tonnes of fuel oil as well as a full load of bauxite, the main ore used to make aluminium.\nThe clean-up operation could take months, and may require further assistance from countries such as Australia.\n\u201cOnce it hits rock the heavy fuel oil is effectively like a bitumen-like substance and has to be removed by hand,\u201d a source in the Solomon Islands with knowledge of the incident said.\nThe oil is yet to reach East Rennell, the largest raised coral atoll in the world and a world heritage site.

However, the number of offences per reoffender has increased by 22%.\nIn 2013, the programme was launched by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) under Grayling, who was then the justice secretary, with the aim of cutting reoffending rates in England and Wales and reducing costs.\nIt created 21 community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) to manage low- and medium-risk offenders, while the National Probation Service (NPS) continued to manage high-risk offenders across seven regions.\nAs a result of supervision by probation being extended to people serving less than 12-month sentences, the number of recalls to prison has increased by 47%.\nOffenders on licence can be sent back to prison if they reoffend or break other probation conditions, such as missing meetings with probation officers without good reason or travelling abroad without permission.\nAmyas Morse, the NAO chief, said: \u201cThe ministry set itself up to fail in how it approached probation reforms. Its rushed rollout created significant risks that it was unable to manage.\n\u201cNot only have these failings been extremely costly for taxpayers, but we have seen the number of people on short sentences recalled to prison skyrocket.\u201d\nLast July, the justice secretary, David Gauke, announced that private companies running CRCs would have their contracts terminated in 2020, two years earlier than agreed.\nSo far, they have received \u00a3467m in projected bailouts, a proportion of which was given to cover penalties owed by the companies for failing to meet targets under Grayling\u2019s \u201cpayment by results\u201d system.\nWhen current contract-holders were in the bidding process, their collected forecasted profits were \u00a3269m, but by March 2018 CRCs faced collective losses of \u00a3294m.\nRory Stewart, the prisons and probation minister, said: \u201cTransforming Rehabilitation has meant that we are now monitoring 40,000 more offenders than we were in the past. This is good for public safety.\n\u201cThe performance of the CRCs is too often deeply disappointing. That is why we have stepped in to end contracts early and invested an extra \u00a322m a year in services for offenders on release.\u201d\nAlthough the MoJ has set out a new strategy \u2013 which will reduce the number of aligned probation areas in England to 10 \u2013 the report noted it carried risks because offender management will still be split.\nIt also pointed out the risk of providers withdrawing services or failing outright in light of the collapse of Working Links, which owned three CRCs, last month. In the aftermath of the announcement, union bosses condemned Grayling\u2019s \u201cdisastrous privatisation programme\u201d.\nProbation union Napo\u2019s general secretary, Ian Lawrence, said: \u201cNot only have the CRCs been unable to deliver services, the NPS also has significant failings.\n\u201cStaff shortages have resulted in unmanageable workloads across the board,\u201d he added.\n\u201cA [Transforming Rehabilitation] mark 2 will not resolve the issue of the first reform programme and will only perpetuate the ongoing risks and issues we have seen over the last four years.\u201d\nBetween January 2015 and September 2018, offenders on short sentences as a percentage of everyone who was recalled to prison rose from 3% to 36%.\nThough the NPS performed better than CRCs, the NAO added that it had been constrained by severe staff shortages and high workloads.\nA probation officer, who wished to remain anonymous to protect his identity from his employer, said he believed the NAO\u2019s comments were \u201can understatement\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThere are staff shortages everywhere and poor retention of new staff due to rock-bottom morale.\u201d\nThe NAO has called for the MoJ to publish a cross-government strategy to explain how it will work with other bodies to reduce reoffending and develop a plan to manage the winding-up of existing contracts.",

The concept for the very first Ernie was created by Tommy Flowers, builder of the codebreaking Colossus during the second world war and regarded as one of the giants of early computing alongside Alan Turing.\nWhen the postmaster general, Ernest Marples, gave the go-ahead for the first premium bond prize draws (NS&I insists it was a myth that the machine was named after him), the top prize was \u00a31,000 compared with the \u00a31m jackpots paid out today. But even the \u00a31,000 was considered controversial, with critics such as Harold Wilson concerned that it was a form of gambling rather than saving.\nErnie 2 (1973-88) was designed to look like one of the sets from the James Bond movie Goldfinger, and churned through bonds worth at the time a total of \u00a31bn. Today, the value of premium bonds issued has soared to \u00a379.6bn.\nThe latest Ernie has been developed a long way from Bletchley Park. It has been built by ID Quantique (IDQ), a Swiss company founded in 2001 by four scientists from the University of Geneva who anticipated the impact of quantum physics on information technology. It has received several rounds of funding from the South Korean telecommunications giant SK Telecom.\nSince they first began operating, the five Ernies have generated the numbers for more than 432m prizes totalling \u00a319.2bn, and created 406 millionaires.",

        "content": "Everton seek an elusive derby win, tiring Spurs encourage Arsenal, Rodgers returns to Watford and Dyche eyes safety\nEasy to forget after Virgil van Dijk sliced a woeful shot into the sky, Jordan Pickford flapped and Divock Origi plundered the most ludicrous goal in Merseyside derby history \u2013 step aside, Sandy Brown \u2013 but Everton should have won at Anfield in December. Yerry Mina missed an early close-range header; Alisson made a point-blank save from Andr\u00e9 Gomes; Joe Gomez was forced to hook the rebound off the line. Had any of those gone in \u2026 but it ended how it ended, and collective confidence crashed through the floor. Spooky timing, then, that Everton put in their best performance since then at Cardiff midweek. That should provide succour and the belief to go at their arch rivals again, in the hope of reward this time. Especially as the in-form, two-goal Gylfi Sigurdsson has so often before been a thorn in Liverpool\u2019s side. Can the Iceland international \u2013 who has scored against them four times during spells at Reading, Swansea and Everton \u2013 inspire his current side to a first derby win since Roy Hodgson was in town? SM\nPerhaps we can spare ourselves the twisting in knots about power balances in north London and just enjoy the fact that Saturday\u2019s derby is set up deliciously. Arsenal and their fans are, of course, up and down like a fiddler\u2019s elbow: two decent home wins mean they travel to Wembley with spirits relatively high and they hold genuine hope of narrowing the gap with Tottenham to a mere point. If both teams were at full throttle Spurs would win, but Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side have been curiously lacklustre in slipping to successive away defeats in the past week, and if the manager cannot put a finger on why then their problems may worsen. Being outbattled by Burnley was one thing; making Chelsea look like the side that had enjoyed an extra day\u2019s rest on Wednesday was something else and you wonder whether a little mental tiredness might be creeping in. In both games everything seemed to take Tottenham\u2019s players that split-second too long; is there a danger that a squad whose core has played so much football over the past 18 months is tapering off? Arsenal, and perhaps even a perked-up Mesut \u00d6zil, will look to examine the theory thoroughly. NA\nSouthampton should have beaten Manchester United at St Mary\u2019s in December. They were two up by the 20-minute mark, coasting, but then suffered some rank bad luck, United summoning up some resistance and showing a little backbone, an extremely rare occurrence during that grim period when Jos\u00e9 was preoccupied with his endgame. What were the chances? United are a totally different proposition now under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, but Southampton\u2019s recent record at Old Trafford is better than many might think. A goalless draw last season, victories in 2015 and 2016, just the one loss since 2013. United are under strength, and Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s amazing unbeaten league run has to end at some point, so while victory for Saints would admittedly register as a shock, it would be far from a seismic one. SM\nPresumably there will be no need to scan the Vicarage Road crowd for \u201cfraud\u201d banners when Brendan Rodgers walks out there on Sunday, but there is still some circularity in the fact that his return to English management takes place where it all began. Rodgers was not especially popular when, in 2009, he jumped ship from Watford to their then better-off Championship rivals Reading a week after professing his commitment to the club. The fact he had dragged them out of the relegation zone the previous season tempered some of the rancour but that situation, coupled with his swift departure from Celtic, suggests Rodgers has always had one eye on what might best advance his cause. Not that there is anything wrong with that; Rodgers will be hoping, though, that he lasts rather longer at Leicester than the six months he spent at the Madejski Stadium and at first glance he inherits a group of players that should not find his preferred brand of football too taxing. How they will fare against this season\u2019s Watford side \u2013 fresh from a five-goal away haul and a five-goal away hiding in the space of five days \u2013 is anyone\u2019s guess but instinctively it seems that he may have found a place where he can stick around. NA\nWith one trophy in the bag and three more to be competed for, the fixtures in the last few months of the season will start to stack up for Manchester City. This run of Premier League games \u2013 the win over West Ham on Wednesday, Saturday\u2019s trip to Bournemouth and the following weekend\u2019s home match against Watford \u2013 should theoretically be the time for Pep Guardiola to rotate his squad to ensure the top men are as fresh as possible for more strident challenges ahead. However, against the Hammers Guardiola was forced to smash glass and retrieve a pair of emergency wingers in the shape of Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva, because Leroy San\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez weren\u2019t up to snuff. \u201cWe needed a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe arrived in the positions of the wingers and we didn\u2019t finish what we created.\u201d City need the likes of San\u00e9 and Mahrez to be reliable, but the likes of San\u00e9 and Mahrez need to perform for their own benefit too. NM\nTwo freshly promoted teams here, whose experiences this season upon returning to the big time have been markedly different. Wolves have got the punditocracy cooing with their progressive stylings, and they\u2019re a fair shout to end the campaign as Best Of The Rest (seventh place being a thing now, apparently). Cardiff by contrast are sullied with a meat-and-potatoes reputation and have struggled to stay out of the drop zone since the get-go. Only one winner, some may think. But Cardiff beat Wolves in Wales in November, Junior Hoilett completing a turnaround victory with one of the goals \u2013 the goal? \u2013 of the season so far. Cardiff also won this fixture last season in the Championship. Those results form part of an overall excellent recent record against Wolves, the Bluebirds winning five of the past seven meetings. How precious it would be for 18th-placed Cardiff to keep that run going? SM\nTwitter: follow us at @guardian_sport\nFacebook: like our football and sport pages\nInstagram: our favourite photos, films and stories\nYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels\nA game against Fulham \u2013 poor, terrible, manager-less Fulham \u2013 should not be considered much of a test for Chelsea but it is, and not just because of the derby factor. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side have regained their composure and dignity following the win against Tottenham but things could easily spiral out of control again should they lose, or even draw, at Craven Cottage on Sunday. As such, the visitors will need to repeat the togetherness they displayed against Spurs \u2013 and indeed for much of the Carabao Cup final \u2013 as well as deliver the ruthlessness required in attack to secure all three points. Then, of course, there is the goalkeeper - who does Sarri pick? From the outside, at least, it feels like an easy choice: Stick with Willy. SN\nIn one sense, the fact Fulham and Huddersfield are so far adrift of safety makes the battle to avoid the final relegation place more intense. Everyone from 13th to 18th is \u2013 with the strange exception of freefalling Brighton \u2013 picking up wins here and there, meaning the picture can change in one weekend. Both Burnley (18 points from their past 10 games) and Palace (14 from 10) seem in decent enough nick to be comfortable at the season\u2019s end, despite midweek defeats. But if either side loses at Turf Moor they could find themselves back in the mire, perhaps only one more reverse from severe danger. It makes this meeting akin to a six-pointer and Burnley will expect a return to the intensity that shocked Tottenham last week. Sean Dyche\u2019s achievement in coaxing his side back to their old levels and out of a truly dire-looking situation should not be underestimated: it is tremendously hard to do and many managers do not even get the chance. Another big effort here can put them within tantalising reach of finishing the job and, perhaps, a feat on a par with anything Dyche has managed with the Clarets. NA\nFor Chris Hughton it is time to stick on Think Twice by Celine Dion and listen to the first line of the pre-chorus. \u201cThis is getting serious,\u201d sings the Canadian warbler, and for Brighton it really is. Five defeats and a draw from their past six league games leaves Hughton\u2019s men just two places and two points above the relegation zone. They need to stop the rot and have the perfect chance to do so this weekend given bottom-place Huddersfield are the visitors to the Amex Stadium. But after their win over Wolves, this suddenly feels like a dangerous fixture for the hosts. They simply must win, however, and can take heart from the fact they have scored in each of their past four games in all competitions. SN\nFor a while back there, these two famous old clubs looked in a spot of trouble. West Ham had lost their first four fixtures of the campaign and were rock bottom, while Newcastle weren\u2019t in much better nick, having picked up only one point from the first 12 on offer. Season-long relegation battles were mentioned in dispatches. But it\u2019s not quite panned out like that, two top-drawer managers turning things around to the extent that both sides are now relatively comfortable in mid-table. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team trounced the Toon 3-0 during their December hot streak, but Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side have grown in confidence since the turn of the year, and Newcastle won at the London Stadium last time around. The outcome may depend on which breakout midfield star stamps their personality on proceedings: Declan Rice or Miguel Almir\u00f3n? With both sides able to relax a little and play rather than scrap, it could be good fun finding out. SM",

But his decision to back the cardinal after he was convicted of child sexual abuse this week has cost his employer dearly, both in ad dollars and reputation.\nWhen Bolt announced he would be talking about his serious misgivings about the guilty verdict on The Bolt Report on Tuesday night, Sky News Australia took the unprecedented step of stripping all advertising from the show.\nTONIGHT: We speak with some top legal experts about the conviction of Cardinal George Pell.

Advertisers on the Bolt Report in the days leading up to Tuesday were Ford, Coles, Audi, Ikea, Jenny Craig, Coca-Cola, Budget Rent a Car, Audi and dozens more. Many of them had already been targeted by social media activist group Sleeping Giants Oz for appearing on Sky After Dark programs in general and Bolt in particular. Some advertisers, such as pool company Poolwerx and builders Hotondo Homes, responded to the activism by removing their ads from the after-6pm lineup on the pay TV channel.\n\u201cSky News is committed to providing a platform for robust debate and discussion and is not afraid to tackle confronting and controversial issues,\u201d a spokeswoman from Sky told Weekly Beast.\n\u201cSky News recognised that the controversial topic of George Pell\u2019s conviction to be covered by one of its highest-rating commentators may have presented an environment that left advertisers open to campaigns by activists.\n\u201cA proactive decision was made to replace advertisements during Tuesday night\u2019s program.\u201d\nTHANK YOU @poolwerx for taking a stand to remove your ads from the Bolt Report we hope this extends to all the programs broadcast across the after 6pm offerings.#Auspol #AdShame #SkyNAD https://t.co/fMWTr4u42o\nThe editor of the Herald Sun, Damon Johnston, who published several Bolt posts in support of Pell this week, told us he hadn\u2019t received a single complaint from an advertiser about Bolt.\nWhile the Pell conviction has now been widely reported, as many as 100 journalists are still facing the threat of a charge of contempt of court \u2013 and could face possible jail terms \u2013 over reporting of the Pell trial.\nBefore the suppression order was lifted on Tuesday, the story of Pell\u2019s conviction had already spread far and wide. Analysis by Australian media monitoring firm Streem found no fewer than 144 global news sources had reported the guilty verdict within 24 hours of Pell\u2019s conviction on 11 December.\nAll the reports were all accessible to Australians via search or social media.\nThe Streem analysis also found a large spike in Google search data for \u201chigh-profile Australian convicted\u201d after a number of local sources including the Herald Sun and the Daily Telegraph published front-page stories referencing the fact there was a major case they couldn\u2019t report.\nJonathan Holmes may have moved on from Media Watch, but he\u2019s still an active media watcher, and a keen observer of the public broadcaster in particular. The former ABC host has written an essay which will be published next week by Melbourne University Press in the Little Books on Big Ideas series.\nThe 10,000-word essay examines why audiences are deserting TV and radio as well as political interference at the ABC. He also talks to 7.30 political editor Laura Tingle, who reveals the pressure on staff to report without fear or favour when the critics \u2013 here\u2019s looking at you Chris Kenny \u2013 are waiting to pounce.\n\u201cThe ABC should be the ultimate body that reports without fear or favour, that is beyond the reach of commercial interests, of political interests, and is there to tell stories \u2013 not just political stories \u2013 but Australian stories, and to reflect an Australian voice,\u201d Tingle says in the book.\nThere is no bigger fan of Jordan Peterson than the Australian\u2019s Caroline Overington, as we mentioned here last week. Having written many articles on the Canadian psychologist in recent years, Overington was keen to meet him and managed to get into the green room at Q&A on Monday night by attending as a guest of panellist Catherine McGregor.\nCuriously, Q&A chose to name the episode \u201cJordan Peterson destroys Q&A\u201d when it uploaded it on YouTube. Clips of highlights from the show were similarly named like this in homage to titles of popular videos such as Jordan Peterson destroys Cathy Newman on free speech. Unfortunately the title may also have attracted Peterson fans and trolls who are taking great delight in attacking fellow Q&A panelists Terri Butler and Van Badham.\nHey @jordanbpeterson it might be time to lay down a 13th rule for those who consider you to be their saviour: \u201cDon\u2019t be vile.\u201dEnjoy your time as a guest in Australia. #auspol pic.twitter.com/MmYfy9fzpr\nPeterson was surprised \u2013 as were many of us \u2013 when Milo Yiannopoulos asked him a video question on the show. Yiannopoulos criticised Peterson for staying silent on culture war issues \u2013 such as US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh and the \u201cinnocent\u201d Covington boys.\nAt least we now know that when it comes to a battle between these two rightwing provocateurs, Andrew Bolt comes down on the side of Yiannopoulos. Bolt wrote that he too was disappointed in Peterson and accused him of throwing Milo \u201cunder the bus\u201d.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s when character counts \u2013 when the mob attacks,\u201d Bolt wrote. \u201cPeterson has too often retreated.\u201d\nThe famous theme song to Australia\u2019s longest-running TV soap and successful overseas export, Neighbours, has a starring role in the 2019 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

Transfers can be overridden by the minister on security grounds.\nBut on Thursday Dutton said it would result in the displacement of Australians seeking medical care.\n\u201cPeople who need medical services are going to be displaced from those services, because if you bring hundreds and hundreds of people from Nauru and Manus down to our country, they are going to go into the health network, let\u2019s be frank about it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Australians who are in waiting lines at public hospitals kicked off those waiting lines because people from Nauru and Manus are now going to access those health services.\u201d\nThe independent MP Kerryn Phelps said only about 70 people were likely to need emergency transfer and accused Dutton of running a scare campaign.\nHome Affairs Minister @PeterDutton_MP on asylum seekers: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people at hospitals missing out on medical services because people are taking it from Nauru and Manus.

Exceptions are only allowed with the permission of the cabinet. Under the new law, registered health practitioners and services are banned from conducting telemedicine or aiding, colluding or abetting a Nauruan resident to conduct telemedicine.\n\u201cNo person including the hospital, a health practitioner or a health service provider shall act in any manner whatsoever, at the request or opinion of any health and medical service provider from outside the jurisdiction of the republic, who intends to or renders health and medical services by telemedicine contrary to these regulations,\u201d it said.\nThe new law comes just weeks after MSF launched its own telehealth service in an effort to resume treating its patients after the Nauru government kicked it off the island last year.\nThe executive director of MSF Australia, Paul McPhun, said the new regulations were clearly designed to obstruct the possibility of developing \u201cmeaningful referral pathways for emergency patients\u201d.\nHe said it would be \u201cunethical\u201d for MSF to continue treating its patients under the new circumstances, and had to suspend its service.\n\u201cThese new regulations constitute yet another major obstruction to the provision of independent medical care on the island. The decision diminishes access to mental healthcare for Nauruan, refugee and asylum seeker patients alike,\u201d McPhun said.\nMore than 40 people on Nauru had contacted MSF seeking to resume their treatment in the past fortnight.\nMSF said 30% of its 208 refugee patients had attempted suicide, and 30% of its Nauruan patients \u201cappeared to have been neglected in terms of medical care, mainly due to a lack of available mental healthcare prior to MSF\u2019s arrival\u201d.\n\u201cWe are acutely concerned for our former patients,\u201d McPhun said. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know how much more these people can take.\u201d\nThe new regulations, combined with other recently passed laws that banned overseas medical referrals by any doctor other than those at the Nauruan hospital, threaten to derail the intended process of the medevac bill, which is also facing numerous other hurdles.\nThe government has not yet appointed people to the independent medical panel established by the medevac bill, despite receiving nominations, the Australian reported on Friday.\nAnd the government is also maintaining it will send sick people to Christmas Island before mainland Australia, despite Christmas Island having little capacity to treat serious cases.",

Her quick reaction not just showing the mantra of \u201cteam first\u201d, but also her support for her deputy, and the new leader on the field in her absence.\nEarlier in the week, the new Matildas boss told media how the decision to make Kerr his on-field exemplar was a simple one: \u201cShe\u2019s a leader, she\u2019s fearless, she\u2019s very important to this team\u201d. For the long-time Socceroos assistant, Kerr\u2019s influence reminded him of Tim Cahill \u2013 a star built as much from raw talent as from hard work, discipline and self-belief.\nIt\u2019s a mutual appreciation society, with Kerr\u2019s comments of praise for the Matildas\u2019 first week under Milicic more than just the standard platitudes encouraged by FFA HQ about a clean slate or new environment. In references to the \u201cfun\u201d environment inside camp and the joy at \u201cplaying freely\u201d the shadow of previous criticisms sneaks through. Under his predecessor, Alen Stajcic, the demands for constant improvement had long tipped into negativity; the desire to control the atmosphere surrounding the team had become stultifying.\nOn the touchline, Milicic cut a calm figure \u2013 there was no ranting, no raving \u2013 his demeanour more suiting a veteran of fifty games, not a new coach in charge of his first fixture. It was a calmness and patience that transferred to his players, with the Matildas showing level heads as they went about breaking down a New Zealand defence bolstered by the return of the imperious Abby Erceg.\nKerr has already spoken publicly of the quiet belief that Milicic has in his principles and standards \u2013 and in their approach, the Matildas showed the influence of the Ange Postecoglou vision for Australian football.\n\u201cThese girls are very good footballers,\u201d said Milicic at the post-game press conference, \u201cand I think that\u2019s the Australian way: we want to dominate possession, we want the opposition to chase.\u201d When journalists noted that his side played exclusively out from the back, Milicic rejoined without hesitation: \u201cOf course \u2013 because that\u2019s controlled possession \u2013 we want the ball, because that\u2019s how our players enjoy themselves.\u201d\nIn contrast with the \u201cdeath or glory\u201d approach of Postecoglou\u2019s 2015 World Cup team that almost upset more-vaunted opponents, the Netherlands and Chile, but saw them well-beaten by Spain, the first glance at the Milicic-era Matildas suggests a little more circumspection.\nThere were no bombing fullbacks, with Catley and Ellie Carpenter observing their defensive duties ahead of their offensive contributions \u2013 and the midfield three of Elise Kellond-Knight, Tameka Butt and Emily Van Egmond showed balance and a vigilance against the counter-attack not always displayed by Postecoglou\u2019s Socceroos.\nAnd despite the conscious elevation of Kerr as the talisman for the team \u2013 evident in the early attempts by teammates to unleash the striker recently voted in the top-three female players in the world \u2013 that the goals eventually came from players not heralded as the \u201cbig names\u201d inside the squad, Emily Gielnik and Hayley Raso, speaks to a new ethos of egalitarianism within the squad.\n\u201cI said the first day we got into camp: this is the national team,\u201d Milicic explained post-game. \u201cThe only guarantee I give anyone is three games, so everyone is going to get an opportunity \u2013 every field player will get game time in these [Cup of Nations] games.\u201d\nAmy Harrison, a player not selected in Milicic\u2019s original 23 but drafted in following injury to Chloe Logarzo, was handed thirty minutes in the vital No 10 role in place of Van Egmond. She rewarded her coach\u2019s show of faith immediately, putting on a fine ball to find Raso for the Matildas\u2019 second goal. It was a bold change, but Milicic\u2019s belief proved well-founded.\nAlex Chidiac only entered the fray in the 78th minute after injury to Tameka Butt, suggesting perhaps a bigger role in game two or three for the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid midfielder. Instead of an over-reliance on trusted senior players \u2013 the first substitutes of the Milicic era were telling. Off came Kerr, Van Egmond, Kellond-Knight and Kennedy. The leading lights were removed leading only 1-0, but the challengers came in and repaid their coach\u2019s faith with aplomb.\nWith remarkable depth within the Australian ranks \u2013 don\u2019t forget this is a side awaiting the return of former AFC women\u2019s player of the year Katrina Gorry, experienced striker Kyah Simon and the rapidly improving Logarzo. Nobody\u2019s place is secured. Except perhaps for Kerr.\nThe on-field leader and off-field joker already appears the perfect complement for her new boss, whose reputation for work ethic and professionalism is countered by his expressed desire to find a beach-side camp for his team ahead of France 2019 so his players can relax. It\u2019s a promising double act, and an essential dynamic for a side that already appears to have gone someway to retaining its swagger and self-belief.\nComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

        "content": "The prime minister is facing his first major scandal, with claims of political pressure to prosecutions\nCanada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is facing the biggest political scandal of his administration. The affair centres around allegations that his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was improperly pressured by some of his closest advisers to prevent the prosecution of a large Canadian engineering firm over accusations of fraud and bribery. Thus far, the scandal has been politically costly; Gerald Butts, a longtime friend of Trudeau\u2019s, and his closest adviser, resigned two weeks ago. Wilson-Raybould had quit a week earlier, within hours of the prime minister denying she was unhappy. A handful of polls are showing the scandal is politically unpopular for the governing Liberals \u2013 which is worrying for them, given there is a federal election in October.\nSNC-Lavalin, based in Montreal, is accused of paying C$48m worth of bribes in Libya to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s family, in order to secure lucrative contracts. The bribery is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2011. If found guilty, the company would be barred from bidding on federal projects for a decade. SNC-Lavalin employs nearly 50,000 people worldwide, with 3,400 in Quebec.\nCompany executives have been lobbying for a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d, which in effect allows them to pay a fine in lieu of a criminal prosecution, with no ban on bidding for contracts. But federal prosectors have decided to pursue a trial.\nThis is where the scandal is centred: the prime minister and his aides, along with the finance minister, have been accused of pressing Wilson-Raybould to intervene and asking prosecutors to accept a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould declined to override the judgment of her top legal team.\nIn searing testimony in front of parliament\u2019s justice committee, Wilson-Raybould detailed \u201cconsistent and sustained\u201d efforts to change her mind. Despite repeated assertions by Wilson-Raybould that she would not bend, she told a justice committee on Wednesday the pressure intensified \u2013 and included \u201cveiled threats\u201d by aides that she was on course for a clash with the prime minister. She said that while it was proper for ministers and their staff to consult her about protecting jobs, it was inappropriate for her to make decisions based on \u201cpartisan political considerations\u201d. Her testimony also marked the first public assertion that Trudeau lobbied her \u2013 to the point that she felt obliged to warn him what he was asking was improper.\nShe also told parliamentarians she suspected her refusal to back down lay behind her move to the Veterans\u2019 Affairs portfolio in a mid-January cabinet reshuffle.\nTrudeau has not denied that he and his team spoke to Wilson-Raybould and her staff about SNC-Lavalin. He says all of their discussions were respectful and within the bounds of the rules. On Thursday, he reiterated his belief that as prime minister, it is his job and duty to protect the jobs of Canadians \u2013 likely a reference to the potential for job losses in the event of a conviction.\nThe leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, has called on Trudeau to resign \u2013something Trudeau has rejected. Other political leaders have called for more investigations into the affair \u2013 and the country\u2019s ethics commissioner is investigating. But at the justice committee hearing on Wednesday, members of Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party appeared as unified; there have been no high-profile shows of public support for Wilson-Raybould within the party since Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony was on the front page of every major paper in the country, with most running large, dramatic photos of the defiant former attorney general. \u201cI Said \u2018No\u2019, My Mind Had Been Made Up,\u201d said the National Post. \u201cWilson-Raybould Speaks Her Truth,\u201d said the Toronto Star. \u201cWilson-Raybould points accusing finger at PM,\u201d said the Vancouver Sun. And the Globe and Mail, which broke the story, ran with the headline: \u201cAn effort to politically interfere.\u201d\nA number of figures have requested to testify before the justice committee, including Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s former adviser and Michael Wernick, the country\u2019s top public servant. Both were present in many of the discussions \u2013 and both have publicly stated previously they did nothing wrong. The prime minister has also said he would consider the future of Wilson-Raybould in the party. While the scandal will likely not damage him in Quebec, where his support of SNC-Lavalin is viewed positively, it could prove damaging in the rest of the country.\n This article was amended on 4 March 2018 to include a reference to Wilson-Raybould\u2019s change of cabinet portfolio.",

Among those the committee will call in for testimony are Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, as well as the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\n\u201cAll you have to do is follow the transcript. If there are names that were mentioned or records that were mentioned during the hearing, we want to take a look at all of that,\u201d Cummings told reporters.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to follow the facts and then whatever comes out of it, fine,\u201d he added.\n\u201cBut what we\u2019re about is just making sure that government is accountable, and this administration, this branch is accountable.\u201d\nAdam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, separately announced on Thursday that the former Trump associate Felix Sater will come before his panel on 14 March.\nSchiff\u2019s comments came after Cohen testified before the intelligence committee behind closed doors for eight hours.\nSater, a Russia-born business executive who has a past as an American spy tracking terrorists and members of the mob, worked with Cohen on negotiations around the construction of a Trump Tower Moscow project during the 2016 election.\nIn his public testimony before the oversight committee on Wednesday, Cohen said it was Sater who suggested giving the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a $50m penthouse at the top of the potential building.\nAlthough the plan did not come to fruition, Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for crimes that included lying to Congress about the duration and timeline of discussions over the Trump Tower Moscow project.\nThose negotiations are now a central focus for Democrats in Congress, who have vowed to use their newly minted House majority to more aggressively pursue investigations against the president and his inner circle.\nCohen also told lawmakers on Wednesday that he had briefed Ivanka and Trump Jr on the Trump Tower project approximately 10 times, contradicting the Trump family members\u2019 earlier claims.\nTrump Jr testified to the Senate intelligence committee that he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the project, while Ivanka said in an interview earlier this month she knew \u201cliterally almost nothing\u201d about it.\nLawmakers are further interested in following up on Cohen\u2019s testimony around the hush money payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels to silence her from speaking out about her alleged affair with Trump.\nAppearing before the oversight committee on Wednesday, Cohen publicly entered as evidence two $35,000 checks from Trump\u2019s personal bank account that he said were reimbursement for the money he paid to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. One of the checks was signed by the president himself, while the other was signed by Trump Jr and Weisselberg.\nWeisselberg, the Trump Organization CFO, is widely known to be the gatekeeper to Trump\u2019s finances. Having worked for the family for more than 40 years, he is said to have intimate and perhaps unparalleled knowledge of Trump\u2019s financial arrangements.\nUnder questioning from Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday, Cohen acknowledged that Trump inflated his assets to insurance companies. He further noted that Weisselberg was aware that Trump had potentially committed insurance and tax fraud.\nWeisselberg was granted immunity last year to testify before a federal grand jury in New York relating to the investigation into the hush money payments.\nGabrielle Canon contributed to this article",

The summit\u2019s collapse \u201cwill put a damper on the inter-Korean peace process pursued by the South Korean government\u201d, the newspaper said in an editorial, citing now-dashed hopes that the partial lifting of sanctions would have allowed Seoul to restart joint economic and tourism projects with the North.\n\u201cYet what this reality confirms is that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d it added. \u201cIf the North would have won by only offering to dismantle enrichment facilities at Yongbyon, they could very well have reversed this course as they have done in the past. Pyongyang would retain its status as a de facto nuclear state while the South would be left hanging.\u201d\nKCNA said only that Kim and Trump \u201chighly appreciated\u201d the opportunity to meet again, nine months after their first summit, and welcomed the \u201cremarkable progress\u201d they had made since, according to KCNA Watch.\n\u201cThey had a constructive and candid exchange of their opinions over the practical issues arising in opening up a new era of the improvement of the DPRK-US relations on the basis of progress,\u201d the agency said, referring to the North by its official title the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nThe article ran alongside photos of Trump and Kim on the first two pages of Friday\u2019s Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party of Korea \u2013 an indication that state media intend to portray the meeting as another diplomatic success for Kim.\nHow did North Korea cover the unexpected end to yesterday\u2019s #HanoiSummit? The meeting dominates the first two pages of the Rodong Sinmun, which gave a largely positive review, calling it an event of \u201cgreat significance in building mutual trust.\u201d https://t.co/c0AvaHxcVy pic.twitter.com/PD1oQsnyM4\nThe tone of North Korean media coverage has been generally positive all week. On Wednesday, the Rodong Sinmun devoted its entire front page to Kim\u2019s arrival in Hanoi the previous day, accompanied by several colour photographs.\nIt gave similar prominence to the leaders\u2019 greeting and dinner on Wednesday, when the mood music pointed towards a more detailed agreement than the vague statement they signed in Singapore last June.\nBut on Friday, KCNA made only opaque references to the challenges ahead, noting that Kim and Trump would have to overcome \u201cinevitable hardships and difficulties\u201d that it attributed to seven decades of \u201cantagonism and confrontation\u201d between the two countries.\nThe agency also made no mention of comments by the country\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, who has disputed Trump\u2019s account of the talks, claiming that North Korea had only demanded partial sanctions relief in return for closing its Yongbyon nuclear complex and not, as the president had claimed, an end to all sanctions.",

        "content": "Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage, New York\nJohn Logan\u2019s somber tale of a comics nerd living next door to a superhero is a sweet but slight tale of grief and urban alienation\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost in a big city. If you\u2019re the semi-creepy guy in 4-B hoping no one clocks you as an alien life form dispatched to Earth to save humans from peril, that\u2019s probably an advantage. In Superhero, at Second Stage, Oscar-nominated playwright and screenwriter John Logan, whose stage work includes Red and Peter and Alice, and Tom Kitt, whose music in Next to Normal won him a Tony, have fancified a sweet, slight musical about grief and urban alienation with occasional flashes of blammo!\nComics nerd Simon (Kyle McArthur) lives with his literature professor mom, Charlotte (Kate Baldwin) in some unnamed metropolis. They\u2019re both mourning the loss of Mitch, Simon\u2019s dad, who died two years ago in a mysterious accident. Simon likes to draw superheroes, an obvious coping mechanism. (Beowulf Boritt\u2019s set builds the proscenium into a series of panels.) He retains the childlike belief that maybe real heroes exist, a belief that\u2019s unexpectedly strengthened when he sees his taciturn neighbor Jim (Bryce Pinkham) dematerialize into a burst of light and whoosh from the building\u2019s roof.\n\u201cI\u2019m from another planet,\u201d Jim explains later. \u201cOK, it sounds crazy when I say it out loud.\u201d\nAnother musical might keep us guessing as to whether Jim is really super or just a reserved dude with possible schizophrenia, whether Simon is really an accidental sidekick or just a messed-up kid who should really be in therapy. Tom Kitt\u2019s earlier musical, Next to Normal, played some of these hallucinatory games. But this show is basically unshakable on the subject of Jim\u2019s extraterrestrial origin. It\u2019s more interested in whether a capeless crusader can rescue a heartbroken family. It turns out of course the real power isn\u2019t superspeed or superstrength. It\u2019s love. Wait, was that a spoiler?\nMaybe the superhero stuff is a little silly, but silliness is not the enemy here. If anything, it saves Superhero from sounding like a softer echo of so many other unhappy family stories. (The echoes of Dear Evan Hansen, another tale of an awkward depressive teenager and the mom who can\u2019t reach him, are especially strong.) Can we maybe acknowledge that when it comes to that whole happy/ unhappy family thing, Tolstoy was very wrong?\nStill, the rescue only goes so far. Too many of Kitt\u2019s songs, outfitted with somewhat sentimental orchestrations by Kitt and Michael Starobin, do the same work. They\u2019re nearly all ballads, charting emotional micro-climates inch by inch. Kitt writes beautifully for his anguished characters, shaping the lyrics to each distinct voice. But there are only so many this-is-what-I\u2019m-feeling-right-now-this-second songs a musical can hold, especially when the plot is so wispy and the conclusion, that maybe mother and son can work things out if they only talk to each other, so foregone.\nNon-stop quiet ballads liberate Superhero from much of what makes musicals embarrassing, but also from much of what makes them fun. The direction by Jason Moore is thoughtful and the musical staging by Lorin Latarro beautifully fluid. And yet would it be so bad to have a tap number? Instead the mood remains low-key somber and Logan\u2019s book takes Jim and his powers so seriously that there\u2019s no opportunity for wonder or playfulness. Pretty much the only jokes are about mini golf, fruit so low it scrapes the ground.\nPinkham has a lovely, chilling tenor and if the musical rests too heavily on Simon\u2019s puny shoulders, McArthur is likable, especially in his zero-to-hero-to-zero song I\u2019ll Save the Girl. (If the other actors are pleasant enough, their characters are comic book thin.) But this musical mostly exists as an exquisite showcase for Kate Baldwin, an actor so luminous and so specific that she makes great singing seem effortless. Is that a superpower? It should be.",

        "content": "Harriet Grahame recommends a summit consider \u2018decriminalising personal use of drugs\u2019 to reduce their harm\nA state coroner has recommended a complete reframing of drug policy in New South Wales and says the government should consider decriminalising drug use.\nOn Friday the deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame, released findings from an inquest held into opioid-related deaths. The special inquest examined the deaths of six people from opioids in May 2016.\nGrahame recommended the government hold a drug summit, bringing together health, addiction, drug law reform and law enforcement experts focused on \u201cminimising harm to users, their families and the community\u201d.\nMost significantly, she said the summit should give \u201cfull and genuine consideration\u201d to ways of reducing drug overdoses in NSW, including \u201cdecriminalising personal use of drugs, as a mechanism to reduce the harm caused by drug use\u201d.\nAmid a suite of recommendations she also said the NSW health department should conduct \u201cfurther research\u201d into the use of medical cannabis for chronic non-cancer-related pain \u201cas an overdose prevention strategy\u201d.\nGrahame said the health department should consider introducing \u201cadditional venues\u201d for the medically supervised injection of opioids. Currently there is only one injection room in NSW, in Sydney\u2019s King\u2019s Cross.\nHeld across a week in May, with further hearings in August, the inquest examined the way addictive painkillers such as fentanyl are prescribed in NSW and the dramatic increase in opioid-related overdose deaths in the past decade.\nIn her findings, Grahame said the state\u2019s attorney general should consider reclassifying fentanyl \u201cso that it is subject to stricter regulation before it can be supplied\u201d.\nBut she also called for a wider recalibration of the state\u2019s approach to drug policy.\nPointing out that 2016 recorded the highest number of drug deaths in NSW in two decades, Grahame said the current approach to the regulation of drugs \u201cis not working if it is measured either by its ability to prevent drug use or its ability to reduce drug death\u201d.\n\u201cMany of these deaths were caused by a combination of drugs, including prescribed opioids, heroin and benzodiazepines,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf the death rate continues upwards, as it has in the United States, the annual death toll could reach many thousands over the next five years.\u201d\nBut it is Grahame\u2019s comments about the wider decriminalisation of drugs that will cause most debate.\nIn her judgement she pointed to evidence from Dr Nuno Capaz from the Portuguese ministry of health about the decriminalisation of all personal drug use in Portugal.\nDescribing it as \u201ca legislative reform worthy of close scrutiny\u201d, Grahame said the change had \u201conly been successful because it came about with a corresponding massive injection of funds into drug treatment programs of all kinds\u201d.\n\u201cThe point of examining the Portuguese experience is not to suggest that it can be directly transported to the Australian context, but rather to study how a willingness to reframe the entire debate in response to an opiate crisis, with an evidence-based approach, has successfully achieved better overall community outcomes,\u201d she wrote.\nShe also pointed to \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence from the former commissioner of the Australian federal police Mick Palmer that law enforcement efforts to curb drug supply and demand does not \u201cdo any more than scratch the surface\u201d.\n\u201cThere is extensive research to support the view that prohibition policies are rarely successful and are highly likely to cause harm to many in the community,\u201d Grahame wrote.\n\u201cWhere a product is prohibited, but demand remains, it is likely an unregulated and inherently dangerous black market will flourish. When law enforcement intensifies, history shows us that suppliers will create new products that may be more concentrated and more easily transported.\u201d\nThe inquest was centred around six opioid-related deaths in May 2016. Grahame noted that \u201cstatistical spikes\u201d in drug-related deaths are not uncommon because of the \u201cnature of uncontrolled black market supply\u201d.\nHowever, in the case of the opioid-related deaths there was \u201cno simple explanation, such as an unusually strong or contaminated supply\u201d. The aim of the special inquest, she said, was to \u201cgrapple with some of the broader public health and death prevention issues that might arise from the evidence\u201d.\nThe counsel assisting the inquest, Peggy Dwyer, described the inquest as merely a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the scale of opioid-related deaths in the state, which she said were at \u201crecord levels in Australia and internationally\u201d.",

He was a fixture on prime time television at a time when the commercial current affairs shows were taken seriously and often conducted tough interviews with politicians.\nHe was famous for his interviewing skills and rose to prominence over his questioning of the prime minister Harold Holt about the appointment of a new ABC chairman. His 1993 interview with the Liberal party leader, John Hewson, 10 days out from the election has been credited with helping turn the \u201cunlosable\u201d election in Labor\u2019s favour, after Hewson floundered while answering pointed questions from Willesee about the Liberal party\u2019s GST policy.\nHe asked: \u201cIf I buy a birthday cake from a cake shop, and GST is in place, do I pay more or less for that birthday cake?\u201d\nDavid Hurley, former executive producer of A Current Affair, said Willesee was a \u201cbig friendly bear of a man\u201d who was a master of the craft of interviewing.\nHurley said his interview technique became known as \u201cthe Willesee stare\u201d and it would demolish his subjects.\n\u201cHe was the best of the best,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cHe was kind, and modest and lit up a room.\u201d\nVale journalist and broadcaster #MikeWillesee.

It was cancer. The prognosis wasn\u2019t very good. Six to 12 months.\u201d\nWillesee was married three times, first to former Miss Australia, Joan Stanbury, and then to actor and model Carol Brent. He had two children with Stanbury \u2013 Michael and Katie \u2013 and three daughters with Brent \u2013 Amy, Lucy and Jo.\nIn 1999 he married Channel Nine television make-up artist Gordana Poljak and had a son, Rok. The third marriage ended after 11 years.\nFormer media colleagues paid tribute to Willesee above all as a \u201ctough\u201d journalist, who exemplified serious reporting and interviewing on commercial television.\nABC\u2019s news director, Gaven Morris, said Willesee \u201cwas one of the true pioneers of TV journalism in Australia\u201d. Political journalist Paul Bongiorno wrote on Twitter: \u201cMike\u2019s interviewing technique masterful....with a phrase he could undo an obfuscating politician. Few if any have matched his ability to do this. A master of the craft.\u201d\nTough reporter, brilliant documentary maker, successful media entrepreneur, spellbinding interviewer. A man of complex flaws but enormous strengths, including kindness to those starting out. My condolences to the Willesee family.

        "content": "Vladimir Zelenskiy, whose character becomes president in hit TV show, leading polls\nVladimir Zelenskiy may just joke his way to becoming Ukraine\u2019s next leader. A comic actor who plays a teacher who unexpectedly becomes president in a hit Ukrainian TV show after his rant against corrupt politicians goes viral, he is now pitching for the top job in real life and has a 10-point lead in some opinion polls.\nIt is Ukraine\u2019s most unorthodox presidential campaign in history. After announcing his campaign on New Year\u2019s Eve, Zelenskiy has shot into first place by contrasting his screen personality, a genial everyman who speaks in a gravelly bass, with public discontent against the country\u2019s ruling class. His political party and TV show share the same name, Servant of the People.\nOn the stage in Bila Tserkva, a working-class city an hour south of Kyiv, he had the crowd in stitches. \u201cWhy does [Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro] Poroshenko want a second term?\u201d Zelenskiy quipped about the man he wants to replace. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t get a [prison] term.\u201d\nBetween the improv sketches that make up much of the evening\u2019s show from his comedy troupe, he and his co-hosts continued to skewer Ukraine\u2019s ruling class with savage political humour. It felt like a campaign rally in the guise of a revue, and Zelenskiy is scheduled to continue performing right up to election day.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t part of a pre-election campaign,\u201d he said to laughs from an audience of hundreds, some of whom told the Guardian they had been given free tickets to the event. \u201cYou yourselves know what to do.\u201d\nIn Ukraine, where only one president has won re-election since independence in 1991, one of Zelenskiy\u2019s greatest assets may be that he has not been in politics long enough to earn voters\u2019 wrath yet.\nUkrainian politics has turned against the establishment \u2013 perhaps for good reason. Even as the economy has stabilised, inequality and corruption remain rife, utility bills have risen and the afterglow of the 2014 revolution has faded with few prominent corrupt officials jailed.\nAs one adviser to Zelenskiy\u2019s rival Yulia Tymoshenko said: \u201cIf you leave Kyiv and start talking about real wages and living conditions, that doesn\u2019t make you a populist, that makes you a realist.\u201d\nDespite unanswered questions about his own business ties to the powerful oligarch Ihor Kolomoiskyi, whose television channel 1+1 screens his political comedy, Zelenskiy has sought to present himself as a new face in Ukrainian politics running against an entrenched elite.\nHis programme nods to the exhaustion with politics and promises greater direct democracy: a pledge to serve only one term, national referendums on key issues and plans to lift immunity from prosecution for lawmakers, judges, and the president himself. Using a synonym for making arrests, one of his campaign slogans reads: \u201cWhen spring comes, we\u2019ll start planting.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a very high desire to see high-ranking officials, members of the ruling class arrested,\u201d said Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only one doing it, but it does sound more natural coming from him.\u201d\nDmitry Razumkov, a political advisor to Zelenskiy, denied the candidate was a populist. \u201cEveryone is tired of the system and is protesting against it. Zelenskiy is a uniting figure who can break the old system and replace it.\u201d\nBut Zelenskiy\u2019s lack of political experience outside of TV comedy hasled to criticism. A meeting with European ambassadors was a fiasco, several told the Guardian. \u201cTheir response was: is this some kind of joke?\u201d one diplomat said. \u201cSome of his programme looks fine on paper, but when it comes down to it, he can\u2019t actually discuss his policies.\u201d\nHeightened scrutiny has also provoked questions about his company\u2019s earlier business dealings in Russia and his reliance on Kolomoiskyi for access to the airwaves.\nBut this has failed to hinder his rise in the polls, with especially strong support among young voters. Zelenskiy has recently sought to make inroads among Kyiv\u2019s progressive political elite as the 31 March first round draws nearer.\nAivaras Abromavi\u010dius, a former economy minister and one of several prominent reformers who has met Zelenskiy, called him a \u201cgood listener\u201d and \u201cambitious\u201d, but said he was vague on his ties to Kolomoisky and his precise political plans.\n\u201cHe does not seem to have very strong views about most things,\u201d Abromavi\u010dius said. \u201cI see that as an advantage. Those views will be shaped if he becomes president. By someone around him, and the question is by whom. That is the key question.\u201d\nBorn in Kryvyi Rih, a largely Russian-speaking industrial town in the country\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region, Zelenskiy helped build a comedy troupe of childhood and university friends into a multimillion dollar business. Some remain his closest confidants, working as actors and scriptwriters, and occupying key positions on his campaign staff.\n\u201cHe was always the motor to our success,\u201d said Vadim Pereverzev, a childhood friend and writer for Zelenskiy\u2019s Studio Kvartal 95. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one among us who was irreplaceable.\u201d\nHe was not always drawn to politics. Oleksii Blanar, a former colleague who now works for a competing comedy studio, said Zelenskiy had rejected proposals to run for political office in the mid-2000s when the two worked together. Blanar, who voiced support for Poroshenko\u2019s re-election, is sceptical of Zelenskiy\u2019s run.\n\u201cBack then he was regularly being called into politics. He always said no, I don\u2019t want to be a politician,\u201d Blanar said during an interview at a Kyiv cafe. \u201cI believe that he was changed by his new friendships and those around him,\u201d adding that he meant Kolomoisky.\nZelenskiy\u2019s campaign denies that Kolomoiskyi had any influence on his decision to run. None of his colleagues, including campaign staff, said precisely when Zelenskiy began considering his run for president.\nSome, including Kolomoiskyi in a recent television interview, have suggested the idea dates to the 2015 debut of Servant of the People. Zelenskiy is shooting the third series, which is scheduled for broadcast shortly before the first round vote. Opponents are calling the new series an undeclared campaigning tool and demanding a delay in its broadcast.\nZelenskiy has met criticism of his business ties by saying that all television channels in Ukraine are controlled by oligarchs, so his relationship with Kolomoiskyi was necessary to do business.\nHis candidacy has also survived revelations that a business he controlled continued to earn money in Russia after he said he closed it after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Zelenskiy has said he now has exited the business.\nThe frontrunner for now, analysts caution his weak party structure and young support base could leave him vulnerable to more experienced campaigns as election day approaches.\n\u201cI think the original idea was to create a great show, almost a reality show, to create hype,\u201d said Fesenko. \u201cBut now he is a favourite and everyone is discussing him. A lot can happen before the elections, but for now he\u2019s still gaining, there\u2019s a chain reaction of support for Zelenskiy.\u201d",
