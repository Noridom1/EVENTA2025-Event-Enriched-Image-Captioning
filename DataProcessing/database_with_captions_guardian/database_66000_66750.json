        "content": "Greek internationals of vast promise graced both halves of the pitch, but gifts were only sent one way. Liverpool cruised into the fourth round and suggested that, should they fancy it, they have the depth for a serious tilt at their first League Cup win since 2012.\nA relatively experienced side made light work of opponents who are evidently low on morale, repeating the scoreline recorded in the Premier League iteration of this fixture five and-a-half weeks ago.\nKostas Tsimikas stole the show, suggesting again that he is a more than capable deputy for Andy Robertson, and was directly responsible for two goals. But fate hit his compatriot Christos Tzolis, a vaunted 19\u2011year\u2011old who cost Norwich \u00a310m from PAOK last month, rather more cruelly.\nTzolis had been the hosts\u2019 best player during the first half but the records will merely show that, with the interval beckoning, he fluffed a penalty that would have brought them in level. Moreover, it emerged he had not been the designated taker; his attempt to make amends from the rebound resulted in an air kick and, from there, Liverpool would gather breath before pulling clear.\nIn truth none of these occurrences will register in the post-season conversation around Daniel Farke\u2019s dressing room whether or not Norwich, who have lost the first five top-flight games of their latest survival bid, stay in the Premier League. But there is an undercurrent of frustration here, and at such an early stage too. Another comfortable defeat merely augmented it: a half\u2011strength selection received a smattering of boos at full time and Farke badly needs a result at Everton on Saturday if he is to lighten the mood.\n\u201cThe penalty was of course the key moment,\u201d said Farke, who did not mince his words about Tzolis\u2019s moment of hubris. \u201cChristos was not the first on the teamsheet [to take it]. He got greedy. If you do this you have to make sure you score, otherwise you are in trouble. He will never ever do this mistake in his life again, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp has no such concerns. He resisted any temptation to saturate his starting XI with debutants, although the two who began held plenty of interest. The right-back Conor Bradley became Liverpool\u2019s first Northern Irish player since 1954, a fact Klopp rolled off the tongue with relish afterwards; in front of him on the wing, Kaide Gordon was given a highly anticipated bow two weeks shy of his 17th birthday.\nAlthough diminutive, Gordon looked strong and had sights of goal in either half. Bradley will learn from the barge on Dimitris Giannoulis, the third Greece representative on show, that earned Tzolis his shot at parity but otherwise looked composed. A third youngster, the midfielder Tyler Morton, impressed after replacing Naby Ke\u00efta for the second half.\n\u201cThe kids did exceptionally well, I have to say,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cMaybe the biggest surprise was that they could go for 94 or 95 minutes. I\u2019m really happy for them.\u201d\nThe difference in attack was made by more experienced heads. Liverpool took the lead within four minutes when Tsimikas\u2019s outswinging corner was nodded down by Divock Origi, making light of two seemingly featherweight markers, and latched on to by Takumi Minamino. The finish, cracked low through Angus Gunn\u2019s legs, was the forward\u2019s first meaningful touch of the season and set Liverpool fair.\nTsimikas continued to cause danger with a stream of inviting deliveries but Norwich improved and would have merited an equaliser if Tzolis, aiming down the middle but seeing Caoimhin Kelleher save his spot kick with an outstretched leg, had been on point. Pierre Lees-Melou spurned another good chance to level soon after the break and, almost immediately, Curtis Jones released Tsimikas for a deftly-chipped cross that Origi powered beyond Gunn.\nWith 10 minutes left, Minamino foraged through a series of non-existent challenges to squeeze home the third. \u201cIt was important for him and for us,\u201d said Klopp, who was keen to point out a thigh injury has limited Minamino\u2019s opportunities. \u201cHe\u2019s in a really good moment, trained really well and deserved his two goals. Nobody has to worry, Taki will be fine.\u201d\nWhether or not Norwich will be is moot. \u201cThe fact we lost is not a fact I like,\u201d Farke said. At least he will receive no more hard truths from Liverpool for the next few months.",

        "content": "Little likelihood of progress on free-trade agreement as Biden focuses attention elsewhere, say insiders\nBritain\u2019s hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US have all but evaporated barring a dramatic change of heart from Joe Biden, it emerged on Tuesday as Boris Johnson held face-to-face talks in the White House.\nJohnson once regarded a bilateral free trade agreement with the US as a key Brexit win, highlighting the prospects for British exporters unfettered from the EU. But government insiders privately concede that they see little prospect of progress towards a one-to-one deal, as the Biden administration focuses on other priorities.\nWhen Johnson was asked on Tuesday whether he still hoped to strike a free-trade agreement with the US by the time of the next general election, opening the way to lower tariffs and a closer economic relationship, he said \u201cwe\u2019re going as fast as we can\u201d, but declined to confirm whether it could be achieved before 2024.\nWhen the US president was asked about the prospects of a deal as the pair met in the Oval Office, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about trade a little bit today, and we\u2019re going to have to work that through.\u201d\nThe UK is now understood to be considering alternative options, including seeking to join the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal instead of striking a bilateral agreement with Washington.\nA senior government source said: \u201cThere are a variety of different ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US\u2019s court. It takes two to tango.\u201d\nThe government is understood to have made the point to the US that after signing a string of recent bilateral agreements, Britain now has closer trade relations with Canada or Mexico than the US despite the so-called special relationship.\nLater on in the bilateral talks, the pair exchanged gifts. Johnson gave Biden a signed copy of astronaut Tim Peak\u2019s book, Hello, is this Planet Earth?, inscribed by Peake with the message: \u201cI hope this book provides a reminder of what we are fighting to save as our countries battle climate change together\u201d.\nBiden gave the prime minister a framed photograph of them at the Carbis Bay G7 summit earlier this year \u2013 and a White House-branded watch.\nJohnson was keen to showcase the strength of his relationship with Biden on his US trip after a fraught summer in which the UK appeared to be denied key information about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has claimed the US-UK partnership is at its strongest for \u201cdecades\u201d.\nBiden also underlined the importance of ensuring peace in Northern Ireland is not jeopardised by post-Brexit tensions.\n\u201cI feel very strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent an enormous amount of time and effort in the United States. It was a major partisan effort, and I would not like to see \u2013 nor would many of my Republican colleagues \u2013 a change in the Irish accord\u201d.\nSpeaking to US broadcaster NBC on Tuesday, Johnson played down differences with Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal, which led to the Taliban capturing Kabul and the chaotic evacuation.\nAsked if he had been forced to wait 36 hours to speak to Biden directly about the situation in Afghanistan, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t discuss my calls with other leaders but to the best of my recollection we talked very frankly about the whole thing.\u201d\nPressed on whether he agreed with Biden\u2019s decision to set and stick to a date for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, he said: \u201cAmerica has been there for 20 years and it\u2019s a respectable argument to say \u2018enough is enough\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cCould we have done things differently? Perhaps we could.\u201d\nThe foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is travelling with Johnson, said she hoped to link trade and diplomacy more closely in her new role, highlighting the potential for UK jobs from the Aukus security deal announced last week.\nTrade was not among the issues Downing Street highlighted before the discussion between Johnson and Biden, who met in the Oval Office. Instead, the prime minister was expected to raise the climate crisis, Aukus and details of the US\u2019s new travel regime.\nThe UK had appeared blindsided by the travel announcement on Monday, with Johnson warning journalists en route to the US that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold your breath\u201d for developments this week.\nAs he arrived in Washington by train from New York, Johnson welcomed Biden\u2019s announcement of a significant increase in US climate funding for developing countries, raising the prospect that the $100bn (\u00a373bn) target set a decade ago could be reached before the Cop26 summit in November.\nBiden told the UN general assembly that the US would double its contribution, from $5.6bn to $11.2bn. Johnson said the announcement was \u201cgame changing,\u201d and he wanted to see similar levels of ambition from other rich countries.\nThe US and UK have worked closely on the climate but little progress has been made in recent months on deepening trade ties. Biden only appointed a chief agricultural trade negotiator, Elaine Trevino, last week, and has not yet appointed a new ambassador to London. Agriculture would be likely to be a key element of any deal.\nMeeting Kamala Harris, the vice-president, before seeing Biden, the prime minister said there had been \u201creal progress\u201d on trade, citing the lifting of the \u201ccurious\u201d US ban on exports of British beef.\nHe also praised the US decision to double its contribution to climate financing. \u201cToday was a great day for the world, he said. Harris replied: \u201cIt was.\u201d\nJohnson will remain in Washington overnight and meet a string of senior congressional figures on Wednesday, including House speaker Nancy Pelosi, fresh from a visit to the Chorley constituency of her UK counterpart, Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nAfter the scramble to pull out of Afghanistan, Conservative MPs warned the prime minister that bilateral relations with the UK had been allowed to deteriorate since Biden\u2019s election, and urged him to deepen connections with the new White House.",

        "content": "Production at factories in Teesside and Cheshire will resume after government offers financial help\nMinisters have reached a deal to restart carbon dioxide (CO2) production at a factory on Teesside in an effort to ease fears of food shortages.\nThe business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been locked in talks with the US firm CF Industries after it stopped work at its fertiliser plants because of the surge in gas prices.\nIt emerged on Tuesday night that the government will provide \u201climited financial support\u201d for CF Fertilisers\u2019 operating costs for three weeks while the CO2 market adapts to global gas prices.\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the \u201cexceptional short-term arrangement\u201d with the US-owned firm would allow the company to immediately restart operations and produce CO2 at its Billingham plant in Teesside. The firm has another site in Cheshire, which is currently still closed.\nEarlier, Kwarteng suggested that the government could be willing to provide the industry with support to restart after warnings that a shortage of the gas could cause food supply problems.\n\u201cTime is of the essence, and that\u2019s why I spoke to the chief executive, speaking to him twice in the last two days, and we\u2019re hopeful that we can get something sorted today and get the production up and running in the next few days,\u201d he told the BBC.\nIn a sign that taxpayers\u2019 money could be used, Kwarteng said: \u201cIt may come at some cost, we\u2019re still hammering out details, we\u2019re still looking at a plan.\u201d\nThe closure of the fertiliser factories has led to a food production crisis, as food-grade CO2 is a byproduct of production and is used to stun animals for slaughter, as well as in baking and packing meat, dairy and salads.\nBoris Johnson said the government was taking \u201cdirect steps\u201d to safeguard CO2 supplies, although the government has not formally confirmed a deal.\nRetailers and suppliers had given warning on Monday that supermarkets would begin to run short of poultry, pork and some other fresh foods by the end of next week if the government did not take action.\nRichard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, on Tuesday urged the government to act, saying the gas shortages could affect the slaughter of up to 20m birds a week in the UK, the vast majority of which were chickens.\n\u201cIt will be a real challenge if there is a shortage of CO2 to the point that slaughterhouses cannot process the birds. That is really the worst-case scenario, which is why we are so hopeful that the government can step in here.\u201d\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Union called for urgent clarity over what had been agreed. Minette Batters, the union\u2019s president, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s good to hear there may be an agreement in principle that production at the fertiliser factories may restart, with resulting CO2 supplies, it\u2019s important this restart is meaningful and sustained.\n\u201cUsers of carbon dioxide were given little to no warning that supplies were going to be cut off \u2013 an indication of market failure in a sector supporting our critical national infrastructure. Urgent clarity is needed on the detail, including timings and volumes established in the agreement.\u201d\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the potential shortages of CO2 were \u201ca real crisis\u201d and said: \u201cThe just-in-time system which underpins both supermarkets and the hospitality industry is under the most strain it has ever been in the 40 years it has been there.\u201d\nAfter news of a potential deal to restart CO2 production emerged, affected businesses said there were still likely to be short-term problems with supplies.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have the detail, but if production can restart at appropriate scale before the end of the week, this should be enough to ensure pig and poultry production can continue at close to normal,\u201d Wright said.\nGavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: \u201cWe are encouraged by this latest development.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that supply of certain products won\u2019t be as abundant as usual over the next week or so, but this should only be a short-lived situation. However, we need more than a temporary fix \u2013 it can\u2019t be right that a company whose products are critical to the food and drink supply chain can be allowed to close without adequate warning or apparent consideration of the wider impacts. \u201d\nAndrew Opie, director of food at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets, said: \u201cWe welcome the announcement of a deal to get CO2 production back to normal levels. By taking decisive action on this important issue, the government will help prevent availability issues arising from CO2 shortages.\u201d",

The Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday it will provide 114 people as drivers and a further 111 personnel who will operate mobile testing units.\nThe defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: \u201cOur armed forces are once again stepping up, demonstrating their versatility as we support the Covid-19 response across the UK. We are proud to work alongside the dedicated men and women at the Scottish ambulance service.\u201d\nThe chief executive of the Welsh ambulance service NHS trust, Jason Killens, said: \u201cCovid-19 has presented a challenge like no other, but the last couple of months in particular have meant significant and sustained pressures on our ambulance service.\n\u201cThe trust is starting to return to some of the arrangements we had in place at the height of the pandemic to better manage the increase in Covid-19-related activity that we\u2019re feeling the impact of once again.\n\u201cAs part of this, we\u2019re seeking to re-enlist the military, who did a superb job of assisting us on two occasions previously last year.\n\u201cWinter is our busiest time, and this will enable us to get a head start on what we foresee will be a tough period, especially when you couple Covid-19 demand with seasonal flu and our usual winter pressures. More than 200 British army soldiers have already assisted the trust\u2019s Covid-19 effort by driving and decontaminating ambulance vehicles.\nA spokesperson for Joint Military Command Wales said: \u201cWe will work with the Welsh government and the Welsh ambulance services NHS trust to understand their requirements and offer assistance where appropriate.\u201d\nAndrew RT Davies, the leader of the Conservative group in the Senedd, said the ambulance service in Wales was in crisis and stretched \u201cridiculously thin.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is a shame this Labour-led Welsh government didn\u2019t get the ball rolling sooner.\u201d",

The pandemic is likely to see this increase, while some estimates suggest the withdrawal of the \u00a320 uplift to universal credit will push at least 500,000 below the breadline.\nThe committee noted the government has not had a UK-wide child poverty strategy since 2017, leaving England is the only one of the four UK countries without one. It urged ministers to commit to a cross-government strategy to reduce child poverty, setting clear and measurable objectives using the latest evidence.\n\u201cWe heard strong views that the absence of a strategy has left the government without a clear focus on tackling child poverty, with departments working in silos and a lack of clear leadership,\u201d the committee report said.\nIt also criticised the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 failure to produce up-to-date statistics on the impact of the pandemic on child poverty, saying this was \u201csurprising\u201d given its departmental responsibilities for poverty.\nLabour has pledged to establish a new child poverty reduction unit inside No 10, saying it will draw up plans to deliver a cross-government strategy reversing the rise in the numbers of children living in poverty since 2010.\nChild Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: \u201cThe committee is right to insist on a cross-departmental poverty-reduction plan with clear targets and championed from No 10. Without that focus and commitment, rising poverty will prove to be a ticking timebomb for children and for our wider prosperity.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe know that children in households where every adult is working are much less likely to be in poverty.

        "content": "The law will make planning a terrorist attack a crime, closing a loophole that meant authorities could not act against the Auckland supermarket attacker\nLegislation that will make planning a terrorist attack a crime in New Zealand is one step closer to becoming law, but the country\u2019s minor parties have voiced concerns the process is moving too fast and could lead to state surveillance overreach.\nThe government has fast-tracked the Counter-Terrorism Legislation bill, which aims to close the legal loophole around planning an attack, following the Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in Auckland earlier this month.\nThe country had tried for years to deport Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Sri Lankan man who was shot dead by police on 3 September after an attack at a supermarket in Auckland. Eight people were hurt in the attack, five of them with stab wounds.\nThe day after the attack, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, vowed to pass the law by the end of September. The bill passed its second reading in parliament on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to the house, the minister for justice, Kris Faafoi, said the impacts of the attacks on New Zealand had been immense and the government must do everything it could to try to prevent more from happening.\n\u201cIt provides our enforcement agencies with clear legal authority to disrupt terrorism-related activity, and hopefully before it occurs,\u201d Faafoi said.\n\u201cBut I do want to acknowledge that it is crucial the powers in this bill are not used disproportionately against any group of New Zealanders.\u201d\nThe National Party supported the bill. Its leader Judith Collins said: \u201cIf we need changes to terrorism legislation, it certainly is now.\u201d\nBut the Green party, ACT and Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori party) all opposed the bill.\nTe P\u0101ti M\u0101ori\u2019s co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer told RNZ the party has huge empathy for the victims of terrorism.\nBut she noted that such legislation has historically been used against M\u0101ori, such as the T\u016bhoe raids and Parihaka.\nThe T\u016bhoe raids in 2007, dubbed Operation 8, were the result of New Zealand\u2019s largest domestic anti-terror operation, involving 300 police officers.\nIt was the country\u2019s most controversial counter-terrorism operation, which saw police raid the Ng\u0101ti T\u016bhoe tribe after alleging they were running terrorist training camps. The T\u016bhoe said in their defence that the camp had been focused on bushcraft, hunting, and bootcamp-style training to get people off government benefits.\nIn court, the police case eventually crumbled: none of the 18 people arrested faced charges under the Terrorism Suppression Act, after the solicitor-general ruled that the evidence was insufficient.\nThe Green party\u2019s Teanau Tuiono said the party could not support the bill because more work must be done to protect human rights.\n\u201cPlanning or preparation offence has been characterised by some experts as thought crimes \u2013 difficult to define in practice or defend against in legal proceedings,\u201d Tuiono said.\n\u201cThe warrantless search and seizure powers that sit with this offence make the risks for human rights abuses even more significant.\u201d\nTuiono said the bill conferred broad powers to agencies that could lead to disproportionate surveillance and criminalisation.\nThe ACT party\u2019s Nicole McKee also opposed the bill, for fears that the finer points of murky law were being rushed.\n\u201cI hope that during the select committee process we actually manage to capture all of the concerns raised, but we are now restricted by a shortened time frame and the ability to garner feedback from those communities on our changes.\u201d\nThe bill was originally introduced in April as a direct response to New Zealand\u2019s worst mass shooting and terrorist attack: the March 2019 attack on two mosques in Christchurch, where a white supremacist gunman murdered 51 people.\nA royal commission in the aftermath of the attacks recommended a number of changes, including updates to terror legislation.\nThe new laws will criminalise planning or preparing for a terror act, even if there is no attempt to carry one out. They also criminalise weapons training or combat training for terrorist purposes, and give the police warrantless powers of entry, search and surveillance when suspecting someone of planning an attack.",

        "content": "Elimination still the strategy but PM is relying on luck and people doing the right thing in easing measures while there are still new cases, say experts\nNew Zealand is loosening its Covid restrictions, even as a handful of cases continue to circulate in the community, a move experts say represents a roll of the dice for a country that has steadfastly pursued an elimination strategy.\n\u201cIt is a gamble,\u201d says epidemiologist and public health professor Michael Baker. \u201cThe one phrase that I think you\u2019ll hear all the epidemiologists and modellers use is \u2018a calculated risk\u2019. But of course that implies you have a number you can apply to it \u2013 you could actually call it an uncalculated risk.\n\u201cIt increases the risk that we won\u2019t contain the outbreak, but it\u2019s hard to know what that increase is. That\u2019s where good luck comes into it.\u201d\nOn Monday, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that Auckland would move out of its strictest lockdown, into alert level 3. It marks a significant shift in restrictions for the city: cafes and restaurants can reopen for delivery and socially distanced sales, as well as a number of other businesses, and small weddings or funerals can proceed.\nThe change will see an estimated 300,000 additional people return to work in their city workplaces \u2013 in commercial kitchens, over coffee machines, at the greengrocer or on building sites \u2013 and much of that workforce has particular vulnerabilities to the virus. Those working in hospitality skew younger, so are much less likely to be fully vaccinated, and many frontline workers are M\u0101ori and Pasifika, who are likelier to live in large households and are more vulnerable to serious illness from Covid-19.\nWhile New Zealand has managed to significantly decrease cases from the outbreak\u2019s peak of 83 daily cases in August, it has not yet managed to stamp them out completely. For the past week, infections have rumbled along at a daily average of 17 new cases a day. The country continues to have unlinked, or \u201cmystery\u201d cases that have not yet been connected to an existing infection. And because daily case numbers only provide a snapshot of the past \u2013 always showing people who were infected days prior \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to be entirely sure whether Auckland\u2019s outbreak has been successfully contained.\n\u201cThe outbreak may have been entirely stamped out by now \u2013 we just don\u2019t know,\u201d Baker says. \u201cOr it could be simmering. These undetected chains of transmission could be simmering on.\u201d\nWhen Ardern announced the shift she said: \u201cWe are not stepping out of level 4 because the job is done, but nor are we moving because we don\u2019t think we can achieve the goal of stamping out Covid-19 \u2013 we are moving because level three still provides a cautious approach while we continue to stamp out Covid-19.\u201d\nBut loosening restrictions while those cases are still lurking may be the biggest risk the Ardern government has taken yet in its pandemic approach, and the stakes are high. Now, the best-case scenario for New Zealand is that elimination works under level 3: that even with more people mixing in workplaces, infections still tail off, taking the country back to zero. If that doesn\u2019t happen, and cases balloon in the coming weeks, Baker sees two options ahead: one is a return to level 4, which would be a huge political challenge for the Ardern government. The other is a pivot to suppression: using near-level 3 restrictions to keep the virus in check until vaccination levels are high enough \u2013 a point that he says the country is unlikely to reach before the end of the year.\n\u201cAt the moment I think we do have these fairly stark choices between fully stamping it out versus not quite getting there, and going into this suppression approach for potentially a few months,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe certainly do have to have an informed conversation in New Zealand at some stage about the conditions under which we would transition to suppression \u2013 assuming we get through this outbreak,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause there will be a point.\u201d\nThe director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, remains adamant that elimination is still Aotearoa\u2019s goal. But speaking to RNZ on Wednesday, Bloomfield said case numbers may not return to zero. \u201cWe may not get back to zero, but the important thing is we\u2019re going to keep finding any infections and basically continue to contact trace, test, isolate people so that we stop the virus circulating in the community, and that is the aim,\u201d he said.\nHe said health officials were aiming to get to a vaccination rate of over 90%. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely our new means whereby we will be able to get back to the freedoms we had under level 1,\u201d Bloomfield said.\nHaving 90% of the population immune is still likely months away. At this stage, 61% of the total population has had one shot, and 32% have had both. While the country has been vaccinating at a very high rate, rates peaked in August at about 90,000 a day and have been trending down to about half that. It\u2019s still not known how easy it will be to reach the 90% milestone or beyond: government data indicates that among those who are yet to get a vaccine, 20% are unsure about it or will not get it.\nAsked by radio host Mike Hosking what the next move would be if Auckland kept experiencing cases over the next two weeks, Bloomfield said: \u201cLet\u2019s cross that bridge when we get to it.\u201d\n\u201cAt alert level three, it\u2019s still possible to deal with the last remaining chains of transmission,\u201d Baker says. \u201cUnless you get unlucky.\u201d\nRelying on luck is a tough proposition when dealing with the Delta variant, which is far more infectious than the mutations New Zealand so effectively stamped out in the past. The country has been steadfastly committed to an elimination strategy, and any level of Covid in the community was intolerable. That strategy has served it well, preserving a strong economy, high employment, relative freedom and normalcy in-country, and very few deaths or serious illnesses from Covid-19.\nNew Zealand has been acutely aware of the worst-case scenario \u2013 an outbreak like the one in the Australian state of New South Wales, which started with a looser lockdown. It has produced thousands of cases and is now averaging 10 deaths a day.\nNow, with a shift to level 3, New Zealand\u2019s outcome hangs in the balance. \u201cThe next couple of weeks are crucial,\u201d says microbiologist and science communicator Dr Siouxsie Wiles, \u201cbecause it\u2019ll be a week or so before we really fully understand just that little bit more opening up at level 3, what it does.\u201d\nShe calls the loosening of restrictions \u201ca calculated risk\u201d \u2013 although not one she would have taken. \u201cIf it was my choice, I would be saying, level 4 for a little longer,\u201d Wiles says. \u201c[But] I\u2019ve always been more cautious than the government has been.\u201d\nBoth Wiles and Baker note that the government has access to finer-grained information \u2013 so may have a slightly different, more optimistic picture of how unlinked cases fit together, and how much spread to expect in the coming weeks. \u201cI really hope they\u2019re right, because obviously it\u2019s going to be pretty demoralizing to have to move back up the levels,\u201d Wiles says. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d\nThe challenge now will be both luck and compliance. After a month of lockdown, both the government and the experts are hoping New Zealanders will shrug off lockdown fatigue and make it through another fortnight of level 3 rules.\n\u201cI do believe that we can eliminate,\u201d Wiles says. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to lose hope. If all of us do the right thing, there\u2019s less chance of this getting out of control.\u201d",

Thirty or 40 pairs of eyes on open ground meant that they were disinclined to move, other than to shuffle forwards for a fresh bite. This was their home turf, just as it had been for hundreds of generations before.\nThere are numerous named warrens in the heathlands. Rabbit farming appeared to give the best return in the middle ages for landowners who tried and failed to grow crops in thin, acidic, sandy soil. A coney warren under royal licence was the poorer hunting gentry\u2019s deer park. By Henry VIII\u2019s reign, Clophill Warren, a dozen miles away, could be leased for \u00a33 a year. In late Victorian times, fecundity and abundance were registered in the records of this estate on the hill, where the \u201cbag\u201d from Arthur Wellesley Peel\u2019s shoots\u00a0numbered in the hundreds\u00a0every time.\nAnd, of course, rabbits spread out of every warren to more fertile land. A local farmer, telling me of his memories of rabbits immediately after the last war, described them as \u201ca\u00a0plague\u201d. Every day when I walked alongside\u00a0the pony paddocks and sheep fields to the foot of this RSPB reserve, I could count dozens squatting in each field. Today, I spotted just four rabbits. Such dearth has been typical of the\u00a0whole county.\nIn Sandy Warren meadow, the grass has grown taller than a rabbit\u2019s ears and there\u2019s not a bunny in sight. Most of the grazers probably fell prey to the highly contagious viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) \u2013 the RSPB\u2019s site manager tells me its bloody-nosed symptoms have been observed in the quarry over the road.\nAn older generation will remember that we have been here before \u2013 the arrival of myxomatosis in 1953 caused an estimated 99% fall in the UK\u2019s rabbit population. But that collapse came at a time when wildlife was in much better shape. Before VHD, two-thirds of a stoat\u2019s diet consisted of rabbits \u2013 where will such predators find alternative prey in today\u2019s woefully\u00a0depleted landscapes?\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

        "content": "Rest of G20 should follow Joe Biden\u2019s lead on funding commitments, says climate envoy\n\nDeveloping countries and campaigners welcomed the offer of increased climate finance from the US president, Joe Biden, at the UN on Tuesday, but warned that rich countries needed to do more to ensure the poorest received the assistance they need.\nBiden, speaking to the UN general assembly in New York, said he would ask the US Congress to double to $11bn (\u00a38m) a year by 2024 the financial assistance the US offers to developing countries to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather.\nClimate finance is one of the biggest issues at the forthcoming Cop26 UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, with developing countries at the conference anxious that a longstanding promise they would receive $100bn a year from 2020 has not yet been fulfilled.\nTina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and chair of the High Ambition Coalition at the UN climate talks, said: \u201cWatching Biden\u2019s speech today I thought \u2013 this is the announcement we\u2019ve been waiting for. Now we\u2019re looking to Congress to work with Biden to deliver, and to the rest of the G20 to follow suit on finance ambition.\u201d\nSimon Stiell, environment minister of Grenada, said: \u201cThe announcement from president Biden is the wind in the sails that we needed en route to Cop26. We know that this is bringing us one step closer to the delivery of the $100bn promised by donor countries \u2013 and that it will make a tangible difference in countries like mine that rely on this funding to adapt to the impacts of climate change we already feel today.\u201d\nBut the US efforts were not likely to be enough, said John Nordbo, of Care International. Given that the US is the world\u2019s biggest economy and second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, many hoped for more. \u201cThis updated pledge from Biden of an additional $5.7bn is definitely a positive step and it sends a strong signal. Considering where the US was this time last year [under Donald Trump], this is a leap forward in terms of climate leadership. However, the reality is that we are still a long way from closing the gap on climate finance commitments,\u201d he said.\nSome groups have called on the US to provide more than $40bn a year.\nHe added: \u201cThe climate finance gap is not just an American problem, it is a global problem. Almost all rich countries, apart from Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, need to commit more.\u201d\nClimate finance has been a key sticking point at the UN talks for more than a decade. In 2009, at the fractious Cop \u2013 the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, parent treaty to the 2015 Paris climate agreement \u2013 in Copenhagen, developed countries agreed that at least $100bn a year would flow in climate finance, from public and private sources, to the poor world by 2020.\nHowever, that totemic target has yet to be reached. On Friday, a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that climate finance in 2019, the latest year for which there is accurate data, had reached only about $80bn.\nAt Cop26, poor countries want not only the reassurance that the $100bn target will be fulfilled, but also that negotiations will begin on a new finance regime from 2025, which would ensure they have access to the funds they need to shift their economies on to a low-carbon footing and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.\nFor the poorest developing countries, there is a further complication. The bulk of the climate finance provided to date has gone to middle-income developing countries and has been poured into projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as renewable energy. But many of these projects are profitable and could have attracted finance in any case, from private sources.\nThe priority for the poorest developing countries is to receive adaptation finance, which helps them build resilience and adapt their infrastructure to the effects of extreme weather that are already in evidence around the world. But funding adaptation projects \u2013 such as sea walls, early warning systems, or better infrastructure \u2013 is expensive and usually does not produce a tangible financial return, so has been shunned by donors in favour of easy wins elsewhere.\nSome adaptation projects, such as restoring mangrove swamps or wetlands, can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect nature, so many countries have been pinning their hopes on gaining finance for \u201cnature-based solutions\u201d at Cop26, but this too has been slow to arrive.\nStege, of the High Ambition Coalition, which brings together developed and developing countries in support of the Paris agreement goals, said: \u201cHearing the US recognise the importance of adaptation is heartening, given the calls we\u2019ve heard from so many, including the UN secretary general, on the need for parity between [money for emissions reduction] and adaptation financing.\u201d\nThere are also concerns that some of the climate finance provided has come in the form of loans rather than grants, which can push poor countries deeper into debt, and some of it has come from existing development aid budgets, which means countries are losing out on funds for education, health and other public goods.\nNordbo said rich countries should come up with further pledges and clearer plans before Cop26. \u201cWe are inching forward on this issue, but the problem is that, meanwhile, thousands more people are being displaced or dying,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering how much money these [rich] countries have made from carbon emission-creating industries, not one of them is moving fast enough.\u201d",

The flipside, though, is it could leave both households, and to a lesser extent Australia\u2019s banks, vulnerable, if housing prices suddenly crashed.\nIn a speech, the RBA assistant governor responsible for financial stability, Michele Bullock, said housing credit was at an annualised rate of about 7%, with a peak of 11% probably around early next year.\n\u201cWith the increase in housing prices and housing debt, risks to financial stability could be building,\u201d Bullock said.\nLow interest rates were one of the reasons for market growth, with housing loans seen as serviceable, while Bullock also acknowledged government programs such as the Homebuilder scheme had helped support the construction industry.\nBut the growth in the housing market had led to Australia\u2019s banks growing their loan sheets, with homes accounting for about 60% of bank\u2019s lending.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Australia\u2019s banking system is at risk of a GFC-style collapse though, with their balance sheets overall still in a very strong position. But it does increase the risk Australia\u2019s banks are exposed to.\nMore exposed, though, are the borrowers themselves. Australia\u2019s household debt has increased over the last 30 years.\nThe increase in housing prices has pushed up the level of debt Australian homeholders enter into. An economic shock, such as a longer than anticipated recession, downturn in the job market, or drop in the housing market, could lead to a drop in consumption, meaning the economy as a whole would suffer.\n\u201cFor example, in a recession in which a large number of indebted households suffer reduced income, from say a loss of employment or reduced hours, they might choose to reduce their consumption,\u201d Bullock said.\n\u201cIt may be just precautionary. But if households are constrained, in the sense that they don\u2019t have a great deal of income left after meeting their debt servicing requirements and the basics of their lifestyle, they are more likely to reduce consumption. This will amplify the initial impact of the economic shock.\u201d\nWhich is why the RBA, which has no plans to raise interest rates until it sees inflation consistently reach 2% to 3% (which would mean a marked increase in wage growth) will be keeping a close eye on the housing market, in terms of what it could mean for the economy at large.\n\u201cEven though the banks have strong balance sheets and lending standards are being maintained, there is a risk that, in this environment, households will become increasingly indebted,\u201d Bullock said.\n\u201cA high level of debt could pose risks to the economy in the event of a shock to household incomes or a sharp decline in housing prices. It is these macro-financial risks that warrant close watching.\n\u201cWhether or not there is need to consider macro-prudential tools to address these risks is something we are continually assessing.\u201d",

Johnson once regarded a bilateral free trade agreement with the US as a key Brexit win. But government insiders concede that they see little prospect towards a deal, with the Biden administration focused on other priorities. Asked whether he still hoped to strike a free-trade agreement by the time of the next general election, Johnson said \u201cwe\u2019re going as fast as we can\u201d.

Analysis seen by the Guardian suggests a typical low-income UK family will be \u00a31,750 worse off by next April, as power bills and other factors combine into a cost of living crisis.

Seny Dieng thought that he had given QPR the edge, as did the majority inside a stadium that pulsed to the raucous beat of an enthralling Carabao Cup tie, including a pitch invader who made it as far as the centre circle, despite looking a little unsteady on his feet. Despite eve-of-game nerves surrounding a potential security threat, the third one-day international at Leicester between England and New Zealand took place without a single hiccup. Unless, that is, the home side\u2019s batting counts: for the second time in as many matches, England\u2019s top-order looked shot, as they stumbled to 78 for 7 after 23 overs.\nThe embattled Chinese property group Evergrande has allayed some fears of an imminent collapse by saying it can repay a local debt payment of $35m tomorrow. Although markets picked up on the news, Evergrande did not say whether it would also be able to meet a $83m interest payment on a US dollar debt also due tomorrow. The FTSE100 is set to lift 0.2% on the news, while the pound is on $1.365 and \u20ac1.165. Ladbrokes is the latest UK business to be targeted for takeover by a US rival, with Draft Kings offering \u00a313bn for the company.\nThe Guardian leads with \u201cNo deal: PM\u2019s hopes of securing trade pact with Biden in disarray\u201d, and Boris Johnson\u2019s trip to the US is also the lead in several other papers.

        "content": "The village of Ripley, with its castle and walled gardens, proves the perfect setting for learning to make personalised gin\n\u2018It\u2019s about to happen, I promise!\u201d says Rob Crossley, the \u201cProfessor\u201d, as he uses asbestos fingers to gingerly tip-tap his way along a copper pipe to where the magic is to begin. When the heat spreads all the way down to the spindly tip, he knows the temperature will be right for the drip to start.\nThis hand-hammered copper pot, with its bulging belly warmed by a small electric hob, looks a lot like something from a Harry Potter potion-making class. Which is fitting, because I\u2019m inside the walls of a castle \u2013 it\u2019s just that I\u2019m making gin rather than polyjuice. Having been a member of the gin fanclub way longer than it\u2019s been fashionable, it feels overdue that I\u2019m learning to make my own (along with 11 other eager students). \n After the relaxation of licensing laws that spawned a boom in craft distilleries, gin schools have popped up across the UK in the past five years. This one, run by Harrogate Tipple, is in a particularly impressive location, though. A long, vaulted window to my right neatly frames a square, crenulated turret of Ripley Castle\u2019s east wing, with a circular gravel drive in the foreground and fields in the distance. And to get to the charcoal-walled gin-making room, I entered through a fake wall in the gin shop, the door handle disguised as an unassuming porcelain bottle on a bookshelf.\nThe gin school is Ripley Castle\u2019s latest move to diversify the estate\u2019s revenue streams. The castle is already home to quad-biking, archery, body-zorbing, outdoor treasure hunts and indoor escape rooms.\n\u201cThese places are incredibly expensive to run,\u201d says Lady Emma Ingilby, whose business-and-marketing nous has helped keep the estate afloat over the past three decades. \u201cOur business strategy has focused on the village, to make it a destination.\u201d\nOn the weekend of my visit, it\u2019s clear how successful the Ingilbys have been. The village is full of concert-goers who\u2019ve come for a gig overlooking the castle\u2019s lake and deer park, and there\u2019s music in the air.\nOn the edge of the Dales and less than four miles from Harrogate, Ripley is as chocolate box as they come. Sandstone-coloured Georgian townhouses framing a cobbled square where locals, tourists, hikers and bikers commune over pints from the ivy-clad Boar\u2019s Head inn, where I\u2019m staying. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s all so uniformly pretty. On a whim, in the 1800s, the Lord Ingilby of the day decided to remodel Ripley on a French village. The Ingilbys have resided at Ripley for more than 700 years and until 1974 when the current Lord Ingilby inherited, 80% of the village still belonged to the estate.\nOur gin-making evening began earlier at Harrogate Tipple\u2019s distillery in the village with an introduction to the stills, Zac and Cassie, named after two of the owner\u2019s children, and a brief rundown of the history of gin and the history of the distillery. The gin school has been years in the making. The distillery\u2019s founder, Steven Green, is a cameraman who has travelled the world shooting film. His heart, however, was always in North Yorkshire and Harrogate Tipple \u2013 launched in 2018 \u2013 was conceived as a way to keep it here. Steve poured his Hollywood patter into the distillery and it was soon producing Downton Abbey\u2019s official gin (yep the TV drama has its own tipple). \u201cIf you put a pin on the map of England where Downton is set, it\u2019s exactly where we are,\u201d he told me at the time.\nThe gins have now won several accolades but Steve\u2019s masterplan always included a gin school. Its intended home was a Victorian hothouse in Ripley Castle\u2019s walled gardens. Then something happened. \u201cWe put in new plumbing, new electrics, we replaced 36 panes of glass, and then the roof started falling in,\u201d says Green. After that the pandemic hit and the distillery spent months churning out hand sanitiser. It\u2019s only recently that the school has finally got off the ground.\nOne thing that sets Harrogate Tipple\u2019s school apart is the fact that participants get to venture into the castle\u2019s walled gardens to pick fresh botanicals. Lady Emma has leased the distillery a 30sq m plot, along with a hothouse for winter, and it now has about 140 plants and flowers at its fingertips, along with honey from Lady Emma\u2019s beehives.\n Over a gooseberry G&T, I scour my booklet of fresh botanicals, each listed with a flavour profile and recommended quantity. Do I want lovage (\u201ccitrus celery, with a hint of anise\u201d) in my gin? Or how about Lady Plymouth (\u201crose and mint dancing together\u201d)? And would wormwood (\u201cthe bitterest of herbs\u201d) throw everything off balance? \u201cThere is no right or wrong answer,\u201d says Rob as we head off into the castle gardens with cotton bags, scissors and hand-illustrated garden maps.\n \u201cGet stuck in. Smell stuff, rub stuff,\u201d he instructs. Each plant is a revelation. I discover feather-edged, herby pelargoniums, which taste different depending on the variety. There\u2019s glossy lime leaves with an unmistakable pepperiness, and fluffy bronze fennel that smacks of aniseed, but laced with notes of intense sweetness that I hadn\u2019t expected.\nBack inside we weigh dry ingredients like lemon verbena and oats, grind coriander seeds and nuts such as hazel and almond and choose from the leaves we\u2019ve picked. It all goes into our own 1L copper stills, along with a prepared base of juniper and classic botanicals like cassia bark and angelica root (so that proceedings don\u2019t go too awry), and a base alcohol akin to vodka. The stills are heated and we wait, giddy with anticipation.\nRemarkably, the process from heating the liquor to bottling the end product, diluted with Harrogate spring water to bring it down to about 40% ABV, only takes about an hour.\nThe gin I end up with, dripped out over more G&Ts with boisterous music and chatter, is a personalised expression of the Yorkshire gardens I\u2019ve been exploring. But it\u2019s also a reflection of my palette and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to find I love it. It\u2019s heavy on the coriander, extremely herbacious and savoury \u2013 perhaps not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it\u2019s exactly what I want to drink. Could this revolutionise my drinking habits? The ingredients and quantities are recorded and logged by the distillery in case I want to reorder. I already feel as if I might.\nThe trip was provided by Harrogate Tipple; its three-hour gin-making experience costs \u00a3125pp, including a 50cl personalised bottle of gin.

        "content": "Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino and former campaign manager Brad Parscale are among those being targeted\nThe House select committee investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol is considering issuing a blitz of subpoenas for top Trump White House aides including the former chief and deputy chief of staff, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThe subpoenas \u2013 which are expected to be authorized as early as this week \u2013 would place House select committee investigators inside the White House and Trump campaign war rooms at the time of the insurrection as the panel prepares to ramp up the pace of its inquiry.\nHouse select committee investigators are considering subpoenas for call detail records or testimony of key aides including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, the source said.\nThe scope and subjects of the subpoenas are not yet finalized and discussions about who to include in the first tranche are still ongoing, the source said, although the three Trump officials are presently considered likely targets.\nTaken together, the developing move from the select committee marks perhaps the most aggressive investigative actions since the panel made an array of records demands and records preservation requests for Trump officials last month.\nIt is also likely to further inflame tensions with Trump, already furious at the select committee for opening a line of inquiry into what he knew in advance of plans to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win, as well as Republicans under scrutiny over 6 January.\nTrump officials such as Meadows, Scavino and Parscale played a major part in advancing baseless and disproven lies about a stolen 2020 election that precipitated the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally which descended into the insurrection as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\nThe former White House chief of staff, who remained by Trump\u2019s side as the violence unfolded, is among several aides who may hold the key to unlock inside information pertaining to the Capitol attack that left five dead and nearly 140 injured.\nBut House select committee investigators are also taking a special interest in the role played by Scavino, the source said, since he held the additional role of being the director of social media \u2013 Trump\u2019s preferred messaging platform.\nSubpoenas for call detail records, testimony or other material from those Trump officials and other individuals involved in the 6 January attack would cast a close net around the former president\u2019s inner circle while simultaneously putting them at the center of the investigation.\nHouse select committee investigators first signaled their intention to pursue a close inquiry into the potential role played by the Trump White House and House Republicans when they asked 35 telecom and social media companies to preserve records in case of later subpoenas.\nIn the records preservation requests, the select committee instructed the companies to avoid destroying the records of several hundred people, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and, as the Guardian reported, the White House chief of staff Meadows.\nMuch of the investigative work by the select committee has so far been focused on gathering evidence, as a prosecutor might, to build a case backstopped by empirical data that would safeguard its final report from criticism of partisanship or built-in bias.\nTo that end, the select committee is also in the process of scheduling closed-door depositions with key persons of interest included in and beyond the subpoenas, the source said, though the agenda and potential subjects of the interviews were not immediately clear.\nA spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment about subpoena discussions for Trump administration and campaign officials. But the panel\u2019s chairman, Bennie Thompson, previously told the Guardian he would investigate 6 January conversations involving Trump.\nHouse select committee investigators are showing a new urgency to jolt the investigation into higher gear after the panel held its first hearing before members departed Washington for an extended summer recess. The full select committee \u2013 members, counsel and advisors \u2013 met for the first time on Monday for more than five hours in the Capitol, taking only short breaks to vote, grab dinner and make an occasional dash to the toilet.\nMembers and staff for the select committee say they remain in discussions about when and on what topic to schedule a second hearing. At least two members told the Guardian they now expect the next public hearing will be delayed until October, though plans remain fluid.\nCongressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee, told reporters after the meeting that new facts about the Capitol attack were surfacing every day and that he expected the panel to ultimately receive all the records and testimony it sought.\nRaskin added that he was pushing to secure testimony under oath from anyone with relevant information. \u201cWe should see it as an honor and a privilege to be able to provide evidence to Congress about this violent insurrection,\u201d he said.\nHouse select committee investigators are expected to present the subpoenas as non-negotiable, and 6 January select committee member Adam Schiff told reporters that subpoenas were imminent for individuals expected to resist requests for testimony.\n\u201cIn some cases, we\u2019re making requests we think will be complied with,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cIn other cases, we\u2019re going straight to subpoenas where we think we\u2019re dealing with recalcitrant witnesses.\u201d\nSchiff, a former Trump impeachment manager from the 2019 trial and the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said he hoped the justice department would also help the select committee hold subpoena defiers in contempt of Congress.\nTrump has threatened in recent weeks to mount challenges to the select committee\u2019s work, enraged at the prospect of his embarrassing private efforts to subvert the 2020 election results and reinstall himself in office being made public.\n\u201cExecutive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of my administration and the patriots who worked beside me, but on behalf of the office of the president of the United States and the future of our nation,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\n  It was not clear whether his claims of executive privilege carried weight. The justice department has declined to assert the protection over Capitol attack testimony after the White House office of legal counsel determined it did not exist to benefit private interests.",

        "content": "Theatre Royal PlymouthBouncy songs explore three patients\u2019 experiences in this ambitious and spirited show about the health service\u2019s history and current crisis\nAs audiences return to theatres, will they want razzle-dazzle escapism or plays that grapple with the seismic events of the past 18 months? Few shows could claim to do both, but NHS the Musical delivers a bright, brassy night out while examining an institution beset by burnout and excessive workloads even before the pandemic.\nWritten by Nick Stimson and composed by Jimmy Jewell, it is put across with such energy that the cast seem to sustain the spirit of lockdown\u2019s clap for carers across two hours of songs and skits. An opening montage of news footage starting in Wuhan serves as a reminder of how we came to be sitting, masked, in a theatre kitted out with sanitiser dispensers and approaching what may be one of the NHS\u2019s worst winters in its history.\nMichael Taylor\u2019s set has the familiar glare and anonymity of a hospital ward. A wavy back wall evoking a cubicle curtain serves as a video screen and also intermittently reveals a swinging band. The actors mostly play archetypes \u2013 porter, doctor, politician \u2013 and we experience the NHS through the eyes of three patients. Jimmy Johnston portrays a wise-cracking pub landlord with a \u201cdicky ticker\u201d; Alice Frankham is a yoga devotee expecting a baby; Neil Stewart is waiting for a new hip and finds himself at the bottom of a long list.\nThis trio\u2019s journey through a system that is as labyrinthine as the hospital itself is interwoven with startling statistics, bouncy songs comprising medical conditions and some familiar history. There\u2019s the founding story of the service, with Johnston as Aneurin Bevan, whose \u201cfree at the point of delivery\u201d line is neatly accompanied by a patient giving birth. Labour\u2019s 1997 reforms are assessed and a multi-roling cast bring us cleaners, surgeons, an NHS manager (Justina Kehinde) obsessed with targets and ratings, and a pharmaceutical supplier whose jacket is lined with pillboxes.\nThe swift pace resembles a doctor doing the rounds and a whirl of headline issues are addressed, albeit at surface level. Boris Johnson\u2019s \u00a3350m Brexit bus pledge goes unexplored; Peter Caulfield (a delight as the silky smooth doctor) dons a scarecrow wig to lampoon the PM in a toothless sketch while a simple cutaway to Matt Hancock\u2019s face as a later punchline is far funnier. There is a clear sense of the service as a political football, as Sabrina Aloueche sports four different party rosettes to spout contrasting rhetoric.\nThe humour is often authentically blunt and deadpan, with the characters displaying surprisingly little of what nurse turned author Christie Watson termed \u201cthe language of kindness\u201d in her memoir of that title. Earlier this year, a touring adaptation of that book captured more acutely both the inner turmoil of hospital staff and the warmth in their care.\nWhat you do get here is a strong sense of the bond forged between patients amid their shared fear. The danger, throughout the show, is of such jolly songs and quips ever glossing over a single death from the pandemic. Two moving sections, one recognising how music can play an empty tune amid grief, are skilfully incorporated into the second half. Jordan Castle\u2019s affable, rich-voiced porter plays a key role in keeping the show grounded.\nThe mechanics of a musical, a little like those of a health service, are complex and require different departments to work in sync. The elements here don\u2019t always come together and a greater variety of tone \u2013 both musically and comedically \u2013 would be welcome. But the show\u2019s ambition, vigour and heart-on-sleeve spirit are undeniable and it deftly demonstrates how a simple postwar vision resulted in a sprawling, often perplexing system that never sleeps and, ultimately, awaits us all.\nAt Theatre Royal Plymouth until 25 September.",

With the cost of living rising as fast as it is, we\u2019re still at the same pay rate.\u201d\nNunez and Greathouse are far from alone. Workers in the public sector around the United States have faced drastic cuts and layoffs, leaving workers even more understaffed, underpaid and overworked through the Covid-19 pandemic than they were before. About 815,000 jobs have been lost in the American public sector since the start of the pandemic and job recovery in the public sector has lagged behind the private sector.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a crisis in the public sector in this country in all public services,\u201d said Margaret Cook, vice-president of CWA-PHEW (Communications Workers of America Public, Healthcare and Education Workers).\nLocal and state governments have made significant cuts in anticipation of budget shortfalls caused by Covid-19, but even as federal assistance has helped offset shortfalls, workers are still bearing the brunt of the pandemic\u2019s impact in the form of increased workloads, lack of benefits, low pay and a lack of general investment in public services in favor of austerity and privatization.\nFor many, working in the public sector feels almost untenable.\nNunez, who has worked for 16 years at the public university in New Mexico, is charged for parking and pays for health insurance coverage, leaving her with little left to take care of herself and her family. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to make ends meet or support our families,\u201d said Nunez. \u201cMost people here have to work two jobs, because we can\u2019t get by on working for the university alone.\u201d\nCook said that local unions and workers are fighting for a $15 an hour minimum wage and to pressure local and state governments to use federal aid to support and compensate workers in the public sector who have continued to keep public services running through the pandemic.\n\u201cNow is the time to make sure they\u2019re compensated for the type of care and responsibility they hold,\u201d said Cook. \u201cNo worker should make below $15 an hour. That is just the minimum threshold that we believe a worker should be able to work a full-time job and not rely on food stamps from the state if they work for the state.\u201d\nLouise Irizarry, 59, worked for eight years at Kennesaw State University, a public university in Georgia, as an administrative specialist in the student affairs department. She was one of several workers at the university who were laid off in late 2020 in anticipation of budget shortfalls, despite record student enrollment at the school and a decision to provide bonuses to all university workers shortly after the cuts, citing unanticipated funds.\nSome of the lowest-paid workers in public higher education systems, who are disproportionately women and Black workers, have faced the most consistent and drastic layoffs and cuts through the pandemic.\nWhen she was laid off, Irizarry was less than two years away from her pension vesting at the 10-year mark. Even though there have been hundreds of job openings at the university since the layoff, she has struggled to find a comparable position, though laidoff employees are supposed to receive priority in new hirings.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my pension,\u201d said Irizarry, who has only been able to find two part-time jobs with no benefits to replace the full-time job she lost. She is still trying to regain employment at the university, while her subsidized Cobra health insurance is due to expire soon.\n\u201cI have a chronic illness and to trying to get healthcare has been just impossible,\u201d added Irizarry. \u201cThe university had opportunities where they had a chance to be able to fix this and make right by it and they haven\u2019t.\u201d\nOther workers in the public sector who have kept their jobs through the pandemic have faced greater workloads, while struggling to care for sick family members and take care of children who have been in and out of remote learning as schools and daycare centers have either been shut down or have periodically closed for quarantines.\nKristen McManis works as an operator at a 24/7 distribution center for a utilities company owned by the city of Gainesville, Florida.\nThrough the pandemic she has worked hundreds of hours of overtime, while she and her coworkers have struggled to care for family and children. Family and medical leave was initially offered to employees, but then expired after workers were discouraged from using it. She had to donate her own personal leave time to coworkers who couldn\u2019t access childcare or had to take care of sick family members.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been donating a lot of my leads to my co-workers who have been sick, and they\u2019ve exhausted all of their leaves.

        "content": "The magnitude 5.9 quake was the largest in Victoria\u2019s recorded history and likely occurred along the deep faultline that separates Melbourne from the alpine region\nAn earthquake affected south-east Australia on Tuesday with seismologists placing its magnitude at 5.9, making it the largest onshore earthquake in Victoria\u2019s recorded history. The epicentre was Mansfield, in the foothills of the Victorian Alps, but it was felt as far away as New South Wales and Tasmania. Despite this, only mild structural damaged occurred, and there were no reports of injuries. So what prompted the earthquake and why was its impact relatively mild?\nDr Adrian McCallum, a senior lecturer in geotechnical engineering at the University of the Sunshine Coast, says the continental plate on which Australia sits is moving north at about 7cm a year, building up compressive stress within the plate. This stress is occasionally released, resulting in an earthquake, typically along pre-existing faultlines.\nGeological maps of Victoria show a large number of faults in Mansfield, McCallum says.\nDr Ben Mather, a plate tectonics expert at the University of Sydney, says the earthquake in Mansfield \u201clikely occurred along the Governor Fault \u2013 one of the deepest faults in Victoria \u2013 that separates the Melbourne zone from the alpine region\u201d.\nAssociate Prof Iftekhar Ahmed, from the school of architecture and built environment at the University of Newcastle, says the alpine region used to be an area of volcanic eruptions hundreds of years ago. \u201cSo it\u2019s an area of seismic activity,\u201d he says. \u201cThis faultline runs on a north-south parallel, and if it\u2019s where this earthquake originated from, then that\u2019s why the wave was felt all along the eastern seaboard, all the way to Tassie\u201d.\nAhmed says: \u201cEarthquakes don\u2019t kill people, buildings do.\u201d\n\u201cOur buildings are built to a certain level of seismic resistance,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the older buildings aren\u2019t, but many have been retrofitted to bring them up to standard.\u201d\nDr Januka Attanayake, the research lead with the University of Melbourne\u2019s Earthquake Seismology Earth Sciences unit, says in the aftermath of earthquakes like the one on Tuesday, seismologists would usually install more seismometers to try to detect aftershocks, which can last for months but are usually much milder than the initial earthquake and not felt by people.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cIt\u2019s important work because if we can detect aftershocks we can detect the fault area that ruptured,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to know this information for proper future hazard analysis. It helps us detect expected ground motions of earthquakes going forward. This is essential information for engineers building city structures in future, as we can, for example, say how much ground motion can be expected at a given location over the next 50 years.\u201d\nTwo aftershocks of 2.5 and 3.0 magnitude have already been detected.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nAhmed says while it is not possible to precisely predict earthquakes, mapping of seismic activity and recorded earthquakes indicate an area\u2019s risk, which is the basis for risk reduction measures, including the construction of buildings to a seismic standard.\nNot of this magnitude in Victoria.\nAttanayake says \u201cit is probably the largest earthquake we have felt around Melbourne in the last 175 to 200 years\u201d. \u201cThis is the first earthquake of this magnitude I have seen here during my lifetime, and it has probably not been seen during the lifetime of several generations,\u201d he says.\nBut Victoria does record about 400 earthquakes of less than magnitude 2.5 every year, he says. \u201cSo earthquakes are not an exception.\u201d\nProf Adrian Russell, a geotechnical engineer at the University of New South Wales Centre for Infrastructure Engineering and Safety, says earthquakes are an important consideration for Australia.\n\u201cEarthquakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater occur about once every six months and are sufficient to cause widespread damage if near our oldest cities and infrastructure,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, reinsurance companies rate an earthquake in Sydney in their 20 top risk exposures worldwide, not because the earthquake would be large, but because there would be widespread and yet fairly mild property damage.\u201d\nAside from properly designing buildings, there are steps people can take to avoid injury during an earthquake.\nAccording to the SES, if you are inside: \u201cDrop to the ground; take cover by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and hold until the shaking stops.\n\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building,\u201d the advice says. \u201cStay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.\u201d",

        "content": "Christian Democrat continuity candidate Armin Laschet is struggling to live up to his brief\nAngela Merkel\u2019s shoe size is 38, she revealed to a rain-sodden, momentarily confused audience at an election rally on the Baltic coast on Tuesday night. That is relatively small \u2013 5.5 in UK sizes \u2013 which means her shoes should not be too hard to fill. \u201cThat\u2019s manageable,\u201d Merkel said.\nAs the German chancellor chuckled mischievously, she gestured towards the man on her left, a 33-year-old tax auditor who is running to inherit the north-eastern constituency she has held since it was created in 1990. But her comment also applied to the man on her right, Armin Laschet, who is meant to lead the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) into the post-Merkel era as her designated continuity candidate at Sunday\u2019s national election.\nLaschet, 60, is struggling to live up to his brief, with the CDU scrambling in polls behind the resurgent Social Democratic party (SPD) of the finance minister, Olaf Scholz. For the behemoth of postwar German politics to slump to second place after 16 years in power, possibly on no more than about 20% of the vote, would amount to nothing less than a political earthquake.\nTuesday\u2019s rally in Stralsund was meant to be one of the last opportunities to turn the tide for Laschet\u2019s campaign and send Merkel\u2019s many admirers across the country into the voting booths full of enthusiasm for her chosen successor.\nThe mood music on the night was anything but promising. An ash grey sky brought gusts of wind and rain to Stralsund\u2019s Alter Markt town square just as Merkel and entourage took to the stage. A small but noisy crowd of fewer than 50 anti-lockdown protesters chanting \u201cMerkel muss weg\u201d (\u201cMerkel must go\u201d) threatened to drown out the politicians\u2019 speeches.\nBut the chancellor gave it her best. Laschet, she said, would fight to bring jobs into the structurally weak region in the formerly socialist east with the same dedication she had shown, while a leftwing coalition led by Scholz would \u201conly think about how to distribute wealth, not generate it\u201d.\nMerkel warned that a left-leaning German government would run up joint debts with the rest of Europe not just temporarily, through the EU\u2019s pandemic recovery package, but permanently, \u201cwhich would not be good for Europe and become a great burden in a few years\u2019 time\u201d.\nStill, fiery rhetoric has never been Merkel\u2019s forte, and the line about her shoe size was the most memorable. In a typical Merkellian twist, she opted to express her support not by talking up the feats of a future chancellor Laschet, but by talking down her own.\nThe line of succession to Merkel\u2019s tenure has been the source of speculation since her second term in office, when names whispered in Berlin\u2019s corridors of power were the since-disgraced Bavarian defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, and Ursula von der Leyen, now the president of the European Commission.\nSince then, that line has been redrawn, rubbed out and sketched anew so many times that its final destination looks less like a work of draftsmanship than the result of a slip of the pen.\nLaschet has many qualities: the Rhinelander can be a great speaker, as he displayed in the speech that won him the CDU leadership in January this year; he is respectful towards those from other political tribes; like Merkel, he is easily underestimated and has sticking power. If he can make up a few percentage points before Sunday, he may still come to lead the next governing coalition.\nYet when he stands next to the chancellor, there is an overwhelming sense that Merkel\u2019s small shoes may be too big for him.\nTwo weeks before the vote, the news weekly Der Spiegel ran a cover story entitled Das Laschet Disaster, in which it accused the CDU candidate of several strategic errors: a bitty political agenda, a lack of a coherent narrative about what he wants to do with the top job in German politics, and above all, a lack of focus.\n\u201cLaschet acts as if he was waiting to inherit Merkel\u2019s power \u2013 and not to win support and votes,\u201d Spiegel wrote.\nThe same lapses in concentration were apparent by the Baltic Sea on Tuesday night. Laschet praised Merkel\u2019s record of bringing unemployment in the city down from 24.1% to under 8%, and vowed to \u201ccontinue her work\u201d.\nBut when he commiserated over the death of a 20-year-old petrol station worker at the hands of what appears to have been a militant anti-masker, he muddled up the date of the incident and his condemnation lacked gravitas. \u201cYou can argue about everything, you can have different opinions about corona[virus], but one must not hurt others,\u201d Laschet said.\nA small band of hardcore CDU supporters tried to respond to the ensuing jeers from the anti-vaxxers with a chant of Armin Laschet wird Kanzler (\u201cArmin Laschet will be chancellor\u201d) to the tune of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army, but gave up soon after.\nShould the CDU not emerge as the strongest force in the country on Sunday night, an almighty in-party reckoning beckons. The former finance minister and CDU veteran Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble gave a flavour of the resentments simmering beneath the surface last weekend when he already pinned the blame for Laschet\u2019s struggles on the outgoing chancellor.\nFaced with a growing mutiny insider her own party\u2019s ranks, Merkel had handed over the leadership of the CDU to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in 2018 but held on to the chancellory. A mistake, Sch\u00e4uble told Tagesspiegel newspaper, that had left the party able to claim neither that \u201ceverything will change\u201d nor that \u201ceverything will stay the same\u201d.\nOthers, in turn, blame Sch\u00e4uble and other grandees such as the state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, who backed Laschet to become the carthorse of the CDU campaign over Markus S\u00f6der, the waspish Bavarian premier who looked fresher, more combative and popular than the Rhinelander when the party bloc made up its mind over the candidacy in the spring.\nOn Monday S\u00f6der was quick to defend Merkel, pointing to her impressive approval ratings. Laschet\u2019s poor campaign, he said by implication, was of Laschet\u2019s own making. Should the CDU come in second or level with the SPD, he is likely to soon put across that point in more unequivocal terms.",

        "content": "Severe wildfires are making the recovery process for plants and animals more challenging, sometimes for years after the flames\nAfter more than two months, the battle to contain the Dixie fire \u2013 a behemoth blaze that swept nearly 1m acres, leveling mountain towns and blackening the conifer-covered landscape \u2013 is nearing its end.\nBut even after the fire crews pack up, threats remain for the plants and animals that call this area home. Scientists are warning that the severity of today\u2019s wildfires is making the recovery process increasingly challenging, sometimes for years after the flames are put out.\nThe American west has evolved alongside fire, which is a natural part of the landscape. But fueled by warmer, drier conditions and an overabundance of parched vegetation, blazes are increasingly burning more ferociously, consuming nearly everything in their path.\nThe size but also the severity of today\u2019s wildfires is a growing concern. Fires that exhibit erratic behavior and burn with more intensity are more likely to leave behind only patches of living landscape.\n\u201cThere is the extent of the fire and there is the intensity of the fire. When you get these big intense fires, you mostly kill those animals,\u201d said ecologist Brad Shaffer, the director of the UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science. \u201cIf you don\u2019t kill them then when they come back and it\u2019s just a big ash field, there are no plants and therefore no insects. They starve to death.\u201d\nIn these high-severity burns, vegetation on the forest floor is consumed by the flames, and shrubs and stumps are reduced to ash. The soil itself changes, and even beneath the ground, tree roots are burned. These moonscapes can take between five and 10 years to regenerate \u2013 far too long for some species to wait.\nScientists are also finding that some landscapes remain permanently changed and trees struggle to grow where they once flourished. Surviving animals, faced with reduced populations after a fire, may resort to inbreeding, ultimately reducing their resilience while the climate becomes less hospitable.\n\u201cWhat you are creating is analogous to an ocean that has a few little islands on it,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cIt is very hard to move across that super burnt landscape in a short amount of time.\u201d For small animals, like the lizards and amphibians he specializes in, \u201cyou have to wait for it to come back\u201d.\nShaffer, who is studying how ecosystems recovered in the Woolsey fire, which burned in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in 2018, says research on the issue is still unfolding. But without mitigation, some animals may not be able to adapt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very nasty feedback loop,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cThe result is small, isolated, genetically inbred populations that are often extremely compromised, with less resilience to catastrophic challenges associated with climate change and with little chance of recovery.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still unclear what\u2019s been left in the footprint of the Dixiefire. The Burned Area Emergency Response (Baer), specialized crews with the US Forest Service staffed by engineers, biologists, archeologists and other highly trained experts, are deploying into the cooled parts of the Dixie scar to assess the damage.\nWhile the official prognosis is yet to come, Brian Rhodes, the deputy director of fire and aviation management with the US Forest Service, says he is optimistic some areas may have been spared the worst. \n \u201cThere are definitely pockets of high severity but not as broad as one would expect,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally speaking I would anticipate it being a mixture of high severity, moderate severity and maybe in some places low severity.\u201d\nStill, researchers have found that fire severity overall is trending in a more dangerous direction.\n\u201cWe are seeing an increase in the proportion of area burned at high severity with climate change,\u201d said Camille Stevens-Rumann, an assistant professor at Colorado State University who studies fire ecology and recovery. The hot, windy days when high-severity burning is likely have defined the 2021 fire season, and helped fires like the Dixie evade containment efforts for weeks on end.\nThose conditions also make it more difficult for forests to heal the ways they once did. Healthy fires tend to burn low to the ground, creeping through the bases of trees and clearing the undergrowth. Severe fires shoot flames hundreds of feet high, scorching the canopies and overcoming natural defenses evolved across centuries. When older trees succumb, seedlings struggle.\n\u201cRather than having some standing trees helping shade the ground and keep it cooler and more moist, it\u2019s just this large expanse of black charred earth which can make it difficult for trees to establish,\u201d Stevens-Rumann said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about whether these forests are going to have a longer-term conversion, moving away from a forested ecosystem to something else,\u201d she added, explaining that, on this trajectory, once-forested landscapes could soon shift to become shrub-covered chaparral, which is more flammable. Chaparral landscapes, in turn, could convert to grasslands.\nThis could also mean big changes for the animals that live there. \u201cIf we had the spotted owl or another endangered species that is used to a dense dark forest, they are not going to use the shrubland ecosystem in the same way, or perhaps at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are changing the habitat for a lot of different species.\u201d\nClimate change is the main culprit in increasing the intensity of fires but it has not acted alone. A long history of suppressing natural fire \u2013 the kind needed to keep forests healthy \u2013 has only made the problem worse.\nOfficials are embracing and implementing badly needed mitigation tools, including forest thinning and prescribed burning, but scientists have said that more urgency and action is needed to slow the changes already under way.\n\u201cThe more preemptive action we can really do to stop that next large, high-severity fire is the best way we are going to maintain forests across our landscape,\u201d Stevens-Rumann said. \u201cA lot of times that\u2019s fighting fire with fire.\u201d",

Members of the public used the land frequently, the court heard.\nA trail from a nearby reserve allowed dog walkers, mountain bike riders and likely motorcyclists to cross the block in both directions.

Despite calls to ensure a fair global vaccine supply, some companies have continued to disproportionally distribute vaccines to wealthy countries, according to Amnesty\u2019s report, published today.\nAgn\u00e8s Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, said: \u201cBig pharma\u2019s intentional blocking of knowledge transfer and their wheeling and dealing in favour of wealthy states has brewed an utterly devastating vaccine scarcity for so many others.\u201d\nCallamard said: \u201c[These companies\u2019] actions are plunging parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia into renewed crises, pushing weakened health systems to the very brink and causing tens of thousands of preventable deaths every week.\u201d\nAmong its findings, the report states that Pfizer and BioNTech have so far delivered nine times more vaccines to Sweden than to all low-income countries combined. Both companies revenues have increased substantially in 2021 compared with 2020 due to sales of the Covid-19 vaccine, which is sold at a high price, the report said.\nIn a letter to Amnesty, Dr Albert Bourla, chief executive of Pfizer, wrote: \u201cWe established pricing principles for the Covid-19 vaccine which are consistent with Pfizer\u2019s commitment to the right to health.\u201d\nBioNTech told Amnesty that it was working to provide 2bn doses to low- and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022.\nModerna has not yet delivered a single vaccine dose to a low-income country and will not deliver the vast majority of its promised supplies to Covax \u2013 a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines \u2013 until next year.\nModerna told Amnesty that it would be supplying up to 500m doses of its vaccine to Covax, including an initial 34m doses at the end of this year.\nHigher prices mean the company received revenues of $4.4bn for the second quarter of 2021, up from $67m for the same period in 2020, the report said.\nJohnson & Johnson, which has manufactured a single-dose vaccine, has refused to grant a licence to a manufacturer offering to make millions more doses. Johnson & Johnson told Amnesty it had established 12 manufacturing and supply partnerships across four continents.\nWhile Novavax, which has yet to be approved for use, plans to provide almost two-thirds of its production supply to Covax, the report claims it has refused to share its knowledge and technology. Silvia Taylor, senior vice-president of global corporate affairs, told the Guardian: \u201cNovavax is committed to ensuring equitable global access to our vaccine.\u201d\nAlthough AstraZeneca, which has committed to selling its vaccines at cost price, has provided the majority of supplies for Covax to date, and has shared knowledge and technology with 20 supply partners, the company has refused to share its intellectual property more widely, the report claims.\nWhen approached by the Guardian, AstraZeneca claimed waiving intellectual property rights would not help meet global demand. A spokesperson said: \u201cIP is not the limiting factor but the time it takes to transfer the technical knowledge using a 1,000 page \u2018recipe book\u2019 to produce the vaccine, as well as the lack of specialised producers that can quickly set up the industrial capacity to make a safe and effective vaccine.\u201d\nAs of September 2021, Covid-19 has led to more than 4.5m deaths and 220m cases worldwide.",

Two officers were injured by bottles thrown at them and one was hospitalised with chest pains, Victoria police said.\nEarlier, up to 400 protesters had camped on the steps of the Shrine of Remembrance, lighting flares and throwing bottles, batteries, tap handles and golf balls at police.\nThe protests that have seized Australia\u2019s second-largest city for days had their genesis with members of the powerful Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), who were resisting a government mandate for compulsory coronavirus vaccinations for workers on building sites.\nBut the initial rally appears to have since been hijacked by far-right extremists, allegedly including neo-Nazis and anti-vaccination groups, who have organised via Telegram, Facebook and WhatsApp. Comments circulating on social media channels, seen by the Guardian, are explicitly racist, antisemitic, and include conspiracy theorist tropes.\nPrevious days had been dominated by people dressed in high-vis clothing \u2013 ostensibly tradespeople \u2013 but they were in the minority at Wednesday\u2019s protest.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t as many tradies as we could see \u2013 the group seemed much more mixed in terms of their motivations,\u201d the police deputy commissioner, Ross Guenther, said.\nFrom early Wednesday morning, hundreds of police lined Melbourne\u2019s streets.\nDespite callouts on social media channels, only a small number of people were seen outside the CFMEU\u2019s office in the central business district. Numbers swelled during the day but the crowds were significantly smaller than Monday and Tuesday.\nPolice in riot gear moved through the city throughout the morning, breaking up the protesters into smaller groups. About midday, the protesters left the city down St Kilda Road towards the shrine, where they sat on the steps outside the memorial.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nPolice followed and formed a line in front of the memorial blocking the protesters. Authorities urged demonstrators to \u201cleave peacefully via St Kilda Road\u201d.\n\u201cThere is safe passage to my right,\u201d a policeman told the crowd on a loudhailer. \u201cIf you go to St Kilda Road, you won\u2019t be arrested.\u201d\nThose who did leave by that route were fined $5,000 for breaching public health orders. But few agreed to depart.\nTowards the end of the protest, the mood of the crowd grew inconsistent: some were conciliatory and seeking to negotiate with police, others resolute they would not. \u201cThe Australian people do not negotiate with terrorists,\u201d one man yelled. \u201cYou\u2019re all fucking dogs,\u201d said another.\nThe group lacked any obvious direction and appeared unwilling to prosecute a list of demands or concerns.\nOne by one, protesters were pulled from the crowd by police when they refused to leave, some walking, some carried across the grass and arrested.\nShortly before 5pm, police advanced towards the final group holding out. Riot police, with weapons raised and firing foam baton rounds at protesters, overran the remaining protesters, supported by mounted officers. Police also used gas canisters to move the crowd on.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nEarlier, Victoria police applied for, and secured, a no-fly zone restriction over Melbourne, arguing that protesters were using livestreamed media coverage of the protests to coordinate movement and avoid police.\nThis no-fly order was later amended to allow media organisations to take aerial footage and broadcast it delayed by an hour.\nVeterans organisation the Returned Services League slammed the demonstration at the shrine, saying the site was \u201csacred and not a space of protest\u201d.\nIn the aftermath, the chief executive of the shrine, Dean Lee, said he had been left \u201cspeechless and appalled\u201d by the actions of protesters who commandeered the remembrance site.\n\u201cI cannot comprehend the selfishness of the people who would come to this sacred place and do this to Victoria\u2019s Shrine of Remembrance. It\u2019s outrageous, it\u2019s reprehensible and it\u2019s the most disgusting behaviour I could ever imagine witnessing here.\u201d\nThe Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has condemned the \u201cugly scenes\u201d. He defended his government\u2019s decision to shut down all construction in the state for two weeks after Monday\u2019s initial violence, saying the industry had been a dangerous vector for the spread of Covid-19, and had failed to heed public health mandates.\n\u201cToday there are more coronavirus cases in construction than there are in aged care,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more cases of coronavirus in the construction sector than there are patients with coronavirus in hospitals across the whole hospital system.\u201d\nThere have been 350 Covid-19 cases in the construction sector \u2013 which employs 320,000 workers \u2013 in the past two months across 150 different worksites.\nAndrews said only a fraction of those protesting were actual construction tradespeople and \u201cthey \u2026 should not be seen to reflect an entire industry\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not there to protest, they\u2019re there for a fight,\u201d the premier said.\nThe police minister, Lisa Neville, said police would deploy \u201cwhatever tactics\u201d were needed. \u201cThey have my full support in deploying whatever tactics they need to ensure these thugs, these violent thugs, are unable to cause further harm to our city and to our community,\u201d she said.",

An energy crisis is brewing; his phone is ringing off the hook. But he switches off the lights at his detached house in Wimbledon, gets in the car and drives. From his wealth-and-privilege accent and fashion choice of blue jeans and leather lace-ups, I assumed he was a Tory \u2013 but, in fact, he\u2019s a member of the fictional left-leaning Independent party.\nThis is Josh Joseph, AKA JJ (played by David Smith) and the film is his long night \u2013 and day \u2013 of the soul. There are a couple of interesting moments as he drives north listening to voicemails, and I enjoyed the camera right up against his face, registering his micro-expressions, the frustration and anxiety as he vents at an aide at the madness of a live debate with his opposite number in the shadow cabinet. (The government\u2019s policy to massively increase wind power is a dead-cert vote loser.)\nThe film completely unravels when JJ arrives at his destination, the postcard-pretty northern town where he grew up. He\u2019s here to confess undying love to a woman (Eliza Marsland) he knew as a teenager, when he was the lead singer in a Christian rock band. The pair walk in the woods talking earnestly with zero believability. He says he\u2019s not sure if he buys the scientists on global warming after all. I was baffled by the politics: is the film anti-climate change, or is the doubt a symptom of JJ\u2019s breakdown? It ends with him by the river having an audience with an anti-wind turbine activist (Ben Hynes). But here there\u2019s no confusing the meaning of JJ being dunked underwater by this beardy fella who speaks in fishing metaphors.\nI have admit to watching a lot of the movie imagining a The Thick of It version, with Malcom Tucker\u2019s running commentary of a wet minister off the leash and the hairdryer bollocking coming his way.\n True Calling is released on 24 September in cinemas.",

        "content": "Starmer wants a return to an electoral college for leadership elections and a new policymaking process\nKeir Starmer is set to reignite a Labour party row over how it selects its leadership, seeking to rewrite the rules that led to the rise of Jeremy Corbyn. Here\u2019s the lowdown on the changes.\nStarmer briefed his shadow cabinet that he would propose three new things at Labour conference: a return to an electoral college for leadership elections; a new reselection process for MPs; and a new policymaking process that does not involve \u201can endless series of motions at party conference\u201d.\nLabour members and supporters pick the leader based on a one-member, one-vote system. It means that all members, whether they are in the shadow cabinet or registered supporters or affiliated trade union members, have a vote of equal value.\nBut not all candidates make it to the members\u2019 ballot. Under changes brought in under Jeremy Corbyn, any MP who wishes to stand must receive nominations from not only 10% of MPs \u2013 a reduction from the previous rules \u2013 but also from local parties, unions and affiliates too.\nStarmer is proposing a change back to the old electoral college system \u2013 the same one that elected Ed Miliband. It was Miliband who then changed the system in 2014 to one member, one vote. The change back would mean that leaders are elected with a third of the vote coming from MPs, a third coming from trade unions and a third coming from members. It would give significantly more power to MPs to choose a future leader, but Starmer also plans to extend the vote to millions more trade union members.\nStarmer\u2019s team say he wants to strengthen the trade union link and give their members more power. They say the changes would also end many protracted internal debates about how the party makes policy and selects MPs. \u201cWe need party reforms that better connect us with working people and reorient us toward the voters who can take us to power,\u201d Starmer told his shadow cabinet.\nHowever, Starmer\u2019s allies on the NEC say this is also about showing a definite break with the Corbyn era. Starmer\u2019s hand is strengthened because internal analysis seen by the Guardian shows that the majority of Labour delegates \u2013 party members chosen by their local parties to attend and vote at conference \u2013 are pro-Starmer. That means Starmer has a chance \u2013 perhaps his only chance \u2013 to make some definitive reforms.\nSome leftwing unions, Unite, CWU and TSSA, have already said they will not back it and will push for any decision to be delayed. The power now lies with the GMB, Unison and Usdaw, whom Starmer must convince.\nThe big draw is that union members can currently vote in leadership elections only if they have actively signed up as affiliate Labour supporters. Starmer\u2019s proposal would extend the vote to all trade union members who pay the political levy on their union fees, potentially expanding the leadership electorate to more than 2 million people.\nThe electoral college system gives members far less power to decide who is Labour leader. It means that Labour\u2019s 400,000 members would have the same weight as Labour\u2019s 199 MPs. Momentum has called it \u201ca new low in Starmer\u2019s leadership\u201d and said his pledges of unity and leftwing policy made during the leadership campaign were \u201cbarefaced lies\u201d.\nStarmer\u2019s allies believe they can win the vote. But if one big union such as the GMB or Unison decides to vote against the changes, it will be incredibly tight and Starmer could lose.\nIf he does lose, his team say it will show nonetheless that he is willing to take risks, but it will be a humiliating start to a crucial conference.",

Shefir was not hit by the gunfire, which reportedly came from a forested area along the road.\nPhotographs showed police had marked at least 10 bullet holes in the black Audi sedan used by Shefir, a business partner of Zelenskiy for nearly two decades. The automatic gunfire was concentrated along the driver\u2019s side door, also striking the windscreen and a back tyre.\nPolice have not arrested any suspects. Moscow, which is engaged in a simmering proxy war with Kyiv in south-east Ukraine, has denied responsibility for the attack.\nZelenskiy said he would cut short a trip to New York after addressing the United Nations general assembly.\n\u201cI will honestly say that I don\u2019t know who was behind this,\u201d said Zelenskiy in a video message after the attack. \u201cThese could be internal or external forces. But I don\u2019t consider them to be strong because sending me a \u2018hello\u2019 by firing from a forest into the automobile of my friend is weakness.\n\u201cThis [attack] will not affect the strength of our team. This does not affect the path toward change that I have chosen with my team, for taking our economy out of the shadows, for the fight against criminal elements with large, influential financial groups \u2013 on the contrary, because the people of Ukraine gave us a mandate for change.\u201d\nShefir appeared at a news conference later on Wednesday, thanking emergency workers and his \u201chero\u201d driver, who is in critical condition.\n\u201cThe assassination attempt was carried out in an effort to frighten the upper echelon of government,\u201d Shefir said. \u201cBut you need to understand that the president \u2026 is a very strong-willed person who is not easily frightened.\u201d\nOleksandr Korniienko, the head of the president\u2019s political party, said Russia could be behind the attack, Reuters reported.\n\u201cA Russian trace should not be absolutely ruled out. We know their ability to organise terrorist attacks in different countries,\u201d Korniienko told reporters.\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with reality,\u201d said Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, referring to suggestions of Russia\u2019s involvement. \u201cRather, these are signs of an overexcited emotional state.\u201d\nLocal officials have been targeted in attacks in recent months in Ukraine. This month, a regional government emergency service spokesperson and a first aid volunteer helping the Ukrainian army were killed in a car bombing in Dnipro.\nBut the assassination attempt against Shefir is the highest-profile attack in recent memory.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be qualified as anything other than an attempt to demonstratively murder a key member of the team,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy\u2019s chief of staff, told local Ukrainian media.\nHe connected the attack to efforts to \u201csignificantly reduce the traditional influence of shadowy oligarchs on public matters\u201d, as well as criminal groups working for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cforeign opponents\u201d.\nZelenskiy\u2019s efforts at reducing the influence of powerful business interests in Ukraine have received mixed reviews. He made his name as a comic and producer on a television station owned by the tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, who was placed under sanctions by the US due to corruption allegations in March.\nUkraine\u2019s parliament is to debate a draft law on oligarchs this week that would define criteria for oligarchs and ban them from financing political parties or engaging in privatisations.",

McCrae is played by David Hayman, a fine actor who seems to get cast whenever a Scottish hard man is needed, but he\u2019s very much in a secondary role here. The anchoring protagonist is Chris Blythe (Ian Virgo), who has returned from Canada to his small Welsh home town somewhat in disgrace after he lost a fortune under murky circumstances. He gets a job working for McCrae, a swaggering terrier of a man who runs a quarry business and has a sexy daughter named Elen (Sianad Gregory, appropriately mesmerising).\nBefore you can say The Postman Always Rings Twice, Blythe and Elen are humping all over her bungalow, even though she warns him her dad will kill him if he finds out about them. But Blythe can\u2019t resist her minxy game-playing, especially the way she likes to wind him up by pretending to be upset or angry one minute and then laughing it off as a joke the next. Most people would just find that extremely annoying, but in erotic crime thrillers such as this, mercurial flirty lying seems to be the most bewitching pheromone imaginable, and the big lug duly falls for it.\nIf the plot sounds like a reworking of classic film noir tropes, no one seems to have mentioned that to director Chris Crow and his crew. Most of the scenes are shot in cheerful, green sunlight at picturesque locations, as if the Welsh Tourist Board were hired as a film crew to redo Double Indemnity but didn\u2019t know how to make a movie any other way. At least Gregory seems to be having fun vamping it up like mad, which makes up for the largely dull performances elsewhere.\n The Ballad of Billy McCrae is released in cinemas on 24 September.",

It is a delightful size, about the same as a Moleskine notebook, and only weighs 293g, meaning you can easily hold it with one hand for reading, note-taking or watching video.\nScreen: 8.9in 2266x1488 Liquid Retina display (326ppi)\nProcessor: Apple A15 Bionic\nRAM: 4GB\nStorage: 64 or 256GB\nOperating system: iPadOS 15\nCamera: 12MP rear and selfie cameras\nConnectivity: wifi 6 (5G optional, eSim), Bluetooth 5, USB-C, Touch ID\nDimensions: 195.4 x 134.8 x 6.3mm\nWeight: 293g (4G version: 297g)\nThe iPad mini is one of the first devices to ship with Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic processor, alongside the iPhone 13. Benchmarking shows similar processor performance to last year\u2019s A14 in the iPad Air, but with faster graphics. As such, the iPad mini is one of the most powerful tablets you can buy and performs excellently all round.\nThe battery lasts just over 10 hours when watching streaming video over wifi or a mix of browsing, emailing and light app use. Playing graphically intensive games or streaming over 5G will reduce the battery life, however. That\u2019s still more than enough to get through a commute or most flights.\nApple does not provide an estimated lifespan for the iPad mini\u2019s battery, but it can be replaced for \u00a399. Batteries in similar devices maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for at least 500 full charge cycles. The tablet is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being \u00a3326.44, which includes the screen.\nThe tablet has a 100% recycled aluminium body, 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board, 96% recycled rare earth elements, and at least 35% recycled plastic used in multiple components. Apple breaks down the tablet\u2019s environmental impact in its report.\nApple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\nThe iPad mini ships with iPadOS 15, which was released on Monday. The new multitasking tools are significantly easier to use and, despite the small size of the screen, make using two apps side-by-side useful for things such as keeping an eye on fantasy football while watching the game.\nThe quick notes feature is also particularly useful at this size, allowing you to jot down ideas or clip links, as you might with a paper notebook.\nBut it is the abundant app library that sets iPadOS above the competition, with everything from advanced learning and note-taking apps to desktop-class photo editors all available even on the mini.\nApple provides very long software support for its tablets, with some models receiving more than seven years of updates from release, meaning you can safely use them for longer.\nThe iPad mini has Apple\u2019s gamechanging 12-megapixel automatic panning and zooming video call camera from this year\u2019s iPad Pro. It works just as well, keeping you in frame whether on your own, in a group or moving around \u2013 a feature usually found on high-end video conference solutions and a few smart displays.\nThe screen exhibits a little of the so-called \u201cjelly scroll\u201d effect when used in portrait orientation, a problem common to larger touchscreen devices where one side of the screen reacts faster than the other when you drag your finger on it to scroll the page.\nThe iPad mini does not have a smart connector for attaching a keyboard or other accessories, but can still be used with Bluetooth or USB-C keyboards.\nThe base model only has 64GB of storage, which will be fine if you mostly stream content and don\u2019t install lots of large apps, but may be tight if you want to download lots of video or photos.\nThe iPad mini starts at \u00a3479 ($499/$A749) with 64GB of storage, or \u00a3619 ($649/A$979) with 256GB. 5G models cost an additional \u00a3140 ($150/A$230).\nFor comparison, the 10.2in iPad costs \u00a3319, the iPad Air costs \u00a3579 and the iPad Pro costs from \u00a3749, Amazon\u2019s Fire HD 8 costs \u00a390, the Fire HD 10 costs \u00a3150, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S7 costs \u00a3519 and the Galaxy Z Fold 3 costs \u00a31,599.\nThe iPad mini is without doubt the best small tablet you can buy, but unlike most rivals at this size it is not a cheap machine.\nThe screen is excellent and big enough to be usable for most things despite the tablet\u2019s almost-pocketable size. It has a really powerful chip, solid 10-hour battery life, USB-C and iPadOS with a huge library of quality apps. The Centre Stage camera is super for video calls. It can even be used with the Apple Pencil, which turns it into a great digital Moleskine notebook replacement.\nI\u2019m sure the original iPad mini\u2019s many fans will love this reinvigorated version. It is better all round and built to last. But the cheaper, larger 10.2in iPad offers much more for your money, and the bigger iPad Air is more useful as a computer replacement. That leaves the mini most desirable for those who want a secondary note-taking tablet or need the smallest iPad in space-constrained applications where a \u00a390 Android tablet won\u2019t do.\nPros: compact design, great performance, 10-hour battery life, great screen, USB-C, iPadOS, plenty of apps, great speakers, great mics, brilliant video-call camera, very long software support, recycled aluminium.\nCons: expensive, small size is cramped for some applications, no smart keyboard support, relatively small storage on the starting model with no way to add more.\nApple iPad Air 2020 review: a cheaper iPad Pro for the rest of us\nApple iPad Pro M1 review: stunning screen and so much power\nApple iPad 2020 review: all the iPad you need, none of the tablet you don\u2019t\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S7+ review: Android tablet to rival the iPad Pro\nFire HD 10 Plus (2021) review: Amazon\u2019s top budget tablet upgraded\nAmazon Fire HD 8 review: \u00a390 tablet revamped for 2020\nGalaxy Z Fold 3 review: Samsung\u2019s cutting-edge water resistant phone-tablet hybrid",

        "content": "Ministers try to avert supermarket shortages through emergency deal that will cost taxpayer \u2018millions\u2019\nMinisters have tried to avert a supermarket stock shortage crisis by using taxpayer money to bail out a private US firm that produces carbon dioxide.\nThe emergency deal was designed to stop the UK\u2019s supply chains grinding further to a halt, and will last for three weeks.\nIt is a complicated issue that cut across political decisions, energy prices and access to food. So what does it all mean and why does it matter?\nThe UK relies heavily on two plants to make most of its carbon dioxide, operated by CF Fertilisers in Teesside and Cheshire. These supply about 60% of CO2 that the UK needs for making fizzy drinks including beer, stunning animals before slaughter for meat production and making dry ice to keep food fresh for storage and transport.\nCF Fertilisers makes the gas as a byproduct of its main output \u2013 fertiliser \u2013 but its two operations ground to a halt last week when the cost of wholesale gas prices rocketed.\nIceland supermarket\u2019s managing director, Richard Walker, said problems would begin in days \u2013 not months, adding: \u201cThis is no longer about whether or not Christmas will be OK, it\u2019s about keeping the wheels turning and the lights on so we can actually get to Christmas.\u201d\nThe shortages also poured fuel on the fire of much greater problems with supply chains, caused in part by a lack of labour \u2013 from fruit pickers on farms to lorry drivers who deliver the goods.\nPoorer people were already bracing for a difficult winter, with the cut to the \u00a320 universal credit uplift looming and Boris Johnson\u2019s 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions for workers and businesses.\nIn an attempt to head off headlines harking back to the 1970s questioning whether the government could keep the lights on, ministers intervened.\nTalks were held to try to get CF Fertilisers to restart production and late on Tuesday night, it was announced operations would resume immediately at its Billingham plant in Teesside, though the Cheshire site will remain closed.\nThe details remain a secret, but the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it had brokered a deal to \u201censure the continued supply of CO2\u201d \u2013 calling it an \u201can essential component of the national economy\u201d.\nIt was hailed as an \u201cexceptional, short-term agreement\u201d with the private US company, lasting just three weeks, that would see taxpayer cash used to provide \u201climited financial support\u201d for CF Fertilisers\u2019 operating costs while the market \u201cadapts to global gas prices\u201d.\nThe bill will run to \u201cmany million, possibly tens of millions\u201d, the environment secretary, George Eustice, told Sky News on Wednesday. He told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m not going into the precise figure because government lawyers are working on the terms of the deal \u2026 it\u2019s a commercial arrangement.\u201d\nEustice said a \u201cperfect storm\u201d had been created because other factories that produce CO2 were also closed \u2013 but that when they reopened in a few weeks\u2019 time, the market would be able to readjust.\nHe said: \u201cThere is another factory in the UK, but that\u2019s currently closed for maintenance. There\u2019s also another factory that we often get supplies from in Norway, that\u2019s also closed for maintenance.\n\u201cSo we have this perfect storm of two plants closing because they don\u2019t have a market for their fertiliser and because prices have risen, and because two other plants are currently closed for maintenance. Once those plants reopened, then we\u2019ll be back into a properly functioning normal market.\u201d\nJonathan Brearley, the chief executive of the energy regulator, Ofgem, said the wider issue of wholesale gas prices would not go away.\nHe told MPs at a select committee that the cost rise \u201creally is something that we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen before at this pace\u201d, and added: \u201cUnfortunately when you see costs like this change, ultimately that will feed through to customers.\u201d\nThere is pressure on the government to get CF to restart operations at its Cheshire plant, too. The British Retail Consortium\u2019s director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said it was \u201cvital\u201d work at the second site was \u201crestarted as soon as possible, and distributed quickly to food manufacturers in need of it\u201d.\nThe Tory former business minister Robert Halfon has also called for the government to consider scrapping or reducing the 5% VAT on energy bills.\nMinisters are also considering state-backed loans to help the UK\u2019s large energy suppliers pick up potentially millions of unprofitable energy customers ahead of a \u201ctsunami\u201d of supplier collapses this winter. Another option being discussed is a \u201cbad bank\u201d-style company to take on the customers left stranded by energy company failures to ensure they continue to receive energy at the price they agreed to pay.",

And there are plenty of people in that building behind me who certainly want a deal.\u201d\nBut Johnson did announce a resumption in UK lamb exports. \u201cI can tell you today that what we\u2019re going to get from the United States now is a lifting of the decades-old ban, totally unjustified, discriminating on British farmers and British lamb. It\u2019s about time too.\u201d\nThe US banned the import of UK beef and lamb in 1989 after the outbreak of BSE in some British cows. The ban of beef imports was lifted a year ago.\nOne perceived obstacle to a formal trade deal is worries in the Biden White House and among some Congress members about the possible impact of Brexit on peace in Northern Ireland, including tensions about the implementation of border checks.\nJohnson contradicted the official Downing Street account of his meeting with the US president, which said the PM had \u201cupdated President Biden on the developments with respect to the Northern Ireland protocol since they last met in June\u201d.\nAsked if he agreed with comments earlier on Wednesday by the environment secretary, George Eustice, that Biden did not fully understand the protocol, Johnson said: \u201cNo. The president, actually, in our meeting yesterday \u2013 I don\u2019t think it came up at all.\u201d\nSeparately, Johnson sought to give more reassurance about the looming energy crisis, rejecting the idea that rising gas prices could lead to panic-buying in supermarkets.\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that will happen. I think we\u2019ve got very good supply chains, as I\u2019ve been saying over the last few days, and what we\u2019re seeing is the growing pains of a global economy recovering rapidly from Covid.\u201d",

The first came when she asked him how much the combined universal credit and national insurance changes would reduce the salary of someone earning \u00a318,000 a year, citing \u201ca travel agent\u201d as an example.\n\u201cThe UC uplift was always meant to be temporary,\u201d Raab replied. \u201cWe paid the wages of nearly 12 million workers through this pandemic. We are coming out with rising jobs, rising wages. We would have done none of that if we\u2019d taken her advice, and not come out of lockdown.\u201d\nRayner told him the total loss would be more than \u00a31,100, then asked: \u201cThe deputy prime minister has said the solution is for people to work harder. So can he tell us how many days a worker on the minimum wage would have to work this year in order to afford a night at a luxury hotel, say, in Crete?\u201d\nRaab responded: \u201cIf she wants to talk about taxes and easing the burden on the lowest paid, I\u2019ll remind her, whenever the Labour party has gone into government, the economy has nosedived, unemployment has soared and taxes have gone through the roof.\u201d\nThe exchanges continued in a similar fashion, with Rayner asking Raab to guarantee people would not be pushed into fuel poverty or lose energy this winter, saying ministers had not properly prepared for the crisis over gas supplies.\n\u201cTheir failures has paved the way for this crisis that will hit families and businesses. And as usual, it will be the British people that will have to pay the price,\u201d Rayner said, adding: \u201cMaybe he should go back to his sun lounger and let me take over.\u201d",

He, his daughter, Yulia, and a police officer, DS Nick Bailey, were poisoned but survived.\nIn June 2018, Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother of three, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, were poisoned after he found a fake perfume bottle containing novichok. Rowley recovered but Sturgess died on 8 July. One of the mysteries, which it is hoped an inquiry might uncover, is the gap between the attack on the Skripals and the poisoning of Sturgess.\nA former high court judge, Heather Hallett, is in charge of the inquest process but on Wednesday said she too wanted the home secretary to \u201cconvert\u201d it into a public inquiry, which would be able to consider sensitive information in secret and enable her to consider the role played by the Russian state. She is keen for the full hearing to begin by the end of next year if possible.\nCounsel to the inquest, Andrew O\u2019Connor QC, said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Patel had not already indicated whether she would agree to a public inquiry. \u201cIt is a matter of considerable regret that the secretary of state has not engaged more constructively,\u201d he said.\nO\u2019Connor said it appeared the Home Office had decided it would have been \u201ctoo burdensome\u201d for Patel to have read \u201coverarching reports\u201d on the case and consulted cabinet colleagues.\nCathryn McGahey QC, counsel for the government, said Patel would aim to make a decision on a public inquiry by Christmas and conceded that starting a hearing at the end of 2022 was \u201cpossibly ambitious\u201d.\nOn Tuesday, the Metropolitan police named Denis Sergeev, who allegedly used the alias Sergey Fedotov while in the UK, as the third Russian spy to face charges over the poisonings. Hallett said she planned to look at his alleged role as part of her investigation.",

        "content": "Researchers say children\u2019s mouthing behaviour and products such as bottles may be to blame\nInfants have more microplastics in their faeces than adults, a study has found.\nMicroplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5mm in size that have been released into the environment from the breakage of bigger plastic objects. They are a threat to the environment because they do not easily biodegrade, and recent research has found them in dust, food, fruit, bottled water and, as a result, animal and human faeces.\nHuman exposure to microplastics is a possible health concern, but little is known about its extent. In a small study, researchers from New York University School of Medicine discovered that infants have 10 to 20 times higher microplastic concentrations in their stool than adults, specifically when it comes to PET (polyethylene terephthalate) microplastics. These are used mainly in the production of textile fibres, water bottles and mobile phone cases, for example.\n\u201cHuman exposure to microplastics is a health concern,\u201d said Kurunthachalam Kannan, a professor in the paediatrics department at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the lead researcher on the study. \u201cWe need to make efforts to reduce exposure in children. Children\u2019s products should be made free of plastics.\u201d\nThe research is published in the American Chemical Society\u2019s Environmental Science and Technology Letters.\nIt has been estimated that the average person can ingest up to 5 grams of microplastic a week. Some of the microplastics pass seamlessly through the digestive system and are expelled in faeces, some microplastics are accumulated within bodily organs, and recent research has shown that some pieces cross cell membranes and enter the bloodstream. Other studies have shown generational transmission of microplastics from pregnant mothers to their baby\u2019s placenta.\nNot much is known about how microplastics affect and possibly damage the human body, but some tests on laboratory animals have shown inflammation, cell shutdown and metabolic issues.\nBy analysing the faeces of six infants and 10 adults, and three newborns\u2019 first stool, through a method called mass spectrometry, Kannan and his team looked into human exposure to two common microplastics \u2013 PET and polycarbonate (PC). Every sample had at least one type of microplastic in it.\nThe level of PC microplastics were roughly the same in adults and infants, but infants had 10 to 20 times higher levels of PET microplastics.\n\u201cWe were surprised to find higher levels in infants than adults, but later tried to understand various sources of exposure in infants,\u201d Kannan said. \u201cWe found that infants\u2019 mouthing behaviour, such as crawling on carpets and chewing on textiles, as well as various products used for children including teethers, plastic toys, feeding bottles, utensils such as spoons \u2026 can all contribute to such exposure.\u201d\nThese findings are in line with those of other studies, albeit few, that have looked into microplastic contamination in human stools, said Scott Coffin, a research scientist at the California State Water Resources Control Board who was not involved in the research. If anything, these results suggest that current estimates of exposure to microplastics are likely underrepresentative, Coffin said, quoting the study he believes to be the most rigorous assessment to date, conducted by researchers at the Wageningen University and Research.\n\u201cA component that is not accounted for in this study is the accumulation of microplastics into organs following exposure,\u201d said Coffin. Excretion of all microplastics ingested is unlikely in humans, Coffin said, so the levels overall might be even higher. This, among many other details, is still to be ironed out in future studies.\nFor example, there is a possibility of contamination during the experiment when dealing with faeces and microplastics (contamination from diapers, for example, or from the scientific equipment itself). Plus, the analytical method used to calculate the mass of microplastics in faeces is relatively uncommon, according to Coffin, and has not yet to his knowledge undergone robust validation.\nOverall, the exposure to and hazards of microplastics to humans are poorly understood, but Coffin said the study provided much-needed preliminary data.",

We\u2019re in discussion with [energy regulator] Ofgem officials, looking at all options,\u201d Kwarteng told the business select committee.\nThe windfall tax in Spain will target companies that have made \u201cexcess profits\u201d from the fast-rising energy market prices. This will be used to create a fund to cover the cost of infrastructure investments and taxes that would otherwise have come from household energy bills.\nThe move has been strongly opposed by companies, including owners of nuclear power plants that are not exposed to higher energy costs but are able to sell their electricity for far higher prices.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of windfall taxes,\u201d the business secretary added. \u201cBut of course [the energy system] is an entire system and we have to think about how we can get the energy system as a whole to help itself.\u201d\nKwarteng said safeguarding energy consumers was a government priority in its plans to tackle the deepening gas crisis, which has caused UK gas markets to climb more than fourfold in the last year after a global boom in gas demand.\nThe minister downplayed the role of Britain\u2019s meagre gas storage facilities as a cause for the UK\u2019s record gas market prices, saying the issue was \u201ca red herring\u201d.\nJonathan Brearley, the chief executive of the regulator Ofgem, told the committee the recent gas market price rises were \u201csomething we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen before, at this pace\u201d.\n\u201cWe do expect a large number of customers to be affected. We\u2019ve already seen hundreds of thousands of customers affected. It may go well above that,\u201d he added.\nBrearley declined to comment on how many energy suppliers may survive the coming winter. Kwarteng said he did not expect the number to shrink to 10, contrary to some analyst predictions.\nTwo more energy suppliers, Avro and Green, went bust on Wednesday, adding to the five other small suppliers that have ceased trading in recent weeks.\nThe government is expected to focus its support on protecting the potentially millions of customers who may lose their energy supplier this winter in a wave of company collapses, rather than prop up failing businesses.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is to give taxpayer money to companies which have come into the market only to exit the market after a year. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsible,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the government\u2019s energy price cap would remain in place to ensure households pay a fair price for their energy.\nThe Guardian understands that the government is also considering higher winter fuel payments, warm home discounts and cold weather payments. It may also bring forward changes to the warm home discount proposed for 2022, which would make another 780,000 people eligible for the financial help.\nMinisters are expected to confirm the exact level of financial support it will offer the energy industry at the end of next month, as part of the autumn budget and the upcoming government spending review.\nThe government is also under pressure to address the UK\u2019s carbon dioxide shortage triggered by the shutdown of two fertiliser plants, owned by the US company CF Industries \u2013 which provide 60% of the UK\u2019s CO2 \u2013 due to the record gas prices.\nEarlier this week, the government agreed to provide \u201climited financial support\u201d for CF Fertilisers\u2019 operating costs for three weeks while the UK\u2019s food, drinks and meat production industries negotiate new supply contracts to secure CO2.\nKwarteng told MPs: \u201cIn a critical intervention like that you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. That\u2019s why I think in a critical period we needed a very short-term arrangement.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem.\u201d\nBoris Johnson dismissed suggestions that the issues with gas prices could lead to panic buying in supermarkets. The prime minister told reporters in Washington DC: \u201cI don\u2019t think that will happen. I think we\u2019ve got very good supply chains \u2026 and what we\u2019re seeing is the growing pains of a global economy recovering rapidly from Covid.\u201d",

        "content": "Controversial proposals for T\u00fcbingen are an attempt to deter car use in the city, with larger vehicles paying the most\nThe mayor of the southern German city of T\u00fcbingen has attracted praise and scorn alike for a new plan to increase parking fees by 600% in an effort to discourage cars \u2013 especially large ones \u2013 from the city.\nBoris Palmer, a member of the Greens party, has won initial support for his proposal, which would see the annual parking fee for SUVs rise from 30 euros to 180.\nPalmer had originally pushed for a fee of 360 euros, but did not secure sufficient backing from city officials in the climate committee.\nAccording to the Stuttgarter Zeitung, the top fee of 180 euros will apply to cars with combustion engines more than 1800 kg in weight, as well as electric cars weighing more than 2000 kg.\nPalmer said that people on social security will pay half the regular fee. Exceptions are also due to be made for people with disabilities and care workers dependent on their vehicles to be able to carry out their job.\nPalmer, whose controversial proposals and statements regularly make headlines beyond the university city where he has been mayor for 14 years, said the aim of the parking fee was to persuade car drivers to leave their vehicles at home and use public transport instead.\n\u201cThere should be a noticeable difference between the fees small city cars and big sport utility vehicles have to pay, which actually aren\u2019t needed in the city,\u201d he argued.\nLike other German cities, T\u00fcbingen aims to become climate neutral by 2030, requiring the huge expansion and increased accessibility of its public transport system. Central to the plan will be making it cheaper to use. Revenue from the increased parking fees is due to flow back into financing public transport. Other towns and cities are piloting similar schemes and the T\u00fcbingen proposals have won the broad support of environmental campaigners.\nThe final decision is to be met by the local council at the end of this month, but Palmer has reportedly secured the necessary backing as the backbone of the climate protection programme the council has in principal agreed upon.\nPalmer initially laid out his argument for the increases this summer on Facebook, using the frank language for which he has become well known across Germany.\nAddressing \u2018dear car drivers\u2019, he said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t pay for the roads. Neither do you pay enough taxes. Your favourite form of transport is massively subsidised as it is, by all other taxpayers and the next generation. If the prices were to reflect the real amount you should be paying, a parking space would have to cost not 30 Euros a year, but 3000.\u201d\nThe ensuing backlash saw Palmer stand accused by one T\u00fcbingen resident of \u201cconducting a personal campaign against cars and their owners\u201d.\nPalmer replied he was \u201conly against people who want other people to pay for their parking space, and then go on to moan on top of that\u201d, and accused Germans of getting too emotional about their cars.\nPalmer has previously been threatened with expulsion by the Greens after making remarks considered racist over a depiction of multicultural Germany in an advert by the national rail operator Deutsche Bahn, as well as for criticising a footballer in remarks for which he was also widely accused of racism.",

        "content": "The playmaker has gone to Qatar after becoming an expensive spare part at a club both right and wrong to sign him\nJames Rodr\u00edguez has gone to Qatar in search of work, although unlike many others who have made the trip before him he can at least keep his passport and will be allowed to leave whenever he wants. The bewitching Colombian playmaker has signed a contract with Al-Rayyan, bringing down the curtain on his Everton career, and \u2013 you suspect \u2013 much else besides.\nThe first thing to be said is that this is probably for the best all round. Ever since the sudden departure of Carlo Ancelotti to Real Madrid Rodr\u00edguez had felt like an expensive spare part in a team increasingly based on hard running and well-organised defence. The new manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, had no use for him. Rodr\u00edguez is not only 30 and at about \u00a3220,000 a week the highest-paid player in the club\u2019s history, but highly injury-prone and last season ran the least of all Everton\u2019s attacking players. There is a sense of inevitability here.\nMuch of the initial fervour and excitement that greeted Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s arrival from Real Madrid a year ago had long since dissipated, on both sides. \u201cOn the weekend I will not play, I don\u2019t even know who Everton is playing, can you please tell me?\u201d Rodr\u00edguez asked fans during a live Twitch stream last month. \u201cOh, Leeds? A difficult game. Let\u2019s see what happens. Hopefully they win.\u201d\nPerhaps everyone should have seen this coming. Perhaps everyone did see this coming. And if there is an element of sadness here it is because the story of Rodr\u00edguez at Everton will probably go down as an entirely avoidable folly: a reckless low-percentage decision that anyone could see would likely end in injuries and apathy and a financial problem that could hamper the club for years.\nBut these were the very same elements that made Rodr\u00edguez such a bold, fascinating, romantic signing. Part of the basic appeal of this transfer \u2013 and why it deserves to be remembered far more fondly than it probably will \u2013 was that it made no sense whatsoever. And never was this truer than during those few tantalising occasions on which when Rodr\u00edguez and Everton made music together.\nIt was a brief flirtation, as these things go: a stunning introduction against Tottenham on the opening game of the season, a two-goal burst against Brighton in October, a screamer against Manchester United, a brilliant assist for Richarlison in the 2-0 win at Anfield in February. Most of all there was that silhouette: the gentle lean back, the smooth arc of that left foot, arms delicately outstretched for balance. In both aesthetic and numerical terms \u2013 six goals and nine assists in all competitions \u2013 his one season at Goodison was at least a partial success.\nAnd yet even in those gossamer autumn days, when Rodr\u00edguez was picking apart Premier League defences for fun, it still felt fragile and fleeting and probably unwise. In a sense Rodr\u00edguez was the ultimate emblem of the wild, untamed ambition of the Ancelotti years, when Everton briefly dreamed themselves into the big time again. Their twin departures, by contrast, offer a stiff jolt of reality, a cold and boring reminder that status is accrued not through star signings but through a gradual process of sound recruitment, clear values, a results-oriented culture, yada yada, and so on.\nFor the star of the 2014 World Cup it probably marks the end of his top-class career. Few players manage to enhance their playing reputations in Qatar \u2013 among the league\u2019s stars these days are Santi Cazorla, Toby Alderweireld and Javi Mart\u00ednez, all in various forms of decline \u2013 and despite his relative youth it is hard to see Rodr\u00edguez bucking that trend. For all he has achieved, there remains a sense of frustration that a player of such rich talent has been unable to harness it fully, that what could have been a glittering career is essentially reducible to a handful of moments.\nMeanwhile Everton, in the dual grip of Ben\u00edtez and financial fair play considerations, are a more sensible club these days. They sign sensible, can-do players such as Andros Townsend and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n. They have sensibly kicked their addiction to flighty No 10s who don\u2019t press. They sensibly got knocked out of the Carabao Cup by QPR on Tuesday night. And now they have sensibly offloaded a player who was costing them \u00a31m a month and didn\u2019t know who they were playing at the weekend.\nIn a way, the Rodr\u00edguez saga encapsulates perfectly the two universes of football. In one, you reconcile yourself to your financial realities, trust the data, pick a recruitment strategy and stick to it. In the other, if you get the chance to sign James Rodr\u00edguez, you sign James Rodr\u00edguez. It was a pipe dream, a childish punt, a beautiful doomed marriage. It was rash and foolish and daring and everyone knew how it was going to end. But you wanted to watch anyway.",

With $300bn (\u00a3220bn) owed to its creditors and key debt interest payments due on Thursday, the firm\u2019s troubles have rattled global financial markets.\nAs the second biggest property firm operating in the largest sector of the world\u2019s second largest economy, it is clear why investors are worried, with some drawing parallels to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. It also comes as a significant test for China\u2019s president Xi Jinping, as Beijing attempts to curb financial risks and concentrations of wealth while trying to limit the economic impact.\nAdam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, said that while comparisons to 2008 were being drawn, there were differences. The property market is undergoing a correction which has to some extent been planned, with Xi imposing economic reforms.\n\u201cUnlike the disastrous chain reaction at Lehman, this is a controlled demolition, deliberately triggered by the regime,\u201d said Tooze.\n\u201cBeijing is doing what critics have been asking China to do for a while \u2013 to deflate the housing bubble. It is doing what the west did not do in 2007-2008, ie use regulatory intervention to manage a hard landing short of an outright crash.\u201d\nFor years there have been concerns raised about soaring levels of corporate debt in China, with rapid growth to more than 160% of GDP. The International Monetary Fund has previously warned the explosion in debt could trigger the next global financial crisis.\nOn Wednesday, Evergrande moved to placate investors with a pledge to pay $36m (\u00a326m) in interest payments due on its domestic bonds on Thursday. The company is still due to pay $84m on a separate US dollar bond. However, the signal that it has some cash ready for investor payouts helped to lift Asian financial markets.\nAfter opening lower, the Shanghai composite index closed up 0.4% on Wednesday, while the Shenzhen benchmark fell 0.6%. Markets remained closed in Hong Kong and South Korea for the mid-autumn festival.\nAgainst a backdrop of investor concern, China\u2019s central bank announced it would pump $14bn into the banking system. Financial markets around the world rallied on Wednesday, with the FTSE 100 up more than 1%.\n\u201cThis is not China\u2019s \u2018Lehman moment\u2019,\u201d said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cChina\u2019s authorities will neither allow a complete collapse, nor risk a financial crisis, to make a point about moral hazard.\u201d\nInstead, analysts expect Beijing\u2019s push to tackle indebted companies will follow the route of managed decline, demonstrated by intervention from the central bank. Bondholders are likely to face losses, but homebuyers and suppliers are expected to be protected.\nIt is not a process without risk. Analysts expect the fallout to weigh down China\u2019s economy, after years of the property sector \u2013 which accounts for 29% of GDP \u2013 serving as a powerful engine of economic growth. Parallels with a consumer debt crisis in Korea in 2003 are being drawn, when a massive credit card lending boom was followed by a painful bust, holding back growth as households reined in their spending.\n\u201cEvergrande is like Lehman in that it has speculated on real estate. It has a lot of debt spread across the entire Chinese economy and Chinese society. It is opaque. It is worrying,\u201d said Tooze.\n\u201cBut is Evergrande really Lehman? Closer examination suggests that the Evergrande crisis is not like Lehman at all.\u201d",

But it is now thought that swinging their tails reduced the muscular effort required to propel themselves forwards, meaning they could run faster.\nTo better understand how Coelophysis bauri \u2013 a small, meat-eating dinosaur that relied on speed and agility to catch its prey \u2013 might have moved based on its physiology, Peter Bishop at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, US, and colleagues constructed a 3D simulation using CT scans of dinosaur bones and digital models of how the skeleton would have fitted together.\nCrucially, this simulation enabled them to predict which movement patterns would have maximised certain goals, such as running faster. And the impact of altering or removing certain body segments, such as the tail. The simulations unexpectedly revealed that the dinosaur made pronounced movements with its neck and long heavy tail as it moved.\n\u201cIt is not like a dog wagging its tail when it is excited. It is a modest wag, but it is very precisely timed with the forwards and backwards swinging of the legs,\u201d said Bishop, whose research was published in Science Advances. \u201cJust as we humans swing our arms when we\u2019re walking or running, we think it\u2019s about balancing and counterbalancing the movement of the other body segments.\u201d\nThe team also investigated the impact of removing the tail: doing so meant that the simulated dinosaur had to apply 18% more muscle effort as it moved, suggesting that the tail may also have reduced Coelophysis\u2019s energy expenditure \u2013 another reason why humans swing their arms when they walk.\n\u201cWhen we chopped the tail off, the dinosaur was effectively having to wag its hips to compensate for the loss of the tail,\u201d Bishop said.\nHe believes the findings could also inform how other two-legged dinosaurs, including giants such as Tyrannosaurus rex, moved. \u201cThese simulations give us a much better understanding of what these creatures were like as living animals, which enables us to build up a better picture of the history of life, and an appreciation of how we got to the animals and plants we have today,\u201d said Bishop.\nUnderstanding these unique, extinct body plans could also provide inspiration for new and more efficient types of robots, he added.",

We owe it [to] our party volunteers, donors, members and activists to critically examine every aspect of the campaign,\u201d Mark Strahl, a re-elected Conservative in British Columbia wrote on Twitter, adding that the party \u201clost a solid, diverse group\u201d of lawmakers on Monday.\nOnly weeks before, polling had suggested the Conservatives were pulling ahead of the Liberals and even had a shot at forming a government.\nThe campaign was soon put on the defensive, however, over O\u2019Toole\u2019s unclear stance on banning assault-style rifles. He also faced growing criticism and questions after not requiring Conservative candidates to be vaccinated \u2013 even as he promised to increase vaccine rates across the country to 90%.\n\u201cOne of the problems that Mr O\u2019Toole faces is the problem of authenticity. This is true for Canadians who are paying attention \u2013 but it\u2019s particularly true for his base,\u201d said St\u00e9phanie Chouinard, a professor of political science at the Royal Military College of Canada.\nO\u2019Toole, a former air force navigator, ran as a \u201ctrue blue\u201d conservative during the 2020 leadership election, hoping to appeal to more socially conservative factions of the party.\nBut he quickly pivoted to the centre, advertising himself as a moderate leader, an ally to the LGBTQ community who was pro-choice on abortion and often highlighted the need to fight the climate crisis. Much to the frustration of his base, he also put a price on emissions, though repeatedly refused to call it a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not your dad\u2019s Conservative party any more,\u201d he often told supporters.\n\u201cThis was a good strategy in order to gain the Conservative leadership. And I know why he tried to pull his party towards the centre during this campaign. Some of the ideological leanings of a sizable part of his party \u2013 on abortion, LGBTQ rights, the environment and gun control \u2013 are just not palatable to the average Canadian,\u201d said Chouinard.\nBut the results raise broader questions about the future of O\u2019Toole\u2019s party, which has seen consecutive losses under socially conservative and socially progressive candidates.\nIf the party opts to turf out O\u2019Toole and hold a leadership race, Chouinard suspects a rightwing candidate would probably win.\n\u201cBut a shift to the right means totally alienating urban voters, as well as the vast majority of Quebec,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is becoming a real problem for the conservatives.\u201d\nWhile the party had success in the Prairies and made inroads in the Atlantic provinces, the vast majority of electoral districts \u2013 and the path to a parliamentary majority \u2013 lie in Quebec and Ontario.\nGreater Toronto has far more electoral seats up for grabs than the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador combined. And as of Monday, the Liberals swept virtually all races in the region.\nIn his concession speech on Monday, O\u2019Toole said he remained committed to the party\u2019s goals \u2013 and repeatedly warned that another election was on the horizon.\n\u201cThat speech, brandishing the threat of another election, was really him pleading to get a second shot,\u201d said Chouinard. \u201cWhether he\u2019ll be able to sell that idea to a fringe of his party, a group that\u2019s rather mad at the campaign that he ran \u2026 is going to be a tough sell.\u201d",

        "content": "No game over the Souths coach\u2019s long and decorated career has promised as much emotion as Friday\u2019s preliminary final\nRugby league in Australia is 114 years old. That Wayne Bennett has coached at premiership level for 46 of those is remarkable. The possibility that this weekend could be the last time he leads a team is difficult to comprehend. Rugby league without Bennett seems as foreign as a footy game with no pies or a pub with no beer.\nSince taking over Ipswich at the tender age of 26 and then moving to the Brisbane Rugby League with Souths and then Brothers, Bennett has been a constant at the highest level of the game, a fixture synonymous not only with success but also with the game itself. It has been an astonishing career during which he has won seven premierships at two different clubs, built a club into a preeminent force and led teams to grand finals in four different decades. He is favoured to do so in a fifth. He has won Origin and Test series and awards and accolades.\nPerhaps the biggest nod to his ability, though, is his longevity. Since getting tapped to coach Souths in the BRL in 1977, there have been just two years he has not helmed a club in either the BRL, NSWRL/ARL or NRL. The last was 1986, when he coached Queensland for the first time. He guided Canberra to their first grand final in 1987 and has not missed a season since.\nBennett has coached more consecutive seasons than the length of eight clubs\u2019 existence. That in itself is an imprint on the game as big as any figure in history.\nAcross 972 games, Bennett has shown the Raiders how to win, built the Broncos from nothing, returned the Saints to their former glory, saw lows for the first time with the Knights, brought the Broncos back to the dance and then built something truly special at the Rabbitohs.\nOver that long and decorated career, though, no game has promised as much emotion as Friday night\u2019s preliminary final against Manly. For the first time in his storied calling, Bennett has no job to go to. At 71, this could be it.\nCoaches make their money from their ability to motivate. They know what buttons to push and when. That is the art of coaching and what separates the likes of Bennett, Craig Bellamy and Trent Robinson from the scientists such as Michael Maguire, Ricky Stuart and so many others who have not found the capacity to master motivation. It is extraordinarily rare that a coach, in and of himself, will play a major role in the motivation of a premiership push.\nAt Souths this year, though, there is no doubt Bennett\u2019s departure is playing a significant role in driving his team towards the title. Bennett has been at South Sydney only three seasons but is already a beloved figure at Redfern. He has always been a player\u2019s coach; there is little question he has enjoyed the players at Souths as much as any other group. He has also bought into the history of the club, respecting its culture by bringing his style and class to an organisation with an already well-cemented identity. Adam Reynolds, Cody Walker, Benji Marshall \u2026 they all love their coach.\nThere is also a deep admiration for the extraordinarily rare clean transition of power Bennett has instigated as he prepares to hand the reins to assistant Jason Demetriou after this campaign. There has been no destabilisation, no untruths, no collateral damage. This should not be understated in evaluating the mindset of Souths players in the lead-up to what is not only an incredibly important game for the club but potentially a historic farewell for its coach.\nShould South Sydney go on to win this competition, Bennett would become the first coach to lead three different clubs to a premiership and will equal Arthur Holloway\u2019s record eight overall. His gap of 30 seasons between his first title and his last will also tie Holloway\u2019s record of longevity.\nSouths, of course, have been here before. The Rabbitohs have lost at the preliminary-final stage the last three years. But this one is different. In none of the last three seasons have Souths enjoyed a week off, nor have they been favoured in betting. This year they are well rested and are favoured to down the Sea Eagles.\nThe value of the rest should not be understated. During the NRL era the best three coaches \u2013 Bennett, Bellamy and Robinson \u2013 are 15-3 in preliminary finals after getting the week off. Bennett is a perfect 4-0. When the elite coaches have the better team and time to prepare, they typically win.\nBennett is on the doorstep of history. He is also on the doorstep of the end. He may coach elsewhere again but for the first time in his career, his presence in the game is uncertain.",

The Victorian National told Guardian Australia he supported the commitment by the National Farmers Federation to an economy-wide target of net carbon zero by 2050.\nHe characterised the NFF\u2019s position as \u201ceminently sensible\u201d.\n\u201cFor us to succeed as a party in the future, we need a credible policy on emissions reduction and broader environmental issues to engage with younger voters,\u201d Chester told Guardian Australia.\nHe added it would be \u201cmadness for regional communities and the agricultural sector to rule itself out of a [net zero] conversation prematurely when there could be opportunities for increasing sustainability by being part of the solution\u201d.\nWith business groups leading calls for the government to adopt a net zero target, Guardian Australia understands Frydenberg will address the coming transition through an economic lens at a session convened by the Ai Group.\nThe interventions come as the Morrison government mulls its position ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. The former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack warned this week that a flat \u201cno\u201d to net zero could threaten Australia\u2019s trade relationships and export income.\nAfter Joyce returned to the Nationals leadership, he signalled initially that his party would be unlikely to sign on to a net zero commitment ahead of Glasgow.\nBut the deputy prime minister subsequently softened his position after several colleagues told him that decision was one for the Nationals party room \u2013 not a captain\u2019s call. Some of Joyce\u2019s strongest internal supporters oppose a net zero commitment.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also faced questions from the US president, Joe Biden, about Australia\u2019s climate policy during their first bilateral meeting in New York.\nBiden had used a speech to the UN general assembly earlier on Tuesday to urge \u201cevery nation\u201d to \u201cbring their highest-possible ambitions to the table when we meet in Glasgow\u201d for the climate summit in November and to \u201ckeep raising our collective ambition over time\u201d.\nMorrison, who insists Australia and the US are on the same page about climate policy, also met the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, in Washington after his conversation with Biden. Johnson is in the US to lobby other leaders to increase ambition ahead of the Glasgow summit.\nThe Australian government is expected to announce its climate strategy next month.

Metropolitan Liberal MPs are also agitating for increased ambition in the medium term, with the Wentworth MP, Dave Sharma, proposing a 2035 target of 40-45%.\nBut the current expectation is the government will try to deflect that pressure by highlighting a projected overachievement on the current commitment of a 26 to 28% cut on 2005 levels by 2030.\nAustralia\u2019s trade minister, Dan Tehan, told the National Press Club on Wednesday the government was still thrashing out its plan \u201cto get as close to net zero by 2050 as we possibly can\u201d.\nTehan said he thought Australia would \u201cplay an absolutely key role as we head towards trying to get to that 2050 zero emissions target and trying to help the rest of the world and key countries in our region reach those goals as well\u201d.\nTehan was non-committal when asked about McCormack\u2019s views, and the push by metropolitan Liberals including Sharma for Australia to pledge stronger interim targets. Tehan\u2019s electorate is in regional Victoria.\n\u201cWell, obviously Australia has a very clear position at the moment and that is that we\u2019re aiming to get as close to net zero by 2050 as we possibly can and we continue to work through that,\u201d the trade minister said, before stressing the government\u2019s emphasis on low-emissions technologies such as hydrogen.\n\u201cOne of the things that as trade minister that I am ultimately seeking to do is to make sure we can put in place the partnerships with other countries, to not only make sure that we can get as near as possible to meeting our commitments, but that they can as well.\u201d",

Some also reported fainting, seizures, hospitalisation, and fatalities. More than half of those surveyed said they had never been warned about the risks relating to heat stress.\nThe experience of heat stress greatly depended on the conditions of employment, the researchers found, with workers in casual, labour hire, on-demand and temporary migrant working arrangements most at risk.\nWorkers using PPE reported experienced higher than usual levels of heat, fatigue, sweating, skin rashes, and difficulty breathing. They described a full shift in PPE as \u201cdebilitating\u201d and \u201cstifling\u201d, which was compounded by higher workloads of increasing intensity, especially for cleaners and healthcare personnel.\nCleaners working in education, health and other settings described significantly increased workloads, such as sanitising outdoor play equipment, that often needed to be done at the hottest part of the day.\nMeatworks cleaners described the use of heavy PPE including plastic aprons, face masks, eye protection and gloves as particularly stressful, saying it caused dehydration, headaches and fatigue, and made the use of machinery more dangerous as a consequence.\nThe problems were compounded when workers could not access air-conditioned spaces, such as health workers or in-home care workers, or workers in older or poorly maintained vehicles.\nJohn Newton, a manufacturing worker from Queensland told Guardian Australia: \u201cUnless people have experienced the discomfort, and having to do that for long shifts, I don\u2019t think people get a good gauge of what it\u2019s like \u2013 especially if you\u2019re able to work in an air conditioned area and know you can escape the heat through the peak of the day. I don\u2019t think a lot of people really understand it can affect life outside work as well.\u201d\nDue to working with hazardous materials, Newton\u2019s role required wearing of a certain amount of PPE prior to the pandemic, but since its onset masks have also been required on site \u2013 an area that has little ventilation due to large machinery and no air conditioning.\n\u201cOne of my personal worst experiences was wearing full plastic overalls and working in those for a period of six hours throughout the day. By the end of the day I\u2019d lost 8kg in sweat,\u201d Newton said.\nThe report calls on state and federal governments to overhaul health and safety frameworks and to involve workers and their representatives in the creation and enforcement of protections against heat stress, along with risks from climate crisis, such as bushfire smoke.\nGodfrey Moase from the United Workers\u2019 Union said the union would heed the recommendations of the report, which they believed would empower workers to protect the health and safety of themselves and their colleagues.\n\u201cThe report highlights how important it is in terms of managing Covid and safety to take into account workers\u2019 lived experience on the job and start on that basis to build effective safety responses,\u201d Moase said.\n\u201cOn current policy settings when you add in climate crisis and Covid-19, those crises will exacerbate inequality. People will have very different working experiences in the heat, based on how privileged or underprivileged they are in the system.\u201d\nOllie Jay, professor of heat and health at Sydney University,said the report addressed an important challenge for the future.\n\u201cClearly extreme heat is a problem and that\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d Jay said.\nThe risks were particularly high for workers in lower socio-economic groups, and those performing menial or piecework, where their wages were tied to their output, Jay said.\n\u201cWhat we know is one of the ways we naturally defend against heat stress during physical work is that we slow down. If you do that and your productivity is dependent on how much activity you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll end up producing less and getting paid less, or work longer to make the same pay. We know that it\u2019s getting worse now as the weather becomes hotter, and that\u2019s really going to impact those people disproportionately,\u201d Jay said.\nIt was not a surprise that the primary challenge since Covid is the wearing of extra PPE. \u201cPPE by design stops water droplets, so that works in both directions. How we keep cool is the evaporation of sweat, but PPE has a high evaporation resistance. It stops sweat evaporating through it, so you can sweat a lot but it doesn\u2019t cool you down as it should.\u201d\nJay warned that strategies for mitigating heat stress in the workplace needed to be evidence-based and sustainable. \u201cYou might be doing something that feels like it\u2019s making you cooler but that might not be reducing your heat stress risk. It\u2019s important to have policies in place to manage heat stress in the workplace, but it\u2019s really important to have the right policies in place.\u201d",

        "content": "The gas crisis is global and HM Treasury can hardly send an invoice to Gazprom or Qatar\nHere\u2019s a development in the energy crisis we didn\u2019t expect from a free-market business secretary: talk of a windfall tax on companies that are making big profits from the surge in gas prices.\nSpain has taken a step down that route and Kwasi Kwarteng told a select committee on Wednesday that the UK government is considering a similar scheme. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing in Spain is recognising it\u2019s an entire system. I\u2019m in discussion with Ofgem [the energy regulator] and other officials\u201d.\nOne might say Kwarteng\u2019s sense for political risk is strong. Come next spring, when the big energy companies report financial figures for 2021, those with power-generation and trading divisions, or big gas-producing fields, are likely to see bumper returns. There will be some big winners. The contrast with the likely rise in consumers\u2019 bills when the price cap is next reviewed will be stark.\nBut windfall taxes are difficult. Well-designed schemes tend to be narrowly focused and have a clear purpose. Gordon Brown got a tick in both boxes with his windfall tax on privatised utilities when New Labour came to power in 1997. He justified the levy on the grounds that the companies had been privatised too cheaply (absolutely correct) and said the money would be spent on schools and a \u201cwelfare to work\u201d programme. The corporate fuss quickly died down. The hit was clean.\nA windfall tax in current circumstances would be far messier. The gas crisis is global and HM Treasury can hardly send an invoice to Gazprom or Qatar. So who would get whacked?\nConsider Centrica, owner of British Gas. On one hand, the company may soon be expected to provide a funeral service for under-capitalised independent retail suppliers that go bust; that\u2019s useful for government. On the other hand, Centrica will be making good money from its upstream gas assets, its 20% stake in nuclear power generator British Energy and its trading business. Should a windfall tax apply to those operations? The company, one suspects, would argue that it is able to be a port in a storm in the retail market because it is broadly spread.\nLook elsewhere in the UK energy market and, unlike Spain, the industry is fragmented. Kwarteng can talk about \u201can entire system\u201d, but the set-up is blurry at the edges and sources supplies globally. BP and Shell, for example, might reasonably grumble that a tax on their trading arms \u2013 but not their international rivals\u2019 \u2013 would be a tax on being British. Many power generators already sell under contracts-for-difference that limit their upside, so how would excess profits be defined? And, since it\u2019s impossible to say when \u201cnormal\u201d conditions will return, over what period?\nNone of which says a windfall tax can\u2019t be designed, but Kwarteng raised more questions than answers with his line about getting \u201cthe energy system as a whole to help itself\u201d. Does that mean the windfall receipts would be redirected to the struggling retail supply companies? How would that tally with the promise that no operator will get a bailout?\nOr perhaps the aim is to shield consumers from looming price rises by suspending the normal cap-setting mechanism. If so, one might as well give up on the cap altogether, a course Kwarteng said he definitely won\u2019t take. Or maybe the big idea is something else entirely.\nKwarteng\u2019s vagueness, one suspects, mostly advertises ministers\u2019 paranoia that the energy crisis will spill into a cost of living crisis. On that score, at least, they are right to worry. If a windfall tax is supposed to be more than posturing, however, you have to show some grasp of the design.\nThe possible bid for Entain, the Ladbrokes and Coral owner, has been improved already. DraftKings is now at \u00a328 a share, having had \u00a325 rejected. And the share element of the offer (most of it) would be calculated only after the two sides have made their \u201cfirst agreed public statement\u201d, which hasn\u2019t happened yet.\nTherein lies a problem, though. While DraftKings\u2019 management is clearly mustard keen, are its shareholders? The US group\u2019s share price has fallen from $58 (\u00a342) at the start of this week to roughly $53 in early trading on Wednesday. A slip of some size is par for the course, but there comes a point when a deal simply becomes unaffordable.\nAs things stand now, DraftKings is a business valued at $22bn contemplating buying one worth almost as much. Even in the red-hot world of US gambling, that is not straightforward.",

        "content": "The couple, both of whom passed away in recent years, did a brilliant job on Whistling Straits and more than a hundred other courses during a storied six-decade career\nWhen the dust settles following the 43rd staging of the Ryder Cup at the Straits Course on Sunday evening, there is a reasonable chance the star of the week could be the beloved course architect, Pete Dye \u2013 for the simple reason that, whenever something major is played on a Dye course, the course always finds a way to stand out.\nDye, who died last year aged 92, was a titanic figure in the realm of golf architecture \u2013 one of only four course architects to be enshrined in the World Golf Hall of Fame \u2013 having designed more than a hundred courses around the world across a panoramic six-decade career. His tracks have held six major championships, most recently at the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island earlier this year. The key to understanding a Dye course is that he makes them look much harder than they actually play.\nAt Whistling Straits, for example, most of the sand from the countless bunkers \u2013 there are rumoured to be more than a thousand \u2013 are out of play and do not affect anything other than the players\u2019 eyes. The deft use of optical illusion through blind tee shots, deceptively wide fairways and shrewd angles has been hailed as genius and decried as maddening, often in the same round. But as Dye famously put it: \u201cGolf is not a fair game, so why build a course fair?\u201d\nA one-time life insurance salesman who played in six US Amateurs and the 1957 US Open (where he matched Arnold Palmer\u2019s score and bettered that of Jack Nicklaus), Dye turned to course design in his mid-thirties and he was only half of the operation. His wife, Alice, was a two-time US women\u2019s senior amateur champion and a top-flight course designer herself. She saw herself as Pete\u2019s editor and he always gave her credit.\nIt was Alice who spotted the crater surrounding the 17th at Sawgrass and suggested turning the peninsula into an island, and she who came up with the idea of raising the fairways of the Ocean Course so one could actually see the Atlantic. She also suggested moving the long par-three 17th at Whistling Straits right to the edge of Lake Michigan \u2013 a knee-knocker that will almost surely factor into the outcome this weekend. These features create what they call the fear factor. Players think about them before they go to bed the night before.\n\u201cI typically really enjoy Pete Dye golf courses,\u201d Jon Rahm said in May at the US PGA Championship. \u201cYou get to the tee, you expect a fairway that you\u2019re not really going to see, deceiving off the tee, very deceiving to the eye on every single shot. You have a shape off the tee and another shape coming into the green. It\u2019s a true ball-striker\u2019s golf course.\u201d\nMany of the flourishes that became Dye\u2019s signatures \u2013 pot bunkers, fairway swales, railroad ties edging water hazards, small target greens \u2013 were inspired by the couple\u2019s visit to Scotland in 1963. After Pete played in the British Amateur at St Andrews, he remained in the country and conducted a thorough study of its classic courses. The Straits Course itself was built as a tribute to the great links courses of Scotland and Ireland, even if it does not play that way at all.\n\u201cHe was a guy who really made you uncomfortable the whole round,\u201d said Brandt Snedeker, who won at the Harbourtown Golf Links in Hilton Head, one of Dye\u2019s first courses back in the 1960s. \u201cAnd he did it visually. He\u2019d always make you think.\u201d Pete was called a master of deception, a visual intimidator, the Marquis de Sod \u2013 but they were both diabolical. Or was it Dye-abolical?\nAlice was the first woman member and first president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects and she revolutionised design for the women\u2019s game by taking their games into consideration rather than treating them as afterthoughts, which she did with the placement and play angles of tee boxes for women. Together they developed a refined architectural style that presented unique challenges to professionals and average players alike.\n\u201cWhile Pete designed to torment the most accomplished professional, his forward tees allowed the most inexperienced to play,\u201d said Herb Kohler, the toilet tycoon and Whistling Straits owner who brought Dye to Wisconsin to construct the course that will host this year\u2019s Ryder Cup on the dead flat of an abandoned airfield in the mid-1990s. \u201cHe would challenge the professional both physically and mentally, while remarkably accommodating the raw amateur who was learning the game.\u201d\nThe Dyes might be gone \u2013 Alice passed away one year before Pete \u2013 but they will no doubt be a big part of the conversation as the Straits Course takes centre stage once again.\u201cAt the end of the round golfers may call Pete Dye a few unmentionable names,\u201d he wrote near the end of his life, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t keep me from thinking of new ways to try to challenge and thrill golfers on every hole.\u201d",

Uefa, having already mooted a boycott, has now spelt out its objections and called for new engagement from Fifa.\nUefa said it had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Fifa\u2019s approach to the plans, which \u201chas so far led to radical reform projects being communicated and openly promoted before having been given, together with other stakeholders, the chance to participate in any consultation meeting\u201d.\nThe European governing body said it had written to Fifa on 14 September, calling for consultation, but had not received a reply. This contradicts a claim by Fifa that all stakeholders in football, including confederations, had been approached for discussions at the beginning of the month.\nAs well as asking that Fifa considers nine different criteria before making any judgment as to the feasibility of a biennial World Cup, Uefa spelt out what it saw as the key risks.\nThe four issues, described as \u201creal dangers\u201d, firstly included a potential loss in prestige from making the World Cup more frequent, with the competition\u2019s current schedule giving it \u201ca mystique that generations of fans have grown up with\u201d.\nUefa also argues that, despite Fifa\u2019s promises of fewer matches for players, the games that remain will be more demanding, forcing players to \u201cengage in summer high-intensity competitions every year instead of longer recuperation breaks in alternate years\u201d.\nUefa also rejects the argument, led by Fifa\u2019s head of global development Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, that the new schedule would improve the competitive chances of smaller nations, claiming instead that many will be stymied by a lack of \u201cregular matches\u201d if they fail to qualify for the tournaments. Finally Uefa cites a risk to the development of women\u2019s football, with tournaments \u201cdeprived of exclusive slots and overshadowed by the proximity of top men\u2019s events\u201d.\nThat plans for a biennial World Cup do not take into consideration the needs of the women\u2019s game were confirmed to the media last week, another bone of contention for Uefa whose public letter on Wednesday was headlined: \u201cProper consultation, rather than media announcements needed\u201d.\nThe decision by Fifa to brief the media and unleash a phalanx of player \u201clegends\u201d to support the proposals is a complaint shared by the Premier League, with every one of the competition\u2019s 20 clubs expressing opposition to the reforms at a shareholders\u2019 meeting in London on Wednesday.~\nAt the Premier League meeting clubs also discussed dates when the league will be suspended next year to accommodate the Qatar World Cup, with play expected to stop after the weekend of 12 November 2022 and resume on Boxing Day.\nThey have put in place plans to scale up Covid checks, including the possibility of requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test result from every matchgoer, should the pandemic situation worsen over the coming months.\nSources said the Premier League is determined not to go back to a situation where crowds are limited or banned altogether from top-flight matches.",

A story of sisters and midlife reckonings, it puts two older women centre stage and comes with a seismic sibling betrayal. The Lodger is also the story of good and bad mothers, how the young relate to the old, and how the old nurture the young. Directed by Geraldine Alexander, it takes wildly unexpected turns and is stuffed full of wise statements about life, love and death. It does not feel like a single play and herein lies the problem: too many stories and ideas jostle for focus.\nIt begins with a bristling reunion as Dolly (Sylvestra Le Touzel) arrives in London from Harrogate to visit her sister Esther (Penny Downie), a successful novelist, following their mother\u2019s death. There are revelations, fights and forgiveness, alongside a parallel storyline of Esther\u2019s young lodger, Jude (Matthew Tennyson), who has suffered maternal abuse and for whom Esther is a substitute mother of sorts. A subplot about Jude\u2019s once-famous musician grandfather takes us away to Norway where a love story develops between Jude and Anila (Iniki Mariano), a maths student he meets on a park bench, and who turns out to be his cousin. This romance, unconvincing in both its beginning and its ending, seems like a distraction from the greater intrigue around the sisters and Jude\u2019s relationship with Esther \u2013 their affection remains vague and underexplored.\nLe Touzel excels as Dolly, the more opinionated and unfulfilled sister who has just left her unfaithful husband of 46 years, and whose internal midlife audit includes sadness over her childlessness. Esther is the more opaque and complicated sister and Downie appears less certain in the role. Tennyson is sparky in parts but seems like an impassive onlooker for the first part of the play. Another tangential plotline turns him into a successful playwright and this, too, feels unconvincing.\nCharacters proclaim they are \u201cvulnerable\u201d or \u201cconflicted\u201d rather than showing us so, and there are sudden shifts from anger or trauma to everyday observation and whimsy that sound discordant in their delivery. They talk in statements rather than truly talking to each other.\nRichard Kent\u2019s set design is sleek and serene, conjuring the effect of inside and out, dry land and beachy shingle, both at once. Its lingering beauty mirrors a script that is just as lyrical in parts but also frustratingly ungainly.\nAt the Coronet theatre, London, until 9 October.",

The extension of diversion from prosecution for crimes associated with problem drug use takes us closer to having a criminal justice system that can deal more effectively with supporting people away from criminal activity.\u201d\nThe announcement prompted an immediate backlash from the Scottish Conservatives who described it as \u201cde-facto decriminalisation by the back door\u201d of drugs such as heroin, crystal meth and crack cocaine.\nOther parties welcomed the shift. Maggie Chapman, justice spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, who entered a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish government last month, said: \u201cGiven Scotland\u2019s worryingly high drug death rate, it\u2019s important we move to a harm reduction approach, and this move is an important step given the limited powers Scotland has to address it. It is especially needed in places like Dundee, where whole communities are devastated by the failures of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 approach.\u201d",

        "content": "An independent review of the regulation of the failed betting site Football Index \u2013 the self-styled \u201cfootball stock market\u201d \u2013 has heavily criticised the actions and attitude of both the Gambling Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) before FI\u2019s collapse in March, which left at least \u00a390m of users\u2019 stakes trapped in the platform.\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) appointed Malcolm Sheehan QC, a specialist in product liability and group actions, to review the regulation of Football Index in June. His report, published on Wednesday, reveals profound ignorance of the platform\u2019s structure and business model on the part of the Gambling Commission, and a reluctance by both regulators to take adequate responsibility for protecting the site\u2019s users.\nFootball Index operated under a licence from the Gambling Commission, which regulates sports betting products. However, its website mirrored a stock exchange, offering customers a chance to buy \u201cshares\u201d in leading footballers which returned \u201cdividends\u201d based on their performance on the pitch. As a result, it could have fallen under the remit of the FCA, which regulates investment and share-trading platforms.\nSheehan\u2019s review reveals that, while the Commission initially licensed Football Index, via its parent company BetIndex, in 2015 on the basis that its \u201cshares\u201d were bets which expired after three years, the regulator became aware that the site also had \u201cstock market functionality\u201d only in March 2018. The review also finds that \u201cfrom the time when the Commission first became aware of the full nature of the Football Index product in early 2019, a significant amount of time was taken whilst the Commission sought a greater understanding of what was undoubtedly a novel and \u2026 complex product.\u201d Sheehan concludes that \u201cnearly two years \u2026 between 2019 and the suspension of BetIndex\u2019s licence in March 2021 was too long.\u201d\nThe FCA, meanwhile, took four months to respond to a request from the Commission in May 2019 for an opinion on whether the Authority should have a regulatory role.\nThen, having suggested in September 2019 that \u201cdual-regulation\u201d by both bodies would be appropriate, the FCA changed its mind, telling the Commission that \u201cit would not regulate part of the product\u201d. While the Authority later warned BetIndex that \u201cthe whole BetIndex product was likely to fall within the FCA\u2019s remit\u201d, it \u201cdid not obtain external legal advice from leading counsel until after BetIndex\u2019s gambling licence had been suspended\u201d.\nIn the meantime the Gambling Commission ignored warnings that Football Index\u2019s business model was flawed and that customers\u2019 money could be at risk. These included a complaint by a competitor in January 2020 that the platform was \u201can exceptionally dangerous pyramid scheme under the guise of a football stock market\u201d and that urgent action was required \u201cto alert and protect users\u201d.\nSheehan\u2019s recommendations for the Commission include a need for \u201cprompter decision-making and action\u201d, the \u201cprioritisation of novel products for enhanced regulatory scrutiny\u201d and \u201ccontinuing scrutiny of divergences between described and actual features of a product\u201d. In addition to speeding up its decision-making, Sheehan sees a need for \u201cconsistent decision-making across different departments within the FCA\u201d and \u201cbetter co-operation with the Commission\u201d. His findings will also be studied closely by lawyers at the specialist group-action firm Leigh Day, which is investigating possible claims for compensation on behalf of a number of former Football Index customers who lost significant sums when the platform collapsed.\nResponding to the review, Andrew Rhodes, the Gambling Commission\u2019s chief executive, said the regulator had \u201calready acted on a number of recommendations in the report\u201d, adding that its \u201cactions were always focused on trying to protect consumers while we sought to bring the operator into compliance with regulations.\u201d",

But just as it seemed he and Dawson had put Hampshire in an overwhelmingly dominant position, and with less than four overs left, Parkinson lodged a ball into Vince\u2019s back pad.\nAs Vince shook it free, Parkinson began a sustained plea that turned into a sprint of triumph. Vince was out lbw. Brad Wheal came out as a nightwatchman and, in the very next over, Dawson was bowled by Tom Bailey for 41, a magnificent ball that nipped back, to give Bailey his first five-fer of the season and swing the game back on to a more even keel.\nWith Nottinghamshire out of the running after failing to pick up a third batting point at Trent Bridge, the Championship is heading to either Edgbaston, Old Trafford or the Rose Bowl. If Warwickshire beat Somerset, and collect all their possible bowling points, they will win the title. If they draw, it will be one of these two teams battling it out here, where runs have been harvested under duress.\nLancashire had started the morning in the unpromising position of 25 for three, the ominous figures of Mohammad Abbas and Keith Barker waiting, ball in hand, at the River and Pavilion ends, clouds gathering. When Josh Bohannon, superbly caught at second slip, and nightwatchman Jack Blatherwick, who equalled his highest score of four, were both out with only two runs added, Hampshire\u2019s first-innings 143 looked some distance away.\nBut Steven Croft, Luke Wood and Bailey found a way through, bashing even the odd loose ball from Abbas, \u2013 Wood hitting a six which left the ice-cream seller peering suspiciously out of his van \u2013 to take Lancashire to within two runs of Hampshire\u2019s total.\nBarker finished with four for 51 for his efforts, Abbas five for 48, kissing the Aigburth turf on his way back towards the beautiful old pavilion. When Bailey sliced through Hampshire\u2019s top order, his coathanger shoulders charging into the wind, and Nick Gubbins played an immaculate forward defensive shot to George Balderson \u2013 but seconds too late, reducing them to 24 for four \u2013 it seemed Lancashire could scoop up the game in the second day. But for one man: James Vince.",

On Monday, the Department of Conservation reported that one unlucky godwit, who was being tracked, was forced to take a huge u-turn over the Pacific ocean and finished up back at his Alaskan take-off point after 57 hours of constant flight.\nThe adult male bird, known as 4BRWB because of the bands on his legs, took off from tidal flats in Alaska\u2019s Yukon-Kuskokwim delta on 11 September before encountering strong winds 2,000km into his journey and turning back after 33 hours of outward bound flight.\nOther godwits who left the Yukon at the same time as 4BRWB made it to New Zealand, but it is feasible others also turned back, ornithologist at Massey University Phil Battley said.\nThe bird\u2019s u-turn mid-migration was unusual: \u201cOver the years we\u2019ve tracked about 70 godwits leaving Alaska, and this is the first we know has had to turn back because of bad winds,\u201d he said.\nIn New Zealand some 80,000 godwits arrive and move into harbours and estuaries across the two islands.

Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, accused Apple of running its App Store as a monopoly, exercising too much power over what apps are allowed and how they are run.\nA US judge\u2019s ruling in September struck down a core part of Apple\u2019s App Store rules that prohibit developers from telling users about other places they can go to pay the developer directly, rather than using Apple\u2019s payment mechanisms.\nWhile the ruling was considered a partial victory for Epic, the judge stopped short of granting Epic some of its other wishes, such as forcing Apple to open the iPhone up to third-party app stores.\nThe judge ruled Epic failed to demonstrate Apple is an illegal monopolist, but did show the smartphone giant engaged in \u201canticompetitive conduct\u201d under California laws.\nEpic made clear at the time that it does not consider the decision a win, and that it plans to appeal.\nApple confirmed the authenticity of the letter that Sweeney shared, but declined to comment further. Apple has not yet said whether it will ask for the injunction to be paused pending the appeal process.\n\u201cEpic committed an intentional breach of contract, and breach of trust, by concealing code from Apple and making related misrepresentations and omissions,\u201d the iPhone maker told Epic Games, according to the letter shared by Sweeney.\nDevelopers have long criticized Apple\u2019s commissions of between 15% and 30% on many App Store purchases, what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.",

Morrison is understood to have reassured the UK prime minister at their dinner in Washington that he had carried the message to Paris as promised.\nAsked whether he understood why the French were annoyed, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things \u2013 there are no easy ways of having these conversations \u2013 it\u2019s a very human thing to delay until the last possible moment.\u201d\nSome Downing Street officials believe the French government has kept the public spat running so vocally in an attempt to ensure they receive the maximum compensation for the cancellation of the submarine contract.\nJohnson\u2019s latest comments came as Biden moved to soothe French fury. After a phone conversation between him and Emmanuel Macron, France announced that it would return its ambassador to the US and Biden vowed not to cut Paris out of key future defence decisions in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn a joint statement issued after a phone call ended a five-day standoff between the leaders, the two men agreed to meet in Europe in late October, probably at the G20 summit, to discuss how to improve consultations in future.\nMacron said he would despatch his withdrawn ambassador to Washington next week, but there was no sign that the US or Australia were going to go back on their decision to work together on building nuclear powered submarines, a decision that led Canberra to cancel its A$90bn contract for the French to build diesel-based submarines.\nBiden instead said the US would be supplying extra help to the French-led anti-terrorist operations in the Sahel.\nThe joint statement also sought to remove any suggestion that the Americans regarded the independently minded French as unreliable partners in the efforts to constrain China in the Indo-Pacific, the chief unstated purpose of the Aukus pact.\nParis reacted with fury after the announcement of the three-way pact. When withdrawing their US and Australian ambassadors, France dismissed the UK\u2019s role as that of a \u201cfifth wheel\u201d, and claiming it shows Downing Street is in \u201cvassalage\u201d to Washington.\nAsked about the backlash on Wednesday after discussing the pact with Biden and Morrison, Johnson said: \u201cI just think it\u2019s time for some of our dearest friends around the world to prenez un grip about this and donnez-moi un break.\n\u201cBecause this is fundamentally a great step forward for global security. It\u2019s three very like-minded allies standing shoulder to shoulder creating a new partnership for the sharing of technology. It\u2019s not exclusive. It\u2019s not trying to shoulder anybody out. It\u2019s not adversarial towards China for instance.\u201d\nJohnson has been forced to acknowledge during his US visit that a bilateral trade deal with Washington appears a distant prospect, with Biden\u2019s priorities lying with his domestic agenda, including passing the Build Back Better bill.\nGovernment sources have suggested the UK could bid to join the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal instead. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will travel to Mexico on Wednesday, and the Mexican government signalled on Tuesday it did not reject the idea outright.\nJohnson\u2019s official spokesperson has insisted striking a bilateral trade deal with the US \u2013 something the PM had previously suggested would be straightforward \u2013 remained the UK\u2019s priority.",

        "content": "Pamphlet for the Fabian Society emphasises values of work, society and partnership with private sector\nKeir Starmer has set Labour on a decisive course toward the centre ground in a 35-page statement of intent that emphasises the values of hard work, contributing to society and partnership with the private sector.\nLabour leftwingers are likely to see the 14,000 word document \u2013 entitled The Road Ahead \u2013 as marking a shift away from the Corbyn era\u2019s radical spending promises, such as the large-scale nationalisations of the railways, water, Royal Mail and broadband providers.\nIn Starmer\u2019s essay, that focus has been swept away and replaced by a declaration that, \u201cthe role of government is to be a partner to private enterprise, not stifle it.\u201d\nA Labour government would allow the public to \u201ctake back control\u201d of their lives, Starmer wrote, making good on the promises made by Brexiters five years ago and building a \u201ccontribution society,\u201d that rewards hard work.\nIn the pamphlet for the Fabian Society, designed to defy critics who have bemoaned his lack of ideology, Starmer pledges to \u201crepair the public finances\u201d.\nPublic sector reform is also earmarked as a priority, with a promise to use technology to help transform the provision of healthcare and bring down waiting lists.\nHowever, Starmer also says a Labour government would draw on the spirit of togetherness sparked by the Covid pandemic to build a society in which families and communities are put before individuals.\nA Labour source said that they believed the public were now willing to give Starmer a hearing, after spending his first year rebuilding trust in the party \u2013 but said the vision he set out had to be credible and responsible.\n\u201cPeople believe Keir could be prime minister. It\u2019s the first time people have believed that about a Labour leader in a decade. Now it\u2019s about showing them why he should be prime minister,\u201d the source said.\nThe pamphlet includes a blunt message to his party, which he says has risked wallowing in \u201csepia-tinged nostalgia\u201d in recent years, and become, \u201ca party squabbling over its own past, rather than one focused on the future of the country\u201d.\nIt comes amid a shock attempt by Starmer to re-write Labour leadership rules which has enraged the party\u2019s left, with sources suggesting he will press ahead with plans even though they risk a humiliating defeat at conference without the support of key unions.\nOn Wednesday, union leaders attempted to put the brakes on the plans to return to the old electoral college system, urging Starmer to postpone plans for a vote at party conference \u2013 and hinting they would oppose them if he pressed ahead.\nStarmer said he would consider union leaders\u2019 call for a delay \u2013 but any retreat is likely to be viewed as an embarrassment before a party conference which has been billed as a make-or-break moment for his leadership.\nDuring his first 18 months, the Labour leader has been beset with consistent complaints from within his own party that he has failed to make clear to the public what he stands for \u2013 a charge his team reject, pointing to the difficulty of gaining a hearing during a public health emergency.\nIn the essay, set to provide the backbone for his first party conference speech in front of a live audience, Starmer says a Labour government would hand back powers from Whitehall to local communities, tackle inequality, and ensure effort is rewarded with better jobs and opportunities.\n\u201cThe desire of people across the country to have real power and control \u2013 expressed most forcibly in the Brexit vote \u2013 remains unmet,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next Labour government must deliver sustainable growth, repair the public finances and give people the means to take back control.\u201d\nThe Labour leader, who was at the forefront of efforts to persuade his party to back a second Brexit referendum, has largely avoided the topic of Brexit since becoming Labour leader, but in his essay he says his government would \u201cfix the holes in the shoddy Brexit deal,\u201d that have left businesses facing bureaucracy and red tape.\nStarmer called for a \u201cnew settlement,\u201d between businesses, government and the public that involves, \u201ccompletely rethinking where power lies in our country \u2013 driving it out of the sclerotic and wasteful parts of a centralised system and into the hands of people and communities across the land\u201d.\nThe pamphlet includes few concrete policies, but is peppered with hints of the party\u2019s direction.\nStarmer describes it as a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d that class sizes have been allowed to reach their highest level in 20 years, for example. Tony Blair\u2019s pledge card for the 1997 general election included a promise to cap class sizes at 30.\nHighlighting the challenges facing children from low-income backgrounds, he says Labour would help provide the \u201csoft skills\u201d that allow private school pupils to emerge with \u201cenviable self-confidence, self-worth and belief,\u201d\nThat would mean ensuring that by the age of ten they have the opportunity to \u201cplay an instrument, join a competitive sports team, visit the seaside, the countryside, or the city, go to cultural institutions, ride a bike and learn how to debate their ideas.\u201d\n\u201cFrom my days at university, through my legal career and as a politician, I\u2019ve seen supremely talented, hard-working people from ordinary backgrounds held back, not just by material circumstances but by self-doubt or a sense they don\u2019t quite \u2018belong,\u2019\u201d he says.\nAs well as setting out his vision for the next Labour government, Starmer\u2019s essay includes an extended attack on what he calls the \u201clost decade\u201d of the 2010s, with successive Tory governments slashing public services, and then hiding their lack of an economic policy behind the promise of Brexit.\nHe also takes aim at the Conservatives for their \u201cdivisive\u201d attempt to promulgate a culture war.\n\u201cThe Conservatives have tried to exploit divisions, leading to an increasingly bizarre obsession with what happens on university campuses, a crime bill that offers statues of slavers more protection than women walking down the street, and McCarthyite accusations of Marxist plots against everyone from teachers to those protesting racism,\u201d he says, pointing to the \u201ctawdry\u201d refusal of ministers to back Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team in taking the knee.\nAides say he worked on it \u2013 and on his crucial party conference speech \u2013 striding the beaches of Devon on a family summer holiday.",

We\u2019ve already seen hundreds of thousands of customers affected. It may go well above that,\u201d he said.\nEmma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, added that the crisis had exposed the vulnerability of the country\u2019s retail energy sector, meaning even \u201cgood, well-run companies will fail\u201d.\nKwarteng told MPs on Wednesday that the government was considering the Spanish government\u2019s plan for a \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.58bn) windfall tax on generators and energy traders that stand to gain from the energy crisis while homes and energy suppliers struggle.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at all options. I think what they\u2019re doing in Spain is recognising that it\u2019s an entire system. We\u2019re in discussion with [energy regulator] Ofgem officials, looking at all options,\u201d Kwarteng told the business select committee.\nAvro Energy, based in Hinckley in Leicestershire, became the largest supplier to go bust after leaving 580,000 households stranded, while Newcastle-based Green left behind more than 250,000 customers.\nGreen collapsed just days after admitting it would struggle to survive the winter if the government refused to provide any support to smaller energy suppliers.\nGreen\u2019s chief executive, Peter McGirr, told the Guardian there would be a \u201ctsunami of more [collapses] to come\u201d because small suppliers do not have deep enough pockets to weather the surge in costs without passing them on to their customers.\nThe government is considering paying larger energy suppliers to shoulder the cost of picking up stranded customers, but has said it is unwilling to pay to prop up failing energy companies.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is to give taxpayer money to companies which have come into the market only to exit the market after a year. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsible,\u201d Kwarteng said.\nIn total almost 2m households have lost their supplier this year, and this number is expected to spiral in the months ahead. The number of suppliers in the market is predicted by industry insiders to shrink from 70 at the beginning of the year to about 10 by the end of winter.\nSurging energy market prices have already brought steelworks and fertiliser companies to a standstill, and threatened to derail the supply chain for carbon dioxide which is critical to the UK\u2019s food, drink and meat industries.\nAfter days of increasingly desperate warnings from retailers, abattoir owners, beer and fizzy drink makers, ministers were forced to subsidise a US chemicals giant to restart its fertiliser factory on Teesside \u2013 to ensure vital supplies of carbon dioxide begin flowing again.\nThat rescue deal will cost taxpayers millions of pounds, environment secretary George Eustice admitted, and is likely to force up prices for shoppers. However, that deal only lasts for three weeks, and ministers have been unable to put a total price on the cost of propping up the factory.\nRegarding the deal, Johnson, who refused to say if government support could continue after the three-week period, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a once in a century pandemic and we\u2019ve had to cope with it in all sorts of extraordinary ways. This is just another part of it.\nCF Fertilisers supplies food-grade CO2 as a byproduct of fertiliser manufacturing, with the gas vital for food and packaging firms. Eustice said: \u201cThe reason why it is justified for the government is \u2026 if we didn\u2019t, there would be a risk to the food supply chain. It\u2019s not a risk the government is willing to take.\u201d\nRichard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said the deal was a \u201cgreat relief\u201d for the industry as it was only days away from running out of CCO2, which is used in the slaughter of birds, but added the higher cost of the making the gas will \u201cultimately feed through to food prices\u201d.\nKwarteng said: \u201cI\u2019m confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem.\u201d\nSurging power prices and CO2 shortages have heaped pressure on supply chains already creaking under staffing shortages, leaving retailers demanding urgent action from ministers to help them plug gaps in their workforces.\nThe shortage of HGV drivers, which is estimated to total about 100,000, has left gaps on shelves and forced grocers to offer generous pay deals to attract hauliers.\nHowever, pleas from the food and drink industry for a short-term visa scheme to recruit overseas workers, including HGV drivers, to ease disruption in the food supply chain, has been rebuffed by Kwarteng, who told them to hire and retrain British workers instead.\nBritain\u2019s biggest supermarket warned the sector could be hit by panic buying in the run up to Christmas unless urgent action is taken to fix the shortage of HGV drivers.\nTesco\u2019s distribution director Andrew Woolfenden told ITV: \u201cOur concern is that the pictures of empty shelves will get ten times worse by Christmas and then we\u2019ll get panic-buying.\u201d",

Though the public has been forbidden from the stairs since 1987, numerous people continued to use them, despite no trespassing signs and fines of up to $1,000.\n\u201cDue to rampant illegal trespassing, Haiku Stairs is a significant liability and expense for the city, and impacts the quality of life for nearby residents,\u201d councilmember Esther Kia\u02bb\u0101ina told Hawaii News Now.\nThe hike, with its stunning views of K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay and verdant landscape, has for decades drawn tourists and, in more recent years, social media influencers.\nThe city council voted unanimously to permanently remove the staircase, citing nearly $1m in taxpayer funds already spent to remodel the stairs, as part of a project to establish a cultural and recreational park in the area, and thousands of dollars in security expenses. The mayor ordered the removal of the stairs last week.\n\u201cWe recognize the interest the stairs have to certain community groups; however, issues such as trespassing, personal injuries, invasive species and overall safety of the public cannot be ignored,\u201d said Rick Blangiardi, the city\u2019s mayor, to the Honolulu Civil Beat. \u201cFundamentally, it is inappropriate to have a high-use tourist attraction entering through this residential neighborhood, which lacks in the capacity to provide appropriate facilities or parking.\u201d\nHonolulu has budgeted $1m to remove the stairs, a project that could happen as soon as next year. The US navy built the stairs in 1942 to provide access to a radio relay station. Though trespassing is an ongoing issue, there has never been a serious injury or death due to an accident on the stairs, said Vernon Ansdell, the president of Friends of Haiku Stairs, a volunteer group that aims to preserve the trail.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the safest hiking trails in Hawaii,\u201d Ansdell wrote in the Honolulu Civil Beat. \u201cRemoval of the stairs will \u2026 result in significantly more injuries and rescues.\u201d\nThe decision to remove the stairs has sparked outrage among some in the community.\n\u201cAnyone who has climbed to the top of Haiku Stairs would never advocate tearing them down. The cable house at the summit sits close to the magnificent peak of Puukeahiakahoe,\u201d wrote Charles Pe\u2018ape\u2018a Makawalu Kekuewa Burrows in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \u201cThe astounding wonder and glory of Koolaupoko surrounds you and commands heightened awareness of your responsibility to respect and care for all that encompasses you.\u201d\nFriends of Haiku Stairs has pledged to fight the removal and says it has developed a plan to reopen the stairs with managed access that would address safety and trespassing concerns and could be operated at no cost to taxpayers.",

        "content": "Hopes that breakthrough marks new era where artificial intelligence can develop treatments for all types of cancer\nScientists have successfully used artificial intelligence to create a new drug regime for children with a deadly form of brain cancer that has not seen survival rates improve for more than half a century.\nThe breakthrough, revealed in the journal Cancer Discovery, is set to usher in an \u201cexciting\u201d new era where AI can be harnessed to invent and develop new treatments for all types of cancer, experts say.\n\u201cThe use of AI promises to have a transformative effect on drug discovery,\u201d said Prof Kristian Helin, chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), London, where a team of scientists, doctors and data analysts made the discovery.\n\u201cIn this study, use of AI has identified a drug combination which appears to have promise as a future treatment for some children with incurable brain cancer. It\u2019s exciting to think that it could become one of the first examples of a treatment proposed by AI going on to benefit patients.\u201d\nComputer scientists and cancer specialists at the ICR and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust used AI to work out that combining the drug everolimus with another called vandetanib could treat diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a rare and fast-growing type of brain tumour in children.\nCurrently, DIPG and other similar types of tumours are incredibly difficult to remove surgically from children because they are diffuse, which means they do not have well-defined borders suitable for operations.\nBut after crunching data on existing drugs, the team found everolimus could enhance vandetanib\u2019s capacity to \u201csneak\u201d through the blood-brain barrier and treat the cancer.\nThe combination has proved effective in mice and has now been tested in children. Experts now hope to test it on a much larger group of children in major clinical trials.\nThe research found that combining the two drugs extended survival in mice by 14% compared with those receiving a standard control treatment.\nBoth the drugs in the research, which was funded by Brain Research UK, the DIPG Collaborative, Children with Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, among others, are already approved to treat other types of cancer.\n\u201cDIPG is a rare and aggressive childhood brain cancer, and survival rates have not changed over the past 50 years so we desperately need to find new treatments for this disease,\u201d said Chris Jones, professor of paediatric brain tumour biology at the ICR.\n\u201cOur study demonstrates just how much AI can bring to drug discovery for cancers like DIPG, in proposing new treatment combinations that would not have been obvious to people.\n\u201cThe AI system suggested using a combination of two existing drugs to treat some children with DIPG \u2013 one to target the ACVR1 mutation, and the other to sneak the first past the blood brain barrier. The treatment extended survival when we tested it in a mouse model, and we have already started testing it out in a small number of children.\n\u201cWe still need a full-scale clinical trial to assess whether the treatment can benefit children, but we\u2019ve moved to this stage much more quickly than would ever have been possible without the help of AI.\u201d\nDr Fernando Carceller, consultant in paediatric and adolescent neuro-oncology at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and leader of the paediatric and adolescent neuro-oncology and drug development team at the ICR, said the breakthrough was \u201cencouraging\u201d and highlighted the possibilities of \u201charnessing artificial intelligence\u201d to find \u201ccures\u201d for cancer.\nThe initial idea for the research came from BenevolentAI \u2013 a company that has built an AI drug discovery platform. Researchers at the ICR worked with those from BenevolentAI to use its platform to identify drugs that could be used to treat DIPG.\nProf Peter Richardson, vice-president for pharmacology at BenevolentAI, said the early results were \u201cpromising\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAI-enhanced approaches are already proving their value in expanding researchers\u2019 capabilities to find innovative new treatment approaches \u2013 be it through uncovering new therapeutics or repurposing existing ones \u2013 not only in DIPG, but also other diseases in the future.\u201d",

But it remains unclear when the French ambassador to Australia \u2013 who was also recalled to Paris late last week in protest at the decision \u2013 will return to his post.\nMorrison said he was \u201cglad\u201d that Biden had been \u201cable to reinforce, not just from the United States\u2019 perspective, but from all partners in this new arrangement\u201d the important role for France in the Indo-Pacific.\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s been very important for the president to have that engagement,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Washington on Thursday morning Australian time.\n\u201cI look forward, when the time is right and when the opportunity presents, that we will have a similar discussion.\u201d\nBut Morrison suggested the issues between Australia and France would \u201ctake further time to work through than the ones that were being dealt with between the United States and France\u201d.\nMorrison said Australia valued its relationship with France, and wanted to work with it and Europe to preserve a stable and secure region.\n\u201cSo our door is wide open. Our invitation is there. We understand the hurt and the disappointment. And we\u2019ll be patient and we look forward to working with old friends again.\u201d\nAsked whether he would be willing to apologise to Macron when he spoke to him, Morrison stood by the decision and said he had acted in accordance with Australia\u2019s national security interests.\n\u201cHard decisions have to be made by prime ministers about our interests, and so of course that is something that was necessary for me to do.\u201d\nMorrison denied that Biden and Macron\u2019s joint statement could be seen as a repudiation of Australia\u2019s diplomacy in the lead-up to the deal\u2019s cancellation.\nMorrison said the US and France were Nato partners, a relationship that brought \u201ccertain expectations \u2026 about how they engage with each other on national security issues\u201d.\n\u201cThe issues that the US president was addressing are very different because it\u2019s a different relationship, and has different obligations.\u201d\nMorrison maintained that Australia \u201chad communicated\u201d that it believed that a conventional submarine would no longer meet its requirements.\nThe French government has said it was \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d and \u201cbetrayed\u201d, arguing the allies deliberately kept it in the dark and gave no genuine forewarning.\nOn Wednesday Morrison held talks with congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a bid to shore up support for legislation that will be needed to allow the US to share its sensitive nuclear technology with Australia.\nWelcoming Morrison to the Pentagon on Wednesday, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin emphasised that the Aukus partnership was \u201cdesigned to build on our existing alliances\u201d.\nAustin said the alignment between the US and Australia was \u201cstronger than ever\u201d, as both countries saw the region\u2019s challenges \u201cthrough a similar lens\u201d and shared \u201cthe same sense of urgency\u201d. Both sides flagged plans for more US military deployments to Australia after annual security talks in Washington last week.\nMorrison thanked the US for its support of Australian evacuation operations after the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August, saying \u201cthere is no way Australia would have been able to airlift 4,100 people out of that terrible site were it not for the sacrifice of the US defence forces\u201d.\nAt a separate media event, Morrison took aim at his political rivals in Australia, after Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, sought assurances on the implications of the new arrangement for nuclear-propelled submarines, including that Australia will maintain the freedom to \u201cact alone\u201d amid increasing technological dependence on the US.\nWhile not departing from her party\u2019s qualified support for the announcement, Wong will use a speech on Thursday to renew calls for the Coalition to set up a bipartisan process that includes Labor so the success of the multi-decade acquisition is not \u201cat the mercy of changing political winds\u201d.\n\u201cI think that Australians would be puzzled as to why there can be bipartisan support for this initiative in the United States and within days, within days, the Labor party seems to be having an each way bet,\u201d Morrison said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have each way bets on national security.\u201d\nMorrison said the three conditions for support set out by Anthony Albanese would all be met. Labor has sought commitments that Australia will not set up a domestic civil nuclear industry, nor to acquire nuclear weapons, and that it will comply with the non-proliferation treaty.\nMorrison said it was important for the initiative to have bipartisan support and \u201cthese matters will be worked through in the normal way\u201d.",

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, setting off mass anti-racism protests that called for widespread police reform.\nHowever, the only Republican who voted in favor of the House bill at the time said he did so in error, and later changed the official record to reflect his opposition.\nNow that the negotiations have collapsed, Bass called on Joe Biden and his administration to \u201cuse the full extent of their constitutionally mandated power to bring about meaningful police reform\u201d.\n\u201cOur sense of urgency remains, but this issue requires a re-engagement of the legislative process,\u201d Bass said.\n\u201cWith our counterparts unwilling to come to a compromise, we have no other option than to explore further avenues to stop police brutality in this country. I will not ask our community to wait another 200 days.\u201d\nScott had repeatedly insisted in recent months that there was still hope for a deal on the police reform bill.\nJoe Biden said he will consider \u201cpotential further executive actions\u201d to address police reform after the bipartisan team of congressional negotiators failed to reach a deal on a bill.\n\u201cThe murder of George Floyd is a stain on the soul of America,\u201d the president said in a statement addressing the collapse of the negotiations. \u201cIt spurred the nation to collectively demand justice, and we will be remembered for how we responded to the call.\u201d\n\u201cRegrettably, Senate Republicans rejected enacting modest reforms, which even the previous president had supported, while refusing to take action on key issues that many in law enforcement were willing to address,\u201d Biden said.\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s cousin Shareeduh Tate said Biden should do \u201canything\u201d he could to push the reforms through. \u201cIt\u2019s a promise that was made to the family,\u201d she said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cIt was a promise that was made to the American people.\u201d\nBiden noted he still hoped to sign police reform legislation, but he said he would soon explore additional steps to determine what executive action he may be able to take on the issue.\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will continue to work with Senator Booker, Congresswoman Bass and other members of Congress who are serious about meaningful police reform,\u201d Biden said.\nMeanwhile, the civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, who have represented the family of George Floyd, expressed \u201cextreme disappointment\u201d over the collapse of police reform talks in Congress.\n\u201cIn the last year and a half, we have witnessed hundreds of thousands of Americans urging lawmakers to bring desperately needed change to policing in this country so there can be greater accountability, transparency and ultimately trust in policing,\u201d the lawyers said in a statement.\n\u201cWe can not let this be a tragic, lost opportunity to regain trust between citizens and police.\u201d\nCrump and Romanucci urged Senate Democrats to bring the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House in March, to the floor \u201cso Americans can see who is looking out for their communities\u2019 best interests\u201d.\nJacari Harris, the executive director of the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, called the collapse of talks \u201ca devastating setback\u201d. \n \u201cWe are incredibly disappointed and dismayed that the United States Senate was unable to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act \u2026 It\u2019s a shame that the bill that bore George Floyd\u2019s name was not passed, but it does not diminish the fact that Mr Floyd truly changed the world.\u201d\nMaanvi Singh and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "For Victorians all too familiar with lockdown it has been a strange time to be a rusted-on AFL fan\nOn Easter Saturday this year, Richmond hosted Sydney at the MCG. Victoria had just recorded its 36th consecutive day with no new Covid-19 cases. It was 32 degrees \u2013 the city\u2019s last sip of summer. It was cricketing weather. The young Swans took on the Kings, and ran them ragged.\nIt was natural, sitting there in your shorts and thongs, to assume the worst was behind us. It felt like the beginning of the end for Richmond, and the return to normal life. There had not been football at the MCG for more than 500 days. In that time, we had suffered through one of the worst Australian summers ever. A billion animals had died. A \u201cpneumonia of unknown etiology\u201d had upended our lives. We had then been penned in our homes for months. We\u2019d endured a long, silent winter \u2013 hanging on, hanging on, hanging on. We had done our bit, sat it out, and seen it off.\nIn the previous few months, the sporting focus had been on international tennis players holed up in quarantine, volleying against the fridge, penning open letters, trapping rodents and struggling for sympathy. The news cycle then shifted to Christian Porter, to Brittany Higgins, to the growing tensions with China.\nA year earlier, we had cleaned out our desks, cancelled all plans, and withdrawn from the world. Now the footy was back. The sun was shining. The city had a pulse. We no longer sweated over daily Covid numbers. Within a few weeks \u2013 12 months since The Last Post had been bugled to seagulls and empty stands \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest sporting crowd since the beginning of the pandemic descended on the MCG.\nBut winter set in, and the people stayed away. Organising a ticket was particularly fraught. People were reluctant to use public transport. We\u2019d become more accustomed to watching football on television. Given the state of the coverage, you\u2019d think there would have been a 2km line at every turnstile. But it was usually easier to stay home, turn up the heater and mute the commentary.\nRichmond fans in particular were loath to head to the Docklands. When they were scuttled by the Gold Cold Suns the crowd was less than 10,000. Many stayed home and wrote around the end of an era like they would the death of a pet. Those who did turn up were drowned out by what seemed to be a bunch of kids on the grog for the first time.\nYou never had this virus licked of course. A footy team on the tarmac was often a portent of bad news. They were invariably buckling up an hour or two before the leaks started, and the lockdown was confirmed. For a few days, Victoria was a national footy hub. But then some furniture removalists lugged their sofas and spread the bastard south. It took hold at a Carlton-Geelong game, a ghastly affair played in thick fog. I left at half time, and arrived home to find Dwayne Russell calling it like the final furlong of a Melbourne Cup. A Covid-positive supporter retreated to an MCC bar - a reasonable option given the quality of entertainment - and we were up and away again. We were conditioned to it by now.\nThis time, Sydney copped it too. \u201cA code red for humanity\u201d was declared, which helped no end. The pandemic sapped our energy and wit, pitting old against young, vaccinated against unvaccinated, home office worker against business owner, \u2018lock \u2018em up\u2019 against \u2018let it rip\u2019, Melbourne against Sydney, left against right, even Astra Zeneca against Pfizer.\nFriends and colleagues who had always seemed to be travelling okay were shattered. Social media turned our brains to mush by mid-morning. We were squabbling with strangers. Everyone \u2013 from influencers in the leggings space, to anonymous apparatchiks and armchair assholes \u2013 were droning on, chiming in, and freaking out. We couldn\u2019t agree on how to adjudicate head-high tackles, let alone how to vaccinate our population. We were snitching on and shouting over one another, drawing the same battlelines as we do on every other issue.\nThrough all this, the football season somehow wound to a conclusion. The ability of league administrators to still produce a product was quite something. At one point, with the ladder leaders 35,000 feet in the air and barred from entering Queensland, the AFL\u2019s head of procurement telephoned the cockpit and nutted out a plan. Like last year, the footy helped. At a time when duelling political press conferences were apparently essential viewing, when the delivery of socks and second-hand books provided a dopamine hit, footy injected a bit of drama, and gave us something to lose ourselves in.\nIt was never more evident than the Saturday evening of the final round, when the entire season flipped in about half an hour. Half the men in my suburb, and at least 95% of the baristas, are dead ringers for Max Gawn. As he slotted the winner after the siren, they all revealed themselves as Melbourne supporters, bellowing like loons into the curfewed night.\nFor anyone who has spent nine months in lockdown, it has been a strange time to be a rusted-on fan. It\u2019s like being an Australian based supporter of an English Premier League club. You try and convince yourself that you\u2019re part of it. But you\u2019re a two-dimensional supporter. You\u2019re connected to your team, as one sportswriter wrote last year, \u201clike a patient on an intravenous drip\u201d.\nIn Melbourne, last year\u2019s grand final day couldn\u2019t have been flatter. It was a putrid day. There was the odd couple in Richmond jumpers carting booze. There were a few blundering around the MCG\u2019s outskirts \u2013 almost like homing pigeons, one commentator noted. The Cox Plate was on, but that too was depressing. More so than any other race day, it feeds off the crowd. Online, people were carping about the long wait, demanding to know what the hell they should do with their afternoon.\nAs a fan, if you were ever going to lose one, this was the time to do it. It was all so far removed. You could let it go quickly. It wasn\u2019t as invasive. You could avoid it, rationalise it, assign an asterisk to it. Richmond and Geelong supporters had that luxury. To a lesser extent, Bulldogs fans will as well. But Melbourne supporters won\u2019t. In their only two grand final appearances in half a century, they were lambs to the slaughter. This time they are favourites. This time, they\u2019re the feel-good story.\nIf you are a Demons fan of a certain age, you have watched some of the most wretched teams and endured some of the biggest thumpings in the history of the game. You\u2019ve mourned club legends, former coaches and listed players. Your club has been tainted by tanking allegations, and come close to merging. You\u2019ve been labelled a silvertail, a snow tripper, a tweed wearing twit. You\u2019re hardwired for disappointment. One of your brethren chronicled the club\u2019s woes for a decade and a half, cobbled his columns together and titled it The Great Depression.\nNow you finally have a team you can trust. You have a group of young men completely untrammelled by past failures. They\u2019re on the other side of the country, having a ball, pummelling all in their path. You are distanced from the world, disconnected from your team and slowly losing your mind. You\u2019ve had two weeks to stew over this grand final. On the second last Saturday in September, instead of watching your team at the MCG, you watched protesters being capsicum sprayed. Your city is seething, fractured, and utterly exhausted.\nIn life, the stereotype has it, Melbourne supporters have been hit on the arse by a rainbow. In footballing terms, to run with their most prominent blogger, they have been fisted forever. On Saturday, they are chasing what Collingwood, Sydney, Geelong, Western Bulldogs, and Richmond supporters waited so many decades for. In normal times, this \u201clonging on a large scale\u201d would play out at the MCG, at pubs, at BBQS. In lockdown, everything shrinks. The communal is virtual. You don your scarf, you paint your fence, and you make do. It\u2019s been an excruciating 18 months for all of us. For Melbourne supporters, already at the mercy of lockdown laws, earthquakes, conspiracy theorists, Norm Smith\u2019s curse and Luke Beveridge\u2019s magnets, this will be a special kind of torture.",

        "content": "Controversial restraint will be criminalised after state\u2019s upper house backs bill with unanimous support\nSouth Australia will become the first state to criminalise the use of spit hoods after a bill to ban their use passed a crucial vote in the state\u2019s parliament with unanimous support.\nThe bill was introduced ahead of the five-year anniversary of Wayne Fella Morrison\u2019s death. Morrison, a 29-year-old Wiradjuri, Kokatha and Wirangu man, had not been convicted of any crime and was being held on remand when he died on 26 September 2016 at the Royal Adelaide Hospital after being restrained at Yatala Labour Prison.\nIn the five years since Morrison\u2019s death, his mother, Caroline Andersen, and his sibling, Latoya Rule, have been fighting to ban the use of spit hoods in South Australian institutions while they await the outcome of a coronial inquest into his death in custody. The inquest has run for three years.\nA spit hood is a mesh-fabric hood that covers the face and is fixed at the neck to physically prevent a person from spitting during restraint.\nThe private member\u2019s bill to ban their use was introduced by the SA Best MLC Connie Bonaros in April 2020, and it passed in the Legislative Council on Wednesday night with support from the Greens MLC Tammy Franks and Labor\u2019s Kyam Maher.\nThe South Australian Liberal party is understood to have supported the bill, meaning it is expected to pass an upcoming vote in the House of Assembly and become law.\nWhen it does the ban will end the use of spit hoods across South Australian prisons, mental health institutions and police custody. The ban is expected to be in effect by the end of September.\nSpeaking after the vote, Andersen said the result was a long time coming after the family\u2019s calls for change were ignored for so long.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve finally got there,\u201d Morrison\u2019s mother said.\n\u201cJust knowing that at least in South Australia for the moment, if any professional, whether it be a nurse, doctor or prison officer, police officer, whoever who is in a position of authority, if they were to use one of these devices, it\u2019s against the law now.\n\u201cAnd they would be held responsible.\u201d\nHowever, Rule said the significance of the moment was lost in a sense of \u201cfrustration\u201d that it had taken so much time to get action.\n\u201cThe people of South Australia should question why this was allowed to go on for so long and why those who knew about it didn\u2019t act,\u201d Rule said.\nRule said they appreciated the work of Bonaros and Franks, but was also \u201cproud\u201d to have the support of Maher.\n\u201cHe stood with our community and with Wayne without even knowing him,\u201d Rule said. \u201cI think the Aboriginal community of South Australia can know that Kyam made this move today in support of us, and against Aboriginal deaths in custody.\u201d\nThe family say they are now renewing their calls calling for a formal apology from the South Australian government, a royal commission into Morrison\u2019s death owing to the roadblocks experienced at the coronial inquest, and a national ban on the use of the devices.\nBonaros said she was \u201chumbled and extraordinarily grateful\u201d to be trusted with the bill but that it shouldn\u2019t have taken an \u201cincredible amount of human effort\u201d to achieve the result.\n\u201cIt absolutely shouldn\u2019t have taken this long,\u201d Bonaros said. \u201cIt should not have taken global recognition of Wayne\u2019s death to finally to finally accept that there\u2019s no place for spit hoods in our society.\n\u201cWe should have reached that conclusion a very long time.\u201d\nThe Northern Territory banned the use of spit hoods when images showing their use on 13-year-old Dylan Voller while he was detained at the Don Dale youth detention centre sparked national outrage.\nSouth Australia was the last state to ban their use on children but until now has continued to allow their use on adults.\nAn online petition created by the family has collected more than 26,000 signatures since the campaign began.\nThe coronial inquest into the death Morrison remains ongoing with the coroner Jayne Basheer expected to hear final submissions next Tuesday.",

        "content": "Data also shows that school exclusions for girls are growing at higher rate than for boys\nSome Black and minority ethnic girls in England are more than twice as likely to be excluded from school as their white counterparts, according to a report.\nEquality campaigners have raised the alarm at the findings, which show that the number of girls excluded from education is growing at a significantly higher rate than boys.\nData uncovered by Agenda, an alliance of more than 50 charities campaigning for the most excluded women and girls, through a freedom of information request to the Department for Education, shows that black Caribbean girls were permanently excluded from school at a rate double that of white British girls during the academic year 2019-20, with this tripling for mixed white and Caribbean girls.\nDuring the same time period, girls from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities faced rates of permanent exclusion that were four times higher than those of white British girls.\nWhile boys continue to face higher rates of exclusion overall, the report notes that the number of girls excluded is increasing, with permanent exclusions of girls rising by 66% over the last five years, compared with a 32% increase among boys during the same time period.\nThe figures have led to calls for the Department for Education to routinely publish data relating to school exclusions broken down by sex and ethnicity, and take action on the racial disparities found.\nThe report also includes first-hand accounts of how girls and young women are often excluded from education after having experienced unaddressed sexual harassment and abuse, poor mental health, and racism. The report suggests negative stereotypes attached to black girls and young women, and those from minority ethnic backgrounds, play a critical role in their exclusion.\nMarie, 23, told Agenda that a sexual image was shared without her consent when she was at school. She said: \u201cThat was just like the start of the hell \u2026 From there, I got excluded a few times, just for little things, like setting off the alarm and bunking and stuff like that. I just felt like I gained a stereotype. Like \u2018loud, black girl\u2019, and that really is not tolerated.\n\u201cInstead of being asked, \u2018What\u2019s going on \u2026 Are you OK?\u2019 They asked me about school counselling once \u2026 It was a while after \u2026 I didn\u2019t engage with it.\u201d\nJemima Olchawski, the CEO of Agenda, said: \u201cBlack and minoritised girls and young women tell us that they aren\u2019t being listened to and that racist stereotypes mean their needs are being ignored. With the long-term harms associated with exclusion well established, this isn\u2019t a trend we can allow to continue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a once-in-a-generation crisis and the government\u2019s recovery plan needs to reflect the scale of the challenge. It must address the ways racial inequalities contribute to school exclusions for Black and minoritised girls and invest in specialist services that are able to address the impact of the trauma and disadvantage they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\nA staff member at an alternative provision school said: \u201cI think that many girls are struggling in silence and can often slip through the net more than boys. In my experience, sometimes boys are more likely to say they\u2019re being caught up in something or that they\u2019re doing something that they shouldn\u2019t be, but this doesn\u2019t happen so much with girls. They need that support network in place from the outset and often that\u2019s not there which can make them more vulnerable to being at risk of exclusion.\u201d\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe back headteachers to suspend or permanently exclude pupils where this helps maintain calm classrooms that bring out the best in every child, but this should only be used as a last resort. We expect staff to consider any underlying causes of poor behaviour before making this decision.\n\u201cWe know children and young people from some backgrounds are more likely to be excluded \u2013 that\u2019s why we are working to deliver significantly improved outcomes for children and young people in alternative provision, who are most at risk of permanent exclusion.\u201d\n The headline of this article was amended on 23 September 2021 to clarify that, as the article itself says, it is Black Caribbean girls who are twice as likely to be excluded from schools as white girls; an earlier version had referred only to \u201cBlack girls\u201d.",

        "content": "We\u2019re among the thousands boycotting the UN food summit \u2013 it\u2019s been hijacked by corporate interests while the voices of small-scale farmers go unheard\nThursday\u2019s UN food summit proposes to help solve the world\u2019s nutrition crisis, with 800 million people going hungry and 1.9 billion labelled obese, by better aligning food systems with development goals. But it won\u2019t achieve any of this. The summit was hijacked early on by powerful corporate interests \u2013 but people are resisting.\nHundreds of social movements and civil society groups across the world representing small-scale and subsistence food producers, consumers and environmentalists are protesting about the summit for being undemocratic, non-transparent and focused only on strengthening only one food system: that backed by the big corporations. Civil society bodies active at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for instance, are running a massive grassroots boycott of the summit, and there is a website and several actions dedicated to it. Grain, a small nonprofit group campaigning for biodiversity-based food systems, shut down its website and social media in protest on Thursday and many other organisations are holding their own protests around the world. An online alternative forum in July, running in parallel with the pre-summit meeting in Rome, attracted about 9,000 participants. This week, even more are expected.\nEven the scientific community is walking out on this farcical effort to address the urgent challenges facing our food systems. It is especially concerned about the summit creating a new scientific agency to justify its agenda, undermining existing UN bodies already responsible for this work. Mainstream development agencies are also starting to question the wisdom of the current direction of travel. The UN Environment Programme has just issued a scathing nine-point assessment of the industrial food system. In a recent joint report, three UN bodies assailed the $540bn (\u00a3396bn) of agricultural subsidies that governments currently hand out for promoting food systems that are \u201charmful for the environment and human health\u201d. Also, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food has rebuked the summit for its corporate bias and lack of a human rights framework.\nSo why is the summit facing such widespread opposition? The main reason is that organisers have given agribusiness a lead role in the process and largely ignored the social movements and small farmers\u2019 organisations around the world that produce the majority of the world\u2019s food. As a result, the summit will unavoidably push for an industrialised and corporate-driven food system, undermining the future of the millions of small-scale farmers, fishers, herders, food vendors and processors across the world.\nIn contrast, small farmers\u2019 movements such as La Via Campesina and its allies are presenting a very different future. La Via Campesina launched its vision of \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d 25 years ago, at the 1996 world food summit. Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It is based on a model of small-scale sustainable production benefiting communities and the environment. Food sovereignty prioritises local food production and consumption, giving a country the right to protect its producers from cheap imports and to control its production.\nIt includes the struggle for land and genuine agrarian reform that ensures the rights to use and manage lands, territories, water, seeds, livestock and biodiversity are in the hands of those who produce food and not of the corporate sector. La Via Campesina sees agroecology as a viable alternative to the industrial food system. It recognises that small farmers, including fishers, pastoralists and indigenous people, who make up almost half the world\u2019s population, are capable of producing food for their communities and feeding the world in a sustainable and healthy way.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the current global food system needs a massive overhaul. It is being torn apart by inequality, environmental destruction, the climate crisis, worker and human rights abuses, all of which were laid bare by the Covid pandemic. But peasant movements have a viable alternative. One where the needs of most of the world\u2019s food producers and consumers are put at the centre of the food system, where their voices are heard and where sustainability and the climate are the main concerns. The UN Food System Summit, unfortunately, does not want to hear this.\nElizabeth Mpofu a member of Zimbabwe Smallholder Organic Farmers\u2019 Forum (Zimsoff) and general coordinator of La Via Campesina, and Henk Hobbelink is coordinator of Grain.\n This article was amended on 26 September 2021. Text was changed to clarify that, according to the UN, family farmers produce a majority of the world\u2019s food. A previous version gave the figure as \u201ca third\u201d; this was introduced in the editing process and related to small farms of less than two hectares.",

Girls!\u201d A reply from the first floor of the pavilion came back just as loud. \u201cYes mum?\u201d Then \u201cCome back out on the balcony, your dad wants to take a photo.\u201d Three giggling teenagers filed out of the home dressing room, where they had been taking turns to sit in what the attendant had just told them was Joe Root\u2019s usual spot.\nAlastair Cook says he used to dream about playing at Lord\u2019s when he was a kid. In his mind\u2019s eye, Harold Pinter always saw it the way he did when he skipped school to watch Yorkshire and arrived in time to see Len Hutton hit a cut up the slope. In Tarsao prisoner-of-war camp, Jim Swanton used to entertain the other captives by conjuring accounts of the matches he saw at Lord\u2019s before the second world war. Charlie Watts wanted to take John Arlott\u2019s commentary along as one of his Desert Island Discs because it reminded him of \u201cgoing along with Mick to Lord\u2019s, and England in summer\u201d. For a certain type of English fan, Lord\u2019s has always been home.\nNone of them ever saw the place look quite like it did on Monday, when the MCC Foundation hosted the finals of its first national hubs competition. There were two matches, one between girls teams from Bradford and the Cotswolds, one between boys sides from Slough and Manchester. The players were all state school kids, 15 and under, the spectators all families and coaches. For years, England\u2019s women have struggled to get games at Lord\u2019s, there are current internationals who have never played a match there and a few days ago a bunch of happy schoolkids had the run of the place.\n\u201cMaybe you need to know some of the history to understand how great this is,\u201d says Isa Guha, a former England cricketer and now a commentator and presenter. \u201cWatching these girls from Bradford walk into the Long Room when for almost 200 years women weren\u2019t allowed into the pavilion.\u201d\nThe MCC used to run the game. Until 1989, their chair also served by right as the chair of the ICC. It sometimes feels like the club has lost an empire and are looking for a role. The foundation seems the closest they have come to finding it. It supports overseas projects in Lebanon and Nepal, but does most of its work at home, running a network of 65 hubs for nearly 3,000 state school children, mostly in underprivileged areas. The foundation\u2019s director is Sarah Fane, who used to run Afghan Connection, building schools (and cricket pitches) in Afghanistan.\nFor all the obstacles the women\u2019s game faced, and still faces, in Afghanistan, Fane says, in her experience, \u201cpeople had total belief that it could be a game for them, they never questioned it, however disadvantaged they were and whatever background they came from. They\u2019d pick up a bat and they\u2019d play. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the same in the UK.\u201d\nGuha says: \u201cWhen I go to places like India, Australia, everyone knows what cricket is. In England, you don\u2019t have to go far beyond your circle of friends to find out quite quickly that cricket is not on everyone\u2019s radar.\u201d Guha got into cricket through her brother. To play at school, she had to set up her own girls team.\nIn the box next door, I spoke to Cordelia Griffith, who plays for Middlesex and the Manchester Originals. She is the only child of Frank Griffith, who spent almost a decade at Derbyshire. She was the only female player in her school year and played on an all-boys team. \u201cSome of my female friends would have loved to have tried it, but would have been more comfortable playing with other girls, like you can at MCC Hubs.\u201d\nThe hub project is about opening up a pathway into the game for people who aren\u2019t at private school, who don\u2019t have parents who play or can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, join local clubs.\nMark Roche, CEO of the Berkshire Cricket Foundation, was there watching Slough. \u201cSeventy per cent of that side don\u2019t play any club cricket,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s one club in Slough borough, and none at all in Reading borough, so you\u2019ve got a quarter of a million people with one club.\u201d\nRoche has worked in the sport for the best part of 20 years. \u201cWhen the hub project was proposed we weren\u2019t quite sure what to do with it. Now I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d do without it, it\u2019s become an integral part of what we do.\u201d\nIn the background to it all, and everything else in English cricket, is the Hundred, a competition with the same sort of aim, on a bigger scale. Everyone I talked to swore by it, Griffith, who played in it, Guha, who presented it, Roche, who watched it.\n\u201cHaving it on terrestrial TV was immense,\u201d Roche says. \u201cI took kids who aren\u2019t interested in cricket to the Ageas and they came away absolutely buzzing. The beauty of it is there was a Hundred game on TV the next day and they could buy the Match Attax cards from the shop, watch clips online and they got bitten by it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the game was trying to achieve with the Hundred, bringing it to people who don\u2019t do cricket.\u201d\nGuha says: \u201cThe biggest thing now is building that connection between the Hundred and the rest of the cricket in our country. How do you harness that interest and make people want to come back for more?\u201d\nThe foundation are already planning 10 new hubs, all for girls, all dreaming of Lord\u2019s, which is beginning to look, at last, like a home for all English cricket.\n This article was amended on 7 October 2021.

Think of La Haine and Ladj Ly\u2019s recent Les Mis\u00e9rables \u2013 angry films about the pressure cooker caused by poverty, police racism, underfunding and official neglect. Now with their mesmerising debut, Fanny Liatard and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Trouilh bring something different to the suburbs. The pair filmed this poetic movie, with its streak of magical realism, in Cit\u00e9 Gagarine, a redbrick housing estate on the outskirts of Paris, just before it was demolished in 2019. Built in 1961, it was named after Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. Which might explain why this is a movie looking up at the stars.\nIt opens with actual footage of Gagarin visiting in the early 60s, mobbed by a cheering crowd, showered in a confetti of rose petals. The residents beam with optimism; the estate gleams. Fast forward 50 or so years, and the place is beyond repair, with cracks in the walls, asbestos, rat infestation, and dealers in the corridors. But Gagarine is the only home that Youri (Als\u00e9ni Bathily) has known; he\u2019s a bright, space-obsessed 16-year-old with a gorgeously shy smile. And like many kids on the estate, he\u2019s from an immigrant family. These days it\u2019s just him and his mum, who is mostly off with her new boyfriend; but Youri is surrounded by neighbours who keep an eye on him. The film is very good at showing the community of the Gagarine without downplaying its problems. \u201cWe\u2019re angry, but we\u2019re happy here,\u201d says one man to the council.\nYouri has an idealistic plan to fix up the building: get the lifts working, replace lightbulbs in communal areas. Then the authorities won\u2019t be able demolish it, will they? He sets to work with his best friend Houssam (Jamil McCraven) and Diana (Lyna Khoudri), a girl from the local Roma community. Of course, that\u2019s not how building regs work. And when the demolition crew moves in, Youri stays put, hiding in the flat, transforming it into a mini spaceship, complete with a UV-lit greenhouse. It\u2019s here that the storytelling takes on a gravity-defying lightness with a couple of moments that bring a Close Encounters of the Third Kind sense of wonder to the movie.\n Gagarine is released on 24 September in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",

        "content": "Available onlineThere are spirited performances as Roy Williams explores activism, parenthood and sexuality in this audio drama about black British identity spanning 40 years\nRoy Williams\u2019s audio drama pans over the past 40 years through the prism of one extended black British family. The story begins with a nation divided by Enoch Powell\u2019s anti-immigrant fervour and arrives at Brexit Britain and the BLM protests of last summer. This intergenerational journey creates a semblance of forward movement but Williams\u2019s script points to the dismal circularity of the fights fought then and now.\nProduced by Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh as part of the Sound Stage series, the play has a plot that hinges on police brutality and a cover-up that sees Neil (Cyril Nri) wrongfully imprisoned in his teens. Alongside the woefully familiar subject matter of police violence, Williams is not afraid to grapple with the lesser explored complexities of racial tensions between the Asian and black communities in Britain, too.\nComprising six interconnected monologues and duologues, its structure offers a survey of our times, even if this feels too broad-brush and brief. It begins with mutual hostility between an Asian shopkeeper and a group of young black men, and goes in some unexpected directions after a violent flashpoint to explore sexuality, absent fatherhood, domestic violence and activism within black British identity.\nDirected by Ben Occhipinti, some parts of the drama feel like character studies filled with expositional statements. Confusingly, some monologues are narrated by unnamed characters and we are left to map out complex dynastic connections without clear enough signposting.\nThe cast is spirited nonetheless; Sharon D Clarke is particularly strong as Gwen, the sister of a key character, although her monologue in itself seems little more than a summary of her life that feeds the plot. Oliver Alvin-Wilson, as young gay man Jordan, speaks of his sexual desire with vulnerability and tenderness.\nThere is an exploration of how children relate to their fathers in Jordan\u2019s storyline, and also in the last duologue between Neil and his daughter Claire (Amaka Okafor), which bears echoes of Williams\u2019s recent \u2013 and excellent \u2013 short play in NW Trilogy at the Kiln theatre in London. But here the emotional reckoning is interrupted, and ultimately side-tracked, by rousing calls to activism by Claire. \u201cThis is your country, never forget that,\u201d she tells him, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s still going on, you know. The beatings, the arrests, the cover-ups.\u201d\nThe drama is kept afloat by a buoyant soundtrack, the historical sweep captured superbly by musical interludes (composed by Darren J Benjamin) and news reports that draw our mind to historic moments, from Charles and Diana\u2019s wedding to the Brixton riots and Boris Johnson\u2019s Covid-era statement to \u201cstay at home\u201d. Even among these extraordinary events across the span of time, we are left with a sense of a hostile history repeating itself on the lives of these characters.\nAvailable online from 24-26 September via Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum.",

        "content": "What\u2019s the hot new colour, according to London fashion week? Anything you want, so long as it\u2019s bright and bold. And the more you mix things up, the better\nAt first I thought London fashion week was going to be all about parma violet. \u201cDid you know purple flowers attract the most bees?\u201d Roland Mouret asked, as I stroked a low-backed silk blouse in pale, luminous lavender on a rail in his studio on the first day. Pantone had just announced Orchid Bloom as one of its key colours for 2022.\n  Then I changed my mind, and became convinced that apple green had it in the bag. Alice Temperley\u2019s collection sold me on a halter-neck gown and a wrap dress, both in the bold mid-green, halfway between lime and emerald, that Americans call Kelly green and that reminds me of biting into a crisp granny smith. That sharp, outdoorsy green has been on the ascent in fashion for a while, beloved by label of the moment Bottega Veneta.\nBut as shows went on over the weekend, one catwalk was a riot of yolk yellow and the one after that was a symphony in shades of orange and burgundy, and it dawned on me that there is no one colour of next season. Instead, next season is all about colour. Real colour, mind. Not the chalky, unusual shades that fashion tends to fall for \u2013 milky off-white pecorino, soft Tiepolo pink, rich espresso brown \u2013 but the brash shades you find in a box of crayons or a pack of highlighters, the colours of the neons at Piccadilly Circus or in an amusement arcade.\n\u201cColour is like sunshine on your face,\u201d Mouret told me. \u201cColour therapy really works. It makes you feel happy.\u201d Designer Rejina Pyo, who not only paired a Lucozade blouse with a lime pencil skirt in her show but, at eight months pregnant, took her bow wearing the same colour combination, said colour brought \u201ca sense of freedom which I\u2019ve been longing for. Life has been all rules and guidelines, for so long.\u201d\nBright colour is about optimism, and it is also about breaking free of monotony. This makes sense, for this moment in time, when an era of hybrid working patterns means that for many of us the week is finding a new rhythm \u2013 an uneven mix of commuting and home working, of Pret sandwiches and fridge leftovers. The old routine in which five days out of seven marched to the drum of the train timetable and office hours is no longer standard. One working day doesn\u2019t always look like another any more. There is room for different looks, and different colours.\n Bright colours make me happy, partly because they are what I wear on holiday. I am not alone in that, and the holiday-suitcase appeal of coral and fuchsia, sky blue and lime is part of the attraction. A sunny holiday is right at the top of the post-pandemic wishlist for many of us, so clothes that remind us of bikinis, strappy dresses and maxi skirts that have been packed in a box for two years feel more appealing than ever.\nVictoria Beckham said she was \u201cdrawn to the elegance of a European summer\u201d and \u201cthe way a trip like that can make you feel quite detached from reality\u201d when she designed her new collection, which goes on sale next spring. Her new long dresses in dandelion and marmalade had a drinks-at-golden-hour energy that feels hard to resist. Meanwhile, Emilia Wickstead had Leonardo DiCaprio in a Hawaiian shirt in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Romeo + Juliet in mind when she put turquoise-and-white florals with apricot-and-white ones this season.\n\u201cIf people do not notice you, you might as well not exist,\u201d read a note handed out at Bora Aksu\u2019s show. The quote was by Aksu\u2019s muse for the season, the late Dutch socialite Mathilde Willink, known for her exuberant dress sense and hedonistic lifestyle. Little chance of slipping under the radar in emerald tailoring over pink tulle, or ballet-slipper pink blouse with pineapple trousers. \u201cI like finding a balance point between colours that don\u2019t normally work together,\u201d Aksu said after the show. There is something compelling about unexpected colour combinations that goes beyond mere beauty. \u201cI like the way that colours have a conversation, when you put them together,\u201d says Pyo. \u201cWhen you put lime green next to orange, or lavender with pink, it\u2019s like matchmaking \u2013 you try it out and see how the energy feels.\u201d\n Some of fashion\u2019s rainbows appeared a result of shifting to a more sustainable, less wasteful mindset. \u201cIt just felt wrong to order new fabric, this season,\u201d said Edeline Lee, a London-based, British-Canadian designer whose clothes have been worn by everyone from Helen Mirren to Taylor Swift. \u201cSo I decided to use up all the leftover fabrics in my studio \u2013 we ended up with 53 colours in the collection.\u201d Lee found that jigsawing together these odds and ends proved satisfyingly creative \u2013 as is often the way, when cooking with leftovers. \u201cIf I order new fabric, then the logistics of a business my size means that I order only a certain number,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHaving 53 to play with was fun.\u201d Aqua ended up spliced with chocolate brown, peach and coral with lawn green.\n The days when sophisticates wore black and bright colours were basic are long gone. Decades gone, in fact. In 1997 Matthew Williamson\u2019s Electric Angels collection put Kate Moss in a peppermint cardigan with a fuchsia skirt, and fashion has never really been the same since. These days, on a catwalk front row the woman wearing all black is likely to be the Love Island contestant, while the woman wearing lime with crimson is a painter or a poet. Roksanda Ilin\u010di\u0107 is a peerless colourist, her every show a bewitching masterclass in gloriously unexpected combinations of shades.\nThis season, for a collection printed with Joan Didion quotes and worn in the Serpentine Gallery show by a mix of models and dancers, Ilin\u010di\u0107 combined tobacco, coffee and coral in one dress, and yellow, merlot, pink and turquoise in another. \u201cI\u2019ve always been about colour and this season, after life has felt kind of small, I wanted everything to feel amplified again. Bigger, and brighter, like light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d she said. A Harrods buyer made the point that far from seeming un-serious, the colours are crucial in what makes Roksanda resonate with \u201ca confident, intellectual and artistic woman\u201d.\n Knocked on to the back foot by a year without anything to get dressed up for, and by the gathering storm of the climate emergency, fashion right now lacks both the authority and the swagger to issue a diktat anointing one colour, or one hemline, as the New Look. Instead, London fashion week made the case for fashion to be a source of joy again. The rainbow as a trend doesn\u2019t come with a shopping list. If anything, it is a call to action to get more wear out of pieces you already own, but don\u2019t often wear. Next time you open your wardrobe, instead of reaching for the neutral failsafes, give that pink skirt that you\u2019ve never worn because you can\u2019t quite figure out what it would work with a go. Or maybe the lime cardigan. Actually, I\u2019ve got a better idea: why not both?",

        "content": "Club\u2019s head of performance talks about coaching the Afghan women\u2019s national team and being \u2018100% herself\u2019 in her new role\n\u201cWe\u2019re eager to do something that the world doesn\u2019t believe is possible, to take this little club and become champions on the world stage and make sure we do it with all the right values,\u201d says Lewes\u2019s new head of performance and former head coach of the Afghanistan women\u2019s team, Kelly Lindsey.\nFew people could talk of such lofty ambitions for the south coast team, whose men play in the Isthmian League Premier Division and women in the Women\u2019s Championship, and be taken seriously. Lindsey, though, comes with strong credentials on and off the pitch and feels like the missing piece in the developing project at Lewes, bringing elite performance know-how to the community-owned club that funds its women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams equally.\nLindsey\u2019s journey from Omaha, Nebraska, to the small town of Lewes, a former home of Rights of Man writer Thomas Paine, has been a winding one.\nIn 2001 Lindsey was the No 1 first round draft pick for the San Jose CyberRays in the second incarnation of a professional women\u2019s league in the US. The defender was named Soccer America\u2019s rookie of the year in a first championship-winning season in California. She made the US women\u2019s national team but was forced to retire at just 23 after 10 knee surgeries in 10 years.\nFortunately, Lindsey has been coaching since she was 13, taking what she had learned at regional and national youth camps back to Omaha.\n\u201cMy first national team camp was under-16, I was 13 years old when I first went in. I came from a place where my dad was my coach. I didn\u2019t really ever have a professional coach in the youth set-up and I went to the national team and I saw these players coming from all the big places, California, New Jersey, Texas, Michigan and Florida, that\u2019s where all the big-time players were being made, and I was just a little pawn in that world. So I came back to my hometown and just thought: \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve gained all this knowledge, I want to give it to the kids in my community\u2019.\u201d\nOmaha, a place where \u201cpeople take care of each other and community matters and your neighbours look out for you\u201d says Lindsey, helped form her coaching philosophy and outlook. \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older I\u2019ve realised that how I lead and how I coach and how I think about players\u2019 livelihoods and life and their experience through football is really based on having grown up in a really positive place where people and coaches cared about me as a human.\u201d\nLindsey coached at the University of Colorado, University of Texas and Saint Mary\u2019s before taking the assistant coach job at Sky Blue FC (now NJ/NY Gotham FC). She ended up as head coach and won the league.\nShe went back into college football before stepping away from the sport. \u201cI asked myself am I doing this because I really love it, or am I doing this because it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever done?\u201d\nLindsey learned lessons about herself after a career change. \u201cI realised through life coaching that so many people at high levels in their life didn\u2019t get important life lessons because they didn\u2019t play team sports, and it sort of took me full circle and reinvigorated me to get back into football coaching.\u201d\nAt the Julie Foudy Sports Leadership Academy she met some players from Afghanistan and after some attempts to coordinate with the team she was asked by Khalida Popal, one of the founders, to coach the national side.\n\u201cShe basically said: \u2018You know what we really need is a good coach and we need someone who understands what we\u2019re trying to build and that it\u2019s bigger than football.\u2019\u201d\nCoaching the team, including helping the players expose brutal abuses suffered at the hands of the federation president and helping them flee the country after the recent surge to power of the Taliban, taught her that \u201cyou\u2019re significantly insignificant\u201d. \u201cThis is my mantra from working with these girls. It\u2019s humbling when you can\u2019t communicate in the same way, verbally, how do you connect with humans? When you can\u2019t verbally teach, how do you help them teach each other?\n\u201cHow do you build a culture when they come from a place where they don\u2019t trust anyone? They don\u2019t trust their neighbours, often they don\u2019t even trust their own family. How do you build trust among these women and allow them to lead each other? It\u2019s a very humbling experience but one I would not ever change, they\u2019ve helped me in my life probably more than I\u2019ve helped them.\u201d\nHaving worked as women\u2019s football director for the Moroccan football federation and head coach of its women\u2019s national team, Lindsey has now landed in south east England and feels more at home than in a long time.\n\u201cOften when you have such deep values, you don\u2019t know where you fit in,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to come to a place and just be like: \u2018I get to just be myself. I don\u2019t have to question my integrity. I don\u2019t have to make decisions I don\u2019t believe in. I can 100% be myself.\u2019\u201d\nThe equality message of the club and community values were the big pull. \u201cSo much that is holding back sport in general, but especially women\u2019s sport, is just because we don\u2019t view life equally. It\u2019s so important that we can help transition the mentality, within the club and among the people we work with but also with every team that we play against and as we stretch out into England and across the world.\n\u201cWe can help people see that you can really perform at a high level, care, equally, and make professional decisions equally for men and women, because: why not? Why are men and women not considered equal on this planet? I will never understand. I think we can send a really powerful message to the world.\u201d",

The man appeared to be talking calmly to other officers at the time.\nA Victoria police spokesperson said the police were aware of the footage and the professional standards command was investigating the incident.\nThe civil rights group Liberty Victoria was concerned about the footage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply concerning. Incidents like that can motivate others in a deleterious way,\u201d spokesperson Michael Stanton said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t say police have an easy job \u2013 far from it. We\u2019ve seen some shocking scenes of protesters hurling abuse or worse, we\u2019ve seen police getting injured and hospitalised and that\u2019s terrible, but what you don\u2019t want in that situation is to have a disproportionate use of force that could itself spark further unrest.\u201d\nMelbourne Activist Legal Support has been monitoring the protests, and spokesperson Anthony Kelly said it was a takedown technique that had been used before and was potentially excessive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that the police are investigating it and a positive sign, but what we always say with this is that these sort of incidents require [an] independent investigative model to really get to the bottom of it, because they keep happening.\u201d\nThe protests that have seized Australia\u2019s second-largest city for days had their genesis with members of the powerful Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), who were resisting a government mandate for compulsory coronavirus vaccinations for workers on building sites.\nBut the initial rally has been seized upon by anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown groups, some including members of the far right, who have organised the rallies over social media sites including Facebook and Telegram.\nIn the two days since the initial protests, the police presence in the city has expanded significantly, with riot police and large police vehicles out in force across the CBD. There have been more than 200 arrests, and on Wednesday after a three-hour stand-off with protesters at the Shrine of Remembrance, police used non-lethal rounds and teargas to disperse the crowd.\nPolice said a further 92 people were arrested on Thursday, and the police plan to provide a \u201chighly visible presence\u201d across the city over the next few days.\nKelly said the police\u2019s staged response at the war memorial, where police gave several warnings and allowed protesters to leave, had been noted but the use of non-lethal rounds and teargas could cause serious and permanent injury, and risked being an excessive use of force.\nStanton said Liberty Victoria was deeply concerned about whether the response from Victoria police had been proportionate, and whether the use of such tactics for the current protests would be normalised in future protests outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cCertainly, the police were confronted with some worrying conduct in these recent protests, but we\u2019re very concerned that a militarisation of the police response could become normalised for future peaceful protests.\u201d\nKelly said the normalisation process was complex, and if the public supported some of the measures being used then that will factor into whether police feel they can use such measures.\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting and hoping the police will roll back all of this crowd control technology very quickly and also not deploy it at all when it\u2019s not needed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt should only be deployed when it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d\nThe Herald Sun also reported police would be scouring CCTV footage from the city to find and prosecute those who attended the protests. The report suggested police would be attempting to identify people manually, however Victoria police has previously trialled facial recognition technology.\nA Victoria police spokesperson refused to say how the force was identifying protesters, stating it would reveal methodology.\nThe Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday thanked the police for their \u201coutstanding work\u201d on Wednesday.\n\u201cPolice were very effective yesterday and I thank them for putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to keep the rest of us safe,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI would hope that today and in days to come there is not a need for that, that people are following the rules, doing the right thing, so we can get construction open.\u201d\nAhead of the earlier protests on Saturday, the Human Rights Law Centre called on the Victorian government and the police to be transparent around the justification of the police response, including showing how much Covid-19 transmission has occurred at previous protests.",

Its graceful red sandstone architecture, with two cathedrals and splendid university buildings dating from the 15th century, gives the city the quality of an alfresco cultural living room \u2013 where academics, students and locals live on a sort of dreamy, theatrical open-air film set.

More romanesque churches (24) than any other city, with their pink-tinged sandstone glowing warmly in the sunlight. Add to this the Baltasar Lobo sculpture museum near the medieval castle, the Duero wines from the surrounding gentle hills, the famous Holy Week processions, an eclectic collection of art deco buildings and you might not find time for the greatest gem of all, the Visigothic church of San Pedro de la Nave, 12 kilometres to the northwest.James Kay\n Guardian Travel readers' tips\nEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

A heavenly city roughly one hour north-west of Madrid. I lived there for my Erasmus year but still sigh whenever I think about it. The centrepiece of this stunning place is the Roman aqueduct, built in the first century AD. If that doesn\u2019t impress you then the Disney-inspiring Alcazar certainly will. The cathedral is the most modern gothic one in Europe, and Segovia offers beautiful views whichever way you are facing. For award-winning tapas pop to El Fog\u00f3n Sefard\u00ed, or for casual bites go to El Sitio. This is a treasure trove of gastronomic and architectural delights, not to be missed!Rhiannon Pattison\nThe Spanish town that will definitely take your breath away is Ronda (in the province of M\u00e1laga, Andaluc\u00eda). Between a 150m-deep rocky gorge, which you can admire from the bridge called Puente Nuevo, Ronda is a perfect place to see architecture influenced by the Romans, Arabs and the Catholic Monarchs. Going down the steps of the Water Mine at Casa del Rey Moro, admiring omnipresent beautiful mosaics, strolling around Ronda\u2019s cobbled streets and passing by the oldest bullfighting rings in Spain, Plaza de Toros de Ronda, are some of the things you can do in beautiful Ronda!Magdalena Rasmus \nWe had little knowledge of what Vigo would be like before we visited it in 2017. What we found was a bustling port city with welcoming people and delicious food. Being on the Galician coast means the local speciality of octopus is abundant. Every restaurant does their own version of this delightful, meaty delicacy. In contrast to the prices in some of Spain\u2019s more popular cities, Vigo is affordable \u2013 for less than \u20ac2 you could have a beer, or small glass of wine, and a small, free tapas. The highlight of our visit was a trip to the Cies Islands (a 45-minute ferry from Vigo), with golden beaches that have, rightfully, been named among the most beautiful in the world.Graham Tait\nTarazona, halfway between Soria and Zaragoza, has kept its medieval Arabic street plan and is therefore easy to get lost in. From the Romanesque church of St Mary Magdalene, high above the town, you can admire the ancient roofs and see the pattern of the town, with the 18th-century bullring at its centre, and, opposite, the Mud\u00e9jar Cathedral, with its gothic wall paintings and amazing windows. In between are the hanging houses of the Jewish quarter, the ornate Renaissance town hall, and clusters of friendly bars and restaurants. At Easter it\u2019s columns of women who carry the statue and beat the drums in the procession from St Mary Magdalene, and at that time of year the storks are everywhere.Barbara Forbes\nToledo is my best Spanish city. You feel like you are living in old centuries, or you are watching a real life of ancient soldiers. You even think that you are a warrior and you have to win the battle. It is really an interesting city with extraordinary walls and gates. After one hour\u2019s walking, you will find the best view ever at mirador, where you can see a panoramic view all over the city. It is really so unique and you will fall in love with the majesty of this city.Doris\nAmong the rolling landscapes by the Duero River, a gem of a small town is waiting to be discovered. Midway between Zaragoza and Valladolid, El Burgo de Osma is a treasure trove of history, from Roman ruins, a medieval castle, to perfectly preserved city walls, beautifully manicured gardens and an elegant plaza mayor. The centrepiece, though, is the magnificent cathedral, built of honey-coloured stone over five centuries. We stayed in a spacious, stylish apartment at El Balc\u00f3n de la Catedral overlooking the cathedral square for \u20ac60. The historical centre is barred to traffic, so wander the streets, grab a table, soak it in. It\u2019ll probably be just you and the locals.Jean Rich\nThe warmth of the Spanish sun is second only to the warmth of the heart and soul of the ancient city of C\u00e1diz. An island, not geographically speaking, but surrounded almost entirely by water. The scenes and beautiful beaches of C\u00e1diz rival any Andaluc\u00edan paradise. The endless maze of streets are lined with lively taverns and stunning buildings, providing enough adventures for a lifetime. The Atlantic Ocean plays a vital role in the life of the city, crashing against the city walls and filling the plates with an endless bounty of fresh seafood and fuelling the energy of its citizens come carnival day. In C\u00e1diz, every day feels like carnival day.Elliot Greest\nThe medieval town of Trujillo, in the unjustly overlooked province of Extremadura, made a surprisingly stunning stopoff on our road trip to catch the Bilbao ferry. Our excellent boutique accommodation was in an unassuming street; however, a 20-yard stroll brought us to the main square. More Game of Thrones than Game of Thrones, the panorama was stunning: medieval buildings encircled the square, which was in turn encircled with battlements. A multitude of bell towers rose around us, and a distinguished church took centre stage alongside an oversize statue of conquistador Pizarro. Evening dinner in the square was a delight, local peasant derived food washed down with an Extremadura red.Douglas Stewart",

Created and directed by Kevin Finnan for a cast of seven, all on top form, Nobody is an incredible ensemble piece. There is no sense that the men carry the women; everyone here is weightless, everyone can lift a house.\nThe performers clamber, swing and chuck each other round a metallic cube, sometimes cloaked in fabric and projected upon, in front of an enormous screen. The illusion-like projections are bafflingly smart, giving us vertigo rushes as they zoom from the top of a skyscraper to a street corner, and twisting at angles you\u2019d think impossible for the technology to keep up with. But the aesthetics have a shallowness to them, the images evoking generic desktop backgrounds.\nThe story follows a group of friends who are watched over by a murder of crows in glittering harnesses, the birds representing an inner part of themselves that they must escape. The plot is the least coherent element of the show, but there\u2019s too much excitement elsewhere to worry about that. There is a dizzying swiftness in the constant flurry of the clever choreography\u2019s montage-like movements, in the easy way they lift each other with one hand and then shrug them off as if they don\u2019t weigh a thing.\nThe second act largely does without the projections and is less plot driven \u2013 and better for it. It immerses itself in the endlessly impressive ways the dancers glide off and climb on each other\u2019s bodies: each thigh, shoulder, hand, another rung of their climbing frame.

        "content": "In his own words, the film-maker Melvin Van Peebles, who has died aged 89, was \u201cthe Rosa Parks of the industry\u201d. He was one of the few African-American directors to have moved within the Hollywood studio system when, in 1970, Columbia gave him a three-picture contract. But Columbia balked at the incendiary plot of his next project, about a black hustler who kills white police officers and escapes scot-free, so Van Peebles borrowed $50,000 from the actor Bill Cosby, raised an additional $150,000, and launched an independent production as writer, director, producer, editor, composer and lead actor.\nShot guerrilla-style over 19 days, Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971) was a huge commercial success and effectively launched the blaxploitation genre, which gave black actors an unprecedented array of leading roles. However, Van Peebles was ambivalent about the genre, as he believed it often sidelined the political motives of his own film. It was a retaliation against Hollywood\u2019s default modes of black characterisation: silent subservience or the stately Sidney Poitier mould. The opening sequence lists the main stars as \u201cthe black community\u201d.\nIn the first scene, a boy loses his virginity to a sex worker. The child is Sweetback \u2013 played in adulthood in the rest of the film by Van Peebles, and in this prelude by Van Peebles\u2019s 13-year-old son, Mario. (More than 30 years later, Mario directed Baadasssss!, about the making of his father\u2019s classic, with Mario playing Melvin.) Melvin took the role of Sweetback in his own film because he claimed that no actors were interested in a character who speaks barely a dozen words (mostly expletives) and makes a living performing sexual acts.\nWhen Sweetback witnesses the assault of a black man by racist white police officers, he attacks them and flees. The film\u2019s most enduring images are of Van Peebles running, sporting golden flares, a billowing black shirt and a droopy moustache. The sequences are visually and sonically inventive: there are freeze-frames, psychedelic colours, superimposed images and a throbbing jazz-funk undercurrent.\nWhen Van Peebles came to promote the film, he supplied radio stations with his own infectious musical composition. The film\u2019s score, performed by Earth, Wind and Fire, was released by Stax Records. When the film was assigned a prohibitive X rating, Van Peebles printed T-shirts stating \u201cRated X by an all-white jury\u201d, drummed up local support, had the film screened in community halls and makeshift venues, and virtually hustled it into cinemas.\nHe had learned the art of the hustle from his father, a tailor who ran a shop on the South Side of Chicago, where Melvin was born, the son of Marion and Edwin Peebles. (Melvin added \u201cVan\u201d to his name when he moved to Holland in his late 20s.) By the age of 10, he was working on the cash register in his father\u2019s shop, and selling old clothes on the streets. He attended Thornton Township high school in Harvey, Illinois, and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953 with a degree in English.\nHe joined the US Air Force, served as a navigator and bombardier in Strategic Air Command, and married a German photographer, Maria Marx, with whom he had two sons, Mario and Max, and a daughter, Megan. A period spent working in San Francisco as a cable car operator inspired him to write the book The Big Heart (1957). He also painted and, taking inspiration from Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s collection of essays Film Form, picked up the basics of film-making.\nAfter making a series of short films, he relocated to Holland, where he studied astronomy at the University of Amsterdam. Then he settled in Paris and contributed cartoon strips to the satirical magazine Hara-Kiri. He wrote a handful of novels in French, including La Permission. His film-making was encouraged by Henri Langlois of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, which had screened his shorts, and Van Peebles decided to adapt La Permission for his first feature, a French production released as The Story of a Three-Day Pass (1968).\nA frank account of rank and race in the army, the film follows a black soldier stationed in France who receives a promotion and is given some time off before starting his new position. Dogged by the thought that he has become his white captain\u2019s \u201cUncle Tom\u201d, he embarks for Paris. Van Peebles shot the cafes and stalls of the Left Bank in a freewheeling documentary style. The soldier meets and dances with a white girl and arranges to spend the next day with her by the beach. There, they are spotted by three white men from the base; shocked to see the interracial couple, they report back to the captain, who swiftly demotes the soldier.\nThe film, punctuated by jazzy bursts of music, has more than a frisson of the French New Wave, a touch of the absurd, and the humour and jaded irony of the blues. In one of the most powerful sequences, the couple awkwardly check in to a hotel and make love in a disarming montage incorporating images of warfare, chorus lines and race demonstrations. The film won an award at the San Francisco film festival where, Van Peebles recalled with some amusement, they were surprised to discover that the Dutch-sounding director of this French production was an African American. He was then signed up to direct Watermelon Man (1970), a provocative comedy written by Herman Raucher about a racist white salesman, Jeff, who wakes up one morning to find that his skin has turned black.\nThe producers wanted to cast a white actor who would then appear in blackface after the transformation, but Van Peebles won the argument to use a black star (Godfrey Cambridge) who would then be done up in \u201cwhiteface\u201d. He also altered the original ending of the film, in which the salesman woke up to find that it had all been a bad dream; Van Peebles didn\u2019t want to equate life as an African American with a nightmare.\nAlthough the film was made with some of his trademark experimental flourishes \u2013 including colour filters \u2013 it is essentially a broad domestic comedy, well played by Cambridge and Estelle Parsons as his long-suffering wife, Althea.\nAfter the transformation, Jeff is met with shrieks of fear, open suspicion and hostility. If the film played America\u2019s inequalities for laughs, Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song was made in anger and defiance. Despite proving Van Peebles\u2019s box-office clout \u2013 Sweetback made more than $10m in 1971 \u2013 it lost him his deal with Columbia and won him a reputation as a volatile talent.\nBy then, Van Peebles had achieved success as a musician, for his albums of original, proto-rap material including Brer Soul (1968). He then turned his attention to Broadway, writing the music, book and lyrics for a \u201cghetto-life\u201d musical, Ain\u2019t Supposed to Die a Natural Death, which opened in October 1971 and ran for more than nine months. Before it closed, he opened another musical on Broadway, Don\u2019t Play Us Cheap! Its book received a Tony nomination and a film version came out in 1972. In 1974, he released a new album, What the \u2026 You Mean I Can\u2019t Sing?, its title reflecting his gruff humour and a progression in his vocal delivery from the spoken lyrics on previous releases.\nTen years passed before he released another album or film, but Van Peebles kept busy in the theatre. An autobiographical picaresque musical, Waltz of the Stork, opened in New York in 1982, with him as its star, and a couple of years later he directed a revamped puppet version of the show. The material was recycled into a 2008 film, Confessions of a Ex-Doofus Itchy-Footed Mutha, and a graphic novel.\nBy 1983, Van Peebles had developed his most unexpected role yet, moving from Broadway to Wall Street, and becoming a trader on the floor of the American stock exchange. In 1986, he wrote a book for aspiring investors, Bold Money: A New Way to Play the Options Market.\nMeanwhile, he returned to movies. He had a role in Robert Altman\u2019s OC and Stiggs (1985) and appeared with Mario in Jaws: The Revenge (1987), the TV series Sonny Spoon and the predominantly African-American western Posse (1993), which Mario directed.\nBack in 1971, Huey Newton had praised Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song and made it mandatory viewing for the Black Panthers. In 1995, Van Peebles adapted his own novel about the formation of Newton\u2019s radical party for the film Panther, directed by Mario. The following year, they made Gang in Blue, about racism within the police.\nIn 1998, Van Peebles wrote and narrated the documentary Classified X, an overview of black characters in American film. Routinely dubbed the godfather of black cinema \u2013 although he preferred \u201cgodfather of independent cinema\u201d \u2013 he increasingly appeared in documentaries, usually wearing his trademark round glasses and beret, chewing on a cigar. His projects became riffs on past achievements: he and Mario published a book about working together, No Identity Crisis (1990), and appeared in The Hebrew Hammer (2003), an irreverent Jewish take on blaxploitation.\nHe made another French production, Le Conte du Ventre Plein (Bellyful, 2000), released shortly after he was named a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. He also launched a musical-theatre version of Sweetback in France in 2010.\nHis son Mario cast him in small roles in Redemption Road (2010), We the Party (2012) and Armed (2018), and he also appeared in Tina Gordon\u2019s family comedy Peeples (2013).\nHis marriage to Maria ended in divorce in 2018. Megan died in 2006. He is survived by Mario and Max, another daughter, Marguerite, and 11 grandchildren.\n Melvin Van Peebles (Melvin Peebles), film-maker, novelist and musician, born 21 August 1932; died 21 September 2021",

We\u2019ve got 5 million people right now knocking on famine\u2019s door, we\u2019ve got 16 million people marching toward starvation.\u201d\nBeasley also told the UN general assembly that without further funding, the organisation will be forced to cut 3.2 million people\u2019s food rations by October, increasing to 5 million people by December.\nThe WFP\u2019s spokesperson for Yemen, Annabel Symington, said that Yemenis have been left unable to afford basic food supplies.\n\u201cThe causes of the hunger crisis in Yemen are complex, but the impact on Yemenis is clear. The devaluation of the Yemeni riyal and soaring food prices have made it impossible for ordinary Yemenis to afford basic foods,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe need $797m [\u00a3580m] to maintain current levels of assistance for the next six months and WFP is at risk of running out of food from October.\u201d\nAdam Kelwick, a humanitarian aid worker in Yemen for the NGO Action For Humanity, described the situation as \u201cdesperate\u201d.\nHe visited al-Sabaeen hospital, in the western city of Sana\u2019a, on Tuesday and said it was \u201cfull to the brink\u201d with starving, malnourished children.\n\u201cThey had to expand into other wards to accommodate all these children,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a horrific scene where there were beds full of children who looked like skeletons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to see the situation is rapidly deteriorating and the reason children are so severely malnourished is because their mothers are malnourished as well.\n\u201cObviously, that means they are unable to breastfeed their children and they end up in this terrible situation.\u201d\nHe said that even Yemeni families who are fortunate enough to have a source of income are facing the same food poverty.\n\u201cI spoke to one mother and although her family has employment and sources of income, it is very limited,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe had a small daughter called Hanan, who was 18 months old and weighed 5kg.\n\u201cShe said their money doesn\u2019t go anywhere any more. Prices for everything have increased.

        "content": "Soon to be seen as the father of Venus and Serena Williams in the Oscar-tipped King Richard, Smith has lent his everyman charm to comedies, sci-fi and even a buddy movie pairing a cop with an orc\nWill Smith has made many more than 20 films, but the economy of critical pain means this must always feature at the bottom of any list of any length. A horrifyingly cutesy, toxic dramedy with Smith as the tech entrepreneur, who loses his child to cancer and then starts writing impassioned letters to abstract concepts such as Death, Love and Time.\nThis romantic mystery weepie is guaranteed to make you break out in hives. Smith is a haunted, troubled, decent man; a government employee who has embarked on an enigmatic mission: to seek out good people \u2013 wheresoe\u2019er they be \u2013 and reward them. Why is he engaged on this supremely condescending quest? Who cares?\nA strong career strand for Smith is sci-fi (of which more later) but M Night Shyamalan was still in his phase of continuing awfulness when he directed this entirely terrible, ponderous sci-fi drama. Smith plays an astronaut of the future with the unfortunate name of Cypher, who crashes on the ruined and deserted planet Earth with his son, Kitai, played by Smith\u2019s son, Jaden. A reminder of what Sam Goldwyn once said to Albert Einstein: \u201cI got a theory of relatives, too: don\u2019t hire \u2019em.\u201d\nRobert Redford directed Smith in this sentimental slice of naively picturesque Americana set in the Jazz Age south. Matt Damon is a wealthy young golfer whose traumatised experiences in the first world war cause him to \u2013 gasp! \u2013 lose his love for golf. But the beamingly wise Bagger Vance, played by Smith, turns up as his caddy and guardian angel, the black character whose function is to facilitate the white hero\u2019s redemption.\nSmith took a critical and commercial bath at the end of the 90s with this steampunky western comedy-thriller. It is supremely annoying, but sometimes amusingly daft and Smith performs the catchy theme tune (sampling Stevie Wonder) over the closing credits. In the post Civil War US, he is sexy government agent James \u201cWild Wild\u201d West taking on Kenneth Branagh\u2019s evil genius Dr Loveless, who has access to 23rd-century technology.\nAs well as troubled emotional-journey-takers, Smith has played his share of romcom heroes-with-a-twist. Here is a ripe example. He is dating coach Alex \u201cHitch\u201d Hitchens who teaches lonely guys how to be a success with women; then he falls for gossip columnist Eva Mendes, who disdains him. His nickname adorably fuses the concept of \u201cgetting married\u201d with \u201cproblem\u201d, geddit?\nBack again to Smith sci-fi, and here is an offbeat, oddball comedy variant on the genre. He is Hancock, the smelly unshaven superhero that no one likes, who flies around irresponsibly, accidentally smashes up cars and buildings and annoys everyone. PR man Jason Bateman makes it his business to clean up Hancock\u2019s act and reposition him in the crime-fighting marketplace.\nHere\u2019s a sci-fi thriller with state-of-the-art youthification technology from director Ang Lee that maybe gestures at Smith\u2019s sense of his own mortality as an action hero. He is Brogan, a supercool special forces assassin who discovers that his corrupt government bosses have hired a gunman to whack him \u2013 and it\u2019s a creepy cloned version of his twentysomething self.\nSmith bulked up and toughened up for this hit sci-fi movie taken from the Isaac Asimov short story collection. The year is 2035 and Smith is playing troubled technophobic Chicago cop Del Spooner, who can\u2019t stand the robots that are increasingly being used by law-enforcement. And who can blame him, when one of these robots goes terrifyingly rogue? Sadly, there is something robotically bland about the whole film.\nSuicide Squad was the DC Extended Universe film that was never as bad as everyone said, and Smith made an amiable contribution as someone with both comedy and action chops. He is Floyd Lawton, or Deadshot, part of the Suicide Squad of supervillains assembled to fight other bad guys. Deadshot is the deadly hitman with the infrared scope over his eye. But he is a big softie when it comes to his infant daughter.\nIt\u2019s just so ridiculous you can\u2019t help smiling: a wacky fantasy action thriller in which Smith plays a tough LAPD officer whose partner is \u2026 an orc, played by Joel Edgerton in heavy makeup. Yes. In this alternative universe, these Tolkienian creatures walk among us, subject to racism (there is an \u201cOrc Lives Matter\u201d theme), and Smith and the orc have a lot of \u201codd couple buddy cop\u201c energy. There are also wicked elves, nice elves and centaur traffic cops.\nIn 1995, producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer gave us what is arguably the last of the big guilty-pleasure dumb action comedy-thriller franchises, teaming Smith with that lost superstar of bad-taste comedy Martin Lawrence as two squabbling Miami cops, Smith being the cool single ladies\u2019 man and Lawrence the harassed husband and father. In the micro-ranking, the overlong and boorish sequel Bad Boys II (2003) comes in last, while the threequel, Bad Boys for Life (2020) acknowledges the passing years. But the original Bad Boys (1995) is the best, with the outrageous action standbys of guns, car-chases and smart-alec tag lines.\nSmith made a very likable lead in this decent and watchable conspiracy thriller, a little like The Firm directed by Tony Scott and pairing Smith with Gene Hackman. Smith is the ambitious young lawyer who accidentally comes into possession of a video showing an outspoken congressman being murdered \u2013 and then he is framed by shadowy forces, losing his job and his marriage. Then the maverick intelligence officer played by Hackman steps in, a man who loathes government corruption and in an \u201codd couple\u201d way helps the decent Smith.\nThis dystopian sci-fi, based on the Richard Matheson novel (and already filmed as The Omega Man in 1971 with Charlton Heston) got a new version in 2007, starring Smith playing the last man left alive in an eerily empty, ruined Manhattan, an urban jungle with zoo-bred animals roaming around. The movie plays to Smith\u2019s strengths as the good-natured everyman hero under unimaginable pressure.\nJust for once, Smith stars in a heartwarmer that isn\u2019t absolutely sickening, making this unfashionable movie genre actually seem pretty decent. This is the Horatio Alger-type true story of American businessman Chris Gardner who experienced hardship and homelessness on his way to the top. Smith plays him as a regular guy with idealism and high standards, a single dad who finds himself tipping into poverty and fights his way out.\nThe clunking 2016 sequel to this film is now known chiefly for Boris Johnson using it as a pro-Brexit rallying cry, but the original is a very enjoyable, brash piece of entertainment: an alien invasion disaster movie that featured the (almost shocking) spectacle of the White House getting zapped. Jeff Goldblum was the quirky computer genius, Bill Pullman played one of the many quasi-Bill-Clinton US presidents of that era. But Smith stole the show as the swaggering hotshot fighter pilot who takes on the creepy invaders.\nWith care, gravitas and charm, Smith gave a very good impersonation of Muhammad Ali in Michael Mann\u2019s virile biopic, taking us from the boxer\u2019s defeat of Sonny Liston in 1964, through to his conscientious stand against the Vietnam draft and the \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d against George Foreman in the next decade. It is a strong and heartfelt performance, a rare and perhaps unique example of Smith being really technically challenged as an actor.\nMany were nervous at the thought of Smith taking over from Robin Williams as the genie for the Disney live-action remake of Aladdin in 2019; others were uneasy at the potential for all sorts of tone-deaf orientalist offence. But, actually, Smith\u2019s signature goofy charm is allowed to flourish in this likably zany, high-energy comedy in which Smith is allowed to steal every scene he\u2019s in. A reminder that comedy was his original vocation.\nSmith and (initially) Tommy Lee Jones are the two government agents dressed in black, the sci-fi version of the Blues Brothers, and their job is to combat aliens while covering up evidence of their existence, erasing witnesses\u2019 memories with a special wand. The place of shame is occupied by the dismal fourquel Men in Black: International (2019) in which the thrill had gone; next is the low-morale immediate follow-up Men in Black II (2002); oddly, Men in Black 3(2012) was rather better with Josh Brolin pepping things up. But the original and best is Men in Black (1997) in which Smith was in his box-office golden age as the funny, wacky, charismatic Hollywood lead.\n\n Smith was hardly out of his Fresh Prince career phase when he scored his most substantial and satisfying success in director Fred Schepisi\u2019s filmed version of the John Guare play. Smith plays a charming Mr Ripley figure, a young man who cons his way into the lives of two wealthy high-society types, played by Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland, claiming to be the son of Sidney Poitier, so cunningly and tacitly playing on their liberal white guilt about race. Smith is charismatic and unsettling; it is still his masterpiece.",

We\u2019d love it. It\u2019s a reputation for them; it\u2019s a reputation for us. So surely [Unesco] need to have an 11th-hour think about these things,\u201d he said.\nLiverpool became only the third place in nearly 50 years to lose its world heritage status when Unesco concluded that years of development had led to an \u201cirreversible loss\u201d to the historical value of its Victorian docks.\nThe UN agency said developments such as Liverpool Waters, a \u00a35.5bn Peel Group project, had led to a \u201cserious deterioration\u201d of the area\u2019s outstanding universal value along with \u201csignificant loss to its authenticity and integrity\u201d.\nSmith criticised the decision as \u201cnaive\u201d and said it was \u201cunfair\u201d of Unesco to judge Liverpool\u2019s world heritage site by the same criteria as other cultural treasures that do not face the same challenges as major cities.\nHe said the move had not dented Liverpool\u2019s \u201cstaggeringly good\u201d cultural appeal and that losing its international title had \u201cno impact at all\u201d on visitor numbers. The occupancy level of city centre hotels was 81% in August, the highest since October 2019, according to the council, with nearly as many rooms sold this summer as in the previous eight months.\nSmith, who previously managed the Grade I-listed St George\u2019s Hall and Liverpool town hall, said that \u201cno labels are needed because we don\u2019t need to know how good we are as a city\u201d.\nDespite the bullish approach, however, he admitted that the city was considering making a scaled-down effort to place the Three Graces and St George\u2019s Hall on Unesco\u2019s world heritage list.\nThe four buildings \u2013 nicknamed \u201cthe fab four\u201d by some \u2013 were part of the original world heritage site but were not specifically singled out for criticism during nearly 10 years of sometimes-fractious talks with Unesco heritage officers.\nThe Three Graces is the name given to the trio of historic structures that line Liverpool\u2019s Pier Head waterfront \u2013 the Royal Liver building, Cunard building and Port of Liverpool building \u2013 which were built between 1904 and 1917 as a sign of the city\u2019s international prestige as a major trading port.\nSmith said talks about submitting a fresh application were under way. It is understood that Historic England and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport have not yet been approached by Liverpool about such an application but that they would if one went ahead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to Unesco if they want us to be a red line through their list of beautiful sites across the world. Personally I would look to arbitrate; they should come back and take our offer and reduce [the size of the site] down,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf it was down to me, I\u2019d do the Three Graces and St George\u2019s Hall \u2013 they\u2019re world-renowned \u2013 but we need to consult within our team [and] within our city.

It estimates that it will save EU consumers \u20ac250m (\u00a3214m) a year.\nThe directive will impose the use of USB-C ports, currently used by Android phones, for all devices. It would force Apple devices, which use lightning cables, to provide USB-C ports on its devices in EU countries.\nOnce the law comes into force there will be a transitional period of two years during which manufacturers must switch their devices to the common standard.\nApple has objected. In a statement it said: \u201cWe remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world.\u201d\nIt also expressed concerns about the two-year transition period for companies to comply.\nThe commission vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, defended the plan. She said: \u201cWe gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.\u201d\nThe current system allows Apple to use \u201cproprietary charging interfaces\u201d. The new directive complains that this prevents full interoperability. It says it also ignores the \u201cenvironmental issues arising from the continued existence of those different charging interfaces.\u201d\nThe directive says Apple\u2019s \u201cproprietary solutions\u201d are \u201cno longer justified in view of the technical advantages provided by the introduction of the USB-C interface\u201d.\nWithout mentioning Apple by name, it makes clear that the company has resisted the change. It says: \u201cThose manufacturers that have invested heavily in proprietary charging technology appear less keen, since the high charging performance of their bundled phones and EPS [external power supply] is an important part of their marketing strategy.\u201d\nIt adds: \u201cThis directive aims to reduce the e-waste generated by the sale of radio equipment and to reduce the extraction of raw materials and the CO2 emissions generated by the production, transportation and disposal of chargers, thereby promoting a circular economy.\u201d\nHalf the chargers sold with mobile phones in 2018 had a USB micro-B connector, while 29% had a USB-C connector and 21% a lightning connector, according to a 2019 Commission study.",

But the animals are becoming more brazen.\nLast week wild boar mingled among parents as they waited to collect their children from a school in the Monte Mario district. The animals were also recently photographed outside Italy\u2019s foreign ministry while some residents have reported being followed by boar as they put out the rubbish.\nIn May, a group of hungry boar surrounded a woman in the car park of a supermarket in Formello, a town outside Rome, before stealing her shopping bags and eating the contents.\nVirginia Raggi, a politician with the Five Star Movement, is hoping to win a second term as mayor, despite frequently coming under attack over the city\u2019s management.\nShe blames leaders of the surrounding Lazio region for what she described as \u201cthe massive and uncontrolled presence of wild boar in Italy\u2019s capital\u201d and recently began legal proceedings against the regional authority over the matter.\nAs her political opponents seized on the latest sighting of boar, she said: \u201cMy detractors continue to use photos and videos of wild boar around Rome, giving me full responsibility.\n\u201cIt is clear that wild boar are a problem that does not only concern the capital. If a lady is chased by a wild boar in Formello, a small town north of Rome, the next day the newspapers say I am responsible.\u201d\nRaggi pointed out that Formello was led by a mayor from the far-right League party.\nRome residents have long lamented the city\u2019s degrado (decay), from the rubbish-strewn streets and scrappy parks to the potholes and historic buildings scarred by graffiti. But while there was some improvement in Rome\u2019s upkeep during the pandemic, the old woes returned to the fore as the city became busier.\nRaggi was elected mayor in June 2016 on the promise of resolving all the deeply entrenched issues and making Rome \u201cliveable again\u201d.\nPolls this week placed her in third place among four contenders. Enrico Michetti, a politician with the far-right Brothers of Italy, is leading in the polls, followed by Roberto Gualtieri, from the centre-left Democratic party. Carlo Calenda, who leads Azione, described as a liberal centrist party, is in fourth place.\nWith neither candidate expected to win more than 50% of votes in the first round, two will go on to compete in a second ballot on 13 October. During a debate between the candidates on Wednesday, Gualtieri pledged to order \u201can extraordinary clean-up\u201d of Rome, while Calenda promised to spend \u20ac38m \u201cto clean the pavements, remove graffiti from the walls, clear the drains and clean-up around the rubbish bins\u201d.\nRaggi claimed on Wednesday that she had overtaken Gualtieri in the polls and would therefore go on to fend off the far-right in the second round, although this claim has been disputed. \u201cThe reality is that the mayor has not overtaken Gualtieri in the polls,\u201d said Beatrice Lorenzin, a Democratic party politician.",

Nurses, care home staff and other health and social care workers will pay an additional \u00a3900m in tax, according to the analysis.\nThe figures do not include those working in the NHS or care who are self-employed, meaning the real impact is likely to be even greater.\nMillions of health and care workers are already facing a squeeze on their finances. A combination of rising energy and consumer goods prices, coupled with benefits cuts, are adding hundreds of pounds in costs for households, charities have warned.\nThe Bank of England said on Thursday that inflation was expected to rise in the short term, projecting it would move \u201cslightly above 4%\u201d in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Liberal Democrats, which commissioned the analysis, said the findings exposed the fact the government was launching a \u201ctax raid on NHS and care home heroes\u201d who are still risking their lives on the frontline of the pandemic.\nA nurse or midwife on an average salary will see their tax bill soar by \u00a3310, care home workers will have to pay at least \u00a3140 more and ambulance staff will be hit with a \u00a3420 increase. On average, 1.4 million NHS staff will each have to fork out \u00a3315 more a year, the Commons library report says.\nMunira Wilson MP, the Liberal Democrats health spokesperson, said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s broken manifesto promise amounts to a \u00a3900m tax raid on our NHS and care home heroes.\n\u201cThese are the nurses, ambulance drivers and care workers who worked day in day out to save lives on the frontline of the pandemic. Now their reward is to be hit with a tax bill worth hundreds of pounds, at a time when incomes are being squeezed by the cost of living crisis.\n\u201cThe Conservatives must rethink this unjust tax hike that will disproportionately impact those on low and middle incomes. Their plans risk worsening the staffing crisis in our care homes instead of fixing it.\u201d\nChristina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, Britain\u2019s biggest health union, said that punishing key workers with the national insurance rise was a terrible way to treat those \u201cwho\u2019ve done so much to care for people and save lives these past 18 months\u201d.\n\u201cInflation has bypassed the NHS pay rise,\u201d she said. \u201cMost care employees have had nothing at all. The harsh universal credit snatch has yet to take effect. And these same key workers will be paying through the nose when the [national insurance contributions] increase hits.\u201d\nMcAnea said the NHS and social care sector could see thousands quit as a result. \u201cNo one could blame care and NHS staff for jumping ship for more lucrative, less stressful jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the consequences of losing thousands of experienced workers simply do not bear thinking about.\u201d\nResponding to the Commons library analysis, the Royal College of Nursing council chair, Carol Popplestone, said: \u201cReaching primarily into the pockets of our hardworking healthcare workers who already feel taken for granted, which could lead more to the exit, is the opposite of levelling up.\n\u201cThe prime minister needs to come up with a credible plan to make up for years of underinvestment and put money into the services patients will rely on for years to come, and the people who provide them.\u201d\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe health and social care levy will raise \u00a312bn a year for the NHS and social care. Everyone is being asked to contribute, in a fair and progressive way.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve supported social care workers throughout the pandemic. The lowest paid have benefitted from our increase to the national living wage, and we\u2019re investing half a billion pounds to deliver training and support for adult social care workers as part of the package announced this month.\u201d",

        "content": "Sterling, Silva and Stones are among recent victims of a policy that has backfired against Chelsea before and may do again\nRodri, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, John Stones, Aymeric Laporte, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva: the Manchester City A-list acts recently dropped by Pep Guardiola for culpabilities (apparently) unknown.\nThis is the savant manager\u2019s intriguing idiosyncrasy: an enigmatic bent for removing star turns from the XI that can cause bafflement and that yields mixed results. Now, as City play Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool (all away) in a pivotal eight-day sequence that starts at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Rodri, Cancelo, Laporte and Silva are back in favour (for the moment), while Stones and Sterling remain exiled.\nRodri and Cancelo are listed first above because they were victims of the Guardiola axe for the biggest game in the club\u2019s history \u2013 and their careers: May\u2019s Champions League final. And because City disappointed, losing 1-0 to Chelsea. And because they were overrun in midfield where Rodri, Guardiola\u2019s first-choice holding operator, would usually stymie attacks. And because Chelsea\u2019s winner came via Kai Havertz, who was allowed to float on to Mason Mount\u2019s ball by Oleksandr Zinchenko whose concentration was errant as the left-back \u2013 Cancelo\u2019s usual berth \u2013 failed to cover across.\nNow, at Chelsea, for the first meeting since the loss at Estadio do Drag\u00e3o, Stones, if available, waits to discover if he remains a Guardiola footballer non grata or if he will benefit from the manager\u2019s selection vagaries. When dropped a couple of seasons ago the reason was clear: a drastic decline of form that forced Guardiola\u2019s hand, and which had Stones a favourite for the Etihad exit door. Last term came recall and redemption, his central defensive partnership with R\u00faben Dias key in the title triumph, and the Portuguese defender winning the Football Writers Player of the Year award. Stones, like Dias (and Cancelo), was voted into the Professional Footballers Association Team of the Year and performed admirably in England\u2019s run to the Euro 2020 final. But now he is excluded again.\nThe Barnsley boy\u2019s extended summer break \u2013 plus a leg injury \u2013 were Guardiola\u2019s initial cited reasons. But after the Catalan cleared Stones to join up with England \u2013 he started two of his country\u2019s three games in early September \u2013 on return the 27-year-old was unable to dislodge Laporte for City\u2019s win at Leicester the following weekend. Stones was on the bench while the Spain international started, and though each missed last Saturday\u2019s 0-0 draw with Southampton due to injury, Laporte \u2013 who remains a doubt for Chelsea \u2013 possesses the shirt.\nAt the moment, that should say. Because the reason Stones is out of the XI seems as mysterious as Laporte\u2019s own demotion last term when he went from the alpha defender in City\u2019s title triumph of 2018-19, and the following year\u2019s failed defence, to bench-warmer. Laporte lost his place after November\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Tottenham, remained in the cold for the rest of the campaign, but is suddenly an automatic choice again.\nGuardiola is fond of positing how if a manager shuffles his pack and the team wins he is a genius; if not he is \u201ckilled\u201d. There is a logic here \u2013 all any No 1 can do is trust a footballer to perform. Yet what is a manager of Guardiola\u2019s quality paid for if not to make the right selection calls when they truly matter? If City\u2019s petro-buck does not stop with him, why is he employed?\nIn Porto he got it wrong. Before the May showpiece Cancelo had offered a season-long exhibition of total Pep-left-back play. Here, think Philipp Lahm under Guardiola at Bayern Munich, as the Portuguese emulated the German in a roving infield schemer role whose passing created havoc, and goals.\nExcept for against Chelsea. Cancelo was dropped for the less talented Zinchenko, and Rodri, who had been as essential, was out too. The latter was the new Fernandinho \u2013 not as combative, and lacking his penchant for technical fouls, but a silky operator as the shield, who purred forward to join attacks in Rolls Royce mode. Of the 1,080 available minutes in City\u2019s 12-game run to the final Rodri played 785 in 10 of these. Cancelo\u2019s number was 604 in nine, while in the Premier League the former\u2019s count was 34 of the 38 games for 2,747, the latter\u2019s 28 for 2,302.\nCue each being bench-warmers as the manager went for all-out attack and, in a comical irony, Sterling, like Laporte-for-Stones this season, found himself on the right end of Guardiola\u2019s fiddling as he was (bafflingly) reinstated after being (surprisingly) dropped two months before.\nLast week Guardiola indicated Sterling, who has started only two league games this season, has fallen beneath \u201cthe standards\u201d England\u2019s standout Euro 2020 act previously set. The forward found himself in the wilderness when benched for a 5-2 victory over Southampton in mid-March, following a run of five goals in seven outings that ended four games earlier: hardly a dramatic fall-off in numbers and form.\nYet from there Sterling started five of the last nine league matches with three coming after the title was claimed, so was trusted for only two of six \u201clive\u201d games. And he failed to start any of the Champions League quarter-final and semi-final legs before being reinstated for the showpiece, lasting 77 minutes before Guardiola, perhaps regretting the decision, hooked him.\nSilva has experienced as confusing a ride. Flying high as Guardiola\u2019s \u201cbest \u2013 not just in our team\u201d of 2018-19, when the Portuguese made 31 league starts, the next two seasons he was granted only 23 and 24. Silva\u2019s selection in Porto was as much a head-scratcher as Sterling\u2019s, and he was off after 64 minutes, Guardiola finally deciding a defensive midfielder was required \u2013 and turning to Fernandinho, not Rodri.\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s 6-1 Carabao Cup rout of Wycombe, in which he handed debuts to five teenagers (who were all 18 or 17), Guardiola offered a clue regarding his quirky selection policy. \u201cWhen you become old and win Premier Leagues and FA Cups, the concentration decreases a bit and the manager has to push them,\u201d the Catalan said. Yet after making Sterling and Silva fringe players to \u201cpush\u201d them, on being brought back for the Champions League final they were part of City\u2019s failure.\nGuardiola has lost eight times as a manager against Chelsea and now plots to stop them on Saturday from becoming the first team to hand one of his sides four consecutive reverses. He is bound to tinker when doing so.",

        "content": "If a judge does not intervene by 30 September, those selected for the program will become ineligible: \u2018We are left behind\u2019\nThousands of Afghan families who were selected for US visas are stuck in the war-torn country, as the US government\u2019s failure to schedule their visa interviews ahead of a final deadline puts them at risk of missing their opportunity to leave.\nIf a US judge does not intervene by 30 September, more than 2,100 Afghans who were selected for the diversity visa program last year will become ineligible for such a visa.\nThe program annually awards green cards through a lottery to applicants from countries with lower immigration rates. The US state department is responsible for interviewing winners and granting visas by 30 September, the end of the fiscal year, but due to a suspension of the program and large backlogs during the pandemic, the US embassy in Kabul did not conduct interviews in the months leading up to the US withdrawal. When the embassy shut down in August, the lottery winners were left with virtually no pathway to get their cases approved.\nSome Afghan families have sued the Biden administration in hopes of extending the deadline beyond September. In the meantime, some applicants say they face grave danger as the security situation in the country has deteriorated. Others are growing increasingly desperate over what lies ahead for their families under Taliban rule.\n\u201c[It feels as if] no one cares about us, and every day [the situation] is getting worse,\u201d said Abdul, a 34-year-old father of two, in a phone interview from Kabul. (The Guardian is withholding last names out of security concerns.)\nAbdul was selected for a diversity visa in June 2020, but never got invited for an interview. He said his hope to make it to the US was diminishing in the final week before the deadline. \u201cWe are left behind.\u201d\nThe visa lottery program, which was established in 1990, offers a pathway to the US that is separate from other visa programs that are based on family sponsorship and employment. It has minimal eligibility requirements (high school education or two years work experience) and attracts millions of applicants across the world.\nLast year, 60,000 Afghans entered the lottery, which globally gives out up to 55,000 green cards each year. Of the Afghan applicants for the 2020-21 fiscal year, 2,189 were selected.\nSelected candidates aren\u2019t guaranteed a visa \u2013 applicants need to pass security screenings and an interview \u2013 but Afghans who made the draw said it felt akin to winning a million-dollar lottery.\n\u201cI felt like God had given me the chance I needed,\u201d said Abdul.\nOne of Abdul\u2019s children, his four-year-old son, has autism and there are few services available for him in his home country, he said. Moving to the US would allow his son to get the support he needed, he said: \u201cMy dream is to come to America for my baby.\u201d\nAbdul was previously employed by a logistics and supply company that worked with the US government. In 2016, he had applied for a special visa based on his service for the US and the dangers he faced as a result. The US embassy decided that he qualified, records show, but later denied him a visa, claiming he didn\u2019t have enough supporting documents. Learning his name was drawn in the diversity lottery presented an unexpected glimmer of hope, he said.\n\u201cI helped [the US government], and I want them to save my family\u2019s life,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cNow, I have no hope for my life anymore, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nMaryam, 30, who has two children, ages five and six, said winning the lottery last year was \u201clike a dream come true\u201d. \u201cI knew that this is the best country for our children. I want to guarantee a better life for them.\u201d She had applied several times before.\nIn a call from a city in northern Afghanistan, speaking Farsi through a translator, she said she would often lie awake imagining her life in the US. Maryam\u2019s family are Shia, a religious minority that has been a target of violent attacks by the Islamic State in recent years, and she said she has family in California. After the Taliban takeover, her family was displaced from their home, she said. She sent the Guardian photos of her children sleeping in a stairwell where she said they are temporarily living.\nLottery winners from a wide range of backgrounds \u2013 journalists, former government workers, medical professionals, students, consultants \u2013 told the Guardian over the past week that they felt their future in the country had dimmed since the Taliban takeover and that they\u2019ve never felt as uncertain about their prospects of making it out.\nThe trouble for visa applicants, however, did not begin with this summer\u2019s turmoil, but started last year when the Trump administration took aggressive steps to halt immigration to the US.\nFrom the start of his presidency, Trump worked to dismantle longstanding mechanisms of legal admission to the US, including the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries and repeated attempts to shut down the visa lottery.\nThe pandemic brought about an opportunity. Visa applications slowed as embassies were forced to close their doors due to Covid-19 concerns. Meanwhile, Trump, claiming he was protecting American jobs and stopping the spread of the virus, also issued an order to freeze diversity visas.\nOn 31 August 2020, Maryam received an email from a US consular center that said: \u201cCongratulations! Our records indicate that you have submitted all documentation required \u2026 and are ready to be scheduled for an interview.\u201d The next paragraph said: \u201cInterviews for the DV 2020 program are currently suspended,\u201d adding that all interviews \u201cmust be concluded by September 30, 2021\u201d.\n\u201cWe did everything that was required. The last part we needed was the interview,\u201d she said.\nLawsuits brought by lottery winners from around the world forced the US to resume the program last September, with a judge ruling that the administration could not \u201ceffectively extinguish the diversity program\u201d by letting all pending cases expire.\nBut when the program restarted, US embassies and consulates began to process applicants from the previous year, and amid significant backlogs, did not move forward with 2021 cases. \u201cYou can do a lot of damage by creating these long lines and making the system just completely nonfunctional,\u201d said Carly Goodman, an immigration historian writing a book on the lottery.\nThe impact was severe in Afghanistan, where residents were bracing for the US withdrawal.\nLawyers representing lottery winners said that even after the Biden administration took over after Trump\u2019s election defeat, visa lottery hopefuls didn\u2019t get interviews and the embassy instead prioritized Afghans who had worked with the US military.\nUS statistics show that Kabul did not process a single diversity visa application through the end of July, the latest available data.\nSince the rushed evacuations, which also left behind many Afghans who had worked for the US and other vulnerable members of civil society, the diversity visa candidates\u2019 hope of an interview have largely vanished.\n\u201cI keep emailing, but they\u2019re not responding,\u201d said Mohammad, a 22-year-old student at the American University of Afghanistan, who won the lottery last year. He fears if the new regime discovers he was affiliated with the university, which recently shut down, he could be killed. Some of his classmates were evacuated, but he didn\u2019t make it out: \u201cI have no life left here,\u201d he said.\nRafael Ure\u00f1a, an immigration attorney representing 40 Afghans in a lawsuit against the US over diversity visas, said that with the US embassy in Kabul closed, US officials have not designated a specific post in a third country where Afghan applicants could be interviewed instead. Records show a lawyer for the state department suggested to Ure\u00f1a\u2019s office that it would schedule interviews only for Afghans who were already in third countries.\nThe US embassy in Islamabad recently emailed one of Ure\u00f1a\u2019s clients to say it could not approve a transfer request unless applicants were living in Pakistan, adding: \u201cWe have not been designated a processing post for immigrant or diversity visas for Afghans.\u201d\nA state department spokesperson told the Guardian that if Afghans can travel to a processing post outside the country, they can request a case transfer, but added, \u201cWe recognize it is currently extremely difficult for Afghans to obtain a visa to a third country or find a way to enter a third country.\u201d\nThe state department was \u201cdeveloping processing alternatives so that we can continue to deliver this important service for the people of Afghanistan\u201d, the spokesperson said, but added that it was unable to process visas in a country that no longer had an embassy.\n\u201cThe department made every effort to process as many diversity visa cases as possible, consistent with other priorities, despite the severe operational constraints and backlog resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the statement said.\nUre\u00f1a said the state department under both administrations has abdicated its duty to adjudicate diversity visa applications.\nHe added: \u201cBiden campaigned on this idea that the Trump administration was acting unlawfully and treating immigrants badly, but when his administration has an opportunity to make things right, they refuse.\u201d\nUre\u00f1a is hoping that the federal judge in his case, who last year restarted diversity visas, will order the US to in effect preserve his plaintiffs\u2019 visas beyond 30 September. A hearing is scheduled for 27 September, but even if a judge extends the process, it will probably apply only to the 40 plaintiffs who have joined the case.\nMohammad, a 28-year-old diversity lottery winner, has emailed senators, Congress members and others in the US requesting help to be evacuated and to have his and other lottery winners\u2019 applications processed elsewhere. Some staffers have forwarded his requests to the state department, but he has heard nothing further.\n\u201cWe have less than 10 days, and we don\u2019t know what our situation will be after that,\u201d he said.\nTawfeequllah, a 30-year-old lottery winner who has three daughters, said he can\u2019t get a visa to go to another country for an interview and has few options left.\nAsked what message he would want to send to the state department, Tawfeequllah said, \u201cPlease help us, please help us, please help us.\u201d",

        "content": "Coast has already heated up by 2C over the past century, thanks in part to warming Atlantic Ocean\nThe coastal US north-east is one of the fastest warming areas in the northern hemisphere, having heated up rapidly by 2C (3.6F) already over the past century due in part to the soaring temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean, new research has found.\nThe coastline that stretches from Maine down to Delaware hosts urban areas such as New York City and Boston and draws millions of tourists each year to beaches and other attractions. But the region is rapidly changing due to the climate crisis, having heated up by 2C on average since the start of the 20th century, driven largely by much warmer summers.\nThis is one of the fastest temperature increases in the northern hemisphere, researchers found, and is double the level of heating that has taken place further inland in the same region.\nThe world\u2019s governments have agreed to limit the overall global temperature rise to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C to avoid disastrous heatwaves, floods and other impacts. The US north-east has itself now, in isolation, already breached this threshold.\n\u201cIt really pops out, it\u2019s a big jump in temperature,\u201d said Ambarish Karmalkar, a climate scientist at University of Massachusetts Amherst and lead author of the paper, published in Nature Climate Change. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional level of warming and what is surprising to me is that it\u2019s so different within a small region. The interior of the US north-east has only warmed by 1C, whereas these popular coastal areas have warmed by 2C. That\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\nKarmalkar and his colleague Radley Horton sought to establish the reasons for this brisk temperature increase and have pointed to a link between the rising heat of the northern Atlantic Ocean and that of the nearby land.\nA large system of ocean currents, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (or Amoc), acts as a sort of conveyor belt for the ocean, bringing warm, salty water from the tropics north towards Greenland, where it cools and sinks.\nRecent studies indicate that this watery conveyor is slowing down as the climate heats up, meaning that warmer water is piling up along the US east coast, in places such as the Gulf of Maine and the Mid-Atlantic Bight. This warming, which is upending traditional fisheries as marine ecosystems morph, has helped drive up temperatures along the coast with the aid of altered wind patterns, according to the researchers.\n\u201cThe sea surface temperatures have gone up dramatically, much faster than the global average, and more heat is being dumped there by the slowing conveyor belt,\u201d said Karmalkar. \u201cYou are also getting these anomalous winds, and these two factors together are driving warming trends.\u201d\nCities in the US north-east have been primarily focused on the dangers of flooding wreaked by the climate crisis \u2013 record rainfall caused severe flash flooding that killed dozens of people in New York earlier this month \u2013 but Karmalkar said that authorities would increasingly have to focus upon rising heat if current trends continue.\n\u201cThe exceptional warming we\u2019ve seen can have serious implications for heat stress and human health,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people vacation on this coast but the warming may change how people use the space. This will become an important public health issue to deal with.\u201d\nBob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who was not involved in the research, said the study \u201cnicely identifies\u201d possible causes for the heating of the US north-east. Kopp added that adaptations to this heat would have to take place.\n\u201cOf course, there are huge inequities within the United States, and within the region the harms of extreme heat will tend to be felt most heavily by lower-income people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is also a densely urbanized area, with a substantial urban heat island effect.\u201d\nScientists have warned that countries are still not cutting planet-heating emissions quickly enough to avoid catastrophic consequences, with places from the US west to Germany to China already experiencing recent severe climate crisis-fueled impacts. \u201cThese changes will only become worse if humans continue to emit carbon dioxide,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University.",

        "content": "Westminister\u2019s bilateral aid axe falls heavily on education, gender and equality\nDetails of the cuts of more than 40% in the UK bilateral aid spending programme have been set out by the Foreign Office for the first time, including huge cuts to humanitarian aid, girls\u2019 equality and climate.\nIt is the first time the government has outlined how the aid axe is intended to fall in 2021 as ministers cut the aid programme from 0.7% of UK gross national income to 0.5%, a decision now endorsed in a vote by MPs, but not peers, and likely to remain in force for many years.\nMinisters say the UK aid programme will remain the third largest in the world, and the cuts were forced on the government by the scale of the hit to the economy caused by Covid.\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office also says the figures on overseas development assistance, revealed in an annexe to the department\u2019s annual report and accounts published this week, are projections, and extra funding may be made available if need arises. Aid to Afghanistan, for instance, has been doubled in recent weeks due to the Taliban capture of the country and the resulting humanitarian disaster.\nBut the previous foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, was frequently accused of failing to spell out the real implications of the cuts, focusing instead on continuing government priority areas.\nThe cuts also show that east Africa, once seen as a priority by the UK, has suffered severely, as have humanitarian disaster areas such as Yemen and Syria in the Middle East, and Pakistan.\nProgramme cuts include Ethiopia, down from \u00a3240m in 2020-21 to a budget of \u00a3107.5m in 2021-22. Somalia\u2019s aid has been slashed from \u00a3121m to \u00a371.2m, while South Sudan\u2019s aid fall from \u00a3135.4m to \u00a368.4m. Tanzania is projected to drop from \u00a389.1m to \u00a328.5m.\nOverall the level of aid in the east and central Africa region is being reduced from \u00a31.1bn to \u00a3545.9m.\nSarah Champion, the chair of the international development committee \u2013 which scrutinises UK aid, called the cuts to the east Africa region \u201coutrageous and hypocritical\u201d.\nIn west Africa aid is being cut from \u00a3708.9m to \u00a3345.2m, with aid to the Democratic Republic of the Congo falling from \u00a3121m to \u00a356m, and Nigeria from \u00a3209m to \u00a395m. The joint Sahel department will face a cut from \u00a361.4m to \u00a323.8m.\nCuts in aid to Pakistan and Bangladesh mean the level of UK spending in India and the Indian Ocean region falls from \u00a3358.6m to \u00a3201.6m. UK aid to Bangladesh drops from \u00a3189.8m to \u00a372.6m, while in Pakistan, aid falls from \u00a3159m to \u00a397.6.\nBudget cuts in the Indo-Pacific, the UK\u2019s new priority area, are minimal, although Myanmar faces a reduction in aid from \u00a391.9m to \u00a349.5m.\nA former priority area for the UK, aid to parts of the Middle East has been slashed. Aid to Lebanon falls from \u00a384.9m to \u00a313.1m, Syria down from \u00a3153.5m to \u00a348m while Yemen faces a drop from \u00a3220.5m to \u00a382.4m. The occupied Palestinian territories see a cut from \u00a379.9m to \u00a326.9m.\nIn terms of cuts by theme, the accounts suggest overall humanitarian aid will be reduced from \u00a3546m to \u00a3278m; education, gender and equalities budgets face a cut of \u00a3308.8m to \u00a3124.3m and, despite Covid, health sees a reduction from \u00a31.158bn to \u00a3915m. Climate is cut from \u00a3330m to \u00a3214m. There is a small increase in aid to the World Health Organization, but cuts to the Asian Development Bank.\nThe total level of aid budget in 2020 was \u00a314.4bn of which \u00a39bn was classified as bilateral aid.\nThe report reveals that the Foreign Office has cut its aid spend to China by 95% to \u00a30.9m, targeted on specific programmes that promote British values of open societies and human rights. No money is given directly to the government. A significant proportion of 2020-21 programme spend in China was on former cross-Whitehall Prosperity Fund programmes, which have been reflected in the Prosperity Fund section of the annexe.\nThe accounts also reveal that the Foreign Office has assets valued at \u00a312.5m still tied up in Afghanistan to which it does not have access.\nThe cuts do not take into account reductions enforced in 2019 owing to a shrinkage in the size of the economy, but the scale of those cuts appear to have been smaller than at one time projected.\nThe Treasury has ruled that the 0.7% target will not be restored until debt is falling and there is no deficit in day-to-day spending. That assessment will be made by the Office for Budget Responsibility.",

The 19th-century American writer Mark Twain used a mixture of French and English in his book The Innocents Abroad for comedic effect. In the trenches during the first world war, English-speaking troops evolved \u201cTommy French\u201d.\nIt was really popularised by the French academic, novelist and critic Ren\u00e9 \u00c9tiemble, in his denunciation of the overuse of English words in French, Parlez-vous franglais?, in 1964.\nBut it was from the 1970s onwards that it really entered popular culture in the UK. The PG Tips tea company advertised their wares with a cycling chimp competing in the Tour de France and the catchphrase \u201cAvez-vous un cuppa\u201d. Another fictional practitioner was Miss Piggy, a character in the Muppet Show, whose glamour was underscored with her overuse of \u201cmoi\u201d and \u201cmon petit cheri\u201d.\nIn the UK, the satirist and columnist Miles Kington began writing his \u201cFranglais\u201d columns \u2013 a comical mixture of English and French \u2013 in Punch magazine, later published as a series of books entitled \u201cLet\u2019s Parler Franglais!\u201d. After he died in 2008, the BBC headlined its obituary: \u201cAu revoir Mister Franglais.\u201d\nThe 1975 hit film Monty Python and the Holy Grail saw French castle guard John Cleese order his troops to \u201cfetchez la vache\u201d, to their initial bemusement, before they fetched and catapulted a cow at the Britons. And the 1981 hit by Rolling Stone Bill Wyman, (Si Si) Je suis un rock star, was an absolute masterclass in the art of franglais, with lines including \u201cJe habiter la a la south of France, voulez vous partir with me?\u201d and \u201ccome and rester le with me in France\u201d.\nFranglais has seen \u201cle soccer\u201d, \u201cle hotdog\u201d and \u201cle weekend\u201d gain traction, with the latter reportedly particularly irritating to French purists. In 2013 there was a famous ban \u2013 by French governmental decree \u2013 of the word \u201chashtag\u201d, replacing it with the French equivalent \u201cmot-diese\u201d.\nPerhaps the best \u2013 or least proficient \u2013 exponent of the craft was the character Del Boy in the hit comedy series Only Fools and Horses. His examples, said with absolute conviction, included the phrases \u201cmangetout\u201d and \u201cbain marie\u201d, for \u201cno problem\u201d, \u201cbonnet de douche\u201d (shower cap) for \u201cexcellent\u201d, and \u201ccreme de la menthe\u201d for \u201cthe very best\u201d.",

        "content": "Flight attendants report having to endure racial epithets, kicking, biting and spitting from passengers in recent months\nAirline employees in the US have been facing a surge of harassment and violence in recent months, including many related to conflicts over mask-wearing mandates.\nIn a hearing on Capitol Hill on Thursday, airline employees and aviation experts laid out the scope of the problem.\nData compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) showed that investigations of plane passengers\u2019 behavior have hit record levels. In 2019, 146 passenger investigations were initiated. In 2020, that number rose slightly to 183. In comparison, 789 investigations have been launched in 2021, with three months still left in the year.\nAccording to the FAA, there have been 4,385 reports of unruly plane passengers as of this year, and 3,199 of those incidents were related to mask-wearing policies. More than 85% of attendants have dealt with unruly passengers in the first six months of 2021, according to the FAA, while nearly one in five attendants \u201creported experiencing a physical incident\u201d.\nThe House transportation and infrastructure subcommittee chairman, Democrat Rick Larsen, emphasized that airlines and the federal government must work together to protect flight attendants, who often suffer the consequences of passenger violence.\nLarsen noted that flight attendants have reported having to endure racial epithets, kicking, biting and spitting from passengers in recent months, as reports of unruly behavior have soared.\nThis summer, a video of a passenger bound to his seat with duct tape after he acted aggressively and allegedly grabbed a flight attendant\u2019s breasts was shared widely. The incident came less than a month after a woman was restrained with tape and \u201cflex cuffs\u201d during an American Airlines flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Charlotte, after she allegedly attempted to open the plane\u2019s doors.\nThe woman also \u201cphysically assaulted, bit and caused injury to a flight attendant\u201d, USA Today reported.\nAt the subcommittee hearing, Teddy Andrews, a flight attendant, recounted some of the violence that he and his co-workers have endured in recent months. During one flight, a passenger threw racial slurs at Andrews, who is Black, after he encouraged the man to wear his face mask.\nAccording to Andrews, the man said to him: \u201cN-word, I don\u2019t have to listen to a damn thing you say. This is a free country.\u201d\nThe FAA noted that the rate of violent flight incidents has declined since the start of the year but remains alarmingly high. The agency is unable to bring criminal charges but can impose fines on passengers.\n\u201cOur work is having an impact and the trend is moving in the right direction. But we need the progress to continue. This remains a serious safety threat, and one incident is one too many,\u201d the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, said in a statement ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\u201cThe FAA will continue its zero tolerance policy, keep its public awareness campaign going, and keep pushing and partnering with everyone in the aviation system to do more. We appreciate the tremendous work of all our partners in the airline, airport, labor and law enforcement communities.\u201d",

The administrators have conceded there will be several redundancies but said they are confident Derby would not be liquidated and that a buyer would be found, with six parties expressing their interest.\nLast week Rooney said he and his players discovered Derby were heading for administration after watching TV and revealed at one point he resorted to ringing Morris from the phone of the club doctor in an attempt to get answers amid the silence. \u201cI actually phoned him once off the [club] doctor\u2019s phone,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cHe [Morris] answered the phone, so obviously he could answer calls from the club doctor but not the manager. It was not ideal.\u201d\nThe administrators confirmed Derby has debt \u201cin the tens of millions\u201d. It is thought they owe HM Revenue and Customs about \u00a326m, as well as several football creditors, but Quantuma are confident of meeting the payroll of circa \u00a31.2m next week. Rooney, who sat in on the administrators\u2019 meeting with the Derby County supporters\u2019 trust on Thursday, has put his hand into his own pocket to pay for things such as equipment to film training sessions. \u201cI take this job very seriously and I want the best preparation I can get,\u201d Rooney said.\nRooney said the lack of communication from Morris was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and left him \u201churt\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Mel since 9 August,\u201d he said. \u201cMel addressed the players and the staff as a group on Tuesday, which obviously I was in on that meeting, but in a one-on-one conversation I still haven\u2019t had anything \u2013 no phone call, no message.\u201d Of that meeting, Rooney said: \u201cIn my opinion, it wasn\u2019t sincere, it was not heartfelt enough and it was not done with enough honesty. He has obviously moved on and we have to move on and put Mel Morris to the back of our minds and look forward.\u201d\nAndrew Hosking, the Quantuma managing director, said he was optimistic about Derby\u2019s future and rejected suggestions the club could follow Bury in being liquidated, predicting that the club has a \u201c95%\u201d chance of survival. \u201cI do not consider, at all, that this could be a liquidation scenario like Bury,\u201d he said. He also confirmed they are undertaking \u201coperational efficiencies\u201d to determine the scale of redundancies required. The Quantuma chief executive, Carl Jackson, said: \u201cWe are just about OK for the next seven to 10 days but we will need some funding coming in early October.\u201d\nThe automatic 12-point deduction for entering administration resulted in Derby plunging to the bottom of the Championship, on to minus points, and the club is set for a further nine-point deduction for a breach of the English Football League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules. The administrators said they have opened \u201cvery positive dialogue with the EFL\u201d and hope to sort out that issue before any prospective takeover. \u201cThe pain needs to be dealt with and dealt with in one fell swoop,\u201d Hosking said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at with the EFL.\u201d\nThe EFL\u2019s chief executive, Trevor Birch, said it was inevitable that more clubs would end up in administration like Derby unless there were structural changes to the financial model of English football. While Birch said there were only a \u201csmall handful\u201d of clubs currently under scrutiny by the EFL, he insisted that a benefactor-funded model of ownership, of the likes practised by Morris, will eventually turn sour.\n \u201cThe benefactor-funded model always works until it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Birch said. \u201cThere is an inevitability that once the benefactor turns off that tap [insolvency] is what happens. They have created an unsustainable trading model which, once that funding is stopped, the club can\u2019t sustain. Inevitably there will be another club along the line \u2013 how many and when you can never tell.\u201d\nThe EFL\u2019s preferred solution is to scrap parachute payments, but Birch said they were also arguing for financial redistribution similar to that promised in the aborted Project Big Picture, with a pooling of TV revenues between the EFL and Premier League, and 25% then going to the three lower divisions. Birch said he had had extensive conversations with Tracey Crouch over implementing such a change in her upcoming \u201cfan-led\u201d review of football governance.\n  \u201cFixing the financial cliff edge has to be the key,\u201d Birch said. \u201cWe believe that can be done by cancelling parachute payments and increasing the level of funding that is available to the EFL and the figure we put on that is a pooling of resources and receiving 25% of that. Alongside that [the EFL will set] appropriate cost controls attempting to limit wages to a percentage of turnover.\u201d",

        "content": "My friend, the Rev Rosemary Mitchell, who has died from cancer aged 54, was a brilliant historian, a dedicated teacher, and a recently ordained deacon in the Church of England.\nBorn in Poole, Dorset, she was the only child of mature parents, Leslie Mitchell, a civil servant, radio amateur and founder of the Scouting Jamboree-on-the-Air, and Eileen (nee Hawkins), a formidable woman who could, as Rosemary would say, \u201cquell a room with a single glance\u201d. She was devoted to them.\nEducated first at the Brigidine school, Windsor, and then at nearby Padworth college, Rosemary studied history at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating with a first class degree in 1988. She completed her PhD at Lincoln on the interaction between text and image in Victorian illustrated history books, which provided the foundation for her future scholarly work in interdisciplinary cultural history.\nIn 1993 she joined the original team at the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, where she was instrumental in expanding the coverage of women from the rather low baseline set in Leslie Stephen\u2019s original DNB. In 1999 she moved to Yorkshire to take up a post as a history lecturer at Leeds Trinity University, where she remained for 20 years, later appointed professor of Victorian Studies, and additionally directing the Leeds Centre for Victorian Studies. Loved by her students, to whom she was always supportive and encouraging, she was fearless in the defence of her colleagues in the face of ever-increasing bureaucratic impositions.\nHer Christian faith was central to her life, and, without being in any way pious or mawkish, she radiated what I can only call goodness. In 2019 she accepted a call to ministry and, after training at St Hild\u2019s College, Mirfield, she was ordained deacon on 3 July 2021 at Ripon Cathedral and appointed to a curacy at Skipton in North Yorkshire.\nHer death is a huge loss to the church, to her former academic colleagues and students, and, above all, to her family and friends. Rosemary had an enormous talent for making and retaining friends: the number only ever increased. She enjoyed the company of \u201cchaps\u201d, but her core circle was female. With her friends she embraced hiking in her adopted county, and, especially after she no longer had responsibility for her parents, travelling abroad; she developed a great enthusiasm for Italy. There was nothing she relished more than conversation, preferably with a glass in hand, or at least a good chocolate cake. Her warmth, wit and humour, and her sunny and sociable disposition, made her company a joy.\nIn 2019 she published, with her friend Hannah Stone, a collection of poetry, Holding Up Half the Sky, in which she continued her lifelong celebration of the variety and distinctiveness of women\u2019s experience.",

In Victoria, total supply falls from 3.5m to 3.3m due to a fall in Pfizer from 2.7m to 2.2m.\nPfizer supplies were projected to decrease in all states and territories from September to October:\nIn Queensland, from 2.15m to 1.68m\nIn Western Australia, from 1.14m to 859,000\nIn South Australia from 774,000 to 544,000\nIn Tasmania from 287,000 to 201,000\nIn the Australia Capital Territory from 218,000 to 156,000; and\nIn the Northern Territory from 154,000 to 100,000\nThe Victorian premier, Dan Andrews, revealed on Monday that the head of the national Covid vaccine taskforce, Lt Gen John Frewen, had advised states of a \u201cproblem\u201d with Pfizer supplies due in October.\nOn Monday, Hunt claimed the problem was limited to \u201cthe timing of one shipment over the course of two weeks\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to resolve that over the course of the weekend,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to ensure that our UK doses arrived earlier, and as a consequence of that, we have 1.9m doses of mRNA that are available for this week. Next week, there\u2019s an increase in that, and the following week, we\u2019ll also see well over 1.9m doses in the first week of October.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe national cabinet was told that in September that Australia\u2019s 9m inbound Pfizer doses consisted of 4.5m from the company and 4.5m from \u201cinternational partners\u201d.\nThe figures suggest that doses from bilateral deals are being used to supply the states into early October, with the 4.5m doses direct from the company arriving too late in the month to be allocated to the states.\nOn Thursday, states and territories rejected Hunt\u2019s claims the supply issue had been fixed.\nAndrews told reporters in Melbourne that Victoria was unable to reduce the dose interval for Pfizer from six to three weeks because we \u201cdon\u2019t have the stock in the fridge or the freezer\u201d and the state was \u201crationing Pfizer\u201d.\nThe NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, acknowledged \u201cthere are some issues just about how much [Pfizer] we\u2019re actually getting, and we need some clarity around that\u201d.\nThe ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said that \u201cuncertainty [of Pfizer supply] makes it difficult to open up new bookings earlier\u201d and acknowledged \u201canecdotal reports\u201d of cancellation of appointments across the primary healthcare network.\nOn Thursday morning states and territories were still in the dark about how many doses of Pfizer they would receive in the final two weeks of October.\nHunt said Victoria would receive 755,000 mRNA vaccines in the week of 4 October and 833,000 in the week of 11 October.\nAn update provided to Victoria on Thursday reveals that just 205,290 doses in the week of 4 October are Pfizer, including 54,360 from the UK deal; in the week of 11 October 234,540 are Pfizer, including 54,360 from the UK deal.\nIn the final two weeks, Victoria would receive 1.6m doses, Hunt said, although he acknowledged that \u201cfinal figures\u201d for the last fortnight of October would be confirmed in the next 48 hours.\nThe company has said that it is meeting monthly delivery targets and Hunt confirmed both Pfizer and Moderna were providing the \u201cfull supply\u201d across October.\nAsked to explain how the early October shortfall had developed, Hunt told reporters on Thursday he would \u201cleave it to them [Pfizer] to explain\u201d.\n\u201cWhat I set out on Monday is that in terms of some shipments they were moved back slightly, other shipments we were able to move forward,\u201d Hunt said. \u201c[The] problem [is] resolved. Some may seek to try to create an issue.\u201d\nAsked if there was any validity to the concerns of states and territories regarding Pfizer supplies, Hunt said: \u201cNo.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Hunt told Guardian Australia: \u201cmRNA Vaccine supply increases from over 10m doses in September to over 11m in October.\u201d\n \u201cAllocations to states and territories increase each week over the course of October.\n\u201cFinal allocations to states and territories will also confirm a week-on-week increase throughout October and an increase from September to October.\u201d\nPfizer is contracted to supply 40m doses in 2021, the bulk of which are arriving in the final quarter of the year.\nSince mid-August, Australia has signed dose-swap deals for 4m doses from the UK, 1m doses from Poland, and 500,000 doses from Singapore.\nA spokesperson for Pfizer Australia has ruled out that there had been any slowing of Australia\u2019s anticipated supply schedule as a result of the bilateral deals, but declined to answer questions about when Australia had been notified of the October supply schedule, citing confidentiality.\nThe spokesperson insisted Pfizer was on track to supply the full 40m doses in 2021 and meet monthly targets.\n\u201cPfizer has a strong relationship with the federal government with continuous engagement both locally and globally in support of their national vaccine program, including supply requests,\u201d Pfizer told Guardian Australia.",

This is not rhetoric, let alone catastrophism: this is science.\u201d\nThe comments come as the Australian government considers whether to strengthen its climate pledges in the lead-up to the UN climate summit to be held in Glasgow, which is chaired by the UK in partnership with Italy.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, told the US president, Joe Biden, in a face-to-face meeting earlier this week that the Australian government would \u201ccontinue to work on our plan as to how we can continue to reduce emissions to zero well into the future\u201d.\nThe British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the UN this week the Cop26 summit must be a \u201cturning point for humanity\u201d.\nItaly is hosting a preparatory meeting of the conference, known as the \u201cpre-Cop\u201d, and an associated youth event in late September and early October. Italy is also chair of this year\u2019s G20 summit, where climate will be one of the priorities.\n\u201cI believe that all G20 countries can and should do more, including Australia, [which] has a huge potential to become a leader in the production of clean energy,\u201d Tardioli said.\nWhen asked whether she was hopeful Australia would commit to a 2050 goal for net zero emissions by the time of the Glasgow summit, she said: \u201cI am hopeful, yes. I really hope Australia will commit to this common goal.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe said a firm decision by the federal government would \u201creinforce the global alliance of those countries who really lead the world in these endeavours\u201d.\nShe described Australia as a developed country with a strong economy and with strong research and development, so it \u201ccould easily lead by example within the international community\u201d.\nA decision on net zero \u201cwould also help sub-federal level to move more steadily towards urgent energy transition\u201d.\nTardioli suggested that \u201ccircumstances have changed\u201d when asked whether Australia should also increase its 2030 emissions reduction commitment, which has remained unaltered since the Abbott government pledged a 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels.\n\u201cThe answer is simple: recent data provided by the World Meteorological Organization have highlighted an acceleration in climate change indicators, like rising sea levels, melting sea ice and extreme weather,\u201d she said.\n\u201cCircumstances have changed over the last five years and it is only wise to take notice of this and act accordingly, raising our ambition. This decade will be crucial if the international community wants to have a real chance to achieve the key goal of keeping temperature raising within 1.5C.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nTardioli said almost 400 people, aged between 18 and 29, would meet in Milan for the Youth4Climate Conference next week. She said young people should be involved in \u201cdecision-making processes that will have enormous impact on their lives\u201d.\nThe ambassador said Italy hoped leaders would \u201clisten carefully to representative voices of future leaders of the world, and embrace their recommendations for a much more decisive action to fight climate change\u201d.\nWith just 40 days until the Glasgow summit, Biden has committed to double climate financing and China has promised to halt the funding of coal-fired power stations overseas.\nThe Australian government has said it is committed to action on climate change, but it has characterised its approach as \u201ctechnology not taxes\u201d, and it remains unclear whether it will upgrade its medium-term target. So far, Morrison has expressed only a preference to achieve net zero by 2050 amid internal divisions.\nA number of Australian politicians have expressed a view that large emitters such as India and China need to increase their level of commitment, otherwise increased emission reduction by Australia would be meaningless.\nBut Tardioli said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s latest report was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that \u201cwe all must achieve immediate, rapid and significant reductions in emissions\u201d.\n\u201cAnd we cannot simply rely on others: we must all do our part,\u201d she said.\n\u201cItaly, together with many European countries, has committed to phase out coal by 2025, based on the evidence that that it is one of the main causes of rising levels in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\u201d\nItaly has also committed to achieving net zero by 2050, and a 55% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the EU\u2019s pledges.\nAsked whether she was optimistic or pessimistic about the chances of comprehensive global action of the kind the IPCC report indicated was necessary, Tardioli said it was \u201cnot a matter of mood\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a matter of preserving the future of our future generation,\u201d she said, adding that governments around the world \u201cdo not have the luxury to fail\u201d.\nEnergy and climate ministers from the G20 \u2013 which includes Australia \u2013 agreed in Naples in July on the need for \u201cmeaningful and effective actions by all countries\u201d in order to keep the 1.5C temperature limit \u201cwithin reach\u201d.\nBut ministers at the meeting could not reach consensus on setting a date to phase out coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.",

During last year\u2019s lockdowns it slashed the amount it charged parishes by about 30% after receiving estimates from parishes of their likely fall in revenue.\nAs a result, MATC\u2019s income fell from $48.2m in 2019 to $35.4m last year, well in excess of the 15% drop required to trigger eligibility for jobkeeper for charities and churches.\nThe accounts also show the Melbourne diocese estimated its current liabilities to sexual abuse victims at $14.3m.\nIn 2019, after the child sexual abuse royal commission, the diocese estimated its liability for abuse at $15.8m, based on 126 potential claimants for compensation.\nThis dropped to $14.3m in 2020 after \u201csubtracting any claims paid during the year\u201d, the diocese said in its accounts.\nJustin Lachal, the general manager of the Melbourne Anglican Diocesan Corporation (MADC), a church entity that has responsibilities including dealing with claims against the Melbourne diocese, said that during last year\u2019s lockdowns the diocese surveyed parishes about their income.\n\u201cWith this information, MADC determined that it would need to reduce the level of recoveries to parishes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt did so not completely but by approximately 30%, which approximated the expected reduction in income levels of the parishes in aggregate.\u201d\nJobkeeper enabled parishes to \u201cmaintain employment at similar levels to prior to the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEvery dollar the diocese received from the government under the jobkeeper scheme was passed on to employees who qualified for the support in the same way other Australian workers did.\n\u201cNo money was deducted for any reason including the paying of redress. The diocese is funding redress payments from a separate church budget and the taxpayer is not subsidising church redress.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe child abuse royal commission heard that, across Australia, the Anglican church received 1,115 complaints of child sexual abuse between January 1980 and December 2015.",

If history is any guide, very little. The Pumas have only won two of 18 Tests against the Wallabies on Australian soil \u2013 an 18-3 win in Brisbane in 1983 and a 23-19 victory on the Gold Coast in 2018.\nSure, Argentina drew with the Wallabies twice in the Tri Nations tournament last year, but as Pumas coach Mario Ledesma observed the Australian side is a \u201cdifferent beast\u201d following the addition of Japan-based inside backs Quade Cooper and Samu Kerevi.\nIt will be a completely different mindset for the Wallabies heading into the Argentina match. The Australians will shed their underdog tag and enter the game as strong favourites.\nThe twin objectives will be to not allow Argentina to bring them down to their level and to avoid getting carried away with their success against the Springboks.\nThe Wallabies need to play with the same composure and discipline that were features of their performances against South Africa.\nThere might be a temptation to revert to the high-tempo, expansive style of game they tried to play unsuccessfully against the All Blacks in the Bledisloe Cup series, but they would be wise to stick to a formula that actually worked.\nThe Wallabies played uncharacteristically conservatively in their 28-26 win in the first Test against South Africa on the Gold Coast, but kept the Springboks guessing by moving the ball wide occasionally in their 30-17 win in the second Test in Brisbane last Saturday night. They found a lot of space in the middle of the field.\nThe Australian forwards should be able to dominate Argentina up front and provide a platform for the backs, who will be itching to attack, but they must remain patient, build pressure and take opportunities when they arise.\nThe last thing the Wallabies want to do is make a lot of unforced errors which will only keep Argentina in the contest.\nWallabies coach Dave Rennie has made only three changes to the 23-man squad with utility back Reece Hodge starting at fullback in place of the injured Tom Banks, Rob Leota at blindside flanker for his run-on debut and veteran back James O\u2019Connor returning from injury via the reserves bench.\nThis was an intelligent selection as the Wallabies can potentially secure second place behind the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship with a win against Argentina, and that would be a creditable result for a team that finished last in the Tri Nations last year.\nIdeally, if the Wallabies win, Rennie can select players who have not received much \u2013 or any \u2013 game time for the second Test against Argentina the following week, while refreshing some big-minute players for the upcoming tour of Japan and Europe.\nHodge beat O\u2019Connor and reserve outside back Jordan Petaia for the gold No 15 jersey. If the Wallabies intend to play for field position, Hodge\u2019s massive boot will be helpful, but he was a little uncertain under the high ball when he replaced Banks during the Springboks Test last Saturday.\nIn his first start for the year at fullback, Hodge will need to be much safer under the high ball on Saturday night because the Pumas will bombard him if they find he is suspect.\nThe choice of Leota at No 6 was surprising, if only because so much attention focused on Japan-based back-rower Sean McMahon\u2019s return to the Wallabies\u2019 wider squad, but the Melbourne Rebels forward deserves a chance in the starting line-up after some good performances off the bench.\nMcMahon, who has not played for the Wallabies since 2017, is almost certain to play against Argentina in the second Test next week, possibly at No 8 to give Rob Valetini a rest.\nIt will be interesting to see if former Wallabies coach and current Pumas assistant, Michael Cheika, has devised any tactics to contain Cooper and Kerevi, who have transformed Australia\u2019s back play.\nCheika was the last Wallabies mentor to coach Cooper. Like Rennie, Cheika recalled Cooper from the international wilderness, but then let him go again. Cheika\u2019s insights into how Cooper and Kerevi combine could be extremely valuable to the Pumas.\nThis is an important Test against a respected opponent. The Wallabies may have risen up the world rankings, but they can slip down again just as quickly if they are not careful.",

        "content": "Described by another expert as a \u2018fantastic life-saving idea\u2019, the simple procedure could save lives by stopping catastrophic blood loss from shark bites\nAn emergency department doctor says he has developed a simple new way to help save the lives of shark attack victims in the crucial moments after a bite.\nThe technique is described in a paper published today in the journal of Emergency Medicine Australasia and works by closing off the femoral artery to prevent a person from rapidly bleeding out.\nApplying the technique relies on a second person making a fist and pressing it into a person\u2019s groin at the central point between the hip bone and the genitals.\nFrom there they only need to lock their arm straight and use their bodyweight to apply pressure until blood flow from the wound stops.\nFollowing these steps then buys the victim time while help can be sought.\nDr Nicholas Taylor, Associate Dean of the ANU Medical School, surfer and lead author on the study said he began to develop the idea after a family holiday to Western Australia at a time when there had been a spate of shark attacks.\n\u201cI was looking for a few ways to make myself a bit more shark proof,\u201d he says.\nAfter speaking to surf life savers and surfers he found most would instinctually react to a shark bite wound by placing direct pressure on it or attempting to make a tourniquet from material they had on hand.\nDr Taylor said his emergency room training told him that this would be a mistake.\n\u201cA shark bite is a terrible sawing motion and putting pressure on it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it would be great if every surfer carried a tourniquet, but it isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\nA better solution, he thought, would be to cut the blood flow from the femoral artery as taught in medical schools and performed in emergency departments.\nTo test the effectiveness of the technique, Dr Taylor helped organise a study of 34 healthy volunteers. While the sample size was small, it was more than double the 16 participants a pilot study recommended was required for it to be statistically significant.\nParticipants were given no prior training or instruction in how to apply the manoeuvre before attempting it, and the results were compared to the effects from using a makeshift tourniquet from surfboard leg rope.\nClosing off the femoral artery stopped all blood flow to the leg in three out of four participants while using the tourniquet reduced blood flow by 43.8%. An ultrasound was used to gauge the rate of blood flow through the artery and into the limb.\nThe researchers also tested whether a wetsuit might make it more difficult but found it made no difference.\nNow Dr Taylor says he wants to see the technique incorporated into first aid training \u2013 and to help he has developed a mnemonic for remembering the process: \u201cpush hard between the hip and the bits\u201d.\nHowever, for that to happen it would first need to be endorsed by the Australian Resuscitation Council and incorporated into their guidelines for managing bleeding wounds.\nDr Anthony Brown, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Queensland who was not involved in the study said the novel approach was \u201cbrilliant\u201d and should be considered for inclusion in first aid training programs, particularly for surf-life saving and the surfing community at large.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic life-saving idea. Nothing else helps,\u201d Dr Brown said. \u201cBy the time you need to give mouth-to-mouth or CPR during a shark attack, it\u2019s too late. It means the person has exsanguinated [drained of blood].\u201d\nCompared to applying pressure on the wound itself, Dr Brown said that this technique would be more effective as it would avoid potentially re-opening arteries that may have closed off by spasm.\n\u201cYour sole priority needs to be to stop the bleeding and wait for help,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit buggered if you\u2019re the only one there, but generally speaking there is someone else there to help. Nobody surfs alone.\u201d",

        "content": "The director\u2019s death aged 65 is a huge blow for British cinema, whose very best qualities \u2013 of wit, intelligence and subtlety \u2013 Michell exemplified\nRoger Michell was the TV and movie director who had a midas touch with actors and with a particular type of English material: witty, literate, poignant and romantic. Michell was a master at directing anything on the continuum between Jane Austen and Richard Curtis, and knew what animated both.\nHe had what came to be seen as his masterpiece in 1999 with his international smash, the Richard Curtis-scripted comedy Notting Hill, in which he elicited great performances from Hugh Grant as the hopeless west London bookshop owner and Julia Roberts as the unattainable movie star with whom he falls wildly in love. Fans and non-fans alike will concede the schmaltzy but heartfelt power of that movie\u2019s legendary scene in which Roberts tearfully begs Grant to love and forgive her: \u201cI\u2019m just a girl standing in front of a boy \u2026 \u201d Michell directed those two stars in that iconic scene with a master\u2019s confidence.\nBut what is so devastatingly sad about his death now at the age of just 65 years old is that it comes before the national release of something festival audiences have been hailing as even better \u2013 his final film, the true-life comedy The Duke, starring Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren, about the theft of the Wellington portrait from the National Gallery in 1961.\n  Like Stephen Frears or Mike Newell, Michell came up through the classic route: a grounding in drama and classical literature at university and \u2013 on graduating \u2013 in subsidised and non-subsidised theatre and then television work gave him a sense of where to place the camera and how to shape performance in relationship to the camera lens.\nIn 1995, he had a major career breakthrough directing an exhilaratingly confident and seductive BBC adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion with Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Captain Wentworth \u2013 it came out the same year as the BBC\u2019s Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth sexily diving into the lake at Pemberley, and so Michell\u2019s Austen was a little bit upstaged, but his work was respected and it was certainly admired by Curtis, who put him forward for Notting Hill.\nThe colossal success of Notting Hill made Michell a Hollywood player, a solidly grounded British professional who could take on anything and fearlessly wrangle the biggest stars. His drama-thriller Changing Lanes (2002) was a fiercely uncomfortable study in that once fashionable subject of anger management with Samuel L Jackson, Ben Affleck and Sydney Pollack. His next movie The Mother (2003), scripted by Hanif Kureishi was even more startling: Anne Reid starred as the older woman who has a passionate affair with a younger man \u2013 the pre-007 Daniel Craig.\nThe Ian McEwan novel Enduring Love \u2013 with the quibbling play on words in the title \u2013 returned Michell to his real gift for Englishness, romance and dark tragicomedy: the Joe Penhall adaptation in 1997 allowed Michell to exercise his skill with dialogue and actors, and if the result was a little slender, Michell certainly handled the legendary opening scene with the hot air balloon with great aplomb.\nBut it was in 2006 that Michell had a script \u2013 again from Kureishi, again with a May-to-December romantic theme \u2013 that allowed him to luxuriate in English romance and English regret. In Venus, Peter O\u2019Toole, then 74, played an ageing English thespian who, with Larkinian sadness and unabashed yearning, falls in love and lust with the young great-niece of an old friend: this being Jessie, played by Jodie Whittaker. It is a classic piece of upscale British screen drama, and Michell handled it with great style, as ever giving prominence to the actors and their dialogue, rather than to any coercive directorial vision.\nHis more American movies Morning Glory (2010) and Hyde Park on Hudson (2012) were bigger-budgeted and glitzier films but did not have quite the flavour of his best work: Morning Glory, with Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford, is the gossipy drama about a TV morning show and Hyde Park on Hudson is an odd but underpowered drama about Britain\u2019s new King and Queen (Samuel West and Olivia Colman) making a visit in 1939 to the American president, Franklin D Roosevelt, played in dreamy style by Bill Murray \u2013 perhaps there was no rapport between actors and director here.\n  Where there certainly was a rapport was in the later movies, Le Week-End (2013) with Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan having a bittersweet romantic getaway in Paris and My Cousin Rachel (2017), a thoroughly enjoyable romantic drama based on a Daphne du Maurier novel, starring a feline Rachel Weisz.\nBut it was with a documentary at about this time that Michell came up with a rip-roaring gem of a film with enough sheer enjoyment factor to match anything on his CV. It was his documentary Nothing Like A Dame in which he did nothing but sit Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Joan Plowright around a table and let them gossip about their careers, how the business has changed, how attitudes to women have changed (or not) and about the vain and impossible men they have had to work with.\nIt took a directing genius to let these vivid personalities speak so extensively and so hilariously about their work \u2013 perhaps the director\u2019s job looked easy, but it cannot have been. This documentary joyfully played to all Michell\u2019s strengths: his theatrical grounding, his style and wit and above all his great love of actors. It is such a sadness that he is gone.\n This article was amended on 24 September 2021 because an earlier version, in one instance, misnamed the film Morning Glory as Morning Story.",

On Wednesday, the former prime minister Gordon Brown wrote in an article for the Guardian that the cut was the most \u201csocially divisive and morally indefensible\u201d he had witnessed in UK politics.\nIn a sign of the political pressure faced by Johnson, while defending the cut to reporters during his US trip this week, the prime minister refused repeatedly to say whether he could live on the basic UC payment of \u00a3118 a week.\nJohnson said he had \u201cevery sympathy for people who are finding it tough\u201d, but highlighted the cost of maintaining the \u00a320 increase. Pressed on the fact this could be seen as saying no by default, he responded only: \u201cThose are your words.\u201d\nUnder current rules, if someone is paid more than a set allowance while receiving the benefit, then for every pound above that they earn, 63p is taken off their benefit payments. This had been reduced from 65p in 2017, and the DWP plan would see it fall again, to 60p.\nIn practice, tax and national insurance further increases the amount deducted by the taper. Labour says a single parent working 30 hours a week on the national living wage loses \u00a3573 a month of their universal credit entitlement \u2013 equivalent to a marginal tax rate of 75% \u2013 which it contrasts with the 47% marginal tax rate faced by high earners.\nA reduction in the taper rate would mollify some Conservative MPs worried about the cut, not least as it would reinforce the notion of people gaining more by working extra hours. However, the budget is on 27 October, three weeks after the end of the UC uplift.\nA cut to the taper would also only boost the incomes of the approximately 40% who are in work, and among those, only people whose jobs and circumstances allowed them to take on extra hours. Given this, among factors the Treasury will examine is whether the cost of cutting the taper would be the most efficient way to help people.\nIt would also by no means compensate most claimants for the \u00a320 cut, an end to a boost to universal credit introduced to help families amid coronavirus.\nThe Resolution Foundation thinktank said reducing the taper rate by three percentage points was in itself a positive move but should not be seen as an alternative to retaining the uplift. A working family with kids and housing costs with a post-tax income of \u00a315,000, for example, would be just \u00a35.13 a week better off.\n\u201cThe gains are far smaller than the \u00a320-a-week cut, and would flow to better off families on universal credit while 3 million families would gain nothing at all. Virtually all households would still be significantly worse off overall,\u201d said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.\nFunding a reduced taper rate would not be insubstantial, although it is likely to be far less than the \u00a36bn-a-year cost of extending the \u00a320 uplift. Some estimates suggest every percentage point reduction in the taper rate would cost \u00a3350m.\nReducing the universal credit taper rate is one of the Labour party\u2019s few solid commitments to so far emerge from its review of tax and welfare policy, though it has not specified a target reduction.",

Then it was surging energy prices. Now the news that oil companies are rationing deliveries of petrol and diesel to garage forecourts has provided an ever louder echo of Britain in the 1970s.\nBy the standards of the past, the situation has not reached the crisis levels of 1973, when there was talk of motorists being forced to use petrol rationing coupons leftover from the second world war. Nor is the government facing a strike by tanker drivers, as was the case in early 1979 during the winter of discontent.\nMore recently, Tony Blair threatened to call in the army in the face of the autumn 2000 fuel protests that led to panic-buying and the country almost grinding to a halt. Things are not yet that bad, although the government will be alive to the risk that they soon could be.\nIn 1973 the problem was that oil-producing countries imposed an embargo that limited the supply of crude. In 1979, it was industrial action. This time, the refineries are well stocked with fuel, but petrol companies lack the drivers to deliver it.\nThe latest snapshot of business from the Office for National Statistics shows that the transportation and storage industry currently has only 80% of firms working \u2013 the lowest for any sector of the economy. Some companies have ceased trading during the pandemic, many more are temporarily closed because of a lack of staff.\nLow pay is a key factor. Driving a HGV vehicle is a tough job that is rewarded relatively poorly. BP and the other oil companies are now struggling to retain staff at a time when the big supermarket chains are offering \u00a31,000 sign-on bonuses to new drivers.\nThe government says it is making it easier for new drivers to get their HGV licences but this won\u2019t help much in the short term. Ministers are under growing pressure to ease visa restrictions for EU drivers, but this is no magic bullet because it would take months for new workers to arrive.\nLike Jim Callaghan in 1979, Downing Street says there is no crisis and has advised motorists to carry on as normal. Quietly, though, ministers will be working on contingency plans that would involve soldiers being drafted in to deliver fuel. It would not be a good look for Boris Johnson to be hosting November\u2019s Cop26 climate change conference with the country at a standstill.",

She is determined to use the role as a platform to call for action on the climate emergency.\nAnd she is open to any last minute bookings at Cop26, which begins in Glasgow at the end of October.\n\u201cI would love to do it \u2013 I could do my entire show for them,\u201d she said. Swann\u2019s environmental routine, which she usually performs in front of children, includes tricks highlighting animal extinction, polluted oceans and saving energy.\nShe added: \u201cIt would be amazing to be invited. To do my environmental magic on a stage like that would be one hell of a gig. I don\u2019t think it would be possible, but if I did it would be a real dream come true.\u201d\nSwann, who has been conjuring since she was five, describes a trick that she would most like to perform in front of world leaders.\nShe said: \u201cFor Cop26 I would probably do my piece that describes the basic science of climate change. I have a clear balloon that represents the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and I have a black ball that represents gases such as carbon dioxide. And that appears inside the balloon to show pumping those gases into the atmosphere.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI proceed to use a needle to represent the sun\u2019s energy and it gets stuck on the ball. It\u2019s a really clear demonstration of the basic science behind climate change, which I\u2019m sure they will know, but I think sometimes seeing it demonstrated really brings the message home.\u201d\nSwann reckons her experience of performing for children would help convey the basic message to world leaders.\nShe said: \u201cThere is something about demonstrating the message clearly and simply that really helps to get it home. Magic is a great communications tool. It engages people and it\u2019s fun and memorable. If people can remember the magic trick they are more likely to remember the message that came with it. And that\u2019s the key to getting action.\u201d\nIn one simple routine Swann outlines various threats to wildlife and the planet while tearing up a piece of string. At the end of the trick the string is magically restored to convey the message that even seemingly impossible things are achievable.\nSwann said: \u201cI don\u2019t just use any old magic trick and add a message to it, I think about what gets the message across clearly. I also have a routine about saving energy as well. For children I use lightbulbs, for adults I tend to use coins, to demonstrate that saving energy also saves money.\u201d\nSwann is keen to challenge outdated perceptions about the previously male-dominated world of magic.\nShe said: \u201cA lot of people have an old-fashioned image of what a magician is and if you knew a lot of magicians you\u2019d realise it is out of date. Their average age has really dropped and there are a lot of modern performers out there. I would love to see more women in magic. Having role models is really important.\n\u201cMagic for good is something I\u2019m really passionate about. The Magic Circle has already helped me get my environmental message out there. It is a great platform and I will combine them as much as possible.\u201d",

Instead of storing gas, the UK has increasingly relied on a \u201cjust-in-time model\u201d for supply.\nCentrica, the owner of British Gas, closed a major storage site built under the sea bed along the Yorkshire coast in 2017 after ministers refused requests for subsidies to help maintain the facility. The remaining sites, such as Aldbrough, which is run by SSE, and Stublach, which is operated by Storengy, cover a fraction of annual demand.\nEd Miliband, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, accused the minister of being \u201ccomplacent about the situation we are facing\u201d by approaching the looming supplier failures as though it \u201cwas normal for a number of suppliers to go down each winter\u201d.\n\u201cBut what we are dealing with is far from normal \u2013 800,000 customers losing their suppliers yesterday alone, 1.5 million in the last six weeks,\u201d Miliband said in the Commons.\nKwarteng rebuffed claims that the government had been complacent, and said the \u201corganised process\u201d by which households were switched to a new supplier was \u201cwell established\u201d.\n\u201cIn terms of subsidies or grants to larger companies, I can categorically say to this House we will not be giving any grants or subsidies to larger companies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur approach will be informed by the following principles: protecting customers, especially vulnerable ones, from price spikes. And the solution to this crisis will be found from the industry and the market, as is already happening,\u201d he added.",

        "content": "A curious debate is swirling around the success of Thomas Tuchel\u2019s remarkably miserly but often thrilling side\nA couple of weeks ago the Netherlands coach, Louis van Gaal, got into an argument with a scornful Dutch journalist about Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea. \u201cThe one that applauds defensive football is you,\u201d the journalist said. \u201cYou want to play the same way as Chelsea and Liverpool.\u201d At this provocation, Van Gaal shifted himself a fraction of an inch higher in his seat, like a praying mantis preparing to snap the head off a snake.\n\u201cIs that defensive football in your opinion?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Chelsea play that way.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not at all,\u201d Van Gaal retorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You are just a journalist. You have no vision of football. With 5-3-2 and 5-2-3, you can play great attacking football. Chelsea shows that every time, with different selections. I take my hat off to Mr Tuchel for that.\u201d\nOf course, Van Gaal sparring with the Dutch press over tactics is hardly news. But that terse exchange did manage to encapsulate the curious debate swirling around Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea, a team that have swept all before them in Europe and are now strongly tipped to do likewise at home. After five league games their only blemish \u2013 and only conceded goal \u2013 was a penalty in a 1-1 draw at Anfield, a match Chelsea ended with 10 men. A victory over Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday will see them installed as runaway favourites for the title.\nAt the heart of this success has been that impregnable wall at the back, which has now amassed an improbable 24 clean sheets in 36 games in all competitions. In the course of their 3-0 win at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday the hosts completed only one pass into the penalty area. Aston Villa had nine of their 18 shots blocked a fortnight ago. Cameron Archer\u2019s goal for Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday was only the second headed goal Chelsea have conceded since Tuchel arrived in January.\nAll of which raises a number of questions. What exactly are Chelsea getting so right? How on earth are you meant to score against them? And are Chelsea actually a defensive team, or simply a team that are excellent at defending? This last dichotomy is perhaps best expressed by their opponents on Saturday. Pep Guardiola\u2019s City have shown that it is possible to defend brilliantly without ever really being characterised as a defensive team.\nCentral to this is the very modern dogma of possession and territory as defensive tactics in their own right: in other words, the best way to defend is to make sure you do as little defending as possible. Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea, by contrast, do plenty. On many metrics their statistical profile more closely resembles a team battling relegation than a side chasing the title.\nSo far this season 32% of the action has taken place in their defensive third; only Norwich, Newcastle and Brentford have more. Chelsea have made more tackles and interceptions than any other club. To put that into perspective, on that same metric City rank 20th out of 20.\nWe are still dealing with relatively small sample sizes here, but in many areas these are trends we saw last season too. More than most recent title contenders, Chelsea seem content to invite pressure, to put bodies on the line, to relish the art of defending.\n\u201cPure will, with resilience,\u201d gushed Tuchel after his side\u2019s rearguard action at Anfield. \u201cNever lose the shape, try to close the half-spaces.\u201d Occasionally in punditry, and more often in the idiot-pulpits of social media, you see \u201ctactics\u201d and \u201cpassion\u201d placed at opposite ends of a spectrum, perhaps even opposing ideals in a football culture war.\nIn fact, as virtually all elite coaches will tell you, one is largely inseparable from the other. A defensive tactic is only as effective as the will and commitment to carry it out. Resilience and desire are only effective insofar as they are tethered to a cogent, coherent strategy.\nChelsea\u2019s defensive excellence has been built as much on superb individuals as on a functional collective: the mobile Antonio R\u00fcdiger, the versatile Andreas Christensen, the tenacious C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta. Ahead of them Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 block passing lanes and squeeze space.\nIn goal, \u00c9douard Mendy has made an outstanding start to the season. Trevoh Chalobah has returned from a loan spell at Lorient a transformed player. Above all this is a defence built in the image of the 37-year-old Thiago Silva: calm assurance on the ball, intelligent distribution, but above all a willingness to do the ugly jobs.\nIs this actually sustainable? Probably not: Chelsea may have conceded only one goal but their xG against is actually 5.5. Meanwhile, Tuchel himself has admitted that Mendy has been a little too active for his liking.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it too much when he\u2019s in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the most satisfying feeling for a coach.\u201d This, in turn is an admission that Chelsea\u2019s superlative defending is less an intentional approach and more a product of circumstances, not least the strength of the teams they have faced so far.\nFor all this, City are likely to offer more of the same on Saturday: a bold, possession-based approach that will probe the Chelsea backline for gaps, force them to make clearances, block shots and crosses. Tuchel\u2019s long-term aim will be to get his side further up the pitch, dominating games, squeezing out attacks at source. In the short term, however, there\u2019s plenty more conventional defending to do first.",

        "content": "Brooks Koepka took umbrage with the golfing media\u2019s coverage of recent comments that team sports were \u201cjust maybe not in his DNA\u201d, which have snowballed into public questioning of his commitment to Team USA and the Ryder Cup.\nThe four-times major champion, in his first public remarks since suffering a wrist injury at the Tour Championship three weeks ago, spent a good chunk of Thursday morning\u2019s pre-tournament press conference at Whistling Straits addressing the blowback from a Golf Digest interview in which he described Ryder Cup week as hectic and \u201ca bit odd\u201d because he is forced to break from his individual routine and given no time to decompress.\n\u201cI never said it was negative,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cI said it was different. Like I said, I\u2019ve never played any of these team events [before turning pro]. I didn\u2019t play Walker Cup. Never played Junior Ryder Cup. Never played anything. I just said it\u2019s different. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. Y\u2019all spun it that way.\u201d The 31-year-old went on to insist: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be nervous on that first tee if I didn\u2019t care.\u201d\nOn the status of his frosty relationship with his US teammate Bryson DeChambeau, Koepka was notably shorter. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same team together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had dinner almost every night as a team. I got here Monday and everyone in the team is interacting, everybody is participating in conversations and doing everything we need to do.\u201d The contrast between the Americans\u2019 self-defeating individualism and the Europeans\u2019 team spirit remains the oldest chestnut around this biennial event but like most stereotypes there is at least a kernel of truth to it.\nHow else to explain why the side that routinely comes in with the superior players has won only two of nine Ryder Cups this century \u2013 and five of 17 going back to 1985? This year\u2019s showdown along the windy, western shores of Lake Michigan, which was put back by a year because of the pandemic, is no different.\nSteve Stricker\u2019s 12-man team includes 10 of the world\u2019s top 13 players while Europe boasts only the top-ranked Jon Rahm. As hosts the US will enjoy the familiar advantage of being able to cater the setup of the 7,500-yard track to their strengths and a magnified edge in crowd support due to Covid-19 travel restrictions on European-based spectators.\nThis dissonance is at the essence of what makes Ryder Cups such absorbing theatre and it has seemed to find a fresh symbol in Koepka, one of the veterans on a US team featuring six rookies, the most for the Americans since 2008 when they won at Valhalla.\nMatch oneJustin Thomas and Jordan Spieth versus Jon Rahm and Sergio Garc\u00eda\nMatch twoDustin Johnson and Collin Morikawa versus Paul Casey and Viktor Hovland\nMatch threeBrooks Koepka and Daniel Berger versus Lee Westwood and Matt Fitzpatrick\nMatch fourPatrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele versus Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Koepka told Golf Digest. \u201cThere are times where I\u2019m like, \u2018I won my match. I did my job. What do you want from me?\u2019 I know how to take responsibility for the shots I hit every week. Now, somebody else hit a bad shot and left me in a bad spot, and I know this hole is a loss. That\u2019s new, and you have to change the way you think about things. You go from an individual sport all the time to a team sport one week a year.\u201d\nThose remarks got the attention of Paul Azinger, the former US team captain turned NBC pundit who openly questioned whether Koepka should be a part of the team.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure he loves the Ryder Cup that much, if he doesn\u2019t love it he should relinquish his spot and get people there who do love it,\u201d Azinger said during a conference call last week. \u201cNot everybody embraces it. But if you don\u2019t love it, and you\u2019re not sold out, then I think Brooks \u2013 especially being hurt \u2013 should consider whether or not he really wants to be there. And if you add the Bryson [DeChambeau] dynamic to that, that would be an even easier decision for him.\u201d\nBut Koepka, who has played on the last two Ryder Cup teams and competed on an injured ankle in the 2016 US PGA Championship in order to qualify, was clearly frustrated on Thursday with how those remarks were framed by the media.\n\u201cI can only do my job and then y\u2019all report, or whatever, your opinion or side might be,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cYou guys spun it negatively, so it\u2019s going to trickle to the fans because you guys are kind of our only outlet besides social media. So it\u2019s how you guys take it and spin it and you guys put it negatively.\n\u201cSo whatever they think will be off what they read, whether you write an article or whatever you\u2019re doing. They read that stuff. So if it\u2019s your guys\u2019 opinion, they\u2019re going to take that side a little bit more.\u201d\nThe most common answer to Europe\u2019s improbable run of success is familiarity with the format. Alternate shot is the game of choice on Saturday mornings on courses from Ireland to Spain. Compare that to the chest-pounding American egos that get US pairs fighting over whose sponsor\u2019s ball to use in foursomes.\nKoepka only lent credence to the theory on Thursday, admitting the first time he played a foursomes match was at Hazeltine five years ago.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play on any teams growing up,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cSo this is like the first time I\u2019ve done the team thing other than college. I\u2019ve never played alternate shots until I got here. Some of the guys probably have that luxury because they played Walker Cup and stuff like that, so they might have a better idea. I like it. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s just tough to kind of build a rhythm.\n\u201cYou hit one good shot and you\u2019re going to wait 15 minutes before you hit the next one. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just who plays better.\u201d",

        "content": "Captain Heather Knight struck a magnificent century in the fourth ODI at Derby, as England overcame New Zealand\u2019s total of 244 with three wickets left \u2013 their highest ever successful run chase in one-day internationals \u2013 to seal a 3-1 series win with one game left to play.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been at our best as a batting group the last couple of games and I was desperate today to be the one to try and hit a big score for the team,\u201d Knight said.\nShe labelled her knock of 101 her best innings in 50-over cricket, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a monkey off my back. I haven\u2019t got another ODI hundred since the first one, in the 2017 World Cup.\u201d\nA career-best four for 47 from seamer Hannah Rowe ensured the run chase was not without tension. Rowe\u2019s first spell reduced England from 52 without loss to 71 for three. Lauren Winfield-Hill (33) was bowled by a ball that jagged back off the pitch, while Tammy Beaumont (16) edged behind and Nat Sciver (11) tangled herself up playing around a straight one and was trapped lbw.\nKnight shared a century partnership with Amy Jones to calm English nerves, but Rowe struck again in the 38th over \u2013 Jones (40) toeing to mid-off with 74 runs still needed. Amy Satterthwaite then trapped Sophia Dunkley lbw for a duck, to leave England 185 for five in the 40th over.\nRowe\u2019s final over, though, cost 13 runs \u2013 including a six smashed over the legside by the unflappable Danni Wyatt (27 off 27 balls) \u2013 and Knight calmly continued on her way to three figures, bringing up the milestone with a drive through backward point in the 47th over.\nBoth eventually fell in the 49th over, Knight holing out to deep midwicket before Wyatt heaved across the line and was trapped lbw. But Anya Shrubsole walloped Leigh Kasperek down the ground for four before biffing a single \u2013 and despite Katey Martin whipping off the bails to stump Sophie Ecclestone, Kasperek\u2019s delivery was wide, sealing the deal with three balls to spare.\nEarlier New Zealand had been reduced to 33 for three in the powerplay after Knight won the toss and inserted the visitors. Suzie Bates (17) had sent Shrubsole\u2019s first two balls of the series crashing to the boundary, but in the sixth over she hit the ball to Sciver at midwicket, dashed down the pitch, was sent back and dived too early. The wicketkeeper, Jones, ran Bates out an inch short of her crease.\nShrubsole, who had sat on the sidelines for the first three ODIs after spraining her ankle in training a fortnight ago, then took wickets in successive overs: Tuesday\u2019s heroine Maddy Green gently plonked one into the hands of Freya Davies at mid-on for a duck, before Lauren Down (41) was deceived by a beauty that swung in and straightened to take out her off stump.\nSophie Devine took on Ecclestone, slogging her over deep backward square for six, but was trapped lbw by Charlie Dean (three for 52) nine runs short of her half-century. Devine\u2019s appeal to the third umpire was more in hope in expectation: ball tracking indicated the impact would have been halfway down middle stump.\nHalf-centuries from Satterthwaite (54) and Martin (65 not out), and some hefty ball striking from Brooke Halliday (28 from 19) at the back end of the innings, though, saw New Zealand recover to 244 for eight.\nEngland\u2019s slip-ups in the field helped them on their way. Ecclestone put down a caught-and-bowled chance against Satterthwaite while she was on 13, while Martin was rapped on the pad by Dean when still in single figures, and was fortunate that England chose not to review it \u2013 replays showing that the ball would have gone on to hit leg stump.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to contribute to the team \u2013 I haven\u2019t done that for such a long period of time, in ODI cricket especially,\u201d Martin said. \u201cTo compete regularly against the world champions is such a confidence builder for us.\u201d",

This year is on track to be the deadliest for trans and gender non-conforming Americans with at least 36 people killed, the majority of whom were Black and Latinx transgender women. LGBTQ+ people are nearly four times more likely than non-LGBTQ+ people to be victims of violent crime, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault, according to a UCLA study.\n\u201cWe know that LGBTQ people are more often the victims of violent crimes. Within the LGBTQ community because of lack of acceptance, discrimination and harassment, we see higher rates of suicidal ideation,\u201d said Samuel Garrett-Pate, the communications director for Equality California, an advocacy group that supported the bill. \u201cWe only know how best to address these important issues when we have the data.\u201d\nThe bill will require counties be trained to identify and collect clinical data related to sexual orientation and gender identity. The coroner or medical examiner of that county will submit annual reports on the data to the state department of public health and county board of supervisors for three years.\n\u201cBy training coroners and medical examiners how to gather mortality data with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity, researchers and policymakers can begin to learn who the most vulnerable in the LGBTQ community are, and allocate resources that will reduce the number of preventable deaths,\u201d the bill reads.\nSanta Clara, Los Angeles, Stanislaus and Fresno counties have agreed to participate in the program, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, which will include a mix of rural, suburban and urban counties in the north, south and central areas of the state.\nThe author of the bill, the assemblyman and former emergency room doctor Joaquin Arambula, told the newspaper that he created the bill because he saw first-hand the disproportionate violence among LGBTQ+ patients.\n\u201cWhile working on the frontlines, I had many of those experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cI was there and felt like this was a glaring need to better understand violent deaths.\u201d\nEquality California, which supported the bill along with the Trevor Project, has called the legislation a victory.\n\u201cIt will help us better understand the problems confronting the community both in terms of hate crimes but also suicide and then prioritize resources,\u201d Garrett-Pate said. \u201cHaving this information about how these issues impact the LGBTQ community is critically important to our response.\u201d\nIn the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

Foreign nurses are being blocked from work in New South Wales because of bureaucratic hurdles. Josh Frydenberg will make the economic case for Australia adopting a net-zero climate commitment, warning the country has a lot to lose if others believe \u201cwe are not transitioning in line with the rest of the world\u201d. And, at the Adelaide Zoo, sex-shy pandas will try it the \u201cold fashioned way\u201d in the hope of conceiving a cub.\nLeaked figures, seen by Guardian Australia, confirm concerns that the supply of Pfizer vaccines to states and territories will be reduced in October, the critical month that NSW and Victoria intend to reach the 70% vaccination target and push towards further reopening at 80%. The national cabinet told the states and territories their allocations of Pfizer will fall from 10.9m in September to 8.4m in October.\nOverseas-trained nurses in Australia are frustrated they can\u2019t work in NSW hospitals, which are desperate for staff to deal with Covid patients, because they can\u2019t travel to Adelaide for an in-person exam required for some foreign degree holders. \u201cIt is a real war zone, and I am sitting at home numb and helpless, having a vast experience in critical care,\u201d said a Colombian nurse who is unable to gain registration in NSW because she can\u2019t go to South Australia due to closed state borders.\nAt the meeting with business leaders today, Josh Frydenberg will make the economic case for Australia adopting a net-zero commitment, warning the country can\u2019t risk being perceived as a climate change pariah by financial markets. With the government attempting to land a formal commitment to net zero by 2050 ahead of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, the federal treasurer will note that trillions of dollars are being mobilised globally in support of the transition, and 129 countries have now committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In the lead-up to Cop26, co-chaired by the UK and Italy, the Italian ambassador to Canberra has warned that there is \u201cno time to lose\u201d in fighting the climate crisis and expressed hopes that Australia will commit to net-zero emissions. \u201cThere is no second chance if we fail,\u201d Francesca Tardioli said in an interview with Guardian Australia.\nAustralia\u2019s competition watchdog is examining the proposed acquisition of one of the country\u2019s largest independent brewers, Fermentum, by multinational beverage giant Lion. Fermentum is best known for craft beer brand Stone & Wood, and major players Lion and Carlton and United Breweries control 80% of Australia\u2019s beer market.\nThe National Rural Health Alliance has called on the federal government to transfer the funds to establish a new model of healthcare for rural communities.

The technique has to be endorsed by the Australian Resuscitation Council to be included in the first aid guidelines, but it has already been described by another expert as \u201ca fantastic life-saving idea\u201d.\nAustralian parents say the negative impact of the pandemic and prolonged lockdowns on the mental health of their children has worsened, and many struggle to access support, according to a survey by the Australian National University. \u201cSeeing my daughter suffer in her mind just breaks my heart,\u201d said one parent.\nThe Melbourne diocese of the Anglican church received almost $16m in jobkeeper subsidies in 2020, enough to clear its estimated sexual abuse compensation bill of $14.3m, accounts filed with the charities regulator show.\nLondon police have arrested a 38-year-old man on suspicion of killing Sabina Nessa, the 28-year-old primary school teacher from south-east London who is thought to have been murdered on the five-minute walk from her home to a nearby pub. Her death shocked the country, after the murders of Sarah Everard and the sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry this year, renewed the debate about the safety of women on the UK streets.\nThe US envoy to Haiti has resigned in protest at what he called the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cinhumane\u201d mass deportation of Haitian migrants and asylum seekers. His resignation is a serious blow for an administration that came to office promising a more humane approach to immigration after Donald Trump\u2019s policy of child separation.\nApple has opposed the EU plans to make a common USB-C charger port mandatory for all mobile phones, tablets and headphones in order to reduce electronic waste and save consumers\u2019 money.

Fluoridation of water can reduce this common problem.\n\u201cOn balance, there is strong scientific evidence that water fluoridation is an effective public health intervention for reducing the prevalence of tooth decay and improving dental health equality across the UK. It should be seen as a complementary strategy, not a substitute for other effective methods of increasing fluoride use.\u201d\nTooth decay is the biggest cause of hospitalisation for children aged from five to nine. In the 2019 school year, 23.4% of five-year-olds in England and 26.5% of four- to five-year-olds in Scotland had experienced damage to their teeth.\nLocal authorities are now responsible for deciding whether to add fluoride to local water supplies.\nThe health bill going before MPs will give Sajid Javid, the health secretary, the power to order fluoridation across the country. However, any move towards centralisation is not expected soon.\nJavid tweeted a link to the chief medical officer\u2019s conclusions and wrote: \u201cGood to see UK CMOs examining how water fluoridation can improve oral health & prevent tooth decay which disproportionately affects more deprived groups. Reinforces why our health and care bill will make it simpler to expand water fluoridation schemes.\u201d\nIn England, only 5.8 million people drink water with fluoride, some of which occurs naturally. It is more common in other countries including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Spain, South Korea and New Zealand.\nThe World Health Organization recommends a safe limit of about twice the levels that fluoridation schemes are likely to set. Whitty and his colleagues said that levels must be \u201cclosely monitored\u201d by drinking water inspectors.\nThe British Dental Association (BDA) welcomed the statement from the four UK chief medical officers. Eddie Crouch, the BDA chair, said: \u201cEvery dentist will thank the CMOs for recognising the lasting benefits water fluoridation could bring to the nation\u2019s oral health.\n\u201cHowever, these gains are purely theoretical without upfront investment. Spending here will pay for itself, and ministers need to show they are willing to seize the moment. We need a joined-up approach. Covid has left millions unable to access care, and deep inequalities are now set to widen.\u201d\nThe Oral Health Foundation said it fully supports the statement from the UK chief medical officers on the effectiveness of fluoridated water and how beneficial it can be in reducing tooth decay.\nThe argument over whether the mineral should be added to water supplies has been long running. In 2014, Public Health England urged councils in England to add fluoride to improve dental health.\nIn Australia, dentists and doctors in Queensland reported \u201cextensive tooth decay\u201d in 2019 in parts of the state that refuse to add fluoride to the water supply, especially among children and elderly people.\nIndigenous children, many of whom live in communities without fluoride, had a 70% rate of tooth decay. The rate was 55% among all Queensland children aged between five and 15.\nIn 2016, Australia\u2019s chief health and medical research agency said adding the mineral to drinking water does not lower a person\u2019s IQ, cause cancer or cause any other negative health effects after analysing more than 3,000 studies.",

But as the supporters began to stream out of the DW Stadium in the dying moments here, you felt the attention was not so much on the Rhinos\u2019 hopes of a ninth Super League title remaining alive, but the fact that, in truth, Wigan Warriors and their supporters had finally been put out of their misery in 2021.\nLeeds hadn\u2019t won in Wigan for eight years prior to this season. Since then, they have stopped the Warriors scoring twice in a matter of weeks, here in a manner that ultimately summed up one of the most forgettable seasons in the history of this great, proud rugby league club. Despite plenty of effort, the Warriors were bereft of creativity in attack at crucial junctures this year, and how that point was emphasised here.\nIn truth, any side that has failed to score five times in one season \u2013 four of those at home \u2013 has no right to be playing in a Grand Final. Leeds did enough to finally end any lingering doubt that Wigan could revitalise themselves for the play-offs, with Ash Handley\u2019s second-half try ultimately enough to secure a trip to either Catalans or St Helens in week two. They will have to improve next week, but here, they didn\u2019t really have to get out of second gear.\n\u201cRugby league is a game of inches,\u201d the Wigan coach, Adrian Lam said here as his time in charge ended with a whimper. But on too many occasions this year, Wigan have been miles, not inches, away from the best sides in the competition. \u201cWe were gutsy, but that\u2019s the way it ends sometimes. This club will always be great, and the group deserves a bit more than what they\u2019re feeling tonight.\u201d\nFor Wigan, attention will now turn to who succeeds Lam in 2022, and they have an almighty rebuild on their hands at the DW Stadium. But this was ultimately Leeds\u2019 night, as they kept alive their hopes of winning the Grand Final from fifth once again. The only side to win at Old Trafford after finishing that low in the Super League table, Handley\u2019s second-half try here proved to be the difference.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always defended well, and points are hard to come by here,\u201d Leeds\u2019 coach, Richard Agar, said. \u201cYou felt that would be the case again here. We\u2019ve not spoke about the past and winning it from fifth, but we\u2019ll get ourselves ready for another huge game next.\u201d Will Leeds have to improve to progress next week? Almost certainly. But here, you couldn\u2019t really argue with the final outcome.\nFollowing a first half with few clear-cut chances, you always felt the side that scored first after half-time would seize the initiative. That came as the hour mark approached when a Kruise Leeming kick found its way into the arms of Handley, who raced free to break the deadlock. Rhyse Martin converted, and any notion of a Wigan response was quickly dispelled as they huffed and puffed.\nBy the time Martin added a penalty to make it 8-0 in the final moments, many home supporters had already headed for the exits. Leeds live to fight another day, but for Wigan, there is a monumental winter ahead.",

That has got to come out of some people\u2019s pockets.\n\u201cThen I would just point out that the best solution is to continue to invest in people\u2019s skills, to make sure that they are getting the type of jobs that reward their hard work \u2013 and you\u2019re starting to see that, you\u2019re starting to see wages go up. And that\u2019s what we want to see.\u201d\nJohnson went on: \u201cWages are now rising faster than they have been for a long time, and the philosophy of this government is to try to deliver a high-wage, high-skill economy in which we invest in people, we invest in capital, we encourage businesses to put their profits back into people, back into the capital of the business, in order to drive productivity gain.\n\u201cAnd if you look at the UK since 2008, you look at our companies, they\u2019ve been paying very low wages and they\u2019ve been not investing, and productivity has fallen.\u201d\nAsked if his answer meant he could not live on \u00a3118 a week, Johnson replied: \u201cIt means that we want to support families in the best possible way.\u201d Pressed on the fact this could be seen as saying no by default, he responded only: \u201cThose are your words.\u201d\nCharities have warned the UC cut will push hundreds of thousands of people into poverty, exacerbated by rising energy costs. On Wednesday, the former prime minister Gordon Brown wrote in an article for the Guardian that the cut was the most \u201csocially divisive and morally indefensible\u201d he had witnessed in UK politics.\nOn Thursday it emerged that the Treasury is examining the possibility of tweaking the taper rate, under which wages below a low limit see UC payments docked in response, to allow people to keep more of what they earn.\n This article was amended on 24 September to clarify that \u00a3118 is the weekly rate of universal credit given to couples, not individuals.",

It has said that it has no connection to the leaked database that was investigated by the Pegasus Project and that the tens of thousands of numbers contained in the list are not the targets of NSO\u2019s government clients. It has also staunchly denied that Macron was ever targeted by Pegasus spyware.\nIn a statement released on Thursday night, NSO said: \u201cWe stand by our previous statements regarding French government officials. They are not and have\n never been Pegasus targets. We won\u2019t comment on anonymous source allegations.\u201d\nMediapart said the telephones of the ministers for education, territorial cohesion, agriculture, housing and overseas \u2013 respectively Jean-Michel Blanquer, Jacqueline Gourault, Julien Denormandie, Emmanuelle Wargon and S\u00e9bastien Lecornu \u2013 showed traces of the Pegasus malware.\nIt said not all the ministers were in their current posts at the time of the alleged targeting, which occurred in 2019 and, less frequently, in 2020, but all were ministers. The phone of one of Macron\u2019s diplomatic advisers at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace had also been targeted, it said.\nForensic analysis of their devices at the end of July had revealed the presence of \u201csuspect traces\u201d of the spyware, according to a report by French state intelligence services and a parallel criminal investigation by the Paris public prosecutor, it said.\nThe alleged victims, approached either directly or through their offices, had either not responded or said they did not wish to comment publicly on such a sensitive subject. Some referred Mediapart to France\u2019s secretariat-general for defence and national security (SGDSN), which also declined comment.\nThe \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace also said it would not comment on \u201clong and complex investigations which are still ongoing\u201d. At least one of the ministers has since changed both their telephone and phone number, Mediapart said.\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office has declined to comment on the progress of its investigation or to confirm whether or not it had uncovered the hacking of the ministers\u2019 phones, saying the inquiry was governed by rules of judicial secrecy.\nThe \u00c9lys\u00e9e has not commented on the Pegasus scandal since late July, when palace officials advised prudence, saying there was \u201cno certainty at this stage\u201d. Macron is, however, understood to have changed his phone number for some calls.\nThe French defence minister, Florence Parly, met her Israeli counterpart, Benny Gantz, in Paris in July and reportedly discussed the scandal, but no details of their conversation have leaked, Mediapart said.\nThe state secretary for European affairs, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, said in August that the \u201cgravity of the allegations\u201d and the ongoing judicial proceedings meant the government could say little. \u201cWe are still untangling the truth of the situation,\u201d he said.",

Almost a quarter (24%) of pupils in England said they felt unhappy about their schoolwork before the tests, compared with 28% for children elsewhere in the UK, and the figure did not change significantly at the time of the test.\nProf John Jerrim, one of the study\u2019s authors, said: \u201cThere is growing concern about the mental wellbeing of young people, including how this is related to national tests at school. However, the study found that happiness and wellbeing levels among children in England and the rest of the UK were very similar to one another and often overlapped.\n\u201cThe research also found there was little evidence to changes in wellbeing around the time of KS2 tests, or that children in England become happier, either in general or about school, once these tests are over.\n\u201cTaken together, these findings provide an important counter to conventional narratives about how the KS2 tests can have serious negative impacts upon children\u2019s wellbeing.\u201d\nThe peer-reviewed study, published in Assessment in Education, suggests that while Sats tests may be \u201chigh stakes\u201d for schools with results published in league tables, they are less so for the children who take them educational decisions about secondary school or the subjects they might study do not depend on their scores.\nJerrim said: \u201cThe tests play a fundamental role feeding into school accountability metrics and our findings suggest they should continue in their current form for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nBut teaching unions pointed out that the UCL findings were based on data going back to 2012 and therefore did not take into account a number of recent changes to primary assessment.\nKevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, which has campaigned for the abolition of Sats, said: \u201cUnfortunately, the researchers have drawn conclusions about the future of primary testing based on analysis of the regime almost 10 years ago.\n\u201cSince then, the curriculum has been radically changed in ways that many experts believed at the time was \u2018fatally flawed\u2019 and \u2018overly prescriptive\u2019 with subject content that was characterised as endless lists of spellings and rules.\u201d",

        "content": "Affric Highlands initiative to restore nature will involve tree planting, restoring peat bogs and connecting wildlife habitats\nA large swathe of the Scottish Highlands stretching between the west coast and Loch Ness is to be rewilded as part of a 30-year project to restore nature.\nThe Affric Highlands initiative aims to increase connected habitats and species diversity over an area of 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres), incorporating Kintail mountain range, and glens Cannich, Moriston and Shiel. Plans include planting trees, enhancing river corridors, restoring peat bogs and creating nature-friendly farming practices.\nThe project has been launched after two years of conversations and meetings between local communities and conservationists from rewilding charity Trees for Life. Similar to the WildEast project in East Anglia, it is a community-led effort to restore nature over a large area, which organisers hope will be a catalyst for social and economic regeneration.\n\u201cThis was once a much more peopled landscape that was rich with wildlife and we think we can find new ways to establish that connection again, today,\u201d said Alan McDonnell, a conservation manager at Trees for Life, and the project leader. \u201cThe idea of doing it at scale is that you get a much bigger natural response because you\u2019ve got room for change and dynamism in that landscape.\u201d\nThe Affric Highlands initiative is located west of the Cairngorms Connect project, which is one of the UK\u2019s largest land restoration projects at 60,000 hectares. In terms of total area, it is three times the size of Cairngorms Connect but at present only a quarter of the Affric Highlands area is managed by people who have signed up, including farmers, landowners and fishers. McDonnell hopes more will get involved once the project has launched.\nOne of the challenges has been bringing together people reliant on traditional land management practices to work on large-scale landscape restoration. McDonnell has had meetings with around 50 local stakeholders and has been working with a psychologist to help him communicate with people who might feel sceptical, and to allay the fears of damage to livelihoods that have accompanied other rewilding projects in the UK.\n\u201cRewilding is a word that people define differently. For some people, it\u2019s wolves and bears. For Trees for Life, it\u2019s about the land, and what it can support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re primarily motivated by the nature that will come with that, but that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t value everything that comes with it, so whether it\u2019s opportunities for businesses and job creation, or natural capital and the ability to monetise that, there are a lot of ways we can use land better and increase what it can offer.\u201d\nNative wildlife set to benefit includes a range of river species such as salmon, trout, ospreys and otters, as well as montane species such as golden eagles, red grouse, short-eared owls and mountain hares.\nRewilding Europe helped fund the work with a \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3250,000) grant and it will be the organisation\u2019s first UK project, one of nine across the continent. Other projects include Romania\u2019s southern Carpathians, Croatia\u2019s Velebit mountains, Italy\u2019s central Apennines and Bulgaria\u2019s Rhodope mountains.\nA \u00a3200,000 grant from the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation will help fund a two-year development period, during which time McDonnell will be recruiting three people to work on the project full-time. Practical work on the ground is set to begin in 2023.\nTrees for Life has already established 2 million trees as part of the restoration of the Caledonian Forest. In 2022, the charity expects to open its rewilding centre on the 4,000-hectare (10,000-acre) Dundreggan estate. The centre will have 40-bed accommodation, events spaces, classrooms and a cafe.\nMcDonnell said: \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time I would hope to see some significant changes happening \u2026 in particular I would love there to be more riverbank woodlands, which would increase insect life, help fish species and support richer river ecosystems. That might mean fencing off part of a landowner\u2019s riverbank, planting trees, or allowing natural regeneration.\u201d\nThe project also aims to help individuals get funding from government and other sources for green initiatives on their land, so people who sign up to it can financially benefit.\nFrans Schepers, managing director of Rewilding Europe, said: \u201cOur decision to accept the project as our ninth rewilding area reflects the hard work and achievements of Trees for Life, its volunteers and its partners. Including Affric Highlands in our portfolio of major European rewilding areas will help magnify rewilding\u2019s impact in the Highlands, and put it firmly on the global map.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\n The article was corrected on 24 September 2021.

He is going to be a nice, solid horse for next year.\n\u201cSomething like the Breeders\u2019 Cup we might look at, he has got plenty of experience under his belt now. We have got Albahr in there [in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf] who is a slightly different profile to him, but they are two hard-knocking sons of Dubawi and A, they won\u2019t look out of place and B, we will run all right over there.\u201d\nIt is nearly five months since Master Of The Seas was touched off in the 2,000 Guineas and Poetic Flare, who edged a short-head in front in the final stride, has franked the form several times since.\nCharlie Appleby\u2019s colt suffered a setback in training a few weeks later, however, and will line up for the Group Two Joel Stakes at Newmarket on Friday with only a few weeks left to salvage something from his three-year-old season.\nHis Classic form should be enough to send him off favourite but he may need to run close to it to win after 146 days on the sidelines, not least with the evergreen Benbatl (3.35) among his opponents.\nThe seven-year-old is closely matched with Master Of The Seas on ratings and put up one of the best performances of his career in this race two years ago, winning from the front under hands-and-heels for Oisin Murphy, who is back in his saddle on Friday.\nNewmarket 1.50 Dubai Love has not been out since finishing fourth in a Group Two at Meydan in February but she has several runs in the book that would make her a player at Listed level and makes her first start after a wind op here.\nYork 2.05 Mr Wagyu has gone from strength to strength this season and ran another fine race to finish third in last Saturday\u2019s Ayr Gold Cup. He is 1lb lower here and should face less competition for the lead, so a sixth handicap success of the current campaign is within reach.\nNewmarket 2.25 It would be unwise to take Albaflora\u2019s four-length second behind Snowfall in the Yorkshire Oaks too literally as the hot favourite won with plenty in hand but her comfortable success at Listed level at Ascot in May also reads well in the context of this Group Three assignment.\nYork 2.40 With 81 starts in seven years already in the form book, Firmament is not keeping anything back from the handicapper but he snapped a long losing run at Newcastle last time and saves his best for this track and trip. His latest win on the Knavesmire was off a mark of 93 and he is 7lb lower on Friday.\nHaydock Park\n1.00 Lockerbie\n1.30 Esha Meesh\n2.00 Buckshaw Village\n2.35 Sisters In The Sky\n3.10 Super Superjack\n3.45 Bandinelli\n4.20 Noble PatronNewmarket\n1.15 Spinaround\n1.50 Dubai Love\n2.25 Albaflora\n3.00 Romantic Time\n3.35 Benbatl (nb)\n4.10 Alignak\n4.40 FireworksYork\n2.05 Mr Wagyu (nap)\n2.40 Firmament\n3.15 Trust Bertie\n3.50 Cosmos Raj\n4.25 Emaraty Hero\n4.55 Hello Me\n5.25 TopanticipationWorcester\n2.17 Getabuck\n2.52 Supremely Lucky\n3.27 Blueue Away\n4.02 Calvinist\n4.35 Roque It\n5.07 Long CallNewcastle\n4.50 Miracle Eagle\n5.30 Fossos\n6.00 Twisted Dreams\n6.30 Cape Columbus\n7.00 Key Look\n7.30 Daany\n8.00 Musahaba\n8.30 Hail Sezer\nNewmarket 3.00 The last Rockfel winner to record a subsequent success was Promising Run, who took this Group Two in 2015, but this year\u2019s renewal looks to have plenty of strength in depth.

Its owners, a retired Danish couple who are not on the island, said they were \u201crelieved it\u2019s still standing\u201d, according to Ada Monnikendam, who built the house.\n\u201cWe all started crying like crazy when I told them [the owners] that their beloved house was intact,\u201d Monnikendam told El Mundo.\nThe house is in El Para\u00edso, where more than half of homes and the local school have been destroyed.\nThe couple chose La Palma specifically because of its volcanic landscape, Monnikendam told El Mundo. She said it was \u201csad to know that the house is there alone without anyone being able to take care of it\u201d.\nThe advance of lava on the island slowed significantly on Thursday, which raised fears that the molten rock might fan out further in the coming days and cause more destruction instead of just flowing out into the sea, Associated Press reported. \n One giant river of lava 600 metres (2,000ft) wide slowed to a speed of four metres (13ft) an hour after reaching a plain on Wednesday, officials said. On Monday, a day after the eruption on La Palma, it was moving at 700 metres (2,300ft) an hour.\n A second stream of lava has virtually ground to a halt, the head of the National Geographic Institute in the Canary Islands, Maria Jose Blanco, told a news conference.\n Blanco said seismic activity on La Palma island was now \u201clow\u201d but molten rock was still being thrown out of the volcano.\nAs it slowed, the lava grew thicker. In places, it rose up to 15 metres (50ft) high, authorities said. It now covers 166 hectares (410 acres) and has swallowed up around 350 homes.\nThe uncertainty has left many residents on the western side of the island of 85,000 people in limbo. Scientists say the lava flows could last for weeks or months.\nLa Palma witnessed its last eruption in 1971.\n\u2013 with Associated Press",

We will make sure that this message is out there on the 24th.\u201d\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world\u2019s carbon emissions must fall by half by 2030 to keep global heating below 1.5C, the limit countries agreed to strive for in 2015 in Paris.\nBut the UN reported on 17 September that current pledges from countries would lead to a 16% rise in the next decade.\nThere have been some positive moves in recent days, with China saying it will end its financing for highly polluting coal-fired power stations abroad \u2013 though not at home \u2013 and the US doubling its climate finance to vulnerable nations. This funding helps rich countries move towards delivery of the $100bn a year promised a decade ago, which is seen as critical for the success of COP26.\nBut Vanessa Nakate, a youth striker from the Rise Up Movement in Uganda, said: \u201cThe $100bn is the first step to correcting climate injustice. It was like countries finally looked up and saw the suffering and devastation that was going on in countries like mine because of the climate crisis. The most disturbing thing about this, though, is that it has not been delivered.\u201d\nProtesters in Mexico will assemble in front of the National Palace in Mexico City to demand that the state oil company Pemex presents a plan to decarbonise, while in Bangladesh activists will demand the scrapping of planned new coal and gas power stations. Demonstrations will also take place in 12 cities in South Africa, 64 towns and cities in Canada, at least 12 cities in Argentina, and in many other places.\n\u201cThe global north should be developing climate policies that have at their core climate justice and accountability to the most affected people and areas,\u201d said Valentina Ruas, from Brazil. \u201cInstead, they continue to exploit vulnerable communities and recklessly extract fossil fuel, while bragging about their insignificant emission reduction plans.\u201d.\nThe UK is the host of Cop26 and, in Parliament Square in London on Friday youth protesters will be joined by trade unions and environmental groups.\nElijah Mckenzie-Jackson said: \u201cWe know that another world is possible. Our government has the solutions and it has the money yet it is actively choosing not to act on climate but to prioritise the will of fossil fuel lobbyists.\u201d\nParent climate activists are also supporting the youth strikers. Ana Ancines, from Parents For Future Colombia, said \u201cAll parents need to unite to guarantee the young generation\u2019s future. In Latin America, we have to defend the Amazon, our natural reserves and water. I\u2019m concerned about my kids and your kids\u2019 future and this is why we are joining young climate activists.\u201d",

        "content": "Gabby Petito\u2019s case highlights the power of media attention but for Indigenous communities it also emphasizes the lack of attention given to missing and murdered Native people\nThe case of missing 22-year-old Gabby Petito came to a tragic conclusion this week when the FBI reported her body had been found in a national park in Wyoming. And just as they had been during the frantic search for the young woman, news organizations and social media platforms across the US were buzzing with the terrible update.\nThe saga highlighted the incredible power of media attention to showcase a missing person\u2019s case and help it reach some type of timely resolution, no matter how dire, though the search for Petito\u2019s killer continues. But for many in the Indigenous community, it also further emphasized the lack of attention and resources too often given to the scores of missing and murdered Native people in Wyoming and the rest of the country.\nIn a report released earlier this year, researchers found that between 2011 and September 2020, 710 Indigenous people were reported missing across Wyoming, and that between 2000 and 2020, Indigenous homicide victims accounted for 21% of all homicides, though they make up only 3% of the state\u2019s population\nDespite such staggering statistics, the report, a first of its kind for Wyoming, found that white homicide victims were more likely than Native people to receive media coverage. And when Native cases did receive media attention, articles were more likely to include violent language or portray them in a negative light, compared withstories about white victims.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the stories, talked with families that are sad and hurt that this is the way that their loved one was portrayed,\u201d said Emily Grant, senior research scientist at Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center, who led research on this report. \u201cBut it was heartbreaking to see the numbers and then to compare it to the stories about white victims, or white missing people, and see the discrepancy.\u201d\nOne of the cases featured in the report was that of Nicole Wagon, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe who has had to face the disappearance and death of two of her daughters in the last two years.\nOne of her daughters, Jocelyn Watt, 30, who Wagon described as a wonderful singer with a beautiful heart, was found shot to death in her home in central Wyoming at the beginning of 2019. Her murder has yet to be solved.\nA year later, Wagon filed a missing person\u2019s report for her younger daughter, Jade Wagon, 23, after she didn\u2019t return to their home on the Wind River Reservation. Weeks later, the body of her daughter, who she said was outdoorsy and would always make her laugh, was discovered in a field. Although law enforcement claimed she died from hypothermia and drugs, Nicole Wagon said she has no doubt she was murdered.\nDespite the family\u2019s tragedies, there was little public attention on either of their deaths.\n \u201cIt makes you feel like we don\u2019t matter; we\u2019re just a statistic,\u201d Wagon told the Guardian. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, my kids are not statistics. They were human beings. And they had lives. And regardless of what people may think, or assume, they don\u2019t know their stories.\u201d\n The epidemic of missing and murdered Native Americans extends far beyond Wyoming, reaching every corner of the US.\nIn April, the Department of Interior reported that about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native people were listed as missing in the National Crime Information Center, while thousands of other cases of murder and non-negligent homicide have been reported to the federal government\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n  That same month, Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, announced the formation of a new unit to investigate this problem. In a statement she described the violence against Native people as a \u201ccrisis that has been underfunded for decades\u201d.\nThis week, Haaland said she grieves for the Petito family, but that she also grieves for \u201cso many Indigenous women\u2033 whose families have endured similar heartache \u201cfor the last 500 years.\u2033\nIn 2008, the justice department reported that Native women on some tribal lands were murdered at more than 10 times the national average. And yet, too often their cases are overlooked or even outright ignored.\nCarolyn DeFord, founder of Missing and Murdered Native Americans, a national advocacy and outreach organization, said there is not even a missing poster for some of these Indigenous women, let alone media coverage.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the attention for ours? Where\u2019s the attention for Ruthie Fawn Kindness?... Rosalita Longee, where\u2019s her attention? She was a beautiful young Native woman, where\u2019s the FBI searches and the camera crew and the dog squad to find her?\u201d she asked.\nDeFord said she would like to see a \u201cconsistency in investigations and resources put out there\u201d for families. But at the bare minimum, she said, every family of a missing person should get a poster, their police report and a list of resources to help them, such as advocacy organizations, national missing databases and even news media to contact.\nTeri Deschene\u2019s daughter, Kiana Klomp, has been missing for a year and a half and she said not a single article had been written about her.\nThe 17-year-old, who she said liked to skateboard and go shopping, had run away from her home in Post Falls, Idaho, and had been staying with friends, but she ended up at a home with a man Deschene described as a sexual predator and later disappeared.\nDeschene, a member of the Tlingit Tribe, said for months she put up fliers all over the area and posted on social media, but when she tried to get her daughter\u2019s disappearance to a broader audience, she consistently came up short.\n\u201cAll I got in my pocket is Facebook, and just social media. That\u2019s all I got. I don\u2019t get any help from any other place. I begged. I just feel left out and unimportant,\u201d she said.\nVerna Volker, founder of Native Women Running and a missing and murdered Indigenous women activist in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said she started noticing the attention surrounding Petito\u2019s disappearance and decided to check on Ella Mae Begay, a Navajo Nation elder and master weaver missing since June. She said she found less than five stories on YouTube.\nBut, she said, Petito\u2019s case and the disparity it has showcased may have an impact on the situation.\n\u201cI think this tragedy actually opened more eyes of, \u2018wow, you know, this is happening to you women, we want to do better,\u2019\u201d said Volker.\nIn the last week, DeFord\u2019s Missing and Murdered Native Americans Instagram page has gained more than 1,000 new followers (she said it\u2019s unclear it\u2019s related to Petito\u2019s case or just a coincidence).\nAt the same time, Nicole Wagon, who is still waiting for answers to her daughters\u2019 deaths, said in recent days her family has suddenly been flooded by requests from the news media.\nShe said: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a blessing that the Petito case happened here, because all of this is shedding light to the state of Wyoming.\u201d",

Mansoor and Bindi have been happily married for 35 years but are now on the edge of failure. Mansoor has packed his oversized suitcase and is ready to abandon their life on this \u201ccold island\u201d and return to India for good. With his wife and friends reluctant to see him leave, the play unfolds into a manic frenzy that includes losing two cats in the airport and hiring a fake policewoman to search Mansoor\u2019s bags in a last-ditch attempt to convince him to change his plans.\nWith just two actors, Komal Amin and Maanuv Thiara, playing a total of 15 characters, at times things get confusing. At their best, the pair flit between varying personalities with confidence and ease. Amin has the knack of transforming her body from a stiff 53-year-old Bindi to a garishly confident perfume seller without a moment\u2019s pause. Thiara, too, impresses with his range \u2013 his interpretation of the extravagant lodger Akbar, who steals Mansoor\u2019s car and drives it to the airport without a licence, is one of the evening\u2019s highlights.\nBut, despite the pair\u2019s merits, the wide, open space of Oldham Coliseum\u2019s stage appears to overpower them. Even in the most touching moments, where they reimagine the early days of the couple\u2019s relationship with a first date at an Indian cinema, they look small on Hannah Sibai\u2019s largely blank set, made up of two portable airport-seat benches \u2013 and it is hard not to feel this is a missed opportunity.\nThe narrative, too, can at times feel cliched and unbelievable. Mansoor\u2019s true motive for travelling to India is not fully reasoned, and Bindi\u2019s reaction makes the couple\u2019s relationship feel one-sided and implausible.\nThough its focus on South Asian stories is welcome, Love N Stuff, directed by Gitika Buttoo, fails to explore them in any real depth. Mansoor and Bindi\u2019s life is lovable and laughable \u2013 but we are left waiting for this fragmented drama to really take off.\nAt Oldham Coliseum until 2 October. Then at Watford Palace Theatre, 5-9 October, and Sheffield Crucible, 13-16 October.",

        "content": "As sea levels rise, growers are employing innovative methods to adapt to saline soils\nLike millions of people across Bangladesh, Anita Bala, 45, relies on a small plot of land to feed her family.\nBut for years nothing would grow. Her husband farmed shrimp in the salty ponds on their land, but the surrounding ground was barren. Bala\u2019s efforts to cultivate beans and pulses failed repeatedly. Eventually she gave up.\nBala lives in a village in the southern coastal region of Patuakhali district, an area extremely vulnerable to flooding and cyclones, and her farming problems were a result of increased salinity in the soil. She is not alone. According to Dutch NGO Cordaid, 53% of coastal Bangladesh is affected by salinisation. By 2050, it is predicted that one in seven people in the country will be displaced by climate breakdown. The sea level is projected to rise by 50cm over the same period, leading to a loss of about 11% of Bangladesh\u2019s land.\nAs well as the natural disasters aggravated by the climate emergency, unsustainable shrimp farming compounds the problem, jeopardising the lives of those who rely on agriculture.\nBut the farmers of Patuakhali are adapting. Following the lead of an innovative Dutch farmer who discovered that some varieties of fruit and vegetables can grow \u2013 and thrive \u2013 in saline soil, ICCO (now part of Cordaid) began introducing farmers in the region to salt-tolerant crops. Its project, the Salt Solution, reached 5,000 small-scale farmers, including Bala, who said the technique has \u201crevolutionised\u201d her farming practices. Saline-tolerant seeds imported from the Netherlands were distributed, demonstration plots established and training in new planting methods given. Lead community farmers were identified to help spread the word.\nPotatoes, carrots, gourds, red beets, cabbages, Indian spinach, coriander and more have been harvested since the project began in 2017. The initiative aims to reach another 5,000 farmers by 2024.\nAbdul Aziz, 50, a farmer and one of the community leaders of the project, pointed towards his farmland in Kumirmara village, where he\u2019s harvesting bitter gourds and watermelons.\n\u201cI\u2019ve used raised beds to plant the seeds. Raised beds provide multiple benefits \u2013 the weed growth is reduced and the roots have an easier time growing. In between, trenches can be used for easy growing leafy plants. And before planting, we test the soil for the salinity level using a rapid test kit,\u201d said Aziz.\nIn the past the farmers had to take soil samples to a government-run laboratory many miles away, so ICCO introduced a saline testing kit that gives results in minutes and helps farmers decide which seeds to plant for maximum yield.\n\u201cSmallholder farmers all over the world will be hardest hit by the effects of climate change, such as this problem of salinisation. With this form of climate adaptation, we turn a growing problem into a sustainable solution. Instead of fighting the salt in the soil, we want salt-affected soil to be able to be used for agriculture again,\u201d said Masud Rana, from ICCO\u2019s agriculture division in Bangladesh.\nFour years on from the start of the project, ICCO has teamed up with private and public institutions to ensure the initiative is sustainable long term. Partners include Bangladesh Agricultural University, which is adding saline agriculture to its curriculum; and the Soil Resource Development Institute, which helps inform government policy. Bangladeshi seed company Lal Teer is developing commercially viable, affordable seeds to reduce reliance on imports.\n\u201cWe as an aid agency have certain limitations. If we can\u2019t ensure the logistics, the training and the skills of the farmers will go in vain,\u201d said Rana.\nIn the meantime, the Salt Solution project has helped improve the diets of thousands of farming families, as well as providing a source of income through the sale of excess crops.\n\u201cThe extra money means that I can pay for my son to go to high school now,\u201d said Bala.",

        "content": "Since 2015, the outgoing German chancellor has largely relied on a sole Hamburg designer for her wardrobe \nA four-storey house set a discreet distance away from Neuer Wall, Hamburg\u2019s luxury designer strip, holds the secrets to Angela Merkel\u2019s successful sartorial style.\nExcept that fashion designer Bettina Schoenbach, who has her studio here on ABC Strasse, has taken something of a vow of silence over her association with Merkel, who became her client after winning the 2005 election.\nOn her website, Schoenbach describes her philosophy. \u201cStyle is an expression of personal choices made many times over,\u201d she states, adding that she is \u201cdedicated to helping customers take strategic control of their image\u201d. It is a remark that could be straight out of the lexicon of the pragmatic Merkel. Thanks to Schoenbach, Merkel has throughout her chancellorship, now drawing to a close, been able to open her wardrobe daily and assemble her outfit with two or three flicks of the wrist: the dream of many a working woman.\nThe designer does not talk to the media, but that is probably how she has retained her role as the creator of Merkel\u2019s signature \u201cuniform\u201d, as it is often called: a jacket and a pair of dark-hued wide slacks, matched with a necklace, flat black shoes and a roomy Longchamp bag.\nMerkel set out with the aim of avoiding drawing attention to her outward appearance, and the trademark blazer did the job, not unlike a doctor\u2019s white coat. It is now synonymous with her political style: concrete, constant, without embellishment, but never dull. With a bell-like form, to fit what the late Karl Lagerfeld once referred to as her \u201cspecial proportions\u201d, the blazer typically has three or four buttons, always done up, and a round neckline, allowing space for the necklace. Sometimes with a collar and lapel, or pockets, sometimes without, Merkel is believed to have amassed several hundreds of the jackets over the years, in linen, silk, velvet and wool, mostly from Italian cloth, according to Germany\u2019s fashion press. They have come in all shades of the rainbow, from soft pastels to flaming purples and oranges, and were made for every season and occasion \u2013 the duller colours such as white and beige reportedly reserved for the less spectacular meetings with dark-suited business leaders. Lavender, it has been suggested, was worn ahead of difficult meetings, perhaps with the intention of contributing to a relaxed mood.\nIn one of the few remarks she has made about her style, Merkel told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in 2015: \u201cThere are occasions on which I have to wear dark colours, then sometimes I\u2019m informed that I will be standing in front of a white background, and for that the blazer has to have a lighter colour. And sometimes I\u2019m simply in the mood to wear something bright and colourful.\u201d\nShe has rarely worn patterns, and dresses were only ever seen when she made her annual trip to the opera in Bayreuth. The headlines that followed her appearance in 2008, when she wore a low-cut taffeta dress to the opening of Oslo\u2019s Opera House, are said to have irritated her so much that she never repeated the experiment. Her spokesperson was confronted the following morning with the question as to who had designed the distinctive creation, to which he sputtered the reply that it was a \u201cnew composition from her existing wardrobe\u201d (it was designed by Anna von Griesheim). In a 2013 TV debate, she wore a necklace in the colours of the German flag, which sparked such a heated debate about expressing national pride that she was never seen wearing it again.\nLike her wardrobe in the days before Schoenbach came along, Merkel\u2019s apparent lack of concern for her hair also drew scornful remarks early on, until a celebrity Berlin hairdresser taught how to blow-dry it, prompting the august Frankfurter Allgemeine to reveal the news that \u201cMerkel no longer leaves her hair to dry naturally; she blow-dries it\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the first time a chancellor\u2019s hair had made headlines. Merkel\u2019s predecessor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der dyed his, a media outlet dared to suggest, triggering a lawsuit from him and the forced withdrawal of the claim.\n\u201cI like the fact she has a recognisable style,\u201d Anna Wintour, the editor of US Vogue told German media recently. \u201cShe appears to me like someone who knows who she is. I don\u2019t have the impression she is trying to disguise herself.\u201d",

        "content": "After years of avoiding crime films, he\u2019s back as a mafioso in the Sopranos prequel The Many Saints of Newark. He talks about being adopted and getting into acting \u2013 and saves a surprise for the end \n\nI am a little trepidatious ahead of my interview with Ray Liotta because the reviews, shall we say, are mixed. Not about his acting, which has been accoladed and adored from his first major film role, as Melanie Griffith\u2019s crazy ex in 1986\u2019s Something Wild, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. No, the problematic reviews are about Liotta personally. One person who worked with him described him to me as \u201cthe rudest arsehole I ever met\u201d; another said he\u2019s \u201ca bit of a wildcard\u201d, and I suspect that the latter is a euphemism for the former.\nThis would explain a long-running movie mystery: why isn\u2019t he more successful?\u2019 It took Liotta, now 66, until he was 30 to bag Something Wild, but after that, movie stardom seemed assured. He went from there to starring opposite Tom Hulce in the little-remembered Dominick and Eugene, and then playing \u201cShoeless\u201d Joe Jackson in the extremely well-remembered Field of Dreams.\nAnd from there, he was cast as Henry Hill in Goodfellas, surely one of the greatest movie roles ever written for a young actor. Liotta was superb as the wannabe gangster, holding his own against that ultimate screen-chewer Joe Pesci, and at times acting Robert De Niro off the screen. And then \u2026 what? Well, he certainly didn\u2019t disappear. He was great as Johnny Depp\u2019s father in Blow, he memorably ate his own brain in Hannibal and I loved him in Cop Land, playing Sylvester Stallone\u2019s one true friend, and as Adam Driver\u2019s deranged divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. But he never became the leading man he seemed so destined to be in 1990, and no one could really explain why.\nAnyway, he\u2019s back, again, in a supporting role, and great, as usual. He\u2019s in The Many Saints of Newark, which is destined to forever be known as \u201cThe Sopranos Movie\u201d, and it is the best film I\u2019ve seen in I don\u2019t even know how long. The film focuses on young Tony\u2019s (played by James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael) relationship with Christopher Moltisanti\u2019s (Michael Imperioli on the show) father, Dickie, played here by Alessandro Nivola, in what is surely one of the performances of the year. Fathers and sons echo throughout the film and Liotta plays Dickie\u2019s father, Hollywood Dick Moltisanti. (Moltisanti = many saints. It took me an embarrassingly long time to put that together.)\nLiotta\u2019s role was greatly expanded once filming started, which is to the audience\u2019s benefit, because he is \u2013 as always \u2013 utterly magnetic in every scene. All of his scenes are with Nivola and, before I talk to Liotta, I ask Nivola what it was like acting opposite him. \u201cEven at rest,\u201d he says, \u201cRay seems like he has a boiling cauldron inside and you never know when it might erupt. That allows him to be a very understated performer and still convey power, humour and surprise effortlessly.\u201d\nSomeone else who worked with Liotta told me that the way to get Liotta talking is to flatter him, so when our phone interview begins, I tell him \u2013 sycophantically but honestly \u2013 that when he\u2019s on screen, even if he\u2019s just sitting still in a chair, he\u2019s all the audience can look at. Does Liotta think about his screen presence when he\u2019s acting? \u201cNah, not really. I just commit to what\u2019s written to me on the page and the script dictates the character,\u201d he says, sounding neither especially interested nor flattered.\nOne of the joys of seeing him in The Many Saints of Newark is that he gets to play the two extremes that his fans love best: the crazy manic Liotta (Something Wild, The Place Beyond the Pines, Marriage Story) and the more Zen Liotta (Field of Dreams, Blow). Which is more fun to play? \u201cAh, they\u2019re both fun,\u201d he shrugs.\nWhich is closer to what he\u2019s like normally? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Sometimes I\u2019m angry and hyper, like at traffic, and sometimes I\u2019m not. But my job is just to do what the script says,\u201d he replies.\nIn a recent interview, Nivola said that Liotta sent him a text saying that Nivola reminded him of himself in Goodfellas. \u201cIt was one of the most important accolades that I\u2019ve ever gotten from anybody, and it was really that kind of thing that gave me the confidence to take off in the performance,\u201d Nivola said.\nThat was kind of you, Ray, I say. \u201cMmm, I didn\u2019t mean it exactly like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was more in the sense of, he was the character that kept the piece together, like in Goodfellas the focus was on Henry. I just meant it like that.\u201d\nThis feels less like I\u2019m doing an interview and more like I\u2019m trying to strike up a conversation with a guy in a bar who\u2019s more interested in watching the TV over my shoulder. And so, in that spirit, I go to my usual bar conversation topic: The Sopranos. Was he a fan of the show? \u201cI\u2019m not much of a TV watcher, so every now and then I\u2019d put the TV on and if it was on, I\u2019d watch what they were doing. But it\u2019s just not how I was spending my time,\u201d he replies.\nI ask if that\u2019s because he was regretful that he \u2013 according to rumour \u2013 turned down the role of Tony Soprano. \u201cNo! I don\u2019t know where that story came from. David [Chase, creator of The Sopranos] once talked to me about playing Ralphie [eventually played by Joe Pantoliano]. But never Tony,\u201d he says.\nSo why did he say no? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do another mafia thing, and I was shooting Hannibal. It just didn\u2019t feel right at the time,\u201d he says.\nBut apparently The Many Saints of Newark felt extremely right, because when Liotta heard about it, he flew to New York to ask Chase for the role, paying for his own flights and accommodation (unheard of with most major actors). Why was he so keen to be in the film?\n\u201cI\u2019m really not sure what made me so determined,\u201d he says in the tone of a man who doesn\u2019t spend an enormous amount of time investigating his inner motives. \u201cBut I was and luckily it all worked out.\u201d\nFor as long as he could remember, Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. But for as long as Liotta could remember, he had no interest in acting at all. He only studied drama because it was a course at college that had no maths requirements, and he only started auditioning for plays because a pretty girl told him he should. \u201cTo be honest with you,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought I\u2019d be in construction.\u201d Liotta was adopted when he was six months old by an Italian-American couple and raised in New Jersey. He later tracked down his birth mother and discovered he had a clutch of half-siblings and a full sister. He\u2019s so associated with being Italian-American, did discovering his biological family change his self-image?\n\u201cNot really, no. The reality is, in terms of ethnicity, I have no idea what I am. I found out a lot of things from meeting my birth mother, but it didn\u2019t change anything. I just relaxed into [thinking]: \u2018This is the way my life turned out.\u2019\u201d\nLiotta\u2019s father convinced his son to give college a go, at least for a term, and it was there, at the University of Miami, that he started studying drama, and he got his first role in a play, as a dancing waiter in Cabaret. \u201cI\u2019m a jock from New Jersey, so it couldn\u2019t have felt further away from what I do,\u201d he hoots. Nonetheless, he enjoyed it so much he stayed at college for the full four years. Afterwards, he moved to New York where he got some advertising jobs, had a regular role in a soap opera and, eventually, was cast in Something Wild. And that was definitively the end of Liotta\u2019s hypothetical career in construction.\nLiotta knows he\u2019ll forever be known for Goodfellas, and he\u2019s fine with that. \u201cIf you got one movie that people remember, that\u2019s great. If you got two, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d he says. As it happens, he does have two, he just hasn\u2019t seen the second one. Is it really true he\u2019s never watched Field of Dreams? \u201cNope,\u201d he says firmly.\nBut Ray, I say, you\u2019re so good in it! So opaque, so weird, somehow so credible as the ghost of a disgraced baseball player. \u201cIt\u2019s just a personal thing that happened,\u201d he says with sudden real feeling. \u201cMy mom was sick when we went to see it, so we didn\u2019t stay the whole time so it\u2019s not something I want to do. It\u2019s on TV a lot, but I just pass over it. I\u2019ve no desire. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nDespite never seeing one of the greatest baseball movies ever made, Liotta is clearly not averse to the game itself, because he met his now ex-wife at a baseball game in 1997. They had one daughter, Karsen, and later divorced. Has his daughter seen Goodfellas?\n\u201cGood question. Have you seen it?\u201d he says, asking his daughter who is apparently sitting next to him. \u201cYeah, you showed it to me that time,\u201d she replies. \u201cOh yeah! We saw it at, believe it or not, the Aruba film festival,\u201d he says.\nAnd what did she make of it? \u201cWell, she wasn\u2019t into my voiceover so much. She was like: \u2018Oh Dad, will you shut up already?\u2019 Heh heh heh,\u201d he cackles.\nMartin Scorsese is known for using the same actors over and over, so why hasn\u2019t Liotta worked with him again? \u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask him. But I\u2019d love to,\u201d he says.\nMaybe Scorsese just hasn\u2019t found a part for Liotta that matches up to Henry. Or maybe it\u2019s to do with something else. I tell Liotta that when I interviewed Bruce Dern this year, he told me that when his daughter Laura was preparing to play Liotta\u2019s adversary in Marriage Story, she found out some \u201cnot cool stuff\u201d about him, such as instances of rudeness, and she thought about that when acting against him. Did he know about that?\n\u201cNah,\u201d he replies, totally unbothered. \u201cPeople use whatever they need to use to find the person in the part, and if she needed that, that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s all people telling stories, misinformation.\u201d\nI assume that Liotta must have his own extremely intricate acting methods. Even though he only fell into acting by chance, he then dedicated himself to it, and he continued to study with his beloved acting coach, Harry Mastrogeorge, even after Goodfellas. Nivola tells me that \u201cof all the scary legends I\u2019ve worked with \u2013 De Niro, Christopher Walken, Joaquin Phoenix, Shirley MacLaine \u2013 Ray is the one I was most intimidated by. Not because he\u2019s mean \u2013 he\u2019s not \u2013 but because he\u2019s so intensely committed to the art of acting.\u201d So maybe this is what people get wrong about Liotta: he\u2019s not rude, he\u2019s just acting. So go on, Ray, describe your art of acting.\n\u201cJust play pretend \u2013 that\u2019s pretty much it. The biggest thing is self-reliance: you don\u2019t need a director to tell you what to do, it\u2019s all in the script. If you simplify it, it sounds like make believe, but it is!\u201d he says.\nI feel a little like Ricky Gervais in Extras listening to Ian McKellen teach him how to act: \u201cHow do I know what to say? They had my lines written down on a script. How do I know where to stand? People showed me.\u201d And to be fair, I\u2019d rather that than him banging on about his craft, although it does leave certain questions about Liotta open.\nWe chat about what Liotta\u2019s been up to during lockdown: \u201cYou know, just living,\u201d he says. Then he suddenly drops into the conversation: \u201cAlso I\u2019m getting married.\u201d\nCongratulations, I say. \u201cThanks,\u201d he replies with a shrug.\nDid he propose during lockdown? \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get into that.\u201d\nIs he able to say who he\u2019s marrying? \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know her, and I don\u2019t like talking about this stuff,\u201d he says.\nAlas, our time is almost up so Liotta and I bid our farewells. It was definitely one of the odder phone calls I\u2019ve had in my life, but maybe Liotta saves his charisma for the screen. Only the truly talented can fake it so well.\n The Many Saints of Newark is in cinemas from today",

        "content": "Director David Lowery conjures up visual wonders and metaphysical mysteries from the anonymously authored 14th-century chivalric poem\nChrist\u2019s sacrifice and the erotic death-wish of earthly glory: these are the components of this freaky folk horror from writer-director David Lowery, a mysterious and sensationally beautiful film inspired by the 14th-century chivalric poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which was written by an anonymous contemporary of Chaucer. Its creator\u2019s identity remains a puzzle to the present day \u2013 though the film playfully hints at the question of authorship.\nThe story could not be more simple or more perplexing: a nobleman at the court of King Arthur is challenged by a stranger to a martial contest on Christmas Day. But the contest utterly negates or deconstructs the whole idea of manly valour, strength, courage and skill in battle. All that is required is submission.\nIn this film adaptation, Dev Patel plays Gawain, whom Lowery imagines almost as a kind of Prince Hal figure, a dissolute wastrel woken in some place of ill-repute with a mug of beer in the face from his lover Essel (Alicia Vikander) with a cheeky cry of \u201cChrist is born!\u201d. It is Christmas Day, and Gawain is required to attend the court presided over by Arthur and Guinevere: charismatic and cadaverous performances from Sean Harris and Kate Dickie. It is the king\u2019s caprice to require of one of his attendants some tale to amuse the company \u2013 and as if in answer to this request, a gigantic stranger strides through the door, a knight all in green, begging the king to be allowed to take on one of his attendants in a certain \u201cChristmas game\u201d.\nThe Green Knight simply presents his unprotected neck to Gawain and tells him to take a free shot with his sword. But in 12 months\u2019 time, Gawain must present himself at the Green Chapel and allow the Knight to take his own swing at Gawain\u2019s defenceless flesh. Stunned by the strangeness of the demand, and by the honour of carrying it out in front of the king, Gawain chops the Green Knight\u2019s head off \u2013 and the knight simply picks his head up and strides away. Now Gawain must confront his own destiny. Will he also be saved from death by some divine grace? Will the relinquishing of self bring about some enigmatic renewal? Or has he somehow failed in such a way as to be punished with this black mass of humiliation?\nAnd so Gawain is to go on an extraordinary quest across a stunningly rendered landscape towards the Green Chapel, shot by cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo, to the accompaniment of haunting compositions and arrangements by Daniel Hart. Like a haunted pilgrim in something by Bergman, Gawain is to come across strangers whose own intentions are sinister. Barry Keoghan is a malign scavenger who tells Gawain he is in the Green Chapel right now (like Mephistopheles telling Marlowe\u2019s Faustus he is already in hell); Erin Kellyman is the spirit of Saint Winifred, whose own decapitation made her a Christian martyr; finally Gawain is to lodge with a certain lord and lady, played by Joel Edgerton and Alicia Vikander (an eerie doppelganger of the lowborn woman he has left behind), who startle him with what appears to be a taste for medieval swinging.\nThere is a sensational speech from the lady of the castle about the meaning of green: the colour of nature, the colour of remorseless amoral growth, the grass that will grow out of the grave and the moss that will cover the tomb, the endless process that will make a mockery of individual heroes and their paths of glory. And there is a stunning sequence in which Gawain is robbed and bound by the scavenger and his accomplices, left to die, to rot down to his bones but then to be born again, a rebirth that happens within the blink of an eye, or within the victim\u2019s mind, or in metaphysical parallel with his ignominious roadside death.\nGawain is being tested. So are we. The visual brilliance of this film combines with shroomy toxicity and inexplicable moral grandeur: what a stunning experience.\n The Green Knight is released on 24 September in cinemas and on Amazon Prime Video.",

We will move heaven and earth to do whatever it takes to make sure shortages are alleviated with HGV drivers.\u201d\nAsked about the Petrol Retailers Association warning that drivers should keep a quarter of a tank of fuel in their car in case forecourts ran out, Shapps downplayed the issue and said motorists should \u201ccarry on as normal\u201d and not panic-buy.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying there is no issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an issue. Although there are stresses and strains in the system, by and large it has not impacted on people\u2019s everyday life when it comes to filling up with petrol. There is not a shortage of fuel at the refineries.\u201d\nShapps blamed Covid-19, which he said delayed 40,000 drivers taking their HGV driving tests but added that the government had changed the law to ease the \u201cbottleneck\u201d. More than twice as many driver tests were now available than pre-Covid, he said.\nShapps said the driver shortage was not a new problem and that the UK had relied over a long period of time on \u201cimporting cheap European, often eastern European, labour undercutting the domestic market\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe need to make this a more attractive industry\u201d, welcoming salary and wage increases for HGV drivers.\nAsked about the role of Brexit in the driver crisis, he said EU countries such as Poland and Germany had \u201cvery large and even larger\u201d shortages.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people point to Brexit as the culprit here; in fact, they are wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of Brexit, I\u2019ve been able to change the law and alter the way our driving tests are taken in a way I could not have done if we were still part of the EU. Brexit has actually provided part of the solution.\u201d",

        "content": "There are moments of dreamlike brilliance in this extravagant fable of imperialism \u2013 provided you can stay awake to see them\nWith Denis Villeneuve\u2019s new adaptation of Dune almost upon us, here is a chance to revisit David Lynch\u2019s ill-starred attempt from 1984: the version of Frank Herbert\u2019s classic sci-fi novel he wrote and directed under the aegis of producer Dino De Laurentiis. At the time, it was greeted with a bored shrug from both press and public, making it a rare failure for Lynch. It would be agreeably contrarian to claim that Lynch\u2019s Dune is an underrated masterpiece \u2013 but it isn\u2019t exactly. There are, admittedly, some moments of expressionist panache and dreamlike strangeness; it sometimes feels like a freewheeling sci-fi production of a lost Shakespeare Roman play. There\u2019s a wonderful scene when the mighty sandworm on the planet Arrakis is tamed and mastered, which Villeneuve hasn\u2019t yet offered us.\nBut there are also a lot of longueurs, a lack of dramatic focus, and simply an attempt to do too much, encompassing and transforming the entire book in just over two hours. (Villeneuve, by contrast, is covering less than half with his version.) The passing of time can be very unforgiving for visual effects, and Lynch\u2019s Dune doesn\u2019t look as good as, say, Kubrick\u2019s 2001, which was made long before. It\u2019s closer in design to Mike Hodges\u2019s intergalactic comic-book comedy Flash Gordon from 1980, which was supposed to be funny, although that also had Max von Sydow in it.\nIn this Dune, Kyle MacLachlan plays Paul Atreides, the young aristocrat from a noble house ordered by the emperor to take up what amounts to a colonial governorship on the harsh planet of Arrakis, or \u201cDune\u201d, a place of huge strategic importance. This is where a substance called melange, which endows the consumer with enormous power, is mined. But the planet has an indigenous people who are on the point of rising up against their imperial oppressors \u2013 there is talk of holy war \u2013 and a terrifying and possibly phallic sandworm that churns the desert landscape. Paul\u2019s mother, Jessica (Francesca Annis), is the initiate of an occult sisterhood that cultivates supernatural powers of the mind and awaits the arrival of a messiah. Jessica is subordinate to a terrifying reverend-mother figure, nicely played by Si\u00e2n Phillips, who forces Paul to undergo a disturbing initiation ceremony with a box. And as war between the house of Atreides and the various duplicitous families breaks out, Paul falls in love with Chani (Sean Young) and confronts his own messianic destiny.\nIt is a movie that starts out as if it were going to reinvent Lawrence of Arabia in those eerily rippling sands, and there\u2019s a coolly delivered prologue from Virginia Madsen as the emperor\u2019s daughter Princess Irulan, putting us in the picture about the geopolitics of it all, with her face swimming weirdly in and out of focus. There are intriguing supporting performances from Phillips, from Von Sydow as a scientist on the planet and from Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as the dignified emperor himself. But this is a film that doesn\u2019t dramatically harness the vast forces it\u2019s gesturing at, but trundles determinedly along with very little variation of tone or pace.\n Dune is released on September 24 in cinemas.",

Plus: the right to clean air\nGood morning.\nThe House select committee scrutinizing the Capitol attack has subpoenaed Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mark Meadows along with three of the former president\u2019s top aides.\nThe development is the most aggressive action the panel has taken since it made an array of records demands and records preservation requests last month. The advisers in question have valuable information about what Trump was doing and thinking during the insurrection.\nWho was subpoenaed? Alongside Meadows, three of Trump\u2019s closest aides have been summoned: the deputy White House chief of staff Dan Scavino, the former campaign manager Steve Bannon, and the former acting defense secretary\u2019s chief of staff Kash Patel.\nWhat will they be asked for? The select committee will seek documents and deposition testimonies about the Capitol attack, as well as other matters deemed relevant to the inquiry.\nWhat\u2019s next? The select committee is expected to authorize further subpoenas and schedule closed-door interviews with key witnesses, as well as the inquiry\u2019s second public hearing.\nGabby Petito\u2019s boyfriend has been charged with unauthorised use of a bank card use as the manhunt for 23-year-old continues.\nA warrant has been issued for Brian Laundrie\u2019s arrest after a federal grand jury indicted him for illegal use of a Capital One Bank card and someone\u2019s personal identification number.\nWhat does the arrest warrant mean for the search? The warrant will allow law enforcement across the US to continue searching for Laundrie while the homicide investigation proceeds.\nWho did the debit card belong to? We don\u2019t know whose card it is or the nature of the charges. Laundrie has been indicted for allegedly using it to make unauthorized withdrawals or charges worth more than $1,000 during the time in which Petito went missing.\nCalifornia will become the first state to collect information about gender identity and sexual orientation in cases of violent deaths in an attempt to tackle the disproportionate risk of violence faced by LGBTQ+ people.\nThe governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a bill into law creating a three-year pilot program to gather such data on violent deaths. \u201cWe only know how best to address these important issues when we have the data,\u201d Newsom said.\nHow much greater is the risk? LGBTQ+ people are almost four times more likely to be victims of violent crime, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault, according to a UCLA study.\nWhere will program be implemented? The law will establish a pilot program in up to six counties. Santa Clara, Los Angeles, Stanislaus and Fresno have agreed to participate.\nThe Taliban will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, Afghanistan\u2019s new prisons minister and Taliban veteran, Nooruddin Turabi, has said, describing amputations as \u201cnecessary for security\u201d.\nYouth activists will stage their first global climate strike since the onset of the pandemic on Friday, weeks before the vital Cop26 climate summit.\nThe governor of Alaska has activated crisis standards of care as health systems hit a breaking point in the state with the highest rate of Covid.\nDelivery workers in New York City have won a raft of new rights after lawmakers passed bills setting minimum pay, allowing workers to keep more of their tips, limiting journeys and ensuring access to bathrooms.\nArchaeologists believe they have uncovered the oldest known human footprints in North America, with tracks at the White Sands national park in New Mexico estimated to be between 21,000 and 23,000 years old. The discovery has been hailed as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d, as most scientists previously believed that the earliest appearance of humans in the Americas was 11,000 to 13,000 years ago.\nWith all eyes on the Gabby Petito case, many in the Indigenous community have felt a chasm between the way the media has approached the search for her killer and the lack of attention given to the scores of missing and murdered Native people. Although only 3% of Wyoming\u2019s population is Indigenous, Native American victims accounted for 21% of all homicides between 2000 and 2020, a report found. Despite this, white victims were more likely to receive media coverage.\nAmid a flurry of air pollution cases brought against the UK government and a related upcoming vote on New York\u2019s state constitution, Dr Gary Fuller asks whether this piecemeal approach could be replaced with a right to clean air.

        "content": "Nooruddin Turabi, in charge of Afghan prisons, says executions and removal of hands will restart, but possibly not in public\nThe Taliban will resume executions and the amputation of hands for criminals they convict, in a return to their harsh version of Islamic justice.\nAccording to a senior official \u2013 a veteran leader of the hardline Islamist group who was in charge of justice during its previous period in power \u2013 executions would not necessarily take place in public as they did before.\nThe Taliban\u2019s first period ruling Afghanistan during the 1990s, before they were toppled by a US-led invasion in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks, was marked by the grisly excesses of its perfunctory justice system, which included public executions in the football stadium in Kabul.\nIn an interview with Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi \u2013 who was justice minister and head of the so-called ministry of propagation of virtue and prevention of vice during the Taliban\u2019s previous rule \u2013 dismissed outrage over the Taliban\u2019s executions in the past, and warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan\u2019s new rulers.\nUnder the new Taliban government, Turabi is in charge of prisons. He is among a number of Taliban leaders, including members of the all-male interim cabinet, who are on a United Nations sanctions list.\n\u201cEveryone criticised us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,\u201d Turabi said in Kabul. \u201cNo one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Qur\u2019an.\u201d\n\u201cCutting off of hands is very necessary for security,\u201d Turabi added, saying it had a deterrent effect. He said the cabinet was studying whether to carry out punishments in public and would \u201cdevelop a policy\u201d.\nTurabi\u2019s comments follow warnings from Afghans who fled the country following the US withdrawal that the Taliban\u2019s system of justice was more likely to follow the model of the way its \u201cshadow courts\u201d meted out punishments in areas it controlled, rather than the system that operated under the western-backed former government.\nThe shadow court system, headed by Mawlavi Abdul Hakim Sharie, who is the Taliban\u2019s new justice minister, was used to undermine the authority of the previous regime, resolving disputes in a country where many felt they had little access to legal remedy.\nA report by Human Rights Watch in 2020 suggested, however, abuses by the Taliban justice system including \u201cprolonged arbitrary detention and summary punishments, including executions\u201d.\n\u201cWhile public punishment for infractions is infrequent compared to the 1990s for offences deemed more serious,\u201d the report continued, \u201cTaliban officials have imprisoned residents and inflicted corporal punishments such as beatings.\u201d\nSince the Taliban overran Kabul on 15 August and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will recreate their harsh rule of the late 1990s.\nAt that time, the world denounced the Taliban\u2019s punishments, which took place in Kabul\u2019s sports stadium or on the grounds of the sprawling Eid Gah mosque, often attended by hundreds of Afghan men.\nExecutions of convicted murderers were usually by a single shot to the head, carried out by the victim\u2019s family, who had the option of accepting \u201cblood money\u201d and allowing the culprit to live.\nFor convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of a hand. For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.\nTrials and convictions were rarely public and the judiciary was weighted in favour of Islamic clerics, whose knowledge of the law was limited to religious injunctions.\nTurabi said that this time, judges \u2013 including women \u2013 would adjudicate on cases, but the foundation of Afghanistan\u2019s laws would be the Qur\u2019an. He said the same punishments would be revived.\nTaliban fighters have already revived a punishment they commonly used in the past: public shaming of men accused of small-time theft.\nOn at least two occasions in Kabul in the past week, men accused of petty theft have been packed into the back of a pickup truck, their hands tied, and paraded around for their humiliation.\nIn one case, their faces were painted to identify them as thieves. In the other, stale bread was hung from their necks or stuffed in their mouth. It was not immediately clear what their crimes were.\nDuring the previous Taliban rule, Turabi was one of the group\u2019s most ferocious and uncompromising enforcers. When the Taliban took power in 1996, one of his first acts was to scream at a female journalist, demanding she leave a room of men, and to then deal a powerful slap in the face of a man who objected.\nDespite the comments on justice, Turabi tried to insist that the current iteration of the Taliban was different, saying that the group would allow television, mobile phones, photos and video \u201cbecause this is the necessity of the people, and we are serious about it\u201d.",

We\u2019re working through those with the commonwealth, but that\u2019s not a particular issue that will stop us getting to 80% as soon as we possibly can.\u201d\nThe Moderna doses will be targeted at areas with ongoing clusters including the Palm Plaza pop-up in Dandenong and a number of sites in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, in partnership with Monash Health.\nModerna, an mRNA vaccine, was made available at community pharmacies in the state for anyone aged between 12 and 59 earlier this week.\nThere were 733 locally acquired cases reported on Friday, and one further death \u2013 a woman in her 80s from Moreland.\nIt was not reported how many cases were linked to current outbreaks or were in isolation throughout their infectious period.\nThe number was slightly lower than a record 766 cases recorded on Thursday, as the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, warned Victorians against breaching restrictions on AFL grand final day.\n\u201cVictoria deserves to enjoy the day and I hope everyone will. But there is a curfew in place in much of Victoria,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see crowds \u2026 down at the paddock after the match or on Sunday either in celebration or commiseration. It is those close contacts that put you, your friends and your households at risk.\n\u201cEnjoy your fancy cheese boards or whatever way you want to enjoy it at home. Put the barbecue on, but put your iPad up, have your phones on FaceTime, cry and scream and laugh and joke over the internet \u2026 but remember \u2026 transmissions are occurring in households.\u201d\nThe northern suburbs continue to bear the brunt of the current Delta outbreak, with more than half of Friday\u2019s cases detected in the region, including 243 in Hume.\nThere were 27 new cases detected in Victoria\u2019s regions, including one case in Ballarat which may have been infectious in the community.\nIt comes as Victoria police confirmed they arrested 215 people on the fifth day of unrest in Melbourne\u2019s CBD and inner-north.\nThere were 31 people arrested in the inner-northern suburb of Northcote. Police said a group of \u201cup to 80 demonstrators attended at a park on Separation Street and a nearby shopping centre this afternoon,\u201d in breach of public health orders.\nIn a statement, police said they moved quickly to respond to protesters at various locations.\n\u201cPolice are disappointed to see the number of people who are continuing to breach the chief health officer\u2019s (CHO) directions and remind those people that we will not tolerate their behaviour and will continue to arrest and fine them if they are found to be in breach of the CHO directions.\u201d\nSome officers have been told to get tested and isolate after being found to be close contacts of a Covid-positive person that attended the protests on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, it was confirmed a protester who was in the Melbourne CBD on Wednesday had since tested positive for Covid-19 and was being treated in hospital.\nFoley said whether the protests would become \u201csuperspreader\u201d events would become clear in the coming fortnight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seen the behaviour of these so-called freedom fighters degenerate to the point they\u2019re so brave and strong they abuse vaccine centre workers who are out there supporting the most vulnerable in our community,\u201d Foley said.\n\u201cThose people are unrepresentative. The people who are representative of Australia and our best shared values are those people who are going out and getting vaccinated at record levels.\u201d\nSutton dismissed the protestors as a \u201chodge-podge\u201d living in a \u201cfantasy world\u201d who thought \u201ceverything will be solved by taking a horse deworming tablet\u201d.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend these are otherwise rational individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely wacky.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen sentiment within the construction industry that\u2019s very pro-vaccine.

But recent promises of additional cash from the US, the EU and others have lifted the prospects.\n\u201cI think that we will probably hit the $100bn for next year,\u201d said Lord Stern, the chair of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at the London School of Economics, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cWe could start to get bilateral flows [from donor countries to poor nations] approaching $50bn to $60bn because if the US came up then others would come up as well. The finance which went to the fossil fuels, which the G7 agreed to phase out quickly, could be reoriented towards renewables.\u201d\nHe predicted that the global publicly funded development banks, such as the World Bank \u2013 where he served as chief economist from 2000 to 2003 \u2013 would also step up their efforts at a series of meetings next month. \u201cThey [the development banks] will be increasing their volumes and they will be increasing the proportions focused on climate. So my own view is we must push very hard to get the $100bn, it\u2019s not going to be this year so it should be next year, and I think it could well be.\u201d\nJoe Biden, the US president, pledged at the UN general assembly on Tuesday that the US would double its climate finance, to $11.4bn a year by 2025.\nChina also pledged at UNGA to stop funding the development of new coal-fired power plants overseas, a significant move as China was the only major player still intending to fund new plants in poorer developing nations. At least 54 gigawatts of China-backed coal power projects, which are in active development but not yet under construction, could be affected by the pledge from China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\u201cThose events are positive, and key parts of what we have said we were looking for [at Cop26],\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe have been looking for these movements from the US and China for some time, and they constitute really positive developments. Of course, we need to do much more in terms of finance \u2013 bilateral, multilateral and private \u2013 and for China to start reducing coal strongly at home.\u201d\nStern, who in 2006 led a landmark review of the economics of climate change that proved conclusively that cutting greenhouse gas emissions would be a fraction of the cost of climate breakdown, has been serving on a high-level advisory panel to the UK government on Cop26.\nThe issue of climate finance \u2013 cash for poor countries to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather \u2013 has weighed heavily on the summit. A report by the OECD confirmed just over a week ago what previous indicative assessments had found, that climate finance in 2019 reached only about $80bn, well short of the target.\nDeveloping countries, which tend to be more vulnerable than the rich world to the impacts of climate breakdown, have viewed the missed target as a betrayal of trust from the rich world, which has contributed most to the climate crisis.\nBut Stern said countries must look beyond the totemic $100bn target, which was promised to continue annually to 2025, and further ahead to the prospects for finance in the second half of this decade. Private sector funding could play a much greater role then, he predicted.\n\u201cMy instincts now are not to get focused only on the $100bn,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we should be looking for is financial packages with very strong leverage rather than one aggregate number. [We should be] looking for big private-sector multipliers.\u201d\nMore funding should also be directed towards helping poor countries adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, he added. At present, the bulk of climate finance flows to middle-income developing countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions. But many such projects, such as windfarms or solar panels, provide a financial return and could be profitable in any case. Far harder to finance are projects that protect people and their livelihoods but do not turn a profit.\nStern said that recognising the value of adaptation was more important than a strict division of funds. \u201cRaising the profile of resilience and adaptation [is important], and I think there will be progress on that, but rather than saying 50% should be mitigation [reducing emissions] and 50% should be adaptation in finance, I would rather say there should be a strong component of resilience in climate finance and climate action,\u201d he said.\nThe UN security council also met at UNGA this week to warn global governments that the climate crisis was increasingly a question of national security. Michael Martin, the taoiseach, who led the discussions as Ireland holds the revolving presidency of the security council, said: \u201cThe impact of climate change is global and our collective security is at risk. We have seen how climate change is already contributing to conflict in many parts of the world. From the Sahel to Iraq, this council has recognised that climate change is one of the factors driving conflict and fragility.\u201d\nBoris Johnson, the British prime minister, used his speech at UNGA to urge global leaders to redouble their efforts at Cop26. He repeated his mantra of \u201ccash, coal, cars and trees\u201d, emphasising that climate finance is a key aim for the UK hosts at the summit.\nInvoking Sophocles and Kermit the Frog in a wide-ranging speech, Johnson compared the world to a rowdy teenager that had begun to indulge in \u201call sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal \u2026 It is time for humanity to grow up.\u201d\nMary Robinson, former president of Ireland, said: \u201cI got a little irritated. If the UK itself would only grow up \u2013 stop the coal plant in Cumbria, not operate Cambo [oilfield], and restore aid to 0.7% of GDP, that would be leadership.\u201d\nBut she conceded: \u201cHe does have the capacity to galvanise attention, and at least it is attention of the right kind, rather than being Trump-like on the wrong side.\u201d",

        "content": "Analysis: the west tried to impose its alien values and it is time to try a new approach, as Joe Biden has indicated\nSome years ago, in Afghanistan, the anthropologist Scott Atran asked a Taliban fighter what it would take to stop the fighting, because families on both sides were crying. The fighter replied: \u201cLeave our country and the crying will stop.\u201d\nThe crying may not have stopped, but the Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan without an air force, heavy arms or expensive training, against US-backed Afghan government forces that outnumbered them four to one. In doing so, they have taken an important step closer to realising their stated goal, which is the creation of an Islamic emirate governed according to their interpretation of sharia law.\nFor decades, Atran, who holds academic posts in the UK, US and France, has been trying to understand what it is that makes ordinary people willing to fight to the death. He concludes that it is sacred values \u2013 values that may be religious or secular, such as God or country, but that are always non-negotiable, meaning they cannot be abandoned or exchanged for material gain.\nSacred values, according to Atran, are the reason that since the second world war, revolutionaries and insurgents have frequently triumphed over state armies and police forces that boast up to 10 times their personnel and firepower. Ultimately, the negotiable things that motivate such armies, such as pay and promotion, are no match for the sacred.\nThe surprise is no longer that this happens, but that western governments have failed to learn it \u2013 at great cost to the populations they represent. \u201cIt is sad to reflect that, after four recent wars, Britain has suffered, in effect, four defeats,\u201d says Rob Johnson, who directs the Changing Character of War Centre at the University of Oxford. \u201cThis must surely beg the question: who has presided over such a dreadful track record?\u201d\nThe blame, Atran suspects, lies less with individuals than with the democratic institutions that western governments often seek to export. These favour responses whose costs and benefits can be quantified, that fit the relatively short time horizons imposed by elections and institutional turnover, and that assume all opponents are \u201crational actors\u201d who will negotiate and compromise: \u201ceverything the sacred and spiritual aren\u2019t\u201d, he says.\nThis mismatch of mindsets, along with politicians\u2019 tendency to persist with an inappropriate response, rather than change tack and admit that lives and money were lost in vain \u2013 what economists call the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d \u2013 has resulted in the Taliban\u2019s victory, he believes.\nThe group of academics who have ventured to the frontline to ask fighters what brought them there is understandably small. Atran is one of them, having done fieldwork in Iraq and Afghanistan. Another is the University of Oxford anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse, who has quizzed Libyan rebels, British special forces and tribal warriors in Papua New Guinea.\nAtran and Whitehouse actually disagree about the primary motives driving these fighters. Sacred values are important, says Whitehouse, but more important is group belonging \u2013 a visceral sense of oneness with others that often comes about through shared suffering, and that can be strengthened when the group is confronted by an external threat.\nHis research suggests that, when push comes to shove, fighting comrades will abandon their values before they abandon each other; Atran finds the opposite. The two models have different implications in terms of how outsiders might engage with such groups, but Atran and Whitehouse agree that treating those groups as rational actors does not work. It was to try to persuade western governments that in many conflicts they are dealing with a different phenomenon, \u201cdevoted actors\u201d, that in 2013 they and others created the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict (CRIC) at Oxford.\nEight years on, the message still has not got through. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, we keep being invited [to meetings] yet it all seems to go in one ear and out the other,\u201d says Atran, who has briefed at the highest levels of the US government.\nAshley Jackson, the Oslo-based co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute, and author of a recent book, Negotiating Survival, based on hundreds of interviews with Afghans, has had a similar experience. In government circles, she says, people are often aware that a given, usually military response is not working, but they are not prepared to discuss alternatives. \u201cThe mindset is \u2018you\u2019re either with us or against us\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no middle ground.\u201d\nOne problem, according to CRIC\u2019s founders, is a lack of self-awareness in western societies about the values they themselves hold sacred. They want to export democracy and its many advantages, which include a greater potential to generate wealth than non-democratic societies, but they seem to forget that democracy is a relatively recent invention of nation states. It took time to achieve, it is not perfect even where it prevails, and it is in retreat in many places. A recent poll showed that one in four Americans would prefer an authoritarian system of government, and the level of dissatisfaction is similar in the UK.\nLacking a firm grasp of their own values, westerners often have an even shakier grasp of the opposition\u2019s. In the case of Iraq, the US Congress commissioned research from private companies that indicated that most Iraqis wanted democracy. \u201cWhen we did our studies, on the frontline and in the region, it was exactly the opposite,\u201d Atran says. \u201cWe got 2% support for democracy.\u201d Democracy has never yet been successfully imposed on tribal societies, he adds, which is not to say that such societies could not one day choose to adopt it.\nRichard Davis, another CRIC co-founder, who directed terrorism prevention policy under President George W Bush, has a different interpretation. He says that people in government and the military want to understand the cultures they are fighting, which is why the US Department of Defense funds the Minerva Research Initiative for social science \u2013 albeit with a tiny fraction of its budget. The problem, Davis says, has been in the implementation. Governments lack models for how to engage with devoted actors.\nAnd yet, such models exist. CRIC\u2019s fourth founding fellow is John Alderdice, who was involved in the negotiations that led to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. That agreement came about, Alderdice says, because of a paradigm shift \u2013 a realisation that it was not enough to engage only the rational actors on each side; the devoted actors, or \u201cextremists\u201d as they were often referred to, had to be brought to the table too. \u201cThat involved listening to them, even if you disagreed profoundly with them, and asking what it was they were right about,\u201d he says.\nOne thing devoted actors are often right about \u2013 or at least more so than foreign powers \u2013 is how the local communities they are embedded in think and feel. The Taliban\u2019s success in Afghanistan owed a lot to tribal links that cut across their own and government forces, for example, and that they were able to leverage once the US had announced its impending withdrawal.\nThe Taliban may control Afghanistan, but the US and its allies still need to engage with them going forward, and soon, if the west wants to avert a humanitarian crisis and perhaps further conflict there, as well as exacerbating the risk of international terrorism. President Trump may have unwittingly shown how. The deal he initiated with the Taliban in 2020 has been criticised (his administration also tried and failed to cut Minerva\u2019s funding), but at least he forced the two sides to the table. \u201cIt was precisely because he didn\u2019t care that he was immune to the narratives that held us all hostage, and that fuelled a war that kept killing Afghans,\u201d says Ashley Jackson.\nPresident Biden\u2019s declaration on 31 August that the US had had enough of nation-building abroad could open the way to a more lasting paradigm shift, if western governments are prepared to be guided by the evidence. Whitehouse, for one, says it\u2019s long past time the problem was posed differently: \u201cRather than trying to foist alien value systems and group alignments on to populations that are already committed to different values and group alignments, how can we build on what\u2019s there in a more consensual way to create enduringly peaceful and prosperous futures?\u201d\nThe rewards of such a shift could extend to healing some of the fractures that have opened up in western societies too \u2013 partly due to the polarising effects of social media. The Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol, and those people who refuse Covid-19 vaccines on grounds of personal freedom, both fit the profile of devoted actors. Rational argument has not changed their minds, and governments have turned to force \u2013 in the form of vaccine mandates, for example. What these researchers are saying is that there may be a third way, and that science also holds the key to understanding those who reject it. \u201cIn the end,\u201d says Whitehouse, \u201cscience-driven approaches are likely to do far more \u2026 to stem the tide of radicalisation, and to defuse those already committed to extreme pro-group action.\u201d",

        "content": "From turning CO2 into rock to capturing the breath of office workers, a growing number of companies think the answer is yes\nDoes the world need millions of machines sucking carbon dioxide directly out of the air to beat the climate crisis? There is a fast-growing number of companies that believe the answer is yes and that are deploying their first devices into the real world.\nFrom turning CO2 into rock in Iceland, to capturing the breath of office workers, to \u201cputting oil back underground\u201d, their aim is to scale up rapidly and some have already sold their CO2 removal services to buyers including Bill Gates, Swiss Re, Shopify and Audi. Prices, however, are sky high \u2013 $600 (\u00a3440) per tonne and more. Given that humans emit about 36bn tonnes a year, that is problematic. .\nDirect air capture (Dac), as the technology is known, is challenging in more ways than just financially. Despite its potent climate heating properties, CO2 makes up just 0.04% of air and so trapping a tonne of the gas means processing a volume of air equivalent to 800 Olympic swimming pools.\n\u201cIt is not super intuitive,\u201d says Jan Wurzbacher at Climeworks, which just opened the world\u2019s biggest Dac plant in Iceland and recently hosted a conference for the Dac industry. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it is hard. There is no physical reason it can\u2019t be done for $100/tonne in the next 10-20 years.\u201d\nThe Dac industry is still young and there is a proliferation of technologies and business models, though most use modular machines that should be easier to manufacture and stack.\nClimeworks\u2019 units use fans to pass air over a solid material that absorbs CO2. When the material is saturated, it is heated to 100C (212F) and releases a stream of pure CO2. Its Orca plant in Iceland uses renewable geothermal energy.\nThe CO2 is then taken by a partner company, Carbfix, and put underground with water, where it solidifies into rock in two years. About 4,000 tonnes a year will be captured and the company is also working on projects in Oman and Norway.\nCanadian firm Carbon Engineering takes a similar approach to CO2 capture but is looking to bury the CO2 in depleted oil and gas reservoirs in the US and the North Sea off Scotland, effectively reversing the flow in existing pipes. \u201cRather than the transportation of gas in, it\u2019s the transportation of CO2 out,\u201d says Amy Ruddock, the company\u2019s European head.\n\u201cImportantly, there is a huge overlap between the skill sets required to do Dac and traditional oil and gas, so it really supports the green transition,\u201d she says. The company aims to bury 1m tonnes a year in the US in 2025, at about $300/tonne. The company also wants to use its technology to provide CO2 as a feedstock for producing low-CO2 jet fuel. \u201cThat\u2019s the largest market we\u2019re seeing at the moment,\u201d Ruddock says.\nPeter Reinhardt, CEO of Charm Industrial, has an even more striking pitch: \u201cWe put oil back underground.\u201d The company takes agricultural and forestry waste that would otherwise rot \u2013 emitting CO2 \u2013 and heats it to create \u201cbio-oil\u201d that is then pumped back into empty oil reservoirs.\nThe first injection took place in Oklahoma in January and the equivalent of 1,400 tonnes of CO2 has been buried this year, at a cost of $600/tonne. \u201cObviously there is a long way to go \u2013 it\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of the problem,\u201d Reinhardt says. But if 500,000 machines are deployed, he says, a billion tonnes could be buried at $50/tonne.\nCarbonCapture Inc, a US firm, is using \u201cmolecular sieves\u201d called zeolites to capture the CO2. Handily, zeolites are already produced in huge volumes for use in laundry detergents, oil refineries and sewage plants. In the Netherlands, Carbyon hopes using thin-film technology will make its machines faster at separating the CO2 from the air.\nEnergy use is a big concern if Dac is to be deployed at massive scale and Mission Zero Technologies uses electrochemical processes to release the captured CO2, which it says means 3-5 times less power is needed than for heat-based processes.\nAnother firm, Heirloom, does away with fans and allows heat-treated rocks to passively absorb CO2 over a couple of weeks, before more heating liberates the gas. \u201cWe are trying to turn this Dac problem from a chemical engineering problem into an industrial automation problem,\u201d says Shashank Samala. \u201cImagine white powder on cookie trays in cafeteria tray racks \u2013 it\u2019s pretty simple.\u201d\nThere are also other business models. Soletair Power\u2019s approach is to turn buildings into CO2-capturing machines. The CO2 in exhaled breath makes offices stuffy and can reduce worker productivity, says CEO Petri Laakso. \u201cBasically people are more stupid indoors and that means thousands of dollars of loss for companies in offices,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a different business logic: we sell fresh indoor air as a service.\u201d The company\u2019s current office unit can capture a kilogram of CO2 every 8 hours.\nA lack of commercial CO2 supply recently hit the UK, and AirCapture, based in California, is developing onsite machines that suck CO2 from the air to produce streams for businesses such as drinks companies. Most CO2 today is produced from fossil fuels and has to be trucked to sites.\nBut can these systems really play a significant part in beating the climate crisis?\nThe biggest and most urgent task in beating the climate emergency is to slash the burning of fossil fuels to as close to zero as possible. The problem is that some sectors are very hard to decarbonise, such as farming, aviation and certain industrial processes, and these emissions have to be mopped up to stop global heating.\nIt is also likely, given that CO2 emissions are actually still rising, that the world will overshoot the carbon budget for the internationally agreed 1.5C target. This also means CO2 is going to have to be pulled from the air. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2018 that billions of tonnes of CO2 a year may need to be captured and buried after 2050.\n\u201cUnless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CO2 removal becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, 1.5C-consistent pathways will be difficult to realise, especially in overshoot scenarios,\u201d the IPCC said. \u201cRoughly, we need to take care of 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year in mid-century,\u201d says Wurzbacher.\nDac, however, is not the only option. Growing crops, burning them to produce power, and burying the emissions also removes CO2, but scientists worry about the huge land and water requirements. Growing trees \u2013 the original CO2 removal machines \u2013 is also an option, but also requires a lot of land, takes time and the forests then have to be protected for decades or the CO2 goes up in smoke.\nProf Thomas Crowther, an ecologist at ETH Zurich and prominent backer of reforestation, says: \u201cWe cannot simply plant a blanket of trees across the planet and hope to save the world \u2013 nature isn\u2019t going to do this alone. We are undoubtedly going to need thousands of solutions.\u201d He says technology for drawing down CO2 has immense potential.\nChristoph Gebald at Climeworks is bullish about his company\u2019s technology: \u201cWe are very confident we can achieve million-tonne [per year] capacity in the second half of this decade, and billion-tonne capacity by 2050.\u201d\nBusinesses are increasingly buying offsets to claim carbon neutrality, often via schemes that claim to protect forests, plant trees or install renewable energy. But many offset schemes are criticised as smoke and mirrors. Gebald argues that, by contrast, Dac with underground burial offers immediate, permanent and easily measurable CO2 disposal.\nWill the financials add up? For all these companies, scaling up to crush the cost of their technologies is critical. Hans De Neve, founder of Carbyon, says solar panels were originally extremely expensive but have plummeted in price, falling by 80% in the last decade alone: \u201cI see no fundamental reason why this can\u2019t happen for the Dac industry.\u201d\nGebald says Dac will need a subsidy phase. \u201cSolar PV in the 2000s was receiving subsidies well north of $500 per tonne of CO2, and with the support of billions of dollars annually over 10 years, this really helped the industry to scale and drive down costs.\u201d Ruddock highlights the cost of unchecked global heating: \u201cThe benchmark I would throw out there is what is the cost of going above 1.5C or 2C?\u201d\nThe other critical factor for large-scale Dac is the creation of a market for CO2 disposal. Jet fuel and clean office air might raise some funds in the near term, but not enough to get to removing billions of tonnes of CO2 a year.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no price on CO2, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to establish these technologies,\u201d says Prof Reto Knutti, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich. \u201cSo I think that governments have to say, yes, there is a price for CO2, and then the private sector can come up with fancy innovative solutions.\u201d Negotiations over rules for an international CO2 market will be one of the main issues at the Cop26 summit in November, and the backers of Dac will be hoping for success.\nEarly adopters of Dac, like Microsoft, are already pushing funding into the sector, and both Elon Musk and the UK government have launched technology competitions worth $100m and \u00a3100m respectively. There are also some early offset customers, such as insurance giant Swiss Re, which has signed a 10-year deal with Climeworks, and Shopify, both attracted by the certainty of removal.\nJens Burchardt of Boston Consulting Group, another customer, says: \u201cWe think it\u2019s something that the world undoubtedly needs to get to net zero and we are one of not-so-many companies in the world who can afford to give this a push at a time when its economics are not yet where they need to be.\u201d\nClimate campaigners, such as Greenpeace, have argued that Dac could be a dangerous distraction. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t wait until tech like Dac is finally affordable or widely available if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change,\u201d says Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace UK. \u201cIf overhyping Dac encourages delay and dithering on the necessary action to cut emissions then it will make the situation worse, not better.\u201d\nProf Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University and author of The New Climate War, says: \u201cOf all of the geoengineering schemes, Dac seems the safest and most efficacious. It could, along with natural reforestation, be an important component of broader efforts to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, a strategy that arguably belongs in any comprehensive climate abatement program. But since we\u2019re only talking about capturing 10%, at most, of current carbon emissions, this obviously cannot be a primary strategy for cutting emissions.\u201d\n\u201cDac would be an amazing weapon in the fight against climate change,\u201d says Robert Rohde, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. \u201cHowever, it remains very small-scale and high cost. Current global capacity for Dac is about 12,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. Each year, human activities release 40bn tonnes. So, right now, Dac is like trying to bail out the Titanic using an eyedropper.\u201d\n\u201cThe industry needs to find a way to rapidly grow many thousands of times larger, and cut costs by about 80%, if they are going to have a real hope of making a tangible impact in the fight against global warming,\u201d says Rohde. \u201cIt will be great if they can make it work, but I am not optimistic, and most of the world\u2019s attention should be focused on reducing emissions because we don\u2019t have time to wait.\u201d\nScaling up rapidly will require huge investment, but Adrian Corless, CEO at CarbonCapture, points out that many trillions of dollars have been invested in oil and gas infrastructure, which is the source of much of the climate crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should scare or surprise anyone that to solve the climate problem it will need an industry on the scale of the oil and gas industry,\u201d he says.",

Now petrol stations have started rationing as the impact of the chronic lorry driver shortage widens. What is causing the crisis in petrol supplies and what are the solutions \u2013 and is there any reason to panic?\nIt is not lack of petrol but a lack of HGV drivers that is hitting supply chains across the country. The shortage is compounded by the need for a separate qualification needed to deliver hazardous substances.\nThe government is urging people not to panic-buy. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said people should \u201ccarry on as normal\u201d.\nBut with echoes of last March\u2019s lockdown stockpiling, people are ignoring the government. Long queues started building in some forecourt stations on Friday.\nThree of the UK\u2019s biggest operators of petrol states have warned of fuel shortages with BP, saying up to 100 of its stations were short of at least one grade of fuel and several forced to close entirely. However, this is a fraction of its 1,200 strong forecourt network. Esso owner Exxon Mobile said a \u201csmall number\u201d of its Tesco forecourts had been affected.\nGordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), said some sites were experiencing delays, particularly those in London and the south-east of England.\nBP said it was cutting deliveries to about 90% of its stations in an attempt to distribute supplies evenly. The PRA is urging people not to panic-buy, but advising drivers to keep their tanks at least a quarter full in case they have to drive to another station to fill up.\nThe industry estimates there is a gap of 100,000 lorry drivers partly due to Covid and partly Brexit. About 25,000 HGV drivers from the EU left during 2020 and did not return, and there is a backlog of 40,000 waiting to take their HGV tests. The Road Haulage Association says the government is not taking the problem seriously enough. \u201cThe average age of a truck driver in the UK is 57, every day this problem is just getting worse as more and more retire,\u201d said Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the RHA.\nThe freight and logistics sector have been pleading with the government for months to introduce a temporary immigration waiver for drivers not just in Europe but across the world to help alleviate the shortage.\nLogistics UK, which represents freight owners, points out that there are eight different short term work visa schemes for various sectors ranging from farming to sports and religious employees.\nBut the government has rejected their calls arguing thatpaying and training British truck drivers is the solution. Industry statistics show that there has been a shortage in the sector for a decade as drivers move to more attractive careers. Driving in the UK is seen as even less attractive than it is on the continent because of the lack of specialised facilities including toilets, showers and canteens.\nLast October, the Conservative MP Karl McCartney told the transport select committee of a \u201cproliferation of bottles that look like they\u2019re filled with Irn-Bru but they\u2019re not\u201d discarded by truckers on laybys where they were forced to take their mandatory breaks because of the paucity of lorry stops.\nLogistics UK has said even with efforts to intensify HGV testing with test sites open at weekends, the shortfall could not be cleared until spring next year, leading to fears over Christmas food, trees and turkey shortages.",

        "content": "Great expectations and doubts await leader at Labour conference as he tries to show party is turning a corner\nIt was at the Devon seaside that Keir Starmer finished his first draft of the speech that is set to be the most important moment of his political career to date. The Labour leader was ostensibly on holiday when he first rang aides to talk through his big pitch, his family yelling at him in the background, telling him to hurry up for their day out.\nIt is unsurprising that the Labour leader feels so much is at stake as he returns to the coast, this time in Brighton, for his first in-person Labour conference as leader.\nIn the Guardian\u2019s conversations with five shadow cabinet ministers, plus senior aides, party staff, MPs and trade unionists, they reveal how much they feel is riding on this moment \u2013 and the battle in shadow cabinet over whether to go \u201cBiden big\u201d (the US president unveiled a multitrillion-dollar recovery plan this year) or preach fiscal responsibility at a moment of economic turmoil.\nNext week is a moment that many of his allies believe he can seize, but there are also some who say his leadership will be in grave peril if he does not \u2013 and that Starmer is rapidly losing faith and goodwill.\nStarmer began the week with a 35-page opus on his political philosophy, published by the Fabian Society and designed to answer to those critics who say they do not know what he stands for.\nThat will be the launchpad for his speech on Wednesday, one that will emphasise core commitments on secure work, community and responsibility. Aides say he will make a definitive break with the theme of his last conference speech, where he said Labour \u201cdeserved to lose\u201d. Senior figures believe \u201cthe time for self-flagellation is now over\u201d.\nThe writing team, which has been kept tight, includes Tony Blair\u2019s speechwriter, Phil Collins, and Starmer\u2019s close aides Claire Ainsley, Deborah Mattinson and Paul Ovenden. \u201cBut it is very much Keir,\u201d one said.\nStarmer has been rehearsing his speech on stage at London\u2019s Trafalgar Studios, joking with staff there that if he hung around long enough he could take part in the Jersey Boys matinee.\nParty figures have been brainstorming to find ways to make the conference a big moment that will translate to the wider public. One official claimed there had been early inquiries about whether footballers like Marcus Rashford and other celebrities could be invited to watch the speech, though others denied this, saying \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel very Keir\u201d.\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: \u201cI think most people across the country are now in a place where they want to see real, transformative change. They want Britain to play a part in the world, stand up for their values, a prime minister they trust to make decisions in the national interest. I think most people in the party are there. We now have a week where we can show the country that is the case.\u201d\nWhile Starmer\u2019s advisers want to show the party is turning a corner, however, the conference looks set to be dominated by factional rows over internal rule changes. Starmer will attempt to bring a return of the electoral college, which gives MPs more power to choose party leaders and has enraged the party\u2019s left.\n\u201cThe focus is on all the wrong things,\u201d said the former shadow cabinet minister Richard Burgon. \u201cPeople across the country in this moment of crisis are looking to the Labour party, but this conference is already looking like a missed opportunity.\u201d\nStarmer\u2019s allies have concerns, too. \u201cIf I were Keir, I would be very seriously questioning the motivations of the people who are pushing this,\u201d a senior MP said. \u201cThe right of the party have their doubts about him too. This makes it safer to replace him without risking a left-wing winner again. Why is he raising the spectre of his own departure?\u201d\nShadow cabinet ministers are feeling the pressure \u2013 even without what many view as an unnecessary, internecine war. \u201cFrankly the thing that matters most is the speech, it\u2019s the moment where we work out if he can relate to the country or if he can\u2019t,\u201d one said. Another was even blunter about what is at stake: \u201cIf Keir fails to seize the moment then there will be alarm.\u201d\nOne colleague raised the possibility of a leadership challenge, saying that an unlucky combination of a disastrous conference and one or two shock byelection losses could see \u201cthings \u2026 start to snowball out of control very quickly\u201d.\n\u201cWhether anyone is actually properly organising against him is another question. But the problem is that the majority view among the [parliamentary Labour party] is concern,\u201d they said. \u201cIn truth, I am also starting to panic a bit.\u201d\nStarmer\u2019s relatively recent entry into politics makes him more vulnerable. \u201cKeir does not have a pretorian guard,\u201d one shadow cabinet minister said. \u201cAnd I think MPs feel unable to defend him on the airwaves sometimes because they are unsure of the party\u2019s position on key issues.\u201d\nAnother senior Labour staffer complained: \u201cThere have been constant relaunches and visions \u2013 how many times? \u2013 briefed since last year. The speech in February was billed as the big moment and then the big idea was Covid bonds. That\u2019s when people felt their doubts were being realised.\u201d\nMPs on all wings of the party expressed a desire for Starmer to set out the party\u2019s specific position on key issues \u2013 and frustration at perceived paralysis in the last six months.\n\u201cThe moment has arrived to stop kicking the can down the road \u2013 not just on big issues like social care and tax and the Green New Deal and the energy crisis \u2013 but also on other things that matter where it looks like Labour doesn\u2019t even have a clue, such as trans rights and even Jeremy [Corbyn\u2019s] suspension\u201d one said.\nIf everything goes wrong in Brighton, there is talk of two specific threats to Starmer, though neither has any real path to an imminent challenge. The first is Andy Burnham, the popular mayor of Greater Manchester who has made it clear he wants the job. \u201cHe is a huge electoral asset in the north-west with his own power base and loyal MPs,\u201d one shadow minister said. But Burnham cannot launch a challenge because he is not an MP.\nThe other is Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, a plain-speaking former care worker who also has a loyal coterie of friendly MPs. But relations have improved between the leader and his deputy since a bitter split after an attempted demotion in the wake of the disastrous Hartlepool byelection.\nTheir advisers still often do not see eye-to-eye on strategy, but the pair frequently have lunch and their teams coalesced at Rayner\u2019s flat to prepare her for prime minister\u2019s questions against Dominic Raab on Wednesday.\nDespite the gripes, most shadow cabinet ministers and MPs are insistent they retain their faith in Starmer even if they want to see him move up a gear. \u201cKeir has a huge asset in that he looks like a prime minister in a way that Ed [Miliband] and Jeremy [Corbyn] never did,\u201d a shadow cabinet minister said.\nThough Starmer\u2019s Fabian essay started life in his notebook, scribbled in pen and paper on trains as he toured constituencies this summer, Ovenden and Ainsley helped bring it to fruition. Yet even over 35 pages and 12,500 words, there is a battle at the heart of the party that the article does not quite answer \u2013 how big should Labour go?\nAmong some senior shadow cabinet ministers, like Rayner and Miliband, there is a desire for Labour to go \u201cBiden bold\u201d and embrace significant change. \u201cCorbyn without the madness\u201d as one shadow cabinet minister put it.\n\u201cKeir has no choice but to go bold \u2013 the US is going bold and their economy is growing,\u201d a shadow cabinet minister said. \u201cThe UK will not be an international economic outlier if it decides to spend big.\u201d\nMany in the party want to see Starmer respond with a vision of how to tackle the impending winter crisis \u2013 empty supermarket shelves, soaring energy bills, an embattled NHS and cuts to universal credit. \u201cKeir must be the voice of the British people on this,\u201d the shadow minister said.\nRayner\u2019s own speech will draw a link between Labour\u2019s 1945 manifesto, Let Us Face the Future, and post-Covid Britain, and set out an ambition to fundamentally change the world of work.\nBut there are also influential voices in the shadow cabinet, like Rachel Reeves and the party chair, Anneliese Dodds, who believe the party must pay attention to grave public concerns about the state of the British economy.\nThough Starmer\u2019s advisers say his political instinct is for a big economic offer by the time of the next election, his Fabian essay repeatedly emphasises responsibility and restraint.\nMembers of the backbench Socialist Campaign Group of MPs were sharing a screen grab of the essay on WhatsApp on Wednesday night, underlining where Starmer said he wanted \u201can effective partnership between state and private sectors\u201d and listed \u201chealth\u201d as one of its areas.\n\u201cI think if Keir carries on down this course, he runs the risk of being recorded in history as a pound-shop Neil Kinnock,\u201d Burgon said. \u201cThis talk of a \u2018contribution country\u2019 is deeply uninspiring.\u201d\nEven if Starmer exceeds the expectations of MPs, the Labour conference could still be dominated by internal rows of his own making.\nSenior figures in Unite feel particularly betrayed by the return to previous leadership election rules. On Monday, Starmer met the union\u2019s new general secretary, Sharon Graham, who told him cordially she could not attend conference because of demanding industrial disputes. Starmer was understanding, but it is understood the topic of Labour rule changes was never raised. That night, the news started to leak.\nStarmer\u2019s allies insist the idea to change internal party rules is all his own \u2013 but he has come under pressure from members of Labour\u2019s centrist wing who believe there has been mass change at constituency-party level which has allowed the election of pro-Starmer delegates to the Labour conference. Momentum say pro-Starmer organisers have done their sums wrong and there will be a left majority.\nGaya Sriskanthan, Momentum\u2019s co-chair, said many activists, whatever their bent, felt betrayed by the leadership\u2019s pursuit of rule change and urged Starmer to refocus on issues that would inspire younger members.\n\u201cHe keeps talking about listening to the country but then he never says anything of substance, and then he refuses to listen to the membership as well \u2013 so who is he listening to?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have serious, transformative policies like the Green New Deal being brought to conference. Motions on housing, the NHS, which are issues people care about. He should be spending more time and energy demonstrating that he cares about them.\u201d\nSources close to Starmer fiercely reject claims of political naivety. \u201cI hate it when people say he\u2019s this political noob; he became leader less than five years after being elected to parliament,\u201d one aide said. \u201cWhat he believes is Labour must turn outwards. Changing these rules \u2013 particularly making it harder to deselect MPs \u2013 means we can focus properly on the voters.\u201d\nThere are other major areas of dispute: a wing of the membership still angry at Corbyn\u2019s suspension and a chance for that to bubble over when the former leader speaks at Momentum\u2019s fringe conference.\nThere is also considerable disquiet in the party over a perceived lack of vocal support for trans rights and the conduct of the MP Rosie Duffield, whom some have accused of transphobia. Duffield has said she feels unable to attend her own party\u2019s conference because of threats.\nFor many MPs, aides and even members, stepping into the conference this weekend after almost two years will feel like stepping into a great unknown. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what the mood of the party is going to be like,\u201d one shadow cabinet minister said. \u201cMy sense is members are anxious, but fundamentally very loyal to the leader, even when they haven\u2019t voted for him.\u201d\nNandy said she was optimistic that a coming together of Labour activists, MPs and campaigners at the Brighton seaside would be a turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that people get excited about Labour again. Keir wants to enthuse people,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people join the party because they want to change the world. We have to harness that and I think it can be done.\u201d\nAnother said the prize of a successful conference would be an enormous boost to party morale \u2013 to members and to MPs, that could translate into momentum for the autumn. \u201cWe could potentially be a much better place at the end of conference than people think,\u201d they said.",

        "content": "Very much in the mould of such earlier generation British film directors as Stephen Frears and Mike Newell, Roger Michell, who has died unexpectedly aged 65, gravitated smoothly from Cambridge University to the Royal Court theatre, where he was an assistant director to both John Osborne and Samuel Beckett. After a five-year stint at the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1980s, Michell plunged into television and film with the splendid BBC series of Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia (1993). This was followed by Persuasion (1995) \u2013 one of the best ever screen adaptations (by Nick Dear) of Jane Austen, also for the BBC.\nHis defining moment in romcom and his passport to Hollywood was Notting Hill (1999), which trumped even Newell\u2019s great Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). Both were written by Richard Curtis, and both starred a brilliantly offhand and charmingly slapdash Hugh Grant, with the clinching bonus in the second of a delightful performance by Julia Roberts in classic tandem with Grant.\nMichell, like Frears and Newell, was a big, bear-like man, with a modest and affable manner and an acute sense of his own responsibility towards the writers whose work he translated into flesh and blood, and the actors he cast so cannily. There was never any fanfare or fuss. He just got on with the job. He didn\u2019t exactly avoid the razzmatazz and red carpets, but he certainly kept a low profile.\nThe son of Jillian (nee Green) and HD Michell, Roger was born in Pretoria, South Africa, where his father, a British diplomat, was on a posting. As a child, he lived abroad with his parents in Lebanon, Syria and Czechoslovakia, before boarding at Clifton college in Bristol. From there he took a degree at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, and immersed himself in university drama.\nWith his college friend and contemporary Richard Maher, he wrote and directed a clever Raymond Chandler spoof, Private Dick, for the Edinburgh fringe in 1980 (\u201cShe gave me the kind of smile that would have made the pope loosen his necktie\u201d), which came to the Whitehall theatre in London, starring Robert Powell. The duo followed with a less successful spoof, The White Glove (1983), with Adrian Edmondson, in which Holmes and Watson blundered into the last scene of The Cherry Orchard. This surfaced at the Lyric, Hammersmith.\nIn between, he directed a fine Nick Darke play, The Catch, about Cornish fishers, in the Royal Court\u2019s upstairs studio, before launching his RSC career with a disarmingly wacky Darke effort, The Dead Monkey, in which Frances Barber and Bruce Alexander, as a dysfunctional California couple, consumed their deceased pet simian at the dinner table.\nAs well as directing a no-nonsense 1987 Hamlet with Philip Franks, and a mischievously intelligent revival of George Farquhar\u2019s The Constant Couple (with Simon Russell Beale resembling Mollie Sugden as a prancing fop in red tights and Rasta curls) in 1988, he forged a productive RSC relationship with the American playwright Richard Nelson.\nIn Some Americans Abroad (1989), Nelson had fun with a collegiate theatre party coming to worship at the shrine of Shakespeare, while Two Shakespearean Actors (1990), set in 1849 during the New York riots that accompanied William Macready\u2019s Macbeth, taken as an act of gross cultural encroachment, was a finely tuned meditation on transatlantic rivalry and the art of acting. John Carlisle was Macready, Anton Lesser his American opposite number, Edwin Forrest, with Ciar\u00e1n Hinds chipping in as the playwright-director Dion Boucicault.\nFinding himself left out in the cold at the RSC when Adrian Noble succeeded Terry Hands as artistic director in 1990, Michell enrolled on a three-month BBC television director\u2019s course, which changed his life. Apart from anything else, this enabled him to make a fine television play of one of his biggest theatre hits, Kevin Elyot\u2019s My Night With Reg (1994), a beautiful, hilarious, heartbreaking comedy among a group of gay friends, each of whom had a connection with the deceased (from Aids), Reg, which opened in the Royal Court\u2019s studio and moved triumphantly into the West End and beyond.\nEven as his Hollywood career prospered, Michell kept his theatrical hand in at the National Theatre with a string of superb new productions: Mustapha Matura\u2019s The Coup (1991) dissected the comic muddle of power-seeking after the Trinidad coup of 1970 (Norman Beaton was the jailed president); Joe Penhall\u2019s Blue/Orange (2000) was a brilliantly staged game of prophetic intellectual ping pong between Bill Nighy and Andrew Lincoln as doctors, with Chiwetel Ejiofor as their guinea pig-style mental health patient; Joanna Murray-Smith\u2019s Honour (2003), on which he worked for the first time with Anna Maxwell Martin (who became his second wife), alongside Eileen Atkins and Corin Redgrave; and Nina Raine\u2019s Consent (2017), which was a fierce domestic comedy anatomising a distinction between law and justice on a controversial rape case.\nAn earlier collaboration with Raine, Tribes (2010) at the Royal Court, centred on a deaf boy\u2019s relationship with his family and drew brilliant performances from Michelle Terry and Phoebe Waller-Bridge; the latter had also been a daffy delight as a \u201cbright young thing\u201d in Michell\u2019s Almeida theatre staging of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s gruesome thriller Rope at the Almeida in 2009. In this decade there were also fine revivals of Pinter\u2019s Old Times (Helen McCrory, Gina McKee and Jeremy Northam) and Betrayal (Toby Stephens, Dervla Kirwan and Samuel West), both at the Donmar Warehouse, both triangular dream-like recollections of friendship, time slippage and sexual ownership.\nTwo of his most remarkable films, both written by Kureishi, celebrated the enduring sexual potency of senior citizens. In The Mother (2003), Anne Reid as a widowed grandmother falls in explicit lust with Daniel Craig as a handsome handyman who is renovating her son\u2019s house while having an affair with her daughter; and in Venus (2007), Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s elderly actor is charmingly attracted to his friend\u2019s grand-niece (Jodie Whittaker); O\u2019Toole\u2019s performance in this touching and unusual film won him his eighth and last Oscar nomination.\nThe rich, almost kaleidoscopic pattern of Michell\u2019s career embraced a lovely adaptation (by Penhall) of Ian McEwan\u2019s Enduring Love (2004, with Craig and Maxwell Martin); Bill Murray as FDR and Olivia Colman as the consort Queen Elizabeth in Hyde Park on Hudson (2013); a wonderful comic duel between Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a middle-aged couple re-examining their marriage on an anniversary trip to Paris in Kureishi\u2019s Le Week-End (2013); and a stylishly done remake of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s My Cousin Rachel (2017), with smouldering performances from Sam Claflin and Rachel Weisz.\nA heart attack in 1999 meant Michell had to pull out of Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin, a project that fell successfully to the director John Madden. And he withdrew from directing Craig\u2019s second Bond movie, Quantum of Solace, becoming anxious about the schedule and the lack of a script to allow for the assiduous preparation he favoured before shooting.\nOn television, two documentaries about actors \u2013 Michael Redgrave, My Father (1997) and Nothing Like a Dame (2018) with Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Atkins comparing notes, somewhat tartly, amid smirks and giggles in Joan Plowright\u2019s garden \u2013 were punctuated by two impressive dramas. In The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies (2014), Jason Watkins played Michell\u2019s Clifton college teacher falsely and disgracefully vilified after being discharged as a murder suspect; and in the 2015 film of Penhall\u2019s surreal but serious Birthday (Royal Court, 2012), Stephen Mangan took on a reproductive and maternal role in lieu of his high-flying executive wife (Lisa Dillon), who had not enjoyed having their first child.\nThe range and variety of this work amounted to a confirmation of human dignity and humane values, all expressed with nuance, subtlety and good humour. There was never anything mucky or murky in Michell\u2019s work, as he became an outstanding technician in cinema as well as a leading practitioner in theatre. With so much more to look forward to, his death must be counted a tragic loss.\nMichell won two Bafta awards, for Persuasion and The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies, and was the Judith E Wilson senior fellow at Cambridge in 1990.\nHe was married to the actor Kate Buffery from 1992 to 2002, when they divorced. In 2010 he married Anna Maxwell Martin; they announced their separation in 2020. He is survived by two children, Rosanna and Harry, from his first marriage, and two, Maggie and Nancy, from his second.\n Roger Harry Michell, theatre and film director, born 5 June 1956; died 22 September 2021",

        "content": "Meeting on Friday expected to seek compromise over whether to recruit drivers from abroad\nA cabinet split is hampering the government\u2019s efforts to deal with the nationwide shortage of lorry drivers that threatens fuel supplies at some petrol stations and caused some panic-buying of fuel on Friday, the Guardian has learned.\nMinisters are divided about the best way to solve the shortage of lorry drivers, with a meeting on Friday afternoon expected to seek a compromise over whether to recruit more drivers from abroad.\nOn Friday, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said he would move \u201cheaven and earth\u201d to solve the problem, and kept on the table the idea of adding truck drivers to the \u201cshortage occupation list\u201d, which would let foreign drivers enter the country more easily.\nBut multiple sources said Shapps and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, were sceptical about the idea and another source said the Home Office, led by Priti Patel, was also unconvinced.\nThe idea is being pushed by the environment secretary, George Eustice, and by the Cabinet Office, led by Steve Barclay, as a way to boost the availability of drivers to deliver petrol to forecourts.\nOne potential compromise due to be discussed on Friday is a special short-term visa scheme for lorry drivers that could tackle the immediate crisis.\nThe Home Office will ultimately make the decision over whether to relax restrictions for drivers, with the government recognising that something has to be done about the shortage to avoid scenes of chaos at petrol stations.\nKwarteng is understood to believe that oil companies should be paying their drivers more and offering better working conditions, rather than the UK seeking to recruit from abroad.\nOne Whitehall source said those cabinet ministers opposed to the shortage-occupation-list solution would prefer a plan to tempt back to the sector some of the 600,000 people with heavy goods licences not currently employed as drivers.\nAnother senior government source said some ministers appeared to be keen to avoid at all costs the perception that Brexit was to blame for the shortage, accounting for its reluctance to relax immigration rules.\nEarlier on Friday, Shapps said he would consider all options, including the possibility of issuing short-term skilled worker visas to tap mainland Europe\u2019s pool of potential HGV drivers. He said motorists should not panic as the problem would be \u201csmoothed out relatively quickly\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019ll look at everything,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule anything out. We will move heaven and earth to do whatever it takes to make sure shortages are alleviated with HGV drivers.\u201d\nAsked about the Petrol Retailers Association warning that drivers should keep a quarter of a tank of fuel in their car in case forecourts ran out, Shapps downplayed the issue and said motorists should \u201ccarry on as normal\u201d and not panic-buy.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying there is no issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an issue. Although there are stresses and strains in the system, by and large it has not impacted on people\u2019s everyday life when it comes to filling up with petrol. There is not a shortage of fuel at the refineries.\u201d\nShapps blamed Covid, which he said delayed 40,000 drivers taking their HGV driving tests, but added that the government had changed the law to ease the \u201cbottleneck\u201d. More than twice as many driver tests were now available compared with pre-pandemic, he said.\nShapps said the driver shortage was not a new problem and that the UK had relied over a long period of time on \u201cimporting cheap European, often eastern European, labour undercutting the domestic market\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to make this a more attractive industry\u201d, welcoming salary and wage increases for HGV drivers.\nAsked about the role of Brexit in the driver crisis, he said EU countries such as Poland and Germany had \u201cvery large and even larger\u201d shortages. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people point to Brexit as the culprit here; in fact, they are wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of Brexit, I\u2019ve been able to change the law and alter the way our driving tests are taken in a way I could not have done if we were still part of the EU. Brexit has actually provided part of the solution.\u201d",

        "content": "At its height, the Del Rio encampment harbored about 14,000 migrants \u2013 but even as traffic is dwindling, the situation has deteriorated\n\u201cWelcome to Texas,\u201d says a big, green sign near the Del Rio International Bridge.\nBut no one is welcome here, not since the west Texas border city has transformed into what could be mistaken for a war zone. A helicopter \u2013 barely discernible in the afternoon sky \u2013 looms nearby. The earth, beige and dusty, is crawling with security personnel carrying assault weapons.\nThe small border city of Del Rio, population about 35,000, this week became a symbolic ground zero for Haitians escaping to the United States, as political and environmental strife force a mass exodus from the Caribbean nation. Thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have set up camp under Del Rio\u2019s International Bridge, waiting to be processed by immigration officials.\nShocking images from the jam-packed encampment have suggested chaos and terror in recent days: Black migrants wading through the Rio Grande River, confronted by aggressive border patrol agents on horseback. The Biden administration halted border patrol agents\u2019 use of horses in Del Rio on Thursday, amid public outcry over disturbing pictures showing them charging at migrants.\nYet anyone still under the squalid bridge has now been rendered invisible to the outside world, locked down behind gates, fences and armed guards.\nJust minutes away, though, vans pull up to a nondescript building, and people pour out. They\u2019ve arrived at yet another way station on their transnational journey, this time greeted by volunteers who give them pizza slices and water bottles before the next leg.\nOn Thursday afternoon, vans came one after the other in a near-constant succession. An aid worker, Santiago Pardo, says mornings are even busier. The migrants and asylum seekers show up whenever border patrol decides it\u2019s time.\n\u201cThere\u2019s literally no schedule,\u201d Pardo says. \u201cThey just inform us, you know, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re on our way.\u2019\u201d\nThe outdoor space is teeming with babies and young children, many of them too tiny to walk. One infant holds tight to a stuffed lion toy. Another little boy is wearing too-long shorts, patterned with the American flag.\nMost are coming from Haiti, Cuba or Venezuela, Pardo says. Aid workers speaking earlier this week estimated that about 70-80% of people were originally from Haiti.\nAt its height, the Del Rio encampment at the US-Mexico border harbored about 14,000 migrants earlier this week. Now, fewer than 5,000 remain in the Del Rio sector as a whole, according to the White House. But even as traffic at the camp is dwindling, the situation has deteriorated, Pardo says \u2013 though he doesn\u2019t know enough to provide details.\nAs Pardo attends to new arrivals at the aid stop, Ignace Zidor checks every van that comes through for his 27-year-old sister. When he last heard from her on 17 September, she was under the bridge with her husband and two young children.\n\u201cThey said they were living in the dust. Sleeping in the dust. And it was terrible,\u201d he says.\nIgnace \u2013 who is originally from Haiti but moved to the US in 2006 \u2013 arrived in Del Rio around noon on Thursday, after he and his wife Vista drove 10 hours from Oklahoma. He\u2019s desperate to find his little sister, who doesn\u2019t know his home address and might have lost his phone number.\nShe could be in Houston, or Mexico, or still under the bridge. But he\u2019s hoping to catch her here.\n\u201cSo far, luck is not on our side,\u201d he admits.\nVista starts crying as she watches others in line for a bus. \u201cThese people came all the way through danger, turmoil, with a baby on their hip, and they\u2019ve made it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey made it here.\u201d\nBut not everyone\u2019s so lucky. Amid the humanitarian crisis in Del Rio, more than 1,400 Haitians have been repatriated since Sunday, without the due process afforded to other migrants. Haitians have long been put into the blanket category of \u201ceconomic refugees\u201d by the US, allowing authorities to ignore or quickly deny claims for asylum. Who gets released into the US from Del Rio and who is forcibly expelled largely remains a riddle.\nThe hardline policy is also a relic of the Trump era\u2019s pandemic response that effectively shuttered the border to most asylum seekers,denying them the chance to seek asylum. Joe Biden has continued to apply it, albeit through piecemeal and often unclear enforcement decisions.\nThis is not the first humanitarian migration crisis the Biden administration has encountered in almost eight months in office, and it will not be the last. The number of migrants arriving at the south-western border in June was the highest in years, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.\nHaving promised a more human system on the campaign trail, Biden is under increasing pressure from Democrats and Republicans to spell out what immigration reforms he intends to implement.\nMeanwhile, Daniel Foote, the new US envoy to Haiti, resigned in protest against the \u201cinhumane\u201d mass expulsions earlier this week. And Democratic firebrand representative Maxine Waters excoriated the Biden administration for continuing Trump\u2019s immigration legacy.\n\u201cWhat the hell are we doing here?\u201d Waters said, alluding to the now viral images of border patrol menacing Black migrants with horse reins. \u201cWhat we witnessed takes us back hundreds of years. What we witnessed was worse than what we witnessed in slavery.\u201d\nHaitians who are being forcibly repatriated will return to a nation in ruins, after President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated and a devastating earthquake hit earlier this year.\nVista pulls up a photo of her 65-year-old mother-in-law\u2019s home, reduced to remnants after the natural disaster. She\u2019s now surviving under a tarp with two of her sons, homeless.\nHaiti is no place to live right now, Ignace says, and everyone who makes it to the US should have the opportunity to apply for asylum.\n\u201cSending them back to Haiti is just killing them twice.\u201d",

        "content": "No 10 denies Brazilian president\u2019s claim but some speculate food item is turkeys for Christmas\nThe Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed Boris Johnson asked him for an \u201cemergency\u201d deal to ease shortages of an unspecified food product, amid concerns about further disruption to supermarket supplies.\nA lack of drivers and food pickers, as well as carbon dioxide used to stun animals for slaughter and create dry ice to keep food fresh, has led to fears that some goods will be missing from shelves in the run-up to Christmas.\nDowning Street has urged people not to panic-buy, after the announcement by BP that there may be a lack of fuel at some petrol stations and the managing director of Iceland supermarket warned food supplies could come under threat within days, not weeks.\nGovernment insiders worry about a return to the days leading up to the first coronavirus lockdown, where shelves were left bare as people stockpiled items such as toilet roll.\nBolsonaro made the claim about Johnson\u2019s request after a meeting between them in New York earlier this week at the UN general assembly. The prime minister had stressed the benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine to his Brazilian counterpart.\nDuring his weekly live broadcast on social media on Thursday night, Bolsonaro said: \u201c[One] thing I talked to Boris Johnson about was that he wants an emergency deal with us to import some kind of produce of ours, of which there are shortages in England.\n\u201cIt just goes to show that everyone\u2019s struggling with inflation after this \u2018stay at home, we\u2019ll deal with the economy later\u2019 business \u2013 and some countries are facing food shortages,\u201d he continued, using the supposed request from Johnson to justify rising inflation in Brazil, which experts say is the result of political and economic instability and a severe energy crisis that is affecting the South American country.\n\u201cI\u2019ve passed this potato on to Mrs Tereza Cristina,\u201d Bolsonaro added, in reference to Brazil\u2019s agriculture minister.\nHe also claimed Johnson had asked him to facilitate whisky imports into Brazil during their meeting in New York. \u201cI\u2019m going to get in trouble with the press here \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\u201cWhen I started chatting to Boris Johnson he talked about whisky \u2013 and asked me what I could do to make it easier to import whisky to Brazil. Look, it\u2019s not one of my priorities \u2013 making it easy to bring whisky into Brazil. This isn\u2019t something that the government should be working on \u2026 it\u2019s the market that regulates these things.\u201d\nIt is understood the UK government regards the claim that Johnson asked for any help with food supplies as untrue. Publicly, No 10 has issued a more diplomatic retort, saying Bolsonaro\u2019s claims do not tally with Downing Street\u2019s recollection of events. Other senior government sources admitted being taken completely by surprised by the Brazilian president\u2019s claim.\nOne Foreign Office official cast doubt on Bolsonaro\u2019s credibility, and said the prime minister had probably made a warm-hearted but not serious remark about wanting to increase the imports of a particular Brazilian produce to boost the chances of his counterpart agreeing to help drive up the export of whisky.\nSome have speculated the food Brazil could be helpful with supplying is turkeys, after UK poultry producers said serious staff shortages caused by Brexit could mean there would not be enough of the birds to go around this Christmas.\nBrazil has become one of the world\u2019s top turkey meat producers over the last two decades, with production soaring to a record 442,000 tons per year in 2012, according to the industry website Canal Rural. Production has since fallen from that peak, to 159,000 tons last year, about 26% of which was exported. But the South American country remains one of the world\u2019s leading producers.\nOn Thursday, Johnson\u2019s deputy spokesperson said fuel and food had a \u201cvery resilient supply chain\u201d in the UK. They urged people not to change their behaviour, and stressed: \u201cPeople should continue to buy it as usual.\u201d\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, vowed to \u201cmove heaven and earth\u201d to solve the nationwide shortage of truck drivers. Asked about the Petrol Retailers Association warning drivers to keep a quarter of a tank of fuel in their car in case forecourts ran out, he downplayed the issue and said motorists should \u201ccarry on as normal\u201d and not panic-buy.",

        "content": "Experts say it would make sense to expand 007\u2019s appeal into fresh media but Barbara Broccoli resists call\nJames Bond\u2019s next mission should be a TV spin-off as 007 contemplates his future in the streaming era, according to experts, but the secret agent\u2019s gatekeepers are wary of moving away from the multiplex.\nThe Bond films have proved a consistent draw for millions of cinemagoers since Dr No was released nearly 60 years ago, with the last two entries in the franchise, Skyfall and Spectre, making a combined $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) at the global box office.\nHowever, the rise of Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime is already reshaping Hollywood as studios scramble to launch their own streaming services and spin-offs. Last year, Netflix\u2019s subscriber numbers rose 22% to 203 million while worldwide box office revenues, hammered by Covid, fell by more than two-thirds.\nThe world\u2019s biggest film studio, Disney, has achieved critical success with the Marvel offshoot Wandavision and the Star Wars series The Mandalorian on its Disney+ platform, with streaming experts pointing to Bond as an obvious candidate for the switch to TV after his 26th outing in No Time to Die.\n\nDaniel Craig has played Bond in five films since 2006: Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre and No Time to Die. Here are the latest odds on who will take over as the next 007, as supplied by the bookmaker William Hill.Tom Hardy \u2013 5/2 odds\nHardy is no stranger to action-espionage films, having starred in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Inception and The Dark Knight. The 44-year-old earned plaudits for his role in films such as Mad Max and The Revenant, and notably declined to speak about 007 when rumours first surfaced in 2017.Reg\u00e9-Jean Page \u2013 3/1\nPage, 31, who played the dashing Duke of Hastings in Netflix\u2019s period drama Bridgerton, has been the internet\u2019s choice to land the role amid news that he will star alongside Bond actor Ana de Armas in The Gray Man. In the past year there has been a high demand for Page, who will also feature in Dungeons and Dragons.James Norton \u2013 3/1\nNorton\u2019s Hollywood credentials have continued to grow, from appearances in Grantchester to Happy Valley. The 36-year-old\u2019s turn as Alex Goodman in the crime drama McMafia and more recently in Netflix\u2019s Things Heard & Seen have thrust him further into the spotlight.Luke Evans \u2013 6/1\nEvans, 42, has said he would \u201cjump at the chance\u201d to play Bond. The Welsh actor is best known for his roles as Owen Shaw in Fast and Furious 6 and as Bard the Bowman in The Hobbit. Most recently, he starred alongside Nicole Kidman in Amazon\u2019s Nine Perfect Strangers.Idris Elba \u2013 8/1\nThere has been plenty of chatter ever since Elba, 49, posted a photo on Instagram with that Bond caption back in 2018. Known for his high-octane action stunts in the hit BBC crime drama Luther, many hope he will be the first Black Bond.Henry Cavill \u2013 8/1\nCavill was almost cast as 007 ahead of Craig, having auditioned for Casino Royale. With much being made of the suitability of the 38-year-old\u2019s muscular physique and his turn as Superman, the time could be ripe for him to take up the mantle of 007.Suranne Jones \u2013 9/1\nJones, the star of the BBC\u2019s underwater thriller Vigil, has been added to the list of potential candidates. The 43-year-old, who plays DCI Amy Silva in the drama, also won plaudits for her roles in the BBC\u2019s Dr Foster and Gentleman Jack.Lashana Lynch \u2013 10/1\nThere were rumours that Craig\u2019s current co-star Lashana Lynch, 33, was being set up as the next Bond, but it\u2019s since been revealed she\u2019s playing an agent in her own right.Henry Golding \u2013 25/1\nThe Crazy Rich Asians star could become the first British-Asian Bond, having described the vacancy as an \u201copportunity for change\u201d. Golding, 34, has said he\u2019s more than happy to play Bond.Jodie Comer \u2013 200/1\nThe 28-year-old Killing Eve star could be in the running after declaring her willingness to play Villanelle in a Bond crossover, particularly with the Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge as one of the lead Bond screenwriters.\nOther names that have been touted include the Game of Thrones and Bodyguard star Richard Madden, The Night Manager's Tom Hiddleston and Peaky Blinders' Cillian Murphy.\n\u201cThere is always value in expanding the universe of IP due to superfans and audiences for different mediums,\u201d says Andrew Uerkwitz of the US financial firm Jefferies, who adds that Marvel\u2019s successful move into films, TV and video games indicates the potential.\n\u201cIt would make sense to do the same with the Bond series.\u201d\nSingling out Disney\u2019s TV success with the Marvel and Star Wars brands, Michael Pachter, a Netflix analyst at the investment firm Wedbush Securities, says: \u201cI think that valuable IP [intellectual property] and valuable brands can be very successful if used across multiple formats. And absolutely, Bond is that valuable because it has lasted nearly 60 years. It\u2019s a lasting franchise.\u201d\nExpectations of a Bond spin-off were raised this year when Amazon bought the studio that distributes the franchise, MGM, for $8.5bn (\u00a36.2bn). This gave Jeff Bezos\u2019s e-commerce behemoth co-ownership of the films with Eon Productions, a family-run business controlled by Barbara Broccoli \u2013 the daughter of the original Bond producer, Albert R Broccoli \u2013 and her half-brother Michael G Wilson.\nEon retains creative control of the franchise, right down to who plays Bond, the marketing campaigns behind the films and whether 007 appears in a mini-series. So far, Broccoli and Wilson have ruled out a TV foray, even with the backing of a new business partner that is spending $465m alone on one series of its Lord of the Rings TV adaptation.\nWhen Total Film asked Broccoli this year whether she was against a spin-off, she said: \u201cYou got it. We make films. We make films for the cinema. That\u2019s what we do.\u201d Wilson added: \u201cWe\u2019ve resisted that call for 60 years.\u201d\nOne British producer with experience of making programmes for streamers, meanwhile, suggests a TV 007 could be construed as \u201cBond-lite\u201d.\n\u201cOne of the unique selling points of Bond is it is sumptuous and at massive scale,\u201d says Kate Harwood, the managing director of Euston Films, which has made shows for the US streaming service Hulu.\n\u201cI say this with love, but you wouldn\u2019t want to be turning it into Spooks, or [Amazon\u2019s] Jack Ryan. They\u2019re great but doing it with Bond I think you would be cruising for a bruising. It is a brand, a movie brand, but of course you could. But it is not about could. With the Marvel Universe there are lots of different characters and producers can go in at many different levels, but there is only one Bond.\u201d\nInstead, Bezos and Amazon \u2013 which has 200 million Prime subscribers worldwide \u2013 are likely to focus on other MGM properties among the newly acquired studio\u2019s 17,000 TV shows and 4,000 films, which include the Rocky series, Legally Blonde, The Pink Panther and Robocop.\nAnnouncing the deal in May, Bezos said he looked forward to \u201creimagining\u201d MGM\u2019s vast back catalogue for the 21st Century.\nBut for the James Bond franchise, the next reincarnation will be whoever replaces Daniel Craig \u2013 on the big screen.\nFranchises are not just the backbone of today\u2019s cinema but its entire eco-skeleton. Yet how film-makers navigate the evolution of a known brand without alienating nostalgists can decide whether they are set for life or cancelled for ever.\nBond\u2019s gatekeepers can take inspiration from the happy makeover of one of MGM\u2019s key brands. Forty years after Sylvester Stallone\u2019s pugilist threw his first punch, the studio released Creed, starring Black Panther\u2019s Michael B Jordan, directed by the Oscar-nominated Ryan Coogler, and featuring Stallone \u2013 and many of the original cast in supporting roles. The strong dotted line to the first films sated fans and kept things kosher, but the franchise was successfully freshened, diversified and lent real credibility by the canny choice of the cast and crew.\nSubstantial revenue lies untapped in the JK Rowling\u2019s universe, currently hobbled by controversies surrounding the author\u2019s own views, and the tarnished reputation of Johnny Depp, the star of the prequel series Fantastic Beasts (replaced by Mads Mikkelsen for the third instalment). Further diversification will be a prerequisite to bring along the generation that grew up with the first Harry Potter films. The eventual transfer of Rowling\u2019s Cursed Child sequel stage plays to the cinema requires immaculate management.\nMGM\u2019s chief untapped asset is the slapstick classics starring Peter Sellers as a hapless detective \u2013 which for a younger audience may play like relics from an unimaginably baffling (and dubious) era. Yet this lack of brand awareness may be an advantage for a modern update: clear blue water can easily be pumped between any new iteration and the movies still revisited by a substantially older generation.\nHardcore Star Wars fans are second only to James Bond devotees when it comes to keeping the film-makers up to speed with their suggestions. But while Daniel Craig\u2019s appointment sparked a relatively inoffensive blog outraged by the prospect of a blond Bond, many of the new Star Wars cast \u2013 were subject to large-scale racist hate campaigns. How the franchise can evolve while keeping traditionalist aficionados on side presents a considerable challenge.\nThe unlikely success of the soapy saga about a group of ethnically mixed pals in small vests and whopping motors will finally run out of gas in 2024, with a two-part, 10th film finale. Creative later hires such as Jason Statham, Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren have broadened the appeal, but the post-2024 future looks uncertain, with most of the key cast then well into their 50s. A series featuring their sprogs seems the obvious initial offering; a stage transfer involving huge trucks met with mixed reviews.",

Director Nadia Fall\u2019s revival (the first in London since its premiere) feels different. This is still a play about two profoundly lost men but the women in their lives \u2013 despite rarely appearing on stage \u2013 are more prominent, and it is their pain that begins to seep into the endless lonely silences.\nFall doesn\u2019t force a feminist agenda but lets the two central characters, widower John and ex-priest turned therapist Ian, sink themselves. Brendan Coyle plays John, a rep for a catering supplier, as a middle-of-the-road man in a middle-of-the-road suit. He\u2019s a bit cheeky and a bit broken, but basically seems one of the good guys.\nYet as John\u2019s story unfolds, what starts as a counselling session starts to feel more like a confession. Flashes of anger flare up \u2013 towards his wife, his mistress, a sex worker \u2026 the (all-female) list continues. All these women\u2019s stories are told only to embellish his own. John proudly describes his mistress\u2019s looks as \u201ctop five\u201d and when he mentions her miscarriage, it somehow becomes about his pain. When John suggests his dead wife might be haunting him so that she might \u201csave him\u201d, the sheer narcissism of it all takes the breath away.\nTherapist Ian, played with intriguing ambiguity by Rory Keenan, is more disturbing still. When his fiancee (Michelle Fox) whirls in, demanding he return home to his family and baby, Ian speaks with a cool composure and stands by the window, bathed in an almost celestial light. There is a gentle grin stretched across his face, but an awful lot of rage, resentment and repression lurking beneath that glazed contentment.\nThe only drawback is that everything is played just a beat too slowly. John\u2019s endless hesitations are so long and plentiful that conversation frequently almost grinds to a halt. There are also some clunky scene changes for designer Peter McKintosh\u2019s dilapidated set, which provide us with a breather just when all that pain should be wrapping its way around us, and pulling tight.\nAt Theatre Royal Stratford East, London, until 23 October",

The figure is the highest ever recorded; it was 27% in October 2020 and 17% in March this year.\nHalf of casualty wards were also having to treat patients in corridors every day, added Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which carried out the survey. The proportion was 17% in October 2020 and 14% in March this year.\nAs a result, patients in some emergency departments were having to wait more than 48 hours for a bed, with hospitals across the country seeing unprecedented levels of demand, Henderson warned.\nThe Guardian can also disclose that a hospital trust had to cancel non-urgent operations this week and declare an internal critical incident. In a message to staff on Monday, Tracy Bullock, the chief executive of University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS trust, said that as a result of \u201cunprecedented pressures\u201d on its hospitals in Stoke and Stafford, \u201cwe have made the extraordinary decision to cancel all non-urgent operations for two weeks\u201d.\nAs well as typical A&E cases such as car accidents and heart attacks returning to pre-pandemic levels, emergency doctors were seeing four new groups of patients, Henderson said.\nThey included patients who had missed out on treatment for 18 months during the pandemic and had become seriously ill, and people on elective treatment lists who were \u201cstressed and fed up with waiting\u201d as their condition deteriorated.\nThere had also been a significant increase in mental health admissions to A&E, particularly among young people, she said, as well as children presenting with viral infections \u201cwhose parents have maybe never experienced their young child being unwell because they\u2019ve been in lockdown\u201d.\nThe soaring numbers of patients in A&E \u2013 coupled with Covid distancing measures that reduce capacity \u2013 mean ambulances arriving at emergency departments with critically ill patients are finding there is \u201cliterally no room in the inn\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThis is a system that is on the edge.\u201d\nThe NHS was short of 15,000 beds it needed to cope with the number of emergency care admissions, she said, adding that the crisis would inevitably lead to an increase in deaths.\nSajid Javid, the health secretary, said this month that pressure on A&Es and increasing hospital admissions could trigger the government\u2019s \u201cplan B\u201d for tackling Covid. However, he declined to put a number on how many cases or admissions.\nMore than 7,500 people are in hospital with Covid in the UK, compared with a peak of nearly 40,000 in January.\nA combination of Covid, demand for other care and staff shortages is undermining the NHS\u2019s drive to tackle the huge backlog of people waiting hospital treatment, which stands at a record 5.61 million.\n\u201cPlanned surgery is being disrupted in hospitals in some parts of the country, due to a mix of pressures hitting the NHS, and local infrastructure and staffing shortages,\u201d said Prof Neil Mortensen, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons. \u201cHospitals need to make plans now, creating surgical hubs and increasing bed capacity, to avert widespread cancellations of operations.\u201d\nDoctors who spoke to the Guardian privately said NHS personnel shortages were worse than usual because of staff sickness and frontline workers quitting for a less stressful life.\nOne lung specialist said: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen staffing be so consistently bad. It\u2019s a combination of Brexit, people quitting and sickness, including lots of colleagues off with long Covid and also those who are isolating.\u201d\nOne children\u2019s intensive care doctor said nine specialist nurses had quit their paediatric ICU since Covid unfolded and none had yet been replaced because of recruitment difficulties. Six had moved to new jobs in less stressful nursing posts outside the hospital, the medic added.\nEarlier this week, surgeons and anaesthetists at University Hospitals Sussex NHS trust wrote to its chief executive to warn that patients were being put at risk because of a lack of staff. In the letter, first reported by the Health Service Journal, they said some patients who needed to undergo an urgent repair to an aneurysm \u2013 a swelling in an artery that can prove fatal \u2013 and cancer surgery had had operations cancelled three times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all too evident from our daily conversations with trust leaders that urgent and emergency care services are under severe pressure,\u201d said Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England.\n\u201cWe are seeing levels of demand usually seen at the height of winter: demand for ambulance services is rocketing and increasing numbers of patients are waiting longer than 12 hours to be admitted. No one should be under any illusions about the scale of the task we face in the months ahead.\u201d\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile hospitals have had to contend with one of the busiest summers ever with 2.9m A&E attendances in June and July, NHS staff have continued to go above and beyond to provide care for patients. The NHS has also set out a 10-point action plan to support local areas with the significant demand so anyone who needs the NHS should come forward through NHS 111 Online so staff can help you with the best option for your care.\u201d",

It follows an almost 18-month delay and four release date changes, and cinema owners are pulling out all the stops to sate demand with the film to be screened in more than 700 cinemas across the UK and Ireland.\nMany of the biggest and most popular sites, such as in London, are playing the 25th instalment of the super-spy franchise in back-to-back sessions from one minute past midnight on Thursday, after advance sales hit pre-pandemic levels.\n\u201cIt is going to be the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic began,\u201d says Tim Richards, the chief executive of Vue, the UK\u2019s third-largest cinema operator. \u201cCovid and changing consumer habits mean there are more advance bookings made now than we used to see, notwithstanding that it looks like Bond is going to have the biggest opening weekend here since Avengers: Endgame in 2019.\u201d\n\nDaniel Craig has played Bond in five films since 2006: Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre and No Time to Die. Here are the latest odds on who will take over as the next 007, as supplied by the bookmaker William Hill.Tom Hardy \u2013 5/2 odds\nHardy is no stranger to action-espionage films, having starred in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Inception and The Dark Knight. The 44-year-old earned plaudits for his role in films such as Mad Max and The Revenant, and notably declined to speak about 007 when rumours first surfaced in 2017.Reg\u00e9-Jean Page \u2013 3/1\nPage, 31, who played the dashing Duke of Hastings in Netflix\u2019s period drama Bridgerton, has been the internet\u2019s choice to land the role amid news that he will star alongside Bond actor Ana de Armas in The Gray Man. In the past year there has been a high demand for Page, who will also feature in Dungeons and Dragons.James Norton \u2013 3/1\nNorton\u2019s Hollywood credentials have continued to grow, from appearances in Grantchester to Happy Valley. The 36-year-old\u2019s turn as Alex Goodman in the crime drama McMafia and more recently in Netflix\u2019s Things Heard & Seen have thrust him further into the spotlight.Luke Evans \u2013 6/1\nEvans, 42, has said he would \u201cjump at the chance\u201d to play Bond. The Welsh actor is best known for his roles as Owen Shaw in Fast and Furious 6 and as Bard the Bowman in The Hobbit. Most recently, he starred alongside Nicole Kidman in Amazon\u2019s Nine Perfect Strangers.Idris Elba \u2013 8/1\nThere has been plenty of chatter ever since Elba, 49, posted a photo on Instagram with that Bond caption back in 2018. Known for his high-octane action stunts in the hit BBC crime drama Luther, many hope he will be the first Black Bond.Henry Cavill \u2013 8/1\nCavill was almost cast as 007 ahead of Craig, having auditioned for Casino Royale. With much being made of the suitability of the 38-year-old\u2019s muscular physique and his turn as Superman, the time could be ripe for him to take up the mantle of 007.Suranne Jones \u2013 9/1\nJones, the star of the BBC\u2019s underwater thriller Vigil, has been added to the list of potential candidates. The 43-year-old, who plays DCI Amy Silva in the drama, also won plaudits for her roles in the BBC\u2019s Dr Foster and Gentleman Jack.Lashana Lynch \u2013 10/1\nThere were rumours that Craig\u2019s current co-star Lashana Lynch, 33, was being set up as the next Bond, but it\u2019s since been revealed she\u2019s playing an agent in her own right.Henry Golding \u2013 25/1\nThe Crazy Rich Asians star could become the first British-Asian Bond, having described the vacancy as an \u201copportunity for change\u201d. Golding, 34, has said he\u2019s more than happy to play Bond.Jodie Comer \u2013 200/1\nThe 28-year-old Killing Eve star could be in the running after declaring her willingness to play Villanelle in a Bond crossover, particularly with the Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge as one of the lead Bond screenwriters.\nOther names that have been touted include the Game of Thrones and Bodyguard star Richard Madden, The Night Manager's Tom Hiddleston and Peaky Blinders' Cillian Murphy.\nRichards said Vue, which is showing the film in all 91 of its venues, has had to increase staff numbers by about 10%, adding about 450 new employees to its 4,500 regular workforce, to handle Bondmania.\nWhile no one expects No Time To Die to come near Avengers: Endgame \u2013 the highest grossing film of all-time made \u00a331.4m in its UK opening weekend and \u00a343.4m over four days from its Thursday premiere in April 2019 \u2013 it looks set to be one of the biggest Bond films ever.\n\u201cWe sold more [advance] tickets to No Time To Die in 24 hours than we did for Spectre in a month,\u201d says Richards. \u201cTo be even-handed, there are now significant increases in advance bookings, but it is still tracking to be bigger than Spectre.\u201d\nIn 2015, Spectre made \u00a395m at the UK box office and $880m globally, making it the second-biggest film in the franchise after 2012\u2019s Skyfall, which made \u00a3103m domestically and $1.1bn worldwide.\nCraig\u2019s last outing as Bond will, without question, be the biggest film of the year in the UK, but it remains to be seen if 007 has the ability to bring back the global movie-going masses still hesitant to return to cinemas due to the pandemic.\n\u201cSince only one Bond film has ever grossed $1bn I\u2019m not really going out on a limb here by saying No Time To Die won\u2019t reach that box office bull\u2019s eye in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d says Jeff Bock, a senior box office analyst at the industry analyst Exhibitor Relations. \u201cIn fact, with only one domestic release topping half that in 2021, just getting halfway there would be an achievement.\u201d\nTo be the biggest film of the year, No Time to Die would have to overtake the Chinese comedy Hi, Mom, which has made $822m, and F9, the latest in the Fast & Furious franchise, which has pulled in $716m.",

The BRC said the driver crisis, which has been blamed on both Covid-19 and Brexit, had left the country without the \u201cglue\u201d that held crucial supply chains together.\n\u201cWithout them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops,\u201d said Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability. \u201cUnless a solution can be found in the next 10 days, it is inevitable that we will see significant disruption in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d\nOne petrol industry source said they feared it \u201ccould be weeks\u201d before fuel supplies return to normal, although they stressed that shortages were at present affecting only a minority of forecourts.\nAs the government sought to alleviate the problem, figures from the Office of National Statistics revealed that millions of people were already struggling to find the products they were looking for. The ONS said a quarter of British people had reported gaps on supermarket shelves over the past two weeks, with one in six reporting difficulty in finding \u201cessential\u201d items.\nSix in 10 people had noticed differences when food shopping, most commonly a lack of variety in the products available. Four in 10 said they couldn\u2019t find everything they wanted to buy.\nRelatively few people, 4%, reported being unable to get hold of fuel or medicine, but 13% reported waiting longer than usual for prescriptions.\nHauliers, who have repeatedly called for short-term visas to fix the delivery crisis, gave a cautious welcome to the apparent climbdown.\n\u201cThis would be a welcome commitment from the government after we\u2019ve consistently said firms need to be able to hire drivers from overseas to plug gaps in the short term,\u201d said Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the RHA. \u201cIt won\u2019t resolve the driver shortage on its own, but is a step in the right direction. Much more needs to be done on training, apprenticeships, testing and welfare facilities for drivers.\u201d\nTrade associations representing all areas of the UK\u2019s food chain \u2013 including the National Farmers Union, the Road Haulage Association, the Food and Drink Federation and the British Meat Processors Association \u2013 have previously proposed a special one-year visa that would allow workers to enter the UK to fill vacancies for lorry drivers, as well as butchers, chefs and other food industry roles.\nAbout 25,000 HGV drivers from the EU left during 2020 and did not return, while there is also a backlog of 40,000 people waiting to take their HGV tests. The current workforce is also ageing, with an average age of 57.\nProminent Brexit supporters in business and economics insisted that the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union was not to blame. Tim Martin, the boss of pub chain Wetherspoons, told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ve always argued that a reasonably liberal immigration policy is a social and economic plus for the UK. A sensible reciprocal visa system, similar to Australia\u2019s with the UK, would benefit both parties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete cobblers to characterise immigration as being antithetical to Brexit. It\u2019s not \u2013 all successful economies recognise the need for sensible immigration policies \u2013 although to be fair, I am not sure whether the government understands this.\u201d\nMartin\u2019s criticism echoes the dismay expressed by Lord Wolfson, the Brexit-backing boss of retailer Next, who has called Britain\u2019s immigration policy \u201cinsane\u201d and blamed the Home Office for preventing lorry drivers coming to the UK.\nGerard Lyons, a Brexit-supporting economist and former adviser to Boris Johnson, said that low pay and red tape in the training and licensing process for lorry drivers were the key reasons for the shortage, but admitted Brexit was a factor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about higher pay to attract people back into it [HGV driving], fast-forwarding the process by which people can train and obtain a licence, and then, if necessary, on top of that, easing visa restrictions.\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s some impact from Brexit, but that needs to be put in context. If one believes that\u2019s the trigger for this, one will misdiagnose the problem and not come up with the solution. \u201cIt would be wrong to go straight to visa restrictions being eased, because it\u2019s a multitude of issues.\u201d\nThe Road Haulage Association said the government was not taking the problem seriously enough. \u201cThe average age of a truck driver in the UK is 57. Every day this problem is just getting worse as more and more retire,\u201d said Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy and public affairs at the RHA.\nPetrol companies highlighted figures showing that only a fraction of the UK\u2019s 8,386 petrol stations had been affected.\nBP raised the alarm earlier this week, saying it had closed some forecourts and was experiencing shortages of certain grades of fuel at others, as its logistics supplier Hoyer wrestled with staff shortages. Hoyer is understood to have up to 450 drivers delivering fuel to BP on any given day, about 20 fewer than it needs. Between 50 and 100 of the 1,200 BP-branded forecourts are missing at least one grade of fuel, while around 20 are shut.\nEsso said a \u201csmall number\u201d of the 200 petrol stations it operates with Tesco were affected, but that it could not comment on approximately 1,000 that have the company\u2019s branding but are operated independently.\n\u201cWe are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe apologise to our customers for any inconvenience.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Shell, whose branding appears on 1,100 petrol stations, said: \u201cWe are seeing an increased demand today for fuel at some of our stations, which may in some instances result in larger queues. We are adapting our delivery schedules to ensure sufficient supplies for our customers.\u201d",

In an emotional to-camera piece at the time, Cuomo said: \u201cMy advice to my brother was simple and consistent on what you did. Tell people what you\u2019ll do to be better, be contrite, and finally accept that it doesn\u2019t matter what you intended. What matters is how your actions and words were perceived.\u201d\nRoss, who was for a while Cuomo\u2019s boss as an executive producer of his Primetime Live program at ABC, said the incident happened at a colleague\u2019s leaving party. Cuomo joined CNN in 2013 and has become one of the network\u2019s main stars.\n\u201cI was at the party with my husband, who sat behind me on an ottoman sipping his Diet Coke as I spoke with work friends,\u201d Ross said in the Times article.\n\u201cWhen Mr Cuomo entered the Upper West Side bar, he walked toward me and greeted me with a strong bear hug while lowering one hand to firmly grab and squeeze the cheek of my buttock.\n\u201c\u2018I can do this now that you\u2019re no longer my boss,\u2019 he said to me with a kind of cocky arrogance. \u2018No you can\u2019t,\u2019 I said, pushing him off me at the chest while stepping back, revealing my husband, who had seen the entire episode at close range. We quickly left.\u201d\nReached Thursday night by the Times, Cuomo issued a statement. \u201cAs Shelley acknowledges, our interaction was not sexual in nature. It happened 16 years ago in a public setting when she was a top executive at ABC. I apologized to her then, and I meant it.\u201d\nRoss said she did not want Cuomo to lose his job. \u201cI hope he stays at CNN forever if he chooses,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI would, however, like to see him journalistically repent: agree on air to study the impact of sexism, harassment and gender bias in the workplace, including his own, and then report on it.\u201d\nInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

        "content": "Disruptive protesters will face serious consequences, says judge in sentencing Extinction Rebellion activist\nA British Paralympic gold medallist has been jailed for a year for glueing himself to the roof of a passenger jet in an Extinction Rebellion protest \u2013 the first custodial sentence for any action linked to the group.\nXR said it was \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by the sentence handed to James Brown, 56, at Southwark crown court in London on Friday afternoon, by a judge who warned that protesters who disrupt people\u2019s lives \u201cwill face serious consequences\u201d.\nJudge Gregory Perrins said Brown, from Exeter, who has been registered blind since birth, \u201ccynically used\u201d his disability and put his own life at risk when he staged his protest at London City airport on 10 October 2019, at at the height of XR\u2019s second extended campaign of protests in London.\nThat day, as hundreds of other XR protesters demonstrated at the airport in protest at expansion plans, Brown had climbed on top of a plane heading to Amsterdam, glued his right hand to its fuselage and wedged his phone in a door frame. He spent an hour livestreaming his protest before he was removed.\nBrown\u2019s trial at Southwark crown court heard his direct action led to 337 passengers missing their flights, and that it cost British Airways about \u00a340,000.\nConducting his own defence, Brown said he aimed to draw media attention to the climate crisis. He wept as he told jurors: \u201cI was prepared to challenge myself, to be scared, to face the fear, because the fear of climate ecological breakdown is so much greater.\u201d\nHe was found guilty of causing a public nuisance by a jury after less than an hour\u2019s deliberation.\nAs Perrins passed sentence on Friday, he told Brown: \u201cIt is important that those who are tempted to seriously disrupt the lives of ordinary members of the public, in the way that you did, and then seek to justify it in the name of protest, understand that they will face serious consequences.\u201d\nThe judge said he accepted Brown was acting according to his conscience. He also said he recognised there must be \u201csome sense of proportion\u201d when sentencing people who commit offences during a protest. But, he told Brown: \u201cYou are not entitled to more lenient treatment simply because you were protesting about environmental matters as opposed to some other cause.\u201d\nThere were cries of \u201cshame\u201d from the public gallery as Brown was taken down to the cells. Brown\u2019s solicitor, Raj Chada, of Hodge Jones Allen, said there would be an appeal against the sentence. \u201cThis is a dangerous judgment for our right to free speech, our right to protest and for those who campaign on environmental issues,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are shocked and devastated by this news,\u201d said Alannah Byrne, a spokesperson for XR, who called Brown \u201ca hero\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cTo put a partially blind man in jail while the prime minister quotes Kermit the Frog to the UN and recruits the Wombles as the Cop [climate talks] mascots, shows what a mockery our leaders are making of this moment.\u201d\nJudge Perrins\u2019 warning came after the climate protesters Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, blocked the port of Dover, in Kent, on Friday, following five blockades of the M25 in the past fortnight.",

This issue, which impacted a number of ports of entry, has since been resolved and the e-gates at Heathrow are back up and running again.\n\u201cOur teams remain on hand and are working with Border Force to monitor the situation, and to get passengers on their way as quickly as possible.\u201d",

        "content": "Minister who co-wrote free-market book now holds more nuanced views, say those who know him\nAlmost a decade ago, a young Conservative MP co-wrote a lengthy tract about what the authors saw as the glorious power of the free market and deregulation.\nThat was Kwasi Kwarteng, who is now in the cabinet as business secretary, alongside three of his fellow co-authors \u2013 Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and Liz Truss.\nIn the book, titled Britannia Unchained, they said Britons were among \u201cthe worst idlers\u201d in the world and called on the UK to emulate the hard work ethic of Asia. \u201cToo many people in Britain, we argue, prefer a lie-in to hard work,\u201d they said.\nOften portrayed as a rightwing Thatcherite on account of that controversial tome, Kwarteng has, according to those who know him, become more nuanced in his views over time.\nHe has joked, since first entering the business department, that a stint as energy minister helped him \u201clearn the virtues of state intervention\u201d as a way of kick-starting markets.\nUnder Boris Johnson, who is sometimes no opponent of muscular state involvement in business, Kwarteng has already been forced to order a bailout of the faltering CO2 market and an investigation into the takeover of the British defence firm Ultra Electronics by a US private equity company on national security grounds.\nOne person who has worked for him said Kwarteng was \u201cvery good at making decisions, perhaps too decisive \u2013 no one could say he is indecisive whatsoever\u201d.\nThey said he was hardworking \u2013 \u201can 8am to 8pm sort of person, or even more when necessary\u201d \u2013 and had \u201cthe best grasp over the English language of anyone\u201d they knew.\nKwarteng, now 46, was born in Waltham Forest and educated at a state primary school, before winning a scholarship to Eton, then studying at Cambridge, where he gained a PhD, and Harvard. In 1995, he was part of Trinity College Cambridge\u2019s winning team on University Challenge, when he was heard muttering \u201cfuck\u201d while trying to recall an answer.\nAfter a stint as a Telegraph columnist and financial analyst, Kwarteng was elected MP for Spelthorne in Surrey in 2010 and spent several years on select committees and then as a ministerial bag carrier, known as a parliamentary private secretary.\nColleagues say he failed to win preferment in the years of the coalition after annoying Downing Street by calling for tax cuts and criticising the chancellor\u2019s help-to-buy housing scheme as inflationary.\nDuring this time, he went on many fact-finding missions paid for by Tory donors and foreign governments. Kwarteng defended the principle of visiting foreign autocratic regimes, saying it offered a greater chance of influencing their behaviour than \u201cshouting from the sidelines without ever setting foot in these places\u201d.\nIn the post-Brexit world, he gained office in the Department for Exiting the European Union in 2018. When appointed business secretary earlier this year, he became the first black British Tory to run a government department.\nHe married a City lawyer two years ago, and the government website lists his passions as history, music and languages, as well as highlighting his authorship of several books, including Ghosts of Empire, War and Gold and Thatcher\u2019s Trial. It makes no mention of Britannia Unchained.",

A 14-year-old girl, who set up the \u201cambush\u201d, and who had admitted manslaughter and perverting the course of justice, was sentenced to three years and two months in a young offender institution. None of the defendants can be named because of their age.\nOlly, as he was known, and who had autism, was lured to a field in Emmer Green, Reading, by the girl on 3 January this year, where he was knifed to death by two of his former friends, whom he had met only online and who were lying in wait.\nSentencing the three, Judge Heather Norton said: \u201cWhat you did was utterly cruel and utterly pointless, you have taken one life and you have damaged your own futures and you have caused so much pain to so many people.\u201d\nStuart Stephens told Reading crown court: \u201cWe are strong enough to deal with most problems thrown our way but this has completely broken us.\u201d\n\u201cOlly trusted people too much, it was part of his makeup, it was part of his autism \u2013 it was why we loved him.\u201d\nHe described the \u201cutterly horrific\u201d moment he was told his son\u2019s body was now forensic evidence, and that he would no longer be able to hold him or touch him.\nHe said: \u201cI had one job as a father, to protect my children, and I failed miserably \u2013 I will never forgive myself\u201d.\n\u201c[Olly] didn\u2019t deserve his fate no matter what he might have said or done, no child deserves such a callous fate.\u201d\nAmanda Stephens said she was unable to understand why none of the teenagers present at the scene of the crime had stepped in to help their son. In a victim impact statement, she said: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t just one of them to step in to stop it happening, why didn\u2019t one care enough to stand up for him?\n\u201cOlly always stood up for the underdog, it got him into trouble, but that was just him.\u201d\nThe trial previously heard that Olly was convinced to go to Bugs Bottom field near his home in Emmer Green, by the girl, where he was then \u201cambushed\u201d and stabbed to death by the boys, who both had \u201cgrievances\u201d with him.\nJurors were told Olly\u2019s killers had shared several hostile messages about him on Snapchat in the days leading up to the stabbing.\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Olly\u2019s parents urged the parents of teenage children to \u201ctake their phones off them\u201d after warning how social media \u201cplayed a massive part\u201d in their son\u2019s death. They also called for new laws to be introduced to ban unidentifiable social media accounts.\nHis father recalled how he detected Olly was troubled by something in the days prior to his murder, and pleaded with his son to confide in him. \u201cI said to him: it\u2019s my job to protect you, you need to tell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get it out of him \u2013 \u2018Snitches get stitches\u2019 is all he\u2019d say.\u201d",

Sign up now!\nFriday\u2019s news that the ban on fans guzzling amber pints of foaming shaft and other forms of electric soup in the stands at football matches could soon be lifted prompted an array of predictable responses on social media disgraces. First out of the traps were the Fun Police, that body of self-appointed moral guardians who believe that because they feel no compulsion to enjoy a bevvy while enjoying themselves at the football, any other grown adults who do are obviously some sort of anti-social dipsomaniac who should consider hot-footing it to their local branch of Alcoholics Anonymous.\nOthers tut-tutted for different reasons, pointing out that giving people free rein to get their booze on either side of half-time during matches would lead to scenes of extreme drunkenness and the kind of loutish anti-social behaviour of a kind not seen since \u2026 ah, the Not Euro 2020 final at Wembley, where fans were not allowed to drink in their own or whoever else\u2019s seats they happened to be in but a good number somehow managed to have an astronomical blood alcohol level anyway. Other more sensible folk welcomed the news, even if the sale of ale for the duration of matches means more time spent away from the game either getting the drinks in or at the toilets, causing all manner of inconvenience to fellow fans who have to stand up and let you scooch past as you go about your business. Then there were fans of teams from the fifth tier downwards, long trusted to drink during games and shocked to learn that those in divisions above are not afforded the same courtesy.\nLifting football\u2019s 36-year ban on fans farming the foam during matches is expected to be among the key recommendations of Tracey Crouch\u2019s fan-led review next month, a wheeze in which the MP will push for a pilot scheme to keep the shutters up and the bar-staff at National League and League Two clubs busy manning the pumps for the duration of games. All going well, it would subsequently be extended to the divisions above, where clubs are not as reliant on bar receipts to keep their heads above water. \u201cTake a club like Dulwich Hamlet, in National League South,\u201d Crouch told the Times. \u201cIts revenue is generated through its refreshments. If it gets promoted to the National League Premier [which operates under the alcohol ban], it effectively stops generating that revenue during a game. They said openly in evidence to us that they cannot afford to get promoted because of the rules around alcohol.\u201d\nWhile The Fiver has no strong feelings either way on the alcohol ban because there are far more pressing fan concerns which need to be addressed, if we were to write a strong polemic on the subject, we\u2019d probably come down on the side of any development that helps eliminate nanny-statism and allows grown adults to have a beer if they feel like having a beer. The Fiver has been to \u2013 and been drunk at \u2013 enough football matches to know that drinkers are gonna drink and if they wish to glug to the point where their knees buckle and they can no longer see, they will do exactly that whether or not the bar is open from first to final whistle. Now pardon us as we oil our beard and make our way to Champion Hill, purveyors of the finest modestly priced triple-brewed and oak-aged 26% Moldovan chocolate and peanut butter stout suffused with fennel your favourite daily football email has ever imbibed.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t trust Mike Jones with Manchester United v Liverpool. He didn\u2019t have the skill set, he didn\u2019t have the experience, the players wouldn\u2019t respect him. He\u2019d be near the top of the merit table because if you\u2019re refereeing Southampton v Watford, last on Match of the Day, the exposure is zero\u201d \u2013 Mark Clattenburg sticks the boot into a former Premier League colleague for no good reason other than perhaps he needs work now he\u2019s back from Saudi Arabia and China.\n\u201cEvery day in my dotage I search frantically for footie entertainment value on the idiot box. Yesterday, however, I began to question my research parameters, wasting two valuable hours watching ageing defensive midfielders at Old Trafford blatantly undress opponents and knee them in the unmentionables, as Jon Moss emphatically enforced the new free-flowing regulations.

But I feel helpless. I have written to my MP, who says that he and his colleagues \u201cwill continue to press\u00a0the government to think again\u201d. Unobjectionable but clearly ineffective.\nIs the opposition so cowed that it cannot effectively demonstrate that it really cares? If words don\u2019t work, isn\u2019t it time to take some action, disrupt parliamentary procedure, organise demonstrations of public solidarity with the most vulnerable people in our society, or even have the courage for civil disobedience? This cruel threat to hurt the poorest people has to be resisted, and if not by the opposition, then by whom? The government is counting on the inability of the victims of their cruelty to organise themselves, and\u00a0on the docility of opposition parties. How cowardly and\u00a0despicable. David Evans Exeter\n We wish to express our profound concern about the government\u2019s plan to withdraw the \u00a320 uplift to universal credit as of 1 October (The \u00a320 benefit cut is the most morally indefensible thing I\u2019ve seen in politics, 22 September). Analysis from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates that this action will result in 500,000 more people falling into poverty, including 200,000 children, even before taking into account the effects of the increase in fuel prices and national\u00a0insurance. Many of those affected are the very people who have already suffered disproportionately from Covid-19. This is simply unacceptable and a stain on our society. We call on the government to rescind this proposal with immediate effect.

The decision by his Red Bull team leaves Lewis Hamilton in the best possible position to retake the lead of the Formula One world championship at the Sochi Autodrom.\nVerstappen was already set to take a three-place grid penalty for causing a collision when he hit Hamilton at the last round in Monza. His team have decided that given they were going to have to take a new power unit at some point, absorbing the hit in Russia, a circuit where they expected Mercedes to be on top, was their best option.\nVerstappen will be hopeful he can get through the field, especially with rain expected on both Saturday and Sunday. However with only a five-point lead over Hamilton, the world champion will expect to regain the championship lead, not least at a track where Mercedes have not been beaten since the race was first held here in 2014.\nRed Bull are taking their full set of power unit components, their fourth of the season, one more than is allowed in the regulations. They have been unhappy about having to do so given that one of Verstappen\u2019s engines was damaged in his crash at Silverstone for which Hamilton was found to be predominantly at fault. They had to absorb the financial hit from the accident, which the team put at $1.8m, a serious blow given F1\u2019s budget cap and now the penalty from their engine damage.\n\u201cWe have to take the penalty anyway,\u201d said Verstappen. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t taken it here we would have taken it somewhere else. So we thought we\u2019ll decide to do it here and we\u2019ll try to make the best of it in the race.\u201d\nEngine performance does deteriorate with use and manufacturer Honda have also fitted a new specification energy store to the power unit, but with Verstappen at the back the real benefit will be felt at the next round in Turkey.\nHamilton is now the only driver from the championship contenders Red Bull and Mercedes who has not taken a fourth engine with eight races still planned to be held and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said they had no plans to do so as yet.\nWith Mercedes looking very strong at Sochi in practice the world champion was optimistic that they could convert their form to a vital win. Certainly it will be expected that teammate Valtteri Bottas will give way to Hamilton to ensure he scores maximum points.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough year for everyone with reliability,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a shame for him [Verstappen] and we\u2019ve got to try and capitalise on that and get a maximum result, a one-two would be spectacular for us as a team.\u201d\nThe British driver, however, did once more have an issue with his \u201cmagic\u201d brake bias switch during second practice. On returning to the pits he had the system, which shifts the brake bias to the front wheels still activated and consequently did not come to a stop as expected, knocking over his front jack operator in his pit box. A similar error with the switch in Baku earlier this year cost him a potential win when he locked up and went off.\nFor Verstappen and Red Bull, damage limitation with a view to taking advantage of their new power unit in subsequent rounds is paramount. Sochi is a circuit where overtaking is possible and in 2018 Verstappen made a mighty charge here from 19th on the grid to fifth. However he was circumspect about his chances of doing similar this weekend. \u201cIn 2018 the gaps to the midfield were a bit bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo naturally it will be a bit more difficult to come though.\u201d\nFurther complications may also be imposed by the weather, with rain expected all afternoon on Saturday and the FIA is understood to be preparing plans to hold qualifying on Sunday morning if required.\nBottas was quickest for Mercedes in first practice, two-tenths in front of Hamilton and Verstappen. The Finn was on top in the second session, once more completing a Mercedes one-two with Hamilton, while Verstappen, now using his new power unit, was sixth.",

The event also paid tribute to the US Open wheelchair doubles champions, Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid, and the men\u2019s doubles champion, Joe Salisbury,\nWhen asked if she were more nervous playing the duchess or Leylah Fernandez, her opponent in the final in New York, Raducanu smiled and said: \u201cI was actually very nervous playing the duchess. I was like: \u2018Don\u2019t miss, don\u2019t miss\u2019!\u201d\nRaducanu said she had discussed her victory with the duchess and what it meant for the country. \u201cShe was very supportive, and it was great to play tennis with her \u2026 She has a great game and actually an incredible forehand.\u201d\nRaducanu, who two weeks\u2019 ago became the first British woman to win a grand slam single\u2019s title since 1977, then showed her ruthless side by revealing she had dispensed with the coach who had worked with her for the US Open.\nShe explained the decision to leave Andrew Richardson, who took over after she reached the fourth round of Wimbledon, was down to the need to find a coach with high-level experience on the women\u2019s tour to help her compete with the very best.\n\u201cThe players at the top are serious competition and serious players so I feel like I really need someone who has been through that and can really guide me along the way, because I\u2019m still very very new to everything,\u201d she said.\nRaducanu, whose journey from 400-1 qualifier to grand slam champion charmed the world, said she had watched her final victory on a few occasions but it had still not completely hit home.\n\u201cThe first time I watched it back, I actually skipped all the bad bits,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI just wanted to see what was going on from a spectator\u2019s point of view. It was really cool to watch and it helped the victories sink in a bit more.\u201d\nRaducanu has since rubbed shoulders with A-list stars at the Met Gala, agreed a sponsorship deal with Tiffany, and made a glamorous appearance at London fashion week. But she said her favourite moment of the past fortnight was the quiet meal she had shared with her team after her victory.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had many cool opportunities but I\u2019d say the nicest moment \u2013 and the best moment \u2013 was after the final when everyone in the team just had a really nice meal together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe spoke until the early hours of the morning, just reflecting on the fortnight and the three weeks that we had.\nThat was a special moment. It\u2019s the one that really sticks in my head and I\u2019ll probably keep that for ever.\u201d\nThe 18-year-old also confirmed she would be playing tennis full-time rather than going to university but said she would like to do a degree in economics at some point in the future.\n\u201cIt was always in my mind after my A-levels that I wanted to give being on tour full-time a shot. So I gave myself one or two years to see how it was going. But now obviously with the run I\u2019ve had, that\u2019s all I want to do. Maybe when things settle down and I\u2019m more adjusted to what\u2019s going on and the schedule, then I might pick something up if I have a lot of spare time. But at the moment, no.\u201d\nRaducanu would not be drawn on when she would make her return to competitive tennis but said she was now back in full training with a view to her expected comeback next month.\n\u201cBeing at home for a few days is really nice, just to spend time with my family. But while all the opportunities I\u2019m getting have been very fun, where I really want to be is on a tennis court because I was just thriving out there.\u201d",

        "content": "Open warfare with the president and the team\u2019s results and style make it a matter of time before the manager is sacked\nCarlos Del Cerro Grande got there before Joan Laporta could but few expect the Barcelona president to be far behind. It was just before midnight on Thursday when the referee approached the touchline and raised the red card, handing Ronald Koeman his marching orders and everyone else an inescapable metaphor. Now suspended for something he said, the Dutchman may have sat on the Bar\u00e7a bench for the last time, even if he does survive until Sunday\u2019s meeting with Levante at the Camp Nou \u2013 and only the cost of replacing him and the lack of an alternative makes that likely now.\n\u201cIn this country, they throw you out you for nothing,\u201d Koeman said. When it came to the card, he may have had a point; when it comes to the club, there is far more to it than that. This isn\u2019t nothing, this is everything. Down to 10 men after Frenkie de Jong was sent off, it had finished 0-0 at 14th-placed C\u00e1diz, Barcelona\u2019s third consecutive game without a win leaving them seven points behind the leaders, Real Madrid, albeit with a game in hand. They have won only one of their past five and that was an uninspiring 2-1 victory against Getafe, who have lost every game.\n\u201cWhen it opened up, we were more dangerous than them,\u201d the C\u00e1diz coach, \u00c1lvaro Cervera, insisted, having seen his team take twice as many shots. Three days earlier, a last-minute header from Ronald Ara\u00fajo had rescued a point for Bar\u00e7a against Granada, who are in the relegation zone. The game before that was a 3-0 defeat against Bayern Munich, the inferiority so evident the German club felt little need to drive it home. \u201cIt is what it is, we are who we are,\u201d Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said, and Koeman agreed. \u201cYou have to be realistic in life,\u201d he said. And right now the reality is that Barcelona are not very good.\nNor is it just the results, it is the play. After the draw against Granada, Koeman said, \u201cIf you look at the list [of players], what are you supposed to do? Play tiki tiki?\u201d An already dismissive phrase, tiki taka, was made even more disparaging by its misuse and anyway the answer was simple: \u201cWell, yes.\u201d At Cruyff\u2019s club, where its elevation to divine status may be an issue, where the puritanism can be problem, the style is supposed to be sacred. Besides, between a philosophy that supposedly guides everything and this reality there is a chasm.\nAgainst Granada, Barcelona had slung 54 mostly aimless crosses into the box. They had finished with a forward line of Piqu\u00e9, Ara\u00fajo, and Luuk de Jong, the striker Koeman had requested after describing him as \u201cbetter in the air than Neymar\u201d. Against Bayern, they had hidden under the table, put up their guard and just tried to resist; dropping ever deeper, they couldn\u2019t. Against C\u00e1diz, it\u2019s hard to really define what they did except to say: nothing much.\nAfter the Bayern game, Laporta released a short video recorded on a phone, pleading for patience and calm but not exactly expressing it himself. In 30 seconds which lacked his normal charisma he described \u201ca scenario we always anticipated\u201d but also declared himself \u201cindignant and disappointed\u201d, vowing: \u201cWe\u2019ll fix this.\u201d\nThere is still a lot to fix, the problems multilayered and as deep as the \u20ac1.35bn (\u00a31.16bn) debt. There is a reason Barcelona\u2019s best-ever player was forced out \u2013 more than a billion reasons, in fact \u2013 and talk of realism may be reasonable, possibly necessary. But it also risks becoming self-fulfilling, being a discourse that is damaging. It is certainly playing a part in this breakdown.\nThe manager is just part of the crisis but he is the most immediate, even if this situation has long been coming, another problem Laporta inherited. As soon as the president can, he will do what he always wanted to do: sack his coach. His? Theirs. The question is: when can he? And how? Sacking Koeman costs \u20ac12m that Barcelona, who still haven\u2019t paid off Ernesto Valverde or Quique Seti\u00e9n, do not have. In the summer, they also couldn\u2019t find a replacement and doing so is no easier now, although names emerge, Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez the most significant.\nOne thing seems sure, there is no way back for Koeman. The relationship is irretrievable, their differences too profound and public, the fault line growing wider almost by the minute. That was already likely but there were moments along the way where they might have avoided it playing out like this, Piqu\u00e9 having to come out on Thursday night to deliver a long monologue in which he said: \u201cThe friction doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe have been on the crest of a wave and people are not used to this. We need tranquillity and stability. I know it is hard but there are ways of handling this. We can complain or we can all pull in the same direction.\u201d\nA marriage of convenience has become inconvenient. In the summer, Laporta asked Koeman for two weeks to find a better coach but he couldn\u2019t and so they continued together. Before the Bayern game the club even leaked that they were considering offering their coach a contract extension but they also leaked that it would come with \u201cconditions\u201d. He would have to play 4-3-3, Barcelona\u2019s style. There were even suggestions he would have to include the midfielder Riqui Puig, and there was no way he was having that.\nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d were one thing, the reports another. Koeman was annoyed that those stories had been deliberately placed, something that the many briefed media admitted. In an TV programme in the Netherlands, he said Laporta \u201cspeaks too much\u201d. Back in Spain, he admitted that he and Laporta had \u201chad our \u2018little things\u2019\u201d but said it was sorted now. In fact, it was getting worse, Koeman no longer bothering to pretend any more. Defiant, he repeatedly challenged his president.\nOn Wednesday he walked into the press room, put his glasses on and, refusing to take questions, read a 2min 49sec statement demanding backing \u201cin word and deed\u201d. One in which he said that \u201cfinishing in the high positions in the league would be a success\u201d and that they could not expect \u201cmiracles\u201d in the Champions League, turning the screw tighter. The next night, Sergi Roberto responded. \u201cFinishing in the top four is not enough,\u201d he said. Piqu\u00e9 said: \u201cI don\u2019t wear this shirt to finish third. I wear this shirt to win.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is a conformist attitude, a certain defeatism,\u201d Laporta insisted, the battle now open war. \u201cThat can\u2019t be allowed at Barcelona. We can aspire to [win] La Liga.\u201d He said Koeman\u2019s job was not on the line at C\u00e1diz, which was true \u2013 it was no longer about C\u00e1diz, too late for salvation \u2013 but it didn\u2019t help, any sympathy or support slipping away. When he was asked about Koeman\u2019s future, the president had replied: \u201cAll coaches depend on results and, in our case, on the play.\u201d In the end there was neither, just a 0-0 draw and a red card, Barcelona\u2019s manager banished from the bench and forced to walk away, alone.",

        "content": "Women\u2019s Health and Protection Act is part of strategy to push back against rush of state laws but unlikely to advance in Senate\nHouse Democrats voted on Friday to establish a federal right to abortion, moving swiftly to advance the measure after the supreme court declined to stop a Texas law effectively outlawing the procedure and as they await a separate ruling next year that could further erode access.\nThe legislation, named the Women\u2019s Health and Protection Act, is part of the party\u2019s strategy to push back against the rush of state laws restricting abortions and to show their determination to defend reproductive rights, an issue they believe will resonate ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Joe Biden has urged support for the measure, but Republican opposition in the Senate all but ensures the bill will not reach his desk.\nWith the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, presiding over the vote, the House passed the measure 218-211. All Republicans and one Democrat, congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas, opposed the bill.\nThe bill is unlikely to advance in the Senate, where Republican opposition is sure to prevent the measure from winning the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. Nevertheless, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck announced on Friday that he intended to bring the bill to the floor for a vote \u201cin the very near future.\u201d\n\u201cWe are currently seeing unprecedented and unconscionable Republican attacks on reproductive rights across the country laced with vicious vigilantism,\u201d Schumer said in a joint statement with Senate sponsors of the bill. \u201cCongress must assert its role to protect the constitutional right to abortion.\u201d\nThe near-total party line vote reflects a decades-long shift in the Democratic party\u2019s embrace of reproductive issues. While Democratic leaders were once reluctant to bring such measures to the floor out of concern for the more socially conservative members of their caucus, nearly every congressional Democrat supports abortion rights and those who don\u2019t, like Cuellar, have faced increasingly difficult primary challenges.\nThe debate ahead of the vote was passionate and personal, as was expected for what has become one of the most polarizing issues in American politics. Some Democrats recalled the \u201cdark ages\u201d before Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court decision that established a legal right to abortion nationwide.\n\u201cRoe v Wade was not the beginning of women having abortions,\u201d said Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois. \u201cIt was the end of women dying from abortions.\u201d\nCongresswoman Sylvia Garcia, a Democrat of Texas, waved a wire coat hanger as a symbol of the dangerous \u2013 and sometimes deadly \u2013 methods women would use to attempt an abortion before it was legalized.\nRepublicans rose to denounce the bill, arguing that it would allow \u201cabortion on demand\u201d at every stage of pregnancy, even until birth.\nThe measure \u201cisn\u2019t about freedom for women,\u201d said Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, a Republican from Missouri. \u201cIt\u2019s about death for babies.\u201d\nThe legislation would codify abortion rights into federal law and prohibit states from imposing \u201cmedically unnecessary\u201d restrictions that make it difficult to perform and access. It would allow an abortion after viability \u2013 the point at which a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, typically between 21 and 24 weeks \u2013 only in cases where the mother\u2019s health is at risk.\nCongresswoman Judy Chu of California, the lead author of the bill, has introduced versions of this legislation in previous cycles. But Democrats moved to vote on it for the first time after the supreme court refused to intervene to block a Texas law that prohibits abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, roughly the sixth week of pregnancy \u2013 before many women even know they\u2019re pregnant. The court did not address the constitutionality of the law, but many advocates on both sides of the abortion debate viewed the decision as a potential sign of how it might rule in a coming challenge to Roe.\nThe Texas law makes no exemptions for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest. It also effectively deputizes ordinary citizens regardless of where they live to enforce the law, allowing them to collect $10,000 for successfully bring a civil suit against anyone found to \u201caid or abet\u201d an illegal abortion.\nThe Biden administration sued Texas, arguing that the law is clearly unconstitutional. At least two lawsuits have been filed \u2013 one by a man in Arkansas and another by a man in Illinois \u2013 against a doctor in Texas who published an op-ed claiming to have performed an abortion in violation of the new law.\nDemocrats warned of copycat laws popping up in Republican-controlled legislatures across the country. But they are also bracing for a supreme court decision next year, when it will rule on a Mississippi law that seeks to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 a direct challenge to Roe.\nThere is widespread fear among proponents of reproductive rights that the current court, composed of six conservative justices, three of whom Donald Trump appointed to be \u201cpro-life\u201d, could further roll back or entirely dismantle Roe.\n\u201cWe cannot rely on Amy Coney Barrett or Brett Kavanaugh to confirm our rights for us,\u201d Chu said at a press conference on Friday morning. \u201cCongress must protect the rights of women and pregnant people in every zip code.\u201d\nFormidable Republican opposition awaits in the evenly-divided Senate, where it remains unclear if the bill could win the support of all 50 Democrats in the chamber. Two members of the caucus who oppose abortion rights, senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have not co-sponsored the bill.\nOne of only a few remaining pro-abortion Republicans, Senator Susan Collins of Maine told the LA Times she opposes th bill and is working with other senators to craft a bill that would \u201ctruly would codify Roe.\u201d\nPublic opinion polls have consistently found strong support for keeping abortion legal in all or some circumstances.\nThe Biden administration said it \u201cstrongly supports\u201d passage of this bill in light of \u201cTexas\u2019 unprecedented attack\u201d on abortion access.\n\u201cOur daughters and granddaughters deserve the same rights that their mothers and grandmothers fought for and won\u2014and that a clear majority of the American people support,\u201d the White House said in a statement of administration policy. \u201cWe will not allow this country to go backwards on women\u2019s equality.\u201d",

        "content": "A coalition appears inevitable after two surveys suggest almost equal support for CDU and former favourite\nThe race to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor remains completely open two days before western Europe\u2019s most populous country goes to the polls, with the latest predictions showing the leading parties almost neck and neck.\nTwo leading polls published on Friday ahead of Sunday\u2019s election indicate the Social Democrats (SPD) have lost their lead over the Christian Democrats (CDU). One, carried out by Civey for the broadcaster ZDF, showed the SPD to be stable on 25%, but the CDU to have risen to 23%. A poll released later in the day for the polling institute Allensbach for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung showed the race to be even tighter, with the SPD on 26%, the CDU on 25%.\nThe SPD had been on a roll for weeks but has seen its lead whittled down to such a wafer-thin majority that its advantage is in effect non-existent, especially when a statistical margin of error of about 2.5% is also taken into account.\nThe battle for the runner-up is almost as open, and is being followed just as closely by punters, as it could be as, if not more decisive, in determining the make-up of the new government. The Green party is shown in the final polls to be on 16% and the FDP on 10.5% to 12%. The far-right AfD is on 10% followed by the far-left Die Linke on 5% to 6%, which means it is on the verge of not being reelected into parliament.\nHowever, by a considerable margin, the most popular candidate for chancellor remains Olaf Scholz of the SPD, with 47% of those polled saying they would choose him if there was a direct vote for chancellor, while 20% said they were in favour of Armin Laschet of the CDU. Just 16% said they wanted Annalena Baerbock of the Greens.\nA coalition government seems an inevitability and a three-way alliance is highly likely, the first time this will have happened on a national level, in a reflection of the increasing fragmentation of German politics that is also occurring elsewhere in Europe and beyond.\nThe resulting scenario will have wide-reaching consequences for how a new government operates as well as affecting Germany\u2019s future role as a leading voice in Europe. Weeks, if not months, of heated negotiations over forming a new government are expected.\nOn Thursday night, the lead candidates of all seven parties expected to enter the Bundestag met for a final television debate, in which they sparred over the issues that have shaped the campaign, from economic recovery to climate change, pandemic management to energy security. But the gathering was too large, the time each candidate had too brief, to allow any one of them to make a significant impact.\nThe debate followed three previous encounters over the past month with the leaders of the CDU, SPD and Greens, after which audience polls had declared Scholz, the SPD leader, to be the winner on each occasion.\nThursday night\u2019s debate opened with focus on the fatal shooting earlier this week of a petrol station attendant in Rheinland-Palatinate after he had asked a customer to wear the mandatory medical face mask, an incident that has shocked Germany.\nIt triggered discussion on a wide range of security issues including the tightening of gun laws, online hate speech and arguments over the necessity of the coronavirus restrictions still in place across Germany.\nThe collapse in support for the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been the main talking point throughout this campaign, with much blame especially within the conservative alliance itself having been put at the door of its candidate, Laschet, who is also the leader of Germany\u2019s most populous state of North Rhein-Westphalia (NRW).\nHis campaign has been gaffe-prone \u2013 its lowest point came shortly after the floods that wreaked havoc in NRW and neighbouring Rheinland-Palatinate, when Laschet was caught on camera laughing during a moment of remembrance for the more than 180 people who died. His own party is perceived as being drained, empty of innovation or inspiration after 16 years in power under Merkel.\nEven if the CDU catches up on the SPD, it is still on course for one of the worst results in its almost eight-decade history.\nRelative to the CDU, the SPD has appeared to flourish, though even within the party itself its advantage is put down to some extent to a mix of luck and circumstance that could evaporate at any moment. Scholz, as incumbent finance minister who has helped steer the German economy through the pandemic, has presented himself as something of a continuity candidate to Merkel \u2013 even briefly adopting her famous rhomboid hand gesture, which, while meant as a joke, has gone down well with the electorate \u2013 at the same time as promising a change of course and widespread reform.\nHowever, when it comes to the votes it has garnered over the past two decades, the SPD, like the CDU, remains a shadow of its former self as it has haemorrhaged supporters to other parties.\nThe party also remains haunted by the rise and fall of Martin Schulz, the former president of the European parliament who had stood as the party\u2019s chancellor candidate in 2017 and had initially been on a roll before the SPD fell to a postwar low in the election.\nThe Greens have not escaped a bumpy ride throughout the campaign, having dropped from 28% in April after Baerbock was appointed its lead candidate, to 16%. Despite environmental issues being its raison d\u2019\u00eatre, the party has failed to benefit from recent environmental disasters, including Germany\u2019s historic floods. In fact, it has actively resisted appearing to want to do so \u2013 even its own supporters accuse it of having shied away from seizing the reins over outlining the scale and challenge of the climate emergency.\nNevertheless, the Greens are very likely to play a significant role in any new government, in shaping future environmental policy as Germany struggles to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement to reduce its carbon emissions.\nOn Friday, thousands of campaigners for Fridays for Future gathered in Berlin joined by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, accusing the traditional parties of failing to take the climate emergency seriously and demanding the new government do so.\nOne of their key requests is for what it calls \u201cgenerational justice\u201d \u2013 young people make up the smallest group of voters and parties are perceived to have shaped their manifestos to appeal to the older generation who are statistically less interested in environmental concerns.\nNearby, in a camp outside the Bundestag, a group of climate emergency campaigners calling themselves The Last Generation, entered the 25th day of a hunger strike. They are demanding a public audience with the three main candidates for chancellor ahead of polling day and calling for the establishment of a citizens\u2019 assembly for climate policy.",

        "content": "Grey Gowrie, Lord Gowrie, who has died aged 81, was an exotic and brief-flowering cabinet minister in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s second administration. Few members of her government were published poets and former lecturers in American and English literature and, with dark curly, Byronic hair, saturnine looks, a penchant for floppy bow ties and a fastidious, courtly manner, Gowrie looked the part of a fl\u00e2neur rather than a Thatcherite politician. Even fewer resigned from government, as he did, not for incompetence or even scandal, but because he bluntly claimed he could not live in central London on a ministerial salary.\nAt the time, in 1985, \u00a333,000 a year, which is what he was paid as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in charge of reforming the English civil service, was a comfortable executive salary. Gowrie\u2019s bluntness about its shortcomings provoked ridicule, and overshadowed what had been a competent and engaging ministerial career, including two years as arts minister, for which his background and tastes in literature, poetry and fine art made him better qualified than most holders of that office.\nHis remarks that \u00a31,500 a month was \u201cnot what people need for living in central London\u201d and that in the context he felt he had \u201cdone my bit\u201d were, he later conceded, \u201cextraordinarily stupid\u201d, adding that \u201cit taught me a lesson that in politics it can be ill-advised not to put a gloss upon the truth\u201d.\nHe had been effective as a minister in the six years since Thatcher had led the Conservatives to power in 1979, and had spent a year in cabinet with responsibility for civil service reform, cutting costs and staff before his sudden resignation. Within months he became European chair of Sotheby\u2019s for seven years and latterly chair of Arts Council England and a number of other arts bodies, including the Booker prize panel that gave the award to Roddy Doyle\u2019s novel Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha in 1993.\nAs arts minister Gowrie had deployed steeliness in refusing a rescue grant to the English National Opera, and at the Arts Council he also denied funds to a project for a film about the artist Francis Bacon. He was accused of metropolitan elitism and was said to have fallen out with Virginia Bottomley, one of his ministerial successors, over diverting lottery money to Rada rather than regional theatre. But he was a supporter of Antony Gormley\u2019s Angel of the North statue outside Gateshead and oversaw its inauguration.\nHe was born in Dublin as Alexander Patrick Greysteil Hore-Ruthven \u2013 known as Grey to his acquaintances and Greysteil to his close friends \u2013 and was the son of Patrick Hore-Ruthven, a captain in the Rifle Brigade, and the society beauty Pamela Fletcher. His father was killed during an SAS raid in Libya in 1942, and Grey and his mother spent the war on family estates in Ireland. His grandfather Alexander Hore-Ruthven was another soldier and a Victoria Cross winner, who served as governor general of Australia between 1936 and 1944. The boy was consciously christened after a Scottish ancestor, Patrick Ruthven, one of the assassins who murdered Mary Queen of Scots\u2019 lover David Rizzio in front of her in 1566. Mary\u2019s son, James VI of Scotland, had revoked the family title, Earl of Gowrie, in 1600 and it was restored only in 1945.\nWhen Gowrie\u2019s grandfather returned from Australia at the end of the war and became deputy constable of Windsor Castle, the boy went to live with him, mingling with the royal family. He claimed that this was something of a shock as he had been brought up by an Irish republican nanny to despise the British and their royal family, but he soon fitted in.\nGowrie joked that at Windsor Castle he had simultaneously been taught about art and the facts of life by being shown the Leonardo drawings in the royal art collection. After his mother\u2019s remarriage, to another military figure, Major Derek Cooper, he moved back to Ireland and then was sent to Eton, succeeding to the earldom at the age of 15 on his grandfather\u2019s death in 1955, before going to Balliol College, Oxford. Postgraduate work followed in the rather more demotic surroundings of Buffalo University in upstate New York, then by teaching at Harvard, where he became an assistant to the poet Robert Lowell.\nHe moved back to Britain in 1969 to lecture at University College London, and meanwhile took the Tory whip in the House of Lords. Although socially liberal and a member of the Vietnam protest generation while in the US, he was an economic \u201cdry\u201d and an early convert to what eventually became known as Thatcherite policies.\nIn the Lords under Edward Heath he became a government whip (1972-74) and then, in opposition, a Tory spokesperson on economic affairs (1974-79). On the side, he also became a fine art broker and dealer, selling Picassos and old masters on commission, mainly to wealthy American institutions, including on one occasion a Jackson Pollock, valued at $2m, to the Washington National Gallery.\nAfter Thatcher\u2019s election victory in 1979 he was appointed minister of state in the Department of Employment until 1981 and then \u2013 at his own request \u2013 deputy to the Northern Ireland secretary for two years (1981-83) during the height of the Troubles. Proud of his Irish roots, though he had eventually sold the family estate in County Kildare to the entrepreneur Tony O\u2019Reilly, he served during the IRA hunger strikes, expressing quiet admiration for what he saw as the dying men\u2019s misguided courage.\nAfter the 1983 landslide election result, Thatcher made him minister for the arts. A published but lapsed poet \u2013 his book A Postcard from Don Giovanni had been released in 1972 \u2013 he became an assiduous attender of first nights and exhibitions, and found himself briefly pursued by the tabloids, whose censorious journalists could not believe that such a flamboyant figure did not also dabble in drugs. Gowrie denied it vigorously: \u201cI do think that an arts minister has to spend time in low dives, but I don\u2019t think he actually has to get stoned.\u201d\nBy 1984 he had also been appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in addition to his arts brief, and the following year Thatcher asked him to be education minister. However, he had already made up his mind to resign and turned the offer down, leaving for pastures new in the art world.\nIn 1999, after a prolonged period of declining health, Gowrie\u2019s public life largely came to a halt when it was discovered he needed an urgent heart transplant. He spent five months in Harefield hospital in Middlesex waiting for a suitable donor before the successful operation in 2000. The stay prompted a resumption of poetry writing and he subsequently became chair of the Magdi Yacoub Institute, named after the hospital\u2019s pioneering transplant surgeon who had carried out his operation.\nGowrie is survived by his second wife, Adelheid Gr\u00e4fin von der Schulenburg, a journalist, known as Neiti, whom he married in 1974; by a son, Brer, from his first marriage, to Xandra Bingley, which ended in divorce, and a grandson, Heathcote; and by his brother, the writer Malise Ruthven.\n Alexander Patrick Greysteil Hore-Ruthven, Lord Gowrie, politician, born 26 November 1939; died 24 September 2021",

        "content": "Bizarre spat with his own fans speaks of a manager who thrives on creating tension ahead of high-stakes visit to Chelsea\nNever, ever get comfortable. Watching Pep-era Manchester City cruise through the past five years of beautifully engineered success, backed by perhaps the most supportive, frictionless, economically impregnable environment ever created in English football, it has at times been hard to avoid one key question. Mainly: why all the drama?\nCity travel south to play Chelsea in Saturday\u2019s delicious-looking early kick-off. Aside from the more meaningful pre-match noises off, there has once again been a sense of a peculiar kind of micro-fuss being played out around City\u2019s manager.\nThis time around, the issue \u2013 or rather non-issue, anti-issue \u2013 was a self-igniting mini-spat between Pep Guardiola and City\u2019s own fans. This is all pretty well-rehearsed by now. Ten days ago those same supporters who love Pep, who back the owners, who have embraced almost without question the total transformation of the essence of the club, were accused by their own manager of lacking passion for the project. Well, it\u2019s certainly a bold motivational strategy, Pep. Let\u2019s see if it works.\nAt issue was the failure to fill a midweek stadium in the doldrums of early autumn. \u201cI\u2019d like more people to come on Saturday, we need the people,\u201d Guardiola said after the home game against RB Leipzig, wearing that familiar jazzed-up, happy-not-happy grin, and gesturing around the Etihad stands that had contained just under 40,000.\nNeedles to say, fans hate this kind of talk, a line that feeds into the daily banter-battles over \u201cthe Emptihad\u201d, the idea of City as the arriviste interloper. From your own manager it is both a needless humiliation and a startlingly ignorant take on the reality of following a modern football club at a time when the cost of living is inflamed and people across the country are struggling.\nAs ever there has been a suggestion this is all a media creation, part of the ongoing plot to derail this endlessly lauded and cooed-over champion team. In reality those reporting this faux-beef were as nonplussed as City\u2019s fans, not least by Pep\u2019s own relish for the battle.\nThree days later a near-capacity 52,000-plus were present for the goalless draw with Southampton, but not before Guardiola trailed the idea of his own huffy departure (\u201cWhen people are not happy with me, I will leave\u201d). It remains the weirdest of escalations: a backlash over a non-backlash to a non-issue, a man picking a fight with his own shadow.\nAnd perhaps there is a clue in this. The Chelsea game comes on the back of a mild start to the season for the champions. City had 64% possession against Southampton but only one shot on target. They were smooth but a little underpowered in a 1-0 win against Leicester. But Stamford Bridge is the bookend to a vertiginous week, with a trip to Paris on Tuesday followed by another to Liverpool five days later.\nTime, then, to get into character, to get that game face on. There is a sense here of fuel being put on the fire, a manager who just needs to feel what he is doing is in some sense vital, pure and fretted with high-stakes tension, even if this involves feeding off a little man-made stress. There is something of a pattern here, a football club where mini-disasters keep on not happening, where dramas continue to non-erupt, where the manager keeps on not-leaving.\nA year ago City were on their way to one of the great illusory on-field crises, product of a tactical tinkering that brought 18 goals in their first 12 league games, but which gave way in December to that sublime title-sealing run of 21 straight wins. The previous autumn brought injuries, midfielders in defence, contortions on the Anfield touchline, followed by the threat of a two-year ban from Europe. At the end of which City finished second, won a cup, scored a lot of goals, and basically kept rolling on, lawyered-up and ready to spend in the summer.\nIt is a recurrent dynamic these past five years: hints of mini-crisis, culture-clash, Pep-exit; accompanied, in the wider view, by serene progress, positive reinforcement, happy players and all the rest.\nAt the centre of this there is the basic paradox of Guardiola and City. Watching the most intense man in football thrashing about in this utterly supportive environment, at a club where even minor failure, second place on the big stage, really isn\u2019t much of a drama, has been like watching the troubled antihero in piece of absurdist fiction. Here is a manager who is obsessed with football, with the purity of competition, installed at what is essentially a project club, a machine designed to promote the interests of its owners with no expense spared. Absurdist antiheroes are condemned to seek meaning in a world of soft edges. Absurdist antiheroes flail about and beat their fists at the sky. Absurdist antiheroes often wear black roll-neck jumpers.\nThere is something of this desire to create tension even in the nuts and bolts of teams and tactics. Those recurrent twitches in high-stakes games feel like a symptom of this same kind of pride, the desire to not just win but to win with meaning. It is at least one way of explaining the last time City met Chelsea, Porto in June, when Guardiola sent out a team with an entire position, the defensive midfielder, erased \u2013 an attempt at some kind of victory for the ages, an attacking midfield masterpiece to end attacking midfield masterpieces.\nIt is tempting to conclude this yearning for the grand notes, for ultimacy, reflects his own founding experiences. Barcelona will do this to you: the idea of football as identity, as Catalan nationalism, as the search for Cruyffian tactical perfection.\nFootball has been everything to Guardiola, who left his parents aged 13 to attend La Masia, who played and managed at a club where support is an act of supplication. If he finds it odd City don\u2019t block out their stadium three times a week then he is perhaps not comparing like things. Guardiola doesn\u2019t really do wry self-awareness, or not being really there.\nSo on to Stamford Bridge, and the first really meaningful engagement of City\u2019s season. Both teams have only one real change from the summer. For Chelsea this is a missing piece in Romelu Lukaku, for City a strengthening of what is already there in Jack Grealish.\nThere will be a temptation to see the effects of City\u2019s failure to sign a centre-forward. Guardiola will be more concerned with what Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea already had: the ability to make an opponent play badly, to interrupt patterns, to defend without conceding an advantage to the attacker.\nIt was this quality that drove those three Chelsea victories over City from April into May, games that offered a kind of tactical dance, a call and response of shifting shapes and formations. City will be bolstered by the return of Phil Foden and 90 minutes for Kevin De Bruyne in midweek. We should expect a game of fine details and, of course, drama.",

        "content": "Analysis: After the Huawei chief\u2019s detention, the saga rapidly turned from a narrow legal dispute into an escalating battle\nThe deal allowing Meng Wanzhou to return home to China nearly three years after her arrest will come as a relief to all the participants in a saga that rapidly turned from a narrow legal dispute into an escalating geopolitical battle.\nAfter the Huawei finance chief was detained on a US warrant in Vancouver airport in December 2018, Canada, China and the US soon found themselves locked into a court case which they were all \u2013 at least in political terms \u2013 doomed to lose.\nMeng\u2019s case was never going to turn purely on the idiosyncrasies of Canadian extradition law or the frankness with which she had told Huawei\u2019s bankers HSBC about the relationship between her company and a subsidiary accused of violating US sanctions against Iran.\nFor one thing, even though the justice department may have felt they were doggedly acting on information about a potential breach of US sanctions law, Donald Trump made the case explicitly political by saying he would intervene to drop the charges if he thought it would help US-China trade negotiations.\nChina, meanwhile, felt Meng and Huawei were being used as a weapon in a wider battle. It was highly unusual for the prosecution to be directed at the chief finance officer personally and not at the corporation. Last year, Airbus agreed to pay $4bn in penalties to resolve a bribery case. In 2015, Deutsche Bank was fined $258m for violating Iran- and Syria-related sanctions. But no executives were detained in either case.\nSince Meng was the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, this was viewed as a personal attack not just on the firm but on a business hero.\nBeijing responded to her detention on three tracks.\nWithin days, the Chinese government detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, on dubious charges. A Chinese court in August found Spavor guilty of espionage and sentenced him to 11 years in prison. He has appealed the ruling. The verdict for Kovrig has yet to be announced.\nSecond, Huawei prepared one of the most legally sophisticated, multi pronged and expensive court challenges to an extradition ever mounted \u2013 one that would likely have taken years to wind its way through the Canadian courts. After two years of hearings, the court was due to announce in October when it would rule on Meng\u2019s extradition. The substantive hearing in the US \u2013 now cancelled \u2013 would have been equally drawn out.\nFinally, the Chinese government made life as difficult as possible for Canada.\nCaught between two superpowers and desperately aware of the need to display the independence of its courts, Canada has tried to avoid provocation. It still has not announced its decision on Huawei 5G or the on listing of China CGTN television network . Nor has it been at the forefront of those defending Taiwan from Chinese threats. It was not a member of the Aukus security pact announced this week. The emphasis has been on quiet diplomacy, and making clear through its declaration on arbitrary detention that state hostage taking is unacceptable \u2013 although even that prompted a furious reaction from Beijing.\nSo why has a settlement been reached now? The US justice department said the out-of-court settlement is not dissimilar to one discussed between the two sides last year. At the time Meng refused to make any admission of guilt at all. Since then she may have realised her chances of avoiding extradition were vanishingly small. The court\u2019s room for discretion in extradition cases is low. The judge cannot hold a substantive trial of the charges just to test if the alleged crime would be considered illegal in Canada, and whether there had been abuse of process.\nMeng may find this frustrating, given the evidence shown in court.\nHer lawyers argued that internal HSBC emails and memos showed she had been upfront with senior HSBC staff about Huawei\u2019s relationship with the subsidiary accused of sanctions-busting, Skycom.\nIndeed, at a hearing in August, the judge in the case said that the case against Meng seemed very unusual. No one lost money, the allegations were several years old, and the intended victim, a global bank, knew the truth even as it was allegedly being lied to.\nHeather Holmes, associate chief justice, asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t it unusual that one will see a fraud case with no actual harm many years later? And one in which the alleged victim, a large institution, appears to have had numerous people within the institution who had all the facts that are now said to be misrepresented?\u201d\nIn reaching the out of court settlement the US may have acknowledged its case at trial was hardly watertight.\nBut the deal struck on Friday contains damning admissions by Meng that she had been knowingly untruthful in telling HSBC about the links between Huawei and its subsidiary operating in Iran. The DPA does not set out whether HSBC independently knew anyway about the degree of connection, merely that facts in the presentation were inaccurate.\nHer return to China will come as a welcome gift to the re-elected Justin Trudeau \u2013 even if he still has to negotiate the release of the two Michaels.",

        "content": "Fawn fire scorches more than 8.5 sq miles amid hot, dry and gusty conditions as smoke from forest raises air quality concerns\nA fresh wildfire in northern California spread rapidly on Thursday, burning homes and prompting evacuation orders in a rural community in Shasta county.\nMeanwhile, two big forest blazes in the heart of California\u2019s giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada continued to grow. Smoke from those fires raised air quality concerns for the southern end of the Central Valley and flowed over greater Los Angeles, darkening skies and causing mistaken reports of mountain fires.\nThe Fawn fire in northern California started Wednesday north of Redding in Shasta county, and scorched more than 8.5 sq miles (22 sq km) of heavy timber on steep, rugged terrain amid hot, dry and gusty conditions.\nKRCR-TV aired video of multiple houses burning near the unincorporated Mountain Gate area, and officials said 25 structures were destroyed. It wasn\u2019t clear how many of them were homes.\nA woman was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of starting the fire.\nThis area of northern California has endured numerous major fires in recent years. As firefighters in Shasta county battled the Fawn fire, the district attorney on Friday announced manslaughter charges against Pacific Gas and Electric for its role in last year\u2019s Zogg fire, which killed four people and burned nearly 90 sq miles.\n\u201cIn this case, they failed to perform their legal duties,\u201d said Stephanie Bridgett, the district attorney. \u201cTheir failure was reckless, and it was criminally negligent, and it resulted in the deaths of four people.\u201d\nThe utility, already a convicted felon for sparking the 2018 Camp fire and a 2010 gas pipeline explosion, has sparked hundreds of blazes in California in recent years.\nIn the Sequoia national park, officials showed reporters how the park\u2019s famous Giant Forest has been protected from the KNP Complex fire by years of using carefully set and controlled fires to burn away vegetation that can serve as wildfire fuel.\nThe bases of some of the most famous giant sequoias were also wrapped in fire-resistant materials. Giant Forest has 2,000 sequoias and includes the General Sherman Tree, the largest tree in the world by volume.\nThe fear of catastrophic fire coming through that section of the national park has been greatly reduced because of the combination of the prescribed burns and the low intensity of the fire that moved into part of the forest, said Ed Christopher, deputy fire director for the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\u201cAnd because of that, we feel that the majority of the trees in this Giant Forest area should come out of this event like they have for the past thousands of years,\u201d he said.\nAcross California, more than 9,000 firefighters remained assigned to 10 large, active wildfires, according to the state\u2019s department of forestry and fire protection. \n California fires have burned 3,671 sq miles this year, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.\nHistoric drought tied to the climate crisis is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say the climate crisis has made the west much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.\nThe KNP Complex began as two fires ignited by lighting on 9 September. The fires later merged into one and have charred more than 56 sq miles. Sequoia and adjacent Kings Canyon national park have been closed. Several communities are under evacuation orders or warnings to be prepared to leave. There was no containment.\nNearby, the Windy fire has burned through nearly 77 sq miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia national forest, including Giant Sequoia national monument. It was just 6% contained.",

Most of her family and friends are across the border in Queensland.\n\u201cI understand why the border is closed, but there\u2019s no clear message about [when we might be able to re-enter Queensland],\u201d she says. \u201cAny message we get is so vague. They basically expect you to deal with the fact this is going to happen for a long period.\n\u201cI\u2019m fully vaccinated and I\u2019m following the rules. What I\u2019m most upset about is that last year when we were all first locked down, we had this sort of solidarity as a country.\n\u201cThis year it feels like if you\u2019re stuck in this situation, the attitude is it\u2019s too bad.\u201d\nThe latest angst about the Queensland-New South Wales border has stemmed partly from a national focus on Victoria and NSW, where Covid case numbers remain high. Pathways to removing lockdown restrictions in those states are linked to vaccination rates.\nQueensland has its own roadmap, but the plan does not mention vaccination rates or when the borders might open.\nPalaszczuk said this week people should \u201ctake a deep breath\u201d and wait until next Friday \u2013 the next national cabinet meeting \u2013 before she could given any more detail about when the roadblocks would be removed.\nAsked if interstate travel could be allowed by Christmas, Palaszczuk said: \u201cGo and ask New South Wales and Victoria.\u201d\n\u201cThe reason we have tough border measures in place is because there is a massive outbreak at the moment in New South Wales and Victoria and their hospitals are going to be overwhelmed,\u201d Palaszczuk said.\n\u201cI think everyone needs to take a really deep breath here, because what we are trying to do is protect this state and keep Queenslanders healthy and out of hospitals.\u201d\nShe also dismissed the idea of allowing international travel.\n\u201cWhere are you going to go? Are you going to go to India?\u201d\n\u201cI think the federal government needs to identify very clearly what are the countries that Australians can travel to, OK?\u201d\nQueensland\u2019s success at beating back Covid outbreaks and the relative freedoms in the state have emboldened a hardline and broadly popular border policy.\nEven as media pressure amplifies \u2013 the Courier-Mail\u2019s front page on Friday called Palaszczuk the Christmas \u201cGrinch\u201d \u2013 the premier and her conservative chief health officer, Jeanette Young, have remained steadfast.\nIn the process, genuine concerns about the state\u2019s management of the border \u2013 including a lack of communication, planning, compassion and common sense \u2013 have become swept into an increasingly polarised debate.\nThose directly affected by border closures say they have grown increasingly frustrated.\nMelbourne woman Emma Bisshop\u2019s mother is in an aged care facility in Cairns. She had hoped to travel north for Christmas.\n\u201cWe are acutely aware that time with Mum is precious,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually been very thankful that she\u2019s been protected from Covid. I\u2019ve been happy that Queensland shut the borders. We\u2019ve got our vaccinations so we can visit her, but the hardest part is not knowing when \u2013 or if \u2013 that can even happen.\u201d\nHilary Jacobs, the president of the Greater Southern Gold Coast chamber of commerce, says it is \u201cevident that people are getting tired\u201d of the border closure.\n\u201cThe Queensland population has been a migratory population,\u201d she says. \u201cMany Queenslanders started life in the southern states or only retired to Queensland, and as a result of that, many of those people haven\u2019t been able to see their extended family, their children [or] grandchildren. They\u2019re missing the vital growing up years of their family.\n\u201cThe biggest problem for business at the moment in Queensland is that we have no idea from one day to the next where we\u2019re heading.\n\u201cWhat we do need to understand are what will be the triggers for the border bubble being fully reinstated, or the bubble not being required at all? When we can take bookings from interstate travellers safely, and when we can have confidence?\u201d",

There are reports of drug use and dealing among church ministers, civil servants, politicians, traditional leaders and even police.\nMore than 60% of admissions to Tonga\u2019s mental health wards are linked to illicit drugs.\nSocial services and Tonga\u2019s prison system have become overwhelmed. Last year, Ned Cook, the country\u2019s only trained drug counsellor was killed. A man was convicted of manslaughter for his death.\nTonga\u2019s commissioner of prisons, Semisi Tapueluelu, said Tonga needed two more prisons and many more psychiatric beds to adequately respond to the surge in drug offences and psychologically disturbed prisoners, according to a report from RNZ.\nTonga is a constitutional monarchy and its royal family usually play a ceremonial role. It is rare for members of the royal family to make political comments and address parliament so directly, showing the strength of the king\u2019s feeling on the topic.\nLevin-Tevi said the king\u2019s interventions have been welcomed by most Tongans, including her organisation.\nMember of parliament, Lord Fusitu\u2019a, who is Tonga\u2019s Niuas nobles\u2019 representative, said the king is widely supported, including by parliamentarians.\n\u201cHis speech is a guiding light. He\u2019s the only apolitical body in the constitution so his assessment of a government of the day is always taken into account,\u201d he said.\nIt is not the first time King Tupou VI has chastised parliament for its handling of the nation\u2019s drug crisis. In May, in a televised speech that shocked the nation, the king questioned the honesty of the members of parliament and their ability to run the government, in relation to their handling of the drugs crisis.\n\u201cAll of Tonga was saying good luck to the parliamentarians now that the king is speaking up,\u201d said Levin-Tevi. \u201cIt\u2019s a speech everyone will remember for a long time. It really woke parliament up.\u201d\n\u201cThe drug issue is harming our people on a daily basis. We\u2019d been knocking on parliament doors, but they never got back to us. After the king\u2019s first speech, there was much more attention. They increased the budget for the police and drugs unit and started to listen to small groups that are involved in this field,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the recent speech, he said it\u2019s not enough and warned not to decrease the attention just because they had increased the funds and that the momentum needed to be upheld.\u201d\nLord Fusitu\u2019a said the government increased the budget for the police department from TOP5m (AU$3m) to TOP50m (AU$30m) specifically in response to his majesty\u2019s concerns.\nThe Tongan parliament even recently considered making serious drug offences punishable by death, but a majority of MPs voted against the bill, voting in favour of life in prison instead.\nLord Fusitu\u2019a said the bill, which would\u2019ve made it a mandatory death penalty for anyone found trafficking 5kg of a class A drug, was not the answer.\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s a problem that needs to be addressed but class A is a very broad class, it includes things like codeine and Valium, so if that were law, and you had five kilos of painkillers because you\u2019ve got a bad back, you\u2019d get executed, so obviously that\u2019s not a solution,\u201d he said.\nKing Tupou VI will open a two-day National Symposium on Illicit Drugs, a first for Tonga, on 6 October, with theme of \u201cworking together for a drug-free Tonga\u201d.",

        "content": "The anti-lockdown movement \u2018opportunistically\u2019 latched onto the frustrations of construction workers, experts say\nWhen self-described citizen journalist Rukshan Fernando arrived outside the office of the Victorian Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union on Monday morning and began filming, he asked the handful of men milling around outside in hi-vis jackets what they were doing there.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for our rights, OK? First of all, everybody has a free choice. We don\u2019t want to have to lose our jobs,\u201d one of them told him.\nAnother said: \u201cThe message needs to go to [Victorian premier] Dan Andrews bro, fuck the vaccine off, we ain\u2019t getting it.\u201d\nIn just a few hours the gathering would transform into an angry mob. By the middle of the afternoon, hundreds of people \u2013 many in those same hi-vis jackets \u2013 had shown up at the CFMEU headquarters to confront the union\u2019s powerful secretary, John Setka, over a grab bag of grievances centred on new rules that make Covid vaccinations mandatory for construction workers in Victoria.\nAmong many construction workers, anger at Covid-era rule changes had been growing for months. As the Age reported this week, much of that frustration had been directed at the union itself, due to a perception that its leadership had not opposed the mandate.\nBut Monday\u2019s protest \u2013 and the week-long series of sometimes violent demonstrations that followed \u2013 sparked a parallel debate about the legitimacy of the uprising and the involvement of far-right actors and conspiracy groups in its organisation.\nSetka said many of the attendees were \u201cneo-Nazis and rightwing extremists\u201d rather than union members. Former federal Labor leader Bill Shorten claimed rightwing groups made up of \u201cman-baby Nazis\u201d had dialled a \u201crent a crowd\u201d.\nBut there is little evidence Monday\u2019s initial protest was fuelled by far-right agitators. Among the dozen or so men who gathered outside the CFMEU on Monday was Luke Young, a construction worker who describes himself as \u201cunion through and through\u201d and has no association with any of the groups who later flocked to the protests.\nYoung told Guardian Australia this week he and a handful of colleagues had decided to walk to the CFMEU offices on Monday out of frustration both at the vaccine mandate but also a proposal pushed by the union that would remove rest breaks for workers in exchange for them being paid eight hours for six hours\u2019 work.\n\u201cThe main reason it all started was people wanted to talk to the union and just get clarification on all this stuff because we feel like it goes against our EBA [enterprise bargaining agreement] and everything we\u2019ve fought for,\u201d Young said.\n\u201cThere were only five of us that went down. I had spoken to delos [union delegates] on site and they had no clarity or any updates on what the union was doing either. You can\u2019t ring them up because people were getting hung up on if they mentioned anything to do with the vaccine.\n\u201cSo the only way was to go there and talk to them in person and we decided to do that but we didn\u2019t expect anything like that to happen.\u201d Young told the Guardian he left the protest after Setka attempted to speak to the rally on Monday, and hasn\u2019t been to any of the protests that followed.\nWhether Monday\u2019s protest began entirely organically, as Young believes, is unclear. But the presence of Fernando \u2013 a wedding photographer who has built a niche as a live-streamer of anti-lockdown protests and denies claims the protests were driven by the far right \u2013 suggests there was some pre-planning. He told the Guardian he was alerted to the protest by an Instagram post, though he could not recall who posted it.\nIn any case, while Monday may have started out as a legitimate expression of frustration, it quickly attracted the attention of the so-called freedom groups that have made a name for themselves protesting against Covid-era restrictions and generally pushing a mass of conspiracy material throughout the pandemic.\nBy the afternoon, members of one of the largest anti-lockdown groups in Melbourne were encouraging others to attend the rally, and by Tuesday, the same group, led by serial protest organiser Harrison McLean \u2013 whose engagement with a number of far-right groups online has previously been revealed by the Guardian \u2013 was pushing its own \u201cWorkers Rally for Freedom\u201d.\nMcLean has previously denied being involved in the far right. \u201cI am not Far-Right. I am a Libertarian Populist, and I support Freedom of Speech,\u201d McLean posted under an online username, Dominic, in one forum.\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the long, aimless protests that meandered around Melbourne were littered with figures linked to both the far right and the more conspiracy-driven freedom movement.\nThe answer to the question of whether the protests were an expression of frustration by a group of legitimate blue-collar workers or a conspiracy-driven swamp of anti-lockdown campaigners, libertarians and neo-Nazis is: both.\n\u201cEveryone is asking this question of whether they were Nazis or not,\u201d Dr Kaz Ross, an expert in the far-right and conspiracy-theorist movements in Australia, told the Guardian this week.\n\u201cYes, there were identified and known Nazis among the crowds but, you know, Nazis have jobs too and some of them work in construction.\u201d\nRoss told the Guardian she believed the use of the construction workers by the anti-lockdown movement was \u201copportunistic\u201d \u2013 but also a tactic it had frequently used.\n\u201cThe anti-lockdown types have been looking around trying to latch on to some kind of legitimate-looking group to associate themselves with,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tried it with the truckies and they\u2019re trying it with nurses and teachers and aged care workers.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some evidence the tactic is working. While promises that the protests would continue \u201cevery day\u201d had fizzled out by Thursday (another protest planned for Friday also appeared to fail) many were critical of heavy-handed tactics used by the Victoria police to quell the demonstrations.\n\u201cAnyone who thinks that it\u2019s a good thing having special operations police looking like they\u2019ve just stepped out of a war zone in Afghanistan walking around Melbourne is nuts,\u201d Ross said.\nThe protests also gained the explicit and implicit support of some establishment MPs. On Monday, Bernie Finn, the Victorian state Liberal MP who has opposed lockdown measures, expressed support for the anti-vaccine mandate sentiments of some protesters, writing on Facebook: \u201cThere is no justification for violence but if any government tried to force medical treatment on me against my will, they\u2019d see a fighting fury.\u201d\nOther political groups were more explicit in their support. Members of the fringe libertarian party, the Liberal Democrats, for example, have attended anti-lockdown protests throughout the pandemic, and during the week, figures from the party were highly critical of the police response while also re-tweeting far-right figures such as Avi Yemini.\nWhether the protests have broader public support is questionable. After Wednesday\u2019s protest culminated in an extended standoff between demonstrators and police at the Shrine of Remembrance, the Victorian RSL released a statement condemning the protesters for \u201ccompletely disrespecting the sanctity of this space\u201d. Later, the shrine\u2019s chief executive, Dean Lee, told breakfast TV that protesters had urinated on the memorial.\n\u201cThere was broken glass, there was rubbish, there was even urination on parts of this sacred monument, which is absolutely appalling,\u201d Lee said.",

        "content": "Drive to Survive has become a viral hit, with lockdowns and demand for content driving the new trend in sport\nIn modern sport, content is king. Whatever the discipline, the actual sporting action has become increasingly sidelined. Instead, it is the drama, the narrative, the bite-sized highlights, the player transfers \u2013 what was once surrounding noise has become the main event. Social media and money have created an ecosystem where likes and clicks are more important than results.\nFootball has been at the forefront of this trend. In a recent column, a perceptive observer highlighted \u201cthe odd existence of the digital football supporter who doesn\u2019t care about football.\u201d Retweeting the piece, a British journalist critiqued the \u201cphenomenon of actual football being just an audition for the real business of transfers\u201d. In recent weeks, Manchester United\u2019s social media accounts have been an apt example: content about the return of Cristiano Ronaldo has flooded the club\u2019s accounts, with such frequency that actual matches were overshadowed.\nBut football is not the only sport to walk this path. American sporting executives in the NFL, NBA and MLB executives are fretting over how to attract and retain the next generation of supporters, with recent research showing that younger fans prefer to watch highlights over full matches. The study\u2019s author described the \u201cTikTok-ification\u201d of sport, with fans \u201cwanting smaller bits, shorter segments, highlights.\u201d An insightful case study on the possibilities and pitfalls of elite sport in the content era can be found in F1.\nWhen Drive to Survive, a 10-part docuseries chronicling the mixed fortunes of several teams across the preceding F1 season, was released on Netflix in 2019 it was met with relative acclaim. At least it was sufficiently successful to persuade big-hitting teams Ferrari and Mercedes to join for season two, after they had initially denied Netflix access. But with seasons two and three dropping early and mid-pandemic, the series has become a viral hit \u2013 joining the likes of Tiger King and The Queen\u2019s Gambit as lockdown binge favourites.\nDrive to Survive is exhilarating \u2013 a mix of personal backstories, inter- and intra-team feuds and 300km per hour racing. Australia\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo has a starring role, with his Australian humour and broad grin winning viewers\u2019 affections as he battles teammate Max Verstappen at Red Bull in season one, before jumping ship for Renault.\nThe most recent season is particularly gripping, charting the impact of the pandemic on motorsports (complete with the debacle of the cancelled Australian Grand Prix last March). The penultimate episode, \u201cMan on Fire\u201d, provides an emotional reliving of Romain Grosjean\u2019s death-defying accident at the Bahrain Grand Prix last November. The scene where Grosjean pulls himself out of a burning inferno and clambers over a race wall is remarkable, agonising television.\nBut the shortcoming in content like Drive to Survive, produced in partnership with F1, is the lack of a critical lens. This is not a novel concern \u2013 in Australia, the rise of news-gathering units within the AFL and the NRL have led to accusations of bias \u2013 but it feels particularly acute in the F1 context. The sport faces two major threats to its viability, yet neither gets even a single mention across Drive to Survive\u2019s three series.\nThe first and perhaps most existential challenge is climate change. In 2018, the F1 estimated that its annual carbon dioxide emissions were about a quarter of a million tonnes, the same as the yearly electricity consumption of almost 200,000 households. The actual racing produces just a fraction of this, with F1 cars using hybrid engines. Instead, it is the sport\u2019s globe-trotting \u2013 and accompanying weighty freight \u2013 that leaves such a heavy carbon footprint. While F1 says it will be net zero by 2030, that aspiration remains a pipe dream \u2013 and perplexingly absent from the glossy docuseries.\nThe second frequent criticism of modern F1 is its complicity in sportswashing. The 2021 season takes drivers from Bahrain on the opening day to Saudi Arabia in the penultimate race later this year, with pit-stops along the way in Azerbaijan and Russia. All are ranked \u2018not-free\u2019 by Freedom House in its global rankings. Azerbaijan was accused last year of committing war crimes in a conflict with neighbouring Armenia; the Saudi regime has critic Jamal Khashoggi dismembered with a bone saw at its Turkish consulate in 2018.\nAll four nations have spent big on sport to burnish their global reputations \u2013 and F1 is more than happy to take the cash. At one point in the show, Ricciardo is interviewed about his love of the city-centre course in Baku, Azerbaijan. He neglects to mention its human rights record.\nDespite the rose-tinted coverage in what is effectively an advertorial for F1, Drive to Survive has been an unqualified success. Netflix is notoriously cagey about viewing numbers, but the show has been a commercial hit \u2013 in March this year, it was the seventh most-watched show on the platform. Netflix has even hinted recently that it might consider acquiring broadcast rights to the racing itself. The PGA Golf Tour, meanwhile, is hoping for its own version. If avoiding sensitive subjects and not asking hard questions is the price to pay for unprecedented fly on the wall access, it seems viewers and Netflix consider that a fair bargain.\nWhile some diehard F1 followers have criticised the show for distorting incidents and using fake race noise, it has captivated the wider audience. Most importantly, from an F1 perspective, it has converted viewers into fans \u2013 especially in non-traditional markets. In the United States, race viewing figures are up 50%. A Vox columnist recently declared that the show had changed her life and made her an F1 addict.\nIt has worked on me, too. Despite being well-aware of the sport\u2019s ugly underbelly, Drive to Survive has propelled me into fandom. When I woke to the news earlier this month that Ricciardo had won his first race in three years, I was jubilant. Dissecting the race and reading competing analysis of the latest incident between F1 heavyweights Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, I was already awaiting the Netflix recount in the forthcoming fourth season.\nThis weekend, for the first time I will be watching the live broadcast of a Grand Prix \u2013 in Sochi, Russia. I will not be the only one to have switched from the Netflix entr\u00e9e to the F1 main course. That, I suppose, is the hope for sports in 2021: that content, highlights, clicks and likes are not a substitute for the real thing, but a gateway.",

Monty Kanungo says although he is a Port Adelaide \u201ctragic\u201d (the Bulldogs thrashed Port Adelaide in the preliminary final), he couldn\u2019t miss the chance to go to a grand final in Perth for the first time.\n\u201cPeople are treating it like a rock concert or a music festival they\u2019ll never see again,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people are messaging me from Adelaide, saying can you even be excited when we lost so badly?\n\u201cI\u2019m hurting, but if I wasn\u2019t here I\u2019d be hurting even more. It\u2019s cauterised the pain.\u201d\nAs to who he will support, Kanungo says he is split.\n\u201cMy heart\u2019s with the Dees, but my head\u2019s with the Dogs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been that long [for Melbourne]. They deserve a win, their supporters deserve a win.\u201d\nGetting a seat has not been easy leading up to the big day. Although it has a 60,000-person capacity, only 12,000 tickets were released to the public with the rest held in reserve.\nAs a result, some have gone all out to get a ticket.\nDylan Hughes says he spent a whole week trying to find tickets.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a West Coast Eagles supporter, but on social media I was whatever supporter I needed to be to get me a ticket,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cThanks to the guy who gave me his number, I\u2019ll be supporting the Dees tomorrow.\u201d\nThough he did make an effort to get hold of the team colours to show his support, Hughes says that ended up proving impossible.\nInstead he picked up a shirt from local social media personality Josh Garlepp who campaigned for the 2021 grand final to be held in Perth in a social media video with the tagline: \u201cPerth, we\u2019re still here and slightly better than Adelaide.\u201d\n\u201cMy sister was in Brisbane, she got to the grand final last year,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cSo I was super jealous, and I was super stoked to have it here.

        "content": "Recent history suggests Liberals and Nationals have little to fear from Craig Kelly and One Nation, but the dynamics of the next vote are unclear\nOne of the federal government\u2019s Queensland MPs was enjoying some downtime at home recently, watching the reality show SAS Australia. They were interrupted by a sudden jolt \u2013 not an abseiling mishap or some other epic fail by a hapless contestant \u2013 but the sudden appearance during an ad break of their former colleague Craig Kelly.\nYou may remember him as the Liberal backbencher with brimming feelings and wild theories on pretty much everything. Kelly parted ways with the government back in February. These days, he\u2019s the federal leader of the United Australia party, fronting ads for Clive Palmer\u2019s political operation.\nGiven their startled state, my informant couldn\u2019t remember precisely what the ad said. But the message was against lockdowns.\nWhen I spoke to Kelly this week to try to work out which ad was now running during prime time on free-to-air television, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure either, although he guessed it was the \u201crubber bullets on the streets one\u201d. The script for that reads: \u201cPolice on the streets with rubber bullets in Melbourne. The army on the streets in Sydney. Is this the Australia that we want? Fight back and help protect our rights and our freedom with United Australia party.\u201d\nAs agitprop goes, this is all pretty nimble. The UAP evidently moves quickly enough to loop an ugly conflagration on the streets of Melbourne back into political messaging, lickety-split. The party\u2019s advertising operation also responded to events rapidly during the last federal election campaign.\nA number of Coalition MPs expect that Scott Morrison will call the election after the Christmas break, yet the UAP evidently has the resources to engage in prime time advertising now.\nIt\u2019s not just television. The UAP\u2019s rubber bullets sponsored post started running on Facebook on Thursday, with a spend to date of between $3,000 to $3,500. This campaign is a recruitment drive: like our videos, like our page, and join the party \u201ctoday\u201d. Professionals who monitor the digital spend by political parties and candidates tell me the UAP spent around half a million dollars on platforms like YouTube between 27 August and 22 September.\nThis pre-emptive cash splash should not surprise. According to an analysis of Palmer\u2019s media buy that Labor commissioned after the last federal election, the mining magnate outspent McDonald\u2019s, Toyota and Coles spruiking the UAP in the year leading up to the federal election. He then spent more than $8m on saturation advertising in the final week of the contest.\nWhen I asked Kelly this week what sort of resources the UAP would have for 2022, he laughed and asked \u201chave you seen the film Dances with Wolves?\u201d Given I saw the film back in 1990, I asked for a prompt. He said there was a memorable scene when one of the main Sioux characters asked the Kevin Costner character how many white men would ultimately come to the prairie. The crestfallen Costner character breaks the terrible news: \u201cAs many as the stars in the sky.\u201d\nKelly contends spruiking on an industrial scale is entirely reasonable because the UAP is seeking to be on a \u201clevel playing field\u201d with other established political parties that can draw on taxpayer-funded resources to field their campaigns \u2013 professional staff, phones, printing allowances and the like. \u201cThere\u2019s another round of community grants coming up, which is another way for members of parliament to get money out the door,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cAll that is taxpayer money.\u201d\nThe UAP are not the only insurgents limbering up for the main event. While there has been some speculation that Pauline Hanson may be considering her future, One Nation looks like it\u2019s had a dose of the smelling salts now that a noisy minority backlash against pandemic public health restrictions and the mandating of vaccines in some sectors seems to be gathering pace. In Queensland, the former premier Campbell Newman is also running for the Liberal Democrats in the Senate.\nThese protagonists are orienteering along pandemic fault lines. The opening year of Covid-19 brought Australians closer together, and numerous polls registered a rebound in trust in institutions, including governments. But the second year of the crisis has been more rancorous.\nDelta, and the protracted lockdowns to try to contain the outbreak while vaccination rates rise, coupled with the Morrison government\u2019s bungling of the rollout, has eroded the sense of Australian exceptionalism that was palpable back when massive fiscal support and effective suppression allowed large swathes of the country to maintain normal-adjacent activity.\nMost Australians locked down in the south-east are trudging on stoically without the need for performative resistance, like storming Melbourne\u2019s Shrine of Remembrance. But with the pandemic shifting from a bonding experience to an endurance race, and with a small conga line of political actors marshalling to exploit disaffection by framing public health measures as an egregious violation of liberty, the Coalition is obviously worried about its restive right flank.\nThis fear explains all the validating of the protesters that happened this week \u2013 at least before the mob started using the shrine as an ad-hoc port-a-loo. Before that, there was lots of opportunistic \u201cour brave boys\u201d, \u201csons of freedom\u201d, \u201cstick it to the man\u201d (as long as the man is Daniel Andrews) going on.\nQueensland frontbencher Amanda Stoker was still validating the \u201cdeep frustration\u201d of protesting Victorians after the shocker at the shrine. It got so out of hand that Josh Frydenberg had to front Andrew Bolt and say in very clear terms that thuggery in his home town was a disgrace. (Bolt wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a disgrace or not. Frydenberg thought they could \u201cdisagree on that one\u201d).\nThere\u2019s an obvious question to ask. Are Liberals and Nationals worried about the competition on their right flank for good reason?\nRecent history would say no.\nDuring the 2019 election, all the noise on the right was ultimately beneficial to Morrison. The surround-sound UAP messaging amplified the risks of a Shorten Labor government, with its nonexistent \u201cdeath tax\u201d. In Queensland, disaffected Labor supporters parked their protest votes with One Nation and the preferences flowed back to the Coalition overwhelmingly.\nBut it\u2019s not clear yet whether the same dynamic will apply in the coming federal contest. Thus far, the UAP messaging is very much a pox on all your houses. One of Kelly\u2019s YouTube \u201cstop the lockdown\u201d ads has the former Liberal declaring \u201cwe can never trust Liberal or Labor again\u201d.\nBut who knows how this wave ultimately breaks.\nEven if it breaks badly for Morrison, I suspect the noise doesn\u2019t assist Labor. To win the next federal election, the opposition has to be able to mount a \u201cchange\u201d case that is simple enough and loud enough for voters to hear.\nAnthony Albanese has to be able to convince voters tired of Morrison\u2019s missteps that their protest votes should come to Labor, not alternatives. Success requires reaching disengaged cohorts of voters that are increasingly hard to reach. If the cacophony on the right generates an impenetrable wall of sound, that\u2019s not helpful.\nOne of the sharpest political operatives I know thinks the coming contest will be a seat-by-seat slugfest rather than an election with a clear national focal point.\nThis person believes there is actually fertile ground for a grand narrative election because obscured behind the often superficial daily contention of pandemic politics is a lived reality where societal and economic inequality has been supercharged by the public health crisis. The daily contention has also left a lot of Australians wondering whether their federation still works. People want to know what comes next, and voters are craving empathic leadership.\nSo there\u2019s a certainly contest there to be had.\nThe question is, will psychologically fatigued voters have the bandwidth to process it?",

        "content": "Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has said he has ignored the guidance on heading restrictions in training, with Tottenham\u2019s manager suggesting that aerial challenges are impossible to scale down.\nThe Football Association and the English game\u2019s other major bodies announced in July that players ought to be limited to 10 \u201chigher force\u201d headers a week in training amid continued investigations into the health risks associated with regularly heading a ball, which could include dementia. How the recommendation might be enforced was questioned at the time.\nNuno, who is preparing for Sunday\u2019s derby at Arsenal, has bemoaned his team\u2019s difficulties with defending set pieces and it is clear that he is not about to stand them down from heading as he attempts to find the solutions.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have training sessions without nobody seeing us,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned with the situation of dementia and what heading the ball can cause. It\u2019s a big concern for us but it\u2019s part of the game. Honestly, I will not lie to you. I don\u2019t count how many times our players head the ball. Maybe I will get myself in trouble for this. But football is jumping, heading. It\u2019s part of the game.\u201d\nNuno is worried about how Spurs have lost their grip on recent games, with last Sunday\u2019s 3-0 home loss to Chelsea and the midweek Carabao Cup tie at Wolves, which his team won on penalties, turning sharply after set-piece concessions. Thiago Silva scored Chelsea\u2019s opening goal after a corner and Leander Dendoncker\u2019s header for Wolves, also from a corner, saw them cut Spurs\u2019 lead to 2-1. They then equalised for 2-2. On the weekend before last, Spurs could not react after going 1-0 down at Crystal Palace. They lost 3-0.\nThe Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will host Anthony Joshua\u2019s world championship fight against Oleksandr Usyk on Saturday night and Nuno used a boxing analogy to describe how he wanted his team to cover up after being rocked by a setback.\n\u201cAt Wolves, we were in front but the moment that we concede, we didn\u2019t react well,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cWe felt a little bit disorganised. We let the opponent \u2026 not with real danger but having the sensation we were on the back foot. It happened before and we were not able to react. It\u2019s something we must improve on and we are working not only on the mental aspect of the situation but how to react as a team.\n\u201cIn boxing, you cannot spend all the round throwing punches. Sometimes you have to protect yourself. If you get a punch, instead of opening your guard, you should close your guard and respect that your opponent also has these moments. So using this simple situation gives us a lot of what we should do \u2013 so that we are organised, stable and solid.\u201d\nNuno reported that Lucas Moura was fit after his ankle injury.",

        "content": "Thomas Tuchel knows his players must be ready to suffer again. Although Chelsea\u2019s manager has shown it does not take a miracle to outwit Pep Guardiola, he is not arrogant enough to think he has cracked the code when it comes to dealing with Manchester City.\nThere is no chance of Tuchel underestimating these opponents. The German does not believe that he has gained an edge over Guardiola despite three straight victories over him last season.\nTuchel has done his analysis, closely studying the tape of Chelsea\u2019s clever victory in the Champions League final, and the notion that his side will start as favourites when they host the Premier League champions at Stamford Bridge on Saturday does not sit easily with him.\nCity remain the team to beat as far as Tuchel is concerned. He predicted a tough test for his outstanding defence, warning that repelling Guardiola\u2019s side would require huge tactical focus and courage. \u201cWe can never lose intensity or focus against Pep\u2019s teams,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply impossible. I expect another 50-50 match.\u201d\nDespite Tuchel\u2019s humble demeanour, another Chelsea victory would not be a surprise. The European champions unsettled City last season, absorbing pressure before hitting them with incisive counterattacks. It was smart from Tuchel, whose tactics helped Chelsea knock City out of the FA Cup, fight back from a goal down to beat them in the league and stop Guardiola from winning the Champions League for the first time since 2011.\nThere is a sense of a power shift before these sides meet for the first time since the Champions League final. Chelsea will rise six points above City if they win and it will be intriguing to see whether Guardiola corrects the mistake he made in Porto, where he gave his defence no protection by fielding Ilkay G\u00fcndogan in defensive midfield instead of Rodri or Fernandinho.\nChelsea capitalised ruthlessly on that tactical misstep, with N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 dominating midfield, Timo Werner\u2019s pace causing problems and Mason Mount given too much room to create Kai Havertz\u2019s winner.\nEver stubborn, though, Guardiola argued on Friday that City played \u201ca great final\u201d. He suggested Chelsea were simply superior in the long balls and second balls; Tuchel took it as a compliment. \u201cIf you play against Manchester City you need a very complex performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about long balls and second balls, but it\u2019s also about long balls and second balls. It is about escaping the pressure in your passing ability, but it\u2019s also about escaping pressure by dribbling, by courage, by intensity and by winning second balls.\n\u201cIt is about suffering, it is about defending, it is about never becoming too passive. It\u2019s about everything because it\u2019s a huge, huge challenge. They put you under so much pressure and they have so much belief in what they do. Pep\u2019s teams bring out the very best in you.\u201d\nThey certainly bring out the best in Tuchel. He has come a long way since the days when he would visit Munich\u2019s restaurants to have dinner with Guardiola and gain an insight into his thinking. There was a time when people thought Tuchel would never beat the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager, who won four and drew one of their first five meetings.\nTuchel smiled when he remembered falling short with Mainz and Borussia Dortmund when he faced Guardiola\u2019s Bayern. The dynamic is different now. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I arrived at a club with confidence that, OK, if we play at our very best level we can compete with Pep\u2019s team,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cIt means you are in a good place as a coach.\u201d\nChelsea, even more dangerous since adding Romelu Lukaku to their attack, would agree with that assessment. So would Guardiola. He may not be quite so open the next time he meets Tuchel for dinner.",

        "content": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Mohamed Salah ranks alongside Robert Lewandowski as the best goalscorer he has coached, with the Egypt international closing on 100 Premier League goals for Liverpool.\nSalah, 29, requires one goal to reach a league century for Liverpool and his next goal in any competition will make him the 10th-highest scorer in the club\u2019s history. With 99 goals from 150 appearances, he can be the third-fastest to reach the milestone in the league for Liverpool after Roger Hunt (148 games) and Jack Parkinson (149).\nThis week Lewandowski, whom Klopp brought to Borussia Dortmund in 2010, collected the Golden Shoe award for Europe\u2019s top goalscorer in 2020-21. The Liverpool manager believes Salah\u2019s numbers, professionalism and hunger bear comparison to the \u201cabsolutely exceptional\u201d Bayern Munich striker as the Egyptian takes his prolific form \u2013 17 goals in Liverpool\u2019s past 21 away fixtures \u2013 to Brentford on Saturday.\n\u201cMo Salah is absolutely up there with him, there is no doubt about that,\u201d Kloppsaid. \u201cMo is a goal machine. His professionalism is absolutely second to none. He does everything to be always fit and stay on track. First in, last out, all these kind of things \u2013 that\u2019s Mo. On top of that, apart from his technical skill set, he is desperate to score goals and that is helpful as well. That is exactly how it is with Lewi. That\u2019s good and very helpful for a football player.\n\u201cWhatever you do on a pitch, whatever you create, you need somebody who brings the ball over the line and in the back of the net. Mo is absolutely there with the best I ever saw. He knows that. The numbers he has are insane. I\u2019m obviously blessed to work with some good players.\u201d\nKlopp, meanwhile, has expressed dismay at the timing of his team\u2019s trip to Watford after the next international break. Brazil have called up goalkeeper Alisson and midfielder Fabinho, along with six other Premier League players, for their next round of World Cup qualifiers. Klopp is awaiting a resolution to the quarantine issues that marred the last international break \u2013 and Brazil\u2019s third game, against Uruguay, will finish in the early hours (GMT) of Friday 15 October. Liverpool kick off at Vicarage Road at 12.30pm the following day.\nKlopp said: \u201cObviously nobody thought about that and it\u2019s a Liverpool problem, not a problem for anybody else. Good for Watford and all these kind of things, but I just don\u2019t know how you can do these things and nobody reacts on the schedule. The schedule is always a problem but it\u2019s like the TV guys and the Premier League just say: \u2018OK, that\u2019s how it is, they have to play.\u2019 Let\u2019s have a look at how we can sort that. It\u2019s another thing that\u2019s not good for the players and not good for the clubs.\u201d",

        "content": "Pep Guardiola has admitted Manchester City lack the \u201cweapon\u201d of a prolific striker that Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and other rivals possess.\nGuardiola missed out on his summer target Harry Kane after Tottenham refused to sell the centre-forward. United have Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani, Liverpool have Mohamed Salah and Chelsea brought in Romelu Lukaku, all of whom are consistently high scorers. Guardiola stated his team would have to share the goals around, as they did last season when Sergio Ag\u00fcero was injured for long periods.\nThe manager was asked before Saturday\u2019s game at Chelsea whether a centre-forward such as Kane could have made a material difference to his side. \u201cI completely agree with you,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cStrikers are strikers. We don\u2019t have this weapon that teams like Chelsea, United or Tottenham or others have. We don\u2019t have a player to score 25 league goals for himself so we have to do it as a team. This is what we will try this season.\n\u201cThese are the most difficult players to take [buy]. We had the privilege to have Sergio for many years. Unfortunately for the last year and a half he was out with injuries and we could not use him much. We survived without him in a good way \u2013 in the way we played. There are two options that we have right now: complaining or saying we have exceptional players.\u201d\nAlthough Guardiola is operating with a false No 9 this season because of the lack of a striker, he has also done so when having one \u2013 through choice. But he denied that his preferred mode of play, in which midfield is packed, means a bespoke goalscorer is an unnecessary luxury.\n\u201cAlways I had a striker in my career,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cLike goalkeepers, strikers are the biggest specialists. I played with Samuel Eto\u2019o [at Barcelona], maybe the best or one of the best strikers I ever trained. What a player Samuel was. And [Thierry] Henry [at Barcelona], I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a striker or what he is but Lionel Messi was able to score a few goals. There was [Robert] Lewandowski, Thomas M\u00fcller [at Bayern Munich], Sergio here: always I play with a striker. Gabriel [Jesus] likes to play more in lateral ways than central. We want it as a club because I think the club knows, not for me, that it needs a striker in the next years.\u201d\nGuardiola acknowledged that Chelsea, who beat City in May\u2019s Champions League final, are even better after Lukaku joined in the summer from Internazionale.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to deny what a player Romelu Lukaku is,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Inter Milan he took another step. Antonio Conte has the ability to improve every single player that works with him and he came back to the champions of Europe.\n\u201cHow he [Lukaku] plays with long balls, how he is supported by the attacking midfielders and wing-backs and with the quality of players they have in the middle to put the balls between the lines \u2026 it is a stronger team than last season but this is the challenge. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m sad or disappointed regarding the squad we have.\u201d\nGuardiola has injury concerns over Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, John Stones, Rodri, Aymeric Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko. \u201cNot all of them [are in contention],\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them came back to training Friday, but we need to see how they react and tomorrow [Saturday] we will see.\u201d",

        "content": "Two defeats in as many Friday outings were sufficient to see Rory McIlroy left out of a Ryder Cup session for the first time in his career. McIlroy, who made his Ryder Cup debut in 2010 and has featured in 26 matches in succession, was the notable absentee as P\u00e1draig Harrington named his European pairings for day two\u2019s foursomes.\nMcIlroy and Ian Poulter lost 5&3 to Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele in Friday\u2019s foursomes. The Northern Irishman partnered Shane Lowry in the afternoon fourballs but the outcome was similar, this time a 4&3 loss to Tony Finau and Harris English. McIlroy looked out of sorts throughout, with Harrington therefore and unsurprisingly opting to keep him on the sidelines as Europe attempt to rein in a rampant United States team. The hosts lead 6-2 after two sessions.\nHarrington defended McIlroy\u2019s value to the Europeans. \u201cHe is already a leader,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou saw him out there after a tough day, he was out following those matches and supporting his team. He is very much a leader amongst his peers and I couldn\u2019t have asked more from him during the year, I couldn\u2019t have asked more from him today. Yeah, the golf didn\u2019t go as well as he would have liked, but I\u2019m not second-guessing him for a second in terms of his leadership and what he does for my team.\u201d\nJon Rahm and Sergio Garc\u00eda, the only duo to win a match for Europe thus far, will return to take on Brooks Koepka and Daniel Berger in foursomes match one. The English duo of Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton will face Dustin Johnson and Collin Morikawa. Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth will represent the US in match three against Viktor Hovland and Bernd Wiesberger. The final tie sees Lee Westwood and Matt Fitzpatrick combine for a second time, with Schauffele and Cantlay in wait. This means Tommy Fleetwood, despite being unbeaten in five appearances over foursomes and fourballs between 2018 and 2021, is like McIlroy left out.\nSpeaking before his pairings were confirmed, Harrington insisted he was not overly despondent as regards a bruising opening day.\n\u201cClearly not what you wanted, 6-2,\u201d said Harrington. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously still 20 points to play for. We\u2019ve only just played for about 25% at this stage. It isn\u2019t a good start but there\u2019s still a lot to play for.\n\u201cMy team played well today. You know, just a few times, the odd putt didn\u2019t go in and you need a bit of momentum. Coming out tomorrow, obviously we need a big day.\u201d\nThe US captain Steve Stricker revealed Tiger Woods sent words of encouragement via text message to his team on the eve of the Ryder Cup getting under way. \u201cI sent it out to the team, and that\u2019s between us, really,\u201d said Stricker. \u201cBut the overall picture was just wishing the guys good luck and congratulations for making the team and a few personal things from Tiger himself.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of a lot of these guys and these guys look up to him. I lean on him a lot throughout this whole process. So it was great to hear from him and provide some words of encouragement to these guys.\u201d\nStricker insisted there should be no let up from his players despite such a commanding position. The US had previously never led by better than 5\u00bd-2\u00bd after day one since the opposition changed from Great Britain & Ireland to Europe, in the late 1970s. \u201cIt\u2019s a great start, we are very happy with the start,\u201d Stricker said. \u201cBut my message to the guys is, tomorrow is a new day. You know, let\u2019s just go out tomorrow and try to win that first session again in the morning and pretend today never happened. Let\u2019s keep our foot down and continue to play the golf that we know we can play.\u201d",

Hard to look at, but also an opportunity, especially for my son. Sometimes you need to get your hands on something to appreciate its wonder.\nCradled in my arms, the bird seems compact, light and deceptively fragile. But when we open the wings, it is transformed.\n\u201cWoah!\u201d\nMy son says it, but we\u2019re both thinking it \u2013 no matter how many times you see it happen, the unfolding span seems impossibly huge. The smoothness and elasticity of the joints, the stretch and recoil is close to miraculous, and we work the trick\u00a0again\u00a0and\u00a0again.\nHe\u2019s been taught about aerofoils at school, but it\u2019s not an easy shape to understand in two dimensions. Here, though, it all makes sense \u2013 air being forced to slide faster over the upper curve so that it offers less resistance than the slower, bolstering air below.\nWe see how the wing feathers stack and slide with barely a snag, and when a small glitch does occur and the barbs of a feather catch and pull apart, all it takes is one stroke of a finger (or a careful swipe of a beak) to zip them back\u00a0up again.\nThe plumage that most captivates is on the undersides of the wings, the breast and the \u201carmpit\u201d. Its depth and softness provide insulation to large surface areas exposed hour after hour to cold rushing air. But the delicacy and variety of these feathers is unbuzzardly, somehow: they are sienna and russet and a dozen shades of not-quite-white, spotty and banded like the patterns in a multipack of underwear, and just as intimate. A reminder that even the fiercest of hot-blooded creatures needs cosseting.\nWe pluck a few feathers \u2013 and it\u2019s a grim process because they do not succumb easily to such indignity, and their strength is another amazement.\nHe suggests that we might make quills from the larger ones and we talk about pens made from feathers, oak gall ink, paper from trees, and how from all that wildness came the written word.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

This week, the classic and versatile button-through dress\nThe buttoned dress is the fashion pro\u2019s secret weapon for weather that hasn\u2019t quite made up its mind yet. Light fabrics with sleeves provide a great combination for in-between seasons. They also work across body shapes (a tea-dress style is great for D cups and above) and occasions (trainers for daytime, knee-length boots for evening).\nThere are tricks to maxing out the versatility of this style. Wear open as an alternative to a long shirt or a light cardigan or, if you\u2019re not keen on showing too much skin, put a T-shirt or poloneck underneath. Those with crafty abilities can also change boring buttons to something more exciting with a trip to a haberdashery department.\nA shorter-length buttoned dress has a more casual feel. Bold retro prints worthy of The Queen\u2019s Gambit stand out, while gold buttons on a red dress break up the colour of an easy shift style. Prints like polka dots work for summer but they have life beyond September. Just add tights to wear all year round.

Hot Jalape\u00f1o quads, since both are unmistakably green while their neutral undertones keep things appropriately adult.\nPersonally, I\u2019d recommend choosing just one green shade and fluffing it all over the lid with a medium brush, stopping a fraction beyond the crease, using a smaller one to add a little of the same under the lower lashes, then cracking straight on with mascara.\nThere\u2019s something more playful and cool about the monochromatic look than faffing around with multiple tones, textures and shades that you\u2019d more usually see on Strictly. My preference here is for single cream shadows and, even on my green eyes, I\u2019ve seen striking results from minimal effort with Glossier Lidstar in Herb (a glistening GI-fatigues green, 4.5ml for \u00a315) and Stila\u2019s matte Suede Shade Liquid Eye Shadow in Enchanted Earth (4.5ml for \u00a320), a sort of guacamole-on-the-turn.\n\nThis article comes from Saturday,\u00a0the new print magazine from the Guardian\u00a0which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package.

        "content": "Divisions between progressives and moderates in Congress are threatening to scuttle a $3.5tn social spending program and a $1tn infrastructure bill\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez cannot have been surprised that wearing a \u201cTax the Rich\u201d dress to New York\u2019s Met gala would trigger performative outrage from the right. But it also earned blowback from closer to home.\nEric Adams, a Black police veteran who won the party\u2019s mayoral primary by appealing to its centre, argued that \u201cwhen you talk about just blanketly saying \u2018tax the rich\u2019 in this city\u201d, it would potentially drive away firefighters, teachers and other taxpayers on whom the city depends. He advocated cutting wasteful spending instead.\nThe pro-business Adams and the democratic socialist congresswoman are two faces of a 193-year-old Democratic party confronting fundamental questions about what it stands for and what it wants to be. While Democrats have moved left on both economic and social issues since the 1990s, this remains a broad and unwieldy coalition by global standards.\nNow its diverse and at times discordant voices in Washington are imperiling the agenda of Joe Biden, a longtime centrist who has nevertheless embraced some of the radically transformative ambitions of past Democratic giants such as Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson.\nDivisions between progressives and moderates in Congress are threatening to scuttle a $3.5tn social spending program, which includes childcare, education and green energy measures, and a $1tn bipartisan infrastructure bill that has passed the Senate and is pending in the House of Representatives.\n\u201cUnfortunately for us, at a time when it\u2019s so very important for Democrats to make it clear to the people that we serve where we stand, we couldn\u2019t be more inconsistent with our values right now,\u201d said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of the progressive group Democracy for America. \u201cWe can\u2019t get all on the same page to get this done.\u201d\nFor four years of the Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Democrats of all stripes united against a common political foe. Since January, however, they have controlled all the levers of power \u2013 with House and Senate majorities so razor-thin that every disagreement is thrown into sharp relief against staunch Republican opposition.\nDemocrats cannot afford to lose more than three votes in the House, and none in the Senate, if they are to pass the social package that has earned comparisons with Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Deal\u201d and Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d in its reassertion of government\u2019s power to improve lives.\nThere is added pressure from the expectation that Republicans are likely to win back the House and possibly the Senate in midterm elections in November of next year. The clock is ticking.\nModerate Democrats back a vote on the $1tn bill for roads, bridges, ports and broadband connections scheduled for the House on Monday. But they have also raised objections to the size of the $3.5tn social spending package, warning against government overreach that will drive up the national debt.\nSenator Joe Manchin, who represents heavily Republican West Virginia, has said he will not vote for $3.5trn, preferring instead a total of $1tn to $1.5tn. His Senate colleague, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, also wants to trim the cost.\nBut progressives have vowed to defend the price tag of $3.5tn over 10 years, having already come down from $6tn. They have also said they will not vote for the infrastructure plan without first passing the social spending program, using a manoeuver called \u201creconciliation,\u201d which avoids the Senate requirement for a supermajority.\nProgressives argue that opinion polls show broad bipartisan support for the plan and accuse the moderates of being beholden to corporate interests. Manchin, for example, owns a big stake in a private coal brokerage and his election campaigns have received donations from lobbyists for the oil giant Exxon.\nSimpson said: \u201cIf we have certain members of our caucus who want to take money from Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big \u2018insert name here\u2019, then we\u2019re never going to have a Democratic majority that\u2019s willing to actually serve real people first.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s really not Democrat versus Republican. It\u2019s the ultra wealthy and the corporations versus all the rest of us because a bill like this in the midst of a pandemic should be very easy to pass. This is a part of Biden\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s actually already a compromise position because progressives wanted way more.\u201d\nThe scale of ambition is a marker of how far the party has journeyed since, from the ashes of a third consecutive election defeat in 1988, it turned to Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to lead the \u201cNew Democrats\u201d (later an inspiration for Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour) to the political centre ground and back to the White House.\nAl From, who founded the Democratic Leadership Council in 1985 and handpicked Clinton for the job, is still putting the case for centrism. He points out that Biden comfortably beat Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, in last year\u2019s primary and contends that the significance of progressives is \u201cexaggerated\u201d by cable news networks and Twitter.\nFrom also notes that the six progressives who comprise \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House are from safe Democratic strongholds, whereas the moderates are from competitive swing districts. \u201cThe voters that are going to decide who\u2019s controlling the Congress are probably going to be suburban voters and college graduates, and women are going to be key to that also,\u201d he said. \u201cThe suburban voters tend to be more fiscally moderate.\n\u201cThe vote on the $3.5trn bill is automatic for the progressive caucus because they want to spend all the money in the world. But for the moderates, it may be an election deciding vote because the constituencies that they need to win often vote Republican and tend to be more conservative on economic issues. Part of what this fight is about goes back to who you represent and whose votes you need to get elected.\u201d\nFrom cautioned against viewing the debate as evidence a Democratic identity crisis, however. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a coalition party,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a very broad tent stretched all across the spectrum. It\u2019s probably less now, in terms of the breadth of a party, that it has been historically. Thirty or 40 years ago it was even a lot more divided.\u201d\nThe current impasse has led to some terse exchanges on Capitol Hill and forced Biden, a 36-year veteran of the Senate, to step in this week by hosting both moderates and progressives for talks at the White House. Much also depends on Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, displaying their political chess-playing skills.\nIt is a sign of progressive gains in recent years that Pelosi and Schumer have expressed support for their goals and that Sanders is now chairman of the influential Senate budget committee (he has warned plainly: \u201cNo infrastructure bill without the $3.5tn reconciliation bill.\u201d) Biden, a surprise radical at 78, appears to have set the tone for the party.\nMatt Bennett, executive vice-president for public affairs at the Third Way thinktank and a former official in the Clinton White House, said: \u201cWhen your party has the White House, you have an identity and the identity is personified by the president for good or bad.\n\u201cRepublicans for a time were having an identity crisis under Trump because you saw people exiting the party in large numbers, particularly their intelligentsia. The core of the Bush administration announced they were opposed to a Republican president. That\u2019s an identity crisis. What we\u2019re having is a debate.\u201d\nIt is a debate set to rage on, further complicated by Republicans reasserting their vow not to help Democrats raise the federal government\u2019s debt limit before a mid-October deadline. The various moving parts look set to make or break Biden\u2019s presidency and prove a defining chapter in the Democratic party\u2019s long history.\nLeah Greenberg, co-founder and co-executive director of the Indivisible Project, a progressive nonprofit organisation, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a cohesive identity of a big faction of the Democratic party, ranging from the president to progressives; it really shows the total ideological and political incoherence of the conservative Democratic bloc.\n\u201cThey just have random feelings about the price tag, various preferences around not taxing the rich, not actually limiting corporate power, et cetera. The fight here is not even between moderates and progressives. It\u2019s between people who are trying to deliver on the full Democratic agenda and people who are trying to take bites out of it for complicated, incoherent reasons, usually involving delivering for corporate donors.\u201d\nAnd while Manchin and Ocasio-Cortez belonging to the same party might seem a recipe for political dysfunction, it is still in a different league from events across the aisle over the past decade.\nGreenberg added: \u201cThe dominant story in American politics is not necessarily the changes in the Democratic party. It is the fact that the Republican party has just been completely unmoored from political reality, from any commitment to democracy, and is hell bent on using the tools it has in order to maintain and exert power.\u201d",

        "content": "Those worst hit by global heating are left out of talks, says feminist coalition calling for systemic change\nWomen must be enabled to play a greater role at the Cop26 summit, as the needs of women and girls are being overlooked amid the global climate crisis, a coalition of feminist groups has said.\nThe Global Women\u2019s Assembly for Climate Justice has laid out a call for action at the UN general assembly, including demands that world leaders meeting at Cop26, in Glasgow this November, must end fossil fuel expansion and move to 100% renewable energy.\nMore than 120 groups have signed the call, to be presented at a six-day online forum starting on Saturday, which also includes demands to promote women\u2019s leadership and equity, protect the rights of indigenous peoples, improve food security, recognise a human right to water, and to protect forests, oceans and other ecosystems.\nOsprey Orielle Lake, of the Women\u2019s Earth and Climate Action Network, and convener of the assembly, said: \u201cEvery day, we can see for ourselves forest fires burning, massive flooding, extreme droughts, people losing their livelihoods and lives\u2013 \u2013 we are in a global climate emergency.\n\u201cAs the world prepares for one of the most important climate talks since the Paris agreement, we know solutions exist, and that women are leading the way.\u201d\nShe said Cop26 must deliver a pathway to limiting global heating to 1.5C, and help people around the world \u2013 particularly women and children, who are often the worst affected \u2013 build resilience to the impacts of the climate crisis.\n\u201cWe need systemic change,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work if we just barrel through another Cop and nothing happens.\u201d\nAs women are responsible in many countries for gathering fuel, water and food, they often suffer the most when shortages are caused or made worse by the climate crisis. As they are usually lacking land rights, they are also more likely to be displaced in climate disasters. Studies have also found the climate crisis exacerbates gender-based violence against women.\nNeema Namadamu, founder of the Synergy of Congolese Women\u2019s Associations, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said: \u201cI was born in the forest, my whole being is from the forest. Women are on the frontline, working for climate justice and affected by climate change. We are planting trees \u2013 without trees there is no life. We cook with fires and have fires for light at night. We really need to start working together.\u201d\nMany of the remedies to the climate crisis would also benefit women. For instance, replacing cooking fires with solar stoves would reduce indoor air pollution that affects women and children more as they spend more time at home. Bringing clean renewable energy to low-income countries would enable more women and girls to gain access to education, as without electricity they often lack the means to study after nightfall.\nMary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, former president of Ireland and chair of the Elders group of world leaders, has long been a critic of the lack of women\u2019s representation at Cops, the \u201cconference of the parties\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cWe need to centre women and girls in the climate context \u2013 women need to be included at the table. The UK promised the most inclusive Cop, but it is not. The Covid crisis has exacerbated and cemented gender inequality, and we need to build on the gender action plan [agreed at the last Cop, in Madrid, in 2019].\u201d\nThe Guardian revealed last year that the UK as host country was fielding an all-male top team for Glasgow, headed by the cabinet minister and Cop president Alok Sharma, with 10 ministers, civil servants and other officials who were all male. The government came under heavy criticism after the revelation, and appointed Anne-Marie Trevelyan, now trade secretary, as a \u201cchampion\u201d to focus on climate adaptation and resilience. About 45% of the Cop26 unit are now women, but almost all of the most senior public-facing roles are taken by men.\nDuring the two-week Cop26 summit, there will be a day devoted to gender issues, which will include a discussion of the gender action plan.\nA Cop26 spokesperson said: \u201cWomen and girls have a critical role to play in the fight against the climate crisis \u2013 as decision-makers, educators and advocates at all levels. Progress is being made, with women among some of the most influential figures in international climate diplomacy today, but there is more to be done.\n\u201cThe UK is committed to championing diversity and inclusivity throughout our Cop26 presidency and advancing gender equality in climate action and finance.\u201d\nDipti Bhatnagar, of Friends of the Earth International, said there were concerns that women from low-income countries would face obstacles coming to Glasgow, as arrivals from red list countries must quarantine in the UK.\nThe UK government is running a pre-Cop vaccination programme for delegates and has pledged to fund the required quarantine stays for registered attenders, including party delegates, observers and media from the global south who would otherwise find it difficult to attend the conference.\nHowever, Bhatnagar said: \u201cCop26 going ahead in person is very unsafe and inequitable now. Many organisations have demanded the UK government postpone.\u201d",

Arriving there, shivering and nithered (Yorkshire only), you stand dripping in the doorway, wondering if such a forlorn wayfarer can possibly be welcome. But you are indeed, and before too long, fuelled by divine nectar (any real ale will do), and in front of a sacred fire (logs or peat, no electric flame stuff), you will be blessed with a mystical insight, part of which is the conviction that you\u2019ve had a lovely day and must plan the next one.\nThis article includes content provided by Google. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nClearly the pub is the more important element here, so let\u2019s start with a great one: the Green Dragon in Hardraw in the Yorkshire Dales, an ancient cave-like inn. As you enter, your eyes adjust to the subdued lighting, catching the gleam of brass and glass amid all the dark woodwork. Laughter and voices are heard from distant hidden corners and then you spy the bar, like a beacon of hope and friendliness, calling you forward. However \u2013 Aristotle\u2019s ghostly hand catches your arm \u2013 before you get settled in, let\u2019s get things in the right order: bar room catharsis cannot be achieved without some prior effort, namely walking.\nWhat really makes the Green Dragon stand out is one of its more unusual features: Hardraw Force, a waterfall over 30 metres high, the longest single drop in England. Sadly, the madness that is health and safety dictates that this aquanormous attraction is not actually allowed inside the building, but must be kept a short distance from the pub, up a winding path in a mysterious green grotto of its own making. On a wet day, and they do get a few, the force is an impressive sight. (After a dry spell it\u2019s hardly worth the bother.)\nIn previous times the only route to the waterfall was through the public bar, which means both JMW Turner and William Wordsworth passed this way, as both visited the waterfall.\nHardcore Green Dragon buffs will say that this modest walk is a perfectly sufficient amount of exercise before the settle down inside, but there are those hiking fanatics who require a longer stretch. Thankfully the entire area is riddled with opportunities to knacker yourself. Down the valley is the town of Hawes, where you can load up with vittles such as Wensleydale cheese, sausage rolls and pies at Elijah Allen\u2019s grocery. The town has become a pit stop for motorbikers and can be a bit hectic on a summer\u2019s day (there is certainly no shortage of small cafes and trinket shops). The Wensleydale Creamery does tours and sells myriad flavoured varieties, none of which come close to matching the superlative deliciousness of the original.\n\nThis article comes from Saturday,\u00a0the new print magazine from the Guardian\u00a0which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI.\nThe big geographical division here comes at about 400 metres. Below that altitude is the valley, where most inhabitants live and where long processional lines of traffic are often led on impromptu tours by an imperturbable tractor. Never imagine you will get far quickly in Wensleydale: it is possible to come here looking for rural tranquillity and beauty and spend all your time staring at the rear end of the car in front, cursing motorised transport. The only sensible solution is to dump the car as soon as possible, then walk up above that 400-metre division into a very different world, a place of tussock grass, sheep, grumbling grouse and massive panoramic vistas.\nFrom Hawes, the quickest route into this magical upper realm is to take the Pennine Way south up the long, slow ridge via Ten End to Dodd Fell, which will bring some impressive views. Continue southwards, descending to the Roman road which will turn you east, up on to Wether Fell, from where it is a short descent back to Hawes.\nEven better, however, is to start from the Green Dragon itself. Give it a good long stare, as entry to this fine temple of beer is the end goal of your walk. Now head west across the bridge and soon you will spot the Pennine Way sign. From here, an old green drovers\u2019 path leads up above the tree line, where the path becomes a well-laid stone slab pavement heading north up the flank of Great Shunner Fell. The panoramas open up as you climb. You will reach the summit after around five miles (although Black Hill Moss at halfway would make an early finish). At 716 metres, Great Shunner is not to be underestimated: there isn\u2019t a day in summer when gloves and a warm hat might not be welcome up here, but there is a drystone windbreak with benches. The vistas of great Yorkshire peaks such as Ingleborough and Great Whernside \u2013 and High Seat in the Lake District \u2013 are superb.\nThe route back depends on the weather and stamina: hardcore hikers will want to loop back to either west or east. If there\u2019s a hoolie blowing, I recommend a safe return by the way you came and quickly into the Green Dragon. Ignore the sign at the door sending hippies around the back: it\u2019s a typical bit of eccentricity. In fact, everything here is idiosyncratic: new landlords Ann Rennoldson and Chris Robinson were regular visitors before taking the place on, so they know.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a steep learning curve,\u201d says Ann, who was a teacher in Leeds until recently, \u201cbut we are loving it.\u201d One particular peculiarity is that musicians can turn up at any moment and start \u201cticking\u201d, knocking out a tune that someone else will join in. Before too long the bar is rocking. There are also regular organised music weekends to look out for. Find walk notes at mudandroutes.com\nTaproom aficionados love the Green Dragon\u2019s cosy nooks and corners with their ancient settles and spindle-back chairs: the warren of rooms dates back seven centuries in places. You are never far from a decent warm fire, or the beer pumps: Butter Tubs bitter (from Askrigg), Timothy Taylor\u2019s Landlord (from Keighley) and Semer Water pale ale (by Wensleydale Brewery in nearby Leyburn) are regular offerings at this free house. Fish and chips can be had and curries are another speciality, but Yorkshire pudding is a notable absentee from the menu. (Connoisseurs are directed south to the Crooked Billet in Saxton, whose Yorkshire Pudding Challenge promises three courses all containing the paradisaical batter.)\nThe Green Dragon has en suite rooms (from \u00a3100 B&B) close to the pub or a little further away for countryside views. There are also bunk rooms that sleep between four and eight (from \u00a330pp). Chris and Ann have plans for some rejuvenation, but the accommodation is comfortable, if a little old-fashioned, with quilted bedspreads and muted colour schemes. This will never be a swanky boutique experience: it\u2019s all about the craic and the atmosphere in a friendly, ancient hostelry. greendragonhardraw.com",

        "content": "Historians, film-makers and forensic scientists try to answer question once and for all as centenary nears\nIt is the shot that a century later still echoes around Ireland as an unanswered question: who killed Michael Collins?\nOn this much, everyone agrees: a bullet to the head killed the revolutionary leader on 22 August 1922 near B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, a village in County Cork, during Ireland\u2019s civil war. Who did it, and why, remains a source of controversy and speculation that now bubbles as strong as ever.\nThe upcoming centenary, and the discovery of new evidence about a suspect, have prompted historians, film-makers and forensic scientists to reinvestigate Collins\u2019s death \u2013 with some calling for another autopsy.\n\u201cWe should exhume the body and find out the nature of the wounds, otherwise we\u2019ll be talking about this for another century,\u201d said Paddy Cullivan, an academic turned film-maker.\nCollins was a leader of the original Irish Republican Army (IRA), a guerrilla force that fought British forces to a stalemate during Ireland\u2019s war of independence from 1919 to 1921. He signed a treaty with the British government that granted 26 of Ireland\u2019s 32 counties de facto independence as the Irish Free State. IRA hardliners rejected the treaty, leading to a bitter civil war.\nCollins was leading the provisional Irish government to victory over the anti-treaty side when his convoy was ambushed at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th. He dismounted and was firing back when he was shot and killed, aged 31.\nAn information vacuum opened up: there was no inquiry, no death certificate and the autopsy report was lost.\nMost people accept one of the ambushers fired the fatal bullet, but there is dispute over the identity of the shooter and whether the shot was a fluke, a ricochet or the work of a skilled sniper given it was fired at dusk, in poor visibility, from more than 150 metres (490ft) away.\nLee Harvey Oswald, in contrast, was about 100 metres from John F Kennedy and needed three shots in bright sunshine to kill the US president.\nThere is also dispute over whether the anti-treaty leader \u00c9amon de Valera, who was in the area at the time, knew of the ambush. Neil Jordan\u2019s 1996 biopic, Michael Collins, depicted him as complicit. De Valera went on to lead Ireland as taoiseach and president.\nAnother version says Collins\u2019s own comrades in the convoy fired the fatal shot, possibly in an alcohol-fuelled blunder since some had been drinking, or as part of a conspiracy by government figures to remove a rival. Yet another theory claims British intelligence orchestrated the killing to stop Collins subverting Northern Ireland, which remained under British rule.\nThe state broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has lined up detectives, academics, psychologists and the retired state pathologist Prof Marie Cassidy to examine the evidence in an upcoming documentary, Cold Case Collins.\nIn the 1980s a former IRA member endorsed longstanding rumours that the shooter was Denis \u201cSonny\u201d O\u2019Neill, a marksman who served in the British army during the first world war before joining the anti-treaty IRA.\nBut Cullivan recently combed German and British archives that said O\u2019Neill returned home from the trenches with a 40% disability to his right arm, casting doubt on his assassin credentials.\nCullivan has made a documentary, The Murder of Michael Collins, that leaves the shooter\u2019s identity unresolved. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that the most important man in Ireland at that time doesn\u2019t get an inquest or a death certificate. The whole thing is beyond strange.\u201d\nDiarmaid Ferriter, a leading historian who has published a book on the civil war, Between Two Hells, said the murkiness around Collins\u2019s death allowed myths to flourish. The nascent Irish state claimed his last words were \u201cforgive them\u201d, an unlikely story intended to exalt Collins\u2019s life as a \u201ctragic unfinished symphony\u201d, said Ferriter.\n\u201cClassic propaganda. You want to depict your fallen leader as beyond pure, generous even in death. We forget the ordinariness of what happened. He was foolhardy to stop and return fire. There was drink taken. Mistakes made that seem obvious in retrospect.\u201d\nThe historian doubts the theory that Emmet Dalton, one of Collins\u2019s senior aides, killed his chief, accidentally or on purpose, and covered it up. \u201cHe must have been a hell of an actor to carry that lie. He was in awe of Collins and became a keeper of the flame.\u201d\nFerriter said debate over the shooter\u2019s identity distracted from the more important task of understanding a conflict that scarred Ireland. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of silence around the civil war, a lot of trauma internalised.\u201d\nThe author Brendan Lynch is an outspoken critic who accuses Collins of provoking a murderous campaign against first world war veterans \u2013 as depicted in Lynch\u2019s novel The Old Gunner and his Medals \u2013 and of diverting Ireland from a path to peaceful independence. \u201cA man of violence and victim of his own pride. He left cover and was shot, simple as that. Lived by the sword and died by the sword. It\u2019s not a popular opinion: it\u2019s like casting aspersions on a saint.\u201d",

        "content": "In the 1960s, 007 was a glamorous antidote to postwar austerity, but now he\u2019s more laughable than heroic. Can the Bond brand survive, post-Brexit?\nThese blithering women,\u201d said James Bond, \u201cwho thought they could do a man\u2019s work? Why the hell couldn\u2019t they stay at home and mind their pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip and leave men\u2019s work to the men?\u201d\nIan Fleming wrote this in his spy\u2019s first adventure, 1953\u2019s Casino Royale, starting as he meant to go on. Dr No, published five years later, sees Bond and Honeychile Rider incarcerated in the eponymous evil genius\u2019s lair. \u201cHoney, get into that bath before I spank you,\u201d Bond says, and Rider obediently does. \u201cShe said provocatively: \u2018You\u2019ve got to wash me. I don\u2019t know what to do. You\u2019ve got to show me.\u2019\u201d\nNearly 70 years on and the old misogynist with his infantile projections is finally getting the symbolic castration he has long deserved. In the much-delayed Bond movie No Time to Die, the new 007 (Nomi, played by the British actor Lashana Lynch) tells the old one: \u201cThe world has moved on, Commander Bond.\u201d While Daniel Craig\u2019s Bond has been furloughed, Nomi has replaced him at MI6, taking his licence to kill in the process.\nTrue, No Time to Die\u2019s plot is microwaved hokum. Bond is back from retirement to take down Rami Malek\u2019s Safin, an uber-villain with an east European accent and a Phantom of the Opera mask. What\u2019s new is that Bond is second fiddle to the kind of woman who would once have been tasked with jumping into bed implausibly quickly. \u201cYou get in my way, I will put a bullet in your knee,\u201d Nomi tells Bond, before adding brutally: \u201cThe one that works.\u201d The implication is clear: British intelligence is no longer best served by a pale, male and stale former public schoolboy, but by a young woman of colour with more firepower, one imagines, than a Beretta in her stocking top. (Who knows, Nomi may even get a surname.) And she is right: the world has changed and Bond may no longer be fit for purpose.\nBond is a creation of the cold war, when, as Sean Egan puts it in James Bond: The Secret History, \u201cBritain\u2019s empire was sufficiently intact as to make plausible the idea that the UK could be an important player on the world espionage stage.\u201d In his early years, Bond was a glamorous antidote to a glum time. Britain was emerging from postwar austerity only to see its empire disappearing over the horizon. For a grey nation getting by on powdered eggs and Spam, this rogue male\u2019s cultivation of the finer things in life \u2013 meticulously prepared martinis, a supercharged Bentley, intercontinental leg-overs \u2013 suggested that Britain could still rule the waves and waive the rules.\nBy the 1960s, Fleming supposed the cold war would soon end and so devised a new enemy to ensure his brand did not become obsolete. Spectre, the villainous cabal fronted on screen by Donald Pleasence\u2019s cat-stroking megalomaniac weirdo Ernst Stavro Blofeld, replaced the Soviet counter-espionage organisation Smersh as Bond\u2019s adversary. This shift freed the franchise from the burden of geopolitical plausibility and imagined the future\u2019s clash of civilisations as a sequence of nuked-up nutjobs holding the world to ransom.\nBond had a new enemy, but no new politics. Womankind was reduced to a sexual sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord, a thought punched up by Roald Dahl in his script for You Only Live Twice. \u201cWhy do Chinese girls taste so different from the others?\u201d Sean Connery\u2019s Bond says to his love interest Ling, played by Tsai Chen, adding: \u201cLike Peking duck is different from Russian caviar. But I love them both.\u201d His attitude to lesbians was more straightforward: they were either to be killed (Rosa Klebb) or \u201ccured\u201d (Pussy Galore).\nBut it did not seem to matter that 007 was racist, sexist, homophobic and increasingly silly. Along with the Beatles and swinging London, the franchise had become one of Britain\u2019s best sources of soft power. According to Jaap Verheul in The Cultural Life of James Bond: Specters of 007, the franchise was mainly a British affair in the 1950s, the novels read chiefly by lower-middle class men. That changed with the first four Bond films, which took the brand global in the 1960s. Goldfinger was particularly important in that respect, being partly set in the US and thus breaking the US market in a way paralleled only by the Beatles. Indeed, Beatlemania and Bondmania went hand in hand: I Want to Hold Your Hand was the Fab Four\u2019s first US No 1 in 1964, while, in the same year, Goldfinger recouped its $3m (\u00a32.1m) budget in its first two weeks. It grossed $ 46m worldwide and was at one point the fastest-grossing film of all time. The bestselling toy that year was Bond\u2019s Aston Martin DB5.\nBut there was a curious irony in all this global domination, set out by Simon Winder in his book The Man Who Saved Britain: A Personal Journey into the Disturbing World of James Bond. As the franchise went global, the body count of foreigners rose accordingly. \u201cAs the 1960s progressed,\u201d wrote Winder, \u201cBond\u2019s ability to maim and kill foreigners became a great consolation to millions of embittered and confused people whose traditional world picture had changed with alarming speed.\u201d By then, Bond was \u201cpretty much the only British national capable of damaging anybody at all\u201d.\nWhat should have done for Bond was not Rosa Klebb\u2019s shoe-knife, but time. He had always been somewhat risible even to fans, a quality heroically indulged by post-Connery Bonds such as Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. By the 1990s, Mike Myers\u2019s Austin Powers movies made the silliness explicit (Alotta Fagina, Ivana Humpalot), quickly followed by Rowan Atkinson\u2019s own parody, Johnny English, while the Simpsons introduced the fan favourite, Dr No-like nemesis Hank Scorpio. (\u201cHomer \u2013 what\u2019s your least favourite country, Italy or France?\u201d \u201cFrance,\u201d replies Homer. \u201cNobody ever says Italy,\u201d chuckles Scorpio, ominously pushing a button.)\nWith the rise of vulnerable-but-tough 21st-century action heroes such as Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne and Jack Reacher, retooling the Bond franchise in 2006 was a delicate business. \u201cIf something\u2019s been parodied as much as that, there\u2019s a reason for it,\u201d Daniel Craig told me before the release of Casino Royale. That film made Bond compelling anew: he was tougher and more serious, but sympathetic, too: an orphan, a man who seemed capable of real love with realistic women, and who didn\u2019t mind answering to Judi Dench\u2019s matriarch M.\nWhen Craig\u2019s Bond and the Queen parachuted into the Olympic Stadium for the 2012 opening ceremony (both stunt doubles \u2013 their insurance premiums would have trebled the national debt), it was a symbolic moment. Two brands, both of which had arguably outlived their historical usefulness and would surely be wound down when Britain emerged as a truly egalitarian and diverse polity, were, as much as the NHS, made to typify the country not just as it was but, counterintuitively, as it was going to be.\nThe next Bond film, Skyfall, became the biggest-grossing instalment in the 007 franchise so far. According to Forbes, the Bond movies have raked in more than $7bn (\u00a35.06bn) worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing franchise of all time behind Marvel and Star Wars. Kate Arthurs, the British Council\u2019s former director of arts, cited Bond along with Shakespeare, the Premier League, the royal family, the BBC and the English language as among the reasons that the UK pipped France to the top of the Soft Power 30 Index in 2018. One estimate suggests one in five people on Earth have seen a Bond film \u2013 and it is quite likely that most of the other 80% still know that the man likes his martinis shaken, not stirred.\nIt is arguable that the descent of Her Majesty and her tuxedoed lickspittle was a sign of what was to come in British politics, possessing the same unabashed patriotism and insistence on British exceptionalism that fuelled the daydreams for which we will be paying for decades. Now the 25th Bond movie arrives in a strange new world. In 1953, Britain still had an empire. In 2015, when the last film, Spectre, was released, we were still in the EU. Today a postcolonial, post-Brexit Britain is a geopolitical nonentity: friendless in Europe, clinging to the US, and humiliated in a recent postage stamp dispute by, with all due respect, a dot in the Indian Ocean called Mauritius.\n\nThis article comes from Saturday,\u00a0the new print magazine from the Guardian\u00a0which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI.\nCan James Bond continue to represent Britain with a new twist on the old cocktail, or should the franchise be terminated? Certainly this Bond, with his gammy knee and other physical shortcomings, suggests the latter: abseiling off bridges and going toe-to-toe with Johnny Foreigners 30 years his junior may finally be beyond him.\nIt might well be a good thing if Daniel Craig\u2019s licence to kill is permamently taken over by Lynch\u2019s Nomi, or even Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, the 31-year-old Bridgerton heart-throb and other rumoured Bond successor. Although, what could be more British than an old white guy thwarting opportunities for others by hanging around too long?\nNo Time to Die is in cinemas from Thursday. \n This article was amended on 25 September 2021.

Candlelit vigils were also held across the country, from Glasgow to Margate to Bath.\nNessa\u2019s killing has triggered an outpouring of emotion and anger, especially among women, and reignited concerns about the level of danger women face in Britain.\nSpeaking to the BBC on Saturday morning, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, said the police need to do more to make the streets safe for women and girls after Nessa\u2019s death.\nBaird, who said she attended a vigil for Nessa in Wood Green, London, on Friday evening, said there needed to be more onus on police to protect the public than on women to take precautions.\nShe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cApparently the police have been giving out rape alarms to women and giving leaflets out saying how to stay safe in a public place. It is less, isn\u2019t it, about giving women leaflets on keeping themselves safe in dangerous places and more about the police making the streets safe for women?\u201d\nNessa is believed to have been killed after leaving her home on Astell Road about 8.30pm last Friday to meet a friend at the Depot bar. The journey should have taken her five minutes.\nPolice fear the prime suspect for her murder may still be at large and are urgently seeking a man captured in CCTV images taken close to where she was found dead on Sunday. Two men arrested in connection with the alleged murder have been released under further investigation.\nThe balding man in the footage, who is seen dressed in black hooded coat and grey jeans and apparently clutching a red or orange object in his right hand, was in Pegler Square on the evening Nessa was attacked. Anyone with information about him is urged to come forward and contact police.\nWhen it was put to Baird that there needed to be societal change along with police intervention, she said: \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t just a job for the police but, look, the police do have a very key role here.\n\u201cThree-quarters of women over 16 have been harassed in a public place and don\u2019t feel safe. They need to know that the police understand that and will use all the powers they have got to keep the streets safe.\u201d",

His group PowerCA Action reached more than a quarter-million voters ahead of election day, encouraging young Latino Californians to head to the polls.\nIt\u2019s not that he is particularly invested in Newsom\u2019s career.\n\u201cFor us the recall was never about saving Gavin Newsom\u2019s political future,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, the executive director of PowerCA action, which focused its efforts in the state\u2019s agricultural Central Valley. \u201cIt was about ensuring that this state didn\u2019t move backward to when the state and the administration were much more xenophobic.\u201d\nNewsom, a Democrat, last week handily defeated the Republican-led effort to remove him from office in a rare gubernatorial recall. In an election that depended on turnout, it\u2019s clear that the Latino vote has played a decisive role in the results, experts say.\nAbout 40% of the population in California and about 30% of registered voters are Latino, and though votes are still being tallied, it appears they voted largely Democratic.\nTurned off by Republicans who have portrayed brown immigrants as \u201cpunching bags and the scapegoats\u201d, naturalized Latino immigrants and the children of immigrants in the west \u2013 including those with some conservative views \u2013 have long overwhelmingly voted with Democrats, S\u00e1nchez said.\nIt wasn\u2019t any different in the recall. The effort to remove Newsom from office was launched by a former sheriff\u2019s deputy from the Central Valley who once advocated microchipping migrants. Newsom\u2019s lead opponent in the election \u2013 conservative radio host Larry Elder \u2013 frequently characterized Latino residents as criminals.\n\u201cFor a lot of Latino voters that kind of ended the debate on how to vote,\u201d said Hairo Cortes, the executive director of Chispa, a progressive political group based in Orange county.\nYet despite the stakes of the election, said Cortes, candidates from both parties didn\u2019t really make an effort to engage Latino voters until the very last minute, when tight polls suggested that a distracted, disappointed electorate may sit out the vote.\n\u201cA similar thing happened in 2020, and 2018, and 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like once campaign season rolls around, outreach to Latinos comes in as part of a mad scramble for votes.\u201d\nNewsom, who had a track record of appointing Latino offcials to key political and administrative positions, and expanding education and healthcare access to undocumented immigrants, initially failed to emphasize those wins and signal more to come ahead of the recall, said Christian Arana, a vice-president of the Latino Community Foundation.\nSo the responsibility to turn out the vote was left in large part to Latino-led grassroots organizations \u2013 many with tight budgets that didn\u2019t include enough funds to cover the canvassing costs in an unexpected special election.\nWithout meaningful outreach from the campaigns, many Latino voters in California\u2019s Inland Empire and Coachella Valley hadn\u2019t noticed the ballots in their mail, said Luz Gallegos, the executive director of TODEC, a non-partisan group based in Perris.\nOthers had turned away purposefully from the election, she said, angry and disappointed that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers had forgotten or forsaken their communities.\nAcross the state, Latino workers in agricultural fields, meatpacking plants, grocery stores and other industries that were deemed \u201cessential\u201d during the worst of the pandemic disproportionately got sick from and died of Covid-19. Latino Californians remain disproportionately unvaccinated, even as hospitals in some parts of the state are overwhelmed by a new wave of the pandemic.\n\u201cPeople were healing from sickness, and healing from loss,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cWe knew that the community was not thinking of civic engagement, they were thinking of survival.\u201d Many organizers had to get creative, she added \u2013 her own group rallied a troupe of volunteers and a mariachi band to serenade would-be voters.\nSuch efforts have paid off across the state, including in the agricultural Central Valley, once a Republican bastion, where progressive organizing prowess seems to have help narrow the gap between Democrats and Republicans.\nIn the valley\u2019s Merced county, early returns suggested that about three-quarters of Latino voters rejected the recall, while three-quarters of white voters supported it. In nearby Fresno, where \u200b\u200bthe Latino population increased by 15.5% between 2010 and 2020 while the white population decreased 10.7%, the recall effort eked out by just a couple of percentage points.\nThe tight margins were significant \u2013 a signal that \u201ca new generation of young, Latinx folks are increasingly shifting politics in California\u201d, said Alicia Olivarez, the narrative and policy director for PowerCA Action.\nMeanwhile, in reliably Democratic counties like Los Angeles and San Francisco, 84% and 82% of Latino voters rejected the recall, according to the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Initiative.\nLatino voters\u2019 decisive role in the recall results show that ahead of the 2022 midterms, candidates in the state would do well to center Latinos in future campaigns rather than treating them as an afterthought, organizers said.\n\u201cLatino voters are not a monolith, but at least in the west, in California, it\u2019s Latino voters who have essentially helped turned a red state \u2013 the state that gave us Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan \u2013 into a blue one,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, the PowerCA Action director.\nAnd while some early analysis suggested that Latino voters may have sided with Democrats at a slightly lower percentage this year than in past elections, triggering debates about whether Republicans can make inroads, Cortes of Chispa said that such discussions are beside the point.\n\u201cOf course, there are varying political opinions between Latinos in LA and in Orange county, in rural and urban California, between younger and older people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut ultimately what matters is whether there\u2019s an actual, substantial investment in connecting with and listening to voters,\u201d he said.\nAlthough they turned out in higher numbers to vote in the recall than in previous special elections, Latinos remain underrepresented among California voters, said Mindy Romero, founder of the Center for Inclusive Democracy, a non-partisan research organization.\n\u201cJust think what more outreach could accomplish,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from this recall for Newsom it\u2019s that there\u2019s a real opportunity here to make a better relationship and better connection with the voters.\u201d",

Clayton Oliver was also influential seized control of a see-sawing contest.\n\u201cIt feels like a dream,\u201d Petracca told Seven. \u201cWe set out in the off-season to get this club back to where we should belong ... we bloody did it.\u201d\nIt is Melbourne\u2019s first premiership since 1964 and 13th overall, drawing them level with Richmond and Hawthorn in equal-fourth position \u2013 three flags behind leaders Carlton and Essendon (16 each).\nFor Luke Beveridge\u2019s Bulldogs, it ended hopes of replicating their 2016 flag.\nThe Demons led in the first quarter before the Bulldogs hit the front in the second. Led by captain Marcus Bontempelli and Adam Treloar, the Dogs fought back to hold an eight-point half-time lead and extended the buffer to 19 points midway through the third term.\nBut Simon Goodwin\u2019s side responded with seven unanswered goals, including four majors direct from centre bounces, in a 15-minute burst of dominance before the final change to build what would become an unassailable lead.\nThere was a sour note, with the majority of the Demons\u2019 legion of fans stuck in Melbourne\u2019s latest Covid-19 lockdown and unable to witness the momentous triumph in the flesh.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d captain Max Gawn said. \u201cMy heart goes out to everyone in the eastern states that are at home watching this, we did it for you.\u201d\nWatching on television, those fans saw a cautious start from both sides before Petracca\u2019s booming goal from 50 metres gave Melbourne a spark. Their pressure strangled the Bulldogs\u2019 ball movement and two goals to Fritsch helped fire the Demons into a 21-point lead by the first change.\nMelbourne\u2019s Ben Brown complemented Fritsch in attack with three goals and fellow key forward Tom McDonald finished with two, completing the rout with a set shot after the siren.\nGawn and tough midfielder Jack Viney were valuable contributors in the engine room, while All Australian duo Jake Lever and Steven May stood tall in defence.\nThe long-awaited flag means Melbourne can finally lay claim to having buried the infamous curse of Norm Smith. Smith, who led the Demons\u2019 last VFL premiership, was sacked as coach in controversial circumstances the following year and the club spiralled out of control for decades.",

It\u2019s been a tough year for us as a club.\n\u201cToday is the first game for our first team, they\u2019re playing their first league game since he died, and we\u2019re determined it\u2019s going to be a celebration.\n\u201cMatt would be delighted about today.

Others directed anger at politicians\nCarmelita was still trying to understand why so many migrants were allowed into Del Rio, Texas, where they camped in squalor under a bridge near her home.\n\u201cI felt terrified,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were, like, a lot of nights where I could not sleep.\u201d\nShe and her friend Kimberly, both 16, were studying for school outside Starbucks, minutes from the Mexico border. They had been living on the margins of a humanitarian emergency for days, since thousands of migrants and asylum seekers trudged across the Rio Grande River and established a sprawling encampment at the edge of Del Rio.\nIn what felt like a war zone, both teenagers learned to fear the desperate refugees who fled to their city. When Carmelita took the trash out, her mom watched to make sure she stayed safe. Kimberly\u2019s dad did not want her to be alone in a parking lot anymore, worried migrants might \u201cget\u201d her.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not clean people \u2013 not saying that in a bad way,\u201d Kimberly said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say animals, either \u2026 they\u2019re a different breed, in my opinion.\u201d\nAfter as many as 15,000 migrants, many of them Black Haitians, set up camp under Del Rio\u2019s International Bridge to await processing by immigration officials, the city\u2019s residents were thrust under a worldwide microscope. Their border closed, choking off business. Outsiders descended on the town.\nTensions flared as the overwhelmed community cratered along deep social and economic fault lines, laid bare over the last few days. On Thursday, an aggressive heckler shut down the Rev Al Sharpton as the African American civil rights leader tried to give a press conference after a tour of the camp.\n\u201cDel Rio is a loving, caring community. We don\u2019t want your racism in Texas. Get outta here,\u201d the protester screamed. \u201cNobody wants to hear your racist nonsense in Del Rio. You\u2019re a racist!\u201d\nThe small, poor city of roughly 36,000 sits deep in the heart of west Texas. It is a dusty town, filled with restaurant chains and budget hotels. The hot air buzzes with Spanish and English. People cross the International Bridge every day, on their morning commute.\nMuch like other areas along the Texas-Mexico border, the vast majority of residents are Hispanic or Latino. But unlike larger border communities \u2013 for instance, the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Democratic strongholds \u2013 voters around Del Rio went for Donald Trump in 2020.\nSome locals responded to the migrants with hate. Others directed anger at politicians. Others channeled a cool ambivalence to it all.\nAmid the chaos, one thing felt certain: the city became a raw and wounded flashpoint for the loaded immigration debate.\n\u201cThey\u2019re letting these people in, knowing very well that later on, down the line, they\u2019re gonna vote for, you know, the Democratic party,\u201d Kimberly said.\nAt Alberto\u2019s Auto Sales, the secretary, Rosalinda Reynosa, said she didn\u2019t have anything against the migrants. But without normal traffic between Mexico and Del Rio, the business \u2013 which sits just off the port of entry \u2013 was completely empty.\n\u201cNobody has come in. Nobody,\u201d she said.\nReynosa lives in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, across the border, but she was staying with her daughter in Del Rio during the bridge closure.\n\u201cThey\u2019re only seeing their benefit,\u201d Reynosa said of the migrants. \u201cBut what about us? What about us? We work for it.\u201d\nTracy Lawson zoomed up near the bridge on his motorcycle, after driving two and half hours from San Angelo, Texas. He was upset that his tax dollars were being spent on all this, but he at least hoped law enforcement would deter people from coming unlawfully.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to bring a bunch of outsiders in that don\u2019t know our way of life, that don\u2019t know our language,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThat are not citizens of this country.\u201d\nHe and his buddies could not trust the news any more, he said. So they were seeing the situation for themselves, before grabbing a bite and heading off to report back to friends and family.\nIn front of them lay the rotting carcass of a crisis, a desolate landscape guarded by gates and fences. Any last stragglers at the bridge encampment had been moved, and the clean-up operation was too blocked off to see much at all.\nWhat lingered was a ghostly feeling, the manifestation of a \u201claw and order\u201d state still teeming with security personnel. Their vehicles monopolized the roads in and around Del Rio, as if they ruled the town.\nTo some, their presence was comforting. Kimberly saw exhausted law enforcement agents at her job, in a fast-food restaurant, and she always thanked them. Del Rio\u2019s Democratic mayor, Bruno Lozano, depicted such agents as lifesavers and heroes, providing medical treatment or giving food and water to migrants in need.\n\u201cI was trying to prevent mass casualty, and I believe that the border patrol working alongside CBP [US Customs and Border Protection], the county, the state and my offices have all prevented that from happening,\u201d Lozano said.\nYet that narrative was complicated by viral images of agents on horseback aggressively confronting Black migrants. After the photos caused widespread horror, border patrol stopped using horses to police migrants in Del Rio.\nAt a local shopping center, Juan Jos\u00e9 Lechuga said he wasn\u2019t personally bothered by his city\u2019s pervasive security. But he was worried about how the migrants were being treated and blamed both the state and federal governments for mismanaging the situation.\nHe didn\u2019t blame the migrants. They just had needs, he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who suffer,\u201d Lechuga said, \u201cbecause they come from very far away, and they crash into a reality that wasn\u2019t what they were hoping for. And that is pretty serious.\u201d",

One of the sport\u2019s greatest of all time, Marianne Vos, finished in tears, less than a bike length behind after a gruelling 157km around Flanders.\nBalsamo, the 2016 world junior champion, and the rest of the Italian team played a tactical blinder by lying low in the final 50km before the finish in Leuven as the Dutch squandered their strength in a constant series of fruitless moves \u2013 and other nations squandered theirs with constant responses \u2013 as the peloton was whittled down to a front group of about 25.\nThe 23-year-old from Piedmont and two of her teammates moved to the front in the final kilometre, with Vos perfectly positioned in their slipstream as Balsamo opened up the finish sprint. Vos\u2019s sprint has secured two one-day Classic wins this year, but the 2012 Olympic champion was unable to find her final kick and ended up just under a bike length shy of her fourth world road title. A sixth silver road race medal was scant consolation.\n\u201cMy teammates gave me the perfect lead out,\u201d said Balsamo, who ended a Dutch monopoly on the title that lasts back to 2017. \u201cAfter the last corner I switched off my brain and just said I had to go full gas.\u201d\nPoland\u2019s Katarzyna Niewiadoma took the bronze medal behind Vos, who could reflect on a day when her Dutch teammates had attacked tirelessly in the final hour, placing seven riders in the final selection, and with the 2019 champion, Annemiek van Vleuten, in particular stretching the survivors with one searing acceleration after another.\nOn a day of contrasting fortunes for Great Britain, Lizzie Deignan struggled with the attritional nature of the course. She finished 14th after being unable to figure in the finish sprint having fought her way back to the front after being on the wrong side of a split on the penultimate lap.\n\u201cI felt completely out of speed,\u201d said the 2015 world champion. \u201cIt was a war of attrition, just stressful the whole day.\u201d\nDeignan hailed one of the strongest Great Britain performances she has seen in many years, with Pfeiffer Georgi and Anna Henderson at her side until almost the close, with Henderson working herself into the ground to neutralise most of the attacks from Vos\u2019s teammates.\nAt 20 and 22 respectively, Georgi and Henderson offered a glimpse of the future, and there was another when the Welsh rider Zoe B\u00e4ckstedt gave Britain their first gold medal of this year\u2019s championships with a dominant victory in the women\u2019s junior title race, outsprinting the American Kaia Schmid after five laps of the 15-kilometre circuit in Leuven.\nB\u00e4ckstedt had already taken the silver medal in the time trial and went one better after attacking with Schmid on the third time up the narrow, partly cobbled Sint-Antoniusberg climb.\nThey rapidly built a one-minute advantage \u2013 helped by a crash in the remnants of the chasing pack \u2013 after which the destiny of the gold and silver medals was clear and it remained only for B\u00e4ckstedt to outsprint her breakaway partner.\nThe 17-year-old from Pontypridd comes from one of Britain\u2019s most remarkable cycling families. Her elder sister Elynor landed two bronze medals in the junior races in 2018 and 2019 and now rides with Deignan\u2019s Trek-Segafredo professional team, while their mother, Megan (n\u00e9e Hughes), is a former British road race champion and her father, Magnus, won the Paris-Roubaix one-day Classic in 2004.\n\u201cI think I had a slow puncture for the whole race,\u201d said B\u00e4ckstedt. \u201cI could feel at one point that it was a little bit flat, but from cyclo-cross I know I can ride a tyre that\u2019s got a bit less air in \u2013 I just have to be a bit more careful on the corners.\n\u201cI knew if I could get into the last corner first, I could take it at my speed and she wouldn\u2019t be able to get away from me, so I took it first and took it up to a sprint and it worked out perfectly.\u201d",

        "content": "Amazing the confidence a title can bestow. Harlequins continued the defence of their unexpected crown with another bonus-point win. The champions racked up five tries comfortably, if never quite reprising the rugby with which they astonished the Premiership at the end of last season.\nPlenty to work on, too. The concession of tries has never seemed to bother Quins, which is just as well as Worcester scored four of them. \u201cIn the first half, we felt we had the game under control,\u201d said Tabai Matson, Quins\u2019 new senior coach. \u201cBut they made it really difficult. The penalty count was well in our favour, and we didn\u2019t put them away.\u201d\nThe Warriors claimed two bonus points towards the close, their fourth try bringing them to within six points. It did not quite flatter them, but neither did Worcester ever suggest they might catch up, albeit they did pull to within four points just past the hour, after two quick tries.\nUntil that point, Quins had been comfortable. As befits homecoming champions, the Stoop was at capacity, depleted only by the odd carload lost to Saturday afternoon traffic. If they had come in expectation of the kind of otherworldly rugby by which Quins had prevailed at the sharp end of last season, they were to be disappointed by the execution, if not by the ambition.\nThe penalty count favoured Quins three to one, but not one was aimed at the posts. This was not only the champions\u2019 first home game of the season, it was, more memorably, the first Premiership match refereed by a woman. Sara Cox looked comfortable, lecturing front-row forwards confidently about their scrummaging technique, and much else besides. She definitely preferred Quins\u2019 attitude, though, awarding them 18 consecutive penalties across the heart of the match.\nWorcester\u2019s early initiative was rewarded with three consecutive penalties in the first five minutes, the first landed by Owen Williams for an early lead, the third missed. Then Quins took over, and the next 18 penalties were theirs, nine of them in the first half.\nDanny Care buzzed around, tapping here, tapping there, his initiative paving the way for two of the three first-half tries that accounted for Quins\u2019 21-3 lead at the break. He tapped one in the 17th minute, and the mountainous Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen proved as adept at finding space as he is at smashing his way through when he found Louis Lynagh with a long pass. The latest England callup showed he could mix it physically too, crashing through three tacklers to the line.\nQuins had their second off an advancing scrum, which they\u2019d called at another penalty right in front, Alex Dombrandt finishing. Their third followed a yellow card for Noah Heward, Worcester\u2019s wing. His absence gave Cadan Murley an easy run-in on the stroke of half-time. Tommy Allan landed all three conversions, the first and third from the touchline.\nWorcester arrested the flow of tries, at least, shortly after the break. After an attacking lineout, Ollie Lawrence picked a line off Williams for the Warriors\u2019 first. They may not be Harlequins, but after the Season of the Comeback no one was ruling anything out at that stage.\nYet still the penalties flowed Quins\u2019 way. From the 14th consecutive decision in their favour, Care tapped again, and Luke Northmore put Joe Marchant over for their bonus-point try in the corner, again converted.\nWorcester would not lie down. Still no penalties, but a scrum at least was awarded in their favour, just before the hour. Williams chipped into acres of space, and Willi Heinz was the first on to it. Four minutes later, Jamie Shillcock\u2019s elegant break paved the way for Heinz\u2019s replacement, Will Chudley, to run in the Warriors\u2019 third try. Suddenly, the deficit was only four points.\nSurely not? No. Harlequins sent Marchant down the left. He was stopped, for the concession of an 18th consecutive penalty, which like so many of the others was tapped. Seconds later, Dino Lamb burrowed over for Quins\u2019 fifth try.\nLet the record state that Worcester were awarded their fourth penalty in the 77th minute and their fifth and sixth followed shortly. From the lineout following the sixth, Billy Searle broke to the line, where Marc Thomas squeezed over for those two bonus points. The Warriors seemed happy with that. Everyone on the field took the time to congratulate Cox, as did the coaching staff of both teams. There will be sterner challenges ahead for her, and hopefully still higher-profile ones \u2013 as there will be for both sets of players.",

        "content": "In a match between two rigorously drilled systems, Manchester City\u2019s \u00a3100m man provided a vital element of maverick flair\nThere were four minutes to play as Jack Grealish left the pitch. Manchester City were still deep in the boiler room, seeing out a 1-0 lead in a game they had for long periods dominated to a strangulating degree. But there was time still for a round of hand-clasps, back-pats and buttock slaps, the most significant from his replacement Raheem Sterling, who had sat for 85 minutes watching Grealish produce a quiet masterpiece on the flank that had been Sterling\u2019s own private strip of turf for long periods last season.\nThere was nothing from Pep Guardiola, although Grealish did sneak an eager, lingering look at the maniacal figure in black, who was at that moment caught up with whirling his arms and barking out assorted thoughts, ideas, tweaks, fears, counter-theories.\nThe debrief will come later. But Grealish knew he\u2019d been good here, romping about like a handsome 1930s public schoolboy, brain whizzing, calves popping with balletic power, always looking for a moment, a sliver of space.\nCity signed Grealish to offer a tangible point of difference and it is a fine state of affairs when a club can afford to spend \u00a3100m on marginal gains, altered angles, a grace note that makes the piece. But that is exactly what Grealish gave at Stamford Bridge with a performance of fearless, toe-to-toe attacking drive in his first Premier League game of this scale.\nThat influence was there in the winning goal on 53 minutes. Gabriel Jesus, the scorer, will take the headlines. Rightly so: he had a wonderful game. His goal came from City\u2019s 10th corner, most of them forced on Grealish\u2019s flank. This is no great surprise. There is a kind of cruelty in Grealish\u2019s game, in the way he stands up against a defender in those positions, daring them to blink, to let their concentration drop. He really must be exhausting to play against.\nKevin De Bruyne took the kick. The ball was headed up in the air. Finally it fell to Jesus, who was able to turn and shoot low past \u00c9douard Mendy.\nIt felt like an inevitability. City had dominated this game to a bizarre degree, with 67% possession at that point and 400 passes to the home team\u2019s 200. No matter how expert, how suffocating your lines of defence, eventually some football is going to happen out there\nMoments later Grealish almost made it two. Again he simply stood right up close to C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and asked him to dance, dipping one way, sneaking the other and letting off a high-technique stubbed shot, the football equivalent of the one-inch punch, that was deflected just past the far post.\nThis is what Grealish is for at City. Head up, shoulders squared, mane flapping like a dressage horse, he also lost the ball four times in the opening hour, slowed the play, took an extra touch \u2013 but always offered a vital random element to what was for long periods a suffocating game of systems football.\nFor all the sense of some sky blue machine in action, the same set of ideas relentlessly revolved, Guardiola also has a liking for sparks of difference. Riyad Mahrez offers this too. And here Grealish even added some old-fashioned needle, squaring up to Azpilicueta and, judging by the body language, suggesting a personal rendezvous a little later behind the medical centre.\nStamford Bridge had been a boisterous place at kick-off, as Guardiola began the afternoon with a 5D-chess move, putting out what was on paper a pretty orthodox starting XI, featuring a genuine holding midfielder in Rodri and normal-ish centre forward in Jesus.\nExcept, of course, there was a twist \u2013 cut to Pep in crumpled rain mac, turning in the doorway, and just, one last thing \u2013 with Phil Foden acting as the central striker and Jesus on the right.\nThomas Tuchel responded with a selection containing five defenders, two defensive midfielders, and only two footballers who might reasonably be expected to score a goal, one of whom, with all due respect, was Timo Werner. And this was how the game played out in the opening minutes, as City enjoyed something close to total control.\nTuchel could be seen leaping up on his touchline throughout the half, urging his midfield to play higher up the pitch. But Chelsea remained a constricted presence, the footballing equivalent of a man with something stuck in his throat still gamely trying to deliver his keynote speech.\nThrough all this Bernardo Silva had a wonderful, ferreting game in central midfield, showing again what a brilliantly versatile player he is and working well in tandem with De Bruyne. The beauty of Grealish in this mix is he also does De Bruyne things, taking a little of that creative, tempo-setting burden.\nThere was link-up between the two here, and a sense of a pooled playmaking sense. It will be fascinating to see how Guardiola tinkers with this \u2013 and he will refuse to see a player of Grealish\u2019s quality as settled on one flank. Central Grealish, false nine Grealish, wandering Grealish: this will all surely come. Here his boldness on the left was a fine blend with the bustle of Jesus and a vital point of difference throughout.",

Chelsea were outplayed and Guardiola, who surpassed Les McDowall\u2019s record of 220 wins as City manager, feels that his side have more to give.\n\u201cI would say this season,\u201d he said after being asked if it was City\u2019s best display in the last six months. \u201cIn the last months we have done many good games, otherwise you cannot win the Premier League and be runners up in the Champions League. It\u2019s incredible what these players have done. People say the Champions League was a disaster. We played 13 games, won 11, drew one and lost one. When this happens it is exceptional, that helps us and now we go to Paris to play. I have the feeling the players are there and want to do another good season.\u201d\nGuardiola was happy with Jesus after the Brazilian scored the only goal. \u201cGabriel is one person or player who deserves the very best,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who runs and works for everyone, and every time he scores I\u2019m the happiest man. He can play up front in all three positions and he does them all very well.\n\u201cWe know from the past how aggressive Chelsea are in the duels. But you have to handle that at this level.

And that\u2019s why he\u2019s one of the best signings we have made in this period together at City.\u201d\nTuchel admitted that Chelsea, who visit Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, were second best. \u201cWe lost the game and I think City deserved to win,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cUntil the goal, we were very, very strong in the last 20m of the field, but only there, unfortunately, and there are another 80m left where we were not good enough today to escape pressure, to have ball possession - and not only ball possession to breathe, but ball possession to switch play, to hurt them and to grow in confidence. We were not on our very best level, and you need your very best level to push a game like this to your side.\u201d",

That held open a seat eventually filled by Neil Gorsuch, the first of three conservatives installed under Donald Trump.\n\u201cCross those bridges when I get there, we are focusing on 22,\u201d McConnell told Politico, referring to the midterm elections in a variation on a theme with which he has already infuriated liberals, saying it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he would let Biden confirm a justice in 2024, the year of the next presidential contest.\n\u201cI don\u2019t rule anything in or out about how to handle nominations if I\u2019m in the majority position,\u201d McConnell said.\nThe Kentucky senator was in the majority position in September 2020, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal lion, died less than two months before a presidential election.\nIgnoring his claim in the case of Garland that no justice should be installed in an election year, McConnell oversaw the swift confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett on a 52-48 vote, the first in modern times with no support from the minority party.\nThat split the court 6-3 in favour of conservatives. Public approval of the court has since dipped, polling shows, particularly after cases like one from Texas this month in which the court refused to block a ban on abortions early in pregnancy and provisions to allow private citizens to benefit financially from suing anyone involved.\nThat majority was made up of the three Trump justices and two other conservatives, with the three liberals and Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by a Republican, George W Bush, in dissent.\nMajor decisions on immigration and evictions have also gone conservatives\u2019 way. Abortion, gun and religious rights are all on the docket. To many, the court faces the most serious threat to its legitimacy since its decision settled the 2000 presidential election in Bush\u2019s favour.\n\u201cI think we may have come to a turning point,\u201d Irv Gornstein, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Supreme Court Institute, told the Associated Press.\n\u201cIf within a span of a few terms we see sweeping right-side decisions over left-side dissents on every one of the most politically divisive issues of our time \u2013 voting, guns, abortion, religion, affirmative action \u2013 perception of the court may be permanently altered.\u201d\nPaul Smith, a lawyer who has argued before the court in support of LGBTQ+ and voting rights and other issues, told the AP people were increasingly upset that the \u201ccourt is way to the right of the American people on a lot of issues\u201d.\nBut proposals for reform, perhaps by adding justices to a panel not constitutionally bound to be nine-strong, are reliably controversial. Some experts against structural reform argue that views of the court have dipped and rebounded before.\nRoman Martinez, a lawyer who regularly argues before the court, told the AP \u201ca sustained campaign to delegitimise the court \u2026 has gotten some traction on the left\u201d.\nTom Goldstein, founder of the Scotusblog website who argues before the court, said the court \u201chas built up an enormous font of public respect, no matter what it does\u201d.\nBut the justices are evidently aware of a problem at least of public perception. Three \u2013 Barrett and Clarence Thomas from the right, Stephen Breyer from the left \u2013 have recently claimed not to rule according to political beliefs.\nBreyer, at 83 the oldest member of the court, is the subject of calls to retire so Biden can confirm a replacement while Democrats hold the Senate. Breyer has said he does not intend to die on the court, as Ginsburg did, but has refused to be drawn on when he might step down.\nIn Louisville, Kentucky, meanwhile, Barrett recently told an audience: \u201cMy goal today is to convince you that this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks.\u201d\nShe was speaking next to McConnell, at a center named in his honour.",

This is a major achievement,\u201d said one frontbencher.\nBut there was widespread dismay in all wings of the party over the way Labour had been plunged into more divisive internal arguments just at the point when it had hoped to train its guns on the Tories and present its leader as a future occupant of No 10.\nIn an excoriating article in the Observer, the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he can no longer play the loyal elder statesman.\nHe says Starmer \u201chas abandoned the platform on which he was elected Labour leader, sidelined much of the broad team that got him elected and has reached for the Blairite playbook and resuscitated Blair\u2019s old crew, of Peter Mandelson as his consigliere, combined with an appetite for factional purges that makes the Kinnock era look tame. The result is that we are witnessing something akin to the performance of a Blairite tribute band with the same old stunts and strategies being rolled out on schedule but with a great deal more venom.\u201d\nStarmer and the shadow cabinet are still hopeful they can rescue the conference with a series of major announcements on job security, green policies and education, among others, in the coming days. The Labour leader is also determined to turn up the volume of criticism of the Tories over lorry driver and fuel shortages as well as the looming cost-of-living crisis.\nStarmer told the Observer he was demanding emergency visas for haulage drivers to get supplies up and running fast. \u201cLabour also demands cancelling the cut to universal credit and scrapping the tax hike on national insurance. Both make a bad situation much worse for working people.\n\u201cFinally, let\u2019s end short-term panic with a plan to address labour shortages by boosting working conditions and British industry so we buy, make and sell more in this country, building a stronger future together.\u201d\nEd Miliband will on Sunday push ahead with ambitious Biden-style plans for investment in greener industry, including the steel industry, under the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d. Miliband said it is no time to be cautious. \u201cWe have to go big on green because it is the only route to delivering economic and climate justice together, and it is the only way to tackle the greatest threat to humanity,\u201d said the former party leader and shadow business minister.\nBut anger at Starmer\u2019s misjudgment over the leadership rule changes has seriously dented morale, even among shadow ministers who see themselves as scrupulously loyal. \u201cThis is a total disaster,\u201d one member of the frontbench said.\nUnder Starmer\u2019s original proposal to change the rules on electing leaders, the one-member, one-vote system would have been replaced with a return to the electoral college made up of the unions and affiliate organisations, MPs and party members \u2013 each with an equal share. Even party moderates said the plan \u2013 designed to make it more difficult for the leftwing membership to elect a leader such as Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 was a difficult sell as it appeared to send a message that the party did not trust its members.\nDelegates were due on Saturday night to vote on a revised package under which candidates for leadership elections would have to have the support of 20% of MPs, up from the current 10%.\nOther conference flashpoints for the leader could include rows over Labour\u2019s position on trans rights and changes mandated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission after its investigation into antisemitism.\nStarmer also faced criticism from his predecessor. Speaking at a Young Labour rally, Jeremy Corbyn suggested the left could organise against Starmer: \u201cThe electoral college plan may have been defeated for now but we have seen the leadership\u2019s true colours.\n\u201cIf we want the Labour party to be a vehicle to win elections to confront the climate emergency and redistribute wealth and power to the many from the few, then we need to come together and get organised.\n\u201cThere is another way forward, for the Labour party and Britain, that is based in peace and justice, in the policies the majority of people actually want, not what the establishment and its media mouthpieces insist they should want. If our leadership won\u2019t champion that path, our movement must and will.\u201d",

        "content": "Tottenham play mid-table football in a shiny new stadium and fail to bridge the gulf to the rich elite \u2013 just like their derby rivals\nThe phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached Spurs. It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing visible save one outstretched hand. It pointed to the south-west and in that moment Spurs understood. Spurs looked at Arsenal and saw not a rival but their own future. Could it be that Arsenal are a vision of Tottenham yet to come?\nThis is a tale of Daniel Levy, of course, and of Mauricio Pochettino and Harry Kane and dozens of others, but it is also about the broader sweep of history. Football, as we know it today, may have been born in London with the formulation of the Football Association at the Freemasons Arms near Covent Garden in 1863 and the codification of the laws that still form the basis of the modern game, but after professionalisation it quickly left.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1931 that a London club first won the league. Football became a game dominated by the large industrial cities of the north and Midlands, a pattern followed in most large democracies. That was where the biggest crowds were and where a sense of provincial pride encouraged local industrialists to invest.\nThere were moments of excellence for Arsenal and Tottenham, even Chelsea, but it was only in the 80s with the decline of the industrial heartlands and an increasing focus of capital on the capital that London came to match Liverpool and Manchester as a great centre of English football. It is the only British city to have provided three different Champions League finalists.\nBut while London offers certain advantages \u2013 a large fanbase, a cosmopolitan environment attractive to foreign players and managers, vast commercial and marketing opportunities \u2013 it is also expensive. Arsenal decided in 1997 that they had to move from Highbury, a beautiful and historic ground that had come to feel cramped and was impractical for the modern world of media and corporate hospitality. When they eventually moved into the Emirates in 2006, the cost was \u00a3390m. They have never recovered.\nThat\u2019s not to say it was the wrong decision to move; on the contrary, it was the only decision that the club could have made if they wanted to compete with Manchester United. But by the time Arsenal had moved a number of small things had changed, and so had one big one.\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger had arrived as a visionary. But by 2006, other clubs had caught up with his advances in nutrition and his understanding of overseas transfer markets. By the end of the decade, there was a clear sense that he was no longer in the tactical vanguard. But worse was the financial reality. Between Arsenal buying the land at Ashburton Grove and completing the stadium, Roman Abramovich had taken over Chelsea and football\u2019s economics had changed absolutely. Two years after Arsenal moved in to the Emirates, Sheikh Mansour bought Manchester City.\nThat apparently inexorable shift of footballing power to the capital suddenly was disrupted by far greater outside forces. It didn\u2019t matter whether Arsenal trebled or quadrupled their gate receipts, they could never hope to compete with the wealth of an oligarch or an emirate. And so, as Chelsea and City rose, Arsenal, operating under budgetary restraints as they paid back the loan for the stadium, slid.\nWenger probably stayed on too long. Bad decisions have been made. Transfers have been mystifying at times. But a lot of the mistakes have been at least partially provoked by circumstance. Would they have made the same expensive signings, would they have granted the same vast contracts to ageing stars, had they not been deeply insecure about their waning status?\nOf course the club has been poorly run, but it\u2019s no coincidence that Ivan Gazidis, Sven Mislintat and Unai Emery, seen as failures at the Emirates, have all been successful after leaving. For Arsenal not to have declined at least to an extent would have required something approaching genius.\nLike Arsenal, Tottenham moved into a sparkling new stadium in the same year that they reached their only Champions League final. Like Arsenal, they have found their budget restricted as a result, their difficulties amplified by the pandemic (it may be the apogee of \u201cSpursiness\u201d to construct a new stadium at vast expense to increase revenues and almost immediately be forced to lock fans out).\nThey too had their crisis with an extremely popular manager who had transformed perceptions of the club. Backing Pochettino, which would have involved selling players he felt had gone stale as well as releasing funds for signings, was the difficult option. Levy\u2019s great mistake was, at that moment, to abandon the careful husbandry that had previously characterised his approach and instead cosplay being a big club by sacking him and appointing a celebrity manager in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\nIf Kane starts scoring in the league again, Levy\u2019s intransigence over his sale to City may seem vindicated, but there is also a danger that keeping him is the equivalent of Arsenal offering Mesut \u00d6zil or Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang an expensive extended contract: a club uncomfortable about how others view them clinging on to the star who offers status rather than having the confidence to find replacements still on the way up.\nPerhaps Arsenal, with their new focus on youth, will build again. They have finished the past two seasons strongly under Mikel Arteta and that perhaps offers some succour amid the gloom. But what does that mean? How high can they go? Champions League qualification? Europa League? A Premier League challenge seems a very long way off.\nFor Tottenham, that is a warning. Their Champions League final may be only two years in the past but they must look at Arsenal and see a worrying glimpse of a potential future: a club with Super League aspirations in a magnificent stadium in a well-appointed part of the country, playing mid-table football and unable to climb higher because of the vast gulf between them and the next tier of the sport\u2019s financial hierarchy.",

        "content": "More than a decade after a parliamentary inquiry promised to overhaul the management of early pregnancy complications, underfunding, understaffing and insensitivity continue to fail women in their darkest hour\nFourteen years ago, Jana Horska had a miscarriage in a toilet at Sydney\u2019s Royal North Shore hospital after waiting for hours, in pain, with no assistance or information from staff.\nShe was 14 weeks pregnant.\nThe horror of Horska\u2019s experience led to a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry that made a number of recommendations around miscarriage care, including the establishment and monitoring of Early Pregnancy Assessment Services (Epas) in public hospitals across the state.\nBut more than a decade later, NSW Health has batted away questions about how those services are functioning, overseen, staffed and whether they are meeting best practice guidelines.\nAustralia doesn\u2019t gather miscarriage data, but early pregnancy loss is thought to affect between 102,000 and 150,000 families a year. Somewhere between 35,000 and 74,000 patients are admitted to hospital for treatment across the country.\nMultiple obstetricians have told Guardian Australia that while some Epas units provide exceptional care, especially those in large tertiary hospitals, not all are operating as they should \u2013 particularly in regional areas.\nHorska is calling on NSW Health to show transparency around measures that were put in place around early pregnancy loss following the inquiry sparked by her experience.\nHorska still thinks regularly about what happened to her that night in 2007. She now wrestles with how much of the detail to share with her living children, especially her oldest, a 12-year-old daughter.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t tend to ask you questions when you\u2019re ready for it. Sometimes it\u2019s quite difficult to go back to and I\u2019m not ready to talk about it,\u201d she explains.\nHorska had already had one miscarriage when she started to experience bleeding and cramping during her second pregnancy. In a panic, she called her previous obstetrician back in Slovakia.\n\u201cHe told me just go to the hospital, they\u2019ll put you on a drip and bedrest and you will see what happens. I went to the hospital and the first thing I remember is that there weren\u2019t many people in the waiting area and I thought that was a good sign.\u201d\nHorska filled out the forms and waited. And waited. And waited.\n\u201cI was just getting more and more pain. I was having contractions, but I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was. Eventually, a nurse came and asked me if I had a pad on. I said yes, I did. They took my temperature.\u201d\nHorska then went from sitting on a chair to squatting on the ground as the pain became overwhelming. Between contractions, she went to the toilet.\n\u201cWhen I got there, I sat down and I had this urge to push. I just couldn\u2019t help it. And then the baby just fell in my hands. I was in such a state of shock. I grabbed the wet floor signs from in front of me and I just smashed it against the window and I started yelling out for my husband.\u201d\nHorska was moved immediately in a wheelchair from the toilets to a bed, her son in between her legs. Still in shock and still waiting for a specialist to see her and explain what had happened, she was told by a nurse: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my mother\u2019s had heaps of miscarriages.\u201d\nHorska\u2019s story was leaked to the press and outrage ensued along with a wave of further complaints about treatment at Royal North Shore hospital, which was underfunded and stretched to breaking point.\nHorska, along with her husband, testified at the parliamentary inquiry, which also heard from another patient, who experienced a similar lack of care, sympathy or understanding from emergency department staff.\nHaving miscarried before, that patient knew the loss was imminent, and demanded a seat inside the department itself so she did not have to miscarry her baby in \u201ca room full of strangers\u201d in the waiting area. She ended up miscarrying her baby into a toilet at 14 weeks \u2013 just like Horska.\nOne of the key recommendations of the inquiry was the establishment of Epas units, which were to be reported on in the NSW Health annual report.\nCommentary around the recommendations at the time of the inquiry and since acknowledge Epas units would not address all the issues relating to early pregnancy loss in the hospital system, but they were a solid start.\nThere was also hope that the Epas units would encourage communication between emergency physicians and people with specialist understanding of miscarriage and related trauma.\nThe health minister at the time, Reba Meagher, undertook to spend $4.5m in the 2007/08 financial year to implement the report\u2019s recommendations.\n\u201cWomen with early pregnancy problems who present to an emergency department but do not need urgent medical attention will get rapid assessment and advice from new early pregnancy units, co-located within most emergency departments,\u201d she said at the time.\nThe 2007/08 NSW Health annual report did report back on Epas units \u2013 in three paragraphs. It noted that new Epas units had taken the total number in NSW to 22, but there was no information about capacity, benchmarked standards of care or oversight. At the time, NSW had 228 public hospitals, of which 124 were major, large, medium or acute.\nBy 2009/10 and 2010/11 reporting had morphed into updates about general antenatal care offerings, and by 2011/12 there was no mention of early pregnancy care at all.\nEarlier this year, Hannah* attended a hospital emergency department in Sydney after repeatedly calling the hospital\u2019s Epas with no response.\n\u201cSo we went to the emergency department, they gave me the painkillers and said call the clinic again [because] \u2018they\u2019re the ones that know what they\u2019re doing\u2019,\u201d she says.\nFinally, after again calling repeatedly, Hannah got a call back from the clinic.\n\u201c[The nurse from the Epas] was like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m having all of this pain.\u2019 Basically, what I wanted to ask her was, if my husband leaves the house, is he going to come home and find me dead in the bathroom? That was where my brain was at because I\u2019d never experienced anything like that \u2026 And she said to me, \u2018Darling, it\u2019s just a miscarriage.\u2019\u201d\nAnother patient, Rose*, experienced a miscarriage earlier this year. After her GP in coastal NSW confirmed the loss via an ultrasound, he referred her to the local Epas, which took three days to get back to her.\n\u201cWhen I went into the Epas, I was in the waiting room and I was seeing pregnant women everywhere, which was kind of shit,\u201d she says.\nOnce Rose got into the clinic she says she \u201cbroke down\u201d, but the service was good.\n\u201cThe nurse was fantastic and so was the obstetrician,\u201d she explains.\nRose opted for a surgical procedure to end the pregnancy. Usually she would have to wait up to two weeks, but by luck they were able to fit her in two days later. This still meant a total 10-day wait from the first confirmation of the miscarriage to bringing the pregnancy to a close.\n\u201cI just wanted it done. Over. I just wanted to escape that period of my life and start grieving,\u201d she says.\nIn 2012, NSW Health issued guidelines for the \u201cmanagement of early pregnancy complications\u201d, which state that all maternity services must provide, or be networked to, a dedicated outpatient Epas, and that all Epas units should have an appointments system, a separate waiting area, an ultrasound machine (including transvaginal ultrasound) or access to these services, and easy access to laboratory facilities.\nIt further states that Epas should be available \u201con a daily basis during the normal working week and if possible, services available on weekends and after hours\u201d.\nBut even the Epas clinic located within Sydney\u2019s biggest hospital, Liverpool hospital in south-western Sydney, is only open 8am to 3pm, six days a week.\nOne obstetrician says their hospital in regional NSW does not provide a discrete waiting area, meaning like Rose, women attending with threatened miscarriage are often seated alongside heavily pregnant women.\n\u201cSome leave for that reason, or don\u2019t attend, therefore [don\u2019t receive] the care they needed,\u201d the doctor says.\n\u201cWe got an ultrasound machine and [NSW Health] is supposed to fund a midwife or nurse for four hours per day to be sitting there scanning and running the clinic,\u201d another obstetrician, who works in regional NSW hospitals, says.\n\u201cThe money for that nurse or midwife disappeared, so we have no nurse or midwife sitting in a clinic. Even though the funding was received, it\u2019s just gone somewhere else. The ultrasound machine sits in another department.\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a one-stop-shop. They can get the scans done, get the social worker, get everything done in one place. But [patients] basically just rock up to the consult room, they see a registrar \u2013 no nurse and a midwife, no social worker \u2013 [and] if they\u2019re lucky, they might get thrown a brochure.\u201d\nAnother NSW-based obstetrician says that while they have seen exceptional care at some clinics in the city, standards can vary markedly.\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s all about communication, what is happening and why. That\u2019s why I find it so frustrating, because I think that is the role that [Epas units] are supposed to fill, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the care is where it potentially could be.\u201d\nThe president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Dr Vijay Roach, says early pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, are profound experiences for many people.\n\u201cWe must ensure access to sensitive, skilled and timely assessment, and management, of those affected. The medical profession, health departments, and society as a whole, need to realise that these mothers, and their families, matter, and give them the care that they deserve.\u201d\nThe guidelines for management of early pregnancy complications were due to be updated in August 2021, representing a fresh opportunity to address some of the issues around care during miscarriage and early pregnancy loss. NSW Health told the Guardian the document \u201cremains current\u201d, and the review will begin early next year.\nIn response to questions about how many Epas units are operating in the state, how they are staffed, how many patients are seen and who oversees them, NSW Health said \u201cthat information is not available\u201d.\nIn a response to a list of follow-up questions about the issues raised in this story, NSW Health said Epas units were the responsibility of local health districts.\n\u201cEach Local Health District is responsible for managing and monitoring access to EPAS clinics. NSW Health does not provide a segregated budget for EPAS clinics. Local Health Districts are responsible for funding local EPAS provision within their overall budget allocation.\u201d",

        "content": "After living in plain sight in Sydney\u2019s northern beaches and working as a handyman, Darko Desic has turned himself in to police and faces court this week\nSix weeks before Darko \u201cDougie\u201d Desic handed himself in to Dee Why police, he shared his dilemma with one of the few mates he trusted in his adopted homeland. The 64-year-old had spent 29 years on the run after one of Australia\u2019s most audacious prison breaks.\nThe dilapidated house he called home \u2013 so rundown he and his fellow tenants placed an umbrella over the outside loo \u2013 had been sold as Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches property prices peaked in the pandemic, making Desic homeless.\nAfter three decades living in plain sight in the suburb of Avalon, Desic decided to confess to a mate. For understandable reasons, the unlikely priest taking his confession wishes to remain anonymous.\n\u201cTwo years ago, I invited Dougie for Christmas lunch,\u201d his mate says. \u201cI bought him a present, a new guitar. He\u2019d picked up an old one from the council clean-up and taught himself to play. So I bought him a proper one. Two weeks later he came back with a song he said he had written for me.\n\u201cDougie said he\u2019d never been invited for a Christmas or a birthday in 30 years. He also said this was the first present he\u2019d received since his father gave him a plastic Daffy Duck when he was a kid in Croatia.\u201d\nDarko Desic later revealed he\u2019d broken out of Grafton gaol in 1992, and had lived under the radar ever since.\nThe reason he walked or caught a bus to every job? Because he couldn\u2019t apply for a driving licence.\nWhy had he pulled out his own teeth with pliers? Because he\u2019d never been able to register for Medicare. Or Centrelink, a bank account, credit card, membership of the local RSL, passport or anything that entailed proof of identity and being a member of contemporary society.\n\u201cThe six weeks before Dougie handed himself in were terrible,\u201d says his mate, who offered him a spare room for a few weeks. \u201c\u2018Dougie, you\u2019re 64,\u2019 I said. \u2018We need to come up with a survival plan for you.\u2019\n\u201cBut Dougie replied: \u2018Mate, I\u2019ve done the crime, so I\u2019ll deal with it.\u2019 Over many cups of tea, he said, \u2018All I can do now is be honest. I\u2019ll hand myself into the police, but I don\u2019t want anyone getting into trouble for knowing me.\u201d\nDesic left his temporary accommodation to live in the hobo camps in the thick bushland above Avalon\u2019s sand dunes so as not to implicate his mate. Before he left, he practised staying in his room for hours on end.\n\u201cI need to get used to a small space again,\u201d he told his mate. \u201cI\u2019ve been there once and it\u2019s a hard thing to do.\u201d\nThe day before his surrender \u2013 Sunday 12 September \u2013 the mate said he\u2019d drive Desic to Dee Why police station.\n\u201cI offered to buy him a last meal of freedom, but I could see in his eyes his mind was made up.\n\u201cThere were a few tears when I dropped him off at the main Avalon bus stop. But he was insistent none of his friends should be blamed for his misdeeds.\u201d\nWhen Darko Desic appeared before Sydney\u2019s Central Criminal court from a police cell in Surry Hills on 14 September, his extraordinary secret life became headline news \u2013 not just in Australia but around the world.\nWhy did a fugitive who pulled off such a daring prison breakout and eluded recapture for three decades \u2013 living in one of Sydney\u2019s most picturesque and expensive suburbs \u2013 suddenly resolve to hand himself in?\nHis story seemed a parable of this global pandemic, Covid-19 claiming another victim. After 29 years of keeping his head down, moving from one cash-in-hand job to another, barely keeping above the poverty line, living in a series of rundown shared digs and never letting people get too close to him for fear of revealing his past, it seemed Darko Desic had reached the end of his tether.\nBeing locked-up was preferable to being unemployed and homeless in lockdown. As a police source told AAP: \u201cHe handed himself in to get a roof over his head.\u201d\nThe potency of Desic\u2019s saga has brought pitches from publishers and film-makers. After being sentenced to three-and-a-half years for growing marijuana, he became afraid he would be deported at the end of his sentence back to his homeland. Yugoslavia was collapsing into a civil war that is now regarded as Europe\u2019s last genocide. He then made the decision to escape from prison.\nWhen the news broke in Avalon on 15 September that the fugitive who had been charged by detectives with \u201cescape from lawful custody\u201d was a local, there was consternation.\n\u201cDoes anyone here know Dougie?\u201d shouted an enterprising Channel Seven reporter inside the town\u2019s Mitre 10, surmising that as an odd-job man he would have often gone into the local hardware store. Few Avalon residents, it turned out, knew him \u2013 which is exactly the way he wanted it.\nAnd despite being a self-taught, highly regarded stone mason who specialised in fireplaces and walls, Desic could never afford his own tools on his subsistence and occasional $200-a-day wad of cash.\nFrom 2015, Rob Hornibrooke, a fencer and deck builder, lived next door to Desic. \u201cWe\u2019d chat now and again, but he was pretty reclusive. He helped one of our tenants move out and was very kind to her.\u201d\nAvalon\u2019s community is divided. Some feel that \u201che\u2019s a criminal \u2013 why support him?\u201d\nOthers say he should be given a second chance \u2013 exemplified by a hand-painted sign on the road into Avalon.\nIt reads: \u201cFree Dougie.\u201d\nAvalon businessman Peter Higgins, co-founder of Mortgage Choice, was at Avalon beach \u201con that beautiful Sunday\u201d when Desic handed himself in.\nLike most adult locals, Higgins hasn\u2019t ventured into native woodlands on the crest of the dunes where the escaper spent his last two nights of freedom.\nHiggins, 61, heard about Desic\u2019s plight alongside his daughter, Belle \u2013 a psychotherapist like her mother, Rebecca.\n\u201cBelle said, \u2018Dad, why don\u2019t we start a Go Fund Me campaign to help this guy? We\u2019ve got a voice, he hasn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\nHer target was initially $30,000, but with $26,000 already raised she\u2019s upped the ante to $50,000.\nOriginally the funding was to cover legal costs and Desic\u2019s eventual rehabilitation into the Avalon community.\nHowever Higgins was able to use his business contacts to secure the pro bono services of a top criminal firm, McGirr & Associates. Principal, Paul McGirr, and associate Simon Long visited the prisoner in Silverwater Correctional Complex for an hour last Tuesday.\n\u201cHe had no idea of the community support behind him,\u201d Long says. \u201cHe was completely overwhelmed and humbled to the point of saying, \u2018I don\u2019t deserve this support\u2019.\n\u201cDarko told us that he had always tried to be honest and hard-working since his prison escape, but he\u2019d always kept people at arm\u2019s length for obvious reasons.\n\u201cHe was very apprehensive about the media interest. Apparently he\u2019d told friends he knew his story would end up on the front pages. He was concerned about that. But at the same time, he wanted people to know both the reason he broke out of jail and the reason he turned himself in,\u201d Long says.\nOn 28 September Darko Desic will again appear by audio visual link from his cell in Silverwater prison.\nHis legal team hope to persuade the court to downgrade \u201cescape from custody\u201d \u2013 which can carry a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years \u2013 to a non-custodial sentence doing useful work in his adopted community.\nAnthony Desic, 29, had no idea his cousin was still in Australia until he saw the news last week and thought: \u201cHold on, that\u2019s Darko. He\u2019s supposed to be in Croatia!\u201d\nDesic was sponsored by Anthony\u2019s father, Nikola Desic, to come to Australia in 1975 from what was then Yugoslavia. Both had grown up in Jablanac, an Adriatic port now part of the Croatian Republic.\nThe young Darko was an engineer, working on ferries from Dubrovnik and Split on the Dalmatian coast to Venice. Then he was conscripted into the Yugoslav army.\n\u201cBut then he deserted,\u201d says the mate he confided in, \u201ccame to Australia and knew he could never be deported back there as a deserter once Yugoslavia descended into the Balkan Wars.\u201d\nNikola Desic, his uncle, became his mentor. \u201cThey worked on the same farm in Argents Hill, near Nambucca, NSW, and helped each other a lot,\u201d says Nikola\u2019s son, Anthony.\nAnthony is too young to remember Desic visiting his father when he broke out of prison using, reportedly, a pair of bolt cutters. \u201cBut Dad only had good things to say about him, saying he had a warm heart, was hard-working and helped people whenever he could.\n\u201cHe also told me Darko visited him after the prison escape and said he was going back to Croatia. That\u2019s the last we heard from him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met him,\u201d Higgins says, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty sure he never knew the police had stopped looking for him, or that he had been granted Australian citizenship in 2015.\n\u201cThe community support for him has been amazing. Locals have offered him a home, a job, and at least $26,000 to set himself back on his feet. Plus a family which wants to get back in touch.\n\u201cI look forward to the day he can walk through Avalon\u2019s streets, holding his head high, his shoulders back, and able to say: \u201cThis is who I am!\u201d",

        "content": "A neurology professor wants MND to be listed as a notifiable disease to help investigate suspected environmental links\nA top neurologist has called on the New South Wales government to list motor neurone disease (MND) as a notifiable disease amid suspicions a cluster of diagnoses in the state could be linked to something in the environment.\nProf Dominic Rowe, a neurologist at Macquarie University, has treated 889 MND patients \u2013 many from the NSW irrigation town of Griffith \u2013 in the past decade.\nRowe is concerned the prevalence of cases in the region could be linked to something in the environment, with researchers investigating links to blue-green algae, pesticides and heavy metals.\nBut he says his team is limited in their research because MND is not listed as a notifiable disease \u2013 one that must be reported to authorities.\nIf MND were given notifiable disease status, researchers could access location data that would allow them to see where people with the disease live in relation to places like lakes and water bodies, Rowe said.\nThey have access to \u201cobservational\u201d data from patients, but Rowe says this is \u201cnot comprehensive\u201d.\n\u201cIf we just close our eyes and continue holding people\u2019s hands as they die, that\u2019s not satisfactory at all,\u201d he says.\nMND is a progressive neurological disorder that leaves people unable to walk, speak, swallow and ultimately breathe.\nIn Australia, MND has increased in prevalence by around 250% over the past three decades, according to Rowe.\nWhile 5-10% of cases are believed to be genetic, Rowe says he \u201cstrongly suspects\u201d something in the environment is driving a rise in the remaining sporadic (non-genetic) cases.\nThe data from a notification listing would help researchers zero in on cases and scour the surrounding environment for clues about their cause, Rowe says.\nHe says if an environmental cause can be identified, prevention \u2013 and even a cure \u2013 may be possible, and that \u201cwe should move heaven and earth\u201d to get there.\nNot far from Griffith is a lake surrounded on two sides by picturesque farming land. It has become a focal point for researchers looking into high rates of MND in the region.\nMichelle Vearing says her family visited Lake Wyangan \u201cevery other weekend\u201d while growing up and the kids would spend hours swimming and water skiing in the water. The recreational area of Lake Wyangan is operated by the Griffith city council.\nVearing lost her grandfather and mother to a genetic form of MND and is now supporting her sister Tania Magoci as she battles the disease.\nVearing is a volunteer with the Griffith MND support group, which organises many of its activities through social media. Its Facebook page contain a mix of tributes to people who have died, requests for urine and blood donations for research trials, and fundraising sales of everything from hand-stitched quilts to a treasured rugby league jersey.\n\u201cNearly everyone in town knows someone who has or has passed away from MND,\u201d Vearing says.\nOut of the 30 people in the area who have passed away from the disease over the past decade, many had strong connections to Lake Wyangan or other nearby bodies of water, Vearing says.\nIn recent years the lake has become prone to blooms of cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae, a natural feature in Australian waters and one experts say is thriving as the climate becomes hotter and drier.\nSo far the NSW government has rebuffed the proposal to list MND as a notifiable disease.\nIn June, the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard agreed to meet with representatives from the Macquarie University research team to discuss the proposal, but the meeting was postponed due to the state\u2019s coronavirus outbreak.\nIn a statement, the NSW health department said MND did not meet criteria to be made notifiable, which included \u201cthe potential for outbreaks, a necessity for urgent public health response and preventability\u201d.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nBut experts say a neurotoxin linked to MND, which researchers from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) found in Lake Wyangan in 2019, could be cause for concern and requires more research. The toxin, beta-methylamino-L-alanine, or BMAA, is produced by blue-green algae.\nKen Rodgers, an associate professor of pharmacology at UTS, does not think the science is \u201c100% done and dusted\u201d on the question of whether BMAA causes neurological disease. But he says recent studies are \u201cquite compelling in terms of implicating BMAA in neurodegeneration\u201d and that scientists should be gathering information on where the toxin is located and how much there is.\nThe NSW health department said links between blue-green algae and MND were reviewed in 2015 by scientists from Water Research Australia (WRA), who concluded \u201cthe theory remains unproven\u201d after reviewing more than 200 papers published on BMAA.\nAn updated factsheet from WRA released this month also notes \u201cthere is a lack of scientific consensus that causality has been established\u201d but it acknowledges cyanobacterial blooms are becoming increasingly common and \u201cpose a threat to modern water supply systems\u201d.\n\u201cIt is thus important to understand not only how they may be removed from the water supply \u2026 but also how these toxins affect public health,\u201d the factsheet says.\nDr Rachael Dunlop, an Australian senior research fellow who moved to the US to study links between BMAA and MND, says there is a growing body of evidence to support the theory.\n\u201cIf you look at the amount of publications that have appeared in the peer reviewed literature on this particular subject, there\u2019s been a huge increase in the last five to seven years,\u201d she says.\nThe \u201cmost compelling evidence to date for a direct connection between BMAA exposure and MND\u201d was published in 2020, she says, in a study demonstrating BMAA ingestion caused nerve damage very similar to that seen in the early stages of disease in MND sufferers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s studies \u2026 that have found (BMAA) in postmortem brain samples from people who died of sporadic motor neurone disease.\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t find it in patients that didn\u2019t die from motor neurone disease. And you won\u2019t find it in people that had an unrelated neurodegenerative disease.\u201d\nAnd in one study from the US, researchers found people who live around Lake Mascoma in New Hampshire, which has a history of blue-green algal blooms, were \u201c25 times more likely to contract motor neurone disease\u201d, Dunlop says.\nDunlop says not everyone who is exposed to the toxins in blue-green algae will suffer from MND, but scientists think BMAA may be \u201ca trigger in susceptible individuals\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare people by saying, if you even pass this thing in the street you\u2019re going to get sick. That\u2019s not the case. But it certainly is a factor in a serious disease for which there is not currently a cure.\u201d\nIn NSW, Murray MP Helen Dalton says when a bloom starts at Lake Wyangan the surface of the water becomes slimy and green, \u201cbubbling and festering\u201d, and a rotten smell drifts through the surrounding farmland.\nFor a period in 2017, when the local council drew Griffith\u2019s water supply from the lake, the smell came out of people\u2019s taps, Dalton says.\nGriffith city council and the federal government announced $7m of funding in August to improve water quality at the lake, but Dalton says it will take time for the work to be completed.\nWith hotter and drier climatic trends creating conditions for blue-green algae to thrive, Dunlop says it is likely more people could be exposed to BMAA.\nAnd if there is an environmental link for the disease, Rowe says it is imperative researchers find it before more people are exposed.\nHe says every one of his patients has left him with questions.\n\u201cWhy does this 38-year-old mother of two die? Why does this 55-year-old barrister die with sporadic motor neurone disease?\u201d he says.\n\u201cIf you are numb to the tragedy of this disease and what it does to people and their partners and their families, you shouldn\u2019t be looking after these people.\u201d\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

        "content": "Science needs to recognise and address the vast differences between male and female health, says Prof Cassandra Szoeke\nFor far too long, says Prof Cassandra Szoeke, discussions about women\u2019s health have focused on what she calls \u201cbikini health\u201d, that is, relating only to areas of the body covered by a two-piece. But when the principal investigator of the longest ongoing study of women\u2019s health in Australia gives presentations on this topic, she talks about brains and hearts.\nAfter all, women comprise two-thirds of people living with dementia and it is their leading cause of death, followed by heart disease and stroke.\n\u201cThese are not things we think of as women\u2019s health,\u201d says Szoeke, \u201cand maybe that\u2019s why women are dying of them.\u201d\nIn 1990, a team from the University of Melbourne embarked on an ambitious, landmark study that has by now followed hundreds of middle-aged Australian women into older age over three decades \u2013 and is still going \u2013 to shine a light on this long-neglected area of research. Szoeke joined the team 20 years ago.\n\u201cIf this were a TV show, I would watch every episode,\u201d Szoeke writes in her new book, Secrets of Women\u2019s Healthy Ageing. \u201cThese women have shared so many aspects of their lives with researchers: health, social and emotional, and in many cases their deepest, darkest secrets.\u201d\nThe book describes revelations gleaned from the study mingled with the body of research to date, highlighting the importance of exercise, diet, mental stimulation, sleep, social connectedness and attitude \u2013 no matter what the circumstances.\nInformation from hundreds of women involved in the study has formed a compelling narrative about women\u2019s ageing. Szoeke continues with the TV show metaphor: \u201cPicture more than 400 amazing female characters, appearing in more than 30 seasons and still going strong.\u201d\n\u201cThe women at the heart of this story come from all walks of life ... many were married, some happily, some not,\u201d writes Szoeke. \u201cSome were dealing with the tumult of divorce. Some were single, some shared their lives with other women. Some, not all, were in paid work. Those caring for children or ailing parents could have told you their work was never-ending. Some lived in suburban homes with sports timetables stuck to the fridge; in apartments with freezers stocked with Lean Cuisine; or on new estates at the city\u2019s fringes, where the mortgages were as big as the houses.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s just one lesson gleaned from the study\u2019s observations, Szoeke tells Guardian Australia, it\u2019s to make health a priority in our day-to-day lives. \u201cProbably the most important thing is to think about our health, because it is something that just doesn\u2019t get on our to-do lists.\u201d\nWhile women generally aren\u2019t smoking as much as they used to and are getting their regular pap smears and mammograms, Szoeke\u2019s concern is that they\u2019re not following simple everyday guidelines for good health. A related health survey the team conducted with more than 20,000 women revealed that fewer than half of them had a healthy weight, fewer than a third were getting enough activity, fewer than a fifth were eating enough fruit and veg, and fewer than one in 10 were eating enough fish and legumes.\nGiven that, according to the World Health Organization, such lifestyle factors can prevent 80% of diseases, this is a glaring gap that prompted Szoeke to communicate the research findings in her book. Most surprising to her was the discovery that lifestyle habits are just as vital at 80 as they are at 40.\n\u201cAcross 30 years we were expecting that what we do in middle life is the most important and that over time it would get less important,\u201d she says. \u201cBut across all 30 years of the study to date, every single day counted. It was cumulative. Which meant you could make up for lost time.\u201d\nBeing physically active, for instance, mattered regardless of what form it took. Contrary to expectations, people who did high-intensity workouts weren\u2019t better off. What turned out by far to be most important is moving every day \u2013 even if it\u2019s just housework or walking around the block. Indeed, a Harvard study found that 15 minutes of physical activity a day can prolong your life by three years. Most important is to do something you enjoy.\nThe benefits extend beyond physical health \u2013 for every day of being active, Szoeke\u2019s participants were able to remember an extra word in a memory recall test. This corresponds with other research that shows outstanding benefits of physical activity for preventing dementia.\n\u201cSo any physical activity is the really number one thing you can do for health,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the more you do it, the better you\u2019re at it.\u201d\nOn reflection, Szoeke says the cumulative impact of daily habits makes sense. Chronic diseases of ageing, which include diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, dementia, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, don\u2019t happen overnight \u2013 they take decades to develop. Dementia, for instance, could start developing 30 years before symptoms start appearing.\nThe same goes for the food we eat \u2013 it\u2019s daily habits that count. Going on a diet for a month or even two years or so is not going to allay chronic diseases in the long term. \u201cSo it really is about having the best possible food for your body each and every day,\u201d says Szoeke. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful machine and you want to be using you for a hundred years or so, so use premium fuel and avoid toxins.\u201d\nSimply put, the study confirmed that the foods most common to healthy ageing are vegetables and fruit. Close behind are legumes and fish. The worst were processed foods and sugar. \u201cIf you want to focus on a diet, I\u2019ve just got one bit of advice: don\u2019t have a western diet,\u201d says Szoeke.\nHealthy lifestyle factors become especially important following menopause. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, women over 65 are more likely than their male counterparts to experience \u201csevere or profound disability limiting activities of daily living\u201d. It\u2019s now understood that hormones play vital roles in every aspect of health, yet there is much still to learn about them and their unique impact on women.\nAnother contributor to physical and mental health that cannot be underestimated is social connections.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an extrovert, far from it,\u201d says Szoeke. \u201cSome people want to be alone, but that\u2019s very different to being lonely.\u201d It\u2019s well established that people who are lonely or isolated have poorer immunity and are more likely to suffer health problems such as heart attack, stroke or depression.\nA sense of purpose can play a role. One participant who considered herself a recluse was invited to join a club because she was a good bookkeeper. She didn\u2019t get involved in many of the social events, but she came to realise that she was making an important contribution. \u201cPeople were telling her it was of great value,\u201d says Szoeke, \u201cand she found that suddenly it became a big part of her life and she really valued it.\u201d\nOthers found purpose and connection through joining a community organisation, the local choir, or \u2013 one who described herself as a hermit after her husband died \u2013 just being part of a monthly film club in her apartment complex.\nAmid all of this, attitude emerged as another key factor to healthy ageing. \u201cIt is the surprising secrets that are the most precious,\u201d Szoeke writes, \u201cand one of the ones that surprised us most was that not all socially active women are fit and well.\u201d Many women who engaged with grandchildren or volunteering reported aches and pains, but they took it in their stride and focused on their positive contributions.\nIndeed, those with a positive attitude maintained a positive mood years later regardless of their health status. And at a time of life that can bring massive changes with losing a partner, children leaving home or ill health, an ability to adapt was also important.\n\u201cIf you act on the secrets our women have shared with you \u2013 to move, to eat well, to stress but not distress, to connect \u2013 you will build your intrinsic capacity,\u201d writes Szoeke. \u201cIntrinsic capacity is your ability to weather the storms life throws at us. It is what provides you with resilience in the face of inevitable changes.\u201d\nImportantly, Szoeke dedicates an entire epilogue to the need for science and medicine to recognise and address the vast differences between male and female health. For the new and ongoing insights from the study, she expresses enormous gratitude to the participants.\n\u201cWe would know nothing without them,\u201d she says. \u201cThese women are really quite unique in their altruism and their desire to help. And one thing I found is they actually changed our research through their suggestions. It\u2019s been the women themselves giving us the questions they want answered.\n\u201cThrough my 20 years [in the project], what has been the most important for me, and helped my health, is when these women give tips. The sharing of stories is so powerful and meaningful, and honestly it\u2019s the best way to adopt advice.\u201d\nSecrets of Women\u2019s Healthy Ageing by Prof Cassandra Szoeke is published by Melbourne University Press and is out now",

But perhaps there should have also been note of government policies designed to ensure house prices go berserk even during a global pandemic.\nThis week, the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank, Michele Bullock, spoke with perfect timing about house prices and Australia\u2019s financial stability.\nShe argued that while low interest rates were a reason for strong house prices growth, so too was \u201cthe government support for housing construction, including the homebuilder scheme\u201d.\nAs I noted last week, the lesson of the GFC and the pandemic is that Australian governments will do anything to avoid house prices crashing \u2013 even if that means sending them rocketing up at the expense of affordability.\nAll because Australia\u2019s household wealth is utterly dependent upon land prices going up.\nTake out the 30% rise in land values over the past year, and total household assets rose just 9% rather than 17%.\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, land accounted for around 30% of total household assets; now it is up to 42%.\nLittle wonder then, as the Grattan Institute reported, that 30 years ago well over half of those aged 25-34 owned their own dwelling and now it is down to near 40%.\nAnd so yes, household wealth is going great guns right now. If you are a property owner.\nAnd that is a big if.\nShould the relationship between home loans and prices hold, by the end of this year, Sydney and Melbourne property prices could have risen by as much as 40% in a year. And that in a year in which both cities have been in a lockdown and wages will be lucky to grow by 2%.\nThis is not without risk.\nMichelle Bullock noted in her speech that \u201cif rapid price rises ultimately prove to be unsustainable, they could lead to sharp declines in price and turnover in the future\u201d.\nThis in turn could \u201camplify\u201d any future economic downturns because \u201ca large number of highly indebted households\u201d could cut spending purely because of worries about their debt and a drop in house prices.\nWhat we have seen in the past is governments deciding the solution is to pump the housing market ever more during downturns to avoid that amplification.\nBut that may only be putting off till tomorrow what needs to be faced now \u2013 it really is just a bet that governments can always buoy the market.\nAt least the ALP is thinking about the supply issue and proposes a $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund designed \u201cto build social and affordable housing\u201d.\nWith bitter irony, the fund would be managed by the Future Fund, which is chaired by Peter Costello, the treasurer who oversaw the massive surge in negative gearing and decline of housing affordability due to tax changes in the late 1990s.\nThe lesson of the 2019 election, alas, seems to be that housing affordability policy must never do anything to dampen housing prices.\nNo government wants to be tarred with slowing the growth of wealth, and thus the cycle and cries of despair are likely to continue.\nGreg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

There\u2019s a level playing field, and none of the Brexit-related hassle\u201d.\nThe government said on Saturday night that it planned to train up to 4,000 people as HGV drivers, with the help of military examiners to speed up the process; and letters are being dispatched to recently retired drivers in an attempt to coax them back into the job.\nSenior industry figures said that there would now be a battle between British companies to hire drivers, with companies less able to pay finding themselves short of workers. Sources said that there were already major companies under threat.\nThere were also warnings on Saturday night that an impending shortage of the short-term workers needed to cope with the autumn demand for food pickers and packagers will intensify the crisis.\nTwo thirds (67%) of voters believe the government has handled the crisis badly, according to a new Opinium poll for the Observer. Even a majority of Conservative voters (59%) thought that the government had responded badly. The majority (68%) said Brexit was partly to blame, including 88% of Remain voters and 52% of Leave voters.\nAs well as the shortfall in deliveries to supermarkets, the acute difficulties that have faced the hospitality sector are expected to widen.\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said that there could be as many as four million people who were available to companies at the beginning of last year but are no longer in the potential labour force. He warned of another pinch point in just a few weeks, when agency staff would be needed to deal with the autumn and Christmas peak in demand.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that when we get to the end of September and when we start to look at the crucial role of agency workers in the Christmas rush, there won\u2019t be enough available,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe government needs to come to a pretty speedy resolution on lorry drivers. The question then is, if you call them, will they come?\n\u201cI think the only way we will find that out is by doing so. But you then get into what is a pretty obvious contest about which industry, which company, who can pay most. One in five orders for hospitality from suppliers do not make it. My guess is that several of the supermarkets are in a comparable position which is why there are shortages on the shelves,\u201d said Wright.\nThere were also reports of ambulances and hospital staff being affected by petrol queues, after some petrol retailers said fuel deliveries were unable to reach some forecourts. South Central Ambulance Trust said that on Friday, its staff had \u201cjoined the queues with others to refuel which on some occasions has taken time\u201d.\nMatt McDonnell, the chief executive of Medicare EMS, which has a fleet of ambulances, said that several crews had struggled to get fuel on Saturday. \u201cThis morning, we\u2019ve had a crew driving round for over an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cThey found a garage that had a sign up saying \u2018access to emergency vehicles only\u2019. But our crew were rationed to just 30 litres of fuel.\u201d\nA crew member on an emergency shift in the east of England on Friday posted an angry message on Facebook. Jennifer Ward wrote: \u201cImagine having to go to 5 DIFFERENT petrol stations to get diesel for your AMBULANCE.\u201d There were also reports that workers at a care firm in Kent had not been able to get to people\u2019s homes because of lack of petrol. There are serious warnings about the impact that higher prices, rising energy bills and the incoming cut to universal credit will have on the low-paid. A typical low-income family with children could see their income fall by more than \u00a320 a week over the next six months as a result of the \u201ctriple whammy\u201d, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.",

As was the case in other sports, the lack of spectators made for an eerie experience, but in boxing it also led to something altogether more disturbing \u2013 the sound of pain.\nYou could hear every punch. Every thud to the chest, every crack to the head, and while as a journalist or general observer you know those echoes are always there amid the heat of battle it was unappealing, to say they least, to hear them so raw and unfiltered in near desolate venues.\nQuite simply boxing needs spectators, partly to camouflage its brutality and partly for its very existence. Few sports have suffered more during the past 18 months due to the lack of income from paying punters, with entire livelihoods lost as a result. In that regard the staging of fights in front of no crowds was a survival measure as much as anything else, with the subsequent TV revenue helping to make up some of the shortfall. But ultimately the people needed to return and slowly but surely they have, with no fight, on these shores at least, seeing more come together than the one that took place here.\nAnthony Joshua versus Oleksandr Usyk, an occasion that demanded a big turnout and one that very much got that. Estimates put the attendance between 67,000-68,000, making it not only the largest crowd for a British fight since the return of spectators but also since Joshua\u2019s victory over Alexander Povetkin in front of 70,000 people at Wembley Stadium in September 2018. The fact they packed the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium felt especially fitting given this is a venue that has also suffered during the pandemic \u2013 opened just before Covid struck and rarely filled since.\nIt was packed on Saturday and more than lived up to its billing as a spectacular setting for elite sport; its sleek, towering stands a stunning sight amid the blue-and-white house lights and its renowned acoustics well and truly coming to the fore. You could barely hear yourself think, let alone the sound of a punch, amid the din.\nIt was created by men in their best polo shirts and jeans, and women in their best dresses and heels, sat among famous faces such as Idris Elba and Mo Farah, providing a collective reminder of the glitz and glamour that comes with live boxing. And while some people remain justifiably nervous, even disapproving, of crowds being allowed to return to sporting events given the ongoing prevalence of Covid, to be here was to be reminded that many others have really missed this sort of thing.\nThe noise grew during an undercard that included a victory for Callum Smith over Lenin Castillo via a second-round knockout so brutal that the Dominican fighter had to be carried out of the ring on a stretcher and straight to hospital. By time Joshua and Usyk were ready to rumble, the atmosphere was incredible. Chanting and cheering amid a deafening playlist and which was followed by the traditional pre-main event singing of Sweet Caroline that was wonderfully loud and in synch. The accompanying smart phone-inspired light show wasn\u2019t bad either.\nThe volume rose and fell during the fight itself, which rightly ended in an unanimous points victory for Usyk. The Ukrainian displayed incredible movement, resilience and power to leave Joshua chasing shadows and, ultimately, without his heavyweight titles after a second defeat of his career.\nIt was devastating blow for Joshua in more ways than one, forcing him back once again to the drawing board and further away than ever from a showdown with Tyson Fury. It was also certainly not what the majority of those in attendance wanted to see and to their credit they rose to salute the victor on a night that more than any other since boxing\u2019s emergence from the dark, debilitating shadow of the pandemic, showed the sport is getting off the ropes and back on its feet.",

A new position for any Bulldogs fans born after the 1961 loss when it was still the VFL. We have known heartache before \u2013 just look at the image of Rohan Smith pounding the turf in 1997 after surrendering a 22-point lead in the final quarter of the preliminary final against Adelaide. This is undoubtedly worse and, yet, infinitely better to have made it at all.\nWe just hoped, perhaps, after all the years without success, we could just skip the final hurdle and move straight on to another dose of that pure joy to which the Bulldogs introduced us in 2016. But, this time, it was the Demons\u2019 long-starved fans\u2019 turn to experience that elusive feeling.\nSo now we must come to grips with the other extreme and, with Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT in lockdowns, most of us must do it largely alone. It is the shitty conclusion to what Covid has rendered a strange and unfamiliar finals series. Like so many aspects of our day-to-day lives, the pandemic has thrown out the usual rituals and celebrations involved in the lead up to a grand final \u2013 unless you happen to live in Western Australia. Of course, players and coaches and all team support staff have faced massive disruptions. Still, for fans enduring a post-season from the confines of home, it has all felt a bit off.\nSeparated from other fans and loved ones with whom we have previously shared the highs and lows (and let\u2019s be honest, there were many more lows) \u2013 that burden has fallen on those unlucky enough to live with a Bulldogs supporter. In my case, that is a Sydneysider NRL-loving boyfriend bewildered by the intensity of my feelings about the red, white and blue. Sure, plenty of couples have been tested by lockdown. For us, working from home while sharing one office chair and a dining table in a small apartment was nothing compared to the tension of sitting down to watch the Bulldogs together, even in the regular season. While I am baffled by his enduring optimism towards his objectively hopeless Wests Tigers, he is shocked by the angry grump I turn into at the first sign of trouble for the Dogs.\nAside from the Covid changes, something felt noticeably different about this Bulldogs team, too. Bevo (coach Luke Beveridge) summed it up on Friday when he reflected on the feeling among players in the lead-up to 2016 grand final as being chiefly surprise. Fans too could simply not believe we had made it to the MCG on that last weekend in September. In the stands that day, I turned to my dad, then aged 65 and never having seen a premiership (he adopted the Bulldogs when he started primary school in Altona in 1955) and said just before the opening bounce \u201cit\u2019s all downhill from here\u201d. This year, with their mantra of \u201cyield to none\u201d, this team \u2013 although underdogs going in against the more-favoured Demons \u2013 gave us reason to believe they could do it. On Saturday evening, I was excited and hopeful as Bont led the team out onto the ground. A very strange and unfamiliar feeling indeed.\nBy three-quarter time, hopes well and truly dashed, I retreated to the bathroom to get a head start on the wallowing. \u201cIt\u2019s all over,\u201d I texted to my dad. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to agree,\u201d he responded. At least, my sister offered, the score wasn\u2019t close, thus thwarting any risk he might have a heart attack. My partner kept watching but at least turned it down, muting the Melbourne cheers as they scored goal after goal. When it was finally over, he took down the posters and offered me a cup of tea and some lollies. Next weekend we will watch a movie.",

Whatever the case, it\u2019s going to be a tough winter\n\n The cost of natural gas has quadrupled in four months, but energy companies cannot pass on the increase to customers because prices are capped by the government. The price cap will go up by an average of \u00a3139 in October, but dozens of smaller suppliers are expected to go out of business. When the cap is reviewed in April next year, it may go up by another \u00a3200 or more, some analysts believe. Gas costs are unlikely to fall for months, so heavy industry firms will face higher costs, and the UK is no longer part of the EU\u2019s energy market which allows for simple cross-border trading of energy to keep prices more stable.\n\n  Ministers plan to cut the \u00a320 Covid boost to the basic \u00a3118 a week Universal Credit (UC) payment on 6 October. Income tax, national insurance and the UC taper that means claimants receive only 37p for every \u00a31 earned \u2013 as little as \u00a32.24 per hour \u2013 meaning that someone working full time on the minimum wage would need to find about an extra day\u2019s work each week to make up the shortfall, according to the Resolution Foundation, pushing 800,000 into poverty.\nA potential backbench revolt has forced ministers to look at other options, but plans to tweak the UC taper would mean that \u00a36bn cut would only be reduced to \u00a35bn.\n\n The combination of product shortages, labour shortages and energy price rises will combine to push inflation above 4% for the first time since 2013, according to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. In March, the rate stood at 0.7%.\nInterest rates remain at an all-time low of 0.1%, but even a small rise could be ruinous for millions of people \u2013 the average debt burden per household is \u00a362,705, according to the Money Charity.\n\n A lack of delivery drivers and HGV drivers, as well as other workers in warehouses and food processing plants has led to shortages of products on supermarket shelves and in supplies of diesel and petrol. Retailers\u2019 stock levels are at their lowest since 1983, and levels of imports have plunged, down 17% in August according to the Confederation of British Industry. Business confidence had been rising due to optimism about a post-Covid recovery, but the CBI\u2019s director-general Tony Danker said yesterday the mood had \u201cchanged from growing to coping\u201d.\n\n The pandemic furlough scheme ends on 30 September and between 1.3m to 1.7m remain on full or partial furlough, according to ONS figures. Businesses will either make furloughed workers redundant or need to bring them back on to staff.\nDemand for workers is at a record high, with 223,000 new job ads posted in the week ending 19 September, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. But even with labour shortages, there is likely to be a mismatch between any newly unemployed people and their skills for available jobs.",

        "content": "The biotechnology is comparable to traditional breeding methods and vital to create livestock resistant to disease, droughts and heatwaves, says group\nLeading UK researchers, vets and farmers have urged ministers to free livestock science of unnecessary legal curbs as the country prepares, post-Brexit, to ease gene-editing rules. Such a move would allow the creation of new breeds of animals resistant to disease, heat and drought, they argue.\nThe government is expected to propose easing gene-editing restrictions in the near future to enable the creation of new generations of crops. However, the group \u2013 which has written to the environment secretary, George Eustice \u2013 worries there is less interest in using the technology to create new breeds of pigs, cows and poultry.\n\u201cIt is every bit as important that we use the enormous power of gene editing to create breeds of animals that are resistant to disease, droughts and heatwaves as it is to fashion new crop varieties,\u201d said Professor Bruce Whitelaw of Edinburgh\u2019s Roslin Institute. \u201cThis is particularly important as global warming intensifies and we strive to ensure we are protected against future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.\u201d\nThe value of gene editing in this latter field is shown by work carried out at Roslin and Imperial College London, where scientists have identified a gene that may confer resistance to influenza. \u201cWe can now think about using gene editing to create breeds resistant to avian and swine flu, and so curb outbreaks on farms, while also reducing the risk of triggering future pandemics in humans,\u201d added Whitelaw, one of the letter\u2019s signatories.\nOther recent developments in the gene editing of livestock include the creation of pigs that can fight off a disease known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which is devastating pig herds globally. \u201cUsing gene editing this way has enormous power to save billions of pounds and to stop animal suffering,\u201d said Whitelaw.\nEarlier, the creation of new strains of plants or animals in the laboratory involved the transfer of entire genes or groups of genes from one species to another and was known as genetic modification. The EU strictly regulates GM technology.\nMore recent techniques of gene editing involve making slight changes to existing genes in a plant or animal and are considered to be as safe as traditional plant breeding techniques. The European court of justice nevertheless controversially ruled in 2018 that gene editing was essentially the same as genetic modification and should be subject to tight rules.\n\u201cGene-editing research in the UK has been hampered by the unnecessary and unscientific regulatory barriers we have inherited from the EU,\u201d said Professor Helen Sang, also of the Roslin Institute and a signatory of the letter. \u201cThis leaves us lagging behind the approach taken in other parts of the world, such as Japan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Canada.\u201d\nBritain is expected to throw off these legislative shackles with an announcement soon from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, a report by the Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform earlier this year advised the government to press ahead with regulatory reform of gene editing of plants and crops but was more cautious about its use on livestock.\nSuch an emphasis would represent a lost opportunity, said Professor Lord Trees, an expert in vaccine parasitology and another signatory to the letter. \u201cThe UK\u2019s strength in genome sequencing, together with our preservation of rare breeds and genetic diversity offers great potential.\n\u201cThis could have a very significant impact in reducing antimicrobial and antiparasitic drug usage and help overcome the challenges of resistance to chemical treatment, as well as the problem of environmental contamination with drug residues.\u201d\nMany green groups remain opposed to the creation of new, gene-edited breeds of pigs, cows and poultry, arguing that they will only worsen the intensification of factory farming.\n\u201cSome people just don\u2019t like the idea of genetically altering animals,\u201d said Whitelaw. \u201cBut we have been doing that for thousands of years, and have turned wolves into chihuahuas and no one seems to mind.\u201d",

        "content": "Staff attrition, high demand for appointments and enraged human clients have strained vet practices across the US\nEarly in the pandemic, Dr Monica Mansfield, a veterinarian based in Medway, Massachusetts, became haunted by a recurring nightmare.\n\u201cThere were these vulnerable kittens in my basement, and I forgot to feed them,\u201d Mansfield recalls. \u201cI\u2019d wake up, terrified. \u2018Oh my gosh, the kittens! Where are they?\u2019 I felt like I was missing details and forgetting things that were critical to a case \u2013 that were critical to an animal\u2019s life.\u201d\nMansfield took the hint from her subconscious and extended her workday hours. She decided she\u2019d rather work longer days to keep up with patient needs, for her own peace of mind.\nVeterinary workers might recognize Mansfield\u2019s kitten care nightmares as a sign of the times.\nThroughout the pandemic, vet staff have endured spikes in demand for services alongside slowed-down curbside protocols, labor shortages and appointment backlogs. The array of overlapping circumstances has created a cascade of problems powerful enough to threaten the entire delicate ecosystem of veterinary care.\nFor pet owners, it translates to a fiasco of crowded animal hospitals and long appointment wait times. Some have even been turned away from veterinary offices with sick animals in tow. Altogether, the situation has created something of a perfect storm \u2013 causing heartbreak and frustration for pet owners and veterinary personnel alike.\nDr Lisa Kimball, a veterinarian based in Hingham, Massachusetts, recalls an incident involving an elderly patient \u2013a cat \u2013 who was running a high fever and not responding to antibiotics. Kimball knew that the situation called for 24-hour intravenous fluids and monitoring, if there was any hope for the cat\u2019s survival. But her general practice clinic isn\u2019t set up to manage intensive-care patients overnight.\nKimball called two different emergency clinics, but neither would be able to treat her patient in time. In the end, the cat had to be put to sleep.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if the outcome would have been much different if she had gotten the emergency care she needed,\u201d says Kimball. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t even an option.\u201d\nEmergency veterinary capacity has been strained since the early days of the pandemic, when many clinics across the country were open only for urgent care cases. For some hospitals, it was a period of downright quiet. \u201cLooking back on that time, I almost have to laugh at myself about how stressed I was that we might lose the business,\u201d says Dr Diana Thom\u00e9, a companion animal veterinarian based in Richland, Washington.\nInstead, that initial lull caused a ripple effect that persists to this day. Lockdowns limited services, which created bottlenecks in preventative care. When services were restored, pandemic safety protocols hampered vets\u2019 ability to make up for lost time. All the while, backlogs at emergency hospitals trickled down to general practice clinics.\n\u201cFor the first time ever in my 17-year-career, we have had periods where we have not been accepting new clients,\u201d says Thom\u00e9. \u201cWhich is really hard for us because that means an animal is going without care in a lot of situations.\u201d\nMeanwhile, more and more pet owners sought out emergency vet services to treat acute complaints like ear or bladder infections \u2013 ailments that aren\u2019t necessarily life-threatening, but are nonetheless painful for pets.\n\u201cIt overwhelmed us very quickly,\u201d says Kasey Littlefield, a veterinary technician who works at emergency clinics in Los Angeles county. The deluge has yet to let up.\nSome blame spikes in pet ownership for the ongoing debacle. But the American Veterinary Medical Association found that nationally, pet adoptions from shelters were actually lower in 2020 than they have been in five years. A higher proportion of adoptable rescue pets found homes, but there were fewer animals up for adoption in the first place because of shelter closures and decreased pet surrenders.\nLabor shortages play a role. Vet staff, predominantly female, have had to juggle childcare and work; Kimball now works just two days a week to balance demands at home. Others, burned out by the high stress of the past 18 months or seeking higher paying jobs, have reduced hours or left the profession entirely.\nThe AVMA notes that staff attrition is historically high in veterinary medicine, especially among vet techs. \u201cSince the pandemic started, if we post a position, we\u2019ll be lucky to get a qualified applicant,\u201d says Thom\u00e9.\nAmid heightened tensions, some vet staff have faced aggression from disgruntled pet owners.\n\u201cI had a client, just last Saturday, who threw a milkshake at the front window,\u201d says Littlefield, chuckling in disbelief.\nSometimes, the confrontations turn physical. Littlefield recalls an incident last year when she was backed against the clinic\u2019s front door by a client whose pet she had to turn away. \u201cI was able to duck in and lock the door behind me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the first time I\u2019d had a client get in my face, physically threatening me like that.\u201d\nOverall, Littlefield says, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of anger, a lot of verbal abuse, especially towards the staff at the front.\u201d\nKimball notes that it\u2019s often the front desk staff who have to give clients bad news \u2013 and having to tell people so often there\u2019s a wait for an appointment wears them down. \u201cPeople that are normally very happy and perky and kind of roll with the punches \u2013 you can see the strain on them now,\u201d she says.\nLiz Hughston, the president of the National Veterinary Professionals Union, says that across the board, veterinary staff tend to have a stoic attitude toward client outbursts. \u201cPeople are just willing to accept those things because we love what we do,\u201d she says .\nThe compounding pressure does, however, take a toll. Jamie Falzone, the executive director of the Massachusetts Veterinary Medical Association, says that in a recent survey, almost all the organization\u2019s members reported a dramatic increase in stress. This stress is in addition to the mental health challenges that have always faced veterinary staff. Pre-pandemic, veterinary professionals were at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population. While US data is limited on the current state of affairs, some insight can be gleaned across national borders; in a recent industry-wide survey of Canadian veterinarians, about 26% reported suicidal ideation over the first 12 months of the pandemic.\nThe stress of the profession boils down to what veterinary staff and pet owners have in common: They love their furry and feathered clients, and genuinely want to provide care. Vets also empathize with the humans who are entrusting them with the health of their beloved companions.\n\u201cWe rejoice and embrace the puppies and the rescue dogs \u2013 the new lights of people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Mansfield.\nShe often reminds her staff \u2013 and herself \u2013 that they need to practice patience. \u201cI always try to understand that people are coming from different places,\u201d she says.\nBut in a profession already under immense strain, veterinary clinic staff could also use some of that consideration coming from the public, in return.\n\u201cI hope people know that we\u2019re here to help them,\u201d says Littlefield. \u201cAnd we appreciate any patience and grace they can give us.\u201d",

        "content": "Party sees new urgency \u2013 and political opportunity \u2013 amid growing threat to Roe v Wade\nStanding on the lawn of the US Capitol, in clear view of the supreme court, a coalition of Democratic women declared Roe v Wade was no longer the law of the land.\nNearly half a century after the court established the constitutional right to abortion, it allowed a near-complete ban to stand in Texas, the second-most populous state. Though the 5-4 decision did not address the substance of the Texas law, Democrats warn that it was a mere taste of things to come from the court \u2013 and Republicans who helped expand its conservative majority.\n\u201cWhen this court embraced this shameful Texas law, they brought shame to the United States supreme court,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said at a press conference on Friday, ahead of a vote on legislation effectively codifying abortion rights into federal law. \u201cWhat were they thinking, or were they thinking, or were they just rubber-stamping what they were sent to the court to do?\u201d\nAfter her remarks, Pelosi returned to the chamber to preside as Democrats narrowly approved the bill. The vote was largely symbolic \u2013 Republican opposition in the Senate all but ensures the measure will not become law. Yet the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he planned to bring it to the floor anyway.\nThe urgent push, however futile, was a reflection of just how powerful Democrats believe the issue could be in coming elections.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in totally uncharted territory,\u201d said Cecile Richards, a former president of Planned Parenthood who now co-chairs a Democratic political action committee, American Bridge 21st Century. \u201cThis is a day that people certainly hoped would never come. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at now and there\u2019s no way to be on the sidelines.\u201d\nIn Washington and beyond, Democrats are embracing the struggle over abortion, portraying themselves as the last line of defense against further erosion \u2013 or outright abolition \u2013 of a constitutional right many believed settled long ago.\nJoe Biden has weighed in, promising a \u201cwhole of government\u201d response. The justice department is suing Texas over its law, which bans abortion at roughly six weeks, before most women even know they\u2019re pregnant.\nThis week, the supreme court announced it would hear oral arguments on 1 December in a case involving a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks, a direct challenge to Roe. A ruling is expected next year, before the November elections.\nThe Democrats\u2019 focus on reproductive rights also reflects shifting political dynamics.\nUnity on abortion is a relatively recent development for the party. After successive defeats in rural America, and defections among white working class voters, Democrats won majorities in Congress with a coalition of urban and suburban college-educated voters who tend to be more socially liberal.\nWhile Americans\u2019 views are notoriously difficult to survey, polling has found that attitudes on abortion have remained relatively consistent. A solid majority say the procedure should remain legal with some restrictions.\nA recent Monmouth University poll found that a majority of Americans want abortion to be legal in all or some circumstances. More than six in 10 said they did not want the court to revisit Roe. Among Americans with a college degree, support for keeping abortion mostly legal was even higher.\nPublic opinion hasn\u2019t been a barrier for anti-abortion activists, who have aligned with the Republican party to enact laws severely restricting access to the procedure in states across the country. They also made the supreme court a political priority, culminating in a 6-3 conservative majority, led by three appointees of Donald Trump.\n\u201cReproductive justice organizers were effectively out-organized in state legislatures, particularly after the Tea Party wave in 2010, and there really hasn\u2019t been an effective response since then,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at Florida State University and author of Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v Wade to the Present. But, she said, that could change as more Americans come to terms with the reality that abortion is now effectively outlawed in a state like Texas.\nMobilizing support for abortion rights becomes \u201ceasier, ironically, in moments of crisis like this because everybody agrees that criminalizing abortion would be really bad if you\u2019re on the pro-choice side of the debate\u201d, Ziegler said.\nDemocrats say fear of losing Roe is motivating voters beyond their liberal base.\n\u201cPeople have always believed that somehow, at the end of the day, no matter what politicians did, that the judicial system would be there to back up women,\u201d Richards said. \u201cThat just simply isn\u2019t true any more. Now we actually have to face the consequences of making abortion illegal.\u201d\nBut the issue is also energizing abortion opponents, activists say.\n\u201cThis moment is a culmination of years of pro-life strategy and the stakes have never been higher,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a vice-president of the Susan B Anthony List. She said her group was already knocking on doors in battleground states including Arizona and Georgia, seeking to mobilize \u201cpro-life base voters\u201d as well as those \u201cwho can be persuaded to vote for the pro-life candidate\u201d.\nNationally, Republicans have been more circumspect.\nRepublicans \u201chave long been able to talk aggressively about abortion while knowing that the most aggressive policies would either fail in legislatures or be struck down by the courts\u201d, said Joshua Wilson, a political scientist at the University of Denver and author of The New States of Abortion Politics.\nThat certainty is gone now.\n\u201cIf Roe is overturned or otherwise significantly eroded,\u201d Wilson said, \u201cthe GOP will own that change.\u201d\nEven as Republicans in states like Florida, Arkansas and South Dakota promise copycat legislation, polling has found that most Americans believe the Texas law goes too far. Particularly objectionable, surveys found, is the failure to include exceptions for rape or incest and a provision effectively deputizing ordinary citizens to bring lawsuits against anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an illegal abortion \u2013 with the potential to earn $10,000.\nDemocrats face a challenging electoral landscape in 2022 as they seek to defend their fragile majorities in the House and Senate and defy a historical pattern in which the president\u2019s party suffers midterm losses. Whether abortion remains front and center in national debate will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the pandemic and the economic recovery.\nElections in Virginia this fall\u200b will provide the first major test of how \u200bthe issue resonates with voters\u200b, particularly \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bsuburban women who were critical to Biden\u2019s win.\nThe Democrats running for statewide office have all seized on the Texas law as a harbinger of what is to come in Virginia if Republicans are elected.\nTerry McAuliffe, a former governor running to recapture the office, is portraying himself as a \u201cbrick wall\u201d against efforts to restrict abortion access. His opponent, Glenn Youngkin, hit back at McAuliffe in a digital ad, calling the former governor\u2019s stance on abortion \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for Virginia.\nOlivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, said voters who oppose abortion had been mobilizing since 2020, when the Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, signed legislation that overturned longstanding restrictions.\n\u201cWe in Virginia who care about the pro-life issue were already very alert and aware of the stakes,\u201d Gans Turner said. McAuliffe\u2019s \u201cobsession with the subject\u201d, she said, had helped to put it front and center in a way that she believed would further motivate abortion opponents and possibly alienate moderates.\nAbortion rights activists say fear that Roe is at risk is resonating with voters across Virginia, including with those who may not have previously considered abortion a priority.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much at stake now that Texas\u2019s abortion ban has opened the floodgates to similar bans across the country,\u201d said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, which is working to elect Democrats. \u201cA Texas-style ban could easily come to Virginia if Glenn Youngkin is elected governor and Republicans take control of the house of delegates.\u201d\nLockhart said she had observed an increase in enthusiasm among voters and volunteers, some of whom pointed to the Texas law.\n\u201cFrom what we\u2019re seeing on the ground \u2013 the increased level of enthusiasm that we\u2019re seeing from from our volunteers and supporters,\u201d she said, \u201cthere absolutely is the potential that Virginians\u2019 support for abortion rights is the difference-maker in this election.\u201d",

        "content": "The murder of Sarah Everard shone a spotlight on a culture of male harassment and violence against women and girls, sparking protests and calls for reform. Now the killing of Sabina Nessa has appalled the nation\nTanya was only 12 years old when it first happened. It was a sunny afternoon in Birmingham and she was just getting off the bus she took from school every day. The bus was busy and she was keen to get off \u2013 that\u2019s when she noticed the two men standing just behind her. \u201cAs I was passing by the stairs, I felt one of them pushing me to the side, then before I knew what was happening the other one quickly started taking pictures and videos underneath my skirt. I was wearing my school uniform and everyone could see but nobody said anything.\u201d\nTearful and shocked, Tanya got off the bus and called her cousin. \u201cShe said, \u2018You know what, these things happen. It\u2019s a shame that we live in a world like this but that is the way things are\u2019.\u201d She went to her school but this was their response: \u201cThey told me \u2018you should start wearing longer skirts\u2019.\u201d\nEleven years and a number of other incidents of sexual harassment later, Tanya has had enough. She doesn\u2019t want to be told that it\u2019s just the way life is. She wants something to change. And she\u2019s not the only one.\nWhat has been described as an \u201cepidemic\u201d of sexual harassment, primarily against girls and women, has slowly been revealing itself in the last few months in this country \u2013 and millions of people like Tanya are angry. A sense of the scale of this abuse became evident when the website Everyone\u2019s Invited, which encourages survivors to share their stories, revealed thousands of testimonies, many from school-aged girls, cataloguing abuse ranging from unwanted sexual comments, cyberflashing (the sending of unsolicited explicit images) and harassment, to sexual assault and rape.\nBut it\u2019s not just harassment and assault that have been pushed into the spotlight like never before, it\u2019s serious violence against women and girls, and, in the worst cases, murder. Conspicuous and horrific cases like the deaths of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, sisters who were repeatedly stabbed in a park in north-west London last year, and,Julia James, the PCSO killed while walking her dog in woods near her home this summer.\nYet, arguably, none were as high profile as the murder on 3 March 2021 of 33-year-old Sarah Everard.\nSome argued that the focus on her death was because she was white. Others said it was because of the perpetrator, a man who it transpired was one of the very people whose job it is to protect women. Met police officer Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty and will be sentenced on 29 September.\nWhatever the reason, her death became a watershed moment. Women recognised the vulnerability of Everard\u2019s situation as she walked home alone, they felt the fear she may have felt even before being accosted, and too many recognised the pain of the subsequent violence.\nGrief turned to anger. There was a vigil in her name on Clapham Common in London, which only increased the backlash against the police when they were accused of being heavy handed with female protestors. Enough is enough, women seemed to collectively say, and politicians found themselves forced to respond.\nThings will change, they promised. But six months on, what, if anything, has actually changed? We are now faced with another act of femicide, with the murder of primary school teacher Sabina Nessa last week, and the outpouring of anger and frustration is audible once more.\nFor Caroline Nokes, Conservative MP and chair of the cross-party women and equalities select committee, the events in March heralded a significant moment in her own life, both personally and professionally.\nIt opened up important conversations with people that she may never have otherwise had. This was with both her male colleagues, her 23-year-old daughter and even her mother, who wanted to know if women really did feel scared every time they walked home alone at night.\n\u201cYes, I told her, yes we do,\u201d she says. \u201cI was heartened by the number of male colleagues who then approached me privately, saying, \u2018what can I do to make women around me feel safer? If I\u2019m walking home late at night, and there is a woman in front of me, how can I let her know I\u2019m not a threat?\u2019\u201d\nSo what is the answer, what can be done to make women and girls feel safer? One thing that has repeatedly been called for by campaigning groups and individuals is a change in emphasis in the way police deal with gender-based crimes against women and girls. Earlier this month a root-and-branch examination by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), commissioned by Priti Patel following Everard\u2019s murder, found huge inconsistencies across police forces in dealing with the epidemic of violence against female victims in the UK.\nMany were neither working closely enough with colleagues from other agencies nor giving the threat of violence the resources it deserved. That response sharply contrasted to how police dealt with terrorism and, more recently, county lines drugs gangs. The report recommended \u201ccross-system changes\u201d with councils, courts, teachers and the NHS, among others, required to work together with the police to prevent violence against women and girls.\nThat is something 26-year-old Jennifer Llewellyn can relate to after she became a victim of a sexual offence last summer. One evening during lockdown, she was going for a run in her home city of Sheffield. The streets were quiet as all bars and pubs were shut, which was why she found it odd when a car pulled up alongside her. \u201cI remember looking into the car and seeing a man smiling and jerking something. I [felt] really shocked and embarrassed and I ran away.\u201d\nThe next day she reported the incident to the police and, to her surprise, learned that the man had done this a number of times before. With the collective testimonies and his guilty plea, the police were eventually able to secure a conviction.\nThe outcome, however, left Llewellyn, who works with grassroots group Our Bodies Our Streets, conflicted. \u201cI was glad there had been some sort of consequence but, at the same time, I thought, if he\u2019d already been known to the police, then how did this happen to me?\u201d\nOne of the other major pieces of work that came out following Everard\u2019s death was the government\u2019s strategy on tackling violence against women and girls (VAWG). Following her murder, its publication was brought forward to July this year and received 180,000 responses, a figure unheard of from a government call for evidence. The strategy concluded with a number of actions that the government promised to press ahead with, including reviewing existing legislation and launching a public awareness campaign.\nNokes believes that while the VAWG strategy is a significant step in the right direction, there were some serious omissions. \u201cThere is still an enormous piece of work to do around public sexual harassment, and making that a specific crime,\u201d she says.\nPlan International UK, one of the largest global children\u2019s charities, agrees and has been working on a campaign, in conjunction with grassroots campaigners Our Streets Now, designed to put pressure on the government to fix legislation in this area.\n\u201cWe have this piecemeal set of laws stretching back hundreds of years and they are the only thing that legislates in any way on this,\u201d says Georgie Laming, campaigns manager at the charity. \u201cThere\u2019s one law from the 1600s called outraging public decency, which was used to prosecute a man for urinating off the balcony in Covent Garden. And that is still the law that is being used to cover this area.\u201dThe organisation has been working with two leading human rights lawyers to draft a bill that they hope will go before parliament. It includes the crucial elements of public space, \u201csexual\u201d conduct, a mental element (that is, \u201cintention\u201d to cause harassment or \u201crecklessness\u201d about the effect it would have) and a proportionate penalty, from a fine up to one year\u2019s imprisonment.\n\u201cThe government acknowledged the premise of our argument when they published their strategy in July,\u201d says Laming. \u201cBut they still haven\u2019t yet gone as far as saying \u2018we\u2019ll make these things a crime\u2019. What they have committed to is a review of the current law, which we urge them to do as soon as possible.\u201d\nNokes thinks waiting for a review could \u201ctake for ever\u201d and that a much easier fix would be for the government to add public sexual harassment to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which is currently with the House of Lords. \u201cNot including it was a missed opportunity to put this on the statute book as a standalone crime,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think government could even, at this stage, add that to the bill.\u201d\nLabour MP Harriet Harman tried and failed to add public sexual harassment to the bill when it was before parliament, she says, but she agrees with Nokes that there is still a chance, though she believes a better opportunity may now present itself in the victims bill, which is currently at a relatively early stage in the Commons. It is this bill that she also wants to use to see an end to the routine use of a victim\u2019s sexual history in rape cases, as well as an end to the defence of \u201cit was rough sex gone wrong\u201d in murder cases.\nWhat she does think could be a game-changer is the fact of having a woman home secretary in Patel and a woman attorney general, Suella Braverman, in power at the same time. \u201cThis has come just as there is this real mood among women and girls in the country that there needs to be change,\u201d she says. \u201cSo they have got this huge movement behind them if they are actually prepared to go forward. And if they don\u2019t, people will say, what was the point of getting women into senior positions if they didn\u2019t deliver for other women?\u201d\nThe government says it is looking into gaps in existing law and how a specific offence for public sexual harassment could address those but is mindful that any potential legislation is proportionate. \u201cCertain crimes disproportionately affect women and girls, manifest themselves in different ways, and demand targeted solutions,\u201d said Rachel Maclean, the minister for safeguarding.\n\u201cThe first ever national police lead on VAWG starts her role next month, we will soon be rolling out a behaviour change campaign and an online repository of all domestic homicide reviews will soon be live, so we can better understand, analyse and ultimately prevent these horrific crimes.\u201d\nOne of the other key messages that came out of all the sharing of stories on Everyone\u2019s Invited following Everard\u2019s death was the role that schools play. The schools inspection body Ofsted was so concerned by the volume and detail in the testimonies that came out on the website, largely from school-age children, that it carried out an emergency investigation at the end of the last school term. It concluded that sexual harassment of girls had become a way of life and that schools were seriously lacking when it came to helping identify and prevent it.\nFor 21-year-old Phoebe, the first signs of harassment began with boys twanging the girls\u2019 bra straps at the ages of nine or 10. Then, when she moved into sixth form and she could wear what she wanted, she was horrified by comments some of the boys would make about her body. \u201cThings that would make you kind of retreat into your shell and think, \u2018I don\u2019t want to wear [this] any more\u2019.\u201d\nRecent research carried out by Girlguiding, which wants to see better education in school around consent and acceptable behaviours, found that almost 70% of girls have experienced sexual harassment at school from another student.\n\u201cEducation, for me, is key from a young age, and this needs to start from within schools,\u201d says Phoebe, who is an advocate for the organisation. \u201cIt\u2019s not just \u2018oh, boys will be boys\u2019. It needs to be \u2018No, you shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u2019. We need to be constantly reminded, firstly through school and then in the workplace.\u201d\nThe NSPCC, which opened a helpline for schools following the fallout on Everyone\u2019s Invited, has listened to some harrowing testimony in the last few months. It was given funding until the end of October by the government for a helpline dealing specifically with cases of peer-on-peer abuse in schools. It has received more than 650 calls in the last five months.\nSandra Robinson, a manager at the helpline, says she and her colleagues have taken calls on everything from sexual name calling and inappropriate touching, to sexual abuse and rape. \u201cWith many of the calls, the caller has told somebody but it either hasn\u2019t been taken seriously or hasn\u2019t been escalated appropriately within the school,\u201d she says. \u201cThis leaves the child feeling very confused about what\u2019s appropriate or not.\u201d\nThe NSPCC believes one of the key things to take out from what happened on Everyone\u2019s Invited is that the government needs to help provide schools with better training for teachers on the subject of sexual abuse and harassment so that they can teach this effectively as part of the new mandatory relationships, sex and health education (RSHE).\nDarren Gelder is head of Grace Academy, a state secondary school in Solihull. He is also the father of three daughters \u2013 and Everard\u2019s death reignited fears he had about safety on the streets. \u201cOne of my daughters lives in London and will tell me that she\u2019s walking in Queen\u2019s Park [West London] at 11 o\u2019clock at night. As a parent and as a father that really worries me.\u201d\nHe believes that schools need to make sure there are measures that extend beyond the curriculum to deal with issues such as sexual harassment. At Grace Academy there are QR codes around the school that students can use to anonymously report their concerns, for example, and twice a year parents are invited to attend \u201cbuilding healthy relationships\u201d meetings off the school premises.\nWhen Ofsted comes knocking this year, Gelder says it\u2019s these sorts of things schools will need to get right.\nBut while he is pleased this issue is being given priority by the schools inspectorate, Gelder is not convinced school leaders should bear the brunt of responsibility for tackling the issues that led to so called \u201crape culture\u201d (a phrase coined by the founder of Everyone\u20190s Invited and then reused extensively). The Ofsted report was clear that the majority of abuse that it came across took place at parties and in parks and not actually on school premises.\n\u201cWhat now must fall under our remit includes knife crime, county lines, exploitation, healthy diets, taking exercise, being safe online and sexting to name a few,\u201d says Gelder. \u201cSurely we have to ask: is there a parental, a societal, a wider issue that sits with this? Or is this really a school\u2019s problem to solve? We have a role to play and no one shying away from that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a school\u2019s role.\u201d\nOne hundred and twenty miles further south from Gelder\u2019s school in a completely different type of setting is Jane Lunnon. She is head of Alleyns, a fee-paying mixed school. She is dismissive of the initial focus on private schools that the fallout on Everyone\u2019s Invited provoked.\n\u201cI never thought about the issue as being sector specific but I was very glad when the Ofsted review happened because that was a national review that looked at the whole education sector and found it lacking,\u201d she says.\nBefore Everard\u2019s death the school had things in place such as lessons about what is and isn\u2019t appropriate online. \u201cBut what clearly came up as a result of Sarah Everard\u2019s death and the aftermath was that these measures were not not landing sufficiently,\u201d she says.\nLike Gelder, she believes that what is needed in many schools is a complete culture change. After Everard\u2019s murder, the school \u201cwent back to root and branch,\u201d says Lunnon and wrote a complete development plan around the issue of sexual harassment. All the staff were given training by UK Feminista, which provides schools with an online course in how to tackle sexism and sexual harassment. The school has also set up \u201cgender equality champions\u201d, pupils who, in conjunction with teachers, have written a gender charter that all students must follow.\nEighteen-year-old Max is a year 13 student at Alleyns and one of the new gender equality champions for the school. He says he\u2019s pleased boys are involved in the conversation about solutions. \u201cThere have always been times when you hear stories about what goes on at parties and so on but I heard a lot more of those after the fallout on Everyone\u2019s Invited. Now that I\u2019m more aware of it, I\u2019m also more open to talking about it both with boys and with my friends who are girls.\u201d\nWhatever resources the government chooses to put into action on sexual harassment and violence towards women and girls, it needs to be done fast, says Nokes.\n\u201cThe government would be very, very foolish not to grab the opportunity right now to spell out what they are going to do to make things better. And if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s a real danger that we will lose the momentum that came from Sarah Everard\u2019s death and, tragically, people will begin to forget,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe real takeaway from these tragic events is that, actually, we have run out of patience.\nYoung people and adults can contact the NSPCC helpline, Report Abuse in Education on 0800 136 663 or email help@nspcc.org.uk",

        "content": "Dev Patel works his subtle magic in David Lowery\u2019s enthralling take on the medieval tale of the questing Gawain \nWhat a strange and peculiarly powerful film this is. An ambitious adaptation of the chivalric poem about the adventures of an Arthurian knight, written in Middle English by an unknown author (and most famously translated in the 21st century by Simon Armitage), The Green Knight is the best work yet from David Lowery, director of Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints and A Ghost Story. Capitalising on leading man Dev Patel\u2019s uncanny ability to embody a combination of weakness and strength, wretchedness and valour, Lowery\u2019s haunting epic takes the viewer on a mythical quest, replete with flaming heads and eerie giants, that condenses the emotional weight of Peter Jackson\u2019s entire Lord of the Rings trilogy into just over two hours of dense screen magic.\nIt\u2019s Christmas Day at the Round Table, as the king (a sympathetic Sean Harris) invites his wastrel nephew Gawain (Patel) to sit by his side. The still-to-be knighted Gawain insists he has no tale to tell, to which the Queen (played with chilly magnetism by Kate Dickie) simply adds: \u201cYet.\u201d When the giant titular knight appears, looking like a verdant cousin of Peter Jackson\u2019s Treebeard, and makes his blow-for-blow challenge (\u201cit is only a game\u201d), Gawain takes his mighty axe and chops off his head, sealing his fate. A year later, he must journey to the Green Knight\u2019s woodland chapel and receive a similar wound in return. En route, his mettle will be tested by thieves and temptresses alike.\nDespite cleaving more closely to the original text than previous screen incarnations (we\u2019re a million miles away from the cod antics of 1984\u2019s Sword of the Valiant), Lowery\u2019s sumptuously elusive film nevertheless makes several innovative leaps, emphasising duality and ambiguity. Gone is any clear revelation of the Green Knight\u2019s identity, replaced with subtle visions suggesting that his \u201ctrue\u201d personality is legion. The enchantress puppet master of the original is now also Gawain\u2019s mother, mesmerisingly played by Sarita Choudhury, setting otherworldly Oedipal wheels in motion.\nDuring the chaptered settings of Gawain\u2019s journey, A Meeting with St Winifred finds our antihero arriving at a Hansel and Gretel-like cottage where he is pointedly charged with retrieving the saint\u2019s severed head, thereby intertwining two legends. There is also a complex double role for Alicia Vikander, first seen as Gawain\u2019s lowly lover, Essel, then reappearing as the lady of the castle who tempts him into sticky deceit. Vikander also gets to deliver the film\u2019s mission statement, an elegantly modern speech balanced between horror and wonder, about nature reclaiming the Earth, transforming the travails of man into mere moss.\nAudacious visions of possible futures dramatically haunt the present. After an encounter with a battlefield scavenger (Barry Keoghan, sporting a feral glint), a beautifully choreographed, slowly circling shot conjures a compact, Zardoz-style image of death foretold and then reversed. Later, Gawain\u2019s flight from his destiny combines the existential melancholia of Scorsese\u2019s The Last Temptation of Christ with the imagined final battle of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2. It sounds absurd, and on some levels it\u2019s just that. Yet Lowery\u2019s cinematic instincts are astute, leading the audience toward a finale that is both satisfying and tantalising, doubtless provoking heated post-film debate.\nHaving re-edited The Green Knight during lockdown \u201cto cut it with love in my heart instead of disappointment and hate\u201d, Lowery cheekily cites Ron Howard\u2019s Willow as an inspiration, alongside Robert Bresson\u2019s Lancelot du Lac and Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones\u2019s Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I saw echoes of the colour-coded fantasia of Vincent Ward\u2019s What Dreams May Come, the talking-fox madness of Lars von Trier\u2019s Antichrist (in which \u201cnature is Satan\u2019s church\u201d) and the sheer WTF daringness of Michael Tolkin\u2019s The Rapture.\nA rich dramatic score by Daniel Hart and dreamy cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo add to the intoxicating spell. If the result sends viewers scuttling back to Armitage\u2019s uniquely accessible version of the source text, then that would be marvellous indeed. But there is enough here that is dazzling and enthralling for Lowery\u2019s movie to stand proudly as a grand work of poetry in its own right.",

        "content": "The party leader has drafted in aides who worked for ex-prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\nThere are figures who worked for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and others who have joined after spending years in careers outside Westminster politics. Yet as a collective, the team advising Keir Starmer ahead of the biggest test of his leadership is a new group acutely aware of the challenge it faces.\nThe best example of an old hand thrown into a new challenge is Sam White, Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, who has only had a fortnight in the job and has been brought in to bring some organisation and order to the leader\u2019s office.\nWhile White had worked within Labour as a special adviser to Alistair Darling in the Treasury, he had built a lucrative career in the private sector before arriving in the post. He had previously been drafted in to help Starmer respond to the Covid-19 pandemic last year. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, well-organised \u2013 not the sort of person you often meet in politics,\u201d said an insider.\nDeborah Mattinson, a pollster who worked for Brown, arrived over the summer as head of strategy and has been trying to keep Starmer focused on the issues that occupy the thoughts of key voters, such as work, crime and the cost of living. She has found an ally in Claire Ainsley, the director of policy, who has not previously worked for the party.\nAinsley has been hugely influential in shaping a focus on what she calls a \u201cnew working class\u201d, a diverse group of low and middle-income workers whose support Labour has been losing for decades. They are central to Starmer\u2019s speech.\nIt is the involvement of figures closely associated with the Blair era, however, that has provoked the strongest reaction from the Labour left. Matthew Doyle, made acting communications chief over the summer, has now been given the role permanently. He stuck with Blair after the former prime minister left office and was involved in Liz Kendall\u2019s failed leadership challenge in 2015.\nMeanwhile Philip Collins, Blair\u2019s former speechwriter, has been involved in refining Starmer\u2019s address. It has led to fierce accusations from the left that the ultimate Blair-era strategist, Peter Mandelson, has gained significant influence inside Starmer\u2019s office.\nWhile insiders deny that Starmer has simply co-opted figures from a previous era, they blame an unfortunate Labour dynamic for reaching for those involved in helping past party leaders. It has been so long since Labour won, they say, it is hardly surprising that there was a demand for people with experience of winning and governing.\nIn fact, there is a survivor from the Jeremy Corbyn era. Deputy chief of staff Helene Reardon-Bond, a former senior civil servant, was initially hired by Corbyn and remains part of the senior team.\nOther key figures include Luke Sullivan, a longtime Labour staffer from the whips\u2019 office, with strong ties to Labour MPs and regarded as a political problem-solver. Insiders said he was among those who had the task of sorting out the row over potential rule changes.\nPaul Ovenden, the deputy communications chief, had the job of helping to draft Starmer\u2019s recent essay and has also been helping on the speech. Others having an impact are said to include Stuart Ingham, the deputy director of policy, who is seen as a wonk who can talk human.\nIn terms of political allies, Rachel Reeves has more influence than many realise and is often \u201cin the room\u201d with Starmer for important decisions, particularly when political calculations come into play. Starmer is said to listen carefully to his shadow chancellor.",

        "content": "In June 1940, a Dutch salesman, acting as a consul in Lithuania, issued Jewish refugees with pseudo visas to escape Europe. His remarkable story is only now being told\nHe helped save more Jewish lives than Oskar Schindler, but while the brave deeds of the German industrialist were known around the world because of an Oscar-winning film, few know the name Jan Zwartendijk, a Dutch radio salesman who helped thousands of Jews flee Nazi-occupied Europe.\nNow a book by the celebrated Dutch writer Jan Brokken seeks to rescue Zwartendijk from obscurity, as well as other courageous officials who bent the rules to help several thousand Jews trapped between Nazi Europe and the Soviet Union.\nThe Just, published this year in English, recounts how up to 10,000 men, women and children fled the Holocaust. At the heart of the story is Zwartendijk and the Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara, who improvised an improbable escape route from Lithuania to the Japanese port of Tsuruga and beyond. Over 10 frantic days in the summer of 1940, the two men issued \u201cvisas\u201d to 2,139 people. Researchers estimate 6,000 to 10,000 may have escaped, as women and children often travelled on male relatives\u2019 documents.\nYet while Sugihara became a national hero, featuring on Japan\u2019s school curriculum and with three museums dedicated to his life, Zwartendijk was forgotten. His youngest son, a baby in the Lithuanian years, knew nothing of his father\u2019s actions until he was in his 30s. \u201cHe never spoke about this period,\u201d said Rob Zwartendijk, 81, speaking to the Observer from the North Holland town of Blaricum.\n\u201cAnd whenever it cropped up, he said: \u2018Ah, that\u2019s not very important, everyone would have done those things if they had been in this position\u2019. Which you and I know is not true.\u201d\nJan Zwartendijk was an accidental diplomat. When war broke out in 1939, he was head of the local Philips branch in Kaunas, then the capital of Lithuania, which sold radios, gramophones and lightbulbs. Life was good. He was happily married with three children and a secondhand Buick in the drive.\nAs a reliable company man, Zwartendijk was asked by the Dutch government in exile to step into the unpaid position of consul in Kaunas, as the previous occupant was suspected of Nazi sympathies. Expecting only to assist a few Dutch citizens, Zwartendijk was soon confronted with a dangerous choice. He was not a born hero, writes Brokken, but made a snap decision to help Jewish refugees who came knocking at his door: they had fled to Lithuania after the Nazi invasion of neighbouring Poland in September 1939.\nDuring the second world war, Lithuania suffered a double occupation by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany but, for nearly 10 months, Kaunas was a free city. Dubbed the \u201cCasablanca of the north\u201d, it was a nest for spies and haven for refugees fleeing both Nazis and Soviets.\nThat changed when the Red Army invaded Lithuania on 15 June 1940. Jewish refugees began searching desperately for a way out. Approached by a couple of refugees with a plan, Zwartendijk agreed to write in their passports that no travel document was required to travel to the Dutch Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao. This was technically true, but withheld the detail that permission from the island\u2019s governor was required. Zwartendijk was counting on no one checking the entry requirements for a tiny island on the other side of the world. And nobody did. This pseudo visa unlocked the door to leaving. Armed with the \u201cCura\u00e7ao visa\u201d, Jewish refugees could petition Sugihara \u2013 and the foreign-currency hungry Soviet authorities \u2013 for transit papers. Word about \u201cMister Radio Philips\u201d began to spread.\nAlthough they lived less than 300 metres apart, Zwartendijk and Sugihara never met. But they spoke on the phone sometimes. Sugihara urged his Dutch colleague to slow down issuing visas. While Zwartendijk wrote his visa with a fountain pen and green-ink stamp, Sugihara composed his with more laborious ink and brush. Both ran a huge risk. Sugihara defied his bosses in Tokyo, while Zwartendijk would have been in mortal danger had the Nazis found out when he returned to his occupied home country.\nThey also risked the attention of the Soviet police, who noticed long queues outside the Philips office that served as the Dutch consulate. One evening, Zwartendijk received a visit from a Russian officer, who ordered soldiers to block the pavement to the office. Accusing Zwartendijk of endangering public safety, he threatened to close the consulate immediately. The Dutchman offered him a Philishave, the brand-new electric razor the company had introduced in 1939. Given a quick demonstration of the gadget, the officer declared it a miracle and let Zwartendijk carry on.\nWhen Zwartendijk returned to the Nazi-occupied Netherlands in September 1940, the reasons for secrecy were obvious. Yet, long after the war, when the scale of the Holocaust was well known, Zwartendijk was never feted. In 1964, he was even reprimanded by the Dutch foreign ministry after a newspaper report about the mysterious \u201cAngel of Cura\u00e7ao\u201d emerged. Brokken suggests that Zwartendijk\u2019s heroism may have shamed his contemporaries.\nZwartendijk was furious about the reprimand, but he was tormented by not knowing how many had escaped on his Cura\u00e7ao visas. In later years, in failing health, he never stopped asking what became of the people who had stood before him in that light-brown panelled office in Kaunas. His son thinks his father feared none had made it beyond Siberia. \u201cHe must have thought that most of these people perished. He must have been worried that he sent them to their deaths.\u201d\nIn 1976, researchers assessed that 95% of Jewish refugees with Zwartendijk\u2019s papers survived the war. The news arrived at the Zwartendijk house the day after Jan\u2019s funeral.\nCertainly, for the Jewish refugees, the Cura\u00e7ao visa was no easy passport to freedom, but the start of a new painful odyssey. One recipient Jewish family, the Liwers, endured years of hardship, including, for the mother, Chawa, and daughter, Jadzia, forced labour making coffins in a Soviet camp and internment in the US for the father, Abraham.\nWhen the Nazis invaded Poland, the three fled their hometown of B\u0119dzin, where Abraham owned a bicycle parts factory. After months on the run and a toe lost to frostbite, Abraham eventually made it to Kaunas. But his wife and daughter, who had stayed in Lvov, were arrested by the Soviet secret police and sent to a camp in the Urals. When Abraham Liwer finally made it to Vladivostok, he went to the NKVD (secret police) office every day for two months to petition for their release. Arlette Liwer-Stuip, Abraham\u2019s granddaughter, thinks the local NKVD officer had a crush on him: \u201cShe enjoyed talking to him instead of having him arrested.\u201d Incredibly, his efforts paid off: Chawa and Jadzia were released and the family made it to Japan. After several years of further trials, they eventually settled in New York.\nFor Liwer-Stuip, who has written a 1,200-page family history, both Zwartendijk and Sugihara played a huge role in saving her grandparents and aunt. \u201cIt was easy to find out information about Sugihara, but I was having a hard time finding out much about Zwartendijk. The unfairness made it emotional for me, as I kept asking myself why was one so famous and the other virtually unknown?\u201d\n\u201cThere is room for two heroes,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cTo honour one and basically ignore the other for me doesn\u2019t ring like true history.\u201d\nSugihara died in 1986, two years after being recognised as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations\u201d \u2013 the highest honour accorded to non-Jews who risked everything to save Jewish lives. Zwartendijk was not given the same honour until 1997, a discrepancy that pained his family.\nRecognition is finally coming. In the Netherlands, in 2018, Brokken\u2019s book prompted an official apology to the Zwartendijk family, describing the 1964 reprimand as \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d. Last year, the then foreign minister, Stef Blok, praised Zwartendijk and Sugihara\u2019s \u201cextraordinary partnership\u201d, who \u201cat great personal risk dedicated themselves to humanity\u201d. Brokken\u2019s book has been translated into English and Italian and will be published in seven other languages, including French, Czech, Slovak and Russian. The author hopes to see an edition in Lithuanian. A previous publisher abandoned the book over objections to its recounting of mass murders committed by Lithuanian antisemitic paramilitaries.\nThe city of Kaunas has honoured Zwartendijk with a memorial in front of the Philips office. Suspended between trees is a spiral of 2,139 passports. When evening falls, the ever-changing colours \u2013 ocean blue, rose pink and forest green \u2013 light up the darkness.",

        "content": "A feud at Balliol College ended for ever when all five involved died in the first world war. Now the tale is to be told on the London stage\nIt was even more elitist than Oxford\u2019s Bullingdon Club, whose past members include Boris Johnson, David Cameron and George Osborne.\nThe Annandale Society, nicknamed the Anna, was made up exclusively of Old Etonians at Balliol College, Oxford, in the late 19th and early 20th century. They had their own table for meals, smashed crockery by throwing it down staircases, trashed the rooms of other undergraduates, whipped non-Balliol members out of the college grounds, and ritually abused, verbally and physically, some of their own fellow students.\nNow the story of five young men who attended the college shortly before the first world war \u2013 three Old Etonian members of the Anna and two non-Etonians \u2013 has been turned into a play, opening in London next month\nInto Battle conveys not just the feud between this trio of Balliol Old Etonians and the other two students, but the imminent war, in which, by a tragic coincidence, all five were killed.\nIt was also the name of a poem written by one Annandale member, Julian Grenfell, who \u2013 despite his thuggish behaviour at Oxford \u2013 was a poet of some note, being commemorated in Poets\u2019 Corner in Westminster Abbey. His poem Into Battle was a pro-war piece written in 1915 and was met with popular acclaim when published posthumously.\nThe idea for the play came after former advertising executive Hugh Salmon helped a friend research and publish a book about the England rugby union player Ronald Poulton, who captained his country in the final international before the first world war. Poulton, one of the non-Old Etonians in Salmon\u2019s drama, had also been at Balliol before the war.\n\u201cHe was not just an extremely talented player. As I dug around in archives and old books, and after talking to relatives, I found out about this extraordinary feud with the Eton crowd,\u201d said Salmon, whose own brother Jamie was \u2013 uniquely \u2013 capped for rugby by both England and New Zealand in the 1980s.\nSalmon\u2019s play concentrates on three particular Old Etonians: Grenfell, his younger brother Billy, who behaved the most boorishly, and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, president of the infamous Anna. Shaw-Stewart also became a war poet, best known for his verse Achilles in the Trench \u2013 also called I Saw a Man This Morning \u2013 which was found after his death in France in December 1917.\nThis trio despised the others at the college, whom they called \u201cplebs\u201d, and took it out on Poulton and, in particular, his close friend Keith Rae, who had been educated at home in Liverpool because of poor health. Rae was a Christian with very strong social convictions. He and Poulton were stalwarts of the Balliol Boys\u2019 Club, which had been set up to help underprivileged local youngsters.\nBut Rae and Poulton fumed at the appalling behaviour of the Annandale Society, including, according to Salmon, \u201cletting loose rabbits in a closed quad for a bulldog to kill them\u201d. On another occasion, they dressed up as prehistoric men, rampaging through college, breaking windows and hurling beds out of them.\n\u201cThe Grenfell brothers were particularly awful. This was bullying and not just high spirits. Billy really had it in for Keith Rae, insulting him and throwing his belongings out of his room, while Julian even used a whip to force a student from another college out of Balliol\u2019s grounds.\u201d\nBilly Grenfell was finally sent down for a year by the college, while Julian had to take a term off, returning to his family estate, where he lay for weeks on a sofa with a loaded rifle at his side.\nBy an extraordinary twist of fate, Rae and Billy Grenfell, sworn foes at Oxford, died fighting together in the same regiment against the common enemy of Germanyon 30 July 1915 in the trenches of Belgium, very close to Ypres.\n\u201cThe Annandale was finally closed down in the 1930s by the then left-leaning master of Balliol, Sandie Lindsay,\u201d said Seamus Perry, a Balliol English literature professor. Perry is also chairman of the Keith Rae Trust, which took over the role of the Balliol Boys\u2019 Club in the early 1920s.\n\u201cThe remains of Keith were never found, though his father Edward, devastated by the loss of his son, went searching,\u201d said Alistair Rae, a grandson of one of Edward\u2019s brothers and himself a trustee.\nEdward Rae, a stockbroker, was aware of his son\u2019s commitment to young people, and put up the money to establish a new trust. A century on, it still gives each year to boys\u2019 clubs and organisations around the UK.\nThis sort of financial support is particularly welcome today because government funding for boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 clubs has been severely cut back over the past decade. \u201cIn fact it has been decimated,\u201d said Andy Hamill, director of the National Association of Boys and Girls Clubs. \u201cWhile today there are more things, in principle, for youngsters to do, those who once joined youth clubs often came from more deprived backgrounds, and now don\u2019t have as much access to the full range of activities out there.\u201d\nInto Battle, which will run at the Greenwich theatre in south-east London, looks back at the extraordinary events of just over a century ago at one Oxford college. Today, Balliol points out how much it has changed. When Julian Grenfell first went there in 1906, he was one of 18 Old Etonians among its 53 freshers. Yet in 2020-21 there was just one from the intake of 137.",

        "content": "The death of Gabby Petito draws attention to a form of widespread gendered violence in the US that has long been hiding in plain sight\nThe last week of July, as Gabby Petito and her fiance, Brian Laundrie, posted Instagram photos of themselves hiking barefoot in Utah\u2019s Canyonlands national park, bronzed skin matching apricot-colored rocks, the body of Jerri Winters was discovered in Clinton Township, Michigan.\nHer boyfriend, Matthew Lewinski, immediately admitted to the police he strangled her last December, keeping her mutilated body in the basement of the home they shared for months.\nThe same week, down in Starkville, Mississippi, William Chisholm was convicted of capital murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend Dr Shauna Witt. One month following her breaking up with him, Chisholm stormed the Walmart eye clinic where Witt worked as an optometrist and shot her dead.\nOver in Baltimore, Maryland, Gomezgeka Chisala was that same week being held without bail after confessing to the killing of his ex-girlfriend Shaunya Green, a life-loving nurse and mother of two who once traveled to Africa to walk among elephants. Earlier in the month, Chisala had driven to Green\u2019s home with a gun, entered into an argument with her and shot her dead.\nYear after year, FBI statistics on nationwide homicides reveal that a vast proportion of women killed in the US are killed by current or former intimate partners. According to the CDC, homicide is the fourth leading cause of death for girls and women one to 19 years old, and the fifth leading cause of death for women 20 to 44.\nThe heart-wrenching confirmation that the remains of Petito had been found in Wyoming, and the search for Laundrie, deemed a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in what has now been ruled a homicide, begs for scrutiny not only the circumstances of Petito\u2019s devastating disappearance, but draws sorely needed attention to a form of widespread gendered deadly violence in the US that has long been hiding in plain sight.\nAccording to analysis of FBI data, of all female homicides accounted for in 2018 where the relationship between perpetrator and victim could be identified, 92% of cases involved women or girls killed by a man they knew, 63% of whom were killed by current husbands, ex-husbands or current boyfriends.\nThis puts confirmed American female intimate gendered killings happening at a staggering rate of almost three women every day. Those circumstances are drastically different to men\u2019s, who are killed by other men in three quarters of cases, and in over a quarter of cases by strangers.\nYet this particularity \u2013 and predictability \u2013 receives barely any attention domestically.\nWhile in France, the word femicide, or f\u00e9minicide, is now used as a way of describing the epidemic of women killed by men in intimate settings, the term is barely understood outside of niche circles in the US. This, in spite of the fact that there are 10 times more women killed in this way in this country than in France (1,014 confirmed intimate acquaintance killings of women in the US in 2018 compared to 120 that same year in France). Adjusting for population size, the problem is twice as bad in the US than it is in France.\nIn Turkey, where so-called \u201chonor killings\u201d are reportedly still practiced, and where the murder of a 27-year-old woman by her ex-boyfriend last summer sparked globally-covered protests, the rate of women killed is also below that of the US. There, 474 women were killed in 2019, compared to 2,991 women in the same year here. Even accounting for the fact that the US is four times larger in population than Turkey, the proportion of femicides here remains distinctly larger.\nWhen Americans do recognize the term femicide, they often think of it as a problem happening in other countries, or in already marginalized communities at home.\nThere is some merit to those thoughts. According to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls in the US is six times higher than it is for white women and girls, and 94% of cases are attributable to former or current partners. But the severity of this mostly flies under the radar. Half of Indigenous homicide reports are missing from FBI data, the center says, meaning many lives lost are ignored in much of the official counting.\nWhen Indigenous women are reported missing, less effort is put into finding them across the board, numbers suggest. In Wyoming, where the remains of Petito were found eight days after she was reported missing, white people are found in 81% of cases after a week of being declared missing, compared to only 61% of Indigenous people in the same timeframe \u2013 a difference of 20%.\nLaws protecting Indigenous rights in the US, which gives power to tribal courts and federal courts, but not state courts, can complicate matters too.\nAt the end of 2019, two months after 17-year-old Faith Lindsey went missing in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, her boyfriend, Tanner Washington, was arrested for first-degree murder by local authorities after being found with Lindsey\u2019s blood on his shoes, pants and phone. But charges were later dismissed because of the alleged crime happening on tribal land.\nWhile federal charges were brought this year, the trial has yet to happen, and Faith\u2019s body was never found \u2013 meaning she is yet another Indigenous woman unaccounted for in official femicide counts while her family awaits answers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard time because not knowing where she\u2019s at, not knowing if she\u2019s still here or if she\u2019s gone. We don\u2019t know,\u201d her sister Justice said last fall.\nWhile nationwide homicide data for 2020 and 2021 have yet to be released, anecdotal evidence suggests the problem got worse during the lockdowns associated with the Covid-19 epidemic.\nScott Colom, a district attorney in north-east Mississippi, tells me there has been an undeniable uptick in domestic violence incidents. In the last four months alone, in the relatively small four-county area he serves, where the population is about 140,000, three Black women have been killed, with current or former intimate partners facing charges. Their names were Lisa Brooks, Whitney Taylor and Kaliyah Brooks.\nOf all the women captured in FBI homicide data, Black women and girls are being murdered by male offenders at a rate of almost three times more than white women.\nColom says part of the problem is how the system addresses daily occurrences of domestic violence incidents before they turn lethal. He explains that with the strengthening of violence against women laws, including mandatory arrest laws, arrests are almost certain when someone is accused of domestic violence. But as the system focuses on arrests, charges and convictions, the victim\u2019s needs and wishes are paradoxically often brushed to the side.\nAs things stand, after a complaint or an arrest, there is no formal follow-up with an accuser, and in the months in between an arrest being made and them being bid to court, the accuser has very often dropped charges. This happens because the accuser may rely on the accused for money or housing, because he may be the father of her children, or because she is emotionally attached to him and doesn\u2019t want to be the cause for him going to jail.\nThis week, a middle-aged woman ended up in hospital having to undergo surgery in one of the counties Colom serves after her husband beat her with a crowbar. She was able to call her son during the incident to help de-escalate, but when investigators talked to her, she explained leaving him was not an option. She understood her husband was a threat to her, but she needed him to pay rent and couldn\u2019t afford a divorce.\n\u201cThis is a huge problem in our system: that we are not equipped to give her what we need for her to feel safe, and for her to have the ability to get away from this guy. There needs to be a lot more support for women who are victims of domestic abuse to help them get out of their situation,\u201d Colom says, adding that domestic violence response is \u201cone of the worst things we are doing in this system\u201d.\nSarah Fair George, a state\u2019s attorney in Vermont who serves a majority white, mostly middle-class constituency, explains that while domestic violence is one of their most common charges, it is also among the most complicated.\n\u201cThe dynamic of intimate partner violence is by its very name intimate. So there are very rarely witnesses, very rarely corroborating evidence. There\u2019s the complicated factor of control and manipulation, financial dependence, isolation \u2013 all of those types of things that come from being in an abusive relationship that make the proving something beyond a reasonable doubt difficult,\u201d George says.\nWhen considering reporting intimate partner violence, these factors play into account in accusers\u2019 minds who may be reluctant to either denounce or follow through on an accusation, while the person committing violence might take advantage of these factors, with the situation escalating.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why so many ultimately end up in this extreme of homicide. Because there\u2019s build up over time behind these closed walls. The person gets more and more violent without any intervention and it ends up being fatal.\u201d\nGeorge says it is \u201calarming\u201d to her that while Vermont\u2019s homicide rate is consistently in the single digits every year, she can think of three incidents of women being killed by current or former intimate partners in the last couple of years in her county alone.\nShe believes a more holistic approach is needed: one that would spend more time and resources on addressing the root problem, discouraging recidivism and truly listened to victims.\nColom agrees: advocating for a more reparative system in which counsellors would meet with victims, assess needs and wishes and provide immediate access to material support \u2013 including housing, money, or jobs. If women decided to stay, a more reparative system would focus on making the landing as safe as possible, working with men towards growth and change.\nBut there is barely any funding for these types of services \u2013 just federal funding for arrests and convictions.\nThe other, essential and consistently missing part of the puzzle precedes physical violence, and has more to do with power, and male entitlement over women.\n\u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been a problem with how men have been taught to view women. And some of that manifests itself in what we see with these murders,\u201d says Colom, who was the prosecutor in the case of the Walmart fatal shooting of the optometrist that involved two middle-class white people, and is quick to point out that \u201ctoxic masculinity does not know class, that\u2019s for sure\u201d.\n\u201cWhat I see is that they are treating women like their property. Like, \u2018This person belongs to me. If I can\u2019t have her, nobody can have her. If I am not happy, it\u2019s her fault.\u2019 It\u2019s a frame of mind of toxic masculinity that I see all the time,\u201d Colom says.\nTeaching men to get out of this frame of mind is crucial. Without doing this, we are left living in a country that has silently accepted femicide as a byproduct of its structure \u2013 to the extent that it doesn\u2019t even bother naming it.",

Board shorts with the Lidl logo sold for \u00a34.99, socks were \u00a31.49 and bags were 99p.\nOne seller, Alfie Hayward from the West Midlands, said that he initially bought a couple of pairs of the trainers but went back and stocked up when he realised they would be popular.\n\u201cAll the shoes sold out in about three days,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cI had about 30 pairs of trainers, so about 10 pairs a day sold. That\u2019s not to mention the socks \u2013 which sold even quicker.\u201d\nTo the untrained eye, the range may be brash and garish but it appears to have tapped into the 90s nostalgia trend especially popular among young people and students.\nThis is not the cut-price retailer\u2019s first foray into the world of fashion. It has sold unbranded clothing since 2014 and last year dipped its toe into branded fashion with its successful Christmas jumper also featuring the Lidl logo.\nThe German discount supermarket would not comment on why its trainers were proving so popular or whether there are plans to bring the branded clothing back.",

A misty, blurry view of lush farmland accompanied by childlike chatter is seen through the inflated skin of two \u201cballoons\u201d, which are revealed to be two blown-up condoms. This mix of tranquillity, playfulness and a touch of melancholy becomes the evocative thread that runs through this leisurely film where opposing doctrines are explored in a fascinating, non-didactic fashion.\nRevolving around a ram-rearing family headed by two patriarchs, the film is, at first, deceptively male-centric. Dargye (Jinpa), the husband, talks often of buying virile stock for breeding. Staying in the background, his wife, Drolkar (Sonam Wangmo), is smilingly docile \u2013 yet her character slowly becomes the film\u2019s central figure, and the site of contrasting credos. As the couple already have three children, Drolkar is dismayed to discover that she\u2019s pregnant again. She feels pressure to get an abortion since mainland China has imposed family planning on its population, which includes contested areas such as Tibet. On the other hand, her husband\u2019s Buddhist beliefs dictate that his recently deceased father is now reincarnated inside Drolkar\u2019s womb.\nWhile armed with plenty of social critique, the beauty of Balloon goes beyond this tug-of-war between modernity and tradition. The narrative is full of circles, from the cheeky balloons to the round, reflective surface of a filled washbasin on which Drolkar dreamily catches a glimpse of her younger self. Instead of providing simplistic answers to Drolkar\u2019s dilemma, Balloon ends on a note of enigmatic wonder as the characters witness a spectacle among the clouds. The moment is spiritual and transformative, as if real-life problems have also leapt into thin air.\n Balloon is released on 24 September in cinemas.",

In an emotional interview in Saturday\u2019s Daily Mail, Neil, 72, claims that he tried to delay the launch of the new channel because it was not ready. But his experience as chairman of Sky in the late 1980s was ignored, he claims.\n\u201cAt Sky, we\u2019d had three weeks of rehearsals before going on air. GB News barely had a week, and there were so many hitches with the technology. The CEO wanted to get on air, even if it was ramshackle, and then improve things,\u201d said Neil.\nThe veteran journalist also says he warned of the dangers of the channel\u2019s novel ideas about creating content, including an abortive scheme to put covert cameras inside school classrooms to expose the supposed leftwing bias of teachers.\n\u201cI said: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea but I think you should take charge of that yourself, and after you get in hot water for breaking about five different laws \u2013 including filming minors \u2013 come back and talk to me,\u201d says Neil, who remains chairman of the Spectator.\nTweeting before publication of the interview on Friday, Neil, who edited the Sunday Times for a decade, said that having \u201cto revisit terrible, unnecessary times\u201d had been \u201cquite distressing\u201d but that it was \u201cgood to get the truth out, at last\u201d.\nWhile Neil\u2019s critics are unsympathetic \u2013 several using social media to reach for their metaphoric \u201ctiny violins\u201d \u2013 the picture of chaos now painted at the news channel lifts the lid on a media project that aimed to alter the landscape of British television. Much of Neil\u2019s attack centres on the technical obstacles that faced presenters from the moment the channel went live. Lighting failures, sound glitches and a dysfunctional set were just the visible signs of a general lack of preparedness, he believes.\nO\u2019Brien argues that Neil himself made two further \u201crather massive and eminently avoidable mistakes\u201d. \u201cHe failed to understand that live television could not camouflage the vapidity and nastiness of anti-woke rhetoric with fancy language and faux intellectualism, in the way that the Spectator does,\u201d he told the Observer.\n\u201cFinally, and most fatally for the whole humiliating adventure, he believed that everybody else would share his own unfeasibly high opinion of himself.\u201d\nNeil has left the chairman\u2019s seat on the GB News board and a \u00a34m contract with the channel, which is run by former Sky News Australia chief Angelos Frangopoulos, claiming it \u201cwould have killed me\u201d to carry on.\nGB News, founded by businessmen Andrew Cole and Mark Schneider to challenge established British news providers, argues that Neil\u2019s interview and his appearance on BBC\u2019s Question Time 10 days ago have broken his legal exit agreement. Neil claims in turn that his former employers showed bad faith by briefing against him to the newspapers.\nThe pain of working there brought the Scottish journalist to the point of breakdown: \u201cBy the end of that first week, I knew I had to get out.

Emergency measures to allow 5,000 foreign truck drivers into the country to help were approved by the cabinet on Friday, after a split about whether to ease post-Brexit immigration rules.\nPlaying down the threat of a lack of fuel, Shapps said there were no supply problems at the six refineries and 47 storage facilities across the UK, and he turned his ire on some motorists, telling them to \u201cbe sensible\u201d.\n\u201cThe most important thing is, if people carry on as they normally would and fill up their cars as they normally would, then you won\u2019t have queues and you won\u2019t have shortages at the pump either,\u201d he told Sky News\u2019 Trevor Philips on Sunday show.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have fuel in the country. We do need to just ensure people are filling up when they need to fill up, rather than thinking I\u2019d better go and fill up now just in case I need it next week or the week after.\u201d\nShapps was hopeful the situation would resolve itself quickly and not last as long as the panic-buying seen during the first lockdown. \u201cSooner or later, everyone\u2019s cars will be more or less filled up and there won\u2019t be anywhere else to put fuel,\u201d he said, adding that it was unlike the stockpiling of toilet roll last March.\nShapps blamed \u201cone of the road haulage associations\u201d for leaking details about heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver shortages at fuel firms, saying that had \u201chelped to spark a crisis\u201d that had proved \u201cvery, very unhelpful\u201d.\nHe claimed the leak came from a meeting about 10 days ago and that one of the attenders briefed the details to the press. \u201cThat has created, as we\u2019ve seen, quite a large degree of concern,\u201d the transport secretary said. \u201cPeople naturally react to those things.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands Shapps was referring to a briefing between industry stakeholders and Whitehall officials last week. It was a regularly scheduled gathering, designed for businesses to flag issues privately with the government, but BP\u2019s admission about its HGV driver shortage was passed on to ITV News and reported within 48 hours.\nShapps defended the announcement that only 5,000 visas would be issued for foreign HGV drivers to stem the crisis, saying it was not a UK-specific problem and that he was also appealing for 1 million workers who hold an HGV licence \u2013 some of whom have retired, fallen out of work or switched jobs \u2013 to return.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the number of visas to be issued was \u201cfar, far too small\u201d and up to 100,000 were needed \u2013 equal to about the size of a small city. \u201cWe have to issue enough visas to cover the number of drivers that we need,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. Starmer admitted it was \u201cnot an ideal response, it\u2019s a short-term response\u201d to the immediate crisis.\nHe accused ministers of a \u201clack of planning\u201d, adding: \u201cWe knew in particular that when we exited the EU there would be a need for a backup plan to deal with the situation and there\u2019s no plan from the government on this.\u201d",

A large number of Germans were still believed to be undecided even in the hours ahead of polling day.\nDue to the pandemic, about 40% \u2013 a record number \u2013 of voters have already cast their ballot in a postal vote.\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, the president, said Germany faced a \u201cpolitical transition\u201d and urged citizens to use their vote to determine \u201chow the country continues to deal with both the small and large questions of our time\u201d.\n\u201cDemocracy thrives on intervention and participation. Those who participate will be heard. Those who don\u2019t vote are allowing others to decide for them,\u201d he wrote in a guest commentary for the Bild am Sontag tabloid.\nThe climate emergency has been a key topic during the campaign, with activists at Fridays for Future demonstrations across the country on Friday appealing to a new government to put tackling the global climate crisis at the top of its agenda. Ahead of polls opening, two remaining campaigners from a group that had been on hunger strike in a camp next to the Bundestag since 30 August called off their strike after Scholz agreed to a public meeting with them in four weeks\u2019 time.\nThe polls opened at 88,000 voting stations around the country at 8am and will close at 6pm, with the first exit polls due to be published at the same time.\nThe lead candidates are due to hold a so-called \u201cElephant Round\u201d, a live round-table TV debate about the future make-up of the government, at 8.15pm local time.\nBut clarity is not expected even once the final results are known. A coalition government is an inevitability, but for the first time in more seven decades it is expected to be made up of three parties, leading to months of complicated and heated negotiations between them.\nMerkel will stay in office in a caretaker role until the new government takes power, which could take weeks or even months.\nThe party that achieves the best result will not automatically lead the government but will have to court the runners-up to join them in power. The Green party, which has previously shared power with the Social Democrats in national government, is expected to be a key kingmaker, along with the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP), which has traditionally been a natural partner for the conservative alliance.\nThe most likely coalitions are:\nA traffic-light coalition \u2013 reflecting the parties\u2019 trademark colours \u2013 between the SPD, Greens and FDP.\nA Jamaica alliance (the parties\u2019 colours matching those of the Jamaican flag) made up of the CDU/CSU, Greens and FDP.\nOr a so-called \u2018Red-Red-Green\u2019 coalition between the SPD, Greens and the far-left Die Linke.\nUnder Germany\u2019s proportional representation system, each voter has two votes. The first is for a direct candidate in one of the 299 constituencies that gives each district parliamentary representation.\nThe second vote is for a party and determines the composition of the Bundestag.\nParties must secure 5% of votes to be able to enter the Bundestag.\nThe size of the future parliament will only be determined once the votes are in, after adjustments are made to allow for the difference between the number of directly elected representatives and the results of the second vote to be taken into account.\nBut due to the number of direct candidates on track to win, it is expected the Bundestag could rise from the current all-time high of 709 seats to as many as 900. Election analysts have predicted a \u201chorror scenario\u201d that will not only be a challenge for those who have to organise the furniture but lead to an explosion in costs as well as complicating parliamentary business.\nUnder new rules, among those eligible to vote for the first time are 85,000 people with disabilities who will be allowed to enter the voting booth accompanied by a legal guardian.",

Aspects of this updating feel clumsy, with characters explaining the social, political and economic conditions of the day to one another, too often sounding more like pamphlets than people. The dynamics are weakened by a reworking of the relationships. Gone is the love/sex triangle between daughter of the house, Miss Julie, the servant John, and his fiancee, fellow servant Christine (severe and snooping Catrin Aaron), who is translated into a grieving war widow, surrogate mother to John. The dramatic form, veering away from tragedy, ricochets between thesis play and melodrama (highlighted in Jasmin Kent Rodgman\u2019s sometimes intrusive sound design, as when piano tinkles and strings swell loudly during Julie and John\u2019s onstage lovemaking).\nThe adaptation, as with the Strindberg, has Julie\u2019s character shaped by the conflicting influences of her traditionalist father and feminist mother. Georgia Lowe\u2019s design emblematises this conflict: Julie\u2019s upper body is fitted with tailored jacket, shirt and tie, while below her waist a ruffled maxi-skirt floats and flounces. On her entrance into the kitchen, flushed from dancing at the servants\u2019 May Day celebration, Julie flies towards John, hands grasping for him like claws \u2013 she will later be compared to a red kite (an impressively intense performance by Heledd Gwynn). John, no longer Julie\u2019s father\u2019s valet, is now a boot boy who moves on crutches, having lost the lower part of one leg in an accident before the war (one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s aims as a playwright is to present the lived experience of disability on stage). John\u2019s rapacious self-centredness is lessened; his attitudes more politicised (in Tim Pritchett\u2019s measured, soft-voiced portrayal).\nThe passion between Julie and John is credible, the impediments to its continuation less so: opportunities for women in the UK in 1922 were few, but more than Julie, here, supposes. At the close of the action she is \u2013 as in the original \u2013 incapable of deciding what to do with her life unless instructed by a man. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s adaptation, in Chelsea Walker\u2019s staging, leaves the problematic misogyny at the core of Strindberg\u2019s play disappointingly intact.\n Missing Julie is at Theatr Clwyd, Mold, until 9 October",

        "content": "Hangar 1 collaborated with Crimson Wine group to salvage Napa-grown fruit for a specialty vodka with charitable intentions\n\nWhen the haze from last year\u2019s Glass fire settled over Napa Valley, all seemed lost for the region\u2019s grapes. Most were tinged with ash and smoke before they could be pulled from the vines, rendering them useless for winemaking. But it gave a spirit distillery in nearby Alameda an idea.\nHangar 1, which specializes in crafting sustainable and locally sourced spirits, reached out to their partners at an affected winery to see if they could turn the wasted grapes into vodka.\n\u201cWe came in and said let\u2019s work together and salvage this situation,\u201d said Hangar 1 distiller Eric Lee, who helps run the craft spirits distillery. \u201cWe wanted to figure out how to upcycle what would normally be going down the drain and turn it into something awesome.\u201d\nThis month, Hangar 1 released the results of that collaboration: a limited edition Smoke Point vodka distilled from Napa-grown malbec and merlot grapes. The resulting liquor has a sweet and spicy finish, smooth enough to sip with subtle notes of fruit, licorice and allspice. It\u2019s also an innovative approach to an intractable problem. The new vodka is one of several solutions being tested as vintners adapt to a future where the risks of ruined grapes run higher every year.\nThe companies are donating 100% of the proceeds from the product to the California Fire foundation as a gesture of appreciation to firefighters and to raise awareness of the wildfire\u2019s impact. \u201cWe are not looking to make money on this,\u201d said Nicolas Quill\u00e9, the chief winemaking and operations officer at Crimson Wine group, which supplied the grapes to Hanger 1. \u201cWe were extremely affected and we were looking for ways to say thank you, to a community that helped us so much.\u201d\nBut there is a secondary motivation too.\n\u201cThere is definitely another layer to this besides just let\u2019s do something good and make lemonade out of all those lemons,\u201d Quill\u00e9 said \u2013 namely that this was a chance to explore novel ways to use smoke-affected grapes that otherwise would have gone down the drain.\nVodka can be made of any sugar or starch-laden food that ferments, according to Lee, and is traditionally made from grains or potatoes. But Hangar 1 had already been using grapes in their signature vodka and they aren\u2019t the only distillery to use the fruit as a base, which gives the vodka a unique character and taste profile. But they are the first to put smoke-tinged wine grapes to use that otherwise would have gone to waste. The result has been a resounding success.\nSmoky spirits \u2013 like some whiskeys, scotch and mezcal \u2013 have risen in popularity in recent years. But the flavors in those alcohols are carefully crafted to appeal to the palate, whereas smoke-tainted grapes, Quill\u00e9 said, can run the risk of taking on a far-less appealing profile \u2013 more akin to a cold ashtray than something savory.\nBut in the vodka, any residual smokiness was left behind during distillation and the final result came out with a clean flavor with hints of fruit, vanilla and honey.\n\u201cA lot of people think vodka is supposed to be totally flavorless and totally aromaless,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are really learning that you can tell the difference between the base materials.\u201d\nThe fermented grape juice \u2013 which wasn\u2019t yet finished wine but was about 12% alcohol \u2013 started as the base. The distillation process brought it up to 95% alcohol, a legal requirement for the end product to be considered vodka. \u201cWe start out with a very deep, dark red wine and what we got is totally perfectly clear and very high proof,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThen that\u2019s what we blend down to bottling strength, which for us is 40% or 80-proof.\u201d\nThe resulting batch turned out 4,800 bottles, which retail for $50 each, or can be fashioned into martinis at the distillery tasting room, where visitors can imbibe while looking out on the San Francisco skyline across the bay. This run is a limited edition, but there\u2019s plenty of possibility for another round in the future.\nClimate change has increased both the size and intensity of fires burning in the west where winemakers and growers once flourished. The blazes are just one of the environmental threats being felt by the industry and Quill\u00e9, of Crimson Wine Group, said they will have to adapt. So far this year they have been largely spared the smoke but the region has been mired in drought. The dry conditions have roughly halved crop yields. \u201cSo there won\u2019t be much wine made this year,\u201d he said.\nHe and others are upgrading infrastructure to develop better water resiliency and efficiency. Quill\u00e9 said he is also working with researchers to develop advanced warning systems and predictive smoke modeling that will provide intelligence on when and how smoke becomes a threat. He hopes that will give growers the information they need to make decisions that limit exposure.\nThey have also been considering whether smoky grapes can still turn out good wine \u2013 just with a unique flavor profile. \u201cIs there a style of wine that could be done that would be a new product that currently does not exist and would find an audience, rather than trying to fight it?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one area of research.\u201d\nQuill\u00e9 is hopeful about the promise that\u2019s offered by the vodka collaboration and the potential for a new pathway out of the disaster.\n\u201cClimate change may make the wine industry more challenging,\u201d he said, adding that there will probably still be consequences and perhaps consolidation in the industry. \u201cBut we will find a solution.\u201d",

        "content": "With Britain facing multiple challenges, Keir Starmer\u2019s party is right to promise prudence\nLabour is not much cop at winning elections. In its entire history, the party has won only five elections with a comfortable majority. The brutal truth is that Labour should be good at opposition because it has plenty of practice at it.\nJust about every political pundit has advice for Sir Keir Starmer on how to avoid a fifth successive defeat, an outcome that would be dismal even by Labour\u2019s own standards. To win, it is said, Labour needs to be seen as a solid government-in-waiting but also have radical policies to put before the public. It must challenge the Tories for the support of older voters while appealing to the young; and win back Brexit supporters in former \u201cred wall\u201d seats while at the same time hanging on to those who backed remain in 2016. There are, no question, easier jobs than being the leader of the opposition.\nUltimately, the crucial thing is that Labour is trusted to run the economy because unless it can demonstrate a basic level of competence voters will support the other lot, even if they have no real affinity with the Conservatives. That\u2019s why the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will stress in her speech at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton on Monday that a Starmer-led government would tax fairly and spend wisely. Reeves\u2019s message will be that the foundations of the economy are weak and need to be repaired. The danger is that promising prudence comes across as bland.\nBeing trusted is not the same as being rightwing. Clement Attlee had a radical programme in 1945 and was considered a safe pair of hands. But Attlee had been deputy prime minister during the war, a period when he was effectively in charge of the home front and when the domestic economy was being run along quasi-socialist lines anyway.\nTony Blair won three elections, in 1997, 2001 and 2005, and the lesson he draws from that hat-trick of victories is that Labour has to occupy the centre ground in order to defeat the Tories. Starmer faces a tougher challenge, though, because by the time Blair became Labour leader in 1994, John Major\u2019s government was in deep trouble. Britain had crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday, taxes had gone up, what was left of the coalmining industry had been shut down, and the Tories were mired in sleaze. Blair\u2019s safety first approach was in part ideological but in part because there was no need to take any chances. He had it all to lose.\nOnce in power in 1997, Labour had a programme for change even if it did not involve public ownership or higher taxes on the rich. A minimum wage was introduced. Sure Start centres were opened. Child benefit was increased, new schools were built in poor communities and tax credits came in to boost the incomes of those on low incomes. Today it would be called levelling up, although the plan had rather more substance.\nTo be sure, the Blair governments made mistakes: some of them \u2013 such as a far too cosy relationship with the City that left the banks too lightly regulated \u2013 serious ones that would come to haunt the party during the subsequent financial crisis.\nBut Labour\u2019s record in power challenges the idea that the British public is intrinsically rightwing. There is no real evidence that this is the case. Voters like the furlough scheme, detest the idea that the NHS should be privatised, welcomed the nationalisation of the railways, have no time for tax dodgers and think it is unfair that the \u00a320-a-week uplift to universal credit is being withdrawn. All things considered, the public is actually quite receptive to ideas that would normally be considered leftwing.\nIt is also instructive to revisit the record of Harold Wilson, the only other Labour prime minister to win big, although again not quite for the reasons normally stated. The conventional take on Wilson is that he surfed the zeitgeist of the mid-1960s, fusing concerns about Britain\u2019s relative economic under-performance with a effort to modernise the country using the \u201cwhite heat\u201d of technology.\nWilson\u2019s plans went awry soon after he won his landslide victory in 1966, with the government knocked off course first by deflation and then by devaluation. But as Gavin Kelly, a former aide to Gordon Brown, noted in a recent blog, Wilson did more to flesh out his white heat rhetoric than he is usually given credit for.\nIn particular, the Labour government of the 1960s understood that modernisation and improving Britain\u2019s weak productivity record required both a top-down and bottom-up approach. It meant not just more professional management but workers happy to move from declining sectors to the dynamic parts of the economy. The Wilson government brought in a system of earnings-related unemployment benefits to make the transition to new jobs easier and to try to make the UK workforce less scared of change.\nAs Kelly points out, the idea worked despite serious flaws both in design and implementation. There was a 44% increase in labour reallocation between industrial sectors in the decade after 1968, surpassing all other decades of the 20th century other than those including the world wars.\nToday, Britain has to cope with the challenges of the pandemic, Brexit, the net zero transition, the digital revolution and the growing importance of artificial intelligence. It does so at a time when \u2013 as Kelly rightly says \u2013 \u201clabour market dynamism, geographic mobility and workforce training are all significantly lower than they were at the turn of the millennium\u201d.\nBritain is clearly not match fit to meet the challenges of the 2020s and that is something Labour should be looking to remedy.",

        "content": "Academic modelling estimates removal of \u00a320-a-week uplift will result in explosion in child poverty\nAbout 1,500 additional UK children a year would be removed from their families and taken into care as a result of the explosion in child poverty caused by the removal of the \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift, a study has predicted.\nThe impact of the cut on already struggling families would drive a 5% increase in children in care and see 5,500 extra children placed on child protection plans, with thousands more formally classified as \u201cin need\u201d after being referred to social services.\nAcademic modelling estimates the extra cost to councils of increased safeguarding services would be \u00a3100m a year at a time when local authorities are already failing to fund growing numbers of children taken into care during the pandemic.\nPoverty is closely linked with increases in parental stress, mental illness, and domestic violence, all risk factors for child protection intervention. The study estimates that 290,000 UK children currently live in households that will fall below the poverty line once the uplift, worth \u00a31,050 a year, is withdrawn.\nResearchers urged ministers to abandon their plans to cut universal credit from next month to ease growing pressures on low-income households. With national insurance rises and soaring food and energy bills, some families could be as much as \u00a31,750 a year worse off by April.\n\u201cPut simply, it is more difficult to keep children safe from adversity if families are living in material hardship. Poverty affects children directly and causes toxic stress within families, putting them at increased risk,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author David Taylor-Robinson, professor of public health and policy at the University of Liverpool.\nHe added: \u201cThe ongoing dramatic rise in children in care is already leading to unsustainable pressures on local authority budgets. To have any chance of \u2018levelling-up\u2019 it is essential that families with children are protected from the damaging impacts of child poverty.\u201d\nAlthough the government is reportedly looking at ways to mitigate the impact of the \u00a320 cut on some claimants, the researchers said this would have a \u201cmarginal\u201d effect and do little to shield claimants from the consequences of a large and sudden shock to household incomes.\nJosh MacAlister, the head of the ongoing government-commissioned review of children\u2019s social care, said he would carefully examine the findings of the research. The review\u2019s interim report published in June confirmed a causal link between poverty and rising levels of child abuse and neglect.\n\u201cPoverty creates stress in its own right as well as making families less resilient to other shocks and struggles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst welfare is not in the scope of this review, we recognise that increases in poverty have spending consequences for children\u2019s social care.\u201d\nCharlotte Ramsden, the president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services, said: \u201cThat the new research shows the removal of the \u00a320 universal credit uplift could have such a direct and dramatic impact on the number of children being subject to a child protection plan or entering care, should reinforce the need for urgent action.\n\u201cWhilst care is the right place to be for some children, pursuing policies that will knowingly exacerbate the difficulties families face and even tip them into crisis seems very far removed from the promises of levelling up the country.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have put in place unprecedented welfare support and ensured vulnerable children and families have been able to access this. Helping people back into work is the best way to end the cycle of poverty \u2013 that\u2019s why our multibillion-pound Plan for Jobs is focused on helping them learn new skills, increase their hours or find new jobs.\n\u201cWe have invested millions in the frontline charities directly supporting vulnerable children, and we\u2019re championing family hubs where parents can get vital services for their children from infancy up to age 19. Our Innovation Programme is exploring new ways to improve outcomes for children in or at risk of care, and the independent review of children\u2019s social care is looking at how to reform the system \u2013 including how to support families to stay together safely.\u201d",

        "content": "Critics say Biden\u2019s national security adviser should have considered the worst case scenario \nOn the afternoon of 30 August, a White House aide brought a note into the Oval Office confirming that the last US military plane had left Afghan airspace, marking the moment America\u2019s longest war had come to an end.\nJoe Biden was with a team of advisers and on receiving the news he asked two of them, secretary of state Tony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, to accompany him to his private dining room to mark the moment with a call to the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin.\nBlinken has been a constant presence at Biden\u2019s side since 2002. By contrast, before he joined the 2020 campaign, Sullivan had worked for Biden for just 18 months, and that was six years earlier as the then vice-president\u2019s national security adviser. His whole career on the national stage before then had been as Hillary Clinton\u2019s right hand man.\nThe 30 August phone call \u2013 at the president\u2019s side, at the end of two decades of war \u2013 was confirmation that he had arrived as a true Biden insider.\n\u201cIt was a significant moment and the president wanted Jake to be there,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him turn to Jake for advice on both domestic and foreign policy over the last two years. He has enormous respect for Jake\u2019s judgment and relies on him intently.\u201d\nBeing held close by the president made Sullivan a lead protagonist in a historic moment, but it also put him at centre stage when the blame was hurled for the chaotic and humiliating nature of its final scenes, particularly as it was Sullivan who was sent out to explain the policy on the television talk shows.\nThe national security adviser is responsible for ensuring all legitimate points of view are aired in the situation room, and all scenarios are examined. But the Biden administration as a whole was taken by surprise by the catastrophic speed of the Afghan army\u2019s collapse.\nEight months into his job, there have been calls for Sullivan\u2019s resignation, and not just from Republicans. Brett Bruen, who was director of global engagement in the Obama White House, went as far as writing a commentary for USA Today calling for a shake-up in Biden\u2019s national security team, starting with Sullivan.\nThe White House has vigorously defended Sullivan, arguing that no one around the table in the situation room had predicted how fast Kabul would fall, and stressed the national security adviser\u2019s role in coordinating the evacuation of 124,000 civilians, the biggest civilian airlift in US history.\nAged just 44, Sullivan is the youngest national security adviser American has had since McGeorge Bundy counseled John F Kennedy 60 years ago. Everyone interviewed for this article, fan and critic alike, used some variant of \u201cold head on young shoulders\u201d to describe him, saying he was sufficiently secure in himself to be unfailingly polite and thoughtful to those around him.\n\u201cDespite being probably one of the smartest people in the building, he\u2019s not somebody who has walled off his process. He\u2019s really interested in hearing what others bring to the table,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, said.\nSullivan has changed the nature of the President\u2019s Daily Brief, the morning update from the intelligence community, widening the circle of people involved by bringing in more top officials to participate according to their expertise.\nSullivan is not a natural-born creature of Washington. He gave up lucrative opportunities in the capital early in his career to spend more time in Minnesota, where he grew up, and now that he spends almost every waking hour in the White House, he is said to pine for the home he has made in New Hampshire with his wife, Maggie Goodlander, a former adviser to independent (formerly Democratic) senator Joe Lieberman, and the late Republican senator, John McCain.\nOne of Sullivan\u2019s themes in the job is connecting US actions on the world stage to the lives and welfare of ordinary Americans, with the mantra of \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class\u201d.\nA second, overlapping priority has been to finally drag the focus of foreign policy away from the Middle East and counter-terrorism. The withdrawal from Afghanistan and the formation of a security partnership, Aukus, with Australia and the UK, are the two first pillars of that strategy.\n\u201cThe Afghan decision and the Aukus decision are part of what really is an effort led by Jake, and the president obviously, to bring the country into a post-9/11 foreign policy posture,\u201d Tom Donilon, national security adviser in the Obama administration, said.\n\u201cThis is a big strategic thing that\u2019s going on here and Jake is the intellectual engine behind it.\u201d\nAfter practising and teaching law in Minneapolis, Sullivan\u2019s first foray into politics was as chief counsel to Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar introduced him to Hillary Clinton, who lured him away to work on her 2008 presidential run.\nShe drew on his debating expertise (he came second in the 2000 World University Debating Championship in Sydney) to prepare her for her Senate confirmation hearings as secretary of state and for her presidential debates with Donald Trump in 2016.\nSullivan and Philippe Reines, Clinton\u2019s communications adviser who played the part of Trump in those rehearsal debates, became her closest aides.\nWhen she became secretary of state, the two travelled around the world together, with Sullivan notching up 111 countries visited and Reines 110. It became a competition. In the summer of 2012, Reines thought he had gained a point when Sullivan did not appear on a trip to Mongolia, but late in the evening, in the middle of traditional dinner in a large yurt several hours\u2019 drive from Ulan Bator, Sullivan suddenly materialised.\n\u201cHe somehow managed to find us deep into Asia, where there were no commercial flights of any kind,\u201d Reines recalled.\nIt was only much later that Reines was informed where Sullivan had been \u2013 in Oman with the CIA director, William Burns, in the first secret talks with Iranian officials that ultimately led to the breakthrough 2015 nuclear deal. At the time, Sullivan was 35 years old.\n\u201cIt just speaks volumes about him that the secretary of state of the United States and the president of the United States thought that he could co-lead the negotiations with one of our strongest adversaries on one of the most difficult issues,\u201d Reines said. \u201cThere\u2019s no situation you can put him into that is over his head.\u201d\nSullivan\u2019s critics disagree, pointing out that Sullivan was at the heart of two disasters with long-term fallout: the 2016 election loss to Trump, a campaign in which he played a central role, and the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nOne of Sullivan\u2019s former colleagues suggested that the factor both debacles had in common was a failure on Sullivan\u2019s part to imagine the worst case scenario.\n\u201cHe should have learned in 2016 the general lesson that the worst can happen,\u201d the former colleague said.\nDonilon said it was unfair and inaccurate to paint Sullivan as a blithe optimist.\nHe worked on the 2016 campaign with Sullivan and recalled: \u201cHe was the person who I had conversations with who was most concerned about the state of that campaign, particularly in the Midwest.\u201d\nBedingfield said the criticism is also inaccurate when it comes to decision-making on Afghanistan.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s incredibly misplaced,\u201d she said. \u201cI think numerous participants in the process, from [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs] General Milley to Secretary Blinken to [Director of National Intelligence] Haines, have all said that there was no indication that the Afghan government would collapse in 11 days.\u201d\nDouglas London, who was the CIA\u2019s counter-terrorism chief for south and south-west Asia until 2019 and then an adviser on the Biden campaign, insisted that the agency did sound warnings about the possibility that Afghan warlords and militias could switch sides abruptly.\n\u201cTrump and Biden received the same assessment: the country could collapse in days or weeks with little notice,\u201d said London, whose book The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence is published next week.\n\u201cThe Trump White House simply didn\u2019t care. But the Biden White House did not accept the conditions on which that assessment was based as being credible, so dismissed that scenario as unrealistic.\u201d\nAccording to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Sullivan did voice anxiety and question the speed of the withdrawal, and particularly the abrupt abandonment in early July of Bagram airbase, the nerve centre of the US war in Afghanistan for two decades. But Biden ultimately approved the plan.\nA White House official said there would be no comment on Sullivan\u2019s advice to the president to \u201cprotect the integrity of the process\u201d.\nBruen, who worked in the Obama White House at the same time as Sullivan, argued that the Bagram debate showed he had not shrugged off the instincts of a staffer.\n\u201cThere is this tendency to be deferential, and that\u2019s the staffer role,\u201d Bruen said. \u201cAs a staffer, you are someone whose raison d\u2019etre is to find justifications to support the principal\u2019s position. Your role is very different as a national security adviser. You have to, many times, challenge the president\u2019s views on an issue, help them to see there may be some assumptions they\u2019re making that are wrong.\u201d\nHowever, when a president has made up his mind on a subject, one of Sullivan\u2019s former colleagues said, no national security adviser could stand in the way of the elected commander-in-chief.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt, based on my observations, that Jake Sullivan was clear on his advice,\u201d one of Sullivan\u2019s former White House colleagues said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for anybody to penetrate the conversations between the president and the national security adviser, but at the end of the day the president\u2019s views prevail.\u201d",

But when the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, formally welcomed Goldman Sachs to Birmingham this month, he likened its arrival to one of the summer\u2019s big transfer moves.\n\u201cI hope this isn\u2019t inappropriate,\u201d he said, addressing a crowd of Goldman staff gathered at the city\u2019s newly refurbished Grand Hotel. \u201cI think you probably are the Cristiano Ronaldo moment. You\u2019re the big one to secure.\u201d\nStreet\u2019s team courted the Wall Street bank for months after hearing in September 2019 it was looking for its first office outside London. Two years later, Goldman has hired nearly 100 staff in Birmingham \u2013 mostly engineers, legal, accounting and HR staff \u2013 which will serve as the international headquarters for a new, and still secret, \u201cglobal digital business\u201d to be revealed by early 2023.\nA growing number of professional service firms, including banks, have been looking outside London as they grow, partly to cut labour, property and service costs that continue to rise in the capital. Birmingham has already managed to win over HSBC\u2019s ringfenced consumer bank, which employs 4,000 people locally, as well as Deutsche Bank, the accounting giants KPMG and PwC, and BT, which said this month it was expanding its presence in the UK\u2019s second city with plans to hire another 1,000 staff.\nHowever, despite having 22 universities within an hour\u2019s commute of the city, Birmingham \u2013 which is based in a region best known for manufacturing \u2013 has struggled with the chicken-and-egg issue of wanting to retain professional talent, but not having enough lucrative jobs to attract skilled staff.\nThe UK\u2019s hyper-centralised economy, focused on London and the south-east, has left it lagging behind countries such as France, Germany and the US, which have well-established second-tier cities that have helped to offset economic imbalances within their borders. It has made it harder for places like Birmingham to grow as quickly, or attract as many businesses, that might otherwise look to London first, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda.\nWhile Birmingham boasts more than 1.1 million residents, the proportion of people working in skilled and professional services \u2013 categorised as \u201cknowledge-intensive business services\u201d \u2013 is about 11%, compared with 24% in London, according to the Centre for Cities thinktank. On that measure, \u201cBirmingham is not really performing very well at this point\u201d, Kathrin Enenkel, one of the thinktank\u2019s senior analysts, said.\nThat has made attracting skilled, professional services companies a priority for the Midlands mayor. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have these high-paid jobs,\u201d Street told the Guardian. And like recruiting a star footballer, there are hopes Goldman\u2019s arrival could attract other major players to Birmingham.\n\u201cWe know that companies, particularly those like Goldman Sachs, are clustering next to each other\u201d, Enenkel said. \u201cSo it could be that the presence of Goldman Sachs will attract similar businesses, and then maybe Birmingham will become more attractive for graduates who want to settle there.\u201d\nThat narrative conveniently fits the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda, with the prime minister having promised to raise the level of income in the regions, given the gaping chasm on health, productivity and skills between greater London and other areas of the UK. Although the government has revealed two pots of funding, including a \u00a34.8bn purse to support high street regeneration, and plans to create a Treasury campus in Darlington, Johnson\u2019s team have yet to reveal any flagship policies to address the gap.\nRichard Gnodde, the chief executive of Goldman\u2019s international business, says the bank received no incentives from Johnson\u2019s government when deciding where to base its new venture. \u201cThis is our decision, it makes sense for us and it\u2019s very convenient that it ties in with what the government\u2019s trying to achieve\u201d, Gnodde said.\nThat did not stop Street\u2019s team from making their pitch. Street admits that the costs between regional cities is not a strong selling point, given the variation outside London is minimal. However, he seems to have sold Gnodde on the untapped potential of local engineers and other digitally skilled employees coming from rival firms and local universities. The city\u2019s airport, as well as its proximity to London and the north, helps, even with the completion of HS2 several years away.\nBut, like many cities across the UK, the Covid crisis is still threatening Birmingham\u2019s economic prospects. The city\u2019s unemployment rate was last recorded at 8%, according to the Office for National Statistics. That is the second-highest unemployment rate for a local authority in the UK, behind Barking and Dagenham. Meanwhile, Birmingham has the highest number of people on furlough in the country, at 30,400. That record is partly due to its size, but still amounts to 7% of the local workforce, which is above the UK average of 5%, according to HMRC data.\nWith furlough set to end this week, Paul Forrest, a director at the West Midlands Economic Forum, is calling for a re-skilling commitment to support local workers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that aren\u2019t going to be re-employed in, say, hospitality sectors, but aren\u2019t fully equipped to enter the production sector of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to look at some serious training schemes to offset that.\u201d\nStreet agreed. \u201cThere could be more cash devolved to help us deal with the whole question of skills and qualifications, which actually \u2013 I think \u2013 is the long-term determinant of whether we will level up.\u201d\nThat could prove critical, with the mayor claiming that there is already a \u201cbig pipeline\u201d of financial services firms eyeing Birmingham and the broader region for their next location.\nHowever, Street is keeping his cards close to his chest. \u201cIf a company of Goldman\u2019s calibre has examined all the options and has endorsed us, that sends a message to the market about who might as well.\u201d",

The accident scene is about 150 miles north-east of Helena and about 30 miles from the border with Canada.\nLiberty county sheriff\u2019s dispatcher Starr Tyler said three people died. She did not have more details. Amtrak said in a statement that there were multiple injuries.\nThe train had about 141 passengers and 16 crew members onboard, Abrams said. The train had two locomotives and 10 cars, eight of which derailed, he said.\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,\u201d Abrams said.\nMegan Vandervest, a passenger who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told the New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.\n\u201cMy first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,\u201d said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis. \u201cMy second thought was that\u2019s crazy. We wouldn\u2019t be derailing. Like, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nShe told the Times the car behind hers was tilted, the one behind that was tipped over, and the three cars behind that \u201chad completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train\u201d.\nSpeaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where some passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like \u201cextreme turbulence on a plane\u201d.\nResidents of communities near the crash site quickly mobilized to help. Chester councilwoman Rachel Ghekiere said she and others helped about 50 to 60 passengers who were brought to a local school.\n\u201cI went to the school and assisted with water, food, wiping dirt off faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThey appeared to be tired, shaken but happy that they were where they were. Some looked more disheveled than others, depending where they were on the train.\u201d\nA grocery store in Chester, about five miles from the derailment, and a nearby religious community provided food and the passengers were taken by buses to hotels in nearby Shelby, said Ghekiere, whose husband works for the local emergency services agency and was alerted to the crash.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board will send a 14-member team, including investigators and specialists in railroad signals and other disciplines, to investigate the crash, spokesman Eric Weiss said.\nWeiss said no other trains or equipment were involved. The train was traveling on a BNSF Railway main track at the time, he said.\nPhotos posted to social media showed rail cars on their sides and passengers standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage. The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.\nAmtrak said that because of the derailment, the Sunday westbound Empire Builder will terminate in Minneapolis, and the Sunday eastbound Empire Builder train will originate in Minneapolis.\nAllan Zarembski, director of the Railway Engineering and Safety Program at the University of Delaware, suspected the derailment stemmed from an issue with the train track or equipment, or a combination of both.\nUS railways have \u201cvirtually eliminated\u201d major derailments by human error after the implementation of positive train control, Zarembski said.\n\u201cI would be surprised if this was a human-factor derailment,\u201d Zarembski said.\nDepending on how complex the cause of the derailment was, NTSB findings may take months, Zarembski said, as investigators must interview witnesses and sift through the pile-up and damage to collect evidence, then send samples for further testing.",

        "content": "Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez punched the air and then again and again, any niggling doubts and worries banished as he wheeled away in sheer ecstasy after scoring his first league goal since last October, his first since a life\u2011threatening fracture of his skull. His heartwarming celebration, an outpouring of emotion which culminated in him presenting his protective head guard to the away support before looking to the skies, put to bed months of pent\u2011up frustration.\nIt was a doubtless cathartic moment before the Wolves fans who had been singing his name long before the first whistle and what a wonderful goal it was, the striker making two Southampton defenders look silly before applying the most composed of finishes. At full-time a visibly moved Jim\u00e9nez, who required emergency surgery for a traumatic brain injury last year, embarked on a victory lap of sorts, embracing a home fan wearing a Mexico shirt before heading across the pitch to a gold-coloured pocket of this stadium.\nWolves supporters had broken into Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s \u201cSi Se\u00f1or\u201d chorus seconds before kick-off and were still serenading the striker as he conducted media duties 20 minutes after the final whistle. \u201cThis three points and this goal go straight to Ra\u00fal and the fans,\u201d said the Wolves head coach, Bruno Lage. \u201cThe fans did a fantastic job because they started in the first minutes singing his song. Everyone has given great confidence to him. With goals you give happiness to everyone. The face when you win is not the same face when you lose. It was a special goal for Ra\u00fal. What I saw since the first day was a guy with a big ambition to come back, play and score goals for us.\u201d\nIt was not a riveting contest and the best first-half chance arrived after 44 seconds when the Southampton goalkeeper, Alex McCarthy, repelled a shot by the marauding N\u00e9lson Semedo after neat footwork by Jim\u00e9nez and Daniel Podence. Romain Sa\u00efss sent a looping header at goal from the subsequent corner but that was about as enticing as things got in a dull first half punctuated by errors in midfield and ponderous decision-making in the final third.\nAdama Traor\u00e9, dropped to the bench, had been about to enter but his introduction was delayed by 10 minutes after Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s match-winning strike. Traor\u00e9, standing in the away technical area, joined those in the Wolves dugout and far beyond to applaud the magnificence that unfolded. Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 sent the ball downfield with a mammoth kick and Jim\u00e9nez outmuscled Jan Bednarek before cutting inside Mohammed Salisu. Jim\u00e9nez then again fooled Bednarek, who flung himself to the ground in a desperate attempt to make amends, before side-footing home and setting off on a procession towards the supporters singing his name.\nUntil then, Jim\u00e9nez had been on the periphery, a touch unsure and getting nowhere fast. \u201cI knew the goal was coming, I was fighting for it, working for it and all the team deserve it,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018When will the goal come?\u2019 It felt really good. Four of our five games have been incredible; we need to keep going. The fans are always with us, supporting. It is really important for our team.\u201d\nFor Southampton, the wait for a league victory goes on and things do not get easier with a trip to Stamford Bridge next. There was another sparkling performance by the teenager Tino Livramento, who provided the majority of Southampton\u2019s thrust from right-back with gallivanting runs and full-blooded tackles. Nathan Redmond had the ball in the net in the first half after a clever swivel in the box but was offside and after the break the brilliance of S\u00e1, kept out Saints. He made a superb double save to deny Mohamed Elyounoussi and then Che Adams from the rebound, before later confronting Armando Broja as the substitute surged through one-on-one after a fortuitous break on halfway.\nRalph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s programme notes alluded to Southampton\u2019s struggles in the final third \u2013 \u201cthe only thing missing was the punch to kill the opponent,\u201d he said of stalemates against West Ham and Manchester City \u2013 and it is now three league games without a goal. S\u00e1 saved well from Livramento after unselfish play by Adam Armstrong, who spotted the full-back arriving at the back post, and the sight of Hasenh\u00fcttl arching his back and leaning on his heels as Southampton huffed and puffed on the edge of the area summed up his frustration. \u201cWe are all disappointed because in the moment we are struggling to find the back of the net,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said.",

She said the dire state of the party\u2019s finances was down to legal battles and said it was vital to repair them so that the public would trust the party with the economy.\n\u201cWhen you hear people talking about the state of the party\u2019s finances, remind them that before Jeremy Corbyn our legal fees were around \u00a3200,000 a year. They are now more than \u00a32m a year,\u201d she told a conference rally for the pro-Starmer Labour First group.\n\u201cWhen people talk about cuts to staffing, that\u2019s the reason for it and it\u2019s that mismanagement that has put us in the position we are in today, that this NEC is trying to sort out. And that matters because unless we can sort all of that out, people will not listen to us on the matters that affect them.\u201d\nLast year, Starmer ordered the party\u2019s lawyers to reach a settlement with former party staff who spoke to the BBC Panorama programme about antisemitism, who claimed they were defamed in the party\u2019s response to the broadcast.\nThe party is also facing a bitter legal battle with former staffers who claim private WhatsApp messages were released in the so-called \u201cLabour leaks\u201d report, which was prepared under the former general secretary Jennie Formby.\nThe report \u2013 which was intended for but never submitted to the equalities watchdog\u2019s investigation \u2013 alleged staff had worked to undermine Corbyn\u2019s leadership and sent a number of abusive messages about senior figures.\nCorbyn himself has said he intends to take legal action against the party over the suspension of the party whip, although his team failed in a preliminary challenge to get documents disclosed that they claimed could prove there was a secret deal to readmit him to the party.\nLabour staff have balloted for strike action after David Evans, the general secretary, told staff in July that the party\u2019s management was seeking at least 90 redundancies as it tries to repair finances.\nLabour has said it will seek to make the cuts through voluntary redundancies, but the target represents well over a quarter of all the party\u2019s staff.",

        "content": "I learned that loving birds is best done by walking in the sun, being curious and appreciating the chatter. Not by sitting on my own looking at books and screens\nI once saw a picture of a kid standing proudly next to his science project. It was a handmade poster and emblazoned across the top was the strikingly catchy title: \u201cBirds: they\u2019re fucking everywhere!\u201dObviously photoshopped, these words nevertheless struck me as being both funny and more or less true.\nMany years ago, camping in the Cathedrals in Victoria, I woke early to a strange, whirring birdcall. Groggily, I unzipped the tent enough to stick my head out and squinted unattractively in the dawn light. The bird I saw had astonishing violet-blue eyes and was sort of, I dunno, stripy? I am, you may have guessed, a novice birder. So, I did the exact thing that any experienced birder will tell you not to do. I pulled my head back inside my tent and went straight for my field guide. If you too are new to birding, here\u2019s a tip: your field guide isn\u2019t likely to fly away in the next few seconds and (if you\u2019re not me) you have this ace thing called working memory. So get your priorities straight, put down your field guide (or, more likely these days, your phone) and give your new friend your undivided attention. Because life is short and this moment is fleeting.\nIn this case, violet eyes and \u201csort of stripy\u201d was enough for me to determine that I had just seen a female satin bowerbird. This was very exciting! Of course, by the time I figured out who my new friend was, she had absconded. Satin bowerbirds are perhaps not so elaborate in their art as other bowerbirds. Mainly, they just really, really love blue stuff. Think Bic pen lids and pallet strapping. Armed with this knowledge (gleaned from watching way too many David Attenborough films), I rummaged around our esky, pulled the blue plastic ring off a milk bottle and placed it carefully in the shrubs where I\u2019d have a good view of it.\nI sat on my esky waiting, shivering and clutching my binoculars. My boyfriend suggested this was not how he envisaged our weekend proceeding. By midday, our shady campsite was still damp and cold and I finally relented. As per our original plan, my boyfriend and I headed off for a hike.\nJust a few dozen steps away, at the centre of the campground, the sun was shining and people were eating fish and chips at a picnic table. A large group of birds flocked in a nearby tree, individuals periodically swooping down and milling about on the ground waiting for scraps. These birds were like the seagulls of the Cathedrals campground. They were satin bowerbirds. And among them, I saw an adult male; a hint of deep blue shining from his ostensibly black plumage in the sun. Through my appalled indignation that my coveted, rarely glimpsed bird was, it turns out, quite common, there was a very simple, uncomplicated joy.\nHere\u2019s another tip. If you\u2019re lucky enough to find a quirky little hobby you love, don\u2019t overcomplicate it. Think carefully, for instance, before you rush out to turn it into a PhD. As the late, great, Kurt Vonnegut once said: \u201cSomething, something, something. Just chill out.\u201d Don\u2019t quote me on that.\nFor a while, as you may have cleverly deduced, I tried to turn my love of birds into a PhD. My supervisor told me that I had to learn their calls if I was going to have any chance of gathering the data I needed. Briefly, a new world opened up to me. I tuned in to the sounds of my neighbourhood. In the background, unnoticed and taken for granted, my feathered neighbours engaged in near constant chatter. My newfound curiosity about birdsong \u2013 these little waves of compressed and rarefied air floating through time and space \u2013 rendered the everyday and the mundane new, bright and fresh. Alas. Before long, my own psychology got in the way of forward progress. I found myself binge-watching Downton Abbey and labelling shelves in my linen cupboard during the precious short stretches in which my children were at kinder or with grandparents. I fell further and further behind. Each day I stepped outside my door the birdsong was still there to greet me. Only now, it reminded me, cruelly, of my steadily growing list of missed milestones, my problems with avoidance, the fact that I was letting everyone down. Birdsong, I\u2019m sorry to say, became the ubiquitous, tormenting soundtrack to my own failure. So, I made like the proverbial ostrich sticking its head in the sand (they don\u2019t really do this), and I closed my ears to the birds.\nIt may not surprise you to know that a couple of weeks ago, I broke up with my PhD. And I am happy to report, that as soon as I made that decision, the magic of birdsong returned to me.\nIt turns out that for me, loving birds is best done by simply walking in the sun, being curious, appreciating my landscape. Not sitting on my own in the cold and the dark looking at books and screens. Although, to be fair, books and screens can be very helpful. So go forth. Feel the sun on your skin. Open your ears to the soundtrack of your neighbourhood. Open your heart to the beauty of nature. Notice the birds. They really are fucking everywhere.\n Erin Lennox is an arts graduate and ex-nurse. She quit a PhD on urban birds to homeschool her kids during a global pandemic and then quit the homeschooling gig too. She is now writing a never-to-be-published memoir.",

The central challenge with agriculture is that most of the emissions come from grazing cattle and sheep and materially cutting those emissions is simply not currently possible.\u201d\nThe report\u2019s first recommendation is that agriculture not be exempted from any national net zero target because \u201cthat simply doesn\u2019t work without including the emissions from all sectors\u201d.\nThe report says it is likely the agriculture sector will still be a major source of emissions in 2050, even if its recommendations are followed.\nAgriculture\u2019s link with the land sector allows the industry to aim for net zero by removing carbon from the atmosphere through activities such as soil carbon and planting trees to offset emissions.\nThe report recommended investing in better outreach programs to provide farmers with more information and practical advice, as well as more secure income streams to support their investment in lower-emissions practices.\nTo sharpen incentives, the report included strong recommendations to help farmers begin trading carbon through improvements to the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF).\n\u201cComplexity and the administrative cost of participating in the scheme deters potential proponents of many small projects,\u201d the report said.\nIt recommended allowing multiple projects to be submitted under a single application to help small landholders participate in the scheme.\nOther recommendations regarding the ERF were to broaden the range of emissions-reducing activities and establish a fixed-price purchasing desk to allow access to the fund for landholders too small to participate in an auction.\nAdditionally, the report supports the development of a carbon credit exchange, which differentiates between types of credits including benefits such as biodiversity. Wood said this would align with government initiatives already in place including the biodiversity platform introduced by the minister for agriculture, David Littleproud.\nWood highlighted that at the moment the ERF is a major source of revenue in agriculture, but the current government-funded system is not sustainable, and that in future the offsetting will have to be paid for by taxpayers, consumers or famers.\nThe report also included recommendations focused on improving the long-term outlook for emissions reduction by supporting the research, development, and deployment of new technologies.\nThe report recommended \u201cthe government should expand the remit and increase funding of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) to allow it to support early-stage development of low-emissions agricultural technologies that are not energy-related.\u201d\nSuzanne Harter, a climate and energy campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said that while \u201creducing emissions from agriculture is a critical part of what\u2019s needed for Australia to achieve net zero emissions and farmers should be helped in this effort \u2026 Arena cannot be the solution to every sector\u2019s investment needs.\u201d\nHarter said the recommendation to expand the agency\u2019s remitrisks further diluting its mission to support renewable energy technology.\nFor the land sector, the report recommended state and territory governments should not weaken existing land clearing laws, and should aim to keep existing stocks of nature-based carbon at or above current levels.\nThe report clarifies that recommendation does not prevent all vegetation clearing, but ensures that clearing or land degradation in one location is offset by regrowth or land restoration elsewhere.\n\u201cThe goal should be to ensure that the land sector stays at or below net zero \u2013 it should continue to remove more carbon from the atmosphere each year than it emits,\u201d it states.\nAs well as reducing the risk it presents to 70% of the sector\u2019s products, exports which may be subjected to future carbon tariffs from other nations, the agriculture industry itself is particularly vulnerable to climate change.\nThe report said changes in rainfall patterns over the past 20 years have cut profits across the sector by 23%.\n\u201cThe more that farmers can reduce emissions, the fewer credits they will need to offset their own emissions, and the more they can sell to others \u2013 diversifying their revenue streams,\u201d Wood said.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nThe agriculture report is the third of a series of five policy reports, including transport and industry, ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Federation have already supported an economy-wide aspiration of net zero by 2050 with some conditions, and peak bodies across the red meat industry have supported the goal of Australia\u2019s red meat industry becoming carbon neutral by 2030, while the pork industry has even cited 2025.\nThe report highlights, as the Treasurer said on Friday, that \u201cconverging international and domestic political pressures have created a window of opportunity for progress on climate change policy.\u201d\nEnergy minister Angus Taylor\u2019s office was contacted for comment.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

        "content": "Exit poll shows vote share of the conservative Christian Democratic Union on 25%\nAs the first exit poll flashed up on the screens inside the Konrad Adenauer Haus, the Berlin headquarters of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party faithful who had gathered in the central courtyard fell silent.\nThe black bar representing their conservative party showed up first: 25%, the worst result the dominant political force of modern German politics \u2013 the party of Angela Merkel, Helmut Kohl and Adenauer \u2013 has recorded in its history. Until today, the CDU\u2019s low point was the 31% it gained at the first democratic vote in the postwar era, in 1949.\n\u201cVote for what makes Germany strong\u201d, urged a large banner outside the building, showing the head of CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet at the end of a line of era-defining chancellors. But tonight the CDU looked weak, and Laschet will face an uphill struggle to inherit the chancellory on the back of such a painful result.\nThe CDU not only has history on its side, however; it also has an uncanny inability to give up a fight. When the television screen showed the bar for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) revealing the two traditional broad-church parties to be neck-and-neck, there were yelps of relief.\nBy the time it was clear that a leftwing coalition between the SPD, the Greens and Die Linke would on first exit polls not have enough support for a governing majority, young Christian Democrats were cheering and clapping with their hands in the air.\nWhen Laschet took to the stage at his party HQ at shortly before 7pm CET, his speech was almost upbeat: \u201cWe knew this would be an open and tight election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be happy with the result, but this will be a long evening.\u201d\nLike Olaf Scholz, the SPD candidate, he laid a claim to lead the next government. Every vote for his party was a vote against a leftwing government, he said, \u201cwhich is why we will do everything to form a government under the leadership of the [Christian Democratic] Union\u201d.\nDuring the Merkel era, Germany\u2019s conservatives had long looked immune to the erosion in support suffered by other traditional parties of the centre right across Europe. In 2013, the chancellor shored up 41.5% of the national vote behind her party, an emphatic win reminiscent of the middle of the 20th century, when Germany was a de-facto two party state.\nNow that the CDU has caught up with the rest of Europe, it is unclear what the ramifications will be. Rightwingers in the party will blame Merkel for gutting her conservative outfit of its old ideological core, leaving her successor to pick up the mess. Centrist will say the ideological core has had little to offer to a modern German electorate, and that it was only thanks to Merkel\u2019s skill that the party managed to remain popular for so long.\nMany will point a finger at Laschet, who ran a campaign that lacked focus, energy and a coherent message. The lackadaisical air that has followed him throughout the campaign trail was evident even on the day of the vote: as Laschet posed in front of photographers at the polling station, it was obvious that he had folded his ballot the wrong way around, so his own vote was clear for everyone to see.\nMany commentators will argue that the CDU would have won a clear victory if it had picked as its candidate Markus S\u00f6der, the highly energetic and waspish state premier of Bavaria. Sunday\u2019s result in Germany\u2019s south throws a question mark over such received wisdom: the Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU\u2019s Bavarian sister party, looked on course to get 33% of the vote in the conservative stronghold, the second worst result in its history.\nAs the Christian Democratic Union\u2019s members digested the result on Sunday night, eyes turned to the result in the electoral district number 196.\nThe constituency, in an unspectacular part of the eastern state of Thuringia, was seen by some as one battleground that could point to the party\u2019s future: the CDU was represented here by Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, the former head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, who was forced to resign in 2018 after being accused of ignoring evidence of anti-immigrant riots in the east.\nMaa\u00dfen sees his job as being to win back CDU voters who have drifted off to Alternative for Germany (AfD), mainly by coopting their agenda. On social media channels, he has railed against Merkel\u2019s immigration policy, \u201ceconomic globalists\u201d, and a perceived takeover of the national media by leftwing activists.\nThe AfD sees it differently: it has hopes that Maa\u00dfen could open the door to future coalitions between the large conservative bloc and the far-right upstarts. One local AfD branch, in the city of Suhl, endorsed Maa\u00dfen over its own candidate, urging its supporters to vote for \u201ca candidate with backbone and political experience\u201d.\nOn Sunday night it looked like the Maa\u00dfen experiment had failed spectacularly: not only was the SPD on course to win the seat in district number 196, but the CDU rightwinger was trailing behind the AfD in third place.\nThe worst-case scenario for the Christian Democrats was always that its party would descend into infighting as soon as the clock struck 6 on Sunday, and be unfit to conduct coherent coalition talks in the coming weeks.\nIf the eventual result as close as it seems, and with no emboldened rival in sight, Laschet is likely to survive. His party will do its utmost to block out the historic nature of its defeat, and fight to keep alive its dream of providing the country with its next chancellor.",

        "content": "Eyebrows were raised when the sometimes-combustible Swiss was picked but in the end everything ran through him\nAs Tottenham\u2019s defenders glared at each other in reproach for a third time, a beaming Thierry Henry extended his arms in celebration. Enjoying the spectacle with Henry in one of the Emirates\u2019 executive boxes was Daniel Ek, the Spotify co-owner and high-profile suitor for the keys to one of English football\u2019s grandest old estates.\nThey were revelling in an evisceration: for 45 minutes Arsenal produced football of speed, imagination and incision that recalled some of Henry\u2019s happiest derby experiences. Those stormy days in May, when Ek sought to exploit the fury surrounding Arsenal\u2019s decline and the botched Super League breakaway by making a bid for the club, could not have seemed further away. Wherever he was watching, Stan Kroenke must have felt there was plenty of life in his habitually tormented investment yet.\nWho would pull the plug on the sight of Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka and Martin \u00d8degaard flooding into the yawning spaces in front of Tottenham\u2019s defence? Arsenal\u2019s three young schemers were scintillating: against disastrously loose opponents they were simply sharper, quicker and brighter. But while Mikel Arteta has set his stock in the new, realigning his squad at considerable expense to shift its balance from comfortable underachievement, one of his remaining old hands was at the heart of everything Arsenal\u2019s tyros produced here.\nWhen Granit Xhaka\u2019s name appeared on the teamsheet for the first time since a straight red card at Manchester City, the trains of thought were understandable if not entirely original. Arsenal had been resolute, calm and collected in beating Burnley a week previously: now, in the first derby in front of fans here for two years, they were introducing their firebrand to the tinderbox. \u201cWe have to play with cool minds and understand what are the limits in the game,\u201d Arteta had said in the buildup when asked directly about his midfielder\u2019s disciplinary record.\nSo Xhaka stepped out and pushed boundaries of a different kind. This was a masterful performance from the Swiss, who wanted to leave Arsenal during the summer but was persuaded to sign a contract extension after a proposed move to Roma did not materialise. Xhaka\u2019s powers of perception on the ball have not always shone through in an era of slow, stuffy Arsenal engine rooms. His proponents would argue he has not generally been blessed with such a whirr of fizz, wit and invention in front of him; here that argument was strengthened and Arsenal operated in devastating sync.\nWithin seven minutes a smart first-time ball from Xhaka to Smith Rowe had taken out Spurs\u2019 midfield, or whatever passed for it, resulting in a saved effort from a narrowly offside Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The breakthrough was not long in coming: after Ben White beat Harry Kane to a header, Xhaka nipped in to bypass Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg with the deftest of snicks to \u00d8degaard. Arsenal were four against four and, two passes later, Smith Rowe had clipped home Saka\u2019s cutback.\nAlthough 50 yards further back, Xhaka\u2019s influence in the second goal was not dissimilar. Aaron Ramsdale was signed with the intention of improving Arsenal\u2019s distribution from their own penalty area but appeared to have faltered when H\u00f8jbjerg pursued Xhaka to a short pass out. But Xhaka dropped a shoulder, left a tumbling H\u00f8jbjerg for dead and found Smith Rowe. The move that followed, a thrilling sweep from one end to the other that Aubameyang finished off, must have rolled back the years for Henry.\nUntil half-time the rule of thumb was simple: anything that beat H\u00f8jbjerg, a hapless figure attempting to anchor Spurs\u2019 midfield, was almost certain to bring a direct threat to Hugo Lloris\u2019s goal. \u201cThe gameplan was not right according to the players who were on the pitch,\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo said afterwards. Tottenham certainly improved when Oliver Skipp, replacing the woeful Dele Alli, arrived to divide some of H\u00f8jbjerg\u2019s midfield labour. But the damage had been done, largely because of Xhaka\u2019s precision in exposing the ragged structure with which Spurs had begun.\nThe paradox was that Arteta had laid himself open to charges of over-caution when picking Xhaka in place of Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, ditching the adventurous 4-1-4-1 that started at Turf Moor and opting to field his stalwart alongside Thomas Partey. In selecting Alli and Tanguy Ndombele in front of H\u00f8jbjerg, Nuno had appeared relatively ambitious. Instead, Xhaka found himself with no end of grateful recipients to feed and Arsenal could run amok.\n\u201cThese people have stood by this club and these players; this win is for them,\u201d Arteta said of the supporters who, even as Tottenham made a fist of the second half, rarely dialled down the noise. For Smith Rowe, who was outstanding, it was \u201cprobably the best day of my life\u201d. Such a rousing afternoon felt like the final removal of a weight, a resounding clearing of the throat: Arsenal will not be lifting league titles here any time soon, but they can point to a clarity and sense of direction that cast Nuno\u2019s team into the shade.\nIt felt cruel, although perhaps a matter for another day, that the only sour note involved Xhaka. As feared, he left the pitch early: rather than any infraction, though, the cause was a collision with Lucas Moura that appeared to jar his knee. Arteta admitted \u201cit doesn\u2019t look very positive at the moment\u201d. Everything else does, for now. Sitting side by side, Henry and Ek could marvel, perhaps in some bewilderment, at the difference four months can make.",

        "content": "After eight games of the season Manchester United are already in desperate-for-a-win territory as they prepare for the visit of Villarreal to Old Trafford on Wednesday.\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r remains positive despite the club\u2019s troubling start. \u201cWe have a Champions League game and we are looking forward to that,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start well [in the competition] but we will be fired up, the fans and the players, for that one. We will be on the front foot looking to win.\u201d\nWhy the mini-crisis before the clocks go back? Because United are an early-season puzzle. Good or bad? Profligate or unlucky? Missing a vital \u2013 call it Declan Rice-shaped \u2013 element in midfield? Or is Solskj\u00e6r three or four performances away from discovering how to assemble a line-up of talent featuring Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Paul Pogba, Jadon Sancho, Luke Shaw, Edinson Cavani and Marcus Rashford (when fit) into a sleek, powerful proposition?\nSo far, so erratic. In the last fortnight United have played badly in defeats at Young Boys (2-1, Champions League) and at home to West Ham (1-0, Carabao Cup) and Aston Villa (1-0, Premier League).\nCold analysis shows Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men are out of one competition \u2013 the Carabao Cup. They have lost one league game so far, which is the same as the champions, Manchester City, and United are one point behind the leaders, Liverpool. Victory over Villarreal will change the narrative of Group F, in which Atalanta are the fourth side.\nBut it is the manner of the displays that points a light at Solskj\u00e6r. If the Carabao Cup exit can be chalked off as United\u2019s second XI, Saturday\u2019s defeat was reminiscent of Young Boys and previous ones where the plot was also seriously lost. Two occurred last season: the 6-1 league humiliation at Old Trafford on 4 October against Tottenham and the slipshod 2-1 Champions League loss at Istanbul Basaksehir a month later.\nIn all of these Solskj\u00e6r sent a team out that lacked a solid core, one unable to shut off a contest when required. This is where it could be argued that Sancho and/or Ronaldo were the wrong summer buy and instead Rice (or AN Other) should have been recruited to run midfield and thus the game.\nBut, if the attack consistently fires this can be a non-debate. Against Villa, in the first half, Mason Greenwood was a terror but neither he nor a colleague could score. This happens. Teams lack concentration, the killer edge goes awol, there are off-days.\n\u201cWe had started the season well until today,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cThis is our first loss in the league, it is very finely balanced. I know these players, I know they will fight to put this right.\u201d\nThe question remains: are the losses to Young Boys, Basaksehir, Tottenham and Villa the requisite growing pains of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s nascent squad? Or a pattern that shows a fault-line with his management, the Norwegian\u2019s ability to make United what they have to be this season \u2013 true contenders?",

        "content": "Steve Stricker\u2019s six debutants contributed the majority of the points in a resounding, record-breaking victory\nWhat began on Friday morning as an opportunity for American redemption after recent Ryder Cup disappointments ended on Sunday afternoon with a record-breaking victory that doubles as an ominous statement of intent for the years ahead.\nEven before Xander Schauffele smacked a ball into the overcast Wisconsin blue toward the shimmering waters of Lake Michigan to kick off Sunday\u2019s dozen singles matches, the victory celebrations were already in full swing all over the horseshoe-shaped grandstand encircling the first tee, where rowdy spectators clad in red, white and blue sucked down tall cans of beer and sang the Star-Spangled Banner and God Bless America between resounding chants of \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d\nIt was a morning bursting with promise for an American team that since the turn of the century and even before has chronically underperformed at the Ryder Cup despite regularly coming in with the superior individual players. Not only did the US team wake up with one hand on the trophy, only 3\u00bd points from the finish line, but the record margin of victory (18\u00bd-9\u00bd, achieved three times) was in very real danger of falling. After Daniel Berger won by one hole over Matt Fitzpatrick, it did.\nThe rollicking scenes all over the Straits Course were familiar enough: the American fans have always gone all out for golf\u2019s biennial matchplay showcase. It is the players\u2019 commitment to competing for team, country and captain that has too often been called into question during an alarming run of form that included defeats in seven of the previous nine competitions and 12 of 17 going back to 1985.\nPaul Azinger, who made four appearances as a player before captaining the team to a memorable win over the Europeans at Valhalla in 2008, put a fine point on America\u2019s self-defeating ambivalence as recently as Friday morning. \u201cIt means more to every European that\u2019s ever played than to any American that\u2019s ever played, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad for us. It means the world to me, but I just don\u2019t know how you match the energy, the passion and the meaning that Europe brings to these matches: it\u2019s everything to them. It\u2019s their whole life\u2019s work, they think about being on the Ryder Cup team their whole life. Americans aren\u2019t quite that way but it\u2019s in our head. We want to win.\n\u201cI think this American team has a chip on its shoulder \u2026 you have six rookies here who are unscarred, the veterans are pretty engaged so it\u2019s going to be a lot for Europe to overcome.\u201d\nOptimism prevailed in the run-up but not even Azinger could have foreseen the scale of the carnage that played out: that a US team including six Ryder Cup debutants would break from the gate with dominant showings in both Friday sessions, extend their lead once more in Saturday morning\u2019s foursomes and never look back, giving their European rivals no quarter from wire to wire and reducing the entirety of Sunday\u2019s singles matches to a formality.\nFrom a distance it might not seem that extraordinary an outcome. Steve Stricker\u2019s talent-stacked 12-man team includes six major champions, an Olympic gold medallist and 10 of the world\u2019s top 13 players. They enjoyed the familiar advantage of being able to align the setup of the 7,500-yard course to their strengths and a magnified edge in crowd support due to Covid-19 travel restrictions on European-based spectators. The Americans simply lived up to expectations, lofty as they were.\nIt is entirely possible the US team will come hurtling back to earth in Rome in two years and the familiar questions will resurface, but the Whipping at Whistling Straits feels significant, if not an epochal sea change. The old guard of Woods, Mickelson, Furyk et al are gone, along with the malaise that came to define their era. The historic rout that unfolded over the weekend was handed down by the youngest team in the competition\u2019s 94-year history \u2013 with an average age of 29 and only 12 previous appearances among them \u2013 many of whom are all but certain to be fixtures in the team for a decade or more to come.\nThe six first-time Ryder Cup participants who comprised half of the team \u2013 Schauffele (aged 27), Scottie Scheffler (25), Patrick Cantlay (29), Harris English (32), Collin Morikawa (24) and Daniel Berger (28) \u2013 didn\u2019t simply hold their own but led from the front and contributed the majority of the points. And Stricker, the steady hand who used four of his six discretionary picks on rookies, did an excellent job of selecting players who were comfortable together and played within themselves as a result.\n\u201cThe young guys on this team get along really well,\u201d Cantlay said after his 4&2 win over Lowry. \u201cWe sent out rookies maybe four out of the first five matches. That\u2019s unheard of and those guys are performing. Everybody gets along. The atmosphere is light but I know everyone has that killer instinct and we are going to bring that to future cups.\u201d\nStricker\u2019s team might not have the historical heft of the 1981 Ryder Cup team that has long been held up as the competition\u2019s gold standard: a team including Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Raymond Floyd, Hale Irwin, Larry Nelson, Ben Crenshaw and Johnny Miller that rampaged to a 18\u00bd-9\u00bd win over the Europeans at Walton Heath.\nBut that they\u2019re even in the conversation after Sunday\u2019s coronation is remarkable enough a testament to a generational shift that may well signal the birth of a dynasty.",

        "content": "It was a case of when and not if. By how many rather than how. The scale of United States\u2019 dominance in the 43rd Ryder Cup was such that post-mortems as relating to P\u00e1draig Harrington\u2019s European captaincy were well under way long before the event had even finished.\nThis proved a trouncing for the ages and, at long last, a case of substance to back up US hype. This quickly developed into the Lake Michigan mismatch, where the hosts were hot in pursuit of glory by a record margin. This US team became the first in the modern era to reach 19 points, to Europe\u2019s paltry nine.\nHarrington, who placed heavy emphasis on how this battle would impact his professional legacy, will be wounded by what transpired at Whistling Straits. Captaincy is defined by results, however unfair that is. Europe, the weaker side, were simply outplayed.\nAt 11-5 down heading into the singles, nobody really gave Europe serious hope of retaining the trophy. They were ultimately swept away by a wave of US momentum; the bad news for Europe is this team, pieced together by Steve Stricker, has scope to be around for a considerable time. The US had lost four of the last five Ryder Cups; their response could barely have been more emphatic. And this, significantly, arrived in what has quickly developed into a post-Tiger Woods world. \u201cThis is going to be the next era of Ryder Cup team for the US side,\u201d said Patrick Cantlay. \u201cWe have a lot of young guys and I think they are going to be on teams for a long time.\u201d Gulp.\nFrom Rory McIlroy, there were tears. McIlroy broke down during media duties in the immediate aftermath of beating Xander Schauffele. It seemed incredible to recall McIlroy once branded the Ryder Cup an \u201cexhibition.\u201d In Wisconsin, he was clearly hurt at not being able to make a greater on-course contribution to Europe\u2019s cause. Not that McIlroy alone determined the outcome of this Ryder Cup; the US were utterly dominant.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never cried or got emotional over what I\u2019ve done as an individual,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a shit.\n\u201cI love being a part of this team. I love my teammates so much and I should have done more for them this week. I\u2019m glad I put a point on the board for the team today. I just can\u2019t wait to get another shot at this. It is by far the best experience in golf and I hope there are boys and girls watching this today who aspire to play in this event or the Solheim Cup. The more and more I play in this event, I realise that it\u2019s the best event in golf, bar none.\n\u201cNo matter what happens later I am proud of every single player, I\u2019m proud of the captain and vice-captains. It\u2019s been a tough week.\u201d At least he cares.\nEurope\u2019s only singles bright spot, and it seems odd to label it that, arrived in the form of McIlroy. Sent out in match number one with the view of triggering a sporting miracle, the Northern Irishman put struggles of the opening two days firmly behind him. McIlroy saw off Schauffele 3&2, but the four-times major winner\u2019s demeanour suggested he didn\u2019t entirely know what to make of it all. Raw emotion followed.\nThe remainder of the scoreboard was a sea of red. Two veterans, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood, joined McIlroy in delivering just three European singles wins.\nCantlay was behind to Shane Lowry after two but responded to the point where he was three up after six. Cantlay was to close out victory pretty comfortably, by 4&2. The US now needed just three more points.\nJon Rahm, perhaps weary from carrying a golfing continent on his shoulders for two days, lost the first four holes to Scottie Scheffler. Stricker\u2019s use of wildcards, six of them, has been a key Ryder Cup theme. Many questioned Scheffler\u2019s receipt of a captain\u2019s pick; the Texan had the last laugh, beating the world No1 4&3.\nBryson DeChambeau, not without his public relations incidents to seek, had been a darling of the galleries since arriving at Whistling Straits. Strong performances help. DeChambeau walked off the 1st tee with putter in hand, having driven the 373-yard par four. The cheers had barely abated with DeChambeau rolled in his 40ft putt for an eagle two. Sergio Garc\u00eda found DeChambeau too hot to handle, with the US recording a 3&2 win. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said DeChambeau. \u201cThe atmosphere is electric and I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. It\u2019s quite a scene, one to remember for a lifetime. We can all come together as one team. We came together and had unity here this week. Even though we are competitors, we can all be friends and have unity.\u201d It wasn\u2019t ever thus.\nCollin Morikawa, the Open champion, was now in pole position to seal victory for the US. He needed just a halve from his tight match with Viktor Hovland for the other seven pairings elsewhere on the course to be rendered irrelevant. Morikawa was two down to the colourful Norwegian after two but led by the same margin by the 8th tee. Hovland rolled in a 20ft putt on the 15th, as squared the game.\nWith Justin Thomas cantering towards victory against Tyrrell Hatton, it became possible the former US PGA champion would steal Morikawa\u2019s thunder.\nDustin Johnson, who was comfortable against Paul Casey, was part of the same discussion. Morikawa watched a putt for an eagle three, and to win the hole, stay agonisingly above ground at the 16th.\nMorikawa chose the perfect time to produce the shot of the day. At the par three 17th, he drew a wonderful long iron to within 3ft of the cup. That Morikawa took a one up lead to the final tee was confirmation that the Ryder Cup was switching location. Hovland actually won the last, providing an anti-climactic moment, but the US had no cause to care. Johnson soon became the first American since 1979 to win five matches out of five. This was the most resounding of successes.",

        "content": "Outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel could remain in post for weeks or months while parties attempt to cobble together a coalition\nThe two main rivals vying to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor have each said they will try to head the next government. So what happens next?\nGermany\u2019s chancellor is not directly elected but chosen through a vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, after a government has been formed. Merkel could remain in her post for weeks if not months while parties try to cobble together a coalition.\nAfter years of two-party coalitions, three parties will probably be needed this time to achieve a majority \u2013 common in Germany\u2019s regional parliaments but not seen at the national level since the 1950s.\nIn most parliamentary systems, the head of state nominates a party to form a government \u2013 usually the party that has won the biggest share of the vote.\nBut in Germany, all parties can embark on what are known as \u201cexploratory talks\u201d.\nIn this initial phase, which has no time limit, there is nothing to stop the parties from all holding coalition talks in parallel, although tradition dictates that the biggest party will invite smaller ones for discussions.\nBut Armin Laschet, the chancellor candidate from Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU-CSU bloc, said on Sunday that the conservatives would \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to lead the next government, even after preliminary results put them a touch behind the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).\nHis SPD rival Olaf Scholz, the country\u2019s finance minister, said voters wanted a change and for \u201cthe next chancellor to be called Olaf Scholz\u201d.\nThe Greens have already called a party congress for next Saturday, 2 October, during which they could decide with whom they would take up exploratory talks.\nDiscussions will begin as soon as the results are in, with the parties looking to discover each other\u2019s red lines and establish whether they can work together.\nOn Monday, the day after the election, the parties will hold leadership meetings. The newly elected MPs from each party will also hold their first meetings next week, with the SPD and CDU-CSU planning to convene on Tuesday.\nThe pro-business FDP party, which like the Greens could play a kingmaker role, has said it has a preference for a coalition with the conservatives and the Greens, but a three-way alliance with the SPD and Greens remains on the table too.\nThe newly elected parliament must hold its inaugural session no later than 30 days after the election, on 26 October.\nIf two or three parties agree in principle that they would like to form an alliance, they must then begin formal coalition negotiations, with various working groups meeting to thrash out policy issues.\nAt the end of these negotiations, the parties decide who will be in charge of which ministry and sign a coalition contract, a thick document setting out the terms of the agreement.\nThis phase also has no time limit, with the outgoing government holding the fort in the meantime.\nThe parties then nominate who they would like to be chancellor before the official vote in the Bundestag.\nAfter Germany\u2019s last election on 24 September 2017, Merkel was formally confirmed chancellor in a coalition between the CDU-CSU and the centre-left Social Democrats only on 14 March 2018.\nAccording to article 63 of the German constitution, the head of state must propose a potential chancellor to the Bundestag.\nIf no cross-party alliance emerges, president Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the SPD may still nominate a potential chancellor, most likely from whichever party won the biggest share of the vote.\nThe parliament will then vote in a secret ballot, with the candidate needing an absolute majority.\nIf this is not achieved, a second vote will be held two weeks later. If there is still no absolute majority, there is then an immediate third vote in which a relative majority is enough.\nThe president then decides whether to appoint the chancellor as head of a minority government or to dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections.\nThis worst-case scenario was narrowly avoided in 2017: faced with an impasse in negotiations, Steinmeier urged the parties to meet again, pushing for the renewal of the so-called grand coalition.",

Later she became the director of the Curative Health Service to WPHA.\n\u201cShe set the standard, and a challenge that will motivate the young people,\u201d the Western Province Health Authority wrote in its announcement of her death on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge vacuum late Dr N Pomat left. In the PNG medical [fraternity] it\u2019s a great loss. Thank you for serving PNG and Western Province with distinction.\u201d\nIn another tribute, parents of a young child Pomat helped care for wrote: \u201cIn some of the most trying months of our lives, she was there offering guidance and encouragement. She was soft spoken and gentle, yet unmoveable in her determination to honour God and to love people. The world was a better place with her in it.\u201d\nThe acting prime minister, Soroi Eoe, said Pomat was unvaccinated and urged all medical practitioners get vaccinated to protect themselves. It is believed that other health workers from PNG have died from Covid-19, but this is the first death of a doctor that the government has announced it believes has been due to the virus.\nPapua New Guinea is grappling with a third wave of Covid-19 and Western Province has been named as a hotspot, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly in the province. The country has officially recorded 19,000 cases and 225 deaths from Covid-19 during the pandemic, but the real numbers are thought to be far higher, skewed by incredibly low testing rates.\nThe deputy controller of the national pandemic response, Dr Daoni Esorom, announced last week that the hospital in Daru, the capital of Western Province, had reported 89 positive cases over two weeks.\nOther provinces being closely monitored due to the increase in positive cases include Eastern Highlands, West Sepik, Enga and the National Capital District.\nSuper-spreader events like the popular annual Goroka show, held in the Eastern Highland capital to coincide with the country\u2019s independence, were cancelled due to the increase in cases in the province.\nThe Eastern Highlands administrator, John Gimiseve, said the decision was made in the interest of the people.\n\u201cIn the first two weeks of September alone, 24 new cases and four deaths were recorded in the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is very alarming and serious for our people.\n\u201cTo further complicate the situation, our population in general are not adhering to the new normal measures. Even the vaccine uptake among our frontline population in the province at 33% is risky \u2026 The huge number of unvaccinated population accessing the show places a greater risk and will culminate in enormous calamity after the show.\u201d\nLess than 0.5% of all Papua New Guineans have been fully vaccinated to date, a lower rate than in neighbouring Melanesian countries, such as Fiji (43%), Solomon Islands (3.3%) and Vanuatu (4.5%).\nVaccine hesitancy in PNG has been very strong, with misinformation and fear hampering efforts to immunise the population. Despite the international community scrambling to get vaccine doses to PNG in March after a second outbreak in the country, the government had to destroy tens of thousands of doses that were not used before they expired.\nEarlier in September, 30,000 doses of AstraZeneca due to expire in two months were sent to Vietnam through Covax because they looked unlikely to be used in PNG before the expiry date.",

The NSW treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, has said, \u201cit has been a difficult winter but it will be a bright summer\u201d once vaccination target is achieved.\nThis roadmap applies to greater Sydney and parts of the state that are still under stay-at-home orders.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about NSW\u2019s \u201croad to freedom\u201d, as it is being called.\nStay-at-home orders for adults who have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will be lifted from the Monday after NSW achieves the 70% double-dose vaccination target.\nEstimates predict NSW will reach 70% double-dose vaccination (of over-16s) beforeMonday 11 October, based on data from the seven-day average. If so, the freedoms would come into effect on that date.\nThere\u2019s a substantial list of freedoms on the horizon.\nGatherings: Going to visit other people inside their homes will be allowed, of up to five visitors, but all adults in the household have to be fully vaccinated. Children under 12 won\u2019t be counted towards that limit.\nOutdoors, up to 20 people will be allowed to gather. This is an increase from the limit of five fully vaccinated people allowed to gather outside as part of the 6m dose freedom that was announced two weeks ago, which will come into effect on 13 September.\nHospitality: Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to reopen under the \u201cone person per 4 sq metres\u201d rule indoors, and one person per 2 sq metres for outdoors.\nRetail: Stores can reopen with one person per 4 sq metres (unvaccinated people will continue to only be able to access critical retail).\nHairdressers and nail salons, as well as other personal services, can open with one person per 4 sq metres, capped at five clients per premises.\nGyms and indoor recreation facilities can open under with one person per 4 sq metres rule and can offer classes for up to 20 people.\nSporting facilities, including swimming pools, can reopen.\nStadiums, theatres and major outdoor recreation facilities: Major recreation outdoor facilities, including stadiums, racecourses, theme parks and zoos, can reopen with one person per 4 sq metres, capped at 5,000 people. Up to 500 people can attend ticketed and seated outdoor events.\nIndoor entertainment and information facilities, including cinemas, theatres, music halls, museums and galleries, can reopen with one person per 4 sq metres or 75% fixed seated capacity.\nWeddings, funerals and places of worship will also reopen. Up to 50 guests can attend weddings, with dancing permitted and eating and drinking only while seated. Up to 50 guests can attend funerals, with eating and drinking while seated. Churches and places of worship to open subject to one person per 4 sq metres, with no singing.\nThe NSW government has said it will incorporate vaccination proof into the Services NSW smartphone application, which is the same app used to check into venues. You will still need to check into venues when you are fully vaccinated.\nRight away. Say you\u2019ve had only had one dose by the Monday after the 70% target is reached, but your second dose was booked for the following day, on Tuesday. As soon as you receive your second jab, you\u2019ll no longer have to comply with the stay-at-home orders and can enjoy the freedoms mentioned above.\nThe 5km rule will be lifted, but residents of greater Sydney will not be allowed to travel into the regions until the state reaches 80% double dose vaccinations.\nEmployers must continue to allow employees to work from home if the employee is able to do so.\nIf you work in hospitality, retail or any of the public-facing service businesses that are allowed to reopen, you will have to be fully vaccinated to work.\nYou will still be under existing lockdown restrictions, Berejiklian has insisted. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to have unvaccinated people mixing with vaccinated people,\u201d she said.\nThose under 16 who aren\u2019t vaccinated will be able to access all outdoor settings but will only be able to visit indoor venues with members of their household.\nYes, but the outdoor mask mandate will no longer apply to you. Masks will remain mandatory for all indoor public venues, including public transport, front-of-house hospitality, retail and business premises, on planes and at airports.\nOnly hospitality staff will be required to wear a mask when outdoors. Children aged under 12 will not need to wear a mask indoors.\nThat\u2019s unclear. The government has said there will be revised guidance on isolation for close and casual contacts who are fully vaccinated, with details to be provided closer to the reopening date.\nYes. The roadmap is subject to further fine-tuning and health advice if circumstances change drastically or if cases within a designated area remain too high.",

Invariably they are the victims of smuggling networks motivated solely by profit.\nBut Greece\u2019s announcement of a media blitz to discourage \u201cillegal migrant flows\u201d from Afghanistan only weeks after Taliban militants seized power has also left the ambassador appalled.\nIn the face of European hostility to Afghans heading west \u2013 and as the new regime vows to rule according to a ruthless interpretation of Islamic law \u2013 Samadi, like other career diplomats still loyal to the old regime, has found himself imploring EU governments to think again.\n\u201cThis is a time for solidarity, not the time for the west to turn its back on the people of Afghanistan and abandon them or have a campaign that urges [them] to stay,\u201d he told the Guardian in his cavernous ambassadorial office. \u201cIn normal circumstances I would not be in favour of illegal movement but when people are forced to leave due to the security situation and for fear of their lives, what should we do?\u201d\nThe centre-right government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, unveiled the EU-funded initiative, saying its goal was \u201cto make clear that Greece guards its borders in an organised way and does not allow illegal migration flows\u201d.\nAmid fears of the country again becoming the gateway for thousands of Europe-bound refugees desperate to escape the excesses of Islamist hardliners still seeking international legitimacy, the Greek migration ministry admitted the move had been prompted by \u201cthe latest geopolitical developments in Afghanistan\u201d.\nUnder the campaign, mainstream Afghan newspapers and social media will be targeted in what officials have called a blitzkrieg of messaging aimed at dissuading Afghans from paying smugglers to help them flee.\nPlatforms including YouTube will be employed, with videos reportedly being prepared to convey the unvarnished reality of what awaits people if they succeed in reaching Greece through irregular means. Last week asylum seekers on Samos were moved into a \u201cclosed\u201d and highly fortified reception centre \u2013 the first of five EU-funded facilities on Aegean isles \u2013 that is encircled by military-style fencing and equipped with magnetic gates more resonant of a prison than a migrant camp, NGOs say.\nIn his smart blue suit, cufflink shirt, loafers and yellow tie, Samadi, who served in Washington prior to arriving in Athens in 2019, is visually everything the Taliban are not. Like Afghan ambassadors worldwide, he was appointed by the now exiled foreign minister, Mohammad Hanif Atmar, with whom he and his counterparts still confer as representatives of Kabul\u2019s \u201clegitimate government\u201d in weekly online Zoom meetings.\n\u201cNo one has told us to take down our flag,\u201d he said, pointing to the ensign the Islamic Republic used before the Taliban takeover. \u201cWe are in a limbo situation where no one recognises the Taliban, but how long that will go on for, no one knows.\u201d\nWestern powers have not recognised the Taliban\u2019s recently announced government, and its foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, has yet to nominate any representatives to replace Afghanistan\u2019s contingent of ambassadors abroad if diplomatic relations are established. As a result, its overseas missions remain in the hands of pro-western career diplomats astounded by the course of events in their homeland, unsure of how they will survive financially and holding meetings with officials who have fled the country.\nSamadi, whose wife is a prominent women\u2019s rights activist, belongs firmly in that school. His time in Athens has been a wake-up call to the desperation that drives Afghans to seek refuge in Europe, often at great personal cost.\nEight months ago, the diplomat says, he too pressed the case for his compatriots not to embark on perilous journeys to Greece, long on the frontline of migrant and refugee arrivals from Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\u201cThe hardest part of my job is having to inform families of children who are found dead in the sea, or in the forests around the Greek-Turkish [land] border,\u201d he said. \u201cIn interviews with all the major TV channels in Afghanistan I encouraged people, back then, not to attempt to come illegally. I said please don\u2019t send your children on these dangerous journeys. But now circumstances are completely different.\u201d\nDescribing the situation as unique, he warned: \u201cIf countries close their borders it will be a human catastrophe \u2026 now is not the proper time for such a campaign, we have all seen the heartbreaking scenes.\u201d\nInstead, he said, all nations should be holding the Taliban to account because if the situation inside Afghanistan were to improve \u2013 with better job opportunities, security and freedom of expression for women, human rights activists and civil society \u2013 the desire to leave would diminish.\n\u201cNow is the time to make the Taliban accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Taliban don\u2019t enter negotiations with other Afghan political groups and agree to form a broad-based, inclusive government based on rule of law and respect for the rights of everyone then we should not be stopping but helping to get vulnerable people out.\u201d\nAfghans account for the largest number of asylum seekers in Greece \u2013 although the vast majority are headed on elsewhere \u2013 with an estimated 40,000 registered in the country.\nA nondescript building perched on an elevation in Athens\u2019 northern suburbs, the Afghan embassy was deluged daily by hundreds requiring passports and other documents to apply for refugee recognition status, prior to the pandemic.\n\u201cSo far only about 10,000 of the 40,000 here have had their requests processed,\u201d Samadi said. \u201cThe rest are still waiting. Over 95% arrive without documents and over 90% are in a very bad economic situation. They have sold everything, their clothes, properties, jewellery to make the journey.\u201d\nBefore the Greek campaign even gets off the ground there are questions as to whether it will have any effect. \u201cMigrants trust their own sources and have their own way of understanding things,\u201d said Gianluca Rocco, the chief of mission of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN migration agency, in Greece. \u201cThey don\u2019t listen so much to campaigns. Usually they trust their network of families and friends more than messages from governments of Europe.\u201d\nSince the fall of Kabul, Greece \u2013 which also took part in US-led evacuation efforts in August \u2013 has taken in about 65 Afghan refugees, including six female MPs who arrived en route to being resettled with their families in the US. Athens\u2019 foreign ministry described them as \u201cdefenders of fundamental values, freedom of expression and gender equality\u201d.\nSamadi said he could sympathise with the domestic pressure the Greek government faced but that it was also up to the EU to stand up for the core values it represented.\n\u201cThousands [of refugees] have arrived here and I know Greece has challenges, but there should be a joint EU effort to address this common challenge,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cPeople in Afghanistan now are in a state of shock. But if the situation doesn\u2019t improve then definitely in the coming months, once winter has passed, there is a strong possibility of big migrant flows towards Greece and the EU.\u201d",

Daldry dedicated the win to the many men who lost their lives during the crisis. Star Andrew Burnap also beat out Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Hiddleston to win best leading actor in a play.\nMary-Louise Parker won best leading actress in a play for The Sound Inside, her second Tony award.\nThe Tonys, which have historically rewarded predominantly white actors and white creatives, reflecting an industry that has been overwhelmingly lacking in diversity, featured a slightly more diverse set of nominees than usual.\nAdrienne Warren was named best leading actress in a musical for Tina: The Tina Turner Musical, and David Alan Grier won his first Tony for best actor in a featured role in a play for A Soldier\u2019s Tale, which was also named best revival. Slave Play, which entered the night with 12 nominations, left the night empty-handed.\nCo-host Audra Macdonald, who was also nominated for best leading actress in a play, spoke about recent changes in the industry which will lead to \u201cmore awareness, action and accountability\u201d, which in turn will lead to more equity. In the 2017-8 season, 85.5% of directors, 61% of actors and nearly 80% of show writers were white, according to a report by the Asian American Performers Action Coalition. Groups and initiatives have been formed in the last year to push for more equality, and this season there are seven plays by Black writers \u2013 a record for Broadway.\nThere was also a special Tony handed to the Broadway Advocacy Coalition, a group dedicated to dismantling the systems that perpetuate racism through the power of storytelling. \u201cMoving forward requires calling out,\u201d said director Britton Smith in his speech. Later in the evening, BAC members Amber Iman and Adrienne Warren came on stage to speak about the importance of fighting back against \u201csystems of oppression\u201d, and the role that art has to play.\nLauren Patten won the Tony for best actress in a featured role in a musical for Alanis Morissette show Jagged Little Pill, playing a character that has recently been at the centre of controversy. Patten\u2019s character was originally gender nonbinary in the Boston iteration, but was changed to female for Broadway. A growing backlash recently led to an apology from the producers.\nIn her speech, Patten said \u201cwe are in the middle of a reckoning\u201d; she said she has engaged in conversations that were \u201cfull of honesty, empathy and a respect for our humanity\u201d. Diablo Cody, who won the best original screenplay Oscar for Juno in 2008, also won for best book of a musical for Jagged Little Pill.\nOther winners included 90-year-old Lois Smith for her role in The Inheritance, becoming the oldest performer to win an acting Tony; and Danny Burstein for his featured role in Moulin Rouge!, his first award after seven nominations. Technical awards were mostly won by A Christmas Carol and Moulin Rouge!\nThe truncated Broadway year \u2013 that saw theatres shuttered at the start of the pandemic \u2013 meant that only 18 plays and musicals were eligible compared with 34 in 2019. This led to the category for best leading actor in a musical only having one nominee and one winner: Aaron Tveit for Moulin Rouge!\nUnlike other recent awards ceremonies, such as the Emmys, audience members were required to wear masks for the duration of the show, in line with theatre protocol in New York. They were also required to show proof of vaccination, and only two winners at a time were allowed on stage. The night saw a standing ovation for an in-audience Chuck Schumer for helping the return of live theatre.\nSunday night\u2019s ceremony was split between Paramount+ and CBS, as yet another attempt to boost subscribers for the recently rebranded streaming platform. The majority of awards were handed out in a two-hour streaming special before a switch to the network for a performance-heavy final section, billed The Tony Awards Present: Broadway\u2019s Back!, with just three trophies remaining.\nThe night included appearances from stars including Jennifer Holliday singing And I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going from Dreamgirls, and David Byrne performing Burning Down the House from American Utopia, which also picked up a special award.\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical is expected to play on London\u2019s West End from 12 November. Plans for its Australian premiere at the Regent Theatre, Melbourne are still unknown, but producers are hoping for a November opening.",

The railway embankment along one side is brimming over with pink and white flowers. They float above the brambles, froth along the pathways and decorate the streamside. It\u2019s an absolute nightmare.\nWe roll up our metaphorical sleeves, pull down our actual ones, and get to work pulling them out. This is not our first work party, or even our second, but the rising tide of balsam makes our most strenuous efforts seem feeble.\nHimalayan balsam was introduced to the country in the mid-19th century. It quickly escaped whatever genteel herbaceous border it was confined to, making a break for it along whatever ditches or waterways it could. I\u2019d like to find something good to say about this invasive weed, but I\u2019m struggling. Bees love it, it\u2019s true, but only the more\u00a0common honey and bumblebees. It\u2019s no good at all for solitary bees, which rely on a\u00a0patchwork of understory plants for their nectar through the season. The balsam flowers in one great flush, shades out other plants very efficiently, reduces biodiversity and\u00a0weakens the soil.\nYou can pull out Himalayan balsam really easily, but the problem is not the roots. The problem is up top. Each plant, which can grow up to three metres high, is \u2013 by this point in the year \u2013\u00a0not only flowering but festooned with striped yellow-green seedpods, primed and ready, like tiny grenades, their pins already pulled. The lightest touch sets them off. A single plant can produce up to 800 seeds and shoot them over seven metres. No wonder the plant doesn\u2019t waste its energy on roots. Sure, it seems to say, help yourself! Knock yourself out! Plenty more where that came from.\nWe troop out of the field, hours later, having made, at best, a\u00a0small dent in the opposition army. Pouting prettily, the balsam lets rip its parting shot: another volley of seeds, spluttering like a fistful of mustard seeds in hot oil, the unmistakable sound of humans being given the brush-off.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

He talks about Hollywood\u2019s obsession with big names, his determination to portray \u2018real people\u2019 \u2013 and being accused of pretension\nInterviewing Mike Leigh is a daunting prospect, not because of his intimidatingly central plinth in the pantheon of British cinema \u2013 well, maybe a bit of that \u2013 but because he is extremely exacting. You just couldn\u2019t work the way he does \u2013 his scripts are improvised, not written, resting on collaboration, trust, instinct, bravery \u2013 without weighing every word, cross-examining every sentence. Otherwise it would just be baggy. He takes this perfectionism into every interview, every conversation: Mike Leigh on Mike Leigh, a close textual and visual reading of his life\u2019s work by Amy Raphael, reissued next month, bristles with this energy.\nThen there\u2019s the incredible range of his output: since 1971, he has not just been making films and TV dramas, but breaking and recasting the expectations of form and genre. It bugs him when people always talk about the same few works \u2013 Abigail\u2019s Party, Life Is Sweet, Secrets & Lies \u2013 and neglect the films of which he is equally proud \u2013 Peterloo, or Meantime, a magnificent 1983 exploration of the hard edges of Thatcherism, which maybe didn\u2019t launch, but certainly put a rocket under, the careers of Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. The British Film Institute (BFI) has a retrospective this autumn that includes every film he has ever made \u2013 \u201cincluding the Play for Todays\u201d, he says, as if the world has finally recognised that you have to watch them all, like film-Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 and a remastered Naked, which will go on general release in November.\nIn person, he is so warm and curious that, even though it\u2019s true about his unsparing nature, you don\u2019t really feel unspared; it wasn\u2019t until I read back the interview transcript that I realised how often I got told off. I wonder if the success and originality of his method, going to the brink of an actor\u2019s mind for the intuitively truest line, might be rooted in this: people who can be frank in an affectionate way can say almost anything.\nWe meet in central London in Soho House, the private members\u2019 club on the same street as his erstwhile office, which he recently gave up because of the pandemic. Leigh loves and hates the fact that even now, at 78, with three Baftas and a Palme d\u2019Or, and countless nominations for every other prize, he is still the scrabbly outsider he was when he started out. He hates it because it means he really has to sweat blood to raise money, yet loves it as a badge of his independence.\n\u201cMy late producer, Simon Channing Williams, dead for about 10 years, would come back from meetings with potential backers, Americans, and say: \u2018They don\u2019t care that there\u2019s no script, they don\u2019t care that you can\u2019t say what it\u2019s about, but they will insist on the name, meaning an American movie star.\u2019 And we\u2019d walk away. Every project I\u2019ve ever done has been embarked upon on the watertight understanding: leave me to it, and everybody involved, and we\u2019ll deliver this work.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s been historical and we could say: \u2018This is about Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019 [Topsy Turvy]. Or: \u2018This is about the Peterloo massacre.\u2019 Or whether \u2013 like nearly everything else \u2013 it\u2019s been: \u2018We can\u2019t tell you anything about it, just give us some money.\u2019 Provided they accepted those conditions, and they have, it [the relationship between Leigh and his backers] has not been an issue.\u201d\nJust that point on casting is a radical act: when producers want a big name, with a few exceptions, that means one thing. Movie stars have to be movie-star handsome; in Leigh\u2019s films, sometimes actors are beautiful, sometimes they aren\u2019t, and sometimes they are, but only from some angles. Timothy Spall would never be described as a classic leading man, yet he has been the hero, to the extent that these ensemble works have heroes, in six Leigh films. It\u2019s hard to imagine Abigail\u2019s Party, the exploration of class and suburbia that rocked 1977 in mirth and dispute, peopled by perfect, symmetrical faces.\nIt\u2019s hard not to connect this to the depth of the performances in Leigh\u2019s work, not because ordinary-looking people are better at acting than beautiful ones, but because it\u2019s just a numbers game: you have a much larger, more varied pool of talent if not everyone has to have a ski slope nose. Photogenia, Leigh says, \u201cis one culture, and I\u2019m creating a different culture. I\u2019m concerned with real people out there in the streets.\u201d\nThe debate about Abigail\u2019s Party \u2013 it was mainly critically acclaimed, the argument more of an internecine playwright-on-playwright skirmish \u2013 was whether or not it conveyed \u201crancid disdain, for it is a prolonged jeer, twitching with genuine hatred, about the dreadful \u2026 lower middle classes\u201d, in the memorable phrase of Dennis Potter. Does Leigh view suburbia with contempt? Are his portrayals of the working class patronising? What about his own background? Did he even belong on the kitchen-sink or angry young man scene when his father was a doctor, and therefore he was middle class and grew up nowhere near the margins?\nThese charges have ebbed and flowed for the past 40 years, and he has always greeted them a little irascibly. We come at the conversation circuitously, chatting about Michael Ashcroft\u2019s biography of Keir Starmer: \u201cThe poor bugger was being accused of the most ridiculous things.\u201d (Ashcroft\u2019s fundamental charge is that Starmer isn\u2019t as working class as he makes out.) \u201cI think I resonate with some aspects of that. I\u2019ve got a long history of being accused of pretension \u2013 that I was affecting to be working class. It so happens that I grew up in a very working-class area, because we lived over my dad\u2019s surgery. And I went to a very working-class school, Salford grammar. But I\u2019ve never affected to be anything other than what I am.\u201d\nIrresistibly, when there\u2019s a retrospective of this depth, one is drawn to consider not just the films alone or their trajectory, but also how they fell at the time they were released, and how they are likely to be interpreted today.\nNaked, released in 1993, was the focus of a complicated ire for its gender politics. The film centres on Johnny, played by David Thewlis at his most committed, who roams about, hating everyone, but women more than men; he is violent, pretentious, but also powerfully disappointed. The crushing sadness of the character almost redeems him, but in a complicated way. You couldn\u2019t draw a neat map of which bits have been redeemed.\nThere was a degree of feminist backlash \u2013 one writer hated it because she found the female characters doormatty, and many were angered by the sexual violence (there\u2019s also a rapist landlord). Both then and watching it again now, I didn\u2019t object to the misogynist violence \u2013 it\u2019s problematic when it\u2019s done aesthetically, or erotically, not when it\u2019s the unlovely brutality in a story about misogynist violence \u2013 but I could see the ambiguities that would at least open up a discussion about where its moral compass was.\nLeigh can\u2019t see that at all. \u201cThere was a screening at [the north London cinema] Screen on the Green. And I went on to do a Q&A and I got jumped on by a bunch of feminists. What they weren\u2019t ready for were Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp and Claire Skinner and Deborah MacLaren, all of whom were in the film, all of whom are nothing if not feminists. You couldn\u2019t make the film with actresses who were not feminists. They jumped up and gave them a bloody mouthful. That was in 1993. At the end of the decade, there was none of that. I think people now will get what it really is. I think they\u2019ll read the central character, Johnny, in an intelligent way.\u201d\nLeigh now rationalises his improvised scripts in a wry, workmanlike way. \u201cYes, it is about going on a creative journey to discover what it is that you are doing. That isn\u2019t to say people who write conventional scripts don\u2019t do that. Except that when it comes to movies in particular, as we know, you can write the most brilliant script in the world, but then everybody else is there to fuck it up. So they\u2019re going to collaborate whether you like it or not. You might as well do it deliberately.\u201d He treads a delicate path between ceding himself utterly to that process, and being completely in charge of it. \u201cTo say I\u2019m not a control freak at all would be preposterous. You have to be a control freak,\u201d he says. Yet he never talks about any of his films at any length without mentioning a particular performance, or the set designer (Alison Chitty was his mainstay), or someone else, always by name.\nWhere he\u2019s not delicate at all is in his hatred of rules and compromise, which sounds fearless turned upon a faceless executive producer, but different \u2013 less fearless, a bit Daily Express \u2013 when turned on wokeness, although the word itself doesn\u2019t come up. \u201cNot wanting to drag myself into the quagmire of these issues, I am predictably irritated by box-ticking on political correctness. I\u2019m concerned about young film-makers. They have a hell of a bloody time, being told what they can and can\u2019t do, that they ought to have different kinds of people working with them, different subject matters. Nobody disagrees about diversity. But when it becomes prescriptive, that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nI was quite surprised, since the question I thought I\u2019d asked, obviously not very well, was about Britishness, his long fascination with the minute differences in class and outlook that become cavernous when characters are juxtaposed. It\u2019s striking how often his films have a greater impact abroad \u2013 in France and the US, in particular \u2013 than in the UK, but he doesn\u2019t find that especially interesting. \u201cMy work is rooted here, in our culture, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s primarily about. It\u2019s about humanity.\u201d\nSecrets & Lies, which is an incredible portrait of an adopted optometrist tracing her birth mother, did especially well in the US and, commercially and internationally, is his most successful film. \u201cAs much as anything, that\u2019s because tracing your birth is illegal in 50 of the 52 United States. In many countries, it remains illegal. So it\u2019s not just about me and my brand, it\u2019s about the specifics.\u201d Just as the wind is in his sails on a film that did particularly well \u2013 his 2014 painter-biopic Mr Turner, for example, saw some of the best reviews of his career \u2013 partway through, he\u2019ll recall some work that was less well received, or languished in partial obscurity, and make the diversion to talk about that.\nHe sees his films as though they are his children \u2013 not with a progenitor\u2019s narcissism, that they are all perfect, but rather that it genuinely troubles him when the world prefers some over others. The intimate, familial atmosphere that he brings to his creative process might seem to make sense of how many of his leading actors he has been married to \u2013 well, one, Alison Steadman, and a long-term relationship with Marion Bailey \u2013 but actually the relationships are the normal bit; the unusual bit is how well he can work with people he\u2019s married, during and after. \u201cI\u2019m very professional. They\u2019re very professional. We talk the language of what we\u2019re doing. And, of course, the process might sometimes be between me and the actress, but most of it is about everyone working together.\u201d As if to land this point, he adds: \u201cI worked with Alison Steadman after we ceased to be together.\u201d And then concludes: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very relevant matter,\u201d although whether he\u2019s talking to me or himself is not completely plain.\nCovid wrecked his recent projects \u2013 there is no way he could have made \u201csocially distanced\u201d work. \u201cIt takes time to develop a scene, time and patience, long improvisations in character, allowing things to just stay a little too long, not trying to make anything happen. This can result in fantastically boring improvisation, but that\u2019s part of the organic growth.\u201d He won\u2019t tell me what his next project is. He won\u2019t tell me why he won\u2019t tell me. Does he think he\u2019ll be working till his deathbed? \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be working after I\u2019ve died.\u201d This answer, something in his manner tells me, is a work in progress.\n A new edition of Faber\u2019s Mike Leigh on Mike Leigh is available from 7 October.

        "content": "Largest major survey of its kind finds 70% of respondents first saw child sexual abuse material when they were under 18\nThe largest major survey of people who watch online child sexual abuse has found that one-third of respondents attempted to directly contact a child as a result of the illegal images they watched online.\nThe survey, by Protect Children, a Finnish human rights group, was posted on the \u201cdark web\u201d so users would find it while actively searching for illegal content of children. The analysis was based on more than 5,000 people who responded initially to the survey about why and how they watched children being abused online, although 10,000 responses have been received so far.\nAnother key finding was that 70% of those who answered said they first saw child sexual abuse material when they were under 18. Of those, 40% said they were under 13 when first exposed to illegal images of children.\nMore than 50% of those who admitted to watching online child abuse said they were not seeking these images out when they were first exposed to illegal material.\nWhen asked what sort of material they looked for, 45% said it was girls between the ages of four and 13, while only 18% said they looked at boys. The others said they watched \u201csadistic and violent\u201d material or images of toddlers.\nSusie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, which works to remove illegal images from the web, said: \u201cThat a significant number of people say they first viewed harmful material when they were less than 13 years old is truly staggering.\n\u201cPeople think watching these videos is a victimless crime. But those are real children and they are having real and cruel sexual abuse inflicted upon them. On top of that, the victims have to live with the knowledge that images of them suffering are being shared again and again by predators.\u201d\nProtect Children wanted to learn about the habits of the growing number of people around the world who get sexual gratification from watching children being abused.\nIn order to reach offenders the questionnaire was placed on the dark web, so that users could fill it in without fear of being tracked by the police. It was tagged with code words usually used to mark child abuse material so that people would stumble across it while looking for illegal images and videos.\nThe charity also posted a separate survey asking questions for those who did not want to stop accessing images of child sexual abuse, which gathered an additional 3,000 answers.\nAnna Ovaska, a legal specialist at Protect Children, said: \u201cWe started in December last year and expected, if we were lucky, 200 people might reply, but we have recently passed 10,000 replies [in total].\n\u201cWe wrote the questionnaire in English and Spanish but we have had lengthy answers in other languages, including Russian, Arabic and Chinese. After eight months people are still answering. We realised people need to talk and that the survey was itself working as an intervention.\u201d\nNina Vaaranen-Valkonen, the executive director of Protect Children and a psychotherapist who works with adults who have been sexually abused as children, said the charity would use the results to encourage offenders to change their behaviour.\n\u201cThe unfortunate reality is that most of these individuals watching and sharing abusive material online will never be caught or arrested,\u201d she said. \u201cWe needed insight into the thoughts, behaviours and emotions of users so that we can create self-help programmes.\u201d\nIn anonymised quotes, offenders said they often felt shame and wished they could stop what they were doing, saying things like \u201cthis is the first time I have typed about a constant problem in my head\u201d. Approximately half of the respondents have at some point experienced thoughts about self-harm or have attempted suicide in relation to watching child abuse.\nThe growth in online child abuse is enormous. In the UK alone about 850 people, nearly all men, are arrested every month for offences linked to online child abuse. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the report findings match what they are seeing.\nSarah Blight, deputy director at the NCA said: \u201cThe NCA is seeing a direct link between online offending and contact abuse. In the UK we estimate that there are between 550,000 and 850,000 UK-based individuals posing various degrees of sexual risk to children \u2013 a figure which has grown in line with increased online activity.\u201d\nThe report has raised vital questions for those trying to protect children. The majority of those who responded said that they had tried to stop watching, but had struggled.\nVaaranen-Valkonen said this shows that intervention can work: \u201cTherapy can change behaviour. This is known and understood from decades of research. The scale of the online child abuse situation globally is a public health crisis and in answer it is vital to adopt a public health approach.\u201d\n In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331. In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

        "content": "New research into performance under pressure among tennis players shows the biggest names do not just rise to the occasion on the biggest points\nEmma Raducanu is already proving a master of changing the narrative. At Wimbledon some questioned her temperament after she pulled out of her fourth-round match with breathing difficulties. Two months on, those critics were made to eat their words after her stunning US Open victory in the Big Apple.\nShe was at it again at a homecoming event at the National Tennis Centre on Friday, showing her ruthless side by revealing she had dispensed with the services of her coach in New York, Andrew Richardson. Of course, it was the right decision. Richardson was on a short-term contract and has little experience of the WTA tour. And, even at 18, Raducanu is old enough to know that fairytales can soon be shredded by the cut-throat world of professional sport.\nBut Raducanu also said something that was worthy of attention when asked what she had done to cope better mentally between struggling against Ajla Tomljanovic at Wimbledon \u2013 when one unforced error spiralled into another and then another \u2013 and the US Open, where she was as hard as granite.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty resilient and when down, or facing adversity, I feel like I bounce back pretty quickly and don\u2019t let that disappointment affect me,\u201d she said. But how about when you hit an unforced error on a big point at the US Open, how do you try to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again? \u201cI just try to acknowledge what happened in that shot and don\u2019t repeat the mistake,\u201d she replied.\nPsychologists have a phrase for that \u2013 \u201cexpertise-induced amnesia\u201d, which is used to describe the automatic and non-conscious nature of skilled performance. And it perhaps helps explain why Raducanu was able to cope so well with the odd sticky moment in New York.\nI learned about this from a fascinating new study, \u201cPsychological pressure and compounded errors during elite-level tennis\u201d, which looked at more than 650,000 points played in every men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles match at the 12 grand slams from 2016 to 2019 to try to better understand the persistent puzzle surrounding who copes, and who chokes, under pressure.\nFor every point the team of academics from the University of Exeter and Royal Holloway asked two key questions: what was the level of pressure on the players, and did they hit a winner, unforced error or double fault? If, for instance, a player was 40\u201330 down on their own serve at 5-4 in the deciding set, this would create the maximum pressure score, compared with a much lower one if a player was 5-0 up and coasting.\nSo what did they find? First, that the unforced error rate for the highest-pressure points was much greater than the low-pressure points \u2013 by 1.75 times, in fact. That was not a surprise. Nor perhaps is the revelation that when a player made an unforced error the chances of them doing so again significantly increased on subsequent points.\nHowever, more intriguingly, the researchers also found that these two effects also interact to create a \u201ccycle of pressure \u2013 mess up, more pressure, mess up again\u201d, as one of the authors, Dr David Harris, explained to me.\nThis is interesting. In sport, we hear a lot about the \u201chot hand\u201d \u2013 where a successful shot leads to another, then another, and suddenly the commentator is screaming \u201cHe\u2019s on fire\u201d and the player can\u2019t seem to miss.\nHowever, the academics tentatively suggest that might be more evidence for the \u201ccold hand\u201d theory \u2013 where errors and negative brain chatter lead to more mistakes and a downward spiral.\nThe research contains another interesting finding. The biggest names in men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis are often reckoned to be more \u201cclutch\u201d under pressure \u2013 in other words, they play even better when the stakes are higher. But the academics found little evidence of that happening.\nNaturally, successful players had a better ratio of winners to unforced errors across all points. \u201cHowever, for higher pressure points the distributions of winners to unforced errors for successful/unsuccessful players was very similar to the overall distributions,\u201d the academics noted, \u201cindicating that successful players simply maintained their general advantage under pressure and did not somehow \u2018raise their game\u2019.\u201d Similar patterns have been found in the NBA, with players thought to be \u201cclutch\u201d not actually improving their shooting percentage in the last five minutes of games, although they did take more shots which may have altered perceptions.\nSo what is the best strategy for coping? As the academics note, \u201cthe benefits of pre\u2011shot routines for performing under pressure are varied and not fully understood\u201d. However, Raducanu\u2019s point-by-point approach to coping with pressure is remarkably similar to how Annika S\u00f6renstam, one of the most successful golfers of all time on the Ladies PGA tour, responded to mistakes.\nIn interviews, the Swede has said she barely remembered making an error on the course. Instead, after a bad shot she conducted a brief analysis of her mistake, before moving on to focus on the \u201cnow shot\u201d.\nRaducanu\u2019s approach is certainly on the same page. \u201cWhen I was younger I would get quite upset and emotional on the court, and I got that knocked out of me pretty quickly,\u201d she told us on Friday. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t like that, so from a young age I\u2019ve just had this mindset and stayed very calm.\u201d Whisper it softly to Piers Morgan, but so far it appears to be working.",

Eighteen months ago, Scottish Ballet leapt off stage while touring in America to race home and lock themselves indoors. They\u2019ve returned with Starstruck, a glitzy revival of Kelly\u2019s ballet that hopes to mark that comeback with a bang \u2013 and in this, they succeed.\nIn Pas de Dieux, the gods Zeus and Aphrodite \u2013 accompanied by the mischievous Eros \u2013 descend from Mount Olympus to the balmy south of France. A few meddling arrows, fistfights and broken hearts later, all ends well with mortal and godly lovers correctly reunited. Artistic director Christopher Hampson worked with Kelly\u2019s widow, Patricia Ward Kelly, to reconstruct the ballet by deciphering Kelly\u2019s scribbled annotations on George Gershwin\u2019s score and sifting through archive photographs and rehearsal footage.\nHampson adds a well-situated prologue that frames Kelly\u2019s ballet from within the rehearsal room of shiny, legging-clad men and star-struck ballerinas. The ritual of ballet class after so long away feels apt rather than conceited, and the subsequent blur between on- and off-stage relationships throughout the show creates a nice dramatic texture.\nThe company apply themselves to the jazzy numbers with rigour, if not complete abandon: soloist Bruno Micchiardi as the Pianist/Eros is brilliantly emphatic as he springs across the stage. Evan Loudon as the Choreographer/Zeus traverses his kingdoms with impeccably high jumps and long extensions, though he is always drawn to Sophie Martin\u2019s commanding Star Ballerina/Aphrodite.\nLez Brotherston\u2019s design (inspired by Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 original ideas) does a lot of heavy lifting in navigating the audience through new scenarios. The rehearsal room is stripped back to wheeled mirrors and studio lights, the beach indicated through a lifeguard\u2019s towering platform, yet a camp opulence still infectiously infuses the production.\nThe ballet itself runs out of steam in the final act: while the ensemble numbers continue to enthral, it\u2019s uncertain whether they\u2019ll end in five or 50 minutes. But it\u2019s an enjoyable enough look into the past, with plenty of fizz to propel you back into the theatre.\nAt Eden Court, Inverness, from 30 September-2 October. Then touring.",

We have seen an absolutely unprecedented number of orders come in. Come Christmas, if you leave ordering your turkey from your local farm supplier, you are going to be out of luck.\u201d\nOn whether Brexit was to blame, Martin said: \u201cWe\u2019re small producers, we use local labour, but for the big processors it is 100% caused by a labour shortage. This situation with turkeys is caused by the fact that European labour is no longer available to us, and they are skilled workers who have been coming to us for years.\n\u201cPeople are now missing a whole host of their workforce that they have been training and investing in over the last however many years, and those workers are no longer available for us to use on a seasonal basis \u2013 they will go find work on mainland Europe instead.\u201d\nConsumers have also been warned of a potential shortage of Christmas trees and higher prices as supply chain difficulties spread \u2013 and post-Brexit trading rules have been blamed.\nMark Rofe, who owns ChristmasTrees.co.uk, said last week that UK growers were reporting higher demand for locally grown conifers, \u201cespecially from clients who would usually import their trees from Europe, but are keen to avoid any red tape that could increase costs or cause delays for what is of course a highly seasonal and time-sensitive business\u201d.\nFilling the space under the tree could also be trickier this year, and more expensive, as toy retailers report delays and higher prices shipping goods into the UK from manufacturers in Asia.\nLast month, the British Poultry Council reported that there were nearly 7,000 vacancies across the sector, leading some chicken producers to cut their output, and leading to shortages at the restaurant chains Nando\u2019s and KFC.\nProducers have said they could opt to rear fewer birds, fearing they would not have the extra staff needed to process them in time for Christmas.\nOn Saturday night the UK government said it would issue temporary visas to 5,500 poultry workers and 5,000 HGV drivers to help the food and fuel industries with shortages.\nUK business groups have said the plan will not address the country\u2019s critical labour shortages, which are threatening to disrupt Christmas and leading to delays supplying fuel to some petrol stations and panic buying.\nRuby McGregor-Smith, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government should have drawn up a plan to help businesses handle Brexit from the outset. \u201cInstead, the supply of EU labour was turned off with no clear roadmap as to how this transition would be managed without disruption to services and supply chains,\u201d she said.\nLady McGregor-Smith said the UK was not offering enough temporary visas. \u201cEven if these short-term opportunities attract the maximum amount of people allowed under the scheme, it will not be enough to address the scale of the problem that has now developed in our supply chains,\u201d she said. \u201cThis announcement is the equivalent of throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire.\u201d\n This article\u2019s headline was amended on 27 September 2021 to be consistent with editorial guidelines.",

Paraguay, which has no coast and relies on its rivers for countless social, environmental, and commercial services, faces dire strain.\n\u201cParaguay is a landlocked country, and the river is an artery in its body that it depends on to live,\u201d said Krivenchuk.\nJuan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz, director of Paraguay\u2019s National Shipping and Ports Administration Body (ANNP) said river transport is central to an economy primarily based on genetically modified soy exports.\n\u201cWe export commodities with zero added value: totally raw materials. River transport is by far the cheapest way of reaching international markets,\u201d he said.\nThe world\u2019s third-largest river fleet moves 96% of Paraguay\u2019s international imports and exports along two great waterways, the Paran\u00e1 and the Paraguay, to and from ports in Argentina and Uruguay.\nThe Paraguay River, which flows past Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s office in the capital Asunci\u00f3n, has dropped to its lowest ever level, further than the previous all-time low reached in 2020. With costs escalating, Mu\u00f1oz said the shipping sector faces a loss of 20% of revenue \u2013 $100 million \u2013 for the second year running despite dredging initiatives.\nThe government \u2013 which declared a state of emergency on the Paran\u00e1 in July \u2013 has already raised the alarm over rising prices of imported products.\nRoger Monte Domecq, hydrology professor at the National University of Asunci\u00f3n, said that while cyclical droughts are normal in the Paran\u00e1 Basin, there is increasing evidence that human-driven factors intensify the crisis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that there\u2019s an impact on the climate, which affects conditions all across the region,\u201d he said.\nMonte Domecq said more studies were required to ascertain the exact impacts of global heating and extremely high levels of deforestation and land-use change seen across the region, especially in the Amazon where the water cycle which feeds precipitation in the Paran\u00e1 Basin is being disrupted.\nThe CAF\u2013Development Bank of Latin America lists Paraguay as the country most vulnerable to the climate emergency in South America.\nIt has also seen enormous deforestation. Only 7% of the Atlantic forest that until recent decades covered the country\u2019s east remains, and the western Chaco forest faces some of the world\u2019s highest deforestation rates.\nDeforestation has principally been caused by state-propelled soybean and cattle ranching booms; both sectors that are now struggling to export their products downriver.\nAnd there is no end to the drought in sight, said Monte Domecq: no significant rains are forecast for coming months and the weather phenomenon known as La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 which brings dry weather to the Paran\u00e1 Basin \u2013 is looming.\nDownriver from Port Trociuk in the fishing town of Ayolas, fisherman Claudio Dom\u00ednguez described excruciating economic difficulties for ordinary families as he gathered bait in the shallows.\n\u201cThere are barely any fish \u2026 really nothing. It\u2019s been like this for four months,\u201d he said.\nFishers are making ever-longer journeys \u2013 involving escalating fuel costs \u2013 in the hope of a catch.\nJust upriver from Ayolas, production of electricity at the mighty Yacyret\u00e1 dam, which Paraguay shares with Argentina, is also affected. Yacyret\u00e1 and Itaip\u00fa \u2013 an even larger dam on the Paran\u00e1 shared with Brazil \u2013 produce almost all Paraguayan electricity and according to the government, Itaip\u00fa has come close to shutting down due to the low waters.\nMercedes Canese, energy consultant and former deputy energy minister, said that, while Paraguay is not suffering energy shortages \u2013 it uses only a small portion of its energy from the two giant dams \u2013 it is losing an important part of $1.57bn in yearly exports of excess energy to its giant neighbours.\nAnd as the water shortages cause Brazilian energy prices to soar, many Paraguayans say that a historical injustice is being deepened. Paraguay is obliged by treaty to sell excess energy from the Itaip\u00fa dam to Brazil at cost price, a condition that economist Miguel Carter calculates cost Paraguay $75.4bn from 1985 to 2018.\n\u201cPrices in Brazil are sky-high, but Paraguay can\u2019t sell its energy at market prices,\u201d Canese said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\nOn Ayolas\u2019s beach, Claudio Dom\u00ednguez points to a wet line in the sand indicating the Paran\u00e1\u2019s level just hours before. He cleans his bait and hurriedly prepares for an all-night fishing trip that he hopes will not be unrewarded \u2013 as so many others have been.\nIn the town square, a singer serenades the crowd with Oraci\u00f3n del Remanso, a folk song about Paran\u00e1 fishers, during a festival that evening: \u201cChrist of the fishing nets, don\u2019t abandon us.\u201d\n\u201cEverything depends on the river. We all depend on it,\u201d Dom\u00ednguez said.",

He is believed to be the only Pashto speaking psychiatrist in the north. It\u2019s the language most commonly spoken by the Taliban in the region.\nHis family said Alemi had received several threatening calls and messages in the months before he was abducted. One chilling message, sent on 21 June and seen by the Guardian, said: \u201cYou will be killed soon.\u201d\nAlemi is a prominent figure in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan\u2019s fourth-largest city. As well as opening the hospital, he has also built a secondary school in the city, equipped with a library and laboratory.\nHis daughter, Manizheh Abreen, said her father was being driven home last Monday when the men stopped the vehicle and ordered the driver, Basir, out of the car. They told Alemi to get out of the car and go with them to answer questions at a local police station. \u201cThey forcefully pushed him into their car and fled away. They stopped him where there were no CCTV cameras installed and they knew it already,\u201d said Abreen.\nThe family said they do not know who was responsible for the kidnapping and have not received a ransom note.\nAlemi\u2019s son, Dr Fardeen Alemi, said: \u201cOur main concern is that my father is suffering from diabetes and he needs to take regular insulin. We are extremely devastated about this situation. My father has only done sincere service towards the community and he is a brilliant psychiatrist and helped people in need.\n\u201cHe has always held this idea that I have to serve the people and that\u2019s why he never left his country,\u201d he said.\nThe family said there is no active, formal government presence in Mazar-i-Sharif, and fear Alemi\u2019s abduction will not be properly investigated.\nDr Khan Murad Muradi, one of the doctors in Alemi\u2019s neuro-psychiatric hospital, said: \u201cWe are all shocked and saddened by this horrible incident. He was a kind-hearted man and I don\u2019t think any doctor could treat patients in a situation like this. No one feels safe here in Mazar-i-Sharif.\u201d\nPatricia Gossman, associate Asia director for Human Rights Watch called on Afghan authorities to investigate the whereabouts of Alemi.\n\u201cIf he has been abducted then those responsible should be held accountable. The Taliban claim to be able to bring security, so they should properly investigate what happened and bring those responsible to justice, while also protecting the rights of those accused of any wrongdoing.\u201d\nOn Saturday, the Taliban killed four alleged kidnappers in Herat, hanging their bodies in public as a deterrent to others.",

I mean, why would you assert something that\u2019s not true. Why would you say, in legislation, that a cat is a dog or vice versa,\u201d she said.\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission president, Prof Rosalind Croucher, told the inquiry that the commission was concerned that the proposed bill would increase secrecy across 15 different acts, with the changes to the Freedom of Information Act of particular concern.\nCroucher said the legislation would represent a significant change from how the FoI Act applied to COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, which national cabinet had replaced.\n \u201cAustralians should be able to seek information about the nature of the decisions made by their representatives. This is even more important in times of emergency. When governments are provided with extraordinary powers then it can affect the lives and rights of Australians in significant ways,\u201d Croucher said.\n She said the proposed changes would involve \u201ca permanent change to confidentiality rules over public policy\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that emergency situations do not become a broad justification for unnecessary increases in executive power to the detriment of democracy,\u201d Croucher said.\n Isabelle Reinecke, the executive director of the Grata Fund, told the committee that Australia\u2019s freedom of information regime was already restrictive, and the proposed bill would make the situation worse.\n\u201cIf passed, the proposed amendment will see secrecy increase without appropriate justification, and to the detriment of the public good, and the quality of Australia\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said.\nAccountability Round Table chair Fiona McLeod, a respected barrister and also a former Labor candidate, said the bill in its current form was \u201cuntenable\u201d.\n\u201cThe bill subverts responsible government accountability and transparency, and the government\u2019s own commitment to the Open Government Partnership,\u201d McLeod said.\nLabor senator Tim Ayres also challenged the department\u2019s evidence to the committee, saying its submission that the national cabinet operated as a federal subcommittee of cabinet had already been rejected by Justice Richard White in his ruling.\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand why the department\u2019s coming back to us with the same argument, the same fiction, presented to his honour,\u201d Ayres said.\n The department said it had not appealed against the AAT decision, and was unable to say how much it had spent defending the government against Patrick\u2019s action.\nIn its submission to the inquiry, the Law Council of Australia argued that the existing FoI regime would stop the disclosure of information where necessary.\n\u201cAccepting that there is merit in encouraging candid discussion in national cabinet, it is not apparent that secrecy needs to extend to the topics discussed or the information presented to that body,\u201d its submission to the inquiry said.\n\u201cThat is because (unlike a true cabinet) national cabinet does not manage the budgets or policy agenda of a government and does not face the electorate every three to four years.\u201d\nThe government says the bill clarifies national cabinet is a committee of federal cabinet.\n\u201cMaintaining confidentiality over national cabinet information and discussions is critical to its effective operation and reflects the close relationship that national cabinet has to the federal cabinet,\u201d the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet\u2019s submission said.\n\u2013 With Australian Associated Press",

        "content": "The playwright pays tribute to the director\u2019s complex mind, sophistication and clairvoyant sense of what would work\nThe colossal heart of Roger Michell stopped beating last week, long before he was done with it. It was one tragic loss too many and his friends and collaborators are inconsolable. In a treacherous business, Rog was one of the very few you could count on. He exemplified loyalty. Once he\u2019d committed, he was behind you all the way, there would be no cold feet, no self-serving half-truths, career moves or better offers.\nHe prized new plays because he was more interested in creation than interpretation and had no real interest in drawing attention to himself. He pushed me to keep writing them, certain that a theatre legacy was the best kind, meeting up regularly to will another one out of me like an especially dedicated midwife. He believed theatre was medicinal, the elixir of life. Once he asked me when I was going to write \u201cthe big one\u201d and I felt ashamed for keeping him waiting.\nHe was a startlingly stylish and honest film-maker, woefully under-appreciated. His work blazed with a black wit and buoyant humanity. He knew his way around death and grief and madness because like all the best people he\u2019d encountered it in the world and taken notice, always adding to his generous store of empathy. He understood my work better than anyone did.\nWe made four plays, two films and one excellent song together but I still regret that I didn\u2019t write more for him. Trouble was, he was so damned choosy. If he liked something, then it was like Christmas. If he didn\u2019t, he could be so inadvertently withering that the idea would be crushed into oblivion. Such was my respect for him that I always took his word for it.\nIt was Rog who tactfully advised me not to cut the orange in Blue/Orange, when I\u2019d got it into my head that it was somehow not the point. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts,\u201d he offered succinctly. \u201cIt\u2019s called Blue-fucking-Orange. It\u2019s theatrical gold.\u201d Of course he was right, but I couldn\u2019t see it.\nHe was clairvoyant. He knew exactly how something was going to work or not work before you\u2019d even tried it. Occasionally we argued about it. I\u2019d want to include new dialogue at the last minute and he\u2019d give me a funny look.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cBecause it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d \n \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n \u201cI just know.\u201d\nHe had a complex mind and he understood complexity. He\u2019d ask me \u201cWhat are you trying to say with this? Give it to me in a nutshell,\u201d and I\u2019d ramble on until he found what he was looking for. \u201cThat bit. That\u2019s not in the play yet. You need to inject that into the play.\u201d Sometimes it was the best bit in the play.\nTechnique was key. He was always looking for cuts. He\u2019d often say, \u201cI love it but you need to cut the first 20 pages.\u201d\nOr, \u201cI like it but I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for. What does it do?\u201d\n Or, \u201cYou\u2019re too close to your subject. Sometimes you\u2019re better when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nMeeting with a famous actor once, who\u2019d been assured of the part, Rog suddenly sensed it wasn\u2019t going to work and devised a secret signal to get us out of it without hurting him. \u201cOK, the minute you think we should abort, I want you to move this coffee cup from here to here, very slowly, diagonally, then look out of the window. That way I\u2019ll know we\u2019re in agreement and I can let him down gently.\u201d\nAnybody else would have just left it to the reps.\nOne year I was clearly suffering after a bruising episode in my life and Roger gently advised me to write about it, because \u201cit might help\u201d. I wrote the play and he directed a fine, cathartic production, exceptionally technically difficult but ultimately a success. Just because he cared.\nWe travelled the world together, opening a film in New York, a play in the West End, teaching film-making in Cape Town. We only fell out once, and only then because we were trying too much, not too little. Sometimes we got the giggles, uncontrollably, or went off to drown our sorrows. He raised the most delightful children and was delightful to mine. He was an incredible and generous cook and lunches were a grand occasion, always with excellent French wine, decanted of course. He would ring on a Sunday to check all was well, signing his emails suavely, \u00e0 bient\u00f4t \u2026\nLosing him is like Christmas in reverse, all the gifts taken away, vanished mysteriously in the night, leaving a bomb crater. No more of the wisdom, sophistication and complexity. No more of the certainty, the exquisite judgment, the dexterity, the swing and timing of a great drummer, the shared vernacular, the compassion and empathy. No more easy assumptions that one\u2019s best work is yet to come. How could it be now?\nAs he stares out from his obituaries with quizzical amusement, it feels like another of his mischievous, immaculate theatrical illusions. He always knew the real praise would come too late and he had, typically clairvoyant, predicted it. \u201cLike Van Gogh,\u201d he once quipped, \u201cwithout the insanity.\u201d\n\u00c0 bient\u00f4t, old pal, the world is a duller, harsher place without you.",

        "content": "Suburb where Shameless was filmed is now home to Manchester Camerata, which is intent on serving the community\nOn paper, it may seem like an odd pairing: the Manchester Camerata, one of Europe\u2019s most renowned orchestras, and Gorton, the tough Manchester suburb where Shameless was filmed.\nThough a \u00a3100m regeneration project has bulldozed the boarded-up shops and grotty maisonettes that formed the backdrop to the chaotic Channel 4 show, the area is still among England\u2019s poorest. Almost 29% of Gortonians claim unemployment benefit, twice the English average. A disproportionate number of residents are in poor health and life expectancy is about five years shorter than the England average.\nGorton\u2019s older inhabitants will be among the first to benefit from the Camerata\u2019s decision to abandon its central Manchester home. Over the past year it has moved into a spectacular Victorian monastery in Gorton, which looms incongruously over a redbrick council estate, the pavement outside crunchy with broken glass.\nThe orchestra hopes the move will broaden its audience and bring what the musical director, G\u00e1bor Tak\u00e1cs-Nagy, calls \u201cthe spiritual medicine of music\u201d to an area of great disadvantage.\nAmong them is Ted Hennessey, who has spent all of his 82 years in Gorton. He worked as an engineer at Gorton\u2019s locomotive works, got married at Gorton monastery and went to the school next door.\nNow in a wheelchair and living alone after his wife died in 2018, Hennessey\u2019s mind is increasingly clouded by dementia. But as soon as his daughter wheels him into the monastery, the clouds clear. He smiles beneath his Manchester City face mask, remembering his wedding, in the year England won the World Cup.\nFifty-five years later, the 82-year-old has been back in the monastery for something that at first sounds unlikely: a songwriting session for people living with dementia. It went so well that his daughter, Pauline Rawlins, now calls him \u201cGorton\u2019s McCartney\u201d. She is delighted the Camerata has come to Gorton: \u201cUsually we don\u2019t get things like this here.\u201d\nAsked to brainstorm the theme of autumn, her dad mused that \u201cit comes and goes\u201d \u2013 a line the Camerata\u2019s musicians quickly improvised into a rather melancholic song, with percussion provided by the other participants and their carers, as well as music therapists.\nThe musicians find the unpredictability a thrill, says Ryan Breen, a tuba player. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really exciting. Yeah, you can go and do a prom, which is still exciting, but in a more fixed way.\u201d\nMany of those taking part can no longer live independently and are losing brain function fast. But the weekly music cafe, funded by Music For Dementia\u2019s Paul and Nick Harvey Fund, seems to wake up their minds and sometimes their feet: a dapper man called John, known in his care home as \u201cthe best dressed man in Manchester\u201d, waltzes his carer around the monastery, glowing in the stained-glass tinted light. His neighbour, the perma-grinning Brian, picks up the beat to offer a pitch-perfect rendition of his favourite song, Young Girl by Gary Puckett & The Union Gap.\nFor Ken Simpson, a youthful 79-year-old, it is a joy to dance with his wife, Mil, now 85, who has had dementia for five years. Eighteen months of pandemic-induced isolation has been tough, says Ken, who believes it may have accelerated Mil\u2019s concentration problems.\nThe Camerata is determined to deploy its world-class musicians in areas where their craft can \u201cmake the maximum impact,\u201d says Bob Riley, the orchestra\u2019s chief executive. Their work with dementia patients and other outreach initiatives aren\u2019t \u201cfluffy art projects\u201d but evidence-based programmes designed to work with partners in health, housing and beyond to effect \u201csocietal change\u201d, he says. There will be regular concerts, too: all free or heavily discounted for Gorton residents.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve displaced ourselves. We\u2019ve put ourselves outside of our comfort zone,\u201d said Riley. He hopes the monastery, a Grade II* listed building bought for \u00a31 in 1996 by volunteers who spent the next 11 years bringing it back from the brink of destruction, will prove the perfect home.\nOnce featured on the World Monuments Fund watch list of 100 most endangered sites in the world, alongside the Taj Mahal, Pompeii and the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, in recent years the monastery has largely been used for weddings and conferences.\nBut Elaine and Paul Griffiths, who led the renovation effort and now act as Gorton monastery\u2019s chief executive and chair, want the building to be used and treasured locally \u201cas the community asset the Franciscan monks built in 1872\u201d, said Riley. \u201cWe\u2019re a world-class orchestra, they have a world-class building, we are both charities in this city, so it made sense to come together and say: what can we do for and with the people here for the long-term health of our communities?\u201d\nThe pandemic has shown just how insular and elitist some orchestras have become, says Riley. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quite a lot of press over the last year from famous maestros saying: \u2018it\u2019s awful because we can\u2019t perform\u2019, rather than saying: \u2018it\u2019s awful, because we can\u2019t be there to serve our community.\u2019 Essentially, we are public servants.\u201d",

So this afterlife-for-kids animation gets points for recognising that thoughts about dying do rattle around in the four-year-old brain (along with unicorns, Hula Hoops and poo insults). The film begins with a show-offy young mouse called Whizzy being chased by timid fox Whitebelly; after a dazzling flash of headlights Whizzy and Whitebelly wake up in animal heaven. There\u2019s a nice moment when Whizzy realises she\u2019s dead. \u201cThat fox did get me,\u201d she says with wonder.\nThe animation \u2013 like Fantastic Mr Fox and Wallace and Gromit \u2013 is old-fashioned stop-motion puppetry (with a bit of assistance from CGI). It has that same deeply pleasing homemade aesthetic, as if you could reach in and touch every tuft of scruffy fur or knobbly twig.\nIn heaven, traditional foes mouse and fox must put aside their earthly animosities. Up here, there is no pecking order: even big-ticket predators make friends with the food. The film\u2019s Czech animators \u2013 it\u2019s dubbed, somewhat unimaginatively, into English \u2013 give us some quirky, colourful characters and gorgeous detail. There\u2019s a twinkly fairground and natural hot springs where newly deceased arrivals must wash.\nWhat\u2019s missing is anything resembling a storyline. Instead, some tiresome antics ensue as mouse and fox embark on a series of meaningless quests. They must complete a scary ride at the fairground and make it across a forest \u2013 learning all the usual caring-and-sharing kids-movie lessons. It\u2019s a shame that after that killer start, this wimps out of saying anything interesting about death or the adventure on the other side.\n Even Mice Belong in Heaven is released on 1 October in cinemas.",

In total, nine suppliers catering to nearly 2 million households between them have failed in 2021.\nEnergy experts at Barina Partners have said there may only be 10 suppliers left by the end of the winter, from 70 at the start of the year.\nOfgem is tasked with finding new suppliers when a company fails, under the \u201csuppliers of last resort\u201d system designed to prevent households being cut off.\nEd Kamm, the chief executive of Shell Energy Retail, said: \u201cWe\u2019re a well-capitalised supplier with long-term ambitions to help British households get to net zero emissions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear to Ofgem and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy that we are ready to play our part and help support customers of failed energy suppliers and work now turns to welcoming those customers of Green and ensuring they have the best experience they can.\n\u201cShell Energy will be working hard over the coming weeks to bring over all Green customers smoothly and swiftly. Green customers will receive 100% renewable electricity as standard as well as discounts on fuel via Shell Go Plus.\u201d\nKamm said Green customer\u2019s credit balances would be protected and their supply uninterrupted, adding that Green customers should expect contact from Shell in the coming days.\nNeil Lawrence, the Ofgem director of retail, said: \u201cWe understand that this news may be unsettling for customers, however they do not need to worry. Their energy supply will continue as normal, and customer credit balances will be honoured.\n\u201cShell Energy will be in contact with customers over the coming days with further information. Once the transfer has been completed, customers can switch if they wish to.\u201d\nThe UK\u2019s wholesale energy markets have reached record highs in recent weeks as multiple factors combined to send the market higher.\nThe trouble stems from a global surge in demand for gas after a cold winter that left gas storage facilities depleted, plus a rebound in post-lockdown energy demand across Asia. A race to refill gas stores before the return of colder temperatures has sent market prices surging.\nHalf of the UK\u2019s electricity is generated in gas-fired power plants. There has also been a higher than normal demand for gas power in recent months after a series of nuclear reactor outages and the recent shutdown of an important power cable that brings in electricity from France.\nThe UK has also had one of its least windy summers since 1961, meaning wind power has been low. Experts fear the situation will become worse as temperatures become colder.",

I was the impresario. My brothers, sisters and friends were assigned roles and we\u2019d have The Wicked Witch of the West fall in love with Captain Hook.\nWhen I moved to London in the early 1990s, I was rather lonely and isolated. Then the terrible murder of James Bulger happened and it was discovered that children had killed him. Everyone was asking: how could those boys be so villainous? Were they born evil or were there circumstances that pushed them towards behaving like that? It propelled me back to the question of evil that bedevils anybody raised Catholic.\nNo one says how The Wicked Witch of the West became as she was. She\u2019s just bad. I decided to tell her life as if Dickens was doing it. My novel would start with her birth, end with her death and have a 19th-century moral urgency. Within the first couple of days I got her name. I wanted to pay homage to The Wizard of Oz novelist L Frank Baum: LFB \u2013 Elphaba! It\u2019s clean and simple, but not pretty, and with connotations of otherworldliness. Even though I didn\u2019t anticipate that Wicked would become a musical, I thought Elphaba had to be able to sing in the novel. When writing, I cast the characters in my head so I could picture them: for Elphaba I cast kd lang.\nThe calls from Hollywood came within a week of publication. Whoopi Goldberg called, Demi Moore called. Universal developed it as a film for a while but weren\u2019t getting satisfactory scripts. This was before The Lord of the Rings, before Harry Potter. The studio was scared about paying $100m to make a fantasy movie with no big male roles.\nThen composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz met Universal executive Marc Platt and said the reason you\u2019re not getting a good script for this is because everyone knows that people in Oz sing. A straight film is not going to hit the heart like a musical does. Bankrolling a Broadway play is also a lot cheaper than a big movie \u2013 and all the film studios were watching Disney mint money on the stage with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast. Universal wanted in.\nStephen understood what the book is about: identifying with someone who was ostracised. He said the first number would be called No One Mourns the Wicked. With those words, he sold the project to me. He knew I had not written Wicked to be a parody of The Wizard of Oz but that I wanted to honour and unpack that story instead. The biggest change they made was to my ending. I felt a little aghast but came around to it because the messages remain the same: time is short, cherish who you love, and what you do matters.\nWhen we first tried out Elphaba\u2019s green makeup, I went to show the rest of the cast and everyone was gawking at me \u2013 all of a sudden I felt isolated, which was helpful for her characterisation. Originally, the makeup was an airbrush spray, but that would have been kind of toxic for eight shows a week so we chose a different product and used brushes. The ritual of putting on my makeup became meditative, something soothing before going on.\nWomen can be trepidatious about leaning into our full power and rage. We are taught to repress it. Elphaba has all of that inside her and is trying to navigate her pain. I can be very sensitive and afraid of my own anger, afraid of expressing myself for fear of pushing people away. I could relate to Elphaba\u2019s antisocial behaviour and to her being reclusive. As much as I\u2019m a performer and I work in the spotlight, there\u2019s another side to me that is quieter and likes to be wrapped up at home.\nIt\u2019s thrilling to create a brand new musical and awe-inspiring to see what the creative people do to make a show come to life. The flying was exciting but also scary, complex and distracting to my singing. Doing the show in London, after Broadway, was wonderful. I\u2019d dreamed my whole life of being in a West End play and I was able to feel more relaxed because I\u2019d done it in New York and knew how it affected people. Also, I knew I probably wasn\u2019t going to get fired!\nEveryone had said British audiences would be more reserved but it was the total opposite \u2013 a love fest. The Brits and Aussies in the cast were very adept at learning how to perform at a high level but also enjoy themselves after the show. They were very good at educating me on how to do that. I think I was a little high strung in New York.\nI never tire of the number Defying Gravity and get to revisit it when I perform my own show around the world. Singing that song, I step back into the shoes of that character but also see where I am at. What am I going through, how do I still need to empower myself? I once performed it at the White House in front of President Obama, the first lady and their daughters. They were within spitting distance \u2013 I might even have actually spat on them. It takes a lot of air and breath and saliva to get those notes out.\nWicked is at the Apollo Victoria theatre, London.",

The home secretary, Priti Patel, has said those who breach the injunction will face imprisonment and unlimited fines.\nHowever, activists who organised and participated in Monday\u2019s roadblock said the disruptive protests would continue.\nSpeaking to Sky News, Craig Scudders, a spokesman for the group said: \u201cWe were told that if we went back on the M25 that we would be arrested, that we would face losing our savings, having our homes taken away and possibly spending years in prison. But we are on the right side of this argument.\nHe added: \u201cPriti Patel, I have a message for you \u2013 that we are going nowhere. There is going to be wave after wave of wave of protesters willing to spend time in prison and possibly lose their savings because this is an issue that is not going away.\u201d\nDr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol, who took part in Monday\u2019s roadblock, said she was \u201cdetermined to do everything\u201d to force change.\nShe said: \u201cThis is the fifth time I\u2019ve been here trying to block a motorway because the only way to get the government to listen is to disrupt things. I\u2019m really sorry but I\u2019m determined to do everything I can to make us safe and change society \u2026\u2026 we have to try.\u201d\nVictoria Lindsell, 66, a volunteer language teacher, said: \u201cWe all understand the frustrations, but this is the only way to make the government listen. We\u2019re incredibly sorry, we\u2019ve all been stuck in traffic jams, but to be inactive is a crime.\n\u201cI\u2019m wet through and I\u2019m cold, it\u2019s not my choice but I cannot have the responsibility and not do anything about it.\u201d\nInsulate Britain also wrote a letter to Patel saying more protests were to come.\nIt said: \u201cYou can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere. You can raid our savings. You can confiscate our property. You can deny us our liberty and put us behind bars.\n\u201cBut shooting the messenger can never destroy the message: that this country is going to hell unless you take emergency action to stop putting carbon into the air.\u201d\nThe protest infuriated the drivers\u2019 lobby. The London branch of the Alliance of British Drivers demanded action against what it called a \u201ccriminal conspiracy to repeatedly block roads\u201d.\nHoward Cox, the head of FairFuelUK, tweeted that the the activists were \u201cscum\u201d who must be imprisoned and have assets stripped to pay for the disruption they caused.\nA spokeswoman for Insulate Britain denied activists were trying to worsen the petrol crisis: \u201cThis campaign is happening against a backdrop of a fuel crisis. I don\u2019t know that we are trying to exploit it. We set out three weeks ago and said we would continue until the government take responsibility for insulating homes. That continues to be the case.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cFrom what we are seeing the actual disruption is very minor.\n\u201cWe are more scared of the destruction of country than we are of an injunction, so people are prepared to face the consequences and continue with the campaign despite the injunction being in place.\u201d",

Police, apparently unaware that he was reporting to the probation services, assured her they would track him down.\nPublic shock at the violence of the attack turned to anger when a French newspaper revealed the police officer who took the victim\u2019s complaint had himself been convicted of domestic violence.\nAll of the police officers involved in the case, including a commissioner, two commanders and a brigadier, face being disciplined over a \u201cseries of failures\u201d in the police and legal chain, including a failure to take seriously the threat posed by Boutaa to his wife, the French radio station France Inter reported.\nChahinez Boutaa had not been informed that in December last year her husband had been released from prison on parole after serving six months of a nine-month sentence for a previous attack on her.\nFrance Inter said an internal police investigation found that the officer who handled the victim\u2019s complaint botched the procedure and did not record it correctly. He also reportedly made Chahinez Boutaa fill in a second form he should have completed himself, before sending the documents by email to the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Bordeaux without attaching the complaint.\nAccording to France Inter, the internal investigation also found that the detectives who should have been looking for Mounir Boutaa were busy tracking down an alleged rapist at the Bordeaux university campus. A second group of detectives tasked with finding the husband \u201cdid not have the required skills, and had to deal with several absentees due to Covid\u201d.\nIt added that even though Mounir Boutaa had been released from prison on probation and required to report in, probation officers who had been told he was wanted on further domestic violence accusations failed to detain him or report back to police that they had seen him twice.\nThe disciplinary procedure is likely to range from a reprimand to more serious action, but a police source told France Inter radio that \u201ctaken individually \u2026 these are not serious faults\u201d in the view of the interior ministry. The minister of justice has said it will take \u201corganisational measures to ensure that the observed failings do not happen again\u201d.\nChahinez Boutaa\u2019s death was the 39th femicide in France of the year. Since then, at least another 40 women have been killed by partners or ex-partners.",

The move follows revelations in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that Facebook had commissioned research showing Instagram could affect girls\u2019 mental health on issues such as body image and self-esteem.\nThe head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, defended the concept of an Instagram site for 10- to 12-year-olds and said he firmly believed children should be able to access a version of the app \u2013 which bars under-13s \u2013 that was designed for them.\n\u201cWhile we stand by the need to develop this experience, we\u2019ve decided to pause this project. This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today,\u201d he wrote in a blogpost.\n\u201cCritics of \u2018Instagram Kids\u2019 will see this as an acknowledgement that the project is a bad idea. That\u2019s not the case. The reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.\u201d\nMosseri\u2019s statement came one day after Facebook\u2019s head of research issued a rebuttal of the WSJ revelations, which led to renewed criticism of the company from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. Pratiti Raychoudhury said it was \u201csimply not accurate\u201d that the company\u2019s research showed Instagram was toxic for teenage girls.\nIn one example, Raychoudhury said that out of 12 areas on a slide cited by the WSJ, body image was the only issue girls said was made worse by Instagram.\n\u201cThis research, some of which relied on input from only 40 teens, was designed to inform internal conversations about teens\u2019 most negative perceptions of Instagram. It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues,\u201d Raychoudhury said.\nBeeban Kidron, a crossbench peer and member of the joint committee on the draft online safety bill that seeks to improve user safety on social media, said: \u201cIt is a victory for child rights campaigners and lawmakers around the world that Instagram Kids has been paused \u2013 but it must not be interpreted as a battle won.\n\u201cAt some point we have to ask, are Facebook simply too big to police their own products and services? Because, unless and until they can provide the service they promise they are not fit to be trusted with our kids.\u201d\nOn Monday Facebook also attempted to assuage concerns about the company\u2019s next big strategic shift, into the metaverse, or a virtual digital realm where people can lead their personal and professional lives.\nThe company announced a $50m (\u00a337m) investment programme to ensure the metaverse was built responsibly\u201d, with the money distributed among organisations and academic institutions such as Seoul National University and Women in Immersive Tech.\nSpeaking at the Atlantic festival, Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice-president of global affairs, said the metaverse would be built methodically and collaboratively between a wide range of participants.",

He pointed out that his centre-left party, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) had all picked up significant numbers of new votes at the election, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) suffered a loss in support of almost nine percentage points.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have a visible mandate that the citizens of this country have formulated,\u201d said Scholz, who is vice-chancellor in the outgoing government.\nThe Greens and the Free Democrats, who achieved 14.8% and 11.5% of the vote and could form a stronger bloc than either the SPD or CDU/CSU, have agreed to hold exploratory talks with each other before entering negotiations proper, the FDP leader, Christian Lindner, said on Monday.\nAs well as joining a power-sharing deal with the SPD, nicknamed \u201ctraffic light\u201d after the parties\u2019 traditional colours, the Greens and FDP could theoretically lend their support to a so-called \u201cJamaica coalition\u201d with the CDU, led by its chancellor candidate, Armin Laschet.\nAs exit polls on Sunday projected the SPD and CDU to be tied in a dead heat, Laschet initially sounded bullish in his determination to lead the next government, saying \u201cwe will do everything to form a government\u201d.\nBut after the SPD\u2019s lead increased as votes were counted and it went 1.6 percentage points ahead of the CDU, which also recorded its lowest-ever share of the vote, Laschet gave a more modest impression the next day, without ceding his claim completely.\nWhile the result of the vote \u201ccannot, must not and won\u2019t satisfy the [Christian Democratic] Union\u201d, the CDU leader said at a press conference, it did not yield a government mandate for either of the largest parties.\nNot only Social Democrats question Laschet\u2019s analysis of the result. On Bild newspaper\u2019s own television channel, the tabloid\u2019s commentator Paul Ronzheimer said the Rhinelander gave the impression that \u201che lives in a different reality\u201d.\nSeveral conservative politicians who had backed the CDU candidate on election night distanced themselves from his boosterish determination on Monday morning.\n\u201cSecond place cannot be construed to amount to a mandate to form the next government,\u201d tweeted Markus S\u00f6der, the Bavarian state premier whom many conservatives had wanted to see run for the top job in Laschet\u2019s stead. At a press conference, the southern German leader talked of a \u201cdisappointing result\u201d and a \u201cdefeat that cannot be sugarcoated\u201d.\n\u201cI think a lot of voters were irritated by what Laschet said on Sunday,\u201d said the political scientist Andrea R\u00f6mmele on public broadcaster ARD. \u201cI think it\u2019s dawning on them that that wasn\u2019t a particularly smart move\u201d.\nOlaf Scholz\nThe finance minister and deputy chancellor in Merkel\u2019s last government, has been an influential player in German politics since 2002, when he became the centre-left Social Democratic Party\u2019s general secretary under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.\u00a0\nA former labour lawyer and deputy leader of the SPD\u2019s then anti-capitalist Young Socialist youth wing, the taciturn 63-year-old has for most of his career been associated with the party\u2019s right: as senator for the interior and then mayor of Hamburg, he often pursued strict law and order policies and continued the mercantilist traditions of the rich port city in Germany\u2019s north.\u00a0\nIn the federal finance ministry, Scholz made sure not to shake German orthodoxies around balanced budgets. \u201cI am liberal, but I am not stupid,\u201d he once told an interviewer.\u00a0\nHis supporters say the keen jogger is not only highly competent and a stickler for detail, but also more leftwing than his reputation.\u00a0 Along with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire, he was one of the driving forces between the plan to introduced a global minimum corporate tax that was backed by the globe\u2019s leading economies this summer.\nIn Saxony, where the CDU ceded several constituencies to the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), the state premier, Michael Kretschmer, described the outcome of the vote as an \u201cearthquake\u201d that did not give his party moral authority to lead the next government.\n\u201cAt this election the CDU was not the first choice,\u201d Kretschmer told the broadcaster MDR. \u201cThere was a clear mood for change, against the CDU.\u201d\nThe Saxon leader blamed his party\u2019s poor result in the south-eastern region largely on the government handling of the Covid pandemic. Federal structures initially allowed his state to pursue its own course with social distancing rules, for example by ruling out closures of nurseries and primary schools. Later in the pandemic, state authorities were overruled by Merkel\u2019s federal government.\nScholz, the frontrunner to eventually take over Merkel\u2019s keys to the chancellory, said on Sunday evening he was confident there would be a new government by Christmas.\nBut the pace of coalition talks in the coming weeks will be unhurried and cautious, not least because the last time three German parties entered talks to share power in government, between the CDU, the Greens and the FDP in 2017, the experiment ended in failure.\nOn Monday, Scholz promised to approach talks in a very pragmatic and \u201cunboastful\u2019\u201d fashion.\nShould Scholz be able to convince the Greens and FDP to enter coalition talks with his party first and on exclusive terms, a leisurely pace may also work in his favour. The fragile truce that has persisted among Germany\u2019s conservatives so far is unlikely to survive a protracted period of watching its historical rivals inch their way to power.",

We were all mistaken as the earthquake was totally unforeseen.\u201d\nIt was too early, Lekkas said, to predict whether a stronger one would follow.\nDr Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at Imperial College London, described the tremor as the most powerful to hit the Mediterranean island since 1959.\nThe Athens Geodynamic Institute said the quake struck at 9.17am (6.17am GMT), with an epicentre 246km (153 miles) south/south-east of the Greek capital, Athens.\nHospital officials said 20 people had been treated for injuries.\nInternational and domestic flights to Heraklion airport were unaffected by the quake, while the region\u2019s hoteliers\u2019 association said there was no serious damage to any hotels in the area, which includes many popular holiday resorts.\nThere were widespread reports of holidaymakers in resorts close to Heraklion, which is particularly popular among British tourists, fleeing hotels as the quake struck.\nMunicipal construction vehicles helped clear a path for the emergency services, scooping up rubble and knocking down a badly damaged apartment block balcony.\n\u201cThis is not an event that occurred without warning,\u201d said Gerasimos Papadopoulos, a seismologist, on Greece\u2019s state broadcaster, ERT.\n\u201cWe have seen activity in this region for several months. This was a strong earthquake, it was not under sea but under land and affecting populated areas.\u201d\nThe European-Mediterranean Seismological Center and the US Geological Survey gave the quake a preliminary magnitude of 6.0, with an epicentre 7km (four miles) north of the village of Thrapsano. It is common for different seismological institutes to give varying magnitudes for an earthquake.\nGreece\u2019s climate crisis and civil protection minister, Christos Stylianides, described the situation as \u201cdramatic,\u201d saying it was impossible to forecast how long aftershocks would continue.\nA Cypriot former EU humanitarian affairs commissioner who assumed the helm of the newly created climate crisis ministry this month, Stylianides \u2013 who inspected the area after travelling to Crete \u2013 said one man had been killed.\nThe man was pulled from the rubble of a partly collapsed church in the village of Arkalochori, close to the epicentre, authorities said. Local media said the victim was a 65-year-old builder who had been working inside the church when the roof collapsed on him.\nGiannis Oikonomou, a government spokesperson, said there were no reports of people missing or trapped under rubble.\nStylianides said a state of emergency was being declared in the area. Local media said hundreds of homes had been damaged, including more than half the houses in Arkalochori.\nLekkas, who also heads Greece\u2019s Earthquake Planning and Protection Organisation, said inspections of critical buildings such as schools and hospitals had already begun.\n\u201cWe are urging people who live in damaged older buildings to remain outdoors. One aftershock can cause a collapse,\u201d Lekkas said from Crete. \u201cWe are talking about structures built before 1970. Structures built after 1985 are built to a higher standard that can withstand the effect of an earthquake.\u201d\nLocal media said hundreds of homes had been damaged, including more than half the houses in the wider area of Arkalochori.\nCivil protection officials said tents were being set up for residents whose homes had been damaged, with capacity for up to 2,500 people.\nThe fire department said it was flying 30 members of its disaster response units with search dogs and specialised rescue equipment to Crete, while all of its disaster response units and fire department services on Crete were placed on general alert.\nNumerous aftershocks have been reported in the area, with the EMSC giving a preliminary magnitude of 4.6 for the two strongest.",

Covering the Indonesian war of independence through the viewpoint of the occupier, The East is yet another pale addition to the format, rehashing empty metaphors that are barren of emotional complexity, historical poignancy or visual ingenuity.\nThe basic history is this: as the second world war draws to an end, the Netherlands sends more troops to Indonesia, hoping to regain their colonial footing as the Japanese occupation of the islands loses steam. Among these fresh-faced recruits is the angelic-looking Johan de Vries (Martijn Lakemeier); unlike the other crass soldiers, De Vries is the \u201cnice guy\u201d, whose goodness manifests in maudlin details like giving biscuits to local kids. His sense of righteousness is driven by guilt; back home, his father is imprisoned as a Nazi collaborator. Still, De Vries will soon be corrupted by an authoritarian superior whose sadism only magnifies the horrors of war.\nOstensibly a critique of imperialism, The East inadvertently commits the same sins as the old empire once did, as Indonesian characters are no more than window dressing. During the bloated running time, indigenous people appear on screen only to be violated and massacred, their screams a mere decorative sound effect. As the film clumsily pairs scenes from De Vries\u2019 life both during and after the war, he is given a degree of multidimensionality that is withheld from the Indonesian characters, who are invariably victims or barbaric aggressors. To travel all the way there only to make a tiresome Heart of Darkness pastiche is a waste.\n The East is released on 4 October on digital platforms.",

        "content": "The club needed some light and the 18-year-old\u2019s goal 323 days after suffering a knee injury provided plenty of it\nHope appeared on a Sunday afternoon, light let in at last. Just that smile would have been enough, the look of this kid stepping back on to the pitch 323 days later, taking it all in like it was the first time; the look of every kid everywhere stepping into a football stadium for the first time, overwhelmed yet inspired, at once tiny and huge.\nAnsu Fati though doesn\u2019t do enough and doesn\u2019t do waiting, so there was more. The youngest player ever to score for Barcelona and for Spain, the boy who found the net 111 seconds into his first Camp Nou start, finally headed back out there on the day he said was like a debut and by the time he came off again he had another goal.\nIt hadn\u2019t taken 10 minutes and it was impossible not to be carried along by it all. \u201cYou dream but I didn\u2019t really imagine it like this,\u201d Fati admitted. If it had been his debut, the shot from the edge of the area in the 90th minute that completed a 3-0 victory over Levante would have made him the seventh youngest goalscorer in Barcelona\u2019s history. Instead, it was his 44th and, his meniscus torn in November, he had been under the knife four times, visited doctors in three different countries, and been out of action for 11 months. A lot has changed since then, a lot loaded on to him. He is still only 18 and looks it but he came on wearing 10 and rose above it all, teammates lifting him to the sky to be seen by all and embraced by everyone. They had needed this too.\nThere is something about Ansu. Not just the talent, although there\u2019s plenty of that. Not just the moment or Barcelona\u2019s need, although there\u2019s even more of that. But something else: something in his story perhaps; something in his age, in the freshness, the excitement, maybe the simplicity too; something, certainly, in the suffering of the last year. All of which creates a connection, a rare affection that goes even beyond Barcelona, a warmth seen in the reaction that feels like it makes him everyone\u2019s and which saw his return eclipse everything on Sunday. As Levante manager Pablo L\u00f3pez said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t enjoy it much but we\u2019re happy for football that he\u2019s back.\u201d\nIt was seen even before he scored. The clock at the Camp Nou showed 79.56 when Luuk de Jong headed just over the bar, but by then a lot of the people inside the ground weren\u2019t really watching the game any more, now in a state of suspended animation. For a while attention had been drawn instead to the touchline where Fati was waiting to return. He embraced Ronald Ara\u00fajo, rubbed his face \u2013 yes, it\u2019s really happening \u2013 and on 80.21 ran on wearing a smile that was awe, a kind of childlike wonder, eyes wide and hardly able to believe he was actually here. The 35,334 fans stood and handed him an ovation and he clapped back, raised his left hand and placed his right over his heart. Then for the first time in almost a year he played.\nAnd, boy, did he play. Levante immediately had three good chances \u2013 one over, one saved, one into the side netting \u2013 as if Fati\u2019s introduction had momentarily broken Barcelona\u2019s concentration but soon he was up and running, the way he always had. \u201cDaring,\u201d Ernesto Valverde had called him and, somehow, injury hasn\u2019t changed that. \u201cI was waiting, thinking: \u2018I can enjoy it again,\u2019\u201d he said and it showed. On 83.53, his first touch, he turned Jorge Miram\u00f3n, cut inside towards the area and fired off a shot that was blocked. On 84.12, he dashed into the box and was brought down by Pablo Mart\u00ednez. The referee said no when he might have said yes, which was familiar too. The same had happened on his Camp Nou start. \u201cHave a look,\u201d Fati said. The referee didn\u2019t, but everyone else did. They couldn\u2019t take their eyes off of him.\nAnsu Fati is BACK! \ud83d\udd25The young superstar marks his return from injury after 323 days with a goal, goes to the bench to celebrate with the Barcelona staff, and then into the stand to celebrate with his brother \ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd34What a moment! \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/s11E7Bguzr\nEvery time he got the ball, there was no sign of fear, rustiness, the weight of responsibility. Instead, there was this spark, an expectation, fans getting to their feet, something about to happen. \u201cIt was like he was levitating,\u201d Marcos L\u00f3pez wrote in El Peri\u00f3dico. Morales brought him down, another run stopped at the start line, and there was a quick exchange with Memphis Depay before it happened. A turn in the middle, not quite a roulette but almost, the knee holding, the ball running his way, and Fati was off. Six touches carried him to the edge of the area, two defenders backing off and there he applied the brakes, turned to his right, stepped beyond Miram\u00f3n and struck a low shot into the net, a hint of Messi at Wembley about it.\nIt was 90.15 on 26 September 2021, and his face lit up, the gloom lifted. Relief and joy arrived together, optimism returning. Araujo opened his arms wide and Fati leapt in, the rest joining in, disbelief and happiness on their faces. Together they raised Ansu and held him high, offered to everyone, like Rafiki on the rock. The iconography was immediate, a glimpse of something good shared with the community, like he was the chosen child: here was hope, a future. The similarities between this shot and Messi after PSG didn\u2019t go unnoticed, a man \u2013 a kid \u2013 overseeing everything.\nFati planted a kiss on Araujo\u2019s forehead and, alone now, headed across to west stand, where his family were in tears. The image of Bori, his dad, fingers trying to stem the flow from his eyes said it all. Ansu climbed the stairs and made his way towards a man in a face mask, a blue polo shirt and an earpiece in: Llu\u00eds Til, the doctor. Fati reached out a hand and held him. Then came Jordi Mesalles, the physio. Above them, Fati\u2019s little brother was running down the stairs, fist ready to be bumped. \u201cAbove all, I\u2019m grateful,\u201d the striker said. \u201cI had promised my dad and my brother [I would celebrate with them] but the Covid protocol means you can\u2019t climb up [further]. They have suffered with me and I dedicate this goal to them. Going to the doctor was improvised. He and the physios have done so much for me all these months.\u201d\n\u201cThe reaction of the fans says it all: the ground exploded,\u201d insisted Alfredo Schreuder, Ronald Koeman\u2019s assistant. \u201cAnsu\u2019s an excellent player who can score a goal out of nothing. We knew that he could play 15 minutes. This is only the beginning.\u201d\nIt feels like a new beginning, and therein lies the risk. Fati was one of eight Barcelona graduates to play on Sunday, Gavi and Nico joining a new generation he is called upon to lead. Projecting him as an heir to Messi is not particularly helpful, even if when it was put to him that taking the number 10 shirt brought pressure and responsibility, he replied: \u201cEr, no. It makes me proud and grateful.\u201d The expectation will be heavy and Fati insisted that \u201cwe\u2019ve only just started and his is long\u201d, yet it is inevitable too. He represents renewal, symbolises the enthusiasm, the fun and the hope that is the whole point of sport \u2013 even if you don\u2019t get there in the end.\nSunday: Real Betis 2-0 Getafe, Rayo Vallecano 3-1 Cadiz, Real Sociedad 1-0 Elche, Barcelona 3-0 Levante, Mallorca 2-3 Osasuna\nSaturday: Real Madrid 0-0 Villarreal, Sevilla 2-0 Espanyol, Valencia 1-1 Bilbao, Alaves 1-0 Atl\u00e9tico\nMonday: Celta Vigo v Granada\nThe good news is that there is something about him too: he has an angel, the Spanish like to say. It is almost as if he doesn\u2019t notice all that pressure, is untouched by it, a purity in him just playing that carries others with him, unpolluted by the rest of it, at least for now. \u201cI\u2019ve shared my life with him, and he\u2019s special,\u201d Nico said. \u201cHe\u2019s a natural talent, he has goals and magic,\u201d Eric Garc\u00eda said.\nJust his presence felt like it changed everything, his smile all of theirs, his return their shot at revival or a restart, a kid stepping into a stadium for the first time, humbled by it but their imagination allowed to run wild. Asked if they could really stepping into a stadium for the first time, humbled by it, imagination allowed to run wild. Asked if they could really compete for the title despite Ronald Koeman imploring everyone to be \u201crealistic\u201d, Fati said: \u201cYes, of course. We\u2019re Barcelona: we\u2019re going to fight for the league and the Champions League.\u201d And for one brief moment, in that instant when the ball hit the net, emotion took everyone and anything felt possible, it didn\u2019t seem quite so silly to believe that, who knows, maybe they actually can.",

Sign up now!\nOne of those long-running feuds that goes back so long that few (least of all the warring factions so heavily invested in it) can quite remember what prompted it in the first place, Crystal Palace and Brighton resume hostilities on Monday night in what is arguably the Premier League\u2019s weirdest derby. A quick recap: having endured a somewhat pr1ckly relationship during their playing days at Tottenham, Terry Venables and Alan Mullery were appointed managers of third division clubs Palace and Brighton respectively, within a month of each other in 1976. The sides would go on to meet five times that season, tensions simmering on each occasion before reaching \u2013 quite literally \u2013 boiling point after the fourth encounter when a Palace fan threw a cup of coffee over Mullery.\nReaching into his pocket, the Brighton boss pulled out a handful of change. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re worth, Crystal Palace,\u201d he shouted, accompanying his exhortation with some V-signs. Led away by the Old Bill, he was subsequently forced to dig deep again after being fined \u00a3100 for bringing the game into disrepute. A bitter rivalry was born, albeit between two clubs located 45 miles apart and with no other obvious grounds for mutual contempt beyond an airborne cup of hot beverage and some scattered coins.\nWhile tea, coffee, Bovril and hot chocolate are all available from the Selhurst Park concession stands, in these straitened times any Crystal Palace fans thinking of scalding mild-mannered Brighton manager Graham Potter might think twice about doing so when confronted with the knowledge it will cost them \u00a32, and that\u2019s without factoring in the accompanying night in the cells, court appearance, fine and banning order. The more flash among any enraged fans are discouraged from hurling other available missiles in the form of burgers (\u00a35), hot dogs (\u00a34.50) or Tuscan bean pies (\u00a34) for the same reasons.\n\u201cI know what it means for the fans to win the game,\u201d parped Palace Pat Vieira in the buildup to the Sarf Lahndan ding-dong. \u201cI know the trouble our football club went through.

Shell Energy announced on Monday that it would take on 255,000 customers from Green, which exited the market on the same day as Avro.\nSuppliers have been rocked by surging wholesale prices for gas and electricity, which reached record highs in recent weeks as multiple factors combined to send the market soaring.\nA global surge in demand for gas after a cold winter that left gas storage facilities depleted has been exacerbated by a rebound in post-lockdown energy demand across Asia.\nHalf of the UK\u2019s electricity is generated in gas-fired power plants, while a series of nuclear reactor shortages, as well as the recent shutdown of an important power cable that brings in electricity from France, have made matters worse.\nThe UK has also had one of its least windy summers since 1961, meaning wind power has been low. Experts fear the situation will become worse as temperatures become colder.\n This article was amended on 30 September 2021. An earlier version referred to GIM as \u201cSan Francisco-based\u201d.

        "content": "Christopher Johns talks about what conditions are like for drivers in the UK and whether any solutions might be forthcoming\nChristopher Johns, 37, from Burwash, Sussex, has been an HGV driver for more than 10 years, and drives long distance in UK and Europe. Here he speaks about what conditions are like for HGV drivers in the UK, and why he feels there may be no quick solution to the current truck driver crisis.\n\u201cI\u2019m always staggered by how much truck drivers have been taken for granted in the UK. We work so hard for very little money. Our wages have desperately needed improving for such a long time. A friend\u2019s starting salary at Lidl is the same as that of many trucker friends. I could earn more if I did temp work, like many others do, but I have a wife and three kids, I need job security. I only earn enough now because I do a lot of overseas work, where you get bigger expenses allowances.\n\u201cThe difference between how truck drivers are treated in the UK and the rest of Europe is huge. We aren\u2019t catered for in the UK. There are inadequate or no facilities at all across parts of the UK, particularly in the south, to handle a driver\u2019s needs.\n\u201cWe can spend a week or two or longer away from home. This means we are forced to sleep in tiny lay-bys or industrial estate roads, with no access to basic amenities. The larger services on the big motorways are still not equipped with enough parking for large-scale vehicles, and they charge trucks around \u00a330 a night for the privilege. The rest of Europe doesn\u2019t charge for parking. France, for instance, supports HGV drivers with the Routier chain of partnership restaurants and bars \u2013 they provide showers, free parking. Getting into Europe is a relief every time.\n\u201cMy family has suffered a lot \u2013 I would say this is the same for many in the industry. My wife has been incredibly understanding with regards to my time away, which in an average month is about 20 days. I have missed so much of my kids growing up \u2013 I regret this so much.\n\u201cThe government should think about showing a lot more appreciation for those still driving before trying to find thousands of new drivers. Extending working hours for HGV drivers would be crazy \u2013 there would be horrible accidents. I also think the number of EU drivers willing to come back will be lower than some might predict. Far more emphasis needs to be placed on this job as a skilled trade, instead of just a tick on your licence.\nThe wage structure needs looking at. But first and foremost they need to make conditions better in the UK. There is no easy answer to this shortfall; this was such an obvious and predictable situation we are now in. The UK infrastructure is so far from where it needs to be. I can\u2019t see things improving overnight.\u201d",

I don\u2019t know what non-medical means, but everyone who knows Chinese government knows this isn\u2019t good.\n\u201cThe core of the policy is the same \u2013 to restrict women\u2019s reproductive means, to see women as a tool. Now there\u2019s an ageing population, a not large enough labour force, so we need more babies. It\u2019s the same: seeing women as a tool for economic goals.\u201d\nYaqiu Wang said what the government defined as non-medical reasons and how the rules would be implemented was unclear, but that the move could endanger the lives of women who were denied abortions. \u201cAround the world a lot of women die from not having safe access to abortions,\u201d she said.\nAmnesty\u2019s China researcher Kai Ong, said: \u201cThe Chinese government has a record of enforcing birth policies that blatantly violate reproductive rights, such as implementing forced birth control measures and limiting women\u2019s access to healthcare. This announcement could further restrict women\u2019s access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, especially for unmarried women and same-sex couples.\n\u201cThe proposed decrease of \u2018non-medical abortion\u2019 is one of the measures announced in the latest Outline for Women\u2019s Development in China. The legislative and policy implications of this plan are still unclear.\u201d\nIn the new guidelines set by China\u2019s state council relating to women\u2019s development, it simply listed \u201creduce non-medical abortion\u201d under the section on improving women\u2019s reproductive health. It said the measures would stop unwanted pregnancies and encourage men to \u201cshare responsibility\u201d in preventing them.\n\u201cThe basic national policy of gender equality and the principle of giving priority to children needs to be implemented in depth,\u201d said Huang Xiaowei, deputy director of the State Council\u2019s National Working Committee on Women and Children.\nChina\u2019s health authorities claimed in 2018 that abortions to end unwanted pregnancies harmed women\u2019s bodies and risked causing infertility.\nFor decades, China enforced a one-child policy to control its growing population, but it has now reversed its approach as it attempts to tackle declining birthrates, allowing a couple to have up to three children from May \u2013 \u201cto actively respond to the ageing of the population\u201d.\nFigures released this year showed that births in China fell in 2020 by almost two million, from 11.8 million to 10 million.\nYaqiu Wang said she expected there to be a reaction to the new policy, especially after the decision to introduce a three-child policy was mocked on social media after the long period of restriction.\n\u201cThey were angry because they were saying that in the past you were restricting my reproductive rights, my autonomy, now you\u2019re trying to modify your mistake while still restricting my rights,\u201d she said.",

A small quantity of drugs was also allegedly found in a farmhouse owned by Morisi.\nIn a statement shared by the League, Morisi said he had not committed any crime, but apologised to Salvini, the League, his family and colleagues for his \u201cweakness and mistakes\u201d. He said that the story represented \u201ca serious fall as a man\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a very painful moment in my life,\u201d he added. \u201cIt reveals unresolved existential fragilities to which I need to devote all the time I can in the near future.\u201d\nSalvini wrote on Facebook that Morisi could count on him as a friend. \u201cWhen a friend makes a mistake that you do not expect \u2013 and Luca has harmed himself more than others, at first you get angry, and in a big way. But then you lend him a hand to help him recover. Friendship and loyalty are everything in life.\u201d\nMorisi, 48, managed a team that carefully cultivated the image of Salvini as \u201ca man of the people\u201d, sharing posts of him savouring \u201cItalian only\u201d products, whether it be Nutella chocolate spread, tiramisu or pints of Moretti beer.\nSalvini, who was deputy prime minister and interior minister between June 2018 and August 2019, often declares war against drug dealers, even calling the government \u201cdrug dealers\u201d after parliament approved the sale of a mild version of cannabis in 2019. But most of the antagonism has been directed at immigrants, who are often demonised as drug dealers across Salvini\u2019s social media accounts. Salvini came under fire during the regional election campaign in Emilia-Romagna last year after ringing the doorbell of a Tunisian family and asking over the intercom if they dealt drugs, with the stunt being streamed live to his social media followers.\nMorisi, a former lecturer at the University of Verona, began working with the League in 2013, the year Salvini became leader. At the time, the party was polling at a meagre 3% before capturing 18% of the vote in the 2018 general elections. The League rapidly grew to become the most popular party in Italy, polling at almost 35% a year later.\nHowever, support for the party has waned, due in part to miscalculations by Salvini, including trying to collapse the government in 2019, a tactic that led to the party being pushed into opposition.\nThe League returned to government in February as part of the prime minister Mario Draghi\u2019s broad coalition. The League still had the edge in polls last week, with 20.5%. But the Democratic party is only slightly behind, while the far-right Brothers of Italy, which partners with the League in elections, is in third place with almost 19%.\nIn recent months, Salvini has fallen to eighth place in surveys of the most appreciated leaders, after Draghi, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, and the Brothers of Italy leader, Giorgia Meloni.",

        "content": "Mercedes will have to be aggressive to support Lewis Hamilton\u2019s attempt to take an eighth Formula One world championship this season, according to their team principal, Toto Wolff.\nFollowing Hamilton\u2019s victory at the Russian Grand Prix on Sunday, Wolff said the team must go on the attack against Max Verstappen and Red Bull, who finished an improbable second after starting at the rear of the grid.\nHamilton won at Sochi after an enthralling race in which he chased down the McLaren of Lando Norris who appeared to be on course to take victory. With rain late in the race, however, Norris opted to stay out and try to take the flag on slick tyres while Hamilton pitted for wet rubber. It proved to be the right decision as the rain intensified and Norris floundered, going wide and allowing Hamilton through to take the win.\nSochi is a track where Mercedes have been dominant in the past and they had expected to do well here again. With Verstappen starting from the back because of penalties imposed for taking a new engine, Mercedes had hoped to maximise their points advantage over the Dutchman. Verstappen drove a superb recovery drive, however, aided by Red Bull also pitting him early for wet tyres enabling him to sweep through from seventh to second.\nHaving been five points down, Hamilton took a two-point lead in the title fight with seven rounds remaining. However, there is little to choose between the two teams and with Mercedes having stopped developing this year\u2019s car Wolff admitted his team would have to try to take the fight to Red Bull.\n\u201cMax recovered in spectacular form, and that is not good for the championship,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to continue to be really aggressive in how we approach this season, not be defensive but just move forward, in order to score these big points.

He\u2019s with us for another couple of years at least and he will win races every year. I don\u2019t think we could predict 200 wins, but I think we could certainly predict 20 more as he\u2019s still massively competitive and motivated.\u201d",

Colleagues say one of the most significant opponents of the target, Queensland MP George Christensen, was also not on the call.\nWhile several MPs, including the party\u2019s former leader, Michael McCormack, favour pragmatism as long as the interests of regional Australians are safeguarded during the transition, some Nationals are implacably opposed to adopting a net zero target.\nAs Coalition tensions persisted, there was also a fresh round of speculation about whether or not the prime minister would attend the Glasgow conference. The government is working to a timetable of unveiling new commitments next month, ahead of Cop26.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the government was still working through who would represent Australia. \u201cIt is a significant undertaking, as you know it involves the two-week domestic quarantine as well, so no final decisions have been made.\u201d\nWith some Queensland MPs digging in their heels, Guardian Australia understands the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has floated the possibility of the government agreeing to a roadmap but not the target. Taylor is pulling together a new roadmap with input across the government intended to demonstrate how Australia could meet a net zero commitment.\nBut with senior figures, including Josh Frydenberg and the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, arguing the economic case for net zero, Liberal backbenchers insist everything has to be in the mix.\nThe member for North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman, told Guardian Australia he had \u201cconsistently argued that we need to make net zero a commitment or target for 2050\u201d.\nThat mid-century target needed to be backed by a roadmap of how to deliver the commitment, because it was \u201chard to divorce the two\u201d. \u201cYou need to demonstrate how you are going to do the hard yards but you also need to have a clear idea of where you are going,\u201d Zimmerman said.\nThe member for Higgins, Katie Allen, said the government needed to adopt the target and \u201cbring all of Australia along on that journey\u201d including people in the regions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Australia to commit to a net zero carbon 2050 target,\u201d Allen said. \u201cA commitment like that will provide historic momentum for the creation of large scale clean energy industries and jobs for the future.\u201d\nThe member for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, said he supported both \u201ca net zero target by 2050 and an updating of the 2030 roadmap\u201d.\nNationals are yet to see the roadmap. The party\u2019s deputy leader David Littleproud told reporters in Queensland on Monday \u201cthere is no decision to be made\u201d until that roadmap was presented to the Nationals.\nAfter Monday\u2019s virtual meeting, Joyce, the deputy prime minister, told the ABC Australia\u2019s coal industry faced no threat from the Morrison government.\nJoyce noted that fossil fuels were Australia\u2019s biggest export earner. \u201cMy message to the coal industry will be the coal industry continues doing the job it\u2019s been doing for our nation now for some time.\u201d\nHe said as Australia made a transition from fossil fuels \u201cto an alternate fuel source \u2013 it won\u2019t be jumping off a cliff and hoping to get a parachute on the way down\u201d.\n\u201cWe understand there may be a transition to other fuel sources and we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re part of that transition, [but] any sort of jump a cliff now will \u2026 put Australia in a financially perilous position because you lose the biggest income earner,\u201d Joyce said.",

This is just the latest of many.\nAndy McDonald\u2019s blistering assessment of Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership in his letter of resignation from the post of shadow employment rights and protections secretary.\nFrom Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s former chair:\nA constituent of mine says \u2018Marcus Rashford has done more for working people than Keir Starmer\u2019 I can\u2019t say I disagree.\nWith Labour facing an uphill battle to win the next general election, delegates in the main conference hall debated whether the party should back scrapping the first-past-the-post electoral system and moving to a form of proportional representation instead. The motion said the current system \u201cprivileges \u2018swing voters\u2019 over neglected voters \u2013 including younger, black and minority ethnic communities\u201d, creating \u201cwidespread disenfranchisement, disillusion and disengagement in politics\u201d.\nBut Margaret Clarke, of the GMB union, who spoke against the proposal, said it would be an unnecessary distraction and had been proven to be unpopular with voters, having been rejected in a referendum in 2011.\nSome Labour figures feared the conference had already been overshadowed by internal wrangling over party rule changes and Angela Rayner calling Tory ministers \u201cscum\u201d. However, their frustrations reached new heights after Andy McDonald announced he was quitting the shadow cabinet.\nMcDonald said it was because Starmer\u2019s office had instructed him to argue against a national minimum wage of \u00a315 and against statutory sick pay being raised to the living wage, which he refused to do. He said it was important to raise awareness of the true value of the work done by low-paid workers. \u201cTo have the Labour party \u2013 the party of working people \u2013 fail to realise that is a bitter blow,\u201d he said.\nMcDonald was one of the few remaining shadow cabinet ministers who served under Jeremy Corbyn, and some centrists will not mourn his departure. Charlie Falconer, the shadow attorney general, told the Guardian the timing of the move was \u201cundermining\u201d and clearly \u201cproblematic\u201d for Starmer.\nLabour will try to steer attention back to its policies by devoting Tuesday to the issue of public services. The centrepiece will be the shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds\u2019 speech on neighbourhood policing, with further addresses to the conference hall from the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth; the shadow education secretary, Kate Green; the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy; and the shadow child poverty secretary, Wes Streeting.",

        "content": "Predictions billpayers will be left counting a high cost for failure of energy suppliers seem to add up\n\nThe warning last week from Keith Anderson, Scottish Power\u2019s chief executive, that \u201cbillions\u201d could be added to household bills from the failure of energy suppliers was dramatic, but his arithmetic adds up. One sees how the sum may have reached \u00a31bn already.\nA precise tally is impossible because the \u201clast resort\u201d suppliers picking up stranded customers haven\u2019t yet made claims under the system that allows them to recoup the costs of transfer via an industry-wide levy that is ultimately put on bills. But roughly 1.5 million customers have been switched since early August, now that Shell Energy has taken on Green\u2019s 255,000 customers and Octopus Energy has taken charge of Avro\u2019s 580,000. With wholesale gas prices so high, new suppliers\u2019 claims will be far higher than in the past. A figure of \u00a3500 a customer, or more, seems possible.\nAt \u00a3500-a-head for 1.5 million customers, the levy charge would be \u00a3750m. Then one must add the cost of possible defaults by failed companies on their renewable obligations and feed-in tariffs, the two main schemes for channelling incentives to generators of clean energy. Any shortfalls, once they reach a certain level, are also \u201cmutualised\u201d, in regulatory-speak.\nThe \u201csupplier of last resort\u201d mechanism has worked so far in the sense that companies have volunteered to take on extra customers. So one can understand why the government and Ofgem are keen to stick to what they know: the alternative is the untested \u201cspecial administration regime\u201d, which would mean the state accepted the messy job of buying energy for affected customers.\nBut, at \u00a31bn-ish and counting, the exercise threatens to create a serious political headache next year when the extra charges are incorporated into the price cap from October 2022. If the sum were to reach \u00a33bn, which is not impossible if larger suppliers fail, it would eliminate a chunk of the gains from the eventual (we hope) return to \u201cnormal\u201d wholesale prices.\nGood luck to ministers in selling that message. It would be saying, in effect, that energy bills rise sharply when wholesale prices surge, but the same doesn\u2019t apply in reverse because of the delayed costs of the current mop-up operation. The government could try blaming Ofgem, which would be fair up to a point: the regulator has been shockingly lax in policing small suppliers\u2019 capital buffers and hedging arrangements. But, in the end, anguish over energy bills always lands at the government\u2019s door.\nThe price cap rises by \u00a3139 at the end of this week, with another \u00a3200-ish semi-guaranteed next April under the backwards-looking formula for calculating wholesale prices. Then the cost of the current mess will kick in. There is a serious long-term problem here for government, and it is not obvious it has grasped the size of it.\nSuddenly everything is going right for Rolls-Royce. A \u20ac1.7bn deal to sell ITP Aero, the Spanish aircraft engine business, to a private equity-led buyer has been agreed, putting the target to raise \u00a32bn from disposals in sight.\nMeanwhile, the US has reopened hassle-free flying between Europe and the US for vaccinated passengers. Since about a fifth of Rolls\u2019 revenues from \u201cengine flying hours\u201d service contracts relate to transatlantic routes, there should be a quick boost to cashflows.\nTo complete the flurry of better news, the company has won the contract in the US to supply engines to upgraded B-52 bombers. That is a notable win away from home: General Electric was the financial bookies\u2019 favourite to land a contract that could eventually be worth $2.6bn.\nRolls\u2019 shares rose 11%. Given the low starting point, that may not be enough to silence US activist agitator Causeway Capital, calling vaguely for a board \u201crefresh\u201d. But it\u2019s definitely a start.\nGrant Thornton came clean on its Patisserie Valerie audit shambles and thus got its \u00a34m fine from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) reduced to \u00a32.3m. Read the watchdog\u2019s full report, though, and one can see why fighting this case was never an option.\nTry this example of a \u201cred flag\u201d that the auditor missed: 73% of the chain\u2019s annual income from vouchers from a third party was received on a single day in 2016 just before the financial year-end. Or this: Grant Thornton learned from banks that the company had reactivated and used at least one dormant account, but it never challenged management on why it hadn\u2019t mentioned the fact.\nThe FRC described \u201ca serious lack of competence\u201d in the audit, but it was putting things mildly. Patisserie Valerie was a chain of cake shops. It was not a complicated business.",

The administration had hoped recommending and implementing booster shots would be a simple matter.\n\u201cLet me be clear, boosters are important,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cThe most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 We need to get folks vaccinated. Please, please do the right thing. Please get the shot. It can save your life and the lives of those around you.\u201d\nTwo panels of independent experts, under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have carved out categories of Americans eligible to receive a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine.\nBut both agencies approved boosters for far fewer Americans than Biden had hoped.\nPeople who have received two shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines remain well protected against hospitalization and death. Booster shots may limit transmission, but it is unclear to what extent.\nBoosters are not expected to significantly change the trajectory of the pandemic. Only getting more new people vaccinated is likely to significantly alter rates of hospitalizations and deaths.\nIn August, Biden told Americans the general public would be eligible for booster shots of both two-shot vaccines by 20 September. In a high-profile address he said, \u201cJust remember, as a simple rule: eight months after your second shot, get a booster shot.\u201d\nHowever, rules around boosters have proved far from simple. While leaders at the FDA and CDC agreed with Biden\u2019s plan, the independent panels which help guide decision-making at each agency had not looked at the data. When they did, experts significantly winnowed down who they believed should be eligible for a third dose.\nThe FDA approved booster doses for recipients of the Pfizer vaccine six months after their second dose, but only for those aged 65 years and older or those between 18 and 65 who had a high chance of developing severe Covid-19 or being exposed at work.\nThe CDC said who \u201cshould\u201d and who \u201cmay\u201d get a booster shot. According to that guidance, people older than 65, aged 50 to 64 with underlying health conditions or between 18 and 65 and in long-term care \u201cshould\u201d receive a booster.\nYounger people who risk exposure at work and have underlying health conditions \u201cmay\u201d get a booster.\nPeople with compromised immune systems should receive a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA and CDC recommended a third dose for this group with relatively little fanfare.\nThe FDA and CDC are expected to separately review the evidence for a booster dose of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots.\nAs Biden received his third dose, he implied eligibility may expand in the future.\n\u201cLast week they laid out who is eligible for those boosters for now,\u201d he said.\nBiden reminded reporters he was eligible to receive a third dose because he is 78. He also said the first lady, Jill Biden, would get a booster dose. She is 70.\n\u201cThe most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated,\u201d said Biden, giving out a number so Americans can locate nearby distributors.\n\u201cOver 77% of adults have gotten at least one shot,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 22% haven\u2019t gotten any shots, and that distinct minority is causing an awful lot of damage for the rest of the county.\u201d\nBiden said he would travel to Chicago on Wednesday to push more employers to mandate vaccines for staff.\nAfter a nurse administered the shot, Biden rolled down his sleeve and buttoned his cuff then walked to the dais for questions.\n\u201cI\u2019m a born optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cI think things are going to go well, and we\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d",

But the votes from affiliates \u2013 almost entirely comprising unions \u2013 were 95% opposed. The eventual result was nearly 58% against.\nLaura Parker from Labour for a New Democracy, which backed the motion, said the vote showed that party members were overwhelmingly in support of proportional representation, and that Keir Starmer should have shown more support for the idea.\nShe said: \u201cRank-and-file trade unionists play a key role in our campaign, but despite this most unions do not yet back reform. The truth is, if the leadership had engaged with this unifying policy as intensively as they pushed their own proposed rule changes, PR would now be Labour policy.\u201d\nEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, called the result \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. He said: \u201cWe can only build a better politics and a fairer country with a fairer electoral system. We will keep working with the many in the Labour party and across all parties who want to see a fairer electoral system.\u201d\nDuring a debate on the main conference stage, a series of local delegates backed the motion, with one saying first past the post was creating a generation of apathetic young people.\n\u201cI see so few of my friends, of my generation, engaged in political activity, even if they\u2019re passionate about the issues. So many never show up to vote,\u201d one said. \u201cWe need to ensure that every voter, not just those in swing seats, feels heard.\u201d\nThe only speaker against the idea was Margaret Clarke, of the GMB union, who called the motion an \u201cattempt to commit the Labour party to an unnecessary distraction in backing proportional representation\u201d.\nShe said of PR: \u201cIt\u2019s unpopular. Voters rejected it overwhelmingly in a referendum in 2011. It\u2019s less accountable, breaking the vital constituency links between hundreds of Labour MPs and their voters across the UK. It also risks handing power to the far right in our parliament.\u201d\nBut other speakers pointed out that the 2011 referendum on a change to the voting system, run as part of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 requirements to join a coalition with the Conservatives, was about the alternative vote system, which is not proportional.\nThe motion argued that first past the post created \u201celectoral deserts\u201d and \u201cwidespread disenfranchisement, disillusion and disengagement in politics\u201d.\nIt said: \u201cA voting system in which every vote counts equally is needed to address the worrying levels of alienation, division and mistrust in British politics. Labour in government played a leading role in introducing forms of PR to the UK\u2019s devolved government.\n\u201cThere are systems of PR that retain a strong constituency link between MPs and their electorates, while ensuring that all votes count equally and seats match votes.\u201d",

But this year there was an extra strand to the dance-based psychodrama: a national debate over whether an individual has the right to keep their vaccination status private.\nWhile millions of people tuned in for the first episode, the BBC was busy dealing with claims that some of the show\u2019s professional dancers have not had a Covid-19 vaccine, potentially putting others on the close-contact programme at risk.\nWith all British adults having been offered a jab, the issue has highlighted the difficulty in UK law of balancing the right of an individual to keep their medical information private with the right of colleagues to make informed decisions about the risk of catching Covid-19.\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost no legitimate reason for publishing [an individual\u2019s vaccine status] to the world at large,\u201d said Mark Stephens, data privacy lawyer at law firm Howard Kennedy. \u201cBut there may be circumstances \u2013 such as on Strictly \u2013 to amplify that information to allow people working closely with that individual to know what risk they are about to embark on.\u201d\nThe BBC has not required participants on the show to be vaccinated, with the Sun claiming that at least three professional dancers have not had a Covid-19 vaccine. While some people are unable to have the vaccine for medical reasons, the tabloid suggested that the dancers on the show would rather quit than be forced to have a jab.\nA report in the Times also claimed that the Mail on Sunday had attempted to name some of the dancers who declined to be vaccinated, only to meet a strong pushback from their lawyers. Similar issues have been faced by people competing in team sports, with many professional footballers not having a jab.\nHowever, the public is unlikely to find out which celebrities have turned down a vaccine. Stephens said privacy law in the UK makes it almost impossible to justify publishing private medical information, even if it is known by an individual\u2019s colleagues: \u201cIf you are a person who is informed of someone\u2019s vaccine status, you come into a ring of confidence. You don\u2019t have a right to tell anyone else, it\u2019s for the purpose of you making your informed decision as to whether you wish to take a risk.\u201d\nA handful of Strictly dancers, including Giovanni Pernice, Oti Mabuse and Amy Dowden, have publicly confirmed they are vaccinated. Unluckily, Dowden then missed the first episode of the show after she and partner Tom Fletcher caught Covid.\nThe BBC has insisted it has strict testing regimes in place on Strictly Come Dancing and would not discuss individual cases: \u201cThe BBC has never commented nor confirmed the vaccination status of anyone on the show. It\u2019s not our place to.\n\u201cIt is not the case that concerns have been raised with the BBC or the Strictly production team from dancers or celebrities about vaccination, or that they have threatened to quit.\u201d",

She told the Liverpool Echo that she spotted the deer fleeing a police officer on her way into work.\n\u201cIt must have been quite scared and I genuinely have no idea where it was from,\u201d she said.\nPolice said they later secured it inside an industrial estate, where it was assessed by a vet who monitored its welfare and attempted to help the armed response officers to control it. A spokesperson for Merseyside police said they were unable to find assistance to safely recover the deer \u2013 despite making \u201cseveral inquiries\u201d \u2013 and \u201cas the hours went by the deer became more distressed\u201d.\nThe RSPCA said that it advised officers to leave the deer to make its own way home, explaining that deer sightings in urban areas are becoming increasingly common.\n pic.twitter.com/q0DiaJzcQ8\nBut the police said that there was \u201cno option to let the deer wander as it could be a danger to motorists and members of the public in the area\u201d, particularly as the hours of darkness approached.\n\u201cAs a result a decision was made in the early evening to euthanise the deer,\u201d Merseyside police said in a statement.\nThe RSPCA said that where public safety is a consideration, it is a decision for the police. One option could have been to sedate the animal, and move it to a safer place to be released, but that would have taken some caution in a public area to avoid the deer being startled and running when hit by the anaesthetic dart. \u201cThis could create a bigger public safety and animal welfare issue,\u201d the animal welfare organisation added.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough deer traditionally live in forests, moors and parkland, they are becoming more common in urban environments across the UK. We do see deer in city centres \u2013 they usually live in large park areas but will follow canal paths and tramlines to make their way in and out of the cities.\u201d\nVideos and photos appeared on social media showing the white deer, going through a park and then on an industrial estate.\nIn 2019, a deer was spotted in Manchester city centre, running through the busy Oxford Road area and swimming in the canal. An RSPCA spokesperson at the time said it managed to get free and run away from officers.\n This article was amended on 4 October 2021. An earlier version described the deer in the text and headline as a \u201crare white stag\u201d. Fallow deer are unusual, though not rare, and males are traditionally called bucks, not stags.",

        "content": "Andy McDonald says Labour \u2018more divided than ever\u2019 hours after party unveils key spending pledge\nKeir Starmer\u2019s shadow employment secretary was accused of sabotage on Monday night after he quit in protest at the Labour leadership in a move that colleagues said was designed to overshadow a \u00a328bn green spending pledge.\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled one of the party\u2019s key policies of its annual conference earlier in the day, saying a Labour government would invest \u00a3244bn over eight years in tackling the climate crisis.\nBut within hours Andy McDonald resigned over Labour\u2019s failure to support a \u00a315-an-hour minimum wage and said the party was \u201cmore divided than ever\u201d. The Guardian understands Labour activists opposed to Starmer are intending to capitalise on the resignation with a protest to demand the living wage rise during his speech on Wednesday.\nMcDonald had worked closely with the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, on the party\u2019s offer on workers rights but it is understood she and Starmer were blindsided by the resignation.\nA senior Labour official said: \u201cThis is clearly a pathetic orchestrated attempt to undermine the changes happening in the party. We won\u2019t be losing any sleep over this attempt at sabotaging Labour conference.\u201d\n\u200bMcDonald denied that the resignation was orchestrated or political, and told the BBC he had resigned as a point of principle.\u200b\nIn his resignation letter, McDonald said his role had become untenable and added: \u201cAfter 18 months of your leadership our movement is more divided than ever and the pledges you made to the membership are not being honoured.\u201d He said he had been \u201cinstructed to go into a meeting and argue against a national minimum wage of \u00a315 an hour and against statutory sick pay at the living wage. This is something I could not do.\u201d\nMcDonald launched a green paper on workers\u2019 rights with Rayner last week, which included a \u00a310 minimum wage proposal. A shadow cabinet source said: \u201cIf we are to take his argument at face value, it appears he\u2019s resigned on the basis of a policy he agreed and announced at the weekend.\u201d\nRelations between Starmer and McDonald had been on shaky ground. The Guardian understands the Labour leader intended to sack McDonald in the reshuffle in the spring but reversed the decision after a row over Rayner\u2019s role, giving her the \u201cfuture of work\u201d brief to which McDonald contributed.\nIn a short response on Monday, Starmer thanked McDonald and pointedly referred to his own work on employment rights. \u201cLabour\u2019s comprehensive new deal for working people shows the scale of our ambition and where our priorities lie,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus and that of the whole party is on winning the next general election so we can deliver for working people who need a Labour government.\u201d\nSeveral shadow cabinet ministers expressed anger at links with the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, whose ex-media adviser Andy Whittaker helped coordinate the announcement of McDonald\u2019s departure.\nConcern had also been raised internally about an event at the Momentum fringe festival where McDonald had been due to speak with the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who currently has the Labour whip suspended.\nA shadow cabinet source compared McDonald\u2019s departure disparagingly to the return of the former MP Louise Ellman, who quit the party over antisemitism in 2019. On Monday she said she had returned as she was \u201cconfident that under the leadership of Keir Starmer the party is once again led by a man of principle in whom the British people and Britain\u2019s Jews can have trust\u201d.\nCharlie Falconer, the shadow attorney general, suggested McDonald\u2019s departure may have been deliberately timed to distract from \u201cthe message that Rachel Reeves is giving the country\u201d. He told Sky News: \u201cHe leaves on a day when the party has chosen a particular direction \u2026 this conference made it clear what they wanted with the reception they gave Rachel Reeves this morning.\u201d\nSteve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, said: \u201cWe all of us need to be disciplined enough to focus on the things that matter to the people of this country ... The party is rallying round Keir in a way I\u2019ve never seen in a very, very long time.\u201d\nReeves was caught off guard in a fringe meeting as the departure was announced. However, key leftwing figures said the resignation was an indictment of the leadership. In the conference hall, members cheered as one heckler shouted \u201csolidarity with Andy McDonald\u201d.\nLen McCluskey, the former Unite general secretary, called McDonald \u201ca really decent man\u201d and said: \u201cHe makes the point that Keir was elected on a radical platform and yet he has abandoned that radical platform and the party is moving more and more away from it.\u201d\nMish Rahman, a Momentum member of the Labour NEC, said: \u201cLabour has to be the party of working people not bosses. During the leadership election it seemed like Starmer understood this, but this resignation proves he does not.\u201d\nRichard Burgon, the former shadow cabinet minister, said McDonald had \u201cput up with an awful lot to drive through a superb programme of workers\u2019 rights \u2026 To instruct him to drop his principles on wages and sick pay was a huge misjudgment of Andy and the movement.\u201d",

        "content": "Olaf Scholz, poised to become next chancellor, wades into row over HGV driver shortage\nThe centre-left politician in pole position to replace Angela Merkel as German chancellor has pinpointed the decision to end freedom of movement with Europe after Brexit as the reason for Britain\u2019s petrol crisis.\nOlaf Scholz, who is seeking to form a coalition government after the SPD emerged as the biggest party in Germany\u2019s federal elections, said he hoped Boris Johnson would be able to deal with the consequences of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\u201cThe free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we worked very hard to convince the British not to leave the union,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNow they decided different, and I hope that they will manage the problems coming from that, because I think it is constantly an important idea for all of us to make it happen that there will be good relations between the EU and the UK, but this is a problem to be solved.\u201d\nA number of EU member states, including Germany, have longstanding HGV driver shortages. The most heavily affected countries are Poland (a shortage of 124,000 drivers) and Germany (45,000 to 60,000). But unlike in the UK, companies in the EU have been able to rely on nationals from their neighbours to fill the gaps, and the problems of empty supermarket shelves and panic-buying at petrol station forecourts have been avoided.\nOn Monday pump prices for fuel in the UK hit an eight-year high as forecourts ran dry, Downing Street faced demands to give ambulance drivers, healthcare staff and other essential workers priority access to fuel, and there were calls for calm as UK fuel suppliers said they expected demand to return to normal \u201cin the coming days\u201d.\nThe army is being put on standby to help but ministers decided against immediately deploying troops to drive lorries.\nIt emerged on Monday night that the NHS was being forced to postpone appointments for cancer patients and other people with serious conditions as a result of the fuel crisis.\nSeveral cancer patients due to attend appointments this week at University College hospital, one of London\u2019s largest hospitals, have been told they will have to be rescheduled, the Guardian has learned.\nA UCLH spokesperson confirmed that a \u201csmall number\u201d of patients were having appointments rearranged, but insisted that no patients requiring urgent treatment would have their treatment delayed.\nThe fuel crisis has sparked a debate over whether and to what degree Brexit is to blame. Last week Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said Europe\u2019s driver shortage was equal to or worse than Britain\u2019s, and claimed leaving the EU had helped \u201cprovide a solution\u201d.\nBut Anna Soubry, a former Tory business minister who quit the party over Brexit, said Scholz was right and added: \u201cIt\u2019s like something happened to our country and no one is allowed to speak truth to the power of Boris Johnson and his Brexit.\u201d\nShe said: \u201cWe are now facing up to the reality of Brexit. We have got shortages. We are going to have inflation and we are not going to be the country we were before we took this decision. Saying this stuff isn\u2019t criticising the people who voted for it.\n\u201cThe criticism is levelled at the leaders of the leave campaign \u2026 who went out and told lies to the British people and who promised sunlit uplands.\u201d\nThe shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, blamed a bad Brexit deal and said Labour should make this clear to the public. \u201cThis is their [the government\u2019s] deal: this is the consequences,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe exited the customs union \u2026 hauliers now pay tariffs to come into the country \u2026 the incentives to be here aren\u2019t there in the same way.\u201d\nA report from Transport Intelligence, a research company specialising in the logistics industry, described the UK as entering a \u201cBermuda triangle of Brexit, pandemic and tax reforms/peak seasons, leading to a pressing driver shortage in the UK\u201d.\nScholz echoed Johnson\u2019s own explanation for the shortage of drivers in some European countries. He said: \u201cLet me just add it might have to do something with the question of wages \u2026 They want to know if it\u2019s something very good for their whole life and if you understand that being a trucker is something which many people really like it to be, and you find not enough [people], this has something to do with working conditions and this has to be thought about.\u201d\nThe accumulation of problems in the UK in recent weeks \u2013 from empty supermarket shelves, gas shortages, a lack of petrol on forecourts and the short supply of CO2 required for services ranging from the running of abattoirs to the production of fizzy drinks \u2013 has been seized upon in the European media as being part of the Brexit fallout.\nLib\u00e9ration, a French newspaper, ran a front page with an empty toilet paper roll bearing the words: \u201cBrexit: Les lendemains qui d\u00e9chantent\u201d (The tomorrows that failed to deliver).\n\u00c0 la une de Lib\u00e9ration ce vendredi : \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Brexit : les lendemains qui d\u00e9chantent\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/nj2k4myNIH pic.twitter.com/4WBRYJ7wdl\nAccording to Transport Intelligence, Brexit made it \u201clegally impossible to recruit foreign HGV drivers\u201d, while the Covid pandemic created a backlog of tests and led to about 15,000 eastern European drivers returning home, many of them for good.\nThe number of EU nationals driving HGVs in the UK rose from 10,000 to 45,000 between 2010 and 2017, and fell to 42,000 in early 2020. From March to June 2020 the number of EU HGV drivers declined to 25,000, recovering only slightly to 28,000 by the end of the year.\nThe government has introduced tax changes that Transport Intelligence said had exacerbated the exodus from the UK by obliging all contractors with a turnover of \u00a310m or 50 staff to pay full tax and national insurance on their drivers, starting in April 2021.\nMichael Clover, the head of commercial development at Transport Intelligence, said: \u201cIt is a perfect storm really. We don\u2019t have the lever of other international drivers to come in like most of Europe so capacity can be shuffled around, because we are no longer in the EU. Poland has for a long time been a net exporter of drivers but you can fill some of those gaps with drivers from Lithuania or Hungary or from Romania, Bulgaria and a few other EU states.\u201d",

        "content": "In the immediate aftermath of a record defeat by the United States, Europe\u2019s players were probably delighted there are two years to run before another Ryder Cup. The flip side is that is a short period to implement a changing of the guard. Steve Stricker\u2019s team, which mauled Europe 19-9, had an average age of 26. Europe, at 35, looked geriatric in comparison.\nThe unwritten rule of Europe and Ryder Cups tells us P\u00e1draig Harrington will bow out after a single captaincy stint. Lee Westwood is the overwhelming favourite to lead Europe in Rome in 2023, which would render his singles win over Harris English his last playing act in this event. Westwood, now 48, remains circumspect over what his future holds.\n\u201cI assume I\u2019ll get three or four months to think about it but people keep coming up and saying, \u2018Are you going to be the captain in Rome?\u2019 I\u2019d prefer to play but Father Time\u2019s not kind, is he?\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s better playing than it is watching.\n\u201cBeing Ryder Cup captain is a massive honour and it is something I\u2019d want to do. Why wouldn\u2019t you? I\u2019m sure P\u00e1draig\u2019s enjoyed it even though it\u2019s not gone right for him. It\u2019s got to be some time in my future but I don\u2019t want to let go yet. I still feel competitive.\u201d\nIn the cold light of day it has to be assumed captaincy will make far more sense to Westwood than attempting to qualify. The Englishman is also smart enough to consider likely outcomes. The weekend showed Europe need younger talent \u2013 akin to the outstanding Norwegian Viktor Hovland \u2013 to supplement Jon Rahm, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry. The top two players on the European Tour\u2019s order of merit are American.\n\u201cThe US have had theirs,\u201d said Ian Poulter of personnel overhauls, pointing out that Tiger Woods was absent while Phil Mickelson was present only as a vice-captain. \u201cYou know they\u2019ve handed the baton over,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the team room on Saturday there were a couple of emotional speakers and you just wish you were 20 years old again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard, when you\u2019ve played so many [and been] part of so many successful teams; hard when you get old and you know so many of the best days are behind you.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a super crop of young players. Our younger players can grow over the next few years like the Americans have.\u201d\nPoulter rightly referenced the H\u00f8jgaard twins, Nicolai and Rasmus, who, at 20 years old, are already European Tour winners. Predicting future Ryder Cup teams is a fool\u2019s errand \u2013 just ask Matteo Manassero \u2013 but this pair look destined for the top. The Italian Guido Migliozzi, who tied fourth in the US Open, continues to nudge his way towards the world\u2019s top 50. Robert MacIntyre\u2019s major performances have been notable.\n\u201cThe future\u2019s bright for European golfers,\u201d said Westwood. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say Jon Rahm is world-class because he\u2019s world No 1 but watching him and Sergio is like watching Seve and Olly.\n\u201cIt keeps flip-flopping, doesn\u2019t it? We set the course up for us, narrow the fairways, have thick rough. They set it up for them, they cut all the rough out and home advantage is massive. It was even bigger this time with no crowds [backing Europe].\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect much support but, other than a handful, there was zero this week. Not that that\u2019s an excuse. We were just outplayed and out-putted.\u201d\nIf Westwood does assume captaincy duties, there will be no repeat of the messy conclusion to the qualifying campaign that overshadowed the PGA Championship at Wentworth. Westwood would also rather increase wildcard picks from three to four. \u201cBut that\u2019s the nice thing, different captains have different ideas,\u201d he said.\nWestwood and Poulter afforded high praise to Harrington. \u201cPaddy has done incredible this week,\u201d said Poulter. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t read the papers on Tuesday and see stuff that will upset me.\n\u201cPaddy and [his wife] Caroline gave their heart and soul for three years. They made us all feel so comfortable. You just have to take your hat off to the American team.\u201d\nAnd work out how to stop them.",

        "content": "For the Brighton supporters who remained here long after the final whistle, this was a night they will surely never forget. Trailing as the clock ticked into the fifth minute of injury time to Wilfried Zaha\u2019s fifth goal in his last five matches against Crystal Palace\u2019s bitter rivals, Neal Maupay\u2019s deft finish with the last kick of the game somehow rescued a point for Graham Potter\u2019s side.\nIt was not quite what they had deserved on an evening that Zaha celebrated his 400th appearance for Palace by scoring from the spot just before half- time but, despite missing the opportunity to scale the Premier League\u2019s summit, Brighton will not care in the slightest.\nA dominant performance from Patrick Vieira\u2019s side until then had seemed enough to earn the points but after Jordan Ayew spurned a golden chance to make it 2-0, there was a sense of inevitability about what happened next.\nVicente Guaita seemed to have done enough to run down the clock after being awarded a free-kick with less than 60 seconds remaining yet the Palace goalkeeper\u2019s punt was volleyed straight back by Jo\u00ebl Veltman to allow Maupay to apply his lobbed finish. Zaha and Maupay then clashed as tempers flared at the final whistle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling for us,\u201d said Potter. \u201cIt\u2019s not the easiest place to be perfect and we weren\u2019t but I felt we deserved something from the game. The resilience among the players is fantastic.\u201d\nWhile Brighton were aiming to go top of the table for the first time in their history, it was almost exactly 42 years to the day since Palace achieved the same feat under Terry Venables.\nThe clashes between sides led by the former England manager and his Brighton counterpart Alan Mullery in the late 1970s and early 1980s have given this unlikely derby a feisty edge ever since and the police presence in the streets around Selhurst Park was an indication of the antipathy that still lingers strongly.\nThe absence of the influential midfielder Yves Bissouma due to a knee injury forced Potter into a switch of formation while Vieira handed Odsonne \u00c9douard his first start in place of Christian Benteke after the new striker\u2019s heroics here against Tottenham earlier this month.\nAfter a huge reception from the home fans for Zaha, Palace began positively but they found Brighton\u2019s five-man defence difficult to break down and had only a blocked effort from Conor Gallagher to show for their dominance during the opening 15 minutes.\nHaving made 14 of those 400 appearances against Brighton, Zaha had been urged by Vieira to use his experience of this intense occasion to help guide his younger teammates. However, a lapse from Tyrick Mitchell almost allowed Leandro Trossard to open the scoring just after the half-hour mark before Danny Welbeck wasted a great chance after being played in by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s punt forward.\nReplays suggested Welbeck may have been impeded as he attempted to lift the ball over Guaita but no penalty was given. But Palace\u2019s endeavour eventually paid off on the stroke of half-time after a period of concerted pressure.\nTrossard\u2019s foul on Gallagher left the referee, Andre Marriner, with no choice but to point to the spot and Zaha slammed the penalty past S\u00e1nchez before cupping his ears as he celebrated in front of the Brighton fans in the away end.\nPotter responded by switching to a back four in an attempt to limit Palace\u2019s superiority in midfield. It seemed to have an immediate effect as Lewis Dunk forced Guaita into a save from a Marc Cucurella free-kick.\nThe arrival of Benteke with 20 minutes to play was a sure sign that Vieira sensed an opportunity to pile pressure on Brighton\u2019s defence as they went looking for an equaliser.\nThe chance duly came with 14 minutes left when Gallagher\u2019s interception allowed Benteke to set up Jordan Ayew, only for him to drag his effort wide with the goal gaping and stretch his barren run to 35 games.\n\u201cJordan missing that chance was important but it is down to a lack of confidence and it is my responsibility to bring him back to what we know he can do,\u201d said Vieira.\nThe true cost of his miss was revealed when Maupay pounced on Guaita\u2019s error to deny the Palace manager a famous victory and leave Potter feeling mightily relieved.",

The Coalition also enjoys a five-point lead on management of international relations.\nWhile the new Aukus submarine pact was clearly a response to China\u2019s increasing militarisation in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 a trend that destabilises the region and imperils US interests \u2013 the latest poll suggests most Australians do not favour confrontation with Beijing.\nA majority of respondents (66%) characterised China as a \u201ccomplex relationship to be managed\u201d. Around a quarter (24%) characterised China as \u201ca threat to be confronted\u201d and 10% said Australia\u2019s relationship with China is a \u201cpositive opportunity to be realised\u201d.\nWhen asked about the impact of the nuclear submarine deal on domestic security, 45% said the partnership would make Australia more secure, while 55% of respondents either said the arrangement will make no difference or it will make Australia less secure.\nOn voter trust to manage climate change, Labor has a 13-point lead over the Coalition.\nWhile Morrison was in the US last week meeting Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, and engaging in defence talks with the Quad \u2013 which is an informal grouping of the US, Australia, India and Japan \u2013 divisions erupted within the Coalition about whether the government should adopt a net zero emissions reduction target by 2050.\nThe prime minister wants to unveil new climate commitments before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow.\nWith the debate about net zero expected to span the next few weeks, the latest poll shows a majority of Australians would support government intervention to expand renewable energy (66%), with only 8% supporting coal or gas plants.\nWith the new submarine pact sparking a renewed conversation about whether or not Australia needs a domestic nuclear power industry, 19% of respondents would also favour government support for nuclear power plants.\nWhen respondents were asked to what extent they would support or oppose using nuclear energy sources, 47% supported nuclear powered submarines (21% opposed) and 48% supported nuclear power (24% opposed), while 29% said they would support nuclear weapons (38% opposed).\nVoters were also asked about their attitudes to the management of the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe latest poll indicates the Berejiklian government has recovered some of its lost standing with voters. Approval in the last survey stood at 46% (down from a high of 75% in March), but in the latest data, with the premier signalling the end of lockdown is close for vaccinated residents, 53% of respondents approved.\nIn Victoria, as Delta cases continues to climb, sentiment has gone in the other direction. In the last survey, 50% approved of Daniel Andrews\u2019 management of the pandemic, but that has dropped six points in a fortnight to 44%.\nThe prime minister\u2019s metrics were steady, with 45% saying the federal government\u2019s management of the pandemic was good, and 30% saying poor.\nVoters were also asked about the roadmaps for reopening in the two states once vaccination thresholds reach 70-80% of adults. In NSW, 48% of respondents said they understood Berejiklian\u2019s plan and had confidence in it, while 40% lacked confidence in it. In Victoria, 36% said they understood the Andrews plan and had confidence in it, while 50% lacked confidence in it.\nWith Covid vaccination rates continuing to climb around the country, particularly in the lockdown states and the Australian Capital Territory, the number of respondents in the Guardian Essential survey declaring they will never be vaccinated is down to 7%. But that figure is significantly higher among voters planning to support someone other than the major parties.",

What we\u2019ve shown is that if those of normal weight lose 10 to 15% of their weight, they have a very good chance of getting rid of their diabetes.\u201d\nThe participants, who had an average BMI of 24.5, followed a weight-loss programme that included a low-calorie liquid diet for two weeks \u2013 where each day they were consuming only 800 calories a day through soups and shakes.\nThey completed three rounds of this programme until they lost 10 to 15% of their body weight.\nAfter weight loss was achieved, scans showed reductions in the fat in the liver and eight of the 12 participants had their type 2 diabetes go into remission, which was defined as having blood sugar levels under control and patients no longer needing any medication.\nTaylor said the results, while preliminary, \u201cdemonstrate very clearly that diabetes is not caused by obesity but by being too heavy for your own body\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAs a rule of thumb, your waist size should be the same now as when you were 21. If you can\u2019t get into the same size trousers now, you are carrying too much fat and therefore at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even if you aren\u2019t overweight.\u201d\nDr Lucy Chambers, the head of research communications at Diabetes UK, which funded the study, said she welcomed the findings but cautioned that they were early, with full results expected in 2022.\n This article was amended on 29 September 2021 to restore the full comment made by Professor Roy Taylor concerning trouser size; it clarifies a \u201crule of thumb\u201d relating to waist circumference.",

        "content": "The European Super League still represents \u201can ongoing existential threat to the foundations and future of European football,\u201d Uefa has warned, as an aggressive court action originally brought by all 12 breakaway clubs continues to challenge its structure.\nAlthough nine of the original 12 clubs, including the six from the Premier League, rapidly stated they had withdrawn from the project after the vilification that met its launch on 18 April, they are all still members of the Super League company that is maintaining the legal challenge. The action in a Madrid court was taken against Uefa by the 12 clubs, including Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, on the day they announced their widely derided plan for a breakaway competition with themselves as permanent members, after months of secret discussions and planning.\nThe clubs\u2019 lawsuit principally attacks Uefa\u2019s position as the governing body and regulator of European football as well as the organiser of the Champions League, claiming it is a monopoly and anti-competitive, unfairly preventing clubs from forming their own competitions. Supporters\u2019 groups, FAs, Uefa, Fifa and politicians across Europe denounced the breakaway as a self-interested venture by rich clubs seeking a closed circle to make even more money, and the six Premier League clubs announced their withdrawal within two days.\nHowever, the court action they started is continuing and, although Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus are the only clubs actively supportive, the Super League company bringing the case has not been dissolved. All 12 clubs remain shareholders and the agreement they signed committing to the breakaway is still in place. City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs declined to answer questions from the Guardian about their intentions but several sources have said these four clubs are willing to try to dissolve the company or convene a board meeting to end the legal action.\nThat has led to some suspicion that Liverpool and United are privately still supportive of the breakaway despite their public statements. However, both clubs emphatically deny that, suggesting they are following different legal advice, which warns against taking action that could be regarded as defying Madrid court orders preventing Uefa from seeking liquidation of the company.\nThe threat against Uefa has been escalating even while the Super League project has generally been considered to have collapsed. On Tuesday Uefa has to answer to a ruling by the Madrid court last week that Uefa was in breach of previous orders not to take action against the Super League or its clubs while the case is continuing. It accused Uefa of acting \u201coutside the rule of law, actively promoting anticompetitive practices\u201d, for taking disciplinary proceedings against Real Madrid, Juventus and Barcelona and agreeing settlements with the other clubs.\nThe court threatened to impose fines and even file a complaint of \u201cjudicial disobedience\u201d with the Madrid public prosecutor.\nUefa declined to comment but is expected to argue that it has complied with the court, having late on Monday night declared the disciplinary proceedings \u201cnull and void\u201d and said that while the case is continuing, it will not collect the \u20ac15m agreed in settlements with each of the other nine clubs, which were to be used for grassroots football across Europe.\nThe Madrid judge has referred competition aspects of the clubs\u2019 lawsuit to the European Court of Justice, and there is intense frustration around football that Uefa is still having to fight a case brought by a self-selected few clubs, including the six Premier League clubs, despite their withdrawing from the breakaway.\nIn guidance recently issued to all Europe\u2019s national football associations, seen by the Guardian, Uefa warned: \u201cThe persistent pursuit of this ESL [European Super League] project and the resultant court cases comprise an ongoing existential threat to the foundations and future of European football and the European Sports Model.\u201d\nSetting out an adamant defence of European football\u2019s decades-long organisation through FAs, Uefa and Fifa, with promotion and relegation, agreed rules and some redistribution of revenues, Uefa\u2019s note states: \u201cThe choice is between solidarity and selfish indulgence,\u201d and that the Super League is \u201cpurely motivated by greed and a means to prevent competition\u201d.\nIt also warns against assuming that the court case will be dismissed easily: \u201cInaction, complacency and/or over-confidence with regards to the governmental and judicial rejection of this ESL project would be dangerously naive and risks inviting the unravelling of the European model of sport by aggressive commercial interests.\u201d\nLiverpool denied any suggestion that their US owners remain sympathetic to the breakaway, pointing to changes made to the club\u2019s constitution giving the Spirit of Shankly supporters\u2019 trust a determining vote if the club considers joining a new competition.\nA Liverpool spokesperson said: \u201cOur involvement in the proposed ESL plans has been discontinued. We are absolutely committed to following that through and there should be no ambiguity to suggest otherwise. We are acting on the best legal advice and approach to appropriately end our involvement.\u201d\nManchester United said in a statement: \u201cOur position as announced previously has not changed \u2013 we shall not be participating in the European Super League. The process for dissolving the European Super League entity is impacted by ongoing litigation in Spain. We are not involved in that litigation and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment.\u201d\nAdding to the perception that these clubs have created an unseemly mess, the Guardian understands that the Super League company still owes money to some of the people who worked for it up to its failed launch. The explanation given is understood to be that the company has not held a board meeting since April, so payment of its debts has not been authorised.",

All the other events have been around for over 150 years but the London Marathon is 40 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible what we\u2019ve become in that time, and we do not take that in any way lightly. It is fair to say we are talking to other terrestrial broadcasters. It is likely an announcement will be made this year.\u201d\nWhile the BBC remains the favourite to keep the rights, the news that the London Marathon could disappear will raise further concerns about the corporation\u2019s sports coverage. In recent years the broadcaster has lost the rights to show live coverage of the Open and the Masters, while its coverage of the Tokyo Olympics was less comprehensive than in previous Games after it sub-licensed its rights from Discovery.\nMore recently the BBC was also outbid by Channel 4 for the rights to share live coverage of Emma Raducanu\u2019s US Open final victory with Amazon Prime. And while Brasher praised the BBC\u2019s commitment to the race, and the fact its coverage of the 2020 event was nominated for a Bafta, he also hinted they would have to bring more to the table.\n\u201cWe have had a 40-year partnership with the BBC. And we have been absolutely delighted with that partnership. But we will explore all sorts of other opportunities.\n\u201cWe believe that this event lives on terrestrial TV. This event is for Britain. This event is for the world. It has a global reach. It is the world\u2019s most popular marathon, over 457,000 people applied for the 2020 event, and showcasing it to as many people as possible to make it inspire as many different communities as possible, is what we need to do.\n\u201cAnd that is what we\u2019re talking to broadcasters about, and about the future.\u201d\nBrasher predicted Mo Farah would return to the race after sustaining a stress fracture this year. \u201cWe look forward to him having a speedy recovery. And when he is back we will be having conversations with him. Do I think he can break the current European marathon record? Sure.\u201d",

Wherever people live or work, they must have reasonable and equal access to these services.\u201d\nAs Australia\u2019s main service provider, Telstra is contracted by government to deliver the USO. They have to provide standard telephone services and access to payphones.\nGregory cited Telstra, as the largest mobile coverage provider in rural and regional Australia, as an example of how connection speeds are advertised with a range that starts at 2 megabits (Mbps) per second irrespective of the mobile technology.\nHe said while the cost of mobile telecommunications is the same for regional, rural and remote areas as it is for urban areas, the access is not, according to a preliminary study carried out this year in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.\n\u201cAcross all regional areas studied, the average connection speeds were between 0-10 Mbps download and 0-2 Mbps upload,\u201d Gregory said.\nThe preliminary study found connection speeds were only above 20 Mbps in Perth and Kalgoorlie, as well as most small cells near mining sites.\nGregory said this was most likely because cells had been installed at the request of mining companies, including a service-level agreement which includes a minimum performance specification.\nThat mining sites could achieve better performance due to agreed standards affirmed Gregory\u2019s recommendation that the government should legislate minimum expectations for regional mobile telecommunications more broadly.\nTeresa Corbin, the chief executive officer of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN) which includes the Regional, Rural and Remote Communications Coalition, said greater transparency was necessary.\n\u201cThe information that is available to consumers is not adequate,\u201d Corbin said.\nShe said the coverage maps which providers make available are often difficult for people to understand and don\u2019t provide enough information on issues such as the capacity of the network, which will affect their use.\nGregory said mobile coverage \u201cfundamentally affects quality of life\u201d as well as the ability to conduct a business and national productivity.\nCorbin said the need for access to mobile data to conduct basic services, including government services, is especially important.\nShe said there is even greater dependency on mobile networks now as people rely on it for accessing government and banking services, emergency messages during national disasters as well second-factor authentication for a range of services.\nLuke Hartsuyker, the chair of the Regional Telecommunications Review, said \u201cthe committee is aware of the work of Professor Mark Gregory and is considering the topics raised in his article\u201d as well as other issues raised including the resilience of telecommunications infrastructure in emergencies and service reliability as well as digital awareness and skills.\n*This article was amended on 29 September 2020, to clarify the terms of the universal service obligation in relation to mobile coverage.",

Narita officials believe the creature may have come from the airport\u2019s retention pond, located about 100 metres from the runway, the newspaper added.\nAfter ANA had to cancel its 14 weekly flights to Honolulu due to the coronavirus pandemic, the airline has been using its fleet of A380s on domestic routes.

        "content": "She grew up in an artistic dynasty and was once rejected for a part by her dad. Now the director is turning her life into an epic new project. She reflects on Chekhov, Shakespeare and Iggy Pop\nWhat are memories? Stories we tell ourselves? Do they occupy neatly filed compartments in the brain? Perhaps \u2013 as Cicero and others argued \u2013 memory is a sort of palace or theatre: an atmospheric space filled with objects pregnant with meaning, or a realist stage set on which figures are forever materialising and disappearing.\nInside a swaggering 18th-century palazzo in Palermo, Irina Brook is trying to find answers to these questions \u2013 at least some of them. The project is entitled The House of Us. Three years in the planning and writing, the first piece she has created from scratch, it is a melange of autobiographical installations, photographs, video, music and theatrical performance. The audience will wander through it all, trespassers in Brook\u2019s memory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a journey through life and death, then back into life,\u201d she says on Zoom before rehearsals one morning. \u201cIt\u2019s quite mega,\u201d she adds brightly.\nBrook\u2019s life does offer some rich material. The eldest child of director Peter Brook and actor Natasha Parry, born in Paris but sent to school in England, she grew up on stage. As a kid, she hung out on the famous white box set of her father\u2019s 1970 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. \u201cWe got into trouble with my dad for dangling our feet over the edge,\u201d she giggles. At 20, she appeared in his A Cherry Orchard, playing an ardent Anya to her mother\u2019s heartsore Ranevskaya.\nShe became a director in her own right, running the prestigious Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de Nice and developing a reputation for playful revivals of opera and theatre classics. Her last major show in the UK was a pleasingly iconoclastic version of Ibsen\u2019s Peer Gynt that visited the Barbican in 2004, featuring a soundtrack by Iggy Pop \u2013 whom she once dated. Her partner Dan Jemmett is a director too; keeping it in the family business, they\u2019ve directed their daughter Ma\u00efa in Romeo and Juliet (Ma\u00efa also appeared in a Brook grandp\u00e8re production, The Tempest).\nPerhaps it was only a matter of time before she tried to put some of this stuff on stage. \u201cHouse of Us is literally my life,\u201d she declares. \u201cBorn in theatre, done theatre, directed theatre, been the head of a theatre. It\u2019s 50 years. Theatre, theatre, theatre.\u201d\nAnyone hoping for a kitchen-sink rendition of life behind the scenes in an artistic dynasty is likely to come away disappointed. At least as Brook describes it, The House of Us is more elusive than that. One part of the Fondazione Sant\u2019Elia, now Palermo\u2019s modern art museum, will feature 24 drama students rehearsing speeches from Chekhov in a space that resembles a dressing room. In another segment of the space, the actor Geoffrey Carey will offer ruminations on love and loss. Another room pays tribute to The Seagull; yet another features a recording of Natasha Parry reciting Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets. In its immersive meta-theatricality, it\u2019s possible to detect the spirit of Ariane Mnouchkine, whom Brook worked with in Paris.\nWhile everyone obsesses about Brook\u2019s father, it is in fact her mother that the piece is mainly concerned with. Acclaimed as one of the greatest theatrical talents of her generation, Parry was nonetheless defined by the man she married at 20. Though she worked with other directors \u2013 she was an imperious Lady Capulet in Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s 1968 movie of Romeo and Juliet \u2013 Parry threw herself into her husband\u2019s projects, joining his experimental company at the Bouffes du Nord and travelling with him on globetrotting voyages of discovery.\nBrook won\u2019t quite say that Parry\u2019s star was eclipsed, but her mother certainly struggled with the realities of being married to arguably the world\u2019s most famous theatre director while trying to maintain a home life. \u201cShe\u2019s the invisible one,\u201d says Brook quietly. \u201cThat was what spoke to me. The sense of being near the life of a great man, and the sense of making yourself invisible. And I realised, actually, that I had a huge part of her in me that I had to stand on.\u201d\nParry died in 2015. A few years later, Brook started to think that her grief could be put to good use. In the text that introduces The House of Us, she writes that her mother \u201cspent most of her life, when she wasn\u2019t acting, in a self-made golden cage of solitude\u201d, surrounding herself with piles of newspapers, unable to leave her Paris apartment before nightfall. \u201cI adored her,\u201d says Brook. \u201cShe was one of those princess mothers, you know, the most beautiful person that anyone knew. But there was a lot of absence.\u201d\nIf The House of Us sounds freeform, even a touch outlandish, Brook readily admits that this is the way it\u2019s often been for her. As a child, she fantasised about becoming a film star, and was more than a little put out to realise she might need to attend, say, drama school. She studied at the Stella Adler Studio in New York, but was overcome with fear and hated it. \u201cStella was such a dragon! She screamed at everyone, especially the girls.\u201d\nWas this when she met Iggy, I ask mock-casually. \u201cOh, we dated in New York, but we met in London. I ran away from boarding school and went to see him, then fought my way through backstage and sat on the floor of his dressing room gazing up at him while he was having a shower.\u201d Her voice softens. \u201cHe was very wild, but I was a very demure English schoolgirl.\u201d\nWork came as a performer, initially off-Broadway and then in London. But she often felt she was struggling to keep her head above water. She got down to the last two for the part of Lucy Honeychurch in the Merchant Ivory A Room With a View, losing out to Helena Bonham Carter. Another low point, after long periods out of work, was touring in a English regional version of Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover in 1995, which required substantial amounts of on-stage nudity \u2013 something she\u2019d not fully digested before taking to the stage one night in Hull.\n\u201cI suffered for 12 agonising years as an actor,\u201d she says. She switched to directing not long afterwards.\nI read that, a few years before appearing in her father\u2019s Cherry Orchard, he actually turned her down for the part. True story, she replies. \u201cI did an audition with one of his wonderful actors and he must have said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s do a bit more work.\u2019\u201d What happened? \u201cHe must have said to me, \u2018I feel that you\u2019re just not ready yet.\u2019 I grabbed my suitcase and left. I was furious.\u201d\nWhen I suggest that a psychoanalyst would have a field day, she politely evades. \u201cI\u2019m always telling my children about how I\u2019m a pushover everywhere else, but in the work you just cannot be swayed by anything.\u201d\nAre either of her kids \u2013 she also has a son \u2013 inclined to follow her footsteps and make a life in theatre? She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m one of those terrible stage mothers, saying, \u2018Get yourself an agent!\u2019\u201d\nAnd how is her father, who turned 96 earlier this year? \u201cHe\u2019s very frail. But he\u2019s absolutely full of ideas and thoughts and memories. And he\u2019s still working, which is inspiring.\u201d\nBrook, who will be 60 next year, is given to peals of laughter and galloping digressions encompassing everything from her thoughts on ecology (a late-blooming interest) to the stubborn French theatrical conservatism she encountered in Nice. Maybe the idea of art imitating life is getting to me, but I find it hard not to think of Irina in Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters, whom she was \u2013 of course \u2013 partly named after: another dreamer, slightly wild, perennially brimming with hope. \u201cI do have a Pollyanna side, believe that everything\u2019s for the best in the best possible world,\u201d she agrees.\nThe House of Us will travel to Florence and Venice, then hopefully to Japan. Brook is eager to persuade a British or American producer \u2013 she fantasises about it being at the Armory in New York \u2013 but it remains to be seen if anyone will bite. She laughs. \u201cI have enough material to fill Buckingham Palace at this point.\u201d You suspect this will become a life work, in every sense.\nA few days after we first speak, I message to check a few things. A long paragraph comes back, saying that, really, the project is about stepping out of the shadows, overcoming her own creative insecurities. \u201cSomeone said to me a few years ago, when you become a sun, the shadows disappear,\u201d it reads.\n The House of Us is at the Fondazione Sant\u2019Elia, Palermo, 29 September-3 October.",

They may be excluded from social rights such as pensions, decent housing and healthcare.\u00a0\nIn 2016, it was estimated that more than 7 million Britons were in precarious employment. An EU report recognises precariousness as a problematic practice.\n\u201cThe system is sick everywhere across Europe. It\u2019s based on cheap prices for meat, on the exploitation of labour,\u201d said Enrico Somaglia, deputy secretary general of the European Federation of Food, Agriculture and Tourism Trade Unions. \u201cYou have workers elbow to elbow doing the same work, but under different conditions.\u201d\n The Guardian has heard how precarious workers often have undefined working hours, zero-hours contracts, bogus self-employed status and no sick pay. Workers describe living in an extremely precarious state in countries where they do not speak the language and therefore struggle to understand their agreements and legal rights.\n\u201cThey can fire you instantly and you can lose everything,\u201d said a Romanian worker in the Netherlands.\nIn the Netherlands \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s largest meat exporters with sales worth \u20ac8.8bn (\u00a37.5bn) last year \u2013 the labour inspectorate said migrants, primarily on precarious contracts, make up to 90% of the workforce.\nThe UK\u2019s meat processing plants are struggling with a shortage of workers as they gear up for Christmas, as many of the eastern European workers employed in the sector returned to their home countries during the Covid pandemic and have not come back. Unions predict the use of agency and subcontracted migrant labour will become more prevalent because local people do not want to work in meat plants.\nUnions are calling for an immediate Europe-wide ban on the use of precarious workers in meat plants. \u201cWithout a shadow of a doubt, agencies and subcontracted work should be banned,\u201d said Bev Clarkson of Unite Union.\nSerife Erol, researcher at Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany, said: \u201cIf the meat processing companies cannot get the margins through selling the products, they have the opportunity of getting it through the payments of their workers.\u201d\nEU enlargement from 2004 \u2013 and free movement of people across Europe \u2013 brought a vast pool of people from Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Hungary willing to migrate for work opportunities.\nAcross Europe, the freedom of movement for workers has been misused, said \u00d6zlem Alev Demirel, MEP from the German Die Linke party. \u201cEmployers have depressed wages by bringing workers from countries where wages are lower, and the social security systems are weak, and this is not acceptable.\u201d She said the principle of the same wage for the same work at the same place must be upheld across Europe.\nAs the economies of countries such as Poland improved, and the need for a replenishable source of cheap labour increased, the search has extended across the world to countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Georgia, India, China and Armenia.\nRomanian agencies are now bringing workers across the world from south Asia, specifically Nepal and Sri Lanka. Their visas are dependent on the jobs they get; if they are fired, they become illegal immigrants. \u201cIn Romania, [companies] are abusing Nepalese workers in the same way Romanians are abused elsewhere,\u201d said Nora Labo, who worked for the Independent Workers Union in Ireland until earlier this year.\nNicolas Schmit, EU commissioner for jobs and social rights, said that it is up to member states to uphold labour law. \u201cEU law is clear: all workers hired via agencies and subcontractors should be guaranteed the same rights as permanent employees. National authorities must enforce these rules.\u201d\nKarsten Maier, secretary general of UECBV, which represents 20,000 companies in the livestock and meat trade across Europe, as well as Japan, Russia and Ukraine, said labour conditions were not part of its work but were the responsibility of the companies, as well as the relevant authorities. \u201cAbuse of any kind will not be tolerated,\u201d said Maier, adding cases should be prosecuted accordingly.\n This article was amended on 30 September 2021 to clarify a quote from Nora Labo.\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

Her hands bled from blisters that burst as she repeatedly hauled carcasses, but she would wait until she got home to sterilise her wounds with ammonia. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t do your job well, you\u2019d be pushed \u2013 they didn\u2019t care if your hands were full of blood,\u201d she says.\nThis wasn\u2019t the life Margot* imagined when she left her job in a clothes factory near her home village in Romania in search of better prospects for her young family in western Europe. She thought labour conditions in the Netherlands \u2013 where she worked for three years in a meat factory \u2013 would be much more favourable than in her home country. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so awful.\u201d \n Life as a meat worker can be brutally hard. But Margot soon realised there were two types of workers: employees, who she says were mainly Dutch; and precarious workers, mostly migrants like herself, who had to work harder and faster but earned less. \u201cThe ones hired directly by the company have more rights, get more relaxed work, stability and hours,\u201d she says.\nEurope\u2019s meat industry is a multibillion pound powerhouse, employing about 1 million people. But unions estimate that thousands of workers in some countries are precariously employed through subcontractors and agencies, with some earning 40% to 50% less than employees in the same factories.\nAlthough there is no universally accepted definition of \"precarious work\", the term is used to describe workers who have temporary employment that does not offer the security and protection of employed work.\nFor example, it may involve zero-hours contracts or unpredictable/variable work or hours, non-standard or atypical employment contracts, designation of bogus \"self-employed\" status, below-average pay, an elevated threat of losing work at short notice, along with minimum or no holiday, parental and sick pay.\u00a0\u00a0\nIndividuals in precarious work may be at a high risk of in-work poverty and economic vulnerability. They may be excluded from social rights such as pensions, decent housing and healthcare.\u00a0\nIn 2016, it was estimated that more than 7 million Britons were in precarious employment. An EU report recognises precariousness as a problematic practice.\nThe Guardian has spoken to officials, labour experts and workers, like Margot, who describe how the industry across Europe \u2013 including the UK \u2013 has become reliant on outsourced labour, with a two-tier employment system.\n\u201cThe whole system is really rotten,\u201d says Nora Labo, a union official in Ireland who spoke before the Irish parliament last year about meat factories and the \u201cunscrupulous practices\u201d of some agencies involved. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for employers to avoid all responsibility towards their workers.\u201d\nEurope\u2019s meat industry came into sharp political focus in 2020 when plants became hotspots for coronavirus transmission. Precarious workers were particularly vulnerable, as many say they did not have sick pay and they feared for their jobs if they could not work because of illness. In addition, substandard accommodation \u2013 often cramped, squalid conditions \u2013 made social distancing or self-isolation extremely challenging. It was reported that some companies also lacked the necessary data to be able to trace the outbreak.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the subcontracting model in Europe that is at the core of the exploitation and rights abuses in the meat industry,\u201d argues James Ritchie, assistant general of the Geneva-based International Union of Food Workers. The use of agency workers is more prevalent in the European meat industry than anywhere else in the developed world, he adds.\nUnions are calling for an immediate Europe-wide ban on the use of precarious workers in meat plants. \u201cYou have workers elbow to elbow doing the same work, but under different conditions,\u201d says Enrico Somaglia, deputy secretary general at the European Federation of Food, Agriculture and Tourism Trade Unions. \u201cIt\u2019s [a system] based on cheap prices for meat, on the exploitation of labour.\u201d\nIntermediaries \u2013 such as subcontractors, solo agents, multiservice companies, work agencies and co-operatives \u2013 have mushroomed to fulfil the industry\u2019s need for a replenishable source of low-paid, flexible workers. They often recruit and pay workers and manage their shifts; they also frequently provide and coordinate their housing and transport.\nThe relationship between a meat company and worker is not that of employer and employee; rather, the intermediary either acts as the employer, or the worker is designated \u2013 often incorrectly \u2013 as self-employed. This system can hollow out companies\u2019 responsibility for their workers, and allow them to avoid legal liability for issues such as pay, working times, accidents and injuries, in a sector recognised as dangerous and physically challenging.\nThe Guardian has learned how precarious workers often have undefined working hours, zero-hours contracts and no overtime or statutory sick pay. They describe living in a state of extreme insecurity in countries where they do not speak the language and struggle to understand agreements and their legal rights. Workers also report having to pay agencies high costs for overcrowded housing, and may working for hours \u2013 sometimes weeks \u2013 without pay. Those living in housing supplied by intermediaries told the Guardian they feel powerless and fear they will end up on the streets if work ends.\nA \u201cphased\u201d contract system, operated by some agencies, can keep workers on the lowest pay for extended periods. In the Netherlands, for example, workers allege they are often let go before they are legally due a pay increase or pension contributions, then rehired on a similar contract. The Dutch Meat Association says it could only speak for its members, but it believed the practice was anything but widespread, and nevertheless it should be banned. It says it has recently been discussing this so-called \u201crevolving door\u201d construct with labour unions, the minister of social affairs and employment and the minister of food and agriculture and says that by the end of 2021, it should be a thing of the past.\nAbout 62% of the 97,000 meat workers in the UK are EU nationals. The British Meat Processors Association says most sites across the UK use agency staff, but it does not collect data on the exact percentage of workers this represents. The sector relies on agency and subcontracted labour to fulfil what the industry calls seasonal needs, which can lead to significant increases in workers at plants at some points during the year.\nA 2010 Equality and Human Rights Commission report found mistreatment and exploitation across the UK meat industry\u2019s workforce. Agency workers said they were treated worse than employees and felt like \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d.\nTrade unions estimate agency and subcontracted workers make up about 10% to 15% of the workforce in UK factories where unions are recognised, but they have no data for non-unionised plants. \u201cThe working conditions of agency and employed staff are the same, but agency workers get lower-paid jobs,\u201d says Bev Clarkson of the Unite union.\nIn June, the UK meat industry warned it was \u201creaching a point of despair\u201d because of the shrinking pool of labour as a result of Brexit. Clarkson predicts that post-Brexit, the use of agency and subcontracted migrant labour will become more prevalent because local people do not want to work in meat plants.\nIn Italy, more than 21,000 people work in the meat industry. More than 50% of the workforce in slaughtering and 25% in meat processing are migrants from eastern Europe, the Balkans, north and central Africa, and east Asia. They are increasingly employed through workers\u2019 co-operatives, where they can cost meat companies up to 40% less than their directly employed counterparts, according to unions.\nMany of the workers\u2019 co-operatives have been found to be bogus enterprises, fraudulently set up by meat companies to make use of their labour flexibility and tax advantages, according to EU-funded research into Italy\u2019s pork industry. Meat plants frequently subcontract co-operatives from the transport sector to avoid the higher wages covered by the food sector\u2019s collective agreement, a strategy also documented in the Belgian meat industry.\nThe emergence of the labour intermediaries system reflects broader shifts in the European meat industry over recent decades, including consolidation of market share by a handful of companies and a rapidly declining number of small independently owned butchers and abattoirs. Thousands of people work in the large slaughterhouses, which can operate for 24 hours a day, satisfying the major retailers\u2019 and food service providers\u2019 system of ordering extensive quantities of cheap meat on demand.\nThis system has been made possible thanks to a vast pool of workers from Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Hungary willing to migrate for work after the enlargement of the EU that began in 2004. Many came from poor, post-industrial villages and towns, such as former mining regions in Moldova and Romania with few employment opportunities for younger people. Their route into the labour market is often driven by intermediaries, and frequently advertised on social media. \u201cIt is a system of poverty exploitation,\u201d says Volker Br\u00fcggenj\u00fcrgen, chair of the charity Caritas Association for the district of G\u00fctersloh, in Germany. \u201cPeople are deceived with the promise of a better life.\u201d\nAcross Europe, the freedom of movement for workers has been misused, says \u00d6zlem Alev Demirel, MEP from the German Die Linke party. \u201cEmployers have depressed wages by bringing workers from countries where wages are lower, and the social security systems are weak, and this is not acceptable.\u201d She says the principle of the same wage for the same work at the same place must be upheld across Europe.\nAs the economies of countries such as Poland have improved, and the need for a replenishable source of cheap labour increased, the search has extended to countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Georgia, India, China and Armenia.\nKarsten Maier, secretary general of UECBV, an organisation representing 20,000 companies in the livestock and meat trade from across Europe, as well as Japan, Russia and Ukraine, says labour conditions are not part of its work but are the responsibility of the companies, as well as the relevant authorities. \u201cAbuse of any kind will not be tolerated,\u201d says Maier, adding cases should be prosecuted accordingly.\nThere appears to be dwindling oversight of meat plants and their workforce. Labour inspections have \u201ccollapsed\u201d across Europe in the past decade due to austerity measures, while a 2019 EU report on the meat industry highlighted the lack of minimum standards for inspections and standardised definitions of self-employment.\n\u201cOn the national level in many countries, there is no real oversight or control over recruitment agencies,\u201d says Lilana Keith, senior advocacy officer at the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants.\nIn 2019, a new agency, the European Labour Authority (ELA), was set up to support member states to carry out inspections and monitor the enforcement of labour laws across Europe. If possible cases of abuse are found, the ELA will be able to initiate cross-border inspections.\n\u201cMigrant workers in the meat industry are an invisible group,\u201d says Martijn Huysmans, assistant professor at Utrecht University School of Economics. \u201cIn Dutch stores you can see what kind of life an animal has had \u2013 we have a star system for animal welfare. But ironically, you can\u2019t see what conditions people in the slaughterhouse were working under.\u201d\nThis invisibility of many precarious workers extends beyond the workplace. Language barriers, unsocial and long working hours and a lack of information all serve to perpetuate exploitation for precarious migrants, says Paul-Octavian Idu, who gives free advice to meat plant workers at a support centre run by German NGO Arbeit und Leben. \u201cThey remain in a \u2018social ghetto\u2019,\u201d he says.\nYet workers like Margot continue to seek jobs in western Europe. A few months ago, she found work on a zero-hours contract with another agency at a meat plant in the Netherlands that paid \u20ac10.80 (\u00a39.25) an hour for 12-hour shifts, seven days in a row. She says she was underpaid, and left after a week.\n* Name changed\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

        "content": "Deep sea mining firms claim their rare metals are necessary to power clean tech \u2013 but with even major electric car firms now backing a moratorium, critics say there is an alternative\nMore in this series\n Race to the bottom \u2013 the disastrous rush to mine the deep sea\n Covid tests and superbug killers: how the deep sea is key to fighting pandemics\nAt the Goodwood festival of speed near Chichester, the crowds gathered at the hill-climb circuit to watch the world\u2019s fastest cars roar past, as they do every year. But not far from the high-octane action, there was a new, and quieter, attraction: a display of the latest electric vehicles, from the \u00a328,000 Mini Electric to the \u00a32m Lotus Evija hypercar. Even here, at one of the biggest events in Britain\u2019s petrolhead calendar, it\u2019s clear the days of the internal combustion engine are numbered.\nAs countries strive to meet stringent carbon-emission targets, and vehicle-makers phase out combustion engines, 145m electric vehicles are predicted to be on the roads within a decade, up from 11m last year. The car batteries they require, along with storage batteries for solar and wind power, have sent demand for metals soaring, taking mining firms to the bottom of the sea in the hunt for those metals.\nThousands of metres below the ocean\u2019s surface lie millions of potato-sized rocks known as nodules: a rich source of nickel, copper, manganese and cobalt. In June, an application was filed to start mining these deposits in two years\u2019 time. As well as the demand for minerals for smartphones and other electronic devices, and the difficulty of extracting them from the land in a sustainable way, the companies behind deep-sea mining say we have no choice: if we want to make the transition to renewable energy, we must plumb the ocean depths.\nDeep-sea mining involves retrieving mineral deposits from the area of the ocean below 200 metres down to the sea bed, which is the largest and least explored environment on Earth, occupying 65% of the planet\u2019s surface. Mining firms say that metals found there, such as copper, nickel, aluminium, lithium, cobalt and manganese, are needed to make batteries, smartphones and solar panels.\u00a0\nWhen will it happen?So far, 31 exploration licences have been granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body, and 1.5m sq km has been set aside, equivalent to an area the size of Mongolia, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as along the mid-Atlantic ridge. The decision by Nauru to trigger a rule forcing the ISA to approve a Mining Code \u2013 a set of rules \u201cto regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals in the international seabed area\u201d \u2013 will likely lead to full exploitation contracts in less than two years.\nWhy is it a problem?Mining could do huge damage to the deep sea and the creatures and ecosystems that exist there. Underwater ecosystems such as volcanic mountains, hydrothermal vents and deep-sea trenches are still poorly understood. Many endemic deep-sea species could be wiped out by the creation of a single large mine, and many other creatures will be affected by noise, light pollution and plumes of mining sediment.\u00a0\nWhat can be done?\u00a0An immediate moratorium on deep-sea mining must be instituted while scientists assess the potential damage to biodiversity, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u00a0(IUCN). Fundamentally, the IUCN also says people need to recycle and reuse products so there is less demand for extraction of natural resources. New types of batteries are also being designed that do not require metals from the sea bed.\u00a0\nChris Michael and Phoebe Weston\n\u201cWe now have the technology available to us to explore more of the ocean in the next 10 years than we have had in the last 10,000,\u201d says Oliver Steeds, founder and chief executive of Nekton, a deep-sea research foundation and a participant at Goodwood\u2019s Future Lab. His team uses technology such as autonomous underwater vehicles, or robots, to map the deep sea \u2013 not for mining, but to promote ocean conservation. Nekton led a deep-sea mission to the Indian Ocean in 2019, which broadcast live from a submersible 200 metres below the waves.\nThe advances in mining and exploration technology represent \u201can extraordinary opportunity for progress\u201d, Steeds says. \u201cBut also it represents a threat, whether through deep-sea mining or further industrialisation and overfishing.\n\u201cToo often, the ocean is out of sight, out of mind. But we need to discover what\u2019s there before we destroy it.\u201d\nMore than 90% of the estimated 2.2 million species in the ocean remain undescribed. And the two-year countdown to deep-sea mining has prompted warnings from scientists that we have not sufficiently understood its potential impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.\nDouglas McCauley, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and director of the Benioff Ocean Initiative, says the potential impact of deep-sea mining keeps him up at night.\nElectrification of vehicle fleets is a \u201cpositive pathway\u201d to reduce carbon emissions, says McCauley. But he accuses deep-sea mining companies of a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that we must mine the ocean to meet renewable energy\u2019s demand for metals.\n\u201cThere are some very significant questions being raised by scientists about the impacts of ocean mining,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much extinction could be generated? How long will it take these extremely low-resilience systems to recover? What impact will it have on the ocean\u2019s capacity to capture carbon?\u201d\nCampaigners highlight the uncertainty in assumptions behind often wildly different projected metal demand. In July, Greenpeace researchers showed many projections for metal demand by 2050 assumed ongoing use of cobalt and nickel-dependent lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and storage, despite alternatives being developed, including Tesla\u2019s use of lithium iron phosphate batteries, which require neither metal.\nKevin Bridgen, senior scientist for Greenpeace Research Laboratories, says: \u201cPeople are saying \u2018we are not going to have enough metals if we carry on doing as we\u2019ve always done\u2019, but changes are already taking place.\u201d\nIncreasingly, car companies are joining in the revolt. In March, BMW and Volvo, with Google and Samsung, became the first global companies to sign up to the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s (WWF) call for a moratorium on deep-sea mining. In backing the call, WWF says, the companies committed to not sourcing any metals from the seabed, to exclude them from their supply chains and not to finance deep-sea mining, until the risks are better understood and the alternatives exhausted.\nIn calling for a ban, Claudia Becker, BMW\u2019s expert in sustainable supply-chain management, says she fears mining the deep sea could have \u201cirreversible consequences\u201d.\n\u201cWe came to the conclusion we are missing an understanding of the biodiversity impacts of deep-sea mining. We wanted to send a clear signal to the industry that until these issues are resolved, minerals from the deep seabed are not an option for us.\u201d\nOne of several alternatives being explored is to build batteries using widely available metals, instead of the rare and expensive minerals used today.\nBecker believes mining the seabed could be avoided by turning to alternative, less damaging metals, or by designing batteries that require fewer minerals. She cites China-based BYD (Build Your Dreams), the world\u2019s second-largest electric vehicle manufacturer, which announced this year it would no longer use cobalt in batteries.\nClaes Eliasson, senior vice-president of media relations at Volvo, says that its AB Volvo division \u2013 which makes lorries, buses and construction equipment \u2013 is betting on three vehicle types: electric, hydrogen and biofuels. It is collaborating with Daimler Trucks to produce hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul vehicles.\nThere are also growing calls for better recycling \u2013 including taking old batteries from rubbish dumps. \u201cWe are accumulating metal-rich lithium-iron batteries,\u201d McCauley says of these waste sites. He is optimistic about recycling, seeing \u201cexciting developments\u201d in recovering minerals from batteries, and because he believes there is a \u201chuge amount of money to be made\u201d from pioneering a cheaper, energy-dense battery.\nResearchers are tackling how to recycle the millions of electric vehicle batteries manufacturers expect to produce over the coming decades. Electric vehicle (EV) batteries are not designed for recycling, says Andy Abbott, professor of physical chemistry at Leicester University. \u201cMost EV batteries have very small cells, which are put into modules and the modules put into packs. To give an idea, the Tesla Model S has got 4,600 cells in it,\u201d he points out.\nThe difficulty, he says, is to find a cost-effective way to separate the cells, which are held together with tough and highly toxic glue, to access the metals inside.\n\u201cSome people are suggesting glue-less cells and making disassembly easier,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at using robots that can pull apart batteries. We\u2019ve shown that, economically, it\u2019s better if you can disassemble it.\u201d\nProduct design and \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d is another major hurdle for metal recycling. In 2019, 53.6m tonnes of electronic waste was generated globally, only 17.4%, or 9.3m, of which was recycled. But this too is set to change, with the International Telecommunication Union setting a target of 30% recycling by 2030.)\nIn 2018, China began to hold vehicle manufacturers responsible for ensuring that batteries are recycled and the country now recycles more lithium-ion batteries than the rest of the world combined. Last year, BYD launched the blade battery, which stores flat cells directly inside, allowing them to be removed by hand.\nAbbott predicts lithium-iron batteries will be recycled more efficiently in the next \u201c10 to 15 years\u201d. But he adds that they almost certainly will not be the main technology in 20 to 30 years\u2019 time. \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving market,\u201d he says.\nThe Metals Company, formerly DeepGreen, one of several companies planning to mine nodules in the Pacific, has accused BMW, Volvo and the other companies of \u201cirresponsible\u201d claims. In a statement in March it asked: \u201cWhere exactly will BMW get the battery metals it needs to fully electrify its products, and with what impact to our climate?\u201d\nBut its claim that mining metals from the ocean had the \u201cleast planetary impact\u201d has been called into question.\nIn July, the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, Greenpeace USA and Global Witness sent a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, questioning DeepGreen\u2019s environmental impact and feasibility statement.\n\u201cDeepGreen is offering a false or dystopian choice\u201d between destroying the rainforest or the ocean environment, says Matthew Gianni, co-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to do either. We, as a society \u2013 whether consumers, private companies and/or, in particular, governments investing in renewable energy technologies \u2013 can and should use substitute materials and metals in the construction of electric batteries for vehicles and other energy storage technologies.\u201d\nTMC declined to comment for this article.\nIt is not just activists who are concerned. BMW\u2019s Becker says that at least mines on land, although often beset by allegations of child labour, deforestation and pollution, can at least be inspected and held to account.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that every mine in the world is perfect,\u201d says Becker. \u201cBut we have tools, like due diligence standards, that we can apply to mines operating under these standards and we can improve them.\u201d\n\u201cLooking at the machinery involved in deep-sea mining, it has hardly been tested at all, smaller versions maybe. But without testing, how do we trust these methods?\u201d\nEliasson, at Volvo, says: \u201cIf all the specialists were telling us deep-sea mining is a simple easy option with no impacts on biodiversity, we would have no problem with it. But to date, the research is not there.\n\u201cDeep-sea mining in a very sensitive environment is not a good idea until science has come up with a good way to do it. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\nMcCauley agrees. \u201cWe have an exciting opportunity, and obligation, to harness the full power of science and human ingenuity to accelerate the mass production of electric vehicles in a way that doesn\u2019t create a new environmental disaster in our ocean, and that minimises the impacts of mining on land.\u201d\nTMC were approached for comment but did not respond.",

        "content": "In the new documentary The Gig Is Up, film-maker Shannon Walsh travels around the world to uncover the human cost of the new way many of us work\nJason Edwards would find it a struggle to pass a job interview with his prominent gold teeth and criminal record. But he has something more powerful than a suit, shirt, tie, clean shave and polished shoes. He has a laptop and guile.\nEdwards works from home by filling in online surveys. It is not typically lucrative work, paying just a few cents. But Edwards, who is white, figured out that by posing as an African American Republican, his opinions would be much sought after. He reckons he has earned more than $30,000.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t cheat the system the way I do, you\u2019re not going to make a respectable amount of money,\u201d he observes from a modest house in Mims, Florida, where he cares for an ailing mother who loves smoking and lottery scratchcards.\nThis is just one bittersweet story told in The Gig Is Up, a new documentary that shines a light on the human side of the gig economy, now worth more than $5tn a year globally and spurred further by the coronavirus pandemic. It includes, of course, the now familiar hustle of driving or delivering for companies such as Uber, Amazon and Deliveroo.\nBut there is also a bigger and more mysterious army of \u201cghost workers\u201d: millions of people around the world who provide the elusive human factor in artificial intelligence, from completing surveys to transcribing audio recordings or tagging images and other data. While they gain work-from-home flexibility, they earn a pittance, must provide their own computer, broadband and power and have to cope without a safety net, trade union or the consolation of office banter.\n\u201cThere is a Big Brother aspect to that, where there\u2019s no one to call,\u201d says the director, Shannon Walsh, by phone from Vancouver, Canada. \u201cThat was one of the big things we heard around the world, that sense that you were at the peril of a machine. Get a bad rating, if someone\u2019s in a bad mood one day, and you lose your job and your livelihood. It\u2019s a next level of precarity.\u201d\nThe Gig Is Up is the fifth feature film for Walsh, 45, a Canadian who has had spells living in South Africa and Hong Kong and always had an interest in uncovering stories that are most neglected. She was intrigued by the way gig work offers the illusion of technological utopia on slick phone apps but hides an entire underclass of workers.\n\u201cIn the early 2000s we used to talk about globalisation and the outsourcing of jobs into parts of the world where you could find cheap labour,\u201d she says. \u201cWith the advent of the platform economy, we really see this flattening of the global workforce. The haves and have nots each exist in each country.\n\u201cSomeone doing a job in rural Florida is actually doing the exact same job as someone in Lagos or someone in Mumbai. I found it fascinating how that shift has happened with the growth of multinational corporations. What we saw in those early days has really transformed into something else.\u201d\nWithin the US, Walsh found that gig work throws a lifeline to people shut out of the formal economy for reasons such as disability, caring for an elderly parent or children, or having undocumented immigrant status or a criminal record that would show up on a background check. In some cases, they are desperate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the idea of a student making pizza money: that is what the companies want us to believe. It\u2019s folks who need this kind of work and don\u2019t have a lot of other options in many cases and who are working for multiple platforms to try and scrape together a living.\u201d\nA delivery driver knows that a single spilled drink or spoiled meal can result in career-ending complaint from a customer. On the flip side some \u201cindependent contractors\u201d, as they are euphemistically known, relish the autonomy and flexibility of not being tied to the 9-to-5 commute, freeing them to attend their child\u2019s school concert or sports game or explore their own creativity\nWalsh\u2019s travels for the film included Nigeria, where gig work is both liberating and crushing. Some perform menial online tasks for Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk platform, sometimes for just a few cents, and are paid in Amazon gift cards.\nOne Nigerian interviewee, a trained architect, does 3D design work for architecture firms in the US along with far more soulless work. Walsh says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got this paradox where you\u2019ve got folks like him working for Amazon gift cards in one breath and then also having this incredible untapped amount of human creativity and expertise.\u201d\nShe extrapolates: \u201cThis new kind of evolution of platform-based work can\u2019t be painted with one brush. There\u2019s this incredible sense of human creativity connected like we\u2019ve never had before and yet at the same time, it\u2019s a race to the bottom in terms of not taking into account what that means for the transformation of labour and the future of work.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to ask people to be available and ask them to bring their creativity and human intelligence to the table, how does that shape the way we have to think about what we need around labour? In the US, the idea of having a base of support and security that is not reliant on the companies doing that is going to be ground zero in the conversation.\u201d\nMany of the film\u2019s subjects speak wearily about the isolating effects of gig work, especially since the apps are actively designed to prevent workers meeting each other and organising. But Walsh observes: \u201cWhat\u2019s always amazing is that, like the grass that grows through the cracks in the pavement, people find ways to find each other.\n\u201cWe heard great stories in India about folks doing platform based work on computers who would find each other on Reddit forums, call each other and just leave the phone off the hook while they worked because that sense of community around work is essential. People will find a way to be in community.\u201d\nThe process of how society, and notoriously tech-illiterate governments, get to grips with gig work, regulates it and forges a new social contract is only just beginning. Last week elected officials in New York City passed legislation for gig economy and food delivery workers, setting minimum pay, allowing workers to keep more of their tips and limiting how far workers can be asked to travel for deliveries.\nBut there is a long way to go to curb the power of corporations that have found in gig work a way an army of labour that not even 19th-century coal barons and factory bosses could have dreamed of.\nWalsh comments: \u201cThe big names are problematic on so many levels. They\u2019re trying to bend the rules for their benefit and governments by and large for a long time have been letting them do that. It\u2019s also that question of policy not quite being where tech is. It\u2019s so often the case that stuff\u2019s already happened by the time governments catch up to understanding what is happening.\u201d\nBack in Mims, Florida, Jason Edwards cannot bear to watch The Gig Is Up because his mother died just after it was made. But he still has the gig economy. Walsh reflects: \u201cI really felt a lot for him through the process. What are the options in a place like where he lives?\n\u201cAnd this is true for a lot of the US, unfortunately. What are the work options that are available to you? A lot of them are not good. Like he said when I first interviewed him, \u2018Well, before this, I was dealing drugs.\u2019 What else is he going to do?\u201d\nThe Gig Is Up is out in the US on 8 October with a UK date to be announced",

That word made more than the odd appearance in writeups of Vincenzo Natali\u2019s 1997 film Cube \u2013 to which Meander, set almost entirely inside a series of shoulder-width vents filled with fiendish traps, bears more than a faint resemblance.\nThere\u2019s the briefest of preambles as woolly hatted Lisa (Gaia Weiss), lying on a wintry track with suicidal intentions, is picked up by gravel-voiced driver Adam (Peter Franz\u00e9n). Their chat is turning existential when she realises, by the tattoo on his hand, that he is the escaped murderer the radio is talking about \u2013 and he attacks. Lisa wakes, to her disbelief, inside a small industrial space with perforated walls, and the only route out seems to be through a hatch giving on to the tightest of corridors. Of course, several feet farther down, the roof begins to close in.\nDespite a title more suited to a film about long walks in a park with a mate, Meander\u2019s basic rat-in-a-maze premise has an innate tension almost impossible to squander \u2013 even when the traps, as here, are a touch on the unimaginative side. The rat in this case, Weiss, is a lithe former ballet dancer who relishes the role\u2019s physicality but she also \u2013 reminiscent of Noomi Rapace \u2013 combines it with a soulful pathos that she exploits well in her many closeups. It\u2019s a shame that the inner turmoil being forced to the surface in this pressure cooker is a tacked-on subplot about her dead daughter that feels more of a hassle than the singed troglodyte pursuing her.\nMore intriguing is the suggestion that an extraterrestrial hand, with hard-to-fathom motives, is at the controls \u2013 as suggested in a spellbinding celestial flashback. Director Mathieu Turi films this very well, as well as the haunting opening on the road. Perhaps he\u2019ll be able to find more possibilities in the fresh air outside the crawlspace of genre.\n Meander is available on digital platforms on 4 October.",

Everyone flocks there and \u2026 within a few hours it is out again,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\nMadderson said his members would not be placing limits on buying. \u201cIt is confrontational, we don\u2019t want to put our staff at risk with confronting their customers, so that has got some merits, but also a lot of demerits.\u201d\nHe also said he did not condone profiteering and called on members to think twice about putting up their prices.\n\u201cThe one thing we do not condone is profiteering in situations like this,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of our members, the independents, have a regular customer base and if they offend their customer base they don\u2019t deserve to have them when this crisis is over,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have got long memories and I would urge anybody who thinks about trying to make a fast buck to think again because it just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nNo 10 said army drivers would be ready to help deliver petrol and diesel on a short-term basis, but stopped short of an immediate deployment, even though some essential workers have not been able to carry out their jobs without fuel.\nTobias Ellwood, the chair of parliament\u2019s defence select committee, has said the army should be mobilised, not just put on standby, to \u201cregain public confidence\u201d and halt panic-buying.\n\u201cThe country wants to see the government is in command and it has a clear cross-Whitehall plan,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWe have gone from 1% fuel pump shortages to 90% so altering people\u2019s buying behaviour to prevent the panic buying and going back to previous purchasing patterns requires regaining the confidence of the nation.\n\u201cI believe the army should not just be put on standby but in fact mobilised, be seen to be used. That will help ease the pressure on shortages of course, it will return public confidence, and then on top of that there is the bigger issue about articulating a clear strategy to alleviate the chronic shortage of lorry drivers.\u201d\nThe shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the failure stemmed from government inaction, rather than blaming the public.\nHe said the HGV driver shortage was a \u201ccatastrophic failure of leadership\u201d and said he had warned the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, about the impending disaster.\n\u201cWe find ourselves in this position because of a complete failure of the government to lead and to plan ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cI and other shadow cabinet colleagues wrote to Grant Shapps back in July highlighting these issues. We got very short shrift from Grant Shapps, who wrote back to us in the first week of August saying, in his words, that he wouldn\u2019t be using foreign labour to solve this issue.\n\u201cNow, the government says it wants to train up \u2026 and I\u2019m absolutely in favour of training up HGV drivers, but it hasn\u2019t done that to a sufficient extent, nor has it until recently made a very small concession on being able to bring drivers in from abroad.\n\u201cSo this is a catastrophic failure of leadership, it looks like we\u2019ve ended up with petrol running out, the prime minister talking about bringing the army in.

        "content": "Filling stations should think twice before putting up fuel prices, says Petrol Retailers Association\nThe boss of the UK\u2019s Petrol Retailers Association has said he does not \u201ccondone profiteering\u201d, as petrol prices reached an eight-year high and many filling stations ran dry amid panic buying.\nBrian Madderson of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent filling stations in the UK, called on them to think twice about putting up their prices.\n\u201cThe one thing we do not condone is profiteering in situations like this,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cMost of our members, the independents, have a regular customer base and if they offend their customer base they don\u2019t deserve to have them when this crisis is over,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have got long memories and I would urge anybody who thinks about trying to make a fast buck to think again because it just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nPump prices for fuel in the UK have reached their highest level in eight years, according to figures from the RAC. They showed the average price of a litre of petrol rose from 135.9p on Friday to 136.6p on Sunday, the highest level since September 2013, as motorists scrambled to fill their vehicles.\nAs crude oil prices surged above $80 (\u00a358) a barrel, petrol prices are likely to go up further. Brent crude, the international benchmark, jumped to $80.50 a barrel on Tuesday morning \u2013 a level not seen since 2018.\nMadderson said the situation had not improved since Monday when he observed that between 50% and 90% of petrol stations had run out of fuel. \u201cDisappointingly, the messages I\u2019m getting this morning from our retailers are that panic buying does continue,\u201d he added.\nHe said one of the reasons was social media. \u201cAs soon as tanker arrives at filling station, people on social media are advising that a tanker has arrived, and then it\u2019s like bees to a honey pot. Everyone flocks there and within a few hours it\u2019s out again.\u201d\nHe said the big oil companies \u2013 Shell, BP and ExxonMobil\u2019s Esso \u2013 were hopeful that a more normal service could be achieved within three to four days, \u201cprovided the panic buying ceases\u201d.\nThe government has drawn up a national emergency plan under which half of all petrol stations would become DFSs \u2013 designated fuel stations \u2013 for emergency workers. Madderson said the definition of who is an emergency worker and what credentials they would need to show still had to be worked out. \u201cIt\u2019s a last resort situation and hopefully we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said.\nBoris Johnson has ordered the army to remain on standby to help fuel reach petrol stations hit by panic buying.\nTom Pugh, a UK economist at RSM, formerly known as Baker Tilly, warned the fuel shortages could damage the UK\u2019s economic growth if they extend beyond this week.",

        "content": "There has been a chronic mistreatment of workers in the country\u2019s meat industry, according to unions\nRead more: exploitation of meat plant workers rife across UK and Europe\nIn spring 2018, Alina Serbenco\u2019s husband, Vasile, sat in a fast-food outlet in Dublin and plugged his mobile phone into a socket to recharge. It had been only a few months since he had moved from Romania to take up a job in a car wash, but he was being paid less than half the minimum wage and could not send money home to Alina and their two children. Homeless and living in a car, Vasile urgently needed a new job.\nAs he scrolled through Facebook, he spotted an advert for a job in a meat factory. It was posted by Irish employment agency AA Euro, a specialist recruitment consultancy working with companies in the agricultural, food processing, construction and mining industries, which has offices across the EU, including in Romania, Poland and the Netherlands. The job offer was up to 70 hours a week of work for just over the minimum wage and a room in a house for about \u20ac60 (\u00a351.50) a week. Vasile decided to apply.\nHe secured the job at the meat factory and told Alina she could also get a position there. Alina and their children moved over within months, looking forward to a new life together in Ireland. But their situation quickly became complicated.\nAlina and Vasile\u2019s agency contracts were in Romanian and Polish. What they say they did not realise, says Alina, was that by signing the contract they became self-employed contractors in Poland and would be paid through the Polish revenue via a Polish subsidiary of the agency. Neither of them had even visited Poland. As a result, they could not pay tax or social insurance contributions in Ireland and had no right to social welfare, illness payments, child benefit or medical cards. As EU citizens, they suddenly felt like undocumented migrants. \u201cWe were invisible,\u201d says Alina. \u201cWe were not existing in Ireland.\u201d\nAlina says her work in the factory involved packing up to 20,000 chicken breasts a day, destined for sale in supermarkets and the food service sector across Ireland and Northern Ireland. \u201cI sat all day weighing the chicken, then put a plastic seal on them. I had to stay in the same place for five hours, head down. It\u2019s a cold place, and I was very often sick with kidney infections,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I was on my period, I would have to argue with the supervisor to go to the toilet.\u201d\n  The directors of AA Euro say the company had no control over factory conditions and \u201cno worker worked on average more than 42 hours a week on an average basis in the factory\u201d. They say AA Euro Recruitment Poland Sp. Zoo, a Polish company, sourced and contracted workers to work in Europe, but had ceased providing workers to Ireland in 2019. \u201cThese workers were being paid more than if they were contracted locally,\u201d they say. \u201cThe option of an employment contract was outside AA Euro Recruitment Poland Sp. Zoo\u2019s authority, it could only be sanctioned by the factory.\u201d\nApproximately 15,000 people work in Ireland\u2019s large-scale abattoirs and processing plants, and an estimated 70% are migrants. They\u2019re servicing Ireland\u2019s \u20ac4bn export-driven meat and livestock industry, with nearly half of all beef, and 70% of poultry, ending up in the UK.\nThe exact extent of outsourced labour in the industry is unclear. The Irish labour inspectorate, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), says it has no data in relation to the number of meat workers hired by agencies and sub-contractors. According to the meat processors representative group, Meat Industry Ireland (MII), the business model of the meat processors is based on full-time direct employment, and agencies and subcontractors provide \u201cless than 2%\u201d of its members\u2019 workforce. \u201cClaims of a high dependency on agency workers or sub-contractors are inaccurate,\u201d says Cormac Healy, the group\u2019s senior director.\nBut Greg Ennis of the Siptu union, which represents 6,500 meat workers, says a fifth of workers are hired via agencies and subcontractors.\nThe Irish labour inspectorate, which has 53 inspectors, told the Guardian that the meat processing sector is considered a \u201crisk sector\u201d due to non-compliance with employment law. Between 2015 and 2020, nearly half of all inspections in meat plants detected breaches of labour law relating to pay, working time, inadequate record-keeping and employment permit issues. The inspectorate is also responsible for regulating employment agencies; in the past two years, 1.3% of all agencies were inspected and of these, 40% were non-compliant with wage law.\nIt comes a year after a parliamentary committee examined the state\u2019s response to Covid-19. Since the start of the pandemic, Ireland\u2019s Department of Health says there have been 126 outbreaks in meat factories and just over 3,600 workers have been infected. Union officials told the committee that they believed there had been a \u201cchronic mistreatment of workers\u201d \u2013 an allegation strongly denied by MII, which said it was \u201cbaseless\u201d. Unions have demanded better enforcement and regulation of agency employment.\nThe committee recommended the establishment of an inquiry to examine the operations of the meat industry and the use of agents to procure workers. But no action has been taken. The committee\u2019s chair, politician Michael McNamara, says the government\u2019s failure to act is \u201ca disappointment\u201d.\nThe Guardian has spoken to other workers who say AA Euro assigned them as self-employed contractors in Poland. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they opened this company for me because I have never been to Poland,\u201d says a worker, who earned \u20ac10.10 (\u00a38.67) an hour. \u201cThey told me \u2018if you want to work with us, sign here. If not, there is the door \u2013 you can go home.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThis is how you have total control over your workforce,\u201d says Nora Labo, who worked for the Independent Workers Union (IWU) until earlier this year. \u201cIt is a way to avoid all the checks and balances imposed by Irish labour law.\u201d Labo says that by declaring workers as self-employed, agencies and meat factories can dispose of them \u201cas they please\u201d. \u201cPeople have no security at work; they don\u2019t accumulate any length of service in the job. They have no tenancy agreements for their accommodation, and evictions happen. It\u2019s very convenient that they\u2019re declared in Poland because there\u2019s no way to track them.\u201d\nAnother worker, Florin Ghituca, says after he started working at the factory in 2019, he realised his contract meant services were contracted from a Polish company to AA Euro. \u201cAfter a few months, my friend told me that we were paid through a Polish subsidiary. I said, \u2018come on, that is ridiculous, this is not possible\u2019. I did not believe it. I had an Irish bank account. How could my wages be paid in Poland? I found it out through talk on the factory floor,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew this deprived me of my rights.\u201d\nAlina says the agency deducted rent per person for accommodation in a three-bedroom house shared with a male worker. \u201cIt was nearly all of my wages \u2013 I had \u20ac70 (\u00a360) left the first month. I was crying in the changing rooms.\u201d She says her paperwork also shows the agency deducted \u20ac30 (\u00a327.75) a month for bank transfers and about \u20ac250 (\u00a3214.50) for Polish tax.\nBecause all her taxes and social security payments were paid through Poland, Alina could not claim financial support from Irish authorities for her children, such as a subsidy for her son\u2019s school bus, and she struggled to afford food. \u201cI was borrowing money for milk. My son\u2019s teacher gave me a \u20ac200 voucher for the supermarket \u2013 she knew we had nothing to eat.\u201d\nAlina says she repeatedly asked the agency for an Irish employment contract, but it wasn\u2019t forthcoming. \u201cIt was like a game of ping pong \u2013 the agency sent me to the factory bosses, who sent me to talk to the agency.\u201d A few months later, she decided to quit. She says the factory promised her an Irish contract, \u201cbut the day before it was due, they said I wouldn\u2019t get it for another few months. I took off my work clothes and left the job, there and then.\u201d\nAlina kept her correspondence, messages and paperwork and made a complaint to the WRC. She also sought advice from the IWU in Cork, which filed 400 complaints on behalf of 100 agency meat workers from Romania, Moldova, Slovakia and Poland, who alleged discrimination over their rights.\nCommenting on these allegations, the directors of AA Euro say the WRC cases were \u201cincorrect, vexatious and without grounds\u201d. They say the company provides accommodation for new workers unable to find places to live at the start of their employment. \u201cThey are given every opportunity to move to their own accommodation as we operate on a cost-only recovery basis and it is not the mainstay of our business,\u201d they say. \u201cNo evictions of workers have taken place.\u201d\nGhituca turned to social media to make his voice heard. He posted on the social media promotional page of a retailer selling poultry products from the factory, and expressed his feelings about life as an agency meat worker. When the agency found out about the posts, it conducted an investigation, and Ghituca was suspended for six weeks. He was then summarily dismissed by the agency for gross misconduct.\nGhituca is back in Romania, while Alina and Vasile work together as cleaners in Cork. Alina says she will never work in a meat factory again. \u201cThere are other sectors where you can get better pay for work with better conditions, where you are more respected, where you are allowed to go to the toilet, you have a day off if you need, and you have sick pay,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only thing they care about is the meat. They don\u2019t care about the people.\u201d\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

Witnesses at the trial said Kelly had forced them to obey perverse and brutal whims when they were underage.\nJerhonda Pace, one of the six main accusers in the trial, was the first to testify about the relationship she had with Kelly when she was 16. She said Kelly physically abused her multiple times for breaking his \u201crules\u201d, including not acknowledging him when he entered a room. \u201cThat\u2019s when he slapped me and he choked me until I passed out,\u201d Pace said. \u201cWhen I woke up, I was on the floor.\u201d\nGloria Allred, a lawyer for some of Kelly\u2019s victims, said that of all the predators she had gone after \u2013 including Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 \u201cMr Kelly is the worst\u201d.\nKitti Jones, a former girlfriend of Kelly who separated from him in 2013, said on Tuesday she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d at the amount of evidence. \u201cI kept my time with him and some of the abuse a secret from family and friends, so I wasn\u2019t aware of the long line of other people that had experienced similar things,\u201d she told GMB. \u201cJust to hear how he had evolved over time \u2026 hearing new stories \u2026 it really did disgust me.\u201d\nJones encouraged women with similar experiences to speak up. \u201cThere\u2019s not an expiration date on when a person should come forward. All truths deserve a platform. Create your own if you don\u2019t have one. If it takes you a year, a week, 10 years, as long as it\u2019s your truth, no matter when you\u2019re ready to tell it, tell it.\u201d\nKelly\u2019s conviction has been hailed as an \u201cimportant moment for accountability\u201d in the #MeToo movement by the New York attorney general, Letitia James.\nOronike Odeleye, co-founder of the #MuteRKelly campaign, told the New York Times the verdict was the \u201cculmination of the movement of so many women who having being trying so long to have their voices heard\u201d.\nKelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, faces up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for 4 May.\n Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

        "content": "For character comics such as Zach Zucker, Bilal Zafar and Jay Bennett, performing as other people is a way to both escape from \u2013 and confront \u2013 their personal lives\nAfter an eventful 18 months away, Zach Zucker is back on a London stage, and making a mess of it. His hapless standup alter ego, Jack Tucker, dances into this trendy Dalston bar in an intriguingly damp suit, then stumbles, plummets and catapults his pint across the room quite spectacularly.\nIt\u2019s a perfectly executed bit of business, but few tonight will be thinking: \u201cNow there\u2019s a man to entrust with lots of vital, fragile kit.\u201d And yet that happened, last summer, on his return to Los Angeles. A professional clown helped run one of the highest-profile vaccination centres in the world.\n\u201cI was like the head of training and recruiting for this entire operation at Dodger Stadium,\u201d says the proud, still slightly incredulous comedian. New colleagues were sceptical, but years of performing and promoting proved surprisingly transferrable skills: \u201cThe CEO, and Sean and the mayor, told me I created the culture onsite,\u201d he says. \u201cBringing lightness to extremely heavy stuff.\u201d Sean is the actor Sean Penn, co-founder of CORE, the non-profit behind it. This capable clown arranged food donations, vehicles and major concerts, too.\nNow though, with that high-status mission complete, Zucker is back wearing Tucker\u2019s sweaty suit. Which raises an interesting question for such offbeat character acts: what compels you to play these idiots?\nZucker \u2013 trained by Philippe Gaulier in France, and now also a clown teacher \u2013 is defiantly leftfield, and Tucker actively divides audiences. Initially created to parody lazy standups, he\u2019s become more than just a boorish, boozy hack. Zucker\u2019s hang-ups have seeped in too. \u201cMy buddy said that Jack Tucker is the perfect character for me, because it drains all of my bad habits to make me look like a genius,\u201d he says. \u201cThe similarities: that fear of \u2018am I just bad?\u2019 That desperation. There\u2019s a part of me that feels the sadness that Tucker has. He\u2019s a sweet guy. He just desperately loves to perform.\u201d\nPerhaps Zucker represents all live entertainers, post-lockdown? \u201cHe\u2019ll never quit, and I\u2019ll never quit. There\u2019s nothing that will make me stop performing. No matter how many people stop coming.\u201d\nMade-up characters can be oddly inspirational. Jay Bennett\u2019s jobbing 1980s singer, Yasmine Day, has a similar origin to Tucker: both began as silly solo experiments when double-act partners were busy. While Bennett admits to fearing onstage embarrassment, the indefatigable Day is pure budget showbiz, and her talc-puffing entrance is particularly splendid. It may be in the blood.\n\u201cMy mum was a Benny Hill dancer,\u201d Bennett reveals. \u201cA Hill\u2019s Angel. I grew up watching this weird background stuff, the smoke machines. So I really liked the idea of putting on a really big show, but with such limits.\u201d\nDay initially covered 80s classics \u2013 Toto\u2019s Africa, with just the vowels \u2013 but now belts out Bennett originals. Singing was the original plan, and there\u2019s a deeper message here, \u201chow older women in the entertainment industry slowly become irrelevant. I do think there\u2019s an innate fear in myself, that once I get older the industry won\u2019t acknowledge me. Yasmine doesn\u2019t care and keeps going.\u201d\nDoes she envy Day\u2019s mentality? \u201cI think you do have to be slightly delusional, in quite a tough industry. I definitely feel more confident after I\u2019ve played her. To do such ridiculous things on stage, it does make me think in my day-to-day life I can just tackle anything.\u201d\nThat character could potentially grace big stages, but others prefer niche corners. Currently prepping a decade-celebrating show at the Soho theatre is Paul Vickers\u2019 oddball puppet master, Mr Twonkey. Vickers previously fronted John Peel favourites Dawn of the Replicants, but now airs his inventive songs and soundscapes via absurdist comedy. Which sometimes feels like a high-wire act.\n\u201cI\u2019m a vulnerable man, my show involves a big leap of faith, as it\u2019s like believing in a fairytale,\u201d Vickers admits. \u201cThose that go with me enjoy the ride; get something out it. Those that don\u2019t try and attack me, or Chris Hutchinson.\u201d\nHutchinson is Vickers\u2019 puppet lion, and onstage foil. At one bus-based family show \u201cI asked \u2018what shall we do with Chris?\u2019 And a young boy shouted out \u2018Burn him!\u2019 And that started a chain reaction of the whole bus chanting \u2018Burn him! Burn him!\u2019\u201d\nIt can be painful, but Twonkey prevails, and you sense that Vickers would be lost without him. \u201cIt\u2019s important to play, even as an adult,\u201d he concurs.\nYou can overdo it, particularly when online streaming. Last year Bilal Zafar enjoyed unexpected lockdown success as the fictional \u201cgaffer\u201d of a video-game football team, PES United. But spending hundreds of hours in character, as live gigs also returned, recently forced an overdue break. \u201cI woke up one morning, like, \u2018I can\u2019t do anything,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cMy brain stopped working.\u201d\nUsually, getting to be someone else for hours \u201creally cheers me up\u201d, he says. Zafar has even made a whole PES United film, with a tour planned soon, but he\u2019ll not play the gaffer live, yet. As a standup, he never envisioned doing characters \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t have the confidence\u201d \u2013 but as these lockdown streams progressed, PES United\u2019s personnel developed personalities. Which allows for some low-key satire.\n\u201cMy guy, he\u2019s definitely a Brexiteer, but doesn\u2019t really know why,\u201d says Zafar, who cites the faux-furious US comic Tim Heidecker as one influence. Both often tweet in character, which could cause confusion, but tone is everything. Early on, Zafar\u2019s stream attracted a \u201claddish-type crowd, saying inappropriate jokes,\u201d he admits. \u201cThey\u2019ve all gone as it got more surreal.\u201d\nThese varied creations can also deal with more personal matters. Jack Tucker\u2019s hectic shows regularly pause for poignant interludes about how comedy caused issues back home, \u201csomething that also rings true for me\u201d, Zucker admits.Tackling family dramas head-on, meanwhile, is Sooz Kempner, via some innovative character interactions. One live show featured the comic Skyping her teenage self; another framed Kempner as \u201ca deluded loser\u201d, then introduced a significant guest in an almost Shakespearean twist.\n\u201cI arrived as a version of my dad,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d already talked about him in a previous show \u2013 I cut ties with him in 2011 \u2013 and it was sort of an Easter egg for people who\u2019d seen that; and a character-based explanation for some of my insecurities.\u201d\nIronically, Kempner and that character then bonded. He developed into Malcolm, \u201can anti-woke clueless recently divorced man who believes he\u2019s a big online superstar,\u201d she explains. Kempner also grew a healthy lockdown audience online, and now does \u201ctwo-hour-plus streams as him on Twitch\u201d. To much bigger crowds than that live show. But how does her real mother find Malcolm? \u201cExcruciating,\u201d she says, \u201cand hilarious.\u201d\nCharacters can evolve, or become awkward. Zucker plans to shelve Jack Tucker soon, before the alter ego completely takes over his live shows \u201cand it terrifies me to be myself, again\u201d. But he\u2019ll return. \u201cI would love to do Tucker at 70 years old,\u201d muses the comic. \u201cI\u2019d be so curious to see what that show is like.\u201d Fewer spectacular pratfalls, presumably.",

        "content": "England World Cup winner scored 285 goals for the Anfield club and became known as \u2018Sir Roger\u2019 among Liverpool supporters\nBuckingham Palace never bestowed a knighthood on Roger Hunt for services to England\u2019s finest moment but he could cherish the honour regardless. \u201cI never needed it\u201d was his take on whether the 1966 World Cup winners should all have been knighted. \u201cI was knighted by the Kop. That means more.\u201d\nHunt, who has died at the age of 83, will for ever be known as \u201cSir Roger\u201d to the generation of Liverpool fans who experienced the club\u2019s lasting transformation under Bill Shankly. And to many more who followed \u2013 including J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who wrote to Hunt on his 80th birthday in 2018 expressing admiration and gratitude for what the legendary forward achieved in a Liverpool shirt. It is an extensive list featuring the Second Division championship, two First Division titles, the FA Cup and the considerable feat of remaining the club\u2019s leading goalscorer for eight consecutive seasons.\nIn many respects the man from Glazebury, Cheshire, encapsulated both Liverpool\u2019s rise and the influence of the manager who made it all happen. Even now, decades on and a procession of trophies and world-class talents later, no one has scored more league goals for Liverpool than Hunt. He scored 245 times in the league, 285 goals in 492 appearances for the club in total and, while Ian Rush may have overtaken his all-time goalscoring record, Hunt\u2019s elevated place in Anfield folklore is secure. As it is in the annals of English football history.\nIt was Hunt\u2019s instinctive celebration, it has been suggested, that swayed the Azerbaijani linesman Tofiq Bahramov into awarding Geoff Hurst\u2019s controversial second goal against West Germany at Wembley in the final. Hunt was the closest England player to the ball when it crashed down off the crossbar. He threw his arms aloft rather than attempt to convert the rebound and always maintained it had crossed the line.\nNot up for debate, but often overlooked, was the extensive contribution the Liverpool striker made to the entire World Cup campaign. Hunt was the only England forward to start all six matches for Alf Ramsey\u2019s side in the summer of 1966. His three goals in the group stage \u2013 one against Mexico and both in the 2-0 defeat of France \u2013 were crucial to their advance. He started the tournament alongside Jimmy Greaves, whose injury against France opened the door for Hurst, and the only debate on the morning of the final was whether the impending hat-trick hero would retain his place at Greaves\u2019s expense.\nRamsey, like Shankly, recognised Hunt\u2019s fundamental importance to his team. It was a mark of the striker\u2019s intelligence \u2013 on top of his tireless work rate and ruthless quality in front of goal \u2013 that he adapted to different styles under two intensely demanding managers. At Liverpool he prospered from width, supplied by Ian Callaghan and Peter Thompson, but he was equally productive for Ramsey\u2019s \u201cwingless wonders\u201d. He scored 18 goals in 34 appearances for his country over a seven-year international career. That era would produce lasting friendships. Hunt, a modest and reserved character, remained close to Martin Peters and Norman Hunter among others.\nIt was Shankly, naturally, who had the greatest impact on Hunt\u2019s career. The forward remained indebted for a vital show of faith upon the legendary manager\u2019s arrival at Anfield, along with the success and the relationship that followed.\nDespite achieving so much in a defining period for club and country, Hunt came late to the professional game. He was 20 when he signed for Phil Taylor\u2019s Liverpool, having completed national service in Aldershot before joining Stockton Heath in the Cheshire League. He signed as a potential replacement for Billy Liddell as the Liverpool great neared the end of his career, and scored on his debut against Scunthorpe in September 1959. But by his own admission playing regularly for the army and in the Cheshire League was no preparation for the rigours of the professional game.\nThe Liverpool dressing room was sceptical of the newcomer\u2019s ability at first. Shankly, however, who had replaced Taylor within months of Hunt\u2019s debut, spotted something in the finisher\u2019s game. Hunt was one of the few players to survive the cull. In a team bolstered by the signings of Ron Yeats and Ian St John the striker repaid Shankly with 41 goals in 41 games as Liverpool ended eight seasons in the Second Division with promotion as champions in 1962.\nTop-flight titles followed in 1964 and 1966, sandwiching the 1965 FA Cup success. Hunt scored the opening goal in the 2-1 final win against Leeds that brought Liverpool their long-awaited first triumph in the competition. On the opening day of that 1964-65 season he also scored the first goal to be shown on Match of the Day in a 3-2 win against Arsenal.\nThe World Cup polished a glorious era for Hunt. It is captured in a memorable picture of the Liverpool striker and an England teammate, Everton\u2019s Ray Wilson, parading the Jules Rimet trophy around Goodison Park before the 1966 Charity Shield.\nAfter 11 years at Anfield Hunt was sold to Bolton for \u00a332,000, where he scored 25 goals in 84 appearances. The drop to the Second Division was softened by the fact Wanderers were the team he supported as a boy and managed by Nat Lofthouse, his boyhood idol. His Anfield testimonial in 1972, the year he retired, attracted a crowd of 56,000 with thousands more reportedly locked outside.\nHunt worked for the pools panel for more than 30 years after his career ended \u2013 management, he insisted, never appealed \u2013 and had a road haulage business. The honours system belatedly recognised his achievements with an MBE in 2000. Liverpool recognised the importance and status of \u201cSir Roger\u201d long before.",

You understand.\u201d\nGrisham makes the claim in a new book, I\u2019ll Take Your Questions Now, which will be published next week. The Washington Post obtained a copy.\nTrump\u2019s presidency was dogged by his relationship with Putin, the focus of the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.\nMueller did not establish a conspiracy but stressed that he did not exonerate Trump of seeking to obstruct justice. Speculation over the two leaders\u2019 relationship remained rampant, particularly over a meeting alone save for interpreters in Helsinki in 2018.\nIn front of the media at the G20 summit in Osaka in 2019, with Grisham sitting nearby, Trump joked with Putin that they should both \u201cget rid\u201d of journalists who published \u201cfake news\u201d, saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t have this problem in Russia.\u201d\nPutin said: \u201cYes, yes, we have too, the same.\u201d\nTrump later smirked, pointed at Putin and said: \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election.\u201d\nGrisham was Trump\u2019s third press secretary, an unhappy reign in which she did not hold a single White House briefing. Her book has been extensively trailed, titbits including a comparison of Melania Trump to Marie Antoinette.\nA spokeswoman for Donald Trump has called the book \u201canother pitiful attempt to cash in on the president\u2019s strength and sell lies about the Trump family\u201d.\nMelania Trump has also dismissed the book. Grisham was working for the first lady when she resigned on 6 January this year, the day of the deadly attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.\nAccording to the Post, Grisham says Donald Trump \u201cwas too wrapped up in his own ego and his own delusions about his invincibility\u201d to deal properly with the coronavirus pandemic.\nDiscussing notorious events including \u201cSharpiegate\u201d, involving a crudely doctored hurricane map, and the porn star Stormy Daniels\u2019 claim that Trump\u2019s penis was small and shaped like a mushroom, Grisham writes about White House incompetence extending to how staff lied to Trump to stop him losing his temper.\nOne such instance, Grisham says, came in 2018, when Air Force One was customarily made available to carry the casket and service dog of former president George HW Bush, the deceased patriarch of a family Trump loathed.\n\u201cWe knew he wouldn\u2019t be OK with that, even for a brief trip,\u201d Grisham writes. \u201cDead bodies, death, sickness \u2013 those things really seemed to creep him out.\u201d\nGrisham is heavily critical of Melania Trump, who she says began to break with her husband over the Stormy Daniels affair.\nWriting about how Melania was criticised for not standing with her husband on election night, as Jill Biden did with Joe Biden, Grisham says Melania said: \u201cI don\u2019t stand next to him because I don\u2019t need to hold him up like she does.

        "content": "Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and Siraj reveal how refugees are pressured for cash\nEarly this year, Yousef, a 32-year-old Syrian living in Sweden, found himself faced with an impossible choice: either enlist in the army of the government that made him a refugee, or risk his family losing their home back in Syria.\nMilitary service is mandatory for Syrian men between the ages of 18 and 42, and the stakes rose significantly in February when an army official announced on Facebook that a new regulation would allow authorities to confiscate the property of \u201cservice evaders\u201d and their families. Pressure was mounting on Yousef to decide.\nAnd so, in June, he made his way to the Syrian embassy in Stockholm with $8,000 (\u00a35,876) in cash, ready to pay the fee to have his name taken off the conscription rolls. A shiver ran down his spine as he collected his receipt.\n\u201cThis money will be used by the Syrian regime to buy weapons and kill more people,\u201d Yousef told the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), his voice trembling.\nHe is far from alone. About a fifth of Syria\u2019s population of 17 million are men of military age, according to data from the World Bank, and studies have shown that the threat of conscription is a major reason many refugees fear returning.\nThe Syrian government has been able to leverage this anxiety into revenue, harvesting foreign currency from the roughly 1 million Syrians who have settled in Europe to help prop up its ailing budget after US sanctions cut the country off from the international banking system last year.\nSyrian embassies, which used to only process paperwork for the military exemptions, have recently begun collecting cash payments. Two researchers, an airport official, and a former diplomat interviewed by OCCRP and the Syrian Investigative Reporting Unit (Siraj), said they suspected the cash made its way back to Syria via diplomatic pouch. Such a move would violate the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which says \u201cpackages constituting the diplomatic bag [\u2026] may contain only diplomatic documents or articles intended for official use.\u201d\nGovernment documents and official statements show Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government projected the policy would raise substantial income, revealing the lengths the Syrian government is going to in order to raise cash. Syria\u2019s army, finance ministry, foreign ministry, central bank, and military recruitment service did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe US sanctions implemented in 2020 under the Caesar Act have worsened an already difficult financial situation for Syria. Processing payments for vital imports such as wheat and oil products have become even harder as a result, and the Syrian pound, now worth barely 1% of its pre-crisis value against the dollar, has suffered further losses.\n\u201cShortage in foreign currency has become an acute problem, especially after the Caesar Act came into force,\u201d said Armenak Tokmajyan, a researcher at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. \u201cThe regime needs foreign currency. The more it has, the longer it will survive.\u201d\nThe government has leaned increasingly on its diaspora to fill its coffers. A Syrian passport is now one of the world\u2019s most expensive to obtain abroad, at about \u00a3220 for a new passport, and about \u00a3600 to get it expedited.\nSyria\u2019s 2021 budget projection predicts revenues from the military exemption fees to reach 240bn Syrian pounds (\u00a3140m), up from 70bn Syrian pounds in 2020, according to copies published in Syria\u2019s Official Gazette.\nThe estimated revenue makes up 3.2% of this year\u2019s budget revenue, up from 1.75% in 2020, the Syrian economist Karam Shaar told OCCRP.\nSweden illustrates how the new amendments have played out among Syria\u2019s diaspora. The Scandinavian country hosts about 114,000 Syrian refugees and is home to tens of thousands of relatively new arrivals.\nBetween June and August, OCCRP reporters made three visits to the Syrian embassy in Stockholm. They counted an average of 10 applicants a day waiting in the queue for military service exemption.\nAnother hint of how many people were paying the exemption fees came a year earlier, in June 2020, when the embassy website published the names of 43 Syrians cleared to pay the fee. It is unclear exactly when those on the list applied, but for other procedures, such as passport issuance, the embassy usually issues its lists once a month. The June post was the last such public announcement.\nAn embassy employee, speaking to an undercover OCCRP reporter, said he could not say exactly how many had applied for the service exemption, but that there had been a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in the first half of 2021, which he attributed to the February announcement.\n\u201cOn some days, 10 come to us and on other days the figure can go up to 50,\u201d the employee said. If accurate, this would mean the embassy could be taking in as much as $400,000 in cash on some days.\nOCCRP spoke with 10 Syrians, eight in Sweden, one in Germany, and one in Lebanon, who decided to pay the conscription fee. Some, like Yousef, were frightened by the prospect of asset seizures in Syria. But others had more practical reasons.\nOne 29-year-old named Ali said he paid the fee at the encouragement of his family, who considered the payment to be \u201ca form of direct participation in the Syrian war effort\u201d.\nGian, a Syrian who works at a home for elderly people in Frankfurt, Germany, said he had no issue in paying the money. \u201cI am getting a monthly salary, the exemption process is easy, and I want to safeguard my family\u2019s property in Syria from being seized,\u201d Gian said. He said three relatives with asylum status in Germany also paid the fee.\nBut many Syrians are still leery of funding the government they feel was responsible for sending them into exile.\nAbdullah Jaafar, a 35-year-old who has been living in Gothenburg, Sweden\u2019s second-largest city, for eight years, said he saw the exemption payments as a kind of extortion.\n\u201cI have the full amount, and I can pay it, but I will not do it,\u201d Jaafar said. \u201cThis government is illegal.\u201d\nAli Al Ibrahim reports for Siraj.

It is written for the screen by the German novelist and dramatist Daniel Kehlmann and directed by its lead actor, Daniel Br\u00fchl, who features as an ironised version of himself, a self-involved movie star who is living the dream in a gorgeous modern apartment in Berlin with his partner and two young children.\nOne morning, Br\u00fchl, or \u201cBr\u00fchl\u201d, is heading off to London to do a casting session for a superhero movie which, though undoubtedly absurd, will clearly be very lucrative. But he realises he has set off too early, so he dismisses his driver and whiles away a few hours in a near-deserted pub, where a grumpy local, Bruno (Peter Kurth), happens to be slumped at the bar. Striking up conversation, Bruno disquietingly reveals that he knows a great deal about Br\u00fchl. He lambasts him about what he sees as the specious and naive quality of his breakthrough movie, Good Bye Lenin! from 2003, the one where Br\u00fchl plays a young guy whose earnestly communist East Berliner mother awakens from a coma not realising the wall has fallen, and her son has to protect her from the truth. That, jeers Bruno, is pure Wessi Romantik \u2013 West Berliner romanticism. (Is this Kehlmann speaking, actually?) Then he reveals that Br\u00fchl\u2019s luxurious flat once belonged to his father, who was more or less evicted by an unscrupulous gentrifying developer, and furthermore makes it clear that he knows a great deal more about Br\u00fchl\u2019s personal life because he is his neighbour in the grimly undeveloped block just over the way.\nTo some extent, this film is about the geopolitical implications of the gentrification that Berlin has experienced since 1989; it\u2019s about the Berlin Wall of inequality that separates rich and poor. It\u2019s also about celebrity and acting. (There\u2019s a witty touch about how very good Br\u00fchl is at the mysterious actorly art of crying real tears.) The film skates over these ideas and lines of stagey dialogue rattle back and forth. It\u2019s not a vanity project (Br\u00fchl does not seem in the least vain) but an actor\u2019s project, nonetheless.\n Next Door is released on 1 October in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",

Browne does not name the UK, but some supporters of Scotland are convinced that the UK is championing the announced candidacy of the Kenyan defence minister, Monica Juma. The UK foreign and Commonwealth secretary, Liz Truss, met Kenya\u2019s foreign minister at the UN general assembly to discuss Juma\u2019s bid to run the 54-member Commonwealth.\nJuma is offering herself as a consensus-building candidate, but privately some Commonwealth leaders have said the efforts to oust Scotland \u201crisk breaking the Commonwealth apart region by region. They have stirred up more than they can handle\u201d.\nThe Commonwealth, still a symbol of post-imperial cooperation and much cherished by the royal family, has normally tried to operate through consensus. Stories have appeared in the British media accusing Scotland, a Labour peer and attorney general in the government led by Gordon Brown, of lavish spending, arrogance or mismanagement of staff.\nSo far, the auditing process has not confirmed any irregularities, and some of the controversial spending was inherited from her predecessor. Her allies claim the Conservative party dislike her independence, and would prefer to see the Commonwealth as more closely aligned with the \u201cglobal Britain\u201d approach.\nSince 1993, secretary generals can serve a maximum two terms, and there has been an expectation that someone seeking a second term will be reappointed.\nBut by writing to fellow Commonwealth heads, Browne, the prime minister of Antigua, is clearly trying to rally support for Scotland against what the Caribbean countries see as an improper attempt to oust her. Scotland herself was born in Dominica.\nBrowne writes: \u201cOur Commonwealth family has until now held to the tradition of at least two terms for a secretary-general and to the principle of rotation between regions. It now appears the separate regions of Africa, Asia and the Pacific have been, or are being encouraged to present candidates in opposition to the current secretary-general. This runs counter to the principle of rotation which would see Africa assuming the office of secretary-general in 2024 when the Caribbean\u2019s turn would come to an end followed in turn by the Pacific.\u201d\nHe urges: \u201cIf we are to live up the values of the Commonwealth which we cherish and hold dear we should eschew any attempt to pit our countries and our regions one against the other. Only in that way can the Commonwealth continue to be a beacon in this world which is beset by turmoil.\n\u201cEvents we have faced in recent years show we cannot afford for this Commonwealth to be divided. We must be united against the common threat of Covid, climate change and economic fallout which will scar all our countries for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nLady Scotland has had her position renewed twice on an annual basis amid the postponement of the Commonwealth Summit at which an election would normally take place.\nBut since Juma emerged in August as a candidate, the Kenyan politician has started lobbying ahead of the next summit, which will probably be held next year.\nThere has also been talk of holding the election on the sidelines of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November. It remains to be seen whether the African nations will fall in bloc behind Juma, but lobbying for her has already begun across Africa and Asia.\nIf Scotland served two terms, she would retire in March 2024.\nBrowne argues that \u201cnow is a time for consistency, stability and a proven track record of delivery\u201d.",

        "content": "The Berejiklian government commitment is backed by Liberals and Nationals in state cabinet while their federal counterparts remain split\nScott Morrison faces escalating pressure to set a more ambitious national climate target for 2030 after the New South Wales Coalition state government promised to cut the state\u2019s emissions in half this decade.\nThe commitment by Australia\u2019s largest state is backed by Liberals and Nationals in cabinet while their federal counterparts remain publicly split on climate policy.\nThe new target lifts its 2030 emissions reduction target from 35% to 50% compared with 2005 levels.\nIn a pointed contrast with the language used by some federal MPs, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said increasing the target showed the state was \u201cserious about setting itself up for the future and helping the world decarbonise\u201d. John Barilaro, the Nationals leader and deputy premier, said it would be good for regional communities, which would reap the rewards of new clean industries.\nThey said updated projections to be released on Wednesday suggested the state could attract $37bn in private investment while meeting the goal. \u201cThis is about putting the policies in place to give industry and investors certainty, not only to protect our planet but to future-proof our prosperity and way of life,\u201d Berejiklian said.\nThe state commitment will add to the domestic and international pressure on Morrison to set a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and significantly increase Australia\u2019s short-term goal before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. The existing 2030 target \u2013 a 26-28% cut \u2013 was set six years ago, and has been widely criticised as not consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement.\nIn an interview with Guardian Australia, the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd predicted the Morrison government would be forced to change direction and nearly double Australia\u2019s emissions target for 2030 to avoid international isolation.\nRudd said he believed Morrison had begun a \u201cmassive crabwalk\u201d on climate, pointing to the prime minister\u2019s shift to saying Australia would reach net zero \u201cpreferably\u201d by 2050 and reportedly discussing with News Corp some of its newspapers backing that target before Cop26.\nHe said he believed the next step would be the government increasing its 2030 emissions reduction target to \u201cabout 50%\u201d. \u201cHe knows that if he doesn\u2019t do that, he\u2019s going to be left completely internationally isolated by everybody,\u201d Rudd said, citing what he called \u201cthe real risk\u201d of the European Union imposing a carbon tariff on Australian exports.\n\u201cAnything less than a target to halve emissions by 2030 risks the Great Barrier Reef disappearing and won\u2019t be seen as credible by the international community. That\u2019s what the independent Climate Change Authority said is our fair share of the global effort to tackle the climate crisis. And that\u2019s what the Americans are doing.\u201d\nRudd said a net zero commitment that deferred \u201cthe heavy lifting\u201d until after 2030 \u201cwon\u2019t be worth the paper it is written on\u201d.\nIn recognition of growing concern about climate policy on the Liberal backbench, Morrison met on Tuesday with moderate MPs concerned the government may not set a 2050 net zero target to appease opponents in the National party. He told the group he hoped to release a roadmap explaining how the country could meet net zero emissions and to formally adopt a 2050 target, but he had not yet reached agreement with the Nationals.\nBarilaro said the Nationals supported the new 2030 state target because regional NSW was \u201chome to the skills, infrastructure and resources needed\u201d as demand for low emissions technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, grew. \u201cWe will continue to take action in a way that delivers more jobs and more investment for people in the city and in the bush,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nNSW\u2019s push to meet the target will be underpinned by clean energy legislation passed with multi-party support last year.\nMatt Kean, the NSW energy and environment minister and a regular critic of the Morrison government on climate, said peer-reviewed modelling found the state\u2019s emissions were projected to fall between 47% and 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nKean said as global demand for low carbon products and investments grew the state\u2019s fortunes would be increasingly \u201ctied to the fortunes of our planet\u201d.\n\u201cInternational capital is looking for safe havens and trying to avoid carbon risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf [market participants] don\u2019t feel that a state or jurisdiction has the right targets and policies in place, people will not invest.\n\u201cWhen you are competing for scarce capital against Europe, against Japan, against countries that have strong targets and plans, [not acting] will come at a cost to mums and dads on their mortgages, and small business owners. The cost will flow through the whole economy.\u201d\nThe political shift came as the think tank Beyond Zero Emissions released a report that found Australia could develop green exports worth nearly triple the value of existing fossil fuel industries, but needed to act soon to avoid missing the opportunity.\nIt suggested surging global demand for zero-carbon products including green steel, renewably generated hydrogen and ammonia, green aluminium and critical minerals could be worth $333bn a year to the Australian economy by 2050.\nHeidi Lee, Beyond Zero Emissions\u2019 chief executive, said other nations would capture \u201cearly market share\u201d and Australia would be left behind if it did not invest in clean exports soon.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe report said 39% of Australia\u2019s current commodity exports were fossil fuels \u2013 mainly thermal and metallurgical coal, crude oil and liquified natural gas. The bulk of these were sold to Japan, South Korea and China, which each had net zero targets for 2050 or 2060. That suggested the value of Australia\u2019s exports would fall by $128bn a year unless it invested in alternatives.\n\u201cIn the three decades leading to 2050, the world will decarbonise,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAustralia can choose to become a green export powerhouse and re-industrialise the nation or miss our chance by not acting today.\u201d\nThe group made several recommendations for the country to capitalise on future export opportunities, including setting a $100bn national green export target for 2035, making green export investment a priority for Australian government departments and agencies, creating a $20bn \u201csupergrid deployment authority\u201d with a remit to back large-scale clean investments and launch a five-year national rollout of renewable energy industrial precincts in 14 regional areas.",

Sign up now!\nBig Cup has come a long way from the innocent purity of its early years, when clubs implicitly backed by authoritarian regimes threw money at the best players from all around the world, sometimes from teams in pirate leagues with names like Millonarios, and made the competition its dominion. Yes, it\u2019s PSG v Manchester City on Tuesday evening, and when we say Big Cup has come a long way, we are indeed making the counterargument in a heavy-handed style. Though to be fair, there are some differences: neither team has conquered Europe like Real Madrid did back in the day, for example, and Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano was better than Lionel Messi, another position we\u2019re taking in good faith.\nIt\u2019s a big one all right. PSG have started the Ligue 1 season like a train, with eight wins out of eight, though they\u2019ve needed last-minute goals to win two of the last three, and the aforementioned Leo hasn\u2019t contributed much yet, his stats for his new club currently standing at zero goals, zero assists and one sour-faced bench-sulk. It\u2019s early days, mind you, and The Fiver isn\u2019t going too far out on a limb to suggest that he\u2019ll be opening his account sooner rather than later \u2026 and this may be as good a time as any, seeing he\u2019s got a habit of rattling them in against former boss and mentor Mr Pep. Six in four, in fact, notching a couple in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s semi-final win over Bayern in 2015, then a hat-trick when they routed City 4-0 at the Camp Nou a year later. Oh Pep! Imagine what the Blond Arrow would have done to him.\nEven so, both teams will go into this match with a little trepidation. PSG are coming off the back of a matchday-one draw in Bruges; Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Neymar have fallen out over a misplaced pass; and City made the entire team lose their minds in last season\u2019s semi to such an extent that they should have ended the second leg with eight men. On the other hand, City shipped three against Leipzig, and were recently held at home by Southampton. Apparently they were good against Chelsea at the weekend, but The Fiver was watching the golf, and exactly the same pundits lauding their performance were bigging up Tommy T\u2019s men for the title the other week, so you\u2019ll forgive us if we keep our counsel for now.

        "content": "Remarkable footage shows the pioneering neurologist at work in this excellent documentary \nTake your pick of extraordinary moments in this excellent documentary about the neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks. In 2015, aged 82, knowing he had months to live, Sacks sat down at home in New York and talked to the camera with great honesty. During his childhood in north London, he recalls his mother, a surgeon and gynaecologist, bringing home a foetus for him, aged 10 or 11, to dissect. Later, when she found out he was gay, she told him he was an abomination, that he should never have been born.\nIn his mid-20s, Sacks escaped London, his mother and homophobia for the freedom of California. There is a photo of him arriving at work on a huge motorbike, shaggy beard, puffing a cigar, looking like an extra from Easy Rider \u2013 only he\u2019s wearing a white lab coat. This was around the time he was a physician to a California chapter of the Hells Angels and had an amphetamine habit that would have killed an ordinary man. But he was a champion weight-lifter; the bulk saved his life.\nSacks wrote that the most significant moment in his life was in the late 1960s, treating victims of the 1920s encephalitis lethargica or \u201csleeping sickness\u201d epidemic. Remarkable black and white home movie footage shows patients rising like Lazarus \u2013 if only fleetingly \u2013 after decades in catatonic states. Sacks\u2019s 1973 book Awakenings, about the experience, was adapted into the Robin Williams movie. He recounts other famous case studies here, including Dr P, the brilliant music teacher with visual agnosia who mistook his wife for a hat, and gave Sacks the title for his best-known book.\nStill, for me, the standout moment of the film is Sacks at a zoo, crouched in front of a chimpanzee enclosure: face pressed against the glass, nose to nose with a chimp, mirroring its movements, twisting his lips, becoming simian. What he is doing looks like a kind of extreme empathy, feeling his way into the animal. A friend with autism describes his approach as a clinician, getting inside the heads of people with neurological differences. He debunked the stereotype that people with autism didn\u2019t have an inner life, she says \u2013 and demystified conditions like hers and Tourette syndrome.\nSacks, maybe because he knows the end is near, can be boyishly silly, too, gigglingly telling a story about sticking his willy into a bowl of jelly to cool a night-time erection. And, after being celibate for 35 years, there is a glorious happy ending to the story of his sexuality. What a man. Just writing this makes me want to watch the documentary all over again.\n Oliver Sacks: His Own Life is released on 29 September in cinemas (for one night only) and on 4 October on digital platforms.",

S\u00f6der also said on Wednesday he opposed a short-term fix \u201cfor four to six weeks\u201d.\nShould Laschet lose the inner-party battle, he would risk ending up in a powerless backbench role.\n\u201cIt is a strange alternative world that the failed candidate has assembled for himself,\u201d Der Spiegel wrote in a comment piece. \u201cPerhaps Armin Laschet needs a couple more days to fully understand. He lost. It\u2019s over.\u201d\nEllen Demuth, a CDU delegate in the Rhineland-Palatinate regional parliament, has called on Twitter for Laschet to resign, saying if he clung on to office he would cause further damage to the party.\nMeanwhile, the victorious SPD is pushing up the tempo to start coalition talks with the two kingmakers in the next coalition government, the Greens and the FDP. The ecological and pro-business parties have agreed to hold first exploratory talks on Wednesday, without either of the larger parties.\nThe Greens are likely to do this with a changed power balance inside its own party, following reports that its co-leader, Robert Habeck, would claim the role of vice-chancellor in a future coalition government, not the chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock.\nBaerbock, who won out against Habeck in the race to become the Greens\u2019 official candidate in April, oversaw her party picking up a strong gain of 5.9 percentage points on the last election, but failed to meet her own aspiration of becoming the strongest force in the country.\nHabeck on Tuesday sidestepped questions about a deal over the deputy chancellor role, which in Germany is an unofficial title that is not mentioned in the constitution. \u201cThe question of who will be vice-chancellor is irrelevant\u201d, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a chancellor.\u201d\nRecent polls suggest every second German citizen would favour the next government to be made up of a so-called \u201ctraffic-light coalition\u201d between SPD, Greens and FDP, while only a quarter preferred a CDU-led \u201cJamaica coalition\u201d.\nA continuation of the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that has governed Germany for the last eight years is unpopular, favoured by only 5% of those questioned in a survey by the pollster Civey.",

Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side followed this by beating West Ham in the Premier League, before reverses to the same team in the Carabao Cup and Aston Villa in the league.\nSolskj\u00e6r was asked about the comments of Gary Neville, a former United teammate and now Sky Sports pundit, who claimed that given the backing the Norwegian has enjoyed, United have to claim a trophy by the end of next season. In the summer Solskj\u00e6r strengthened by signing Jadon Sancho, Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\u201cThe pressure is a privilege,\u201d the manager said. \u201cTo work in this environment, you have to embrace that pressure. If he says we have to win a trophy \u2013 well, yes I\u2019ve been backed [and] the backing I have got says to me we are sticking to our plan, but we are in a results business.

Among staff, 60.9% with enduring symptoms did not have to take time off, 15.9% were absent for five days or less and 3.3% were absent from work for 61 days or more.\nThe ONS findings were based on survey responses from about 3,500 pupils and 1,600 staff. Symptoms were self-reported rather than clinically diagnosed and the ONS cautioned the data should not be taken as representative of all schools in England.\n\u201cResults should be interpreted with caution because it is not known how many people would have experienced these symptoms even if they had not been infected with Covid-19. The survey response rate of 20% also means that the findings may be subject to response bias,\u201d the report said.\nThe survey forms part of the Schools Infection Study (SIS), from Public Health England (PHE), the ONS and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who surveyed staff and students in schools in July.\nFiona Dawe, SIS deputy director, said the new data mirrored findings from previous studies which similarly showed adults more likely than younger people to report continuing symptoms. \u201cCapturing the experiences of pupils and staff post-infection will form a crucial part of the response to the pandemic as we move into autumn and winter,\u201d she said.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThese findings again reinforce the importance of the Covid vaccination programme, including 12- to 15-year-olds, in helping to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in schools and colleges.\u201d",

Its executive director, Gordon Balmer, said that as of Tuesday, 37% of its roughly 5,500 members had reported being out of fuel \u2013 with the proportion \u201clikely to improve further over the next 24 hours\u201d.\nHe blamed a shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers \u2013 a problem that has seen ministers put the Army on standby to drive fuel tankers.\nMeanwhile, Labour has suggested key workers should be prioritised for fuel to ensure teachers and doctors are not prevented from being able to do their jobs. The Guardian has learned that several NHS appointments for cancer patients at University College London hospital were rescheduled \u201cowing to the national fuel supply\u201d issue.\nSpeaking from his party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, Keir Starmer said ministers had \u201creduced the country to chaos as we track from crisis to crisis\u201d.\nThe haulage sector had been left \u201cbeyond frustrated\u201d and with the government \u201cdenying there\u2019s a problem, then blaming somebody else, and then coming up with a half-baked plan\u201d, Starmer claimed.\nHe suggested giving priority for fuel to key workers this week and issuing more visas for lorry drivers for at least six months instead of just three. \u201cWe have to take action today,\u201d Starmer said, adding: \u201cThis problem was predictable and predicted and the Government has absolutely failed to plan.\u201d\nJon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, told the Guardian that people could suffer or die as a result of a lack of access to care or treatment. \u201cWe have healthcare workers, care assistants, nurses and doctors desperately worried that they won\u2019t make it to the bedside of their sick patients,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have people at home who rely on a healthcare assistant or community nurse coming to visit them on a daily basis and their representative bodies are calling for a plan.\n\u201cHealth secretary Sajid Javid cannot keep his head down and hope this blows over. He\u2019s got to get a grip on this, show some leadership \u2026 If people cannot get to their patients, people obviously will suffer.\u201d\nAnd Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, urged ministers to stop blaming the public for the situation. Instead, he claimed that Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201ctoxic recipe of denial\u201d and \u201cboosterism\u201d about labour shortages were at fault.\nPollard told the Guardian: \u201cThis is a playbook we\u2019ve seen from the government for every crisis. Deny there\u2019s a problem. Fail to plan for the problem. Blame the public for the problem. Blame someone else and then call in the army. It is utter incompetence.\u201d\nIt comes after Downing Street said on Monday that army drivers would be ready to help deliver petrol and diesel on a short-term basis, but stopped short of an immediate deployment, even though some essential workers have not been able to carry out their jobs without fuel.\nTobias Ellwood, the chair of parliament\u2019s defence select committee, has said the army should be mobilised, not just put on standby, to regain public confidence.\n\u201cThe country wants to see the government is in command and it has a clear cross-Whitehall plan,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWe have gone from 1% fuel pump shortages to 90% so altering people\u2019s buying behaviour to prevent the panic-buying and going back to previous purchasing patterns requires regaining the confidence of the nation.\u201d",

European gas prices rose by 10%, with price pressure exacerbated by a dwindling supply from Russia.\nSupply dropped on Tuesday as the flow of Russian gas via the Yamal-Europe pipeline fell by more than half, the Interfax news agency reported, citing data from the grid operator Gascade.\nThe situation in the UK, where market prices have quadrupled in the past year, is particularly acute.\nEurope-wide price rises have been compounded by the UK\u2019s unusually low gas storage capacity, as well as outages in the electricity system, including a fire at a key power import cable, leading to increased reliance on gas power plants.\nConsumers have been warned to expect higher bills and more household energy supplier failures, while heavy industry and the food and drink sector are facing the prospect of shutdowns and pre-Christmas product shortages.\nThe \u201cwinter gas season\u201d, when heating demand is usually higher, starts on 1 October and there are predictions of a colder than average winter.\nWhile ministers have insisted the UK has enough gas to avoid the lights going out or a 1970s-style three-day working week, analysts warned low temperatures could exacerbate the crisis.\n\u201cIf the winter is colder than normal, natural gas supplies could run even shorter, leaving Europeans and possibly other countries, especially those that can barely afford current energy prices, in the cold,\u201d said analysts at SP Angel.\nTheir counterparts at Refinitiv warned that even warmer than expected temperatures \u201cmight not be enough\u201d to bring down prices. \u201cWe conclude that additional supply is a key driver for prices to soften this winter,\u201d they said.\nSupplies of Russian gas via the Yamal-Europe pipeline dropped to 15,021 megawatt hours (MWh) per hour on Tuesday morning from 35,131 MWh per hour on Monday.\nA group of European politicians wrote to the European commission this month calling for an investigation into whether the Russian state gas company Gazprom was acting deliberately to stem the flow of gas into Europe.\nThey expressed fears that Russia was wielding its regional gas supremacy to ramp up pressure to approve the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been subject to sanctions and is awaiting multiple regulatory approvals.\nA Kremlin spokesperson denied Russia was using gas as a weapon against Europe and said Gazprom was ready to boost supplies to Europe.\nAs gas prices rose, oil followed suit, with Brent trading above $80 a barrel for the first time in three years before falling again as traders pocketed profits.\nMarkets were reacting in part to the gas crisis, amid expectations that some factories would switch to oil to power their operations. Goldman Sachs has predicted Brent crude could hit $90 by the end of the year.\nThe resurgence of economies such as China and India after Covid-19 slowdowns has also forced up the price of fossil fuels, with thermal coal, used to generate electricity, up 96% this year.\nPrice pressure has been driven by an energy crunch in China, where attempts to decarbonise have met the reality of widespread factory outages and interrupted power supply to homes as winter approaches, fuelling coal demand.\nAs fossil fuel prices soared, so did the cost of allowances to emit carbon dioxide.\nTim Dixon, the lead analyst at Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cUK emissions trading scheme carbon prices also recorded [their] largest-ever day-on-day rise on our records, jumping \u00a38 per tonne tonne this morning to reach an all-time high of \u00a375 per tonne,.\n\u201cRising energy prices and ongoing high auction demand for carbon allowances are pushing this upwards.\u201d\nAs UK gas prices for winter rose, other benchmark gas prices did the same, with the British day-ahead contract jumping 4.75p to 178.00 p a therm in\n early morning trading.\nThe October gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, a European benchmark, was up \u20ac7.47, or 9.7%, at \u20ac84.00 a megawatt hour (MWh).",

But the eventual arrival into public hands of another troubled rail franchise is less surprising.\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced on Tuesday that the government would take over the Southeastern network from Go-Ahead in mid-October, after \u201cclear, compelling and serious evidence\u201d that the operator had for years \u201cbreached the trust that is absolutely fundamental to the success of our railways\u201d.\nWhile the \u00a325m has now been repaid, further investigations were being conducted into historical contract issues and fines could follow, and the matter has been referred to the Serious Fraud Office.\nFor passengers, not much will change. The Department for Transport\u2019s operator of last resort, however, now has to manage one of Britain\u2019s most populous commuter services, along with the geographically biggest network, Northern, and the main London-Edinburgh long-distance operator, LNER.\nThe death of franchising was long foretold, then officially declared in 2020, and more or less enacted. But the multimillion-pound discrepancies at Southeastern show that its spirit fully haunts the current setup, and it remains unclear how and when the government will achieve the systemic reforms it has promised.\nSoutheastern was operated by Govia, a joint venture between Go-Ahead and France\u2019s Keolis, that also runs GTR, the mega-franchise whose seven years to date include staffing crises and strikes at Southern, the timetabling debacle at Thameslink and the collapse of the Gatwick Express. For all that, Go-Ahead had largely remained a trusted and respected transport operating group, and GTR was a useful shield for the government when a highly specified franchise led to unworkable chaos.\nIn comparison, Southeastern had largely ticked along. But it still posed headaches for the DfT. In 2018, followingthe Virgin East Coast collapse, ministers said all bids to win the next Southeastern franchise were non-compliant with the terms of the competition. The process was re-run \u2013 but scrapped a year later. Go-Ahead got an extension, and another in 2020 when Covid hit.\nNow, less than three weeks before that contract was due formally to end or renew at the DfT\u2019s discretion, ministers have pulled the plug. Within the DfT and Govia, investigations continue into how the \u00a325m went astray, a month after the first \u201cdiscussions regarding the historic calculation of Southern profit\u201d were disclosed in an anodyne note to investors. Go-Ahead\u2019s chief financial officer, Elodie Brian \u2013 in direct charge of finance and contracts at Southeastern from 2014-19 \u2013 has quit, and the group has not contested the back payment.\nWhatever the exact nature of the breach, it came at a time when rail operators were staking ever larger sums to run franchises, putting many under pressure to meet over-ambitious financial targets. Annual revenues at Govia\u2019s two franchises were \u00a32.8bn in the year leading in to the pandemic. But with profit margins at 1-2%, an extra \u00a34m or \u00a35m each year from the taxpayer would influence bonuses and dividends, as the spectacular 25% drop in the Go-Ahead share price suggests.\nUnions are asking whether similar accounting practices could have occurred elsewhere; the RMT said the investigation should be widened into \u201ca forensic examination of all the private rail contracts\u201d.\nQuestions may be asked of Southeastern\u2019s auditors, Deloitte, who took over from EY in 2015, and were last year fined \u00a315m for failures relating to the sale of tech firm Autonomy. The accounting firm yesterday declined to comment.\nBut the fact that \u00a325m could slip down the back of Southeastern\u2019s sofa serves to highlight the complex way money sloshes back and forth around the railway. While the neighbouring commuter service South Western paid large premiums to the government, Southeastern was generally in receipt of subsidy, on top of the network grant to cover track access charges.\nIn Southeastern\u2019s case, that included a hefty whack required to run trains on the HS1 high-speed track to the Channel tunnel now owned by a consortium of investment funds. Net government support to Southeastern approached \u00a3400m in 2019, considerably more per passenger kilometre than comparable commuter services. It is understood that the financial irregularities were buried deep within this taxpayer-reliant high speed part of the business.\nEstablishing who owes what \u2013 for delays, compensation, and meeting franchise obligations \u2013 has occupied small armies of lawyers and accountants throughout rail\u2019s privatised era. Past Go-Ahead results have included multimillion-pound question marks as the reckonings with the DfT over GTR\u2019s contract played out.\nOne objective in the Williams-Shapps rail review has been that money will flow directly to and from a new Great British Railways, with contracts simplified. Whether the \u201csignificant breach of good faith\u201d at Southeastern turns out to be an isolated mistake or deliberate concealment, the missing \u00a325m will amplify calls to speed up reform, as well as calls for full rail renationalisation.",

A number of medical entrepreneurs and even some from outside the medical field have are hoping to get a piece of the market.\nPantonic Health, run by the daughters of David Panton, the partner of the former foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, was one of the first to receive approval in September last year.\nAfter 20 years in the business of running medical practices and pharmacies, the family-run business quickly appreciated the opportunities of the Covid pandemic and began focusing on importing and selling the US Carestart rapid antigen test in partnership with Arrotex Pharmaceuticals.\n\u201cPantonic is already supplying CareStart testing kits to various state and federal government departments, and numerous large corporations across Australia,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThese include the Howard Springs facility, which was set up by the commonwealth to house Australians returning from overseas on repatriation flights. The tests have also been used by large companies including Fortescue Metals Group, Qantas, Lendlease and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the spokesperson said.\nThe company says its tests have been shown to be highly sensitive to the Delta variant and have a very low false-positive rate of just 0.01%. It is now gearing up for a boom in sales and has already had 3,000 inquiries from schools.\nAnother newcomer is Suretest, founded by Dr Peter Lewis, whose website describes him as \u201can internationally recognised regenerative medicine physician\u201d.\nLewis runs a clinic in Malvern, Melbourne, which offers a range of services including platelet rich plasma therapies, which he uses to treat erectile dysfunction, hair loss and degenerative injuries.\nLewis is also the current chairman of the Australian Ringside Medical Association and the presiding doctor for most boxing and kickboxing fights in Victoria.\nLewis has been a strong advocate for rapid antigen testing in the media, regularly calling for their rollout in Australia.\n\u201cWe have a major laboratory pushback to antigen testing,\u201d he told the Age in January.\n\u201cAnyone associated with a laboratory is saying that PCR is the gold standard and that\u2019s absolutely true, but if you\u2019re a doctor like me and you\u2019re treating patients, you want a test that allows you to rapidly separate people who are infected from those who aren\u2019t,\u201d\u200b he said.\nLewis has applied to import rapid antigen tests produced in China by the Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co.\nLewis said he was delighted with the news that rapid antigen test could now be sold for home use.\n\u201cI have a warehouse full of tests and would like to start selling them tomorrow. These tests have been available for some time and they will really help in this life-threatening, economy-destroying pandemic,\u201d he said.\nAnother relative newcomer is Hough Pharma, which has featured in the Andrew Bolt Report on Sky and in News Corp websites.\nHough\u2019s managing director is Greg Hough, a former managing director of media company APN, who has spent time in the US in various businesses including events management and selling an all-natural veterinary joint supplement for pets, before heading up Hough Pharma on the Gold Coast.\nHis company is importing the Biohit Healthcare test, also produced in China.\nThe company says the testing system offers a linked \u201cplug and play results reporting system which will send results directly to a person\u2019s phone for storage in their online wallet\u201d.\nOther companies, such as Allsafe Medical and Pharma Soul, run by 33-year-old Stephanie Golman, were set up at the beginning of the pandemic to import protective equipment and have now pivoted to importing antigen tests.\nThe TGA has been using the Doherty Institute to assess all tests and its reports show that the tests can vary considerably in their reliability.\nA number, mainly sourced from China, have already been withdrawn by their sponsoring Australian importers after poor reliability results.\n This article was amended on 30 September 2021 to clarify that Pharma Soul is run by Stephanie Golman.",

And I think what we\u2019re seeing now is at least a hope, at least a hope that we may not get as much pressure as we thought on our hospital system, but that\u2019s by no means clear,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still taking a precautionary approach. We\u2019d have to expect, but hope that it doesn\u2019t happen, that the numbers will increase again over the next month. We\u2019re hoping it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Hazzard said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe Burnet Institute\u2019s modelling on hospitalisations did not take into account an easing of lockdown restrictions, which is likely to happen on 11 October.\nChris Moy, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, agreed with the NSW\u2019s government\u2019s assessment that its healthcare system wasn\u2019t \u201ctotally out of the woods yet\u201d.\nMoy said the planned reopening from lockdown, combined with the longer recovery period for Covid patients in ICU and hospital, meant the system could still become overwhelmed.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that on average they spend significantly longer in ICU and hospital in general, and Covid cases will increase generally when restrictions lift.\u201d\nMoy told Guardian Australia that even if the vaccinated population who catch Covid don\u2019t go into ICU, they could enter hospital or require healthcare that will ultimately be at the expense of other patients, whether that be in ICU or those receiving non-Covid care.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be displacing people either in hospital, outside of hospital or those who will delay their care into the future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the accrual of Covid patients in the system that is going to be the issue once we reopen,\u201d Moy said.\nNationally, ICU capacities have not been reached. The health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, said a survey undertaken by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society had estimated there were currently 2,000 ICU beds in use, with the potential for this to scale up by at least another 2,500 if necessary, with 500 of these beds staffed and immediately available.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nMurphy said the states and territories were finalising their plans for both surge capacity and a \u201cliving with Covid\u201d strategy for intensive care.\n\u201cThe surge capacity is very different from the living with Covid capacity,\u201d Murphy told a Senate inquiry on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe important thing is that the jurisdictions are now doing significant additional work to refine what they will see as able to be staffed in that additional capacity.\u201d\nMurphy said that last year the department had put in place a \u201ccrisis surge plan\u201d that had prepared for 6,000 ICU beds to be in use nationally, with sufficient ventilators purchased to service this many patients.\n\u201cThe sense at the moment is that that would not be something that could be sustained for more than a serious crisis, which is not something we will now contemplate in our vaccinated population, so a surge plan is planning for significantly less of an ICU capacity for that,\u201d Murphy said.",

They will also manage the areas in partnership with the Queensland government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big thing for Eastern Kuku Yalanji people, for us bama, which means people,\u201d said Chrissy Grant, a traditional owner and the incoming chair of the Wet Tropics Management Authority board.\n\u201cBama across the wet tropics have consistently lived within the rainforest. That in itself is something that is pretty unique to the world heritage listing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to work our way up ... we will be looking at long-term gains out of this, but we need to work our way up to get our people trained up confident.\u201d\nGrant, who is also the chair of the Unesco International Indigenous People\u2019s Forum for World Heritage, said the handback of the Daintree and surrounds would also help address a historical oversight, which meant rainforest Aboriginal people were not involved in the 1988 process for the world heritage listing of Queensland\u2019s wet tropics.\nAt the time, the Daintree rainforest had come under increasing threat from logging and other development being pushed by the entrenched National party government in Queensland.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe Australian government, led by Bob Hawke, successfully campaigned for the Unesco listing in 1988, despite fierce opposition from the Queensland state government.\nThe Unesco listing recognises the environmental value and the \u201cexceptional natural beauty\u201d of the world\u2019s oldest continually-surviving tropical rainforest, but not the Indigenous cultural values that are part of the formal Unesco listings at places like Uluru and Kakadu.\n\u201cIn 1988 there was no consultation with Aboriginal people and no recognition of the values of the ... oldest rainforest in the world, being continuously occupied by Aboriginal people,\u201d Grant said.\n\u201cWherever you go there are communities within the tropical rainforest.\n\u201cPeople were probably not upset about it back at that time, but certainly after that time people realised they were completely ignored, even what was world heritage, not a lot of awareness out there. They did it in a rush to try to stop forest logging, but in that process they completely ignored Aboriginal people.\u201d\nThe Australian government has since recognised the cultural value of the Daintree and the wet tropics, but the Unesco listing remains related to the environmental significance only.\nGrant said the national parks would eventually be managed solely by traditional owners.\n\u201cOur goal is to establish a foundation to provide ... pathways and opportunities for mentoring, training, apprenticeships, work experience and employment for our Eastern Kuku Yalanji bama to fill positions from a wide range of skilled trades, land and sea management, hospitality, tourism, and research so that we are in control of our own destinies.\u201d\nThe handback negotiations had taken four years and Grant said she hoped the model would offer a pathway for other Indigenous groups in other parts of the wet tropics to negotiate ownership of their traditional lands.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe Queensland environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the government had now returned 3.8m hectares (9.4m acres) of land at Cape York to traditional owners.\n\u201cThe Eastern Kuku Yalanji people\u2019s culture is one of the world\u2019s oldest living cultures and this agreement recognises their right to own and manage their country, to protect their culture and to share it with visitors as they become leaders in the tourism industry,\u201d Scanlon said.\n\u201cThese national parks will protect important Aboriginal cultural sites, diverse ecosystems including rainforests, woodlands, wetlands and mangroves, and form part of the Wet Tropics world heritage area which is recognised as the second-most irreplaceable world heritage site on earth.\u201d\nThe Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partnerships minister, Craig Crawford, said the handback showed the government was \u201ccommitted to reconciliation, Treaty and righting the wrongs of past generations\u201d.\n\u201cSome of the benefits for the traditional owners will be funds provided annually and in perpetuity for the joint management of the national parks,\u201d he said.\nConservation groups also welcomed the agreement.\nAndrew Picone, the protected areas campaign manager for the Queensland Conservation Council, said returning the parks to the Eastern Kuku Yalanji was \u201cthe best way to protect the area\u2019s natural and cultural values\u201d.",

        "content": "Andy McDonald\u2019s no-show gives the former leader free rein to revel in his lack of responsibility\nI suppose it couldn\u2019t last. Having spent much of the first two days of the party conference squabbling, rather than enjoying the ongoing Tory crises of fuel shortages and energy price rises, it had seemed that things had become a little more comradely. But late in the afternoon the two tribes went to war again with the unexpected resignation of Andy McDonald as shadow secretary for employment rights.\nMost people had taken a while to remember that McDonald had actually been in the shadow cabinet. And that included Keir Starmer who \u2013 when reminded \u2013 sounded almost thrilled that the last Corbynista in his top team had done a runner.\nIt had all been rather confusing. Having spent much of the previous week working on a green paper with Angela Rayner that included raising the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour \u2013 and having campaigned for that in the 2019 general election \u2013 McDonald now found himself forced to resign because he had only just realised that his new demand for a \u00a315 minimum wage had been rejected by the party leadership. He also claimed that the party had never been so divided. Memory clearly isn\u2019t one of his strong points.\nMcDonald, along with Jeremy Corbyn, had also been due to speak at a fringe meeting in a nightclub in support of Barry Gardiner\u2019s private member\u2019s bill to stop \u201cfire and rehire\u201d practices the following morning. But half an hour before the event was due to start I was told that Andy had gone back to London.\nNot that the 100 or so people packed into the venue seemed that bothered by McDonald\u2019s no-show as he had never been the main attraction for them. As Corbyn entered the room, a chorus of \u201cOh Je-re-my Cor-byn\u201d broke out. It was like being in a time warp: 2019. Or even two years earlier. There are still some members on the left who think that Corbyn actually won the 2017 general election.\nCorbyn took it all comfortably in his stride. It\u2019s almost as though he\u2019s happiest as the voice of protest rather than having to present himself as a credible party leader who needs to win over half the country. Though he still likes the adulation he gets from his supporters, he never actually much wanted the hassle. Trying to convince people that he was all in favour of a nuclear deterrent, provided submarines didn\u2019t carry any nuclear missiles, was never his strongest point. Now though he is free to do what he likes best: lap up the love, speak from the hip but never be responsible for the outcomes.\nHaving explained at some length why Gardiner\u2019s bill was unlikely to succeed \u2013 private members\u2019 bills seldom do \u2013 Corbyn effortlessly went on to say he would be giving it his full backing. A beacon of integrity or the patron saint of lost causes, take your pick. At which point a balloon burst in sympathy and a member of the audience asked Jeremy if he would apologise for saying that antisemitism in the Labour party had been overstated. A chorus of boos greeted this question while Corbyn went into his comfort zone of saying he condemned racism in all its forms. Cue loud cheers.\nFor the most part, though, Corbyn was happy not to make waves. He resisted the opportunity to criticise Starmer directly, while implying that there was almost nothing Keir could say in his conference speech that would properly satisfy him. You can\u2019t live on the margins by embracing the mainstream.\nLess than an hour later, Corbyn was at another fringe meeting about the war on terror. Yet again he seemed totally in his stress-free place as he covered everything from dodgy dossiers to Palestine and was rewarded with a standing ovation from half the room. A frown crossed his face. Only half? Still, he was asked for a couple of selfies on the way out. Over in the main hall, the conference was pressing on without him. Which was pretty much the way he liked it. If he was on the margins and being ignored, then he must be doing something right.",

Blackpool council had said using the hotel for temporary accommodation required planning consent and it had been going to seek a court injunction on Monday in an attempt to stop the arrangement.\nThe seaside resort is particularly busy at present. The Blackpool Illuminations light show runs until 3 January and the town is also hosting the World Fireworks Championships near the hotel, likely to cause disruption and noise to the hotel\u2019s vulnerable residents.\nBlackpool is the latest council to express concern about the suitability of housing asylum seekers in hotels. Earlier this month, a report documented the deterioration in the mental and physical health of asylum seekers in Glasgow when housed in hotels.\nLynn Williams, the Labour leader of Blackpool council, said the local authority was promised it would be informed in advance of any arrivals, and that nobody would be placed in the hotel before Monday at the earliest. However, people were moved in overnight on Sunday and in the early hours of Monday morning, with more expected this week.\nWilliams said the council had received no official notification until Monday lunchtime, despite the assurances sought on behalf of local health leaders, who said services were facing unprecedented demand.\nThe council leader said she was \u201cfurther disappointed\u201d that the Home Office and Serco had made the move after being informed the council was seeking an injunction, with a court hearing scheduled for Monday. \u201cI am saddened that they have acted in a way that smacks of a deliberate move to frustrate the justice system,\u201d she said.\nWilliams urged Blackpool residents to show compassion and understanding to the \u201cvery vulnerable families and children who have arrived with us here in Blackpool\u201d. She said the council would work to ensure that the \u201cappropriate support\u201d was in place for the families, and would be reviewing its legal position.\nSerco and the Home Office have been criticised for placing asylum seekers in Britannia hotels in Wolverhampton and Wigan this month. Lisa Nandy, the town\u2019s MP, said that the hotel, which has been targeted by a far-right group, had previously been deemed \u201ccompletely unsuitable accommodation\u201d for asylum seekers.\nThe leader of Wolverhampton council, Ian Brookfield, also accused Serco of lacking humanity, when 200 Afghan families were placed in the city without warning. \u201cSome of them have arrived here in a terrible state, there\u2019s people with no clothes, no nappies for the kids,\u201d Brookfield said. \u201cWe know Serco are running this, but they could at least put a little bit of humanity into it. As a council, we are left out of the whole process.\u201d\nSerco was one of the three outsourcing firms awarded the contract to house asylum seekers in 2019, despite having been fined nearly \u00a37m for previous failings. The firm, which has the contract for housing in the north-west, the Midlands and the east of England, said hotels were used only as a \u201clast resort\u201d.\n\u201cWith the significant increases in the number of people arriving in the UK we have been faced with no alternative but to temporarily accommodate some asylum seekers in hotels\u201d, said Jenni Halliday, Serco\u2019s contract director for asylum accommodation services.\nAccording to Home Office statistics, there were 31,115 asylum applications in the UK in the year ending June 2021, 4% fewer than the previous year. The government has promised to allow 20,000 Afghan refugees to settle in the UK, with 5,000 expected to arrive by the end of 2021.\nThe Home Office said that the \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d meant temporary accommodation such as hotels has had to be used \u201cto manage demands on the asylum estate\u201d. It said the Home Office had met local police, public health providers and officers from Blackpool council, and that all hotels used by the Home Office met health and safety legislation.",

The bonus would come on top of his base salary of \u00a31m a year.\nFrasers announced in August that Murray, who began working for Ashley\u2019s retail group in 2016, was scheduled to take over from his future father-in-law as chief executive next year.\nChris Wootton, Frasers\u2019 finance director, would receive up to \u00a39m under the new share bonus scheme, which would begin to pay out if the share price hit \u00a312 for the 30-day period according to Frasers\u2019 annual report.\nIn the past year, Wootton was awarded a \u00a3100,000 cash bonus on top of his \u00a3150,000 salary in recognition of his \u201cexceptional efforts in leading the company through a period of unprecedented challenge\u201d during the pandemic. On 1 May this year his salary was raised to \u00a3250,000 and he can earn an annual bonus of up to \u00a3500,000 more and up to \u00a39m under the new long-term share bonus scheme.\nFrasers said the targets of the new share bonus scheme were both \u201cstretching and achievable\u201d.\nHowever, the payments come after Frasers claimed \u00a380m in furlough assistance and \u00a397.5m in business rates relief globally last year \u2013 the company did not define how much it claimed in the UK, but it is likely to be the majority of that figure.\nGlass Lewis advised investors to block approval of Frasers\u2019 remuneration plans as it was \u201cconcerned with committee\u2019s decision to grant a discretionary bonus to the CFO, particularly in light of the stakeholder experience through the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d.\nIt also expressed \u201cserious reservations\u201d about the new share bonus scheme which it said could reward \u201cshort spikes in performance, as opposed to sustainable long-term growth\u201d.\nPirc also advised investors to oppose the new share bonus scheme saying incentives linked solely to a company\u2019s share price risked rewarding failure. \u201cUplift [in the share price] by favourable macroeconomic influences may see executives disproportionately rewarded for minimum effort,\u201d its report said.\nPirc said investors should not approve the group\u2019s remuneration report and the reappointment of chairman David Daly and senior independent director Richard Bottomley.\nBottomley is criticised, as head of the audit committee, because Frasers has no externally run whistleblowing hotline. \u201cThis suggests that such concerns that should be raised by a whistleblower are dealt with internally, which may increase the risk of such issues not being followed up or escalating to a level where the higher was the level of the misconduct, the more likely is the issue to be concealed.\u201d",

It remains to be seen whether or not the Taliban can consolidate power, or if the country will further fracture into civil war.\u201d\nIt was a long and very difficult day in Congress for the Biden administration, which has been trying to move past the reputational damage caused by the sudden fall of Kabul last month and subsequent scramble to evacuate Americans and allies, which left tens of thousands of vulnerable Afghans behind.\nMilley, Austin and McKenzie all confirmed that when the Biden administration was considering its policy on Afghanistan in its first few months in office, they had believed a small US force of about 2,500 should remain.\nNone could explain Joe Biden\u2019s claim in an interview last month that he had not received any such advice.\n\u201cNo one said that to me that I can recall,\u201d Biden told ABC News on 19 August.\nMilley adamantly rejected a suggestion by Republican senator Tom Cotton he should resign because that advice was rejected.\n\u201cIt would be an incredible act of political defiance for a commissioned officer to just resign because my advice is not taken,\u201d he said, staring straight at Cotton. \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t want generals figuring out what orders we\u2019re going to accept and do or not. That\u2019s not our job.\u201d\nIn his 19 August interview, Biden had said that US forces would stay until all American citizens had been evacuated. But when the last soldier left on a flight on 30 August, there were still believed to be more than a hundred Americans \u2013 most if not all dual nationals who had delayed their decision to leave until it was too late.\nMilley said it was the advice of the military leadership to stick to the end of August deadline to complete the departure, which the Taliban had accepted.\nIf the US had stayed on into September to try to evacuate more people, he said: \u201cWe would have been at war with the Taliban again,\u201d requiring an extra 20,000 troops to clear Kabul of Taliban fighters and retake Bagram air base near the capital, which the US had abandoned in July.\nMilley also had to defend himself against charges that he deliberately sought to undermine Donald Trump\u2019s authority as commander-in-chief out of fear that the former president would launch a foreign war as a diversion to distract attention from his election loss in November.\n\u201cMy loyalty to this nation, its people and the constitution hasn\u2019t changed and will never change,\u201d Milley told the Senate armed services committee on Tuesday. \u201cAs long as I have a breath to give, my loyalty is absolute.\u201d\nMilley was facing hostile Republicans, some of whom have demanded his resignation following revelations that he spoke twice to his Chinese counterpart, reassuring him that the US would not launch a surprise attack.\nThe revelations are contained in a new book, Peril, by the Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa.\nAccording to the book, Milley also ordered officers assigned to the Pentagon war room to let him know if Trump ordered a nuclear launch, despite the fact that the chairman of the joint chiefs is not in the chain of command.\nThe general said his two calls with the Chinese army chief followed intelligence suggesting China was fearful of an attack, and were intended to defuse tensions.\n\u201cI am certain President Trump did not intend to attack the Chinese,\u201d Milley said, adding he had been directed by the defence secretary to convey that message to the Chinese.\n\u201cMy task at that time was to de-escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cMy message again was consistent: stay calm, steady and de-escalate. We are not going to attack you.\u201d\nHe said the calls were closely coordinated with the defence secretary and other senior officials in the Trump administration, and that several senior Pentagon officials sat in on the calls.\nOn the question of his actions on nuclear launch procedures, Milley said he had a responsibility to insert himself into those procedures in order to be able to perform his role to advise the president properly.\n\u201cBy law I am not in the chain of command and I know that,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, by presidential directive, and [defence department] instruction, I am in the chain of communication to fulfil my legal statutory role as the president\u2019s primary military adviser.\u201d",

Previously, more than 150 healthcare workers employed at Houston Methodist Hospital were either fired or resigned after a hospital-wide vaccine mandate, one of the first vaccination requirements in a healthcare setting.\nOriginally, approximately 375 unvaccinated employees from Novant Health, spanning 15 hospitals and 800 clinics, were suspended for not getting vaccinated and given five days to comply.\nAbout 200 of the suspended employees received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by Friday, tweeted Novant Health spokesperson Megan Rivers, meaning 99% of Novant Health\u2019s approximately 35,000 employees followed the vaccine mandate. The rest of the workers were dismissed, though an exact number has not been confirmed.\nUpdate: Last week, nearly 200 additional team members came into compliance with vaccine mandate, increasing that rate across @NovantHealth to over 99%.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be prouder of our team members who made the choice to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and remain part of our team at Novant Health,\u201d the hospital group said in a statement.\nNovant Health had announced the vaccine mandate on 22 July and had given employees until 15 September to get vaccinated, according to the Post.\nAny employees that were granted an exemption from the required vaccination are required to complete weekly coronavirus testing and wear an N95 respirator mask and other personal protective equipment while working on any Novant Health hospital or clinic.\nRather than comply with the mandate, some employees are seeking work elsewhere. Laura Rushing, a nurse who has worked with the company for 16 years, said that she is looking for a new job after her religious exemption was denied by the hospital.\n\u201cWho decided my religious exemption, the wording used was not good enough? It wasn\u2019t as good as someone else\u2019s? That just feels like discrimination and I didn\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Rushing to WSOC, a local news affiliate.",

He was sacked by the Met after his admission of guilt.\nHe had also admitted to kidnap and rape during an incident where he had driven the marketing manager from London to where her body was ultimately discovered, in woodland near Ashford in Kent.\nSpeaking after Couzens admitted the offences, the Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said: \u201cI have 44,000 people working in the Met. Sadly, some of them are abused at home, for example, and sadly, on occasion, I have a bad \u2019un.\u201d\nKaren Ingala Smith, a co-founder of the Femicide Census, told the Times that the problem went \u201cway deeper\u201d than what could be described as a \u201cbad \u2019un\u201d. An example she pointed to was the scandal of undercover officers engaging in sexual relationships with activists who they targeted.\nThis month a serving officer in the Met was charged with voyeurism offences.\nIngala Smith criticised \u201cdisbelieving attitudes that enable rapists, rather than support rape victims\u201d. She said: \u201cThis is not the problem of a few \u2018bad \u2019uns\u2019 but systemic and institutional sexism. The Femicide Census has shown that even murder of a woman was not a one-off.\u201d\nThe census data, which included Couzens, showed 10 murders by police officers, former police officers and a former special constable since 2009.\nOther cases were classed as manslaughter and included Dorset constable Timothy Brehmer, who had strangled a woman he had been having an affair with after she exposed him to his wife. Brehmer was cleared of murder.\nIn most cases, which usually involved former officers, the women had been intimate partners, formerly intimate partners or the spouse of the perpetrator.\nCases included Ivan Escak, who was jailed for life in 2013 for murdering his estranged wife by stabbing her 11 times at her hair salon in Ashford, Kent.\nWilliam Kean, a former special constable with Tayside police, was convicted in 2012 of beating an 80-year-old charity volunteer to death to steal money from her.\nIn 2011, former detective Peter Foster murdered his partner, a police officer, by hitting her with a baseball bat and stabbing her in the throat.",

        "content": "Leader\u2019s conference speech will aim to present Labour as a party that is \u2018back in business\u2019 and ready for power\nKeir Starmer will on Wednesday repudiate the legacy of Jeremy Corbyn and accuse the government of being \u201clost in the woods\u201d in a keenly awaited conference speech that will put addressing Britain\u2019s mental health crisis at the heart of his pitch to voters.\nIn a sign of the significance the Labour leader puts on the issue, Starmer will promise a Labour government will make mental health treatment available to everyone who needs it within a month, and create drop-in mental health hubs aimed at children and young people.\nThe pledges will be set out in his first \u201cin-person\u201d address to his party\u2019s conference in Brighton which he hopes will show Labour is \u201cback in business,\u201d and has a programme for tackling \u201cthe chronic problems revealed by Covid\u201d.\nLabour believes the mounting fuel crisis is stoking voters\u2019 concerns about Boris Johnson\u2019s competence, with the government assailed on a number of fronts and even the Tory-leaning press accusing Downing Street of having lost its grip. \u201cThe shine has come off,\u201d said a party spokesperson.\nAfter a conference marred by divisions over party rule changes and the resignation of left-winger Andy McDonald from the shadow cabinet, Starmer\u2019s speech will seek to present Labour as a government in waiting.\nAsked on Tuesday whether he would prioritise party unity or winning the general election, he told the BBC it would be \u201cwinning\u201d.\nThough Starmer is not expected to mention his predecessor by name, the tenor of the speech will be aimed at underlining the stark differences between the two men and their policies.\nA Labour source said: \u201cThe speech will be a demonstration of the way the Labour party has changed. It will be a clear indication that Labour will never again go into an election with a manifesto that isn\u2019t a serious plan for government.\u201d\nAs Boris Johnson on Tuesday appealed to the public not to fill their cars with petrol unless necessary, Starmer will seek to contrast the government\u2019s chaotic approach with the scale of the challenges facing the country.\nHe is expected to say: \u201cI see the government lost in the woods with two paths beckoning. One path leads back where we came from. None of the lessons of Covid are heeded. The divisions and flaws that were brutally exposed by the pandemic all worsen.\n\u201cBut there is another path down which we address the chronic problems revealed by Covid with the kindness and the togetherness that got us through.\u201d\nHe will call mental health \u201cone of the urgent needs of our time,\u201d and promise that a Labour government will tackle it on a number of fronts.\nAs well as setting a new NHS target guaranteeing treatment within a month, and creating \u201chubs\u201d for young people, Starmer will pledge to recruit 8,500 new mental health staff and ensure every secondary school has a full-time mental health specialist.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure children and young people get early help, putting specialist support in every school and a mental health hub in every community,\u201d he will say. \u201cThis is prevention in action. Helping young people, looking after their wellbeing.\u201d\nLabour calculates the package of measures would cost \u00a31bn a year by the end of the next parliament, allowing one million more people to be treated annually than the government is currently planning to help.\nIt would fund the policies with two tax increases already announced \u2013 the charging of VAT on private school fees, and the closing of loopholes used by private equity investors.\nThe Labour leader succeeded in pushing through a series of radical changes to Labour\u2019s internal rulebook on Sunday in the face of furious objections from the party\u2019s leftwingers.\nWhen McDonald resigned as shadow employment rights minister on Tuesday, he claimed Starmer had repudiated the \u201c10 principles\u201d on which he won the leadership, and exacerbated the party\u2019s divisions.\nMcDonald abruptly stepped down on Tuesday, saying Starmer\u2019s office was asking him to reject union calls for a \u00a315 an hour minimum wage, which he felt he could not do.\nConference delegates backed a motion calling for the \u00a315 minimum wage in Brighton on Tuesday, but Starmer said he did not agree with the policy.\nSpeaking to ITV News in Brighton, the Labour leader said: \u201cI will vote of course in accordance with the policy that we unveiled on Saturday. We were very clear on Saturday that a \u00a310 minimum wage, which is a 12% increase and means \u00a32,000 in real money for those who would benefit under that, that is significant, that is our policy.\u201d\nThe Labour leader denied that he had been pleased about McDonald\u2019s resignation, after speculation that he had been keen to sack him in May\u2019s reshuffle.\nBut some in the leader\u2019s team believe a confrontation with the left of his party will serve to convince the public Labour has changed.\nStarmer said he had spoken to his deputy, Angela Rayner, about the strong language she used at a party fringe meeting on Saturday evening, calling the Conservative government \u201cscum\u201d.\n\u201cAngela Rayner and I have different approaches and different styles,\u201d he told SkyNews. Asked if they also had different opinions, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not language I would have used. Angela and I talk every day. Of course we have huge agreements and disagreements.\u201d Rayner refused to apologise after her comments.\nStarmer will be joined in the conference hall in Brighton by his wife, after spending part of their family summer holiday hammering out a first draft of his speech.\nMany colleagues regard it as a make-or-break moment for his leadership, amid concerns about whether the party has succeeded in gaining a hearing from the electorate \u2013 and whether the public knows what Starmer stands for.",

This followed Idrissa Gueye\u2019s opener before the break.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to have scored,\u201d Messi told Canal+. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been able to play recently and this was only my second game in this stadium. I\u2019m adapting to my new team. The more we forwards play together the better our relationship will be. We all need to grow together and improve and keep giving our best.\n\u201cThey were great opponents. It was very important for us to win the match after our [opening] draw against Brugge. I really wanted to get out there. I haven\u2019t played much. I\u2019m still getting used to my teammates, the team, and today was an important moment.\u201d\nCity are third after two matches but only a point behind PSG and Club Brugge. Pep Guardiola was pleased with their display. \u201cWe had a really good game with good personality but you have to score goals and we didn\u2019t do it, that\u2019s why we lost,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThey defended deep and of course their counter-attack is always dangerous with the quality that they have. We controlled them. We couldn\u2019t score, that\u2019s football. Nothing else to say. My biggest compliment to the team.\u201d\nOf Messi, City\u2019s manager said: \u201cThe goal was fantastic. We know it\u2019simpossible to control Leo during 90 minutes but he was not [too] much in touch with the ball. He was coming back from injury but we know quite well what he can do when he can run and get close to the box: he is unstoppable. We did quite well to reduce those chances.\u201d\nGuardiola managed Messi when in charge of Barcelona and he hopes the six-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner can continue his success in the French capital. \u201cI wish him the best, if he is happy and enjoying this period in Paris I will be happy. He decided for many reasons to come here, for him and his family,\u201d he said of the Argentinian\u2019s move in the summer.\nGuardiola is also an admirer of the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti. \u201cI\u2019m in love. He is an exceptional player because when he is under pressure he is calm, he has that extra touch, to create extra passes behind our midfield,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are going to eat good, drink a glass of wine and recover.\u201d",

        "content": "Once the great vaccination success story, the island is under strain amid a new wave of infections, but experts say cases would be far higher without vaccine coverage\nOutside Guam Memorial hospital, blue medical tents have sprung up to accomodate an overflow of Covid patients.\nThe sight is bewildering for Guam residents. The island ran an incredibly successful vaccination campaign, with almost 90% of eligible people having received two doses, and even began offering jabs to tourists in an \u201cAir VnV\u201d \u2013 vacation and vaccination \u2013 scheme.\nBut the tents have been installed to accommodate an overflow of Covid patients at the hospital as the territory grapples with a third wave of the virus, with daily deaths reaching the highest rates since March 2020.\n\u201cWe just have no space \u2013 we have Covid patients waiting outside,\u201d Pauline Perez, a nurse at the hospital, said in a government-released video that appeals to the remaining vaccine stragglers to get their shots.\n\u201cWe use the blue med tents for Covid-19 patients who are stable. They need to be checked up by doctors but they don\u2019t need treatment.\u201d\nEven before the onset of the pandemic, Guam\u2019s healthcare system was fragile, but the surge in Covid cases triggered by the Delta variant has pushed it to the verge of collapsing.\nLast week, the government hospital paused its services for all elective surgeries in order to realign its limited resources.\n\u201cStaffing is the issue, which is why we suspended elective surgeries to free up more staff to support more patients,\u201d said Mai Habib, a spokesperson for the hospital.\nThe Guam Regional Medical City, a private hospital, is in the same predicament.\n\u201cWe are in a crisis. I will not sugarcoat that at all,\u201d Dr Alexander Wielaard, its medical director, said. \u201cWe have been seeing an abnormal number of patients.\u201d\nGuam has been seeing close to 300 cases some days in the last few weeks, reversing months of steady decline. It has recorded 14,705 cases \u2013 nine percent of Guam\u2019s population of 160,000 \u2013 and 195 deaths.\nCovid test results in the past two months have shown an alarming rate of breakthrough cases of people who had been vaccinated, including 554 of the 1,765 positive cases in August. Overall, breakthrough cases represent 31% of infections \u2013 the highest rate in the US, where most states have less than 1%. Breakthrough patients in Guam account for about 40% of hospital admissions.\nThe Covid surge is perplexing for a territory with a vaccination rate close to 90%, ranking sixth in the US. To date, a total of 118,756 people \u2013 or 87.13% \u2013 of Guam\u2019s eligible population (residents 12 years and older) are fully vaccinated. That includes 10,318 residents aged 12 to 17.\nThe high rate of breakthrough cases has led to fear in the community.\n\u201cOne of my officemates received her results of swab test and she turned out positive,\u201d said Dori Leomo, a resident of Tamuning. \u201cI cried after I heard the news. It\u2019s my first time to feel anxiety. The following day, all of us at work went to get our swab tests. Thank God I tested negative.\u201d\nWhile there has been some vaccine hesitancy, experts caution that the vaccines are working to protect citizens, and estimate that case numbers would be three times higher than they are had the vaccination rate not been so high and that when vaccinated people are hospitalised, their stays are much shorter and illnesses much less severe.\n\u201cIt is clear that most people who stay longer in the hospital are unvaccinated. The length of stay for people who are vaccinated average around two days. They are minor admissions and use less amount of resources at the hospital than those who are unvaccinated,\u201d said Dr Nathan Berg, who heads the governor\u2019s physician advisory group.\nAs for the reasons why there has been such a big third wave on the island, experts point to a number of factors.\n\u201cBest guess on our higher rate may be related to close family culture and our high co-morbidities, which might lower the immune system,\u201d said Dr Hoa Nguyen, the former chair of the governor\u2019s physicians advisory group.\nHe attributes the surge to the lifting of restrictions on social gatherings such as weddings and funerals, and believes Guam may have prematurely returned to normal as the Delta variant reached the island.\n\u201cYou have to look at the number of tests we are doing,\u201d says Berg, who pointed to the fact Guam\u2019s testing rate was higher than any other US state. \u201cThat is a good thing, and those numbers should not be taken out of context.\u201d\nHe added that the people who died despite being fully vaccinated all had multiple co-morbidities.\nDr Peter Lombard, a member of the advisory group, attributed the high rate of breakthrough cases to waning efficacy of the vaccine six months after being administered.\n\u201cI trust that the data is real. Now is it a cause for alarm? That is the question,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing you need to do is look at other places that have good vaccination rates and high allocation of vaccines early on.\n\u201cLooking at distribution of vaccines and the high volume of vaccines given to Guam, I suspect that is since we have a larger vaccinated population early on and the vaccines\u2019 efficacy waned sooner than we see in other states.\u201d\nLombard also said a premature lifting of restrictions was partially responsible for the Covid surge.\nLombard and Berg agreed that Guam had benefitted from its high vaccination rate, with Lombard saying Guam\u2019s case numbers would have been three times worse if not for the vaccination campaign.\nBerg said that despite the recent Covid surge, \u201cif you look at the population\u2019s fatality rate, we are still doing well \u2013 that is an accomplishment in itself\u201d.",

        "content": "45 new positives in a day as National party lays out coronavirus plan for \u2018vigorous suppression\u2019 instead of elimination\nNew Zealand\u2019s daily Covid cases have jumped sharply to 45 \u2013 more than five times the previous day\u2019s number. The rise comes after several days of about 12 cases a day, and around a week after the Auckland region lifted its strictest lockdown restrictions.\n\u201cThis is a big number. It\u2019s a sobering number. I don\u2019t think anybody who\u2019s involved in this process would be celebrating a number like the one we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d said the Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins.\n\u201cBut the fact that such a significant proportion of those are known contacts or household contacts does point a little bit to the nature of this particular outbreak that we\u2019re now dealing with in the way it\u2019s concentrated in larger households.\u201d\nThe director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said a number of the cases had been expected by health officials \u2013 much of Auckland\u2019s outbreak is spreading through large family groups. Thirty-three of the new cases were known household or close contacts of existing cases. Of these, 26 were household contacts, and 12 came from two households. Twelve cases were unlinked.\nOfficials urged people to continue following level 3 rules and get tested. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got to hold our nerve here,\u201d Hipkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re still aiming to run this into the ground.\u201d\nThe government lifted some restrictions in Auckland last week after a month of lockdown, in what experts called a \u201cgamble\u201d and a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d. The changes saw an estimated 300,000 additional people return to work in their city workplaces.\nBloomfield said: \u201cSome of our cases today may have been working in essential or permitted businesses \u2026 this emphasises the importance of everyone in Auckland continuing to abide by level 3 measures. They are there for a reason.\u201d Asked if New Zealand would have seen this number of cases under level 4, Hipkins said \u201cpossibly\u201d.\nThe leap in cases comes as the government faces its first major challenge from opposition parties on the elimination strategy.\nNew Zealand\u2019s largest opposition party unveiled its Covid plan on Wednesday, which would see lockdowns permanently scrapped once 70-75% of the eligible population is vaccinated, and quarantine-free travel allowed at 85% for those who are fully vaccinated.\nThe National party\u2019s leader, Judith Collins, said elimination had worked while vaccines were under development, but now the plan must change. \u201cIf adopted, National\u2019s plan means Kiwis overseas could come home to spend this Christmas with loved ones or take an overseas holiday for new year\u2019s,\u201d Collins said.\nCollins said the prime minister had not offered a specific vaccine target while \u201cministers throw around numbers willy-nilly\u201d. She also took aim at the government\u2019s proposed trial that would allow 150 business people to return and isolate at home before Christmas: \u201cIt\u2019s an insult.\u201d\nThe National party says its three-pillar plan has been \u201cthoroughly vetted\u201d by experts, but it has declined to publicly name those experts.\nThe first pillar of the plan includes 10 steps for \u201csupercharging\u201d vaccination rates, going door-to-door to reach vulnerable communities, and boosting testing measures and health service capacity. The second pillar aims to end lockdowns, once vaccination reaches 70-75%.\nNational\u2019s Covid-19 response spokesperson, Chris Bishop, said the third pillar was about reconnecting New Zealand back to the world, with a system that would create different isolation requirements for returnees, depending on the country of origin\u2019s Covid-19 status.\nJust prior to the Delta outbreak, the government announced its border reopening strategy, which also takes into account the risk level of the countries people are returning from. That plan is under review after the outbreak.\nMeanwhile thousands of New Zealanders overseas are struggling to book a spot in managed isolation. On Tuesday 3,800 places were released and snapped up in seconds, leaving tens of thousands of others on hold for the next round, due in the coming weeks.\nBishop said the government was running \u201ca lottery in human misery every week\u201d, adding that the party was advocating for a \u201cvigorous suppression\u201d method, over elimination, to allow people to return.\n\u201cDelta\u2019s here, it\u2019s gonna come back, there will be Covid in the community and we need to reopen, whilst making sure we mitigate the impacts of Covid and have a low number of cases.\u201d\nHipkins said he had not looked at National\u2019s plan in detail but it was \u201cclear the party wants to throw open the borders\u201d and allow hundreds of thousands of people to come into the country. \u201cTherefore one can conclude that the biggest promise they are making at the moment is they are willing for Kiwis to get Covid for Christmas.\u201d\nHipkins said the party had not provided any modelling for the number of cases it would be willing to tolerate, nor what it would do if there were significant case numbers in the community.",

        "content": "The ACCC has responded to fears that major airports could \u2018take advantage\u2019 of the Covid reopening to recover lost profits\nAustralians travelling domestically could be hit by a spike in airfare costs in coming months and years, the consumer watchdog has warned, as it puts capital city airports on notice amid fears they could be \u201csystematically taking advantage\u201d of the Covid-reopening and hiking fees they charge airlines.\nIn its Airline Competition in Australia report released on Wednesday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has also found people flying in and out of regional Australia continue to face higher ticket costs.\nThis is due to a lack of core demand on some routes, as well as diminishing competition since Virgin Australia\u2019s restructuring last year that has seen Qantas extend its dominance on regional travel.\nLockdowns and Covid restrictions were continuing to shrink aviation operations in Australia, with July marking the first time ever that routes in and out of Sydney airport did not feature in the top 10 busiest Australian routes.\nWith New South Wales and Victorian residents barred from most states and under lockdown, intrastate routes in Queensland and Western Australia were among the busiest routes in July. Brisbane to Cairns was the busiest route, with routes from Townsville and Mackayand Perth to Karratha also busy.\nAs lockdowns set in across NSW and Victoria in July, airlines were forced to cancel one in three domestic flights across all states. The ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said Sydney dropping out of the top 10 busiest routes \u201cis a sign of the state of the industry\u201d.\nThe bleak portrait of the domestic aviation industry painted by the ACCC\u2019s report follows a wave of excitement among Australian travellers triggered by state government reopening plans, with Qantas\u2019s international and domestic flight schedules also leading to a surge in travel searches.\nA survey of traveller sentiment released on Tuesday showed 59% of Australians planned to catch a flight, either international or domestic, by March.\nDomestic travel had recovered strongly in the first half of the year, before the Delta variant broke out across several states, with levels in April at 68% of pre-pandemic passenger traffic.\nHowever, Delta lockdowns and border closures ground travel from traditionally busy routes to a halt, with domestic passenger levels in July dropping to 23% of pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile the ACCC\u2019s report collected data until the end of July, the watchdog said air travel was \u201cexpected to have fallen further during August and September 2021\u201d as lockdowns continued in a number of states and territories.\n\u201cThe Delta outbreak has hit the domestic airline industry hard, and it has unfortunately halted the airlines\u2019 recovery just as they were starting to approach pre-pandemic levels of flying,\u201d Sims said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nEarlier this month, the Morrison government announced it would extend a $750 a week aviation support for cabin crew and pilots to international airlines until March, at a cost of $183m, a sign the sector will not significantly expand operations until next year.\nThe ACCC\u2019s monitoring found the aviation industry \u201cremains optimistic that demand for domestic travel, especially to leisure destinations, will bounce back strongly when vaccination targets are reached and border restrictions are eased\u201d.\nHowever, airlines have voiced concerns to the watchdog that as they are renegotiating contracts with major airports, they are concerned that airports are seeking to \u201csignificantly increase aeronautical charges to recover their Covid-19 lost profits\u201d.\nSims said the ACCC would monitor airports\u2019 pricing to determine if they were \u201csystematically taking advantage of their market power\u201d.\nThe ACCC warned there were industry pricing principles that stipulate prices should be set only to recover the actual costs they incur, and that recovery of lost profits is not a valid reason, but that ultimately, \u201clarge airports face minimal constraints on their pricing because they are effectively unregulated regional monopolies\u201d.\nAirlines are concerned that airports could seek to increase these charges in renegotiations happening not just currently, but also over coming years \u2013 a sign of how significantly the pandemic has hit industry profits.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest

search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nSims said \u201cwe would be very concerned if the major Australian airports sought to use their monopoly position to charge airlines excessive prices in order to recover any lost profits from the pandemic\u201d.\n\u201cThis could limit an already vulnerable sector\u2019s ability to recover, and impact on both consumers and the economy.\u201d\nFollowing the ACCC\u2019s warning, a Sydney Airport spokesman told Guardian Australia \u201cwe\u2019ve shared the pain fairly and equitably right through the crisis, demonstrated by the fact that we\u2019ve provided our airline partners more than $60m in relief for things like property rent and aircraft parking, and that\u2019s a principle we intend to stick to\u201d.\n\u201cThe last 18 months have been terrible for everyone in aviation, but we look forward to rebuilding the industry together,\u201d the spokesman said.\nRegarding regional travel, the ACCC found that since Virgin Australia regeared its focus after emerging from voluntary administration last year, Qantas group \u2013 which also owns budget carrier Jetstar \u2013 \u201chas further extended its dominance in regional areas\u201d.\nQantas carried 87% of passengers flying between two regional locations in June, and 70% of passengers on routes between regional airports and larger cities.\nThis lack of competition, combined with a low economies of scale on many regional routes, meant regional passengers were more likely to face higher airfares, the ACCC said.\nLast year, counter-terrorism experts criticised as \u201cludicrous\u201d a government decision to allow some regional Australian airports to remove all passenger and baggage screening to cut costs, warning there were now no measures in place to prevent extremists hijacking planes flying into cities.",

        "content": "Traces of 122 different pesticides in 12 most polluted fruit and veg products, many with links to cancer\nAlmost all grapes and oranges contain a \u201ccocktail of pesticides\u201d according to research, which has singled out the most polluted fruit and vegetables in our shopping trolleys.\nEach year, the government tests samples of groceries for chemicals to see if traces can be found in Britain\u2019s food.\nThe official figures, analysed by Pesticide Action Network (PAN), found 122 different pesticides in the 12 most polluted products, which the charity calls the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d. Many of these are hazardous to human health; 61% are classified as highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs), a concept used by the UN to identify those substances most harmful to human health or the environment.\nThe list of pesticides includes 47 with links to cancer, 15 \u201creproductive or developmental toxins\u201d that can have adverse effects on sexual function and fertility, and 17 cholinesterase inhibitors that can impair the respiratory system and cause confusion, headaches and weakness. A quarter of the pesticides found are suspected endocrine disruptors that can interfere with hormone systems, causing an array of health problems including birth defects and developmental disorders.\nEvery fruit or vegetable on the list contains two or more types of pesticide, with some containing up to 25. Although the levels of individual pesticides are within legal limits, activists fear the combination of multiple chemicals could be particularly damaging to people\u2019s health.\nNick Mole from PAN UK said: \u201cThese figures highlight the wide array of chemicals that we are exposed to daily through our diets. While safety limits continue to be set for just one pesticide at a time, the evidence is growing that chemicals can combine to be more toxic, a phenomenon known as the cocktail effect.\u201d\nThere are also gaps in the data. This year the government chose to test only three of the 12 types of fruit and vegetables from last year\u2019s dirty dozen list compiled by PAN. Strawberries, lemons and pre-packed salad, which topped the previous list, were not tested so there is no way of knowing if the amount of pesticides on these products was reduced.\nA spokesperson for PAN said there was no real way to avoid ingesting pesticides, other than campaigning for a reduction in their use.\n\u201cThe best way for people to avoid pesticides is to buy organic. Of course, almost no one in the UK can financially afford or access a fully organic diet so that is why we publish the dirty dozen \u2013 to help consumers prioritise which produce to avoid,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn terms of washing, it should remove some residues on the skin of a product (which will often be fungicides used to prevent rotting during storage and transportation). However, many modern pesticides are what are called \u2018systemic\u2019 which means that they are absorbed into the plant and distributed throughout its tissues, reaching any fruits or flowers. As a result, pesticide residues are often contained within the body of the produce itself and therefore washing the surface won\u2019t remove them.\u201d\nIt is also recommended that consumers buy from EU countries as well as the UK, as the EU has by far the most protective pesticide regime in the world and is far more likely to ban a pesticide due to concerns over the harms it causes. The UK regime currently mirrors the EU regime.\nThere are also environmental implications: half of the top 12 pesticides found are groundwater contaminants, meaning they persist in water bodies, potentially affecting aquatic biodiversity or drinking water quality. The list includes the neonicotinoid acetamiprid which, while thought to be less toxic to pollinators than other neonicotinoids, PAN says could still represent a potential threat to bee health.\nMole added: \u201cConsumers presume that their food has been through rigorous testing and that if an item is available for sale in the UK then it must be safe. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case. We actually have very limited understanding of the long-term impacts to human health of consuming small amounts of tens of different pesticides every day of our lives.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cAll food sold in the UK must meet strict rules on pesticide residue to ensure it is safe to eat. These are enforced via a comprehensive residues monitoring programme overseen by an independent specialist body and in 2020 more than 97% of tested samples were compliant.\n\u201cHowever we continue to encourage a move away from chemical pest control, and recently consulted on a national action plan which aims to minimise the impacts of pesticides and increase the uptake of safer alternatives.\u201d",

As conspicuous, charismatic creatures, butterflies get more attention than most, and yet there is still so much to discover.\nAdult butterflies usually feed on nectar, although some, such as male purple emperors, enjoy the minerals from muddy puddles and animal turds. But milkweed butterflies in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, have been discovered to feed upon live, dead and dying caterpillars.\nTo produce mating pheromones that attract females, male butterflies may supplement their diet with other chemicals. Usually these are obtained from plants but the milkweeds have been observed scratching caterpillars and apparently imbibing their juices with their proboscis.\n\u201cThe caterpillar larvae would contort their bodies rapidly in what appeared to be futile attempts to deter the scratching,\u201d said Yi-Kai Tea from the University of Sydney, who observed this never-previously-reported behaviour with colleagues.\nEven stranger is the fact that the milkweed butterflies are feeding off similar caterpillars to their offspring \u2013 not their own species but from their own subfamily.\nLike all good scientific discoveries, this \u201ckleptopharmacophagy\u201d \u2013 chemical theft \u2013 only raises further questions.\nDoes the scratching actually kill caterpillars or were the carcasses already dead?

        "content": "As the star dives into a giant glass of fizz for her first online extravaganza, she talks about this new golden age for burlesque, why the French Strictly gives her costume problems \u2013 and how #MeToo has changed her\nDita Von Teese is looking divine. Her lips are that signature red, she\u2019s wearing 1950s cat eye glasses, and her black hair falls in a thick wave across a Snow White skin \u2013 and all this on the unglamorous stage of a glitchy Zoom call. Only knowing Von Teese from her femme fatale image, her teasingly aloof burlesque performances, and her time in the tabloids as former wife of goth rocker Marilyn Manson, you might expect an icy demeanour, an impermeable mystique. So it\u2019s surprising to discover quite how normal she is: chatty, self-deprecating, not very vampish. It\u2019s easy to see traces of Heather Sweet, the \u201csuper shy\u201d girl from small-town Michigan who transformed into Von Teese.\n  The reason for our conversation is a new film, Night of the Teese, made with director Quinn Wilson and featuring some of Von Teese\u2019s classic routines alongside guest performers from male burlesque artist Jett Adore to hula-hoop virtuoso Marawa. While others rushed out online content during the pandemic, Von Teese took her time to get the details right. \u201cWhen I was watching a certain famous talkshow host doing his show from his backyard, I thought, \u2018Oh, you really do need some showbusiness,\u2019 you know?\u201d\n  Von Teese is all about the showbusiness, from the giant clam shell she emerges from in her opening routine to the finale bathing in a fizz-filled champagne coupe. It\u2019s a land of satin, ostrich feathers and diamant\u00e9 nipple pasties, with each of her many-layered outfits drenched in sparkle. \u201cI love trying to come up with the most complicated striptease costume,\u201d she smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s my speciality.\u201d\nWith her longtime creative collaborator Catherine D\u2019Lish, Von Teese is always trying to find something nobody\u2019s done before. \u201cHow do we evolve burlesque into something that it wasn\u2019t really in the golden age?\u201d she asks. \u201cBut actually, it wasn\u2019t the golden age then \u2013 it\u2019s the golden age now. We have a very empowered community which has become a place to celebrate different bodies and skin colours and politics. There are trans performers and people who are really challenging the stereotypes. It\u2019s a great time to be a burlesque dancer. In the 1940s, I would\u2019ve had to quit by the time I was 30.\u201d\n Previously Von Teese said she might stop performing when she reached 50. \u201cYeah, holy crap, I\u2019m turning 49 in a week!\u201d she laughs. On the strength of Night of the Teese, there\u2019s no reason for her to stand down. Her most captivating co-stars in the film, the voluptuous Dirty Martini and Perle Noire, are not young women, but they are gloriously entertaining, sexy and fun, and guaranteed to bring the house down. \u201cThe more examples we see of sensuality and beauty at every age the better. But I think people will always be very intimidated by women and their eroticism, especially as they get older.\u201d\n Heather Sweet grew up in a Michigan farming town, her mother a manicurist, her father a graphite machinist. \u201cI had a really nice childhood, living on a beautiful street in a little old house surrounded by lilac trees, very average,\u201d she says. They later moved to California. Heather was the middle of three sisters, the plain one (according to her), who thought the fashionable \u201cscrubbed-clean supermodel\u201d look was unattainable to her. But she loved the glamour of the 1940s, as seen in the old movies she\u2019d watch with her mum. And when she started to experiment with those styles, wearing red lipstick or vintage clothes, dying her blond hair, \u201cI had these \u2018Ah ha!\u2019 moments \u2013 I can be glamorous, I can create this mythology.\u201d\n It began as a way to counteract her shyness. \u201cI noticed people started to treat me differently, they wanted to talk to me. It made me feel a little bit stronger.\u201d And she enjoyed the sense of power? \u201cYeah! Listen, when I was 19 and first dressing in corsets and leather gloves and used to wear my hair in a Louise Brooks bob, it made me feel a little bit intimidating.\u201d\nShe worked as a go-go dancer, meeting club kids and drag queens who inspired her transformation, and at 19 went to work in a strip club. Von Teese has no issue with being called a stripper. Rather, she says, \u201cmy goal was to change people\u2019s minds about what it is to be a stripper.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t claim burlesque is superior to any other kind of stripping, \u201cBecause [the strip club] is where I really learned about what it is to be sensual, and how to do it in a way that looks effortless.\u201d\n In one old interview, Von Teese was asked about how she\u2019d changed from Heather Sweet to Dita Von Teese, and she replied that she hadn\u2019t changed at all, except in appearance. Is that really true? \u201cWell, I did change, in a way, in that I learned to assert myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep thinking about this, especially with the whole #MeToo moment.\u201d\nMany women have been coming forward about past experiences in the light of #MeToo. Earlier this year, Von Teese\u2019s former husband, Marilyn Manson, denied allegations of abuse made against him by several women. In a post on Instagram, Von Teese said the accusations did not reflect her own experiences during their seven-year relationship, and that she left Manson due to his \u201cinfidelity and drug abuse\u201d. It is her \u201csole statement\u201d on the matter.\nHow has #MeToo made her look back on her own life? \u201cWhen I was 14 or 15, I felt very preyed upon,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember working in the lingerie store and some guy comes in and tries to wrestle me to the floor, trying to pull me down behind the counter.\u201d She managed to push him off and chase him out of the shop. Sometimes the question of consent hasn\u2019t been so clear cut. \u201cI have definitely found myself thinking, \u2018What did I get myself into?\u2019 Or sometimes, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s easier to just go along with it.\u2019\n\u201cBut there are lots of things I walked away from business-wise because I wasn\u2019t willing to play the game. Even when I was a bondage model in the 90s, I had big-time boundaries. People used to say I wasn\u2019t very fun, \u2018She doesn\u2019t have drinks, she just shows up and does the job.\u2019\u201d She\u2019d take her boyfriend along for security, too. \u201cEven back then, I was very business-minded and doing my best to stay in a position of power.\u201d She has long produced and funded her own shows.\n Von Teese is aware of the complicated power dynamics around stripping. \u201cWe should not be telling people what makes them feel degraded versus empowered. It\u2019s up to the individual person. But do I think sometimes it takes a little bit longer in your life to know yourself well enough to know what\u2019s OK? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been working in a strip club at 19.\u201d\nPerhaps a performer can feel empowered, but that doesn\u2019t stop an audience viewing her body as an object? \u201cI definitely notice the times where I feel treated like a \u2018thing\u2019, and it\u2019s never when I\u2019m naked performing. It\u2019s when somebody knows I\u2019m famous but they don\u2019t know what for and they want to take a picture.\u201d She mimes leaning in for a selfie. \u201cIt\u2019s easier just to smile,\u201d she says, pursing her lips, \u201cbut that\u2019s when I\u2019ll feel objectified.\u201d\n Von Teese knows celebrities who are hounded far more than she is. She was friendly with Amy Winehouse and saw the fallout from that level of scrutiny. \u201cShe invited me over to her house so she could sing some songs for me. I remember walking in and it was just a mess.\u201d There were holes in the stairs, nothing in the fridge. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Why isn\u2019t anyone taking care of her?\u2019 I always think about her, she was so special. I felt like I wanted to protect her every time I saw her.\u201d\n Back on the subject of burlesque, we talk about the difference between the performance of sexiness and actual intimacy. \u201cThere\u2019s stage sexy and then there\u2019s the reality of who you are in the bedroom,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d Von Teese has no problem collapsing that distance. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed for people to see me without makeup on. The erotic side of me is something people don\u2019t see on stage.\u201d\nSo is she Dita Von Teese in the bedroom or Heather Sweet? She laughs. \u201cI guess a little bit of both. I have an education, if you know what I mean. And I pride myself in learning more. I always thought I knew everything about sex and then I started doing a little digging into tantra \u2013 do you know about it? I highly encourage people to discover it. It\u2019s about connecting on a deeper level with partners. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d\n Von Teese declines to comment on who she is connecting deeply with right now. In fact, she probably doesn\u2019t have time, as she is currently in intense rehearsals for France\u2019s version of Strictly, Danse Avec Les Stars. For once, she\u2019s not completely in control of her own costumes and stage routines \u2013 something she is not entirely comfortable with. \u201cI was watching a performance from last season \u2013 Pamela Anderson \u2013 and I thought, \u2018Oh my god, I hope they don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to show my body like that?!\u2019 I\u2019m not wearing any short skirts. I\u2019m not an exhibitionist!\u201d\n Despite a childhood passion for ballet, she doesn\u2019t see herself as a natural dancer. \u201cMy worst fear is looking like I\u2019m overstretching myself. Trying too hard is the kiss of death in being sexy. I beat myself up about my dance talent \u2013 and pretty much all talent. But I do know what I have. I do have something.\u201d She tilts her head. There\u2019s a little gleam in her eye, a knowing smile, and there it is.\n Night of the Teese: A Cinematic Special is streaming 1-3 October.",

        "content": "Parliamentary and presidential votes were due at the end of the year, but there are fears the interim government hopes to stay in power\nLibya\u2019s hopes of ending a decade of political chaos with credible elections at the end of this year for a president and new unified parliament have reached a defining moment, with the US insisting the vote should go ahead but some European diplomats fearing divisions are too entrenched for the result ever to be accepted as legitimate.\nThe elections are due to take place on 24 December, but no agreement has been reached within the country on laws governing the election. There are also signs that the populist interim government, theoretically appointed by the UN to manage services ahead of the elections, might seek to capitalise on the impasse to stay in power indefinitely. Thousands of foreign troops, mainly funded by Turkey and Russia, are still in place.\nThe affair threatens to become an episode of failed nation-building to sit alongside Afghanistan.\nTarek Megerisi, Libya specialist at the European council on foreign relations, said: \u201cThe difficulty is Libya has lacked any political institutions with undisputed or popular legitimacy since the General National Congress was voted into power in 2012. This creates a political arena where incumbent elites have felt empowered to shirk their constitutional responsibilities of finalising a new constitution and ending the transitional period. This means they instead focus on scrapping for absolute power and looting Libya\u2019s once considerable coffers.\u201d\nIn public, western powers are applying maximum pressure for the elections to take place.\nThe Italian foreign minister, Luigi di Maio, has warned stability throughout the region will be jeopardised if the elections do not go ahead as planned. The Libya envoy for the US, Richard Norland, insists there is no turning back from the election date. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, will also stage a conference in Paris on 12 November to maintain momentum for the vote.\nThe eastern-based Libyan parliament, known as the House of Representatives, is still discussing a law to allow parliamentary elections to proceed, two months after the initial deadline. However, without a vote, the HoR has passed a law, after months of delay, to permit elections for a president on 24 December, but this has been sent back as inadequate by the Libyan electoral commission, the body responsible for overseeing the elections and setting up an electoral roll.\nThe law has also been rejected by parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the High Council of State, effectively a rival body based in Tripoli which has a strong Muslim Brotherhood influence. The HCS wants only the parliamentary election to go ahead, but then for a referendum to be held on a constitution prior to staging presidential elections.\nTo add to the tension, the HoR last week passed a vote of no confidence in the interim government led by the prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, accusing his administration of spending 51bn Libyan dinars ($11bn) in three months without any impact on services and imposing obligations on Libya through agreements with other countries worth a further 84bn dinars. The HoR speaker, Aguila Saleh, directed the government to sign no more contracts, but Dbeibah has responded to the censure saying \u201cit was not legal, not constitutional and not moral\u201d. At a mass rally in Tripoli on Friday night, he said the HoR was full of obstructionists who only wanted war and destruction.\nDbeibah was in February the surprise choice to head a caretaker UN-backed government, but some diplomats believe he is happy to see an impasse over the elections and is using his office to try to build a popular base that will allow him to stay as interim leader if the 24 December elections are delayed. In his Tripoli speech, he highlighted an increase in teacher salaries and a \u00a35,000 gift to young bachelors seeking to marry.\nBut behind the scenes western diplomats are looking at fall-back plans, fearing that if the elections cannot happen, the process could go into a tailspin, and as a result Turkey and Russia, both with troops in Libya, will take tighter control of the oil-rich country.\nThe international community has two chief options if Libyan politicians cannot be persuaded to reach a consensus on the form of elections.\nThe most radical is for the UN to push the interim government to accept or to assert that the UN is entitled by existing security council resolutions to impose an electoral law, as some Libyan politicians are demanding.\nThe second is in effect to admit time has run out, elections cannot take place and instead embrace a fall-back Libyan stabilisation initiative being proposed by the interim government that would try again to create the conditions in the future for elections to go ahead.\nThat initiative would look at stabilisation, a permanent constitution, security sector reform and reconciliation.\nThe elections are already threatening to turn into a circus. Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army, has announced he will stand for the presidency, saying that he will take three months\u2019 leave of absence as LNA chief.\nThe possibility that Haftar could be elected as Libya\u2019s president 18 months after he was forced ignominiously to abandon a military assault on Tripoli seems remote. His move also comes as US Congress passed legislation requiring the president to investigate him for potential war crimes. In an interview with a French magazine a year ago, Haftar said Libya was not yet ready for democracy.\nMegerisi said: \u201cHaftar retains the power to intimidate but has lost standing. Prominent groups under him have rebelled or quietly refused orders, and even in his heartland of eastern Libya the notion of him as a strongman is regularly mocked.\u201d\nOther candidates are likely to be the former interior minister Fathi Bashagha and Saif al-Islam, a son of the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi. One observer said: \u201cThe difficulty with the elections is that it may come down to who pays which militia most to stuff the most ballot boxes.\u201d",

        "content": "As scientists explore how life in the abyss could generate new medicines, deep-sea mining is threatening to wipe it out\nMore in this series\n Race to the bottom: the disastrous blindfolded rush to mine the deep sea\n \u2018False choice\u2019 \u2013 is deep sea mining required for an electric vehicle revolution?\nIt has been 30 years since the last new class of antibiotic was introduced to the market. All the existing drugs are essentially variations on a theme: they kill bacteria, in similar ways. Some burst cells walls, others block DNA replication.\nBut the bacteria are swiftly evolving to survive those chemical attacks \u2013 and as they survive, they become virulent superbugs. Without new antibiotics, by 2050 the death toll from drug-resistant infections is projected to reach 10 million people a year, making the coronavirus pandemic seem almost quaint.\nThis is why scientists at Plymouth University have been searching the cold, dark abyss of the north Atlantic \u2013 where they have found sponges that contain powerful molecules capable of killing those superbugs.\nKerry Howell, professor of deep-sea ecology, and her colleagues have been carefully collecting specimens of these plant-like animals, bringing them back to the lab and testing pulverised extracts against stubborn, disease-causing bacteria. Among the deep-sea molecules, they are finding promising bactericidal novelties.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t actually know exactly what they are yet,\u201d says Prof Mat Upton, a microbiologist who leads the laboratory side of the biodiscovery programme at Plymouth. \u201cWe\u2019ve got compounds that kill bacteria that we want to try to kill, and we have a pretty good idea that they are new compounds. It is early, but things are progressing through the pipeline.\u201d\nDeep-sea mining involves retrieving mineral deposits from the area of the ocean below 200 metres down to the sea bed, which is the largest and least explored environment on Earth, occupying 65% of the planet\u2019s surface. Mining firms say that metals found there, such as copper, nickel, aluminium, lithium, cobalt and manganese, are needed to make batteries, smartphones and solar panels.\u00a0\nWhen will it happen?So far, 31 exploration licences have been granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body, and 1.5m sq km has been set aside, equivalent to an area the size of Mongolia, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as along the mid-Atlantic ridge. The decision by Nauru to trigger a rule forcing the ISA to approve a Mining Code \u2013 a set of rules \u201cto regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals in the international seabed area\u201d \u2013 will likely lead to full exploitation contracts in less than two years.\nWhy is it a problem?Mining could do huge damage to the deep sea and the creatures and ecosystems that exist there. Underwater ecosystems such as volcanic mountains, hydrothermal vents and deep-sea trenches are still poorly understood. Many endemic deep-sea species could be wiped out by the creation of a single large mine, and many other creatures will be affected by noise, light pollution and plumes of mining sediment.\u00a0\nWhat can be done?\u00a0An immediate moratorium on deep-sea mining must be instituted while scientists assess the potential damage to biodiversity, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u00a0(IUCN). Fundamentally, the IUCN also says people need to recycle and reuse products so there is less demand for extraction of natural resources. New types of batteries are also being designed that do not require metals from the sea bed.\u00a0\nChris Michael and Phoebe Weston\nThe hit rate for finding powerful and useful new compounds is proving to be especially high among animals of the deep sea. Hundreds of biologically active compounds have been found at the bottom of the ocean, some already in widespread use. Enzymes found in bacteria living around hydrothermal vents are even being used in tests for the Covid virus.\nYet novel antibiotics and an untold variety of beneficial molecules could easily be wiped out if ecosystems around vents and elsewhere on the ocean floor were to be destroyed by deep-sea mining, which could go ahead in less than two years. Even after 40 years of scientific research since hydrothermal vents were first found, a tremendous amount is still being discovered about these extreme ecosystems, which thrive in scorching, toxic waters pouring through cracks in the deep seabed, miles underwater.\nHowell says: \u201cPart of the big concern that all deep-sea ecologists have is that we know just how little is known about these areas and we are desperately trying to play catch-up with the [deep-sea mining] industry. To my mind, that\u2019s the wrong way round. We ought to be finding out about these places before we even consider mining them.\u201d\nOne of the potential targets for deep-sea mining is the south-east Atlantic abyss, where Howell is planning her next expedition, along with South African colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the least-explored parts of our planet. There\u2019s really very little data,\u201d she says .\nThey aim to visit a vast underwater mountain range, the Walvis Ridge, which stretches almost 2,000 miles between the island of Tristan da Cunha and Namibia. Deep-sea miners are eyeing up seamounts such as these for their outer crusts, which are rich in metals, including cobalt.\nHowell\u2019s team also plans to study the south Atlantic\u2019s abyssal plain, which is dotted with metallic rocky nodules similar to those in the central Pacific\u2019s Clarion Clipperton zone, now attracting feverish interest among deep-sea miners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out more about these areas, the species that live there and also what else they do for humans, one aspect of which is their potential biomedical value,\u201d says Howell.\nTheir voyage, which was first delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, then cancelled due to the funder UKRI\u2019s government-imposed budget cuts, was part of a five-year research programme, One Ocean Hub, that is seeking ways to share various benefits of the oceans equitably, encompassing environmental, socioeconomic and cultural values.\nOne aim of the collaboration between dozens of organisations worldwide is to juxtapose the oceans\u2019 easily monetised values, such as seabed mining, with the less tangible benefits, such as carbon sequestration and the hidden stash of potential new medicines.\nNatural capital economists will run models to predict how the deep sea\u2019s wildlife, mineral riches and hidden benefits interact, and how using one could put others at risk.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re interested in doing is making society aware of those trade-offs and those competing uses,\u201d says Howell. \u201cWe obviously get a lot of benefits from the ocean that we don\u2019t necessarily appreciate.\u201d\nStudies have found that up to three-quarters of deep-sea sponges and corals contain potentially useful compounds. These animals can look like trees, flowers or shrubs, and sometimes like balls of cheese on sticks. \u201cThey can\u2019t run away and they need to find ways of protecting themselves \u2013 and often it\u2019s chemical,\u201d says Rosemary Dorrington, professor of microbiology at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, and a research partner at One Ocean Hub.\nMany of these chemical defences are made by communities of microbes living inside the corals and sponges, which Dorrington likens to the human gut microbiome. \u201cThere can be up to 1,000 different species of bacteria in one sponge,\u201d she says.\nUnlike mining, expeditions such as Howell\u2019s should cause little impact on deep-sea ecosystems. Robotic submersibles developed for the offshore oil and gas industry have become the remote eyes and hands for scientists working in the deep. And only a single specimen of each species is needed. \u201cIn the old days, you\u2019d need kilograms of something to extract milligrams of a compound. Now we can detect those compounds in parts per million,\u201d Dorrington says.\nIn contrast to the search for medicines \u2013 where only a single specimen needs to be plucked from the seabed, using deep-diving submersibles originally developed for the oil industry \u2013 the likely footprint of deep-sea mining operations will be immense. Mining robots would be dispatched to scrape the tops off enormous seamounts, to gather nodules over hundreds of square miles and to demolish hydrothermal vent chimneys.\nAnimals living around vents may be especially vulnerable to mining, because many have small geographical ranges.\nBizarre snails with feet covered in armoured scales were recently classified as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list. Two out of only three known populations live on vent fields in the Indian Ocean that have been allocated mineral exploration permits, allowing mining corporations to prospect and conduct testing.\nBesides destroying habitats and species, Dorrington worries that mining operations, working on far vaster scale than scientific research, could contaminate fragile, living communities \u2013 including microbes \u2013 that have taken millions of years to evolve.\n\u201cIt would be exactly the same as if we went to Mars,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would need to be considering what we\u2019re taking with us.\u201d\nHelen Scales is author of The Brilliant Abyss, available at the Guardian Bookshop\nThis article was amended on 30 September 2021 to add that the One Ocean Hub expedition to the south Atlantic was cancelled following budget cuts at UKRI",

        "content": "Government removes costs and red tape in go-ahead for more trials of gene edited crops\nThe prospect of genetically modified foods being grown and sold in the UK has come a step closer after changes to farming regulations that will allow field trials of gene edited crops in England.\nCompanies or research organisations wishing to conduct field trials will still have to notify the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the government announced on Wednesday, but existing costs and red tape will be removed so more trials are likely to go ahead.\nThe immediate change is small, and affects only England, but the government says it will be followed by plans for new primary legislation that will allow far greater use of gene editing in crops in the UK, and a redefinition in law of genetic modification.\nThat could open the way to the sale of gene-edited crops developed in the field trials, and to further steps such as gene editing in animals, and potentially the production and sale of genetically modified organisms in the UK.\nGeorge Eustice, the environment secretary, said: \u201cGene editing has the ability to harness the genetic resources that nature has provided. It is a tool that could help us in order to tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face \u2013 around food security, climate change and biodiversity loss.\u201d\nMinisters are keen to use Brexit to allow gene editing, a form of genetic modification that is heavily restricted in the EU, to be used in the UK, despite a public consultation that found 87% of people who responded viewed gene-edited crops as a greater risk than traditional crop breeding methods.\nGene editing involves using and modifying genes already found in an organism, unlike other forms of genetic modification, which can use genes imported from other plants or animals. Gene editing can be used to mimic the effects of traditional plant breeding but is accelerated as it is done in a laboratory instead of requiring years of repeated selective breeding.\nProponents say gene editing could safely be used to develop crops with increased yields or additional nutritional benefits, or that would be resistant to pests and disease and withstand drought, high temperatures or other effects of climate breakdown.\nScientists welcomed the changes. Angela Karp, the director and chief executive of Rothamsted Research, which had a field trial for gene-edited wheat approved before the changes, said: \u201cGene editing gives us a powerful new tool to accelerate the generation of plant varieties that can potentially be more nutritious, more resilient against climate change and grown with a reduced environmental impact.\n\u201cWe look forward to building on our science in gene editing to help deliver the crops farmers will need to deliver on Cop26 emissions targets and beyond. We will now be able to scale up our field scale studies and accelerate the creation of new varieties that can future proof our farming.\u201d\nGuy Poppy, professor of ecology at the University of Southampton, also welcomed the development but said: \u201cWhile I understand why Defra propose a proportionate step-by-step process, I do fear that the travel along that path will be slow, complex and fraught with continuing claims and counterclaims.\u201d\nHowever, campaigners said the government was overriding public concern on the issue. Liz O\u2019Neill, director of umbrella group GM Freeze, said: \u201cGenetic engineering \u2013 whatever you choose to call it \u2013 needs to be properly regulated. The government wants to swap the safety net of proper public protections for a hi-tech free-for-all \u2013 but our food, our farms and the natural environment deserve better.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThis announcement is described as a response to Defra\u2019s consultation on the regulation of genetic technologies. However, no detail has been made available [at the time of writing] on what George Eustice actually learned from the exercise. The consultation submissions that GM Freeze has seen raised a wide range of concerns about Defra\u2019s proposals for dismantling GM safeguards, but this announcement suggests the minister isn\u2019t listening.\u201d\nJoanna Lewis, the director of policy and strategy at the Soil Association, said gene editing was the wrong approach and the government should instead focus on helping farmers become more sustainable.\n\u201cWhat would help is a reversal of the \u2026 lack of investment in agro-ecological, nature-friendly methods and farmer-led technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be investing in solutions that deal with the cause of disease and pests in the first place, including a lack of crop diversity, the decline in beneficial insects, and animal overcrowding. We must increase soil carbon, wildlife and animal welfare on farms to solve the climate and nature crises, and protect human health.\u201d\nGideon Henderson, the chief scientific adviser at Defra, said the government was looking closely at the implications for any changes to the UK law on GM organisms for future trade deals. The EU and some other countries impose heavy restrictions.\nEven if GM organisms and associated products were omitted from trade deals, there could be concerns that other agricultural goods could be affected \u2013 in crops, by potential cross-contamination, and in the case of meat by livestock consuming GM crops.",

While France would \u201cprepare seriously\u201d for such a phone call, its position is that it will have to be a conversation of substance.\nSince the SPA between Australia and Naval Group was negotiated there have been accusations of cost and schedule overruns.\nThe SPA is secret, but an auditor general\u2019s report has revealed it contains \u201coff ramps\u201d, or \u201cexit gates\u201d \u2013 points at which Australia could withdraw from the contract in the event of poor performance. What is not clear is what happens if that withdrawal is because of a preference for a different deal instead of a failure by Naval Group to deliver specific outcomes.\nEarly on the morning of 16 September Australia time, Morrison, in a joint virtual address with US president Joe Biden and UK prime minister Boris Johnson, announced the switch to nuclear-powered submarines.\nDefence minister Peter Dutton has said Naval Group\u2019s Attack-class submarines were no longer suited to the nation\u2019s operational needs, and that the government had been \u201cupfront, open and honest\u201d with France about its decision.\nLast week Herve Grandjean, the French Ministry of Defence spokesperson, said Naval Group received an official letter from the Australian navy saying it was \u201cextremely satisfied that performance of the French submarine was excellent\u201d on the same day the cancellation announcement was made.\nMacron has apparently snubbed Morrison\u2019s attempts to make contact in the wake of the Aukus announcement. The French ambassador to Australia was recalled to Paris and is yet to return.\nUnder the SPA, Australia will pay a \u201cbreak fee\u201d to Naval Group, but company is also planning to seek further compensation.\n\u201cWe have begun to analyse the financial and contractual consequences of this Australian sovereign decision for Naval Group,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cWe are discussing this with the Australian authorities in a constructive mindset but it is too early at this stage to give any estimation [of costs].\u201d\nFrance beat Germany and Japan to win the submarine contract with a diesel-electric version of its existing nuclear submarine, the Barracuda. France has been open to the idea of converting back to nuclear power, and Dutton says that option was considered then dismissed in favour of a submarine developed under the Aukus aegis.\nOn Wednesday, the Nine newspapers reported that Malcolm Turnbull, who was prime minister when the contract with France was inked, said the current government should have considered the French nuclear option. It has \u201csafety and non-proliferation advantages\u201d over the US and UK options, as the uranium used has a lower level of enrichment, he said.",

Which club has been managed by most World Cup winners?\u201d\nWith Brazil having won the big one five times, let\u2019s start in South America. \u201cSantos were managed by nine World Cup winners,\u201d writes Marcelo Schleder. \u201cSeven of them as players and two as managers. Aymor\u00e9 Moreira, who was in charge when Brazil became world champions in 1962, kickstarted this trend in 1952, a full decade before the pinnacle of his career in Chile.\n\u201cThree players who were both in the 1958 and 1962 squads took charge of Santos: Mauro, Pepe and Castilho. Another two only took part in the latter competition: Meng\u00e1lvio and Coutinho. Emerson Le\u00e3o and Clodoaldo became world champions in 1970, while Carlos Alberto Parreira was the manager when Brazil lifted the World Cup in 1994. From those nine, only Pepe and Le\u00e3o found success at Santos. The former was at the helm when Santos won the Paulista Championship in 1973 while the latter took the club to the Conmebol Cup (1998) and Brazilian league (2002) titles.\u201d\nChris Charlton writes: \u201cJuventus must be in with a shout. By my reckoning 10 Juventus managers won the World Cup as players.\u201d It\u2019s actually 11, as Erich Pl\u00f6chl has added Virginio Rosetta to your list:\nVirginio Rosetta (Italy 1934, Juventus 1935-39)\n   Umberto Caligaris (Italy 1934, Juventus 1939-40)\n   Giovanni Ferrari (Italy 1934 and 1938, Juventus 1941-42)\n   Luis Monti (Italy 1934, Juventus 1942)\n   Felice Borel (Italy 1934, Juventus 1942-46)\n   Luigi Bertolini (Italy 1934, Juventus 1951)\n   Aldo Olivieri (Italy 1938, Juventus 1953-55)\n   Eraldo Monzeglio (Italy 1934 and 1938, Juventus 1964)\n   Dino Zoff (Italy 1982, Juventus 1988-90)\n   Didier Deschamps (France 1998, Juventus 2006-07)\n   Andrea Pirlo (Italy 2006, Juventus 2020-21)\nThen, there\u2019s a World Cup-winning manager, Marcello Lippi (Italy, 2006) who held the reins at Juventus in two spells (1994-99, 2001-04), but he did so before winning the World Cup so whether he counts as a 12th is debatable.\nReal Madrid can perhaps lay claim to a slightly different record \u2013 the club managed by most World Cup winners from different countries. H\u00e9ctor Scarone (Uruguay 1930), Jorge Valdano (Argentina 1986), Jupp Heynckes (West Germany 1974) and Zinedine Zidane (France 1998) have all held the Bernab\u00e9u hot seat.\nOn we go and Chris Weaver details \u201cGraham French\u2019s unrivalled solo goal against Mansfield way back in 1968 \u2026 it lasted a rough minimum of 18 seconds, and probably 20 seconds or more due torrential rain and a boggy pitch, which slowed things down.\u201d If true, that would indeed rival Quillan Roberts\u2019s 19.51 seconds.\n\u201cThere were 19,315 lucky people at Kenilworth Road on 18 September 1968 to watch Luton Town v Mansfield Town. Unfortunately, the goal was never filmed though someone did record an \u2018as live radio commentary\u2019 though it is possibly too short and omits several important details.\n\u201cFrench, a mercurial genius (think Paul Gascoigne or Robin Friday) was waiting just outside the area, where he immediately started on a jinking run across the boggy surface. He beat two Mansfield players within 15 yards and set off towards the centre circle, where two defenders were waiting. He dribbled around the first, and attempted to repeat the feat when challenged by the other, only to be nearly pulled off his feet by an attempted rugby tackle.\n\u201cFrench had, however, seen him coming, and played the ball past him before contact. As French pushed the ball some yards further he found that the first defender had looped around so that he could make another challenge. By this time, it was apparent French was having no more of this nonsense, and completely fooled his opponent with a dummy, causing him to slip and fall. French approached the penalty area and, as the goalie came charging out he was too clever, slipping the ball past him and smacking it into the empty net. The whole sequence of events was breathtaking, astonishing.\u201d For further reading on French\u2019s interesting life and pseudonym, read this Knowledge from 2009.\n\u201cLiverpool and Chelsea recorded the same scoreline in their first five Premier League matches of the season (3-0, 2-0, 1-1, 3-0, 3-0). Is this a record?\u201d wonders George Jones.\n\u201cI think the answer is yes,\u201d answers Chris Roe, who has done the hard yards on this one. \u201cThe best I could find in any season in English football was a sequence of four. The longest sequence in the same division in the same season of the English league until now was Bristol Rovers and Wolves (tier two, 1990). Taking out the same division criteria, there are other instances of four, but no longer: Barnet (tier four, 2007) and Doncaster Rovers (tier three, 2007). Darlington (tier four, 1995), Oxford United (tier four, 1995), Norwich City (tier three, 1920), West Brom (tier one, 1920), Bournemouth (tier three, 1986), Preston (tier four, 1986), Halifax (tier three, 1946) and Millwall (tier two, 1946).\n\u201cI only have a small snapshot of European league data but we can find a sequence of five to match Liverpool and Chelsea from two different leagues in the same season. Mechelen (Belgium tier one, 2016) and Virtus Entella (Italy tier two, 2016).\u201d\n\u201cHas a physio ever pulled up injured while sprinting on to the pitch to treat an injured player?\u201d asked Scott Sumner in October 2016.\nLooking beyond the instance of Gary Lewin dislocating his ankle and being carried off on a stretcher after a rare moment of England celebration at the 2014 World Cup, there were a couple of other unfortunate physios. \u201cBack when Southampton\u2019s fortunes were not so good, I was at a game at Home Park, in about 2006-07, between Plymouth and Saints,\u201d recalled Philip Wood. \u201cA Saints player had pulled up with an injured hamstring and required treatment \u2026 cue the Southampton physio, who was getting on a bit. He enthusiastically came sprinting across to the far side of the pitch to where the injured player was lying and about 10 metres before he got to him started hobbling himself. He had managed to also pull his hamstring \u2013 much to the derision and merriment of the Plymouth fans. Cue a scene of the injured leading the injured.\u201d\nAnd Andrea Raffaelli mailed in to state that \u201cin September 2012, the team doctor for my home-town club Ternana tore his achilles tendon while sprinting on to treat two players, who had collided head-to-head. Talk about good deeds gone wrong. Here\u2019s a source (in Italian) that mentions the incident.\u201d\nCan any professional footballers drive a lorry?\n\u201cAs a Derby fan this has been a somewhat miserable week (although that\u2019s a sentence that applies to most weeks, to be fair),\u201d begins Mark Ward. \u201cWith the announcement of our 12-point deduction for going into administration, I was wondering whether any clubs had weathered a similar punishment without suffering relegation? And if so, with the threat of an additional nine-point deduction still hanging over Pride Park, what\u2019s the biggest points deduction a club has been given and still survived?\u201d\nWhat is the highest number of different players to play in goal for a team in one game? I'm sure three can happen from time to time, with injuries and red cards, but has there ever been four?\n\u201cWest Ham fans have been singing \u2018Bubbles\u2019 since the 1920s. Has any other English club such a long standing anthem?\u201d asks Chris Grant.\nNiche! In League One, @IpswichTown have played 5 home games; 9 goals scored (mean of 1.8 gpg) = top the division for home goals scored (no. or mean). By conventional measures tho, their home form is worst in the div.

        "content": "The respected academic, who has died aged 80, was a leading anti-caste campaigner and fought tirelessly for women\u2019s rights\nAt the village of Kasegaon, in India\u2019s rural western region of Maharashtra, huge crowds turned up for the funeral in August of a US-born, white sociologist whom many local people saw as one of their own.\nMost of the mourners were Dalits, who belong to the lowest caste in Indian society, previously deemed \u201cuntouchables\u201d.\nGail Omvedt, who had made Kasegaon her home for more than 50 years and died there aged 80, was a prominent figure in the anti-caste and women\u2019s rights movement. She championed the most marginalised in Indian society. As one scholar put it, she \u201ctruly practise[d] what feminists call prefigurative politics, ie, live by your principles\u201d.\nOmvedt renounced her US citizenship in the 1980s. She wanted to live, marry and die among the people she fought for and wrote about.\n\u201c[She] left all her US socio-cultural privilege [to] work for Indian Dalits,\u201d says Somnath Waghmare, a Maharashtra-born film-maker who worked closely with Omvedt while making a documentary about her life, which is yet to be released. \u201cIndian Dalits love and respect her by [their] hearts.\u201d\nWaghmare says about 1,000 people attended Omvedt\u2019s funeral. Her death drew media attention in India and around the world, as scholars and activists paid tribute to a sociologist who was unique in her field.\nGail Marie Omvedt was born on 2 August 1941 in Minnesota. Her PhD in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley, focused primarily on Savitribai Phule, who was known as the mother of Indian feminism, and her husband, Jyotirao Phule. The Phules, who came from Maharashtra, were among those leading the Indian anti-caste struggle and had dedicated their lives to what was known as the major non-Brahmin population.\nOmvedt, who was involved in anti-Vietnam war protests while living in the US, moved to India in the 1970s and settled in Maharashtra, marrying into a family of freedom fighters. Her husband, Bharat Patankar, is the son of activists Indumati and Krantivir Babuji Patankar. Omvedt learned to speak flawless Marathi, the local language, and also spoke Hindi.\nCynthia Stephen, Indian writer and poet, describes Omvedt\u2019s intellectual legacy as unique and unparalleled. \u201cIt begins with her own journey growing up during the civil rights movement in the US and then being inspired by her teacher to study the anti-caste people\u2019s movements in India.\n\u201cBut what is even more notable is how she was able to transcend her colour, caste, class and educational privilege, practically throw all these advantages away, and blend in with the lives of the rural working classes, the women, and the Dalits and the Adivasis, identifying with them to a degree that even most Indians didn\u2019t,\u201d she says.\nBharat Patankar and Omvedt worked on local and national causes and co-founded Shramik Mukti Dal, or Toilers\u2019 Liberation League, which started a mass social movement across India, highlighting the cause of farmers, drought-hit villages and dam-displaced communities. Omvedt dedicated most of her energy to gender and the women\u2019s movements. She was also a scholar of Buddhist philosophy.\nOmvedt was also known for her work on BR Ambedkar, the social reformer and father of India\u2019s post-independence constitution.\nStephen, who is also a gender and development policy researcher, said Indian scholarship, \u201cin thrall to both Brahminical worldviews and the powerful influence of left-oriented ideologies, mostly completely ignored the work of all anti-caste and lowered-caste thinkers and writers\u201d.\n\u201cIt was because of the work of scholars like Gail \u2026 Eleanor Zelliot and Rosalind O\u2019Hanlon that these works saw the light of day and came into the academic limelight. So the world owes a debt to these women who brought the best of intellectual traditions but also an anti-colonial perspective to the scholarship and intellectual outputs of the Dalit-Bahujan scholarship in India, most of which was largely ignored by the Indian academy.\u201d\nOmvedt wrote more than a dozen books, most notably Dalits and the Democratic Revolution: Dr Ambedkar and the Dalit Movement in Colonial India, which, says Stephen, \u201cspans two centuries of struggle by the lowered castes, right up to the last days of Dr Ambedkar\u2019s life and work\u201d.\n\u201cThis is of particular importance as it highlights the fact that the common people were very much in the vanguard of the struggle for liberation, not only from the British colonisers but also from the social, political and religious structures, which were exploiting them for generations and centuries,\u201d she says.\nPaying tribute to Omvedt, Manisha Desai, head of sociology at the University of Connecticut, says: \u201cBeyond her long term and enduring commitment, what was unique about her work from today\u2019s vantage point is how little she focused on issues of individual identities and how much she sought to understand the complexities of each group rather than see them as homogenous entities in binary opposition to each other.\u201d\nOmvedt also influenced feminism in India and globally, says Desai. \u201cIn India and internationally Gail highlighted the importance of not just colonial but also precolonial gender hierarchies as they were reinterpreted by colonial capitalism, and later postcolonial and neoliberal capitalism; the failures of nationalist movements and of the left in addressing gender justice; the importance of seeing the differences among women, even poor women, Dalit women were not undifferentiated; the importance of access to land for their material wellbeing; acknowledging women\u2019s knowledge and drawing upon local cultural traditions of protest and struggle,\u201d she says.\nDesai says Omvedt\u2019s book, Seeking Begumpura, was particularly interesting \u2013 Begumpura refers to an Indian utopia for a place with no pain.\n\u201cTo dedicate your life to a people and struggles in a land far from your own, be at once humble and write theoretically sophisticated texts, truly practise what feminists call prefigurative politics, ie, live by your principles, while you work for the revolution, are remarkable qualities that few practise. It was an honour to have met her,\u201d says Desai.\nOmvedt is survived by her husband, Bharat Patankar, her daughter Prachi, who is a US-based feminism and global justice activist, and granddaughter Niya.\nOmvedt\u2019s daughter said that from when she was a child, she witnessed her mother\u2019s deep dedication to building bottom-up social movements among ordinary people \u2013 for anti-caste, feminist and leftwing transformation.\n\u201cMy earliest memories are of sitting on her shoulders during marches and rallies through rural and indigenous areas across western India, and singing activist songs with other kids,\u201d Prachi Patankar says.\n\u201cThe living traditions of Tukaram, Savitribai Phule, BR Ambedkar, this was our everyday culture. My mum instilled in me the commitment to carry forward the legacy of this political work \u2013 linking class and gender justice, caste and racial justice, all \u2013 to carry this forward, wherever I am, throughout my own lifetime, towards the shared dream of Begumpura.\u201d",

You\u2019ve got to recalibrate when you lose. The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. It\u2019s a new day, a new dawn. Keir has his moment and I wish him the best of luck.\u201d\nLammy was asked about transgender rights after saying there were \u201cdinosaurs\u201d on the right and the left who wanted to \u201choard rights\u201d instead of recognising them for trans people. His remarks were taken by some to be a criticism of the Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who sparked a row after saying \u201conly women have cervixes\u201d and then said she felt too unsafe to attend this year\u2019s party conference.\nHowever, Lammy denied he had been talking about Duffield and criticised the BBC for asking him about the issue. \u201cYou, the BBC, are choosing to land on this subject \u2013 that most British people aren\u2019t talking about in a fuel crisis \u2013 and spend minutes on this because it keeps Labour talking about identity issues and not about the substantive policies that Keir will set out,\u201d he said.\nIn his keenly awaited speech later on Wednesday, Starmer will repudiate the legacy of Corbyn without mentioning his name, and accuse the government of being \u201clost in the woods\u201d.\nHe will put addressing Britain\u2019s mental health crisis after Covid at the heart of his pitch to voters, with a promise that a Labour government would make mental health treatment available to everyone who needs it within a month, and create drop-in mental health hubs aimed at children and young people.\nThe pledges will be set out in Starmer\u2019s first in-person address to the conference in Brighton, which he hopes will show Labour is \u201cback in business\u201d and has a programme for tackling \u201cthe chronic problems revealed by Covid\u201d.\nLabour believes the mounting fuel crisis is stoking voters\u2019 concerns about Boris Johnson\u2019s competence, with the government assailed on a number of fronts and even the Tory-leaning press accusing Downing Street of having lost its grip. \u201cThe shine has come off,\u201d said a party spokesperson.\nLammy said the prime minister had shown he was a \u201cclown\u201d who had been \u201cmissing in action\u201d while people queued at the pumps. He blamed the fuel crisis on the government for having botched the Brexit deal, which he said Labour would have to look at how to fix.\nHe told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cBrexit is responsible for some of the problems we are seeing. On this fuel crisis, there are not queues to get fuel in France, in Spain, in Germany, but there are fuel queues in our own country. That is as the result of exiting the European Union with the deal that Boris Johnson struck.\u201d\nAfter Johnson on Tuesday appealed to the public not to fill their cars with petrol unless necessary, Starmer will seek to contrast the government\u2019s chaotic approach with the scale of the challenges facing the country.\nHe is expected to say: \u201cI see the government lost in the woods with two paths beckoning. One path leads back where we came from. None of the lessons of Covid are heeded. The divisions and flaws that were brutally exposed by the pandemic all worsen.\n\u201cBut there is another path down which we address the chronic problems revealed by Covid with the kindness and the togetherness that got us through.\u201d\nHe will call mental health \u201cone of the urgent needs of our time\u201d, and promise that a Labour government would tackle it on a number of fronts.\nStarmer will be joined in the conference hall in Brighton by his wife, after spending part of their family summer holiday hammering out a first draft of his speech.\nMany colleagues regard it as a make-or-break moment for his leadership, amid concerns about whether the party has succeeded in gaining a hearing from the electorate and whether the public knows what Starmer stands for.",

But the Raiders are not ready to move away from his go-deep, \u201cJust Win, Baby\u201d legacy \u2013 and they may not ever be. Ten years on, they still wear tiny black shield-shaped stickers with AL on those lustrous silver helmets.\nHis 66-year-old son, Mark, who has owned and run the Raiders since his father\u2019s death, angered the legion of loyal fans in Oakland by bolting to Las Vegas before last season, even though he said he tried to get a new stadium built in Oakland even after the city jacked up the rent on the old one.\nSince Al Davis died in 2011, the Raiders have not been all that great, either, posting one winning season and losing their only playoff game in that span. Even after Jon Gruden, the brash coach they actually traded to a team that beat them in the Super Bowl, returned to sign a then-record, 10-year, $100m contract before the 2018 season, the best the Raiders could do was 8-8.\nBut wait. Take another look. Three games is too early to label them contenders, but the Raiders are 3-0 after a hairy 28-25 victory on Sunday over the Miami Dolphins, their second OT win this season. They have not been 3-0 since 2002, the season after Gruden, traded to Tampa Bay, beat Oakland in Super Bowl XXXVII.\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t played our best football. And I think that\u2019s a frustrating thing and an exciting thing,\u201d Derek Carr, the Raiders\u2019 veteran quarterback, said in a post-game interview with CBS on Sunday.\nThere have been several interesting developments so far in the 2021 NFL season \u2013 the Panthers, Rams and Broncos are 3-0 with new QBs \u2013 but the Raiders, tied with Denver for first place in the tough AFC West (two games ahead of Kansas City!), are holding their own and emerging from the shadows of a dreary decade.\nThey play the Chargers, last-minute winners on the road over the Chiefs, next Monday night in Los Angeles. But they still are the Raiders, the team NFL fans loved to hate long before the Patriots. They have Gruden, the animated, 58-year-old former TV analyst known by both fans and detractors as \u201cChucky,\u201d the slasher-movie character.\nWith three Super Bowl victories and 28 Hall of Famers in their history, a resurgent and relevant Raiders are good for the NFL. The Raiders have been good for the league lately, anyway, considering the way Davis and Gruden strongly supported the defensive lineman Carl Nassib in June when he came out as the NFL\u2019s first gay active player. \u201cIf he\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy,\u201d Davis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal at the time.\nThe Raiders have a long history of running ahead of the curve. Al Davis, with his Brooklyn background and his AFL roots, often scrapped with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, the league\u2019s image-maker. Davis hired Art Shell in 1989 to become the league\u2019s first Black coach in 60 years. Amy Trask, a longtime team executive, became the NFL\u2019s first female CEO in 1997.\nAllegiant Stadium in Las Vegas is state of the art and filled with fans now that the gates are open again. The Raiders have found a way to somewhat recreate the Black Hole, the sections in Oakland where the team\u2019s most rabid fans, many of them in garish costumes, congregated to back the Raiders by raising hell, even during the down years.\n(Winning them over was a project. Rob Rivera, a resident of Hayward, California, who was the president and co-founder of the Black Hole, died earlier this month from coronavirus. He never saw a game in Vegas, telling the Guardian last year, \u201cThe move has broken our hearts, pissed us off. They proved loyalty is a one-way street in the NFL.\u201d)\nCarr improved statistically in each of the last three seasons, but only had 19 victories to show for it. Carr passed for 386 yards in their ungainly, come-from-behind victory over the Dolphins, leading the Raiders to two field goals in overtime. \u201cMaybe my pregame speeches aren\u2019t very good,\u201d Gruden said afterward.\nJustin Herbert, the Chargers\u2019 superb young quarterback, will offer a more serious challenge next week than Dolphins back-up Jacoby Brissett did Sunday \u2013 as will the Broncos\u2019 Teddy Bridgewater \u2026 and, of course, the Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes. Two times each. So it gets tougher.\nBut the Raiders are enthusiastic. Gruden said again last week at a news conference that he never lacks confidence, but his players now seem to be following his lead and winning games they might not have won in seasons past.\nThe Raiders brought with them to Las Vegas something called the Al Davis Memorial Torch, which is lit, usually by a former player or coach, before each home game to pay tribute to his belief that \u201cthe fire that burns brightest in the Raiders\u2019 organization is the will to win.\u201d It sounds, at least so far this season, that the team does not really need the torch.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how me and Gruden are, man,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe always talk about, \u2018Man, do we have to leave?\u2019 We have so many plays; we have so many things we want to do. You\u2019re like, \u2018Can we play a doubleheader?\u2019 I don\u2019t know if our bodies would be able to hold up, but our minds are sure willing.\u201d",

Next prepaid for the majority of this year\u2019s cargo so the squeeze only affected about 15% of shipments. Nonetheless this had pushed up average selling prices by 2% in the second half of the year with household goods hardest hit.\nWolfson said the cost price inflation would continue in the first half of 2022 to average 2.5% with the price tags for fashion and homeware rising 1% and 6% respectively. \u201cWe anticipate cost price inflation to rumble on through most of next year, albeit at levels that are not overly worrying,\u201d he said.\nHis comments came as the FTSE 100 reported pre-tax profits of \u00a3346.7m for the six months to 31 July, a figure that was 6% higher than two years ago.

The agreement is subject to the approval of the parliamentary groups of both parties.\nDr Adenauer\u2019s Christian Democratic Party lost its absolute majority in the federal elections last month. Immediately after the election the Free Democrats refused to serve in a coalition under Dr Adenauer, but later their leader, Dr Erich Mende, said they might accept him as chancellor for a limited term. Informed sources said tonight that Dr Adenauer would send a letter to the Free Democrats dealing with how long he intended to hold office in the coalition.\nFrom Terence Prittie\n  23 October 1961\nA special Free Democratic Party meeting called yesterday in Bonn decided by a substantial majority in favour of the proposed coalition with the Christian Democrats, under the chancellorship of Dr Adenauer. This decision has today been communicated to the federal President, Herr Lubke, and will be confirmed on Tuesday by the Bundestag members of the party. The way should then be clear for the formation of the new government by the end of the week.\nThe only important issue left to be decided in the formation of Dr Adenauer\u2019s fourth Government is who is to be foreign minister. Only after misgivings have the Free Democrats dropped their objections to Dr Adenauer\u2019s becoming chancellor again, and there is to he a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d under which he will resign before the end of the four-year term, probably in 1963.\nFrom Terence Prittie\n 8 November 1961\nDr Adenauer was re-elected federal chancellor this evening by the new Bundestag, which was itself elected on September 17. His overall majority was only a small one, for he received 259 votes out of a total of 499 members: there were nine absentees.\nThe slenderness of his majority is the latest of a number of indications that his fourth Government will not be a strong one. Between them the Christian Democrats and Free Democrats have 308 members in the Bundestag, and today only seven of them were absent. This means that 43 members of the two parties either voted against Dr Adenauer or abstained, and this in spite of their parties having pledged themselves to accept him after seven weeks of intensive negotiations.\nThe Social Democrats declared today that the agreement on which the new coalition of Christian and Free Democrats is based is unconstitutional. They consider that various clauses bind members of both parties in a manner which is not consonant with the freedom and individual responsibility of members of the Bundestag. In particular the agreement not to accept any offer of coalition by the Social Democrats means that a vote of no confidence in an un unsuccessful chancellor is rendered virtually impossible.\n8 November 1961\nDr Adenauer\u2019s re-election as chancellor of Western Germany has ended the interregnum of the past seven weeks, but it is unlikely to end the political instability created by the ambiguous election results in September. On paper, a coalition of the Free Democrats and the Christian Democrats should command about three hundred votes in the Bundestag. In fact, Dr Adenauer\u2019s vote was only 259 \u2013 a bare nine votes above the minimum necessary to elect. It seems fairly clear that many Free Democrats in the Bundestag must have refused to vote for Dr Adenauer, in implicit defiance of their own party leader. The outcome, whatever one may think of Dr Adenauer and Dr Mende as individuals, could scarcely be more unfortunate for Germany or for the western alliance.\nA weak government in Western Germany is a potential danger to her allies as well as to herself. The most obvious form which this danger may take is a continuation of the bickering and intriguing which delayed the formation of the new government for so long. \u201cEngland,\u201d Disraeli once said, \u201cdoes not love coalitions.\u201d In fact, no country loves them. Ministers in a coalition government frequently have to spend more energy in defending themselves from ambitious rivals than in administering their departments. When the partners to the coalition disagree on policy and are not united by personal loyalty to their chief, these consequences are apt to be intensified. However, responsible opinion in West Germany is clearly anxious that Bonn should not repeat the experience of Weimar.\nA more serious danger is that the new government may be unwilling to make any constructive moves in foreign policy for fear of endangering its uncertain hold on the Bundestag. It is true that the resignation of Herr von Brentano has been interpreted in some quarters as a sign that the blank rigidity of the Adenauer era will soon be over. Unfortunately, however, it is by no means clear that the Free Democrats (or for that matter the Social Democrat opposition) are more flexible in their approach to negotiations with the Soviet Union than the CDU.",

government\u2019s assessment of the proposed raising of the Warragamba dam wall as \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d and called for alternatives, such as buying back houses in flood-prone areas, to be considered.\nThe minister for western Sydney, Stuart Ayres, said the long-awaited environmental impact statement (EIS), published on Wednesday, would give the community \u201ca full understanding of what is proposed\u201d and the potential environmental impacts of raising the wall by up to 17 metres.\nThe general public has been given 45 days to make submissions in response to the 4,000 pages of documents.\nWaterNSW has proposed raising the dam wall to mitigate the risk to human life and to property in the flood plain of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment in the event of a major flood.\nBut the plan, which would see flood waters temporarily held inside the Blue Mountains world heritage area and then released in a controlled way, has faced strong opposition because of the effects it would have on threatened species, cultural heritage sites and the outstanding values of the world heritage area.\nThe EIS states the project would significantly reduce the risk of flood exposure to thousands of vulnerable people and their homes and that raising the wall would give emergency services more time to prepare and safely evacuate people.\nIt estimates about 300 hectares (740 acres) of the world heritage area would be affected in a major flood event.\n\u201cImportantly, the upstream impacts of the proposal must be carefully measured against the social, economic and environmental impacts flooding can have on downstream communities in western Sydney,\u201d Ayres said on Wednesday.\nBut environment groups, experts and an MP said the potential effects of the project had been understated at multiple stages in the 86 documents.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nJamie Pittock, a professor of environmental policy at the Australian National University, said the damage the project could cause for wildlife, including the critically endangered regent honeyeater, had only been assessed for a portion of the potential inundation zone.\nThis was because WaterNSW had only examined the impacts of inundation for about 7.5 metres of the wall-raising project \u2013 instead of its full height \u2013 commencing at 2.78 metres above the full water level in the current dam.\nHe said required offsets had also only been calculated for this portion of the project.\n\u201cThe government is trying to pretend that the area of the environmental impact is much less than it actually would be by carving out land at the bottom and the top of the inundation range,\u201d Pittock said.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is reduce the offset costs, which are huge and potentially of a similar magnitude to the costs of building the dam.\u201d\nPittock has described the project as unjustified and called on the government to consider alternatives such as buying back houses on the lower flood plain.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and

farce\u201d.\nThe foundation has campaigned against the project and on Wednesday pointed to the low survey effort undertaken for significant species including the koala and the platypus \u2013 issues the federal environment department also highlighted in earlier drafts of the assessment.\n\u201cLast year the commonwealth environment department expressed the view that the dam project was likely to have \u2018extensive and significant impacts\u2019 on the national and world heritage values of the Blue Mountains,\u201d Burkitt said.\n\u201cNothing has changed.\u201d\nChris Gambian, of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said: \u201cThe impacted areas have been massively underestimated, which is unsurprising considering the half-hearted way in which assessments were conducted.\u201d\nKazan

He was in obvious pain, leaving the stadium with a knee brace on his right leg, and Mikel Arteta warned that \u201cit doesn\u2019t look very positive\u201d. Now Arsenal have confirmed that Xhaka has \u201ca significant injury to his medial knee ligament\u201d, although it will not require surgery and he will begin his rehabilitation immediately.\nThe timing is cruel for Arsenal and Xhaka, who was outstanding on an afternoon that was seen as a benchmark for Arteta\u2019s side. He had just returned from a three-match suspension and dominated the midfield alongside Thomas Partey, marking the latest turnaround in his fortunes in north London after he had seemed likely to depart in the summer.\nGoing by Arsenal\u2019s timescale, Xhaka would miss their next 14 Premier League games. It means Albert Sambi Lokonga, the impressive recent arrival from Anderlecht, is likely to receive more opportunities, although Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Mohamed Elneny are other options. Arteta may also choose to play Partey as a lone deep midfielder, as he did when Arsenal won at Burnley this month. They are next in action on Saturday, when they visit sixth-placed Brighton in search of a fourth straight win.",

        "content": "The Australian dancer allows himself to be dominated on his own terms in a duet bursting with pride \u2013 and he\u2019s never felt more free\n\u2018I grew up being told my body was wrong,\u201d says Dan Daw. \u201cAnd being told by medical professionals that my body had to be fixed. I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a dancer.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t true at all.\nBorn disabled \u2013 he identifies as \u201ccrip\u201d, reclaiming the word, and prefers not to detail his condition \u2013 Daw, 38, grew up in an outback town in South Australia and showed a talent for performing from a young age (his grandmother was a dance teacher). During a drama degree in Adelaide, Daw discovered that working with his body was what made him buzz, which led him to dance, to the UK, to Candoco dance company and then to making his own honest and autobiographical performances, the latest of which is The Dan Daw Show.\nDespite his certainty that his body was his best creative tool, Daw has been on a real journey with it. \u201cI\u2019ve had to pull apart and rebuild the relationship I had with my body,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m only in the past couple of years starting to really find the joy in my body, because I still felt an immense amount of shame.\u201d The Dan Daw Show is about him finding a way to own what he calls his \u201cmessy\u201d body, \u201cand finding my crip joy inside that\u201d.\nThe medium Daw uses to illustrate this joy is kink. You might know it as BDSM, a term for sexual practices that go beyond vanilla and are often misunderstood. What kink absolutely isn\u2019t is Fifty Shades of Grey, says director Mark Maughan, who created the show with Daw (whom he calls a \u201crare talent\u201d of great integrity, humour and generosity of spirit). \u201cI think people associate it with violence, pain, trauma,\u201d he says, whereas in reality kink practices are about \u201ccare, interdependence and communication\u201d. \u201cKink is about asking for what you need and not being ashamed of that, celebrating the things that we know we desire. That level of connection and communication with another human being is pretty special,\u201d says Maughan. \u201cWhen you feel that, it\u2019s something incredible.\u201d\nIn the case of The Dan Daw Show, this is illustrated in a duet with the non-disabled dancer Christopher Owen, where Daw allows himself to be dominated completely on his own terms. It\u2019s about Daw being able to drop his armour, since in the outside world he never lets himself be seen as vulnerable. \u201cMy guard is up all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIs someone going to point and laugh at me, or try and trip me up? Am I going to be infantilised today? Is someone going to speak really loudly at me? Is somebody going to invite me to come to their church because god can heal me? I even get people asking me if I\u2019m homeless. The pity look. What have you got for me today, world?!\u201d\nOnly really on stage, and during sex, can Daw be unapologetic about inhabiting his body, he says. It\u2019s easier for him to ask for, and get, what he needs in the bedroom than in the outside world. \u201cThere\u2019s a line in the show where I say, \u2018I wish I could feel this free all of the time\u2019,\u201d says Daw. \u201cThe level of care involved in kink practices is beautiful. If we could have that same level of care and respect and consent with each other when we\u2019re on the rush-hour tube in the morning we could build ourselves an incredible world.\u201d\nPerforming is also a space where Daw can rewrite the power dynamic between himself and a mostly non-disabled audience. \u201cYou can look at me, stare at me, but at the end you\u2019re going to clap, you\u2019re going to love me,\u201d he says, smiling at the idea of \u201cpeople enjoying my body and paying money to see my body\u201d. \u201cHere in my space I\u2019m consenting to Chris dominating me in a way that gives me pleasure and sets my body free, and there\u2019s a real power in that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m using a non-disabled body to give me what I need, so it speaks to allyship in a brilliant way, and that there\u2019s more that non-disabled people can be doing for disabled people in the world.\u201d\nWhen Daw is in control of the narrative in the theatre, some of that long-held shame can be overcome and turned into power and pride. \u201cAfter years of hating my body and rejecting my body, with this show I\u2019m celebrating my body for the first time,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s liberating in the most spectacular way.\u201d\nThe Dan Daw Show is at the Lilian Baylis Studio, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 30 September-1 October.",

Sign up here\nWe\u2019re one month in to the blockbuster trial of Elizabeth Holmes, founder of blood testing startup Theranos, and it shows no sign of releasing its grip on the public imagination. Dozens of members of the media, myself included, have lined up each week since 31 August outside a crowded courthouse in San Jose, California, to bear witness to the justice process surrounding the company and its downfall \u2013 which has been called \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s biggest fraud\u201d.\nAnd despite extensive media coverage of the rise and collapse of the blood testing firm starting as early as 2015, much of what we are learning at the trial is new, as prosecutors seek to answer a question central to the case: what did Holmes know, and when did she know it?\nHere is what we have heard in court so far about Theranos and Holmes, who faces 12 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, from the testimony of witnesses. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison.\nHow high-profile investors were allegedly fooled by Theranos\nTheranos gained fame (and eventually notoriety) for the large number of high-profile and high-net-worth individuals the company attracted as investors, including the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former US secretary of state George Shultz. The trial heard testimony from its first such investor this week when the former US defense secretary Jim Mattis testified on the stand.\nMattis told how he was taken with Holmes \u2013 whom he called \u201cyoung Elizabeth\u201d in emails \u2013 and revealed that he personally invested $85,000 in the company in January 2014. He said he was inspired by potential use of the blood testing technology for the military and on the battlefield.\nHowever, Mattis ultimately lost faith in Holmes and Theranos after negative press about the company began to emerge. \u201cThere just came a point where I didn\u2019t know what to believe about Theranos anymore,\u201d he said.\nLab workers say Theranos cherry-picked data\nA number of lab workers at Theranos have testified thus far, including former lab associate Erika Cheung. She spoke about the large rate of inaccuracy in Edison devices, the flagship technology touted by Theranos, saying they regularly failed quality control analyses. Executives would then encourage scientists to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d and manipulate data to make the results seem more accurate than they were, she said.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have about the same luck flipping a coin as to whether your results were right or wrong,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cIt was concerning to see this degree of failure, this was not typical for a normal lab.\u201d\nA star witness for the prosecution, Cheung became a whistleblower when she acted as a primary source for the Wall Street Journal story that first cast doubt on the company\u2019s capabilities in 2015. She has since been vocal about her experiences at Theranos, giving a Ted Talk on the topic and founding Ethics in Entrepreneurship, a watchdog nonprofit focusing on startups.\n\u201cIt was starting to get very uncomfortable and very stressful for me to work at the company,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cI was attempting to tell as many people as I could but it was just not getting through to people.\u201d\nCheung told the court that she raised concerns to \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, Theranos co-president and former romantic partner of Holmes, who pressured her to quit if she could not continue her role without speaking up about these issues. She also testified that she told Shultz, a former US secretary of state and Theranos board member, about her doubts.\nIn addition to Cheung, jurors heard testimony from former Theranos scientist Surekha Gangakhedkar, who said she quit the company over concerns it was rushing to launch a partnership with Walgreens without proof the machines actually worked. \u201cI was not comfortable with the plan they had in place, so I made a decision to resign and not continue working there,\u201d she told jurors.\nLater, former lab director Adam Rosendorff also testified he quit the company in late 2014 because he felt pressured to vouch for tests he did not think were accurate, causing him \u201ca lot of emotional discomfort\u201d.\nFormer employees started preserving emails ahead of investigations\nRosendorff told the court that when he plotted his escape from Theranos he defied his non-disclosure agreement with the company to forward himself emails and documents. He said he anticipated a government investigation of the firm and wanted to protect himself against potential prosecution.\nHe was not alone. Gangakhedkar, another former scientist who testified at the trial, claimed she did the same after Holmes ignored her concerns about launching machines when they were still showing inaccurate results. \u201cI was scared things would not go well,\u201d said Gangakhedkar.\nIn addition to Mattis and the scientists, we saw the first testimony from a customer of Theranos in recent days \u2013 a woman who the court heard was falsely told she was miscarrying due to an inaccurate Theranos blood test.\nWe are likely to see far more such witnesses as the trial goes on, as fewer than 10 of the 182 total potential witnesses listed by the government ahead of the trial have spoken so far.\nAbout those texts \u2026\nPerhaps the most salacious details to emerge this week were a number of text messages between Holmes and Balwani read in court. In some, Holmes appears to wax poetic to Balwani \u2013 with whom she was romantically involved \u2013 to which Balwani responds uninterestedly.\nHolmes: \u201cYou are the breeze in desert for me.\n\u201cMy water.\n\u201cAnd ocean.\n\u201cMeant to be only together tiger.\u201d\nBalwani: \u201cOK\u201d\nhttps://t.co/TezGhSCqTH pic.twitter.com/k1BnVhjbGJ\nThe text messages are just a selection from a large trove that have been submitted as evidence so far. In another, Holmes tells Balwani, \u201cMadly in love with you and your strength.\u201d\nRomantic poems aside, the messages heard in court so far seem to paint a picture of partners who were both involved in the running of Theranos. Holmes is anticipated to lean on a defence that the fraud operations were largely driven by Balwani.\nAccording to the messages heard in court, Balwani in April 2015 repeatedly stressed to Holmes that he was worried she was over-promising Theranos results \u201cwithout solid substance which is lacking right now\u201d.\n\u201cIt is most maddening there is no focus in any chem teams and no product coming out,\u201d he said days later, to which Holmes responded: \u201cI know.\u201d\nWith the bulk of Holmes defence still to come, there\u2019s plenty more to play out in front of an eager audience. The proceedings are anticipated to last through December 2021.\nIf you want to read the complete version of this newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.",

The move is dictated by very intolerant and intrusive religious and cultural beliefs,\u201d said Kamau Ngugi, the executive director of Defenders Coalition, an umbrella group of rights organisations and activists.\nThe film classification body said last week that the film \u201cblatantly\u201d violated the country\u2019s laws that penalise all forms of homosexuality or same-sex marriage, and that the storyline was a \u201cclear and deliberate attempt by the producer to promote same-sex marriage as an acceptable way of life\u201d.\nIt said the film sought to influence viewers to believe that the \u201colder generation that was once against LGBTQ+ is slowly buying into the practice and accepting same-sex marriage\u201d.\nKenyan law criminalises anyone who engages in what it terms as \u201ccarnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature\u201d. If convicted, people face up to 14 years in prison. The Kenyan constitution states that marriage is a union between two people of opposite genders.\nThe government also called the film blasphemous to the Christian faith. Two young men are shown conducting a religious service, which was \u201can attempt to use religion to advocate same-sex marriage\u201d, the government said.\nHowever, Toni Kamau, one of the film\u2019s producers, said the ban is an affront to the freedom of speech enshrined in the country\u2019s constitution. She said she was \u201cdeeply saddened by the discriminatory language used by the government to describe the experiences of people who allowed us into their lives\u201d.\n\u201cWe believe that this is a bigger conversation about freedom of expression. Everyone has the right to share their lived experience, their truth. We love character-driven documentaries that give insight into people\u2019s lived experiences,\u201d said Kamau.\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be a Kenyan religious man in a country that criminalises your love? We thought that it was important to share this story because it is a Kenyan story.\u201d\nThe government has warned that anyone who attempts to \u201cexhibit, distribute, broadcast or possess\u201d the film in Kenya will be met \u201cwith the full force of the law\u201d.",

Comedy stages are not exactly teeming with sexagenarian women; she has the territory pretty much to herself. And it\u2019s a fertile comic landscape, as this touring show about Nordic walking poles, bowel screening and \u201cknitting jerseys for the robo-hoover\u201d makes abundantly clear. But one might also regret the show\u2019s heavy reliance on familiar ageing tropes, because it undercuts Eclair\u2019s stated refusal to be defined by turning 60, and because it plays to the gallery of her assumed crowd. \u201cHow many Breton tops have we got?\u201d she opens by asking, and all that follows is pitched squarely at an audience very like Eclair herself.\nHappily, she appears undiminished by entry into her seventh decade, notwithstanding repeated references to bodily and mental decay. Eclair is on ebullient form here, overbrimming with gossip from 60\u2019s frontline, where you look in the mirror and see Angela Merkel; where sex feels as dutiful as making your own pastry. Any associations between later-life and decorum are swiftly dispelled: one routine begins: \u201cDo you remember all the wanking we used to have to do?\u201d, and the show is well lubricated with jokes about the dryness of the sixtysomething vagina.\nThey\u2019re easy hits, these gags about collapsing bodies and the sex lives of the no-longer-young, and tend to reinforce rather than up-end cliches. And, in this 90-minute outing, Eclair does lay on thick her supposed identity as a decrepit old biddy. Or Grumpy Old Woman \u2013 there\u2019s a bit of that shtick, too. Both are contradicted by the ample evidence of a sharp and joyous comic mind, as with her lovely story of a distracted experience on a zip-wire in Wales, or her transposition on to late middle-age of a glamorous seduction technique she sees on TV.\nThen there\u2019s the more intimate material about her nonagenarian parents, which offsets the broad old-age comedy with something more from-the-heart. Finally, Eclair embraces 60 as \u201cone of life\u2019s sweet spots\u201d, and in this show \u2013 in spirit, if not always in her material \u2013 she\u2019s a great advert for it.\nJenny Eclair: Sixty! (FFS) is now touring.",

Three of those picks came in a single game against Brady. He has played in 139 regular-season games with the Seahawks (2011-2017) and 49ers (2018-20). He has also played 15 playoff games.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to see,\u201d Arians said of his prior conversations with Sherman. \u201cJust a matter of I coach the ones we got and let [Licht] handle the rest of that. We\u2019ll kick the tires on some other guys, too. ... If it\u2019s the right fit, we\u2019ll move on it.\u201d\nSherman\u2019s former teams \u2013 the Seahawks and 49ers \u2013 also made contact with Sherman, he said, as did the Carolina Panthers.\nTampa Bay cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting suffered an injury in Week 1 and was placed on injured reserve with a dislocated elbow. His replacement, Jamel Dean, left last week\u2019s loss to the Rams in the first quarter with a knee injury.\nSherman pleaded not guilty to five misdemeanor charges in mid-July following his arrest for allegedly attempting to break into his in-laws\u2019 house. Sherman was charged with driving under the influence, resisting arrest, endangering roadway workers and two domestic violence counts \u2013 second-degree criminal trespass and third-degree malicious mischief. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for Friday in Washington. Sherman, 33, has been in therapy since the incident, according to NFL Network.",

Early investigations show they may have suffocated before becoming frozen by the leaked liquid nitrogen, which is stored at temperatures below -196C\nThe men, one of whom had only recently started the job and was undergoing training, worked for a company that transports liquid nitrogen. Prosecutors in Milan have launched an investigation into possible manslaughter.\nSix other people died in workplace accidents across Italy, including two workers falling to their deaths from scaffolding, on what the Italian media described as \u201cblack Tuesday\u201d, while on Wednesday morning a man was killed by a heavy vehicle as he carried out roadworks on a motorway near Bari.\nThere were 677 workplace deaths between January and July, according to reports in the Italian press, prompting calls from unions for the swift implementation of tougher safety measures and for the immediate closure of companies that fail to comply.\nThe issue entered the political debate in May, when a 22-year-old woman died after becoming entangled in a rolling machine at a textiles factory near Prato, Tuscany. She died days after Italy marked International Workers\u2019 Day.\nIn February, a man was killed after being crushed in a press at a textiles factory, also in Tuscany.\nDuring a speech in August, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said: \u201cAmong all the problems there is one thing that is dear to us all, to me in particular, and that is to try and do something to improve the unacceptable situation in terms of safety at work.\u201d\nDraghi said on Monday he had reached an agreement with trade unions to tighten safety regulations as well as hire thousands of new health and safety inspectors.\nLuigi Sbarra, the secretary of the Cisl workers union, said the implementation of measures needed to be accelerated. \u201cCondolences and condemnation are not enough,\u201d he added.\nRecent workplace accident victims included a 39-year-old man who died after falling through a garage attic during restoration work on a property in Lecce, Puglia, a 48-year-old man who was crushed to death by a machine at a factory in Florence, and another man, aged 54, who was crushed by slabs at a marble laboratory.",

        "content": "Country is implementing power rationing as supplies dwindle due to price raise of imported coal\n\nThe situation is widespread. In recent days, factories in 20 of China\u2019s 31 provinces have suffered a loss of power, forcing many to shut down production, at least for hours at a time. Millions of households in the north-east of the country have also lost power and found that they cannot use electricity to heat or light their homes.\nThe US carmaker Tesla, which has a large factory in China, is among many industrial firms that have been put on notice of longer shutdowns next week as the lack of electricity becomes acute in some regions. Most analysts believe it could take several months for the Chinese authorities to get a grip and match energy production with rising demand.\nNo, there is the capacity to generate electricity. Since the beginning of the year electricity production has increased by about 10% as the economy has bounced back from the pandemic. It\u2019s just that the Chinese energy juggernaut has run out of steam after running down stocks of coal apparently in the hope that either Beijing would lift all environmental restrictions that increase the cost of producing electricity with coal or that world prices would fall. While Beijing has eased some emissions targets, world prices have carried on soaring.\nEnergy companies are, in effect, rationing electricity to industrial and domestic users under orders from president Xi Xinping\u2019s officials to not pass on the higher costs from rising prices of imported coal.\nChina has dramatically reduced its reliance on coal consumption since 2017, cutting back the proportion used to generate electricity from more than 80% to 51.8% in 2019. Renewable energy, including wind and solar, has made up most of the difference. But with more than half of all electricity still made using coal, generators remain heavily reliant on the black stuff.\nIt is the world\u2019s largest importer of coal ahead of India. Coal prices have soared in recent months in response to rising demand. The situation is made worse for China by a spat last year with Australia over Canberra\u2019s call for an international probe of the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing imposed an unofficial ban on imports from Australia, the world\u2019s second largest exporter, making it more dependent on higher priced coal from domestic suppliers and elsewhere.\nBeijing is concerned that higher energy prices will spark an increase in inflation that in turn will depress living standards and cause social unrest. China expert and head of Enodo Economics, Diana Choyleva, said higher inflation had the capacity to hurt all household finances and unify opposition to Xi. Rationing in the worst affected areas of the north-west is preferable to a broader price increase, she said.\nChoyleva said Xi was also concerned that his administration\u2019s plans to decarbonise Chinese heavy industries and reduce pollution would be derailed by allowing energy firms to keep making electricity with dirty coal. Controls on emissions have raised energy production costs and meant that many producers will be making a loss, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. Recent moves to ease emissions targets have had little effect on the overall situation, he said.\nChoyleva says Xi\u2019s centralising zeal means regional governments have come under closer control from Beijing and resulted in a series of crises. A clampdown on bank lending led to the near collapse of several banks and earlier this month, pushed the property giant Evergrande close to insolvency. \u201cIt used to be that a crisis came up every couple of years and was dealt with. Now they are coming thick and fast,\u201d she said. Evans-Pritchard said Xi\u2019s determination to hurry through reforms forcing businesses to conform more closely to Beijing\u2019s policy agenda is causing problems. \u201cOne broader takeaway is that the current disruption highlights the economic costs inherent in China\u2019s push for self-sufficiency and decoupling with the west,\u201d he said.\n This article was amended on 14 October 2021 to clarify that, while the proportion of China\u2019s electricity generated by coal has decreased since 2017, the overall consumption of coal for this purpose has not reduced as an earlier version said.",

        "content": "Widely expected decision hailed as victory for Western Saharan independence movement\n\nA European court has struck down the EU\u2019s trade and fishing deals with Morocco because they were agreed without the consent of the people of Western Sahara.\nThe vast territory on Africa\u2019s Atlantic coast was annexed by Morocco in 1975 after the withdrawal of Spain, the colonial power, in a move largely unrecognised internationally and opposed by the Polisario Front, which fought a 16-year guerrilla war against the kingdom.\nIn a victory for the independence movement, the EU\u2019s general court annulled a decision by EU ministers to sign off the trade and fisheries deals with Morocco that included Western Sahara, but said they would remain in place as \u201cannulling them with immediate effect could have serious consequences on the European Union\u2019s external action and call into doubt legal certainty\u201d.\nThe EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, now has to chart a way out of the diplomatic fix that has split the bloc for more than a decade. While the former north African colonial powers, France and Spain, tend to favour the claims of Morocco, which regards Western Sahara as an integral part of its territory, Sweden and Germany have shown more sympathy to the cause of the Sahrawi people.\nA UN-brokered ceasefire in 1991 ended the Polisario Front\u2019s guerrilla war against Morocco, but a promised independence referendum has never taken place.\nReacting on Twitter to the ruling, Oubi Bachir, the Polisario Front\u2019s ambassador to Europe, who brought the case, hailed a great victory for the Sahrawi people.\nThe court\u2019s decision was widely expected as it reflects previous rulings. In 2016 and 2018, the court said earlier versions of the trade and fisheries agreements only applied to Morocco and not the natural-resource rich Western Sahara.\nThe EU sought a way around these rulings by revising the trade and fisheries deals, following consultations with self-declared representatives of the Sahrawi people. But the court, which said it recognised the Polisario Front as the representative of the people of Western Sahara, concluded EU authorities \u201ccannot be regarded as having secured the consent of the people in Western Sahara\u201d.\nThe effective order to rework the deals would have the biggest impact on Spain, whose fishing fleets enjoy a lucrative trade from the waters off the Western Saharan coast. In 2018, 94% of EU catches under the Morocco fishing deal came from Western Saharan waters, according to the trade body Europ\u00eache.\nEU officials are also nervous about a diplomatic fallout with Rabat at a time when they are seeking greater help from Morocco in curbing irregular migration into Europe.\nIn a joint statement, Borrell and Morocco\u2019s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, said they would take necessary steps \u201cto ensure the legal framework which guarantees the continuity and stability of trade relations\u201d between the two sides.\nDonald Trump\u2019s US administration in December 2020 became the first western country to recognise Moroccan sovereignty in a deal aimed at normalising relations between Israel and Morocco.\nThe territory remains on the UN\u2019s decolonisation list of \u201cnon-self-governing territories\u201d, meaning its roughly half a million people are still not running their own government.",

        "content": "Discovery along with another species enhances island\u2019s reputation as Europe\u2019s best place to find dinosaurs \nThe fossilised remains of a dinosaur, nicknamed \u201cthe horned crocodile-faced hell heron\u201d, have been unearthed on the Isle of Wight.\nThe 125m-year-old predator had a 9 metre-long body, powerful claws, a gigantic skull covered in horns and bumps, and long crocodile-like teeth. The fearsome creature lived on the fringes of ancient floodplains where it would have lain in wait for aquatic prey, research suggests.\nScientists say the discovery, along with the skeleton of a second species at the same site, offers unique insights into how the Spinosauridae family of dinosaurs made the transition from land-dwelling to semi-aquatic predators over a period of tens of millions of years.\n\u201cThis is a really exciting piece of news for the dinosaur world as these are some of the most charismatic and enigmatic predators,\u201d said Neil Gostling of the University of Southampton, who supervised the project.\nThe new finds also cemented the Isle of Wight\u2019s status as the best place in Europe to find dinosaurs, he added.\nThe first specimen has been named Ceratosuchops inferodios, which translates as the \u201chorned crocodile-faced hell heron\u201d, with the second specimen, Riparovenator milnerae, named \u201cMilner\u2019s riverbank hunter\u201d, in honour of the late British palaeontologist Angela Milner.\nDuring the Early Cretaceous period, the Isle of Wight was a floodplain with a Mediterranean-like climate, balmy forest and rivers containing fish, sharks and ancient crocodiles. Scientists believe the two dinosaurs would have lived at the margins of the waterways and probably hunted in the water and on land.\nThe \u201chell heron\u201d fossil revealed a long muzzle and cylindrical teeth, rather than the sabre-like blades that are normally seen in terrestrial carnivores such as T rex. This anatomy suggests it may have hunted like a modern-day heron, standing motionless in the water before plunging its jaws downwards at the sight of prey, according to the analysis published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\u201cThe fact they have these crocodile-like teeth, which are good for catching slippery fish, means we suspect they were standing in the water and using their jaws to hunt,\u201d said Gostling.\nAnother possibility is that the dinosaurs would have waited, semi-submerged, like a crocodile, or used their large claws to hook fish out of the water like a bear.\nThe haul of bones were discovered on the beach near Brighstone over a period of several years by fossil collectors Brian Foster, from Yorkshire, and Jeremy Lockwood, a retired GP who lives of the Isle of Wight and is now doing a PhD in palaeontology. The two independently donated their finds to the local Dinosaur Isle museum.\n\u201cWe realised after the two snouts were found that this would be something rare and unusual,\u201d said Lockwood. \u201cThen it just got more and more amazing as several collectors found and donated other parts of this enormous jigsaw to the museum.\u201d\nThe only spinosaurid skeleton previously unearthed in the UK belonged to Baryonyx, which was initially discovered in 1983 in a quarry in Surrey. Most other finds since have been restricted to isolated teeth and single bones.\nThe new fossils will go on display at Dinosaur Isle at Sandown.",

However, local laws in cities such as New York and San Francisco prohibit the unvaccinated from certain public places, including indoor sports areas. That means unvaccinated players for teams such as the Brooklyn Nets and Golden State Warriors would not be able to participate in home games.\nAround 90% of NBA players are vaccinated, a much higher rate than the overall US population. However, there are questions over certain high-profile players.

The visitors were shambolic in the first half, essentially operating without a midfield and regularly wasting possession, allowing their opponents to storm into a 3-0 lead inside 34 minutes and largely coast to victory after the interval.\nNuno took personal responsibility but, speaking three days later, he put the emphasis on those who were on the pitch to get Tottenham back on track, starting on Thursday with the Europa Conference League group game against the Slovenian side NS Mura.\n\u201cThe mood is not good,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe are sad. Disappointed. This is a feeling that goes home with us, that doesn\u2019t allow us to sleep. But it can also make us stronger to react, and the reaction is tomorrow [against Mura]. We have to win, we have to play better, we have to compete better. That is my focus.\u201d\nSome Spurs fans, on social media and elsewhere, have made clear their lack of faith in Nuno and on Monday Jamie Carragher, in his capacity as a pundit for Sky Sports, said the former Wolves manager appeared a poor fit given the defensive nature of his tactical approach. In typically bullish fashion, Nuno dismissed such claims.\n\u201cEverybody wants to play offensive football, to score,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not possible but this is what we want to do. It takes a building process to achieve that and we are trying.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about judgments. What I\u2019m worried about is how can we improve. We still have a problem when we concede a goal \u2013 we lose our focus, and that\u2019s something we must avoid. A lot of analysis is going on and I have belief we have a talented squad who can play better football.\u201d\nNuno, who will be without Steven Bergwijn as the winger continues to recover from the ankle injury sustained in Spurs\u2019s opening group game against Rennes, also sought to clarify comments he made regarding guidance on heading restrictions in training brought in by the Football Association and the English game\u2019s other major bodies amid investigations into conditions such as dementia. Nuno admitted he did not count how many times his players headed the ball at training because heading is \u201cpart of the game.\u201d\n\u201cI just tried to tell the reality,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult in training to prevent heading. If you\u2019re playing a small-sided game and the ball goes in the air does it make sense to say: \u2018Don\u2019t head it\u2019? It\u2019s absurd.\n\u201cBut we are trying is to prevent this action repeating over and over again because we\u2019re aware it can cause dementia and we don\u2019t want to provoke any harm to our players.\u201d",

Promoting him over the more senior service chiefs would be a major upset however.\nThe interviews complete a two-stage process, which began with a series of grillings at the beginning of the month by an MoD panel headed by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary. Following that, Wallace sent his own recommendation to the prime minister, but the decision is ultimately Johnson\u2019s.\nA defence source said Johnson had been told by Stephen Lovegrove, the national security adviser, to seek somebody with \u201ccalm judgment\u201d.\nAmong the other candidates is Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, 57, the head of the army, who was at school with Johnson at Eton, which some believe could yet give him a chance. \u201cBoris does like to reward people who he thinks have loyalty to him,\u201d a former Downing Street staffer said.\nCompleting the field is head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, who presides over the service seen as having the best record on diversity. But he is not seen to be as strong a public speaker as Radakin, and insiders say he does not fancy his own chances strongly.\nDowning Street and the MoD declined to comment.\nTony Radakin: Royal Navy chief seen as a good public speaker with an eye for a PR opportunity, only last week announcing the appointment of Bond actor Daniel Craig as an honorary commander, to act as an advocate for service families.\nPatrick Sanders: Special forces veteran who served on every major deployment over the past 25 years. Recently admitted his experiences in Iraq had left him with suicidal thoughts, as he called for soldiers and veterans to seek help for PTSD.\nMark Carleton-Smith: Old Etonian and former SAS commander who took over as head of the army in 2018. Once in charge of the SAS\u2019s hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan \u2013 although the al-Qaida leader was ultimately shot by the US.\nMike Wigston: Comprehensive educated Welsh former Tornado pilot. Last month said the RAF was prepared to launch fresh, long-range strikes in Afghanistan even though there could be instances of \u201cunavoidable civilian casualties.\u201d\nBen Key: Head of operations whose profile soared during the Afghanistan crisis.

The biggest emitting state, Queensland, has a 30% target.\nIf all were to meet their goals and other states and territories kept emissions at 2019 levels, Australia would comfortably surpass the Morrison government\u2019s target of a 26-28% cut, reaching at least 34%. The national cut would be deeper if Western Australia and the Northern Territory set targets to reverse significant rises in their emissions over the past 15 years \u2013 up 21% and 47% respectively before Covid-19 hit \u2013 due to expanding fossil fuel developments.\nAnalysts contrasted the commitment by the NSW Coalition with its federal counterpart, which remains divided over whether to adopt a net zero emissions target for 2050 or increase its 2030 goal before the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in a month.\nBill Hare, chief executive and senior scientist with Climate Analytics, said it would \u201cclearly put a lot of pressure on the Morrison government\u201d, which has not introduced policies to significantly reduce emissions from electricity, industry or transport.\n\u201cIt shows the majority of Australians support doing more than the federal government,\u201d Hare said.\nHe said all states needed to do more to play their part in the world limiting global heating to 1.5C, but it was \u201ca good start\u201d.\n\u201cIt does put getting to net zero by 2050 within striking distance, whereas the national target is nowhere near it,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nMorrison signalled to a group of metropolitan Liberals during a private briefing on Tuesday that he wanted to reach an agreement with the National party before the Glasgow summit that included both a policy roadmap setting out a technological approach to emissions reduction, and a mid-century target.\nBut some in the National party remain opposed. The Queensland National Llew O\u2019Brien told Guardian Australia: \u201cUntil I see a plan that guarantees no increased cost of living pressures for regional Australians and businesses, energy reliability for domestic and commercial energy users and does not negatively affect resources industry jobs \u2013 both direct and indirect \u2013 I\u2019m not in support of signing onto a net carbon neutral by 2050 agreement.\u201d\nKen O\u2019Dowd, who holds the Queensland seat of Flynn, said net zero was not a big issue in his electorate. He said it was \u201creally a question for industry, not politicians\u201d because private operators would ultimately make the transition. \u201cIt is really industry we need to consult with to see what we should be doing,\u201d O\u2019Dowd said. \u201cWe have got a big discussion on our hands, and we have to consider things like nuclear energy as part of that discussion.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe more ambitious NSW commitment was based on updated emissions projections that suggested it was already on track to achieve a 47-52% emissions cut by 2030. It coincided with a report by the Beyond Zero Emissions thinktank that suggested green export industries could be worth triple the value of today\u2019s fossil fuels by 2050 if the country acted swiftly.\nMatt Kean, the NSW energy and environment minister, told rightwing broadcaster Sky News that Matt Canavan and others who cited the price of coal on global markets as a reason for Australia not to cut emissions were \u201cnot living in the real world\u201d, citing the case of Kodak, which crashed after failing to capitalise on the hunger for digital photography.\nHare said the state government had recognised that acting on the climate crisis was now about grasping the opportunity to create industries that would thrive in a low-emissions world, and not be left behind. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very strong message that\u2019s really resonating,\u201d he said.\nHe said it would also put pressure on other states. \u201cAny suggestion in Western Australia of a 2030 target that has emissions above its 2005 levels would be rightly viewed as completely unfair,\u201d he said.\nRebecca Mikula-Wright, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said the eastern state pledges aligned with changes under way on global capital markets, putting those jurisdictions in line with \u201cour major trading partners in the G20, including the US, Japan, Canada and the European Union\u201d.\n\u201cThe emerging gap between Australia\u2019s current national 2030 emissions targets and mainstream global investor practice, and company commitments to action, is a concern to institutional investors,\u201d she said.\nThe former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull criticised Morrison on Wednesday for saying he was yet to make up his mind on whether he would attend the Glasgow conference. Turnbull said he intended to go to the conference to pursue his interest in green hydrogen and the prime minister\u2019s absence would \u201csend a strong message about his priorities\u201d. \u201cHistory is made by those who turn up,\u201d he said.\nIndustry group the Clean Energy Council called on the government to include a target for Australia to be running entirely on renewable energy and storage by 2030 as part of any roadmap to be released before the Glasgow meeting. Its chief executive, Kane Thornton, said that alone would cut national emissions by 44% by 2030.\n\u201cDecarbonising the electricity sector is the most efficient pathway to net zero by 2050, so the sooner we get it done, the sooner we can focus on the areas of the economy that can take advantage of our low-cost zero-emissions electricity,\u201d he said.",

USOs are obligations intended to ensure that people have reasonable access to services both at home and at work. Leeser\u2019s proposal would only allow telcos to claim they provided mobile coverage in the relevant area if the device could be used in most of the home or business.\nAs well as the USO for mobiles, the bill includes a new customer service guarantee ensuring no caller to a telecommunications company would be left on hold for more than five minutes.\nThis guarantee would stipulate that anyone who was left without service at their home or business for more than six hours between 8am and 8pm over a month would get a month of free service from their provider.\nThe bill would also make bonuses paid to telco executives contingent on demonstrable improvements to customer service. It would hold companies and management financially liable for any preventable deaths caused by their inaction in disaster-prone areas.\nWhen a coroner finds that a death would have been prevented had the telco acted differently, significant financial penalties would be applied to the company and its executives.\nLeeser says his proposal follows years of inaction by Australia\u2019s telcos.\n\u201cTelecommunications is an essential service people rely on but for many people, the telco service is worse today than it was 20 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got kids studying for the HSC who can\u2019t connect with teachers because their internet doesn\u2019t work, teachers are presenting online classes from the McDonald\u2019s car park because they can\u2019t get reception at home.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people in life-threatening situations who can\u2019t dial triple zero because they have no mobile reception.

Supporters include Pat Conaghan, Tony Pasin, Rick Wilson, Llew O\u2019Brien, Jason Wood, Julian Simmonds, Anne Webster, Terry Young, Mark Coulton, Andrew Laming, Bert van Manen, Bridget Archer, Garth Hamilton, John Alexander, Damian Drum and Sarah Henderson.\nAsked whether he had developed the private member\u2019s bill and lobbied for party room support because of government inaction, Leeser said the minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, understood the issues.\n\u201cI thought this was a good way to indicate here is a new policy idea,\u201d Leeser said. \u201cOne of the roles of backbenchers is to come up with new policy ideas to address issues we are facing in our electorates \u2013 and this is what this is.\u201d\nIf passed by the parliament, the bill will force telcos to be more transparent with their customers about their performance, including publishing details of customer complaints in their annual reports. It would require companies to disclose to new customers where they are ranked in a customer service league table compiled by the industry ombudsman.\nLeeser also proposes to strengthen the ombudsman, allowing it to make directions and binding findings to resolve consumer complaints. The ombudsman would publish the customer service rankings on its website.\nWebster, a National MP representing the electorate of Mallee, said a USO for mobiles would go a long way to improving connectivity in the regions. She said services in the bush lagged metropolitan areas.\n\u201cRegional and rural areas, including in my electorate of Mallee, experience worse connectivity, leading to poorer outcomes for our communities,\u201d she said.\nArcher, a Liberal representing the marginal Tasmanian seat of Bass, said Leeser\u2019s proposal was necessary. \u201cLiving in a rural area myself, I understand the frustrations faced by constituents in the northern Tasmanian region, particularly those in very remote areas who have to rely on patchy, if any mobile coverage at best and immensely expensive satellite internet packages,\u201d she said.\nShe said farmers and people attempting to run a small business faced accessibility challenges \u201cthat can often leave them feeling as second-class citizens compared to their regional or city counterparts\u201d.\n\u201cThere is also the issue of safety for those who work in the agricultural industry and I speak to many constituents who remain concerned that if there were an accident on a farm or a natural disaster, they are left without vital phone services to call for help,\u201d Archer said.",

Maguire is out for a few weeks with a calf injury and the Manchester United captain\u2019s regular partner in central defence, John Stones, is yet to play for Manchester City this season.\nSouthgate also has issues over his full-backs. Trent Alexander-Arnold is out, Reece James is a major doubt with a twisted ankle and Ben Chilwell\u2019s hopes of a recall are complicated by the left-back\u2019s lack of action since helping Chelsea beat City in the Champions League final. Chilwell has previously provided competition for Luke Shaw, who hopes to be involved despite limping off in United\u2019s defeat by Aston Villa last weekend.\nThe defensive uncertainty is a headache for England, who are four points above Albania at the top of Group I before visiting Andorra and hosting Hungary three days later. However Southgate does have options at the back. Tyrone Mings impressed as Maguire\u2019s understudy against Croatia and Scotland at Euro 2020, Conor Coady is a trusted squad and Southgate is likely to bring back White.\nWhite, who has made a promising start at Arsenal since his \u00a350m move from Brighton, was part of the Euros squad and the 23-year-old missed last month\u2019s camp only because of a positive Covid-19 test. He could be joined by Fikayo Tomori; the former Chelsea defender has been outstanding for Milan this season.\nFurther forward Southgate is short of strikers to compete with Harry Kane. Leeds United\u2019s Patrick Bamford and Everton\u2019s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are injured and Marcus Rashford is recovering from shoulder surgery.\nTammy Abraham could return after excelling since leaving Chelsea for Roma, and Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings are also in contention. United\u2019s Mason Greenwood could miss out again as Southgate continues to manage the 19-year-old\u2019s workload. The Leicester winger Harvey Barnes is unlikely to make the cut.\nMeanwhile Callum Hudson-Odoi is unlikely to play for the Under-21s next month. The Chelsea winger decided not to attend last month\u2019s camp despite being called up by Lee Carsley and it is understood the situation has not changed.",

        "content": "In the middle of her long association with the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester, one critic opined that \u201cany production with Avril Elgar contains a nugget of gold\u201d. Her pedigree as an actor was apparent on television, too, notably as Yootha Joyce\u2019s social-climbing sister, Ethel, in the popular sitcom George and Mildred (1976-79).\nShort and wiry of stature, with dark, liquid eyes and definite features, Elgar, who has died aged 89, was a distinctive character actor of great resource and comic versatility.\nOn film, she was a raucous office cleaner \u2013 alongside Peggy Mount, Miriam Karlin and Dandy Nichols \u2013 in Ladies Who Do (1963), and a nosy neighbour in Spring and Port Wine (1970) with James Mason and Diana Coupland. On stage, she could \u201cduke\u201d it as Lady Bracknell at the Royal Exchange in 1993 or the Duchess of York in Michael Grandage\u2019s superb revival of Richard III starring Kenneth Branagh at the Sheffield Crucible in 2002.\nNot only was she endemic to the evolution of the Royal Exchange from its roots in the late 1950s under the directorship of Casper Wrede and Michael Elliott, she was also a key participant in the early days of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court, appearing in plays of John Osborne, Ann Jellicoe and Joe Orton.\nHer father, John Williams, went to bed drunk one night and woke up the next day in the army. Her mother, Annie (nee Rose), was a loyal army wife, and Avril, the couple\u2019s second daughter, was born in barracks in Halifax, West Yorkshire, moving on to Catterick, North Yorkshire, and Woolwich Arsenal, south London, before John was posted as an officer in the hill stations of India in the last days of the Raj.\nThe family returned to Britain in 1945 and settled in the West Country, where John swapped the army for teaching, and Avril\u2019s peripatetic education settled down at Penzance county grammar school. She developed a passion for theatre and, aged 17, played Andromache \u2013 white robe, hair in a bun \u2013 in the school\u2019s all-girl production of Euripides\u2019 The Trojan Women (in Gilbert Murray\u2019s translation) at the Minack open-air theatre, Porthcurno, Cornwall, in 1949, the first production in that magical location after the war.\nShe then won a place at the short-lived but influential Old Vic theatre school in London, which, in 1951, contained the nucleus of a group that worked together for years before finding a permanent home at the Royal Exchange. The group included Richard Negri, who designed the Exchange, the movement director Litz Pisk, and the actors Dilys Hamlett, who married Wrede (one of the Exchange\u2019s founding directors), Avril, who married the actor, director and writer James Maxwell (later the artistic director) in 1952, Rosalind Knight who married Elliott (the guiding spirit and co-founder), and Phyllida Law, who married Eric Thompson.\nWhen this extraordinary group left the school, they formed a small company, run on a shoestring, in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Avril had made a professional debut, using her middle name \u201cElgar\u201d as a surname, in an Arts Council tour of Macbeth playing the second witch and Lady Macduff\u2019s son (\u201cHe has killed me, mother\u201d). She opened another strand in her career as a dowdy spinster daughter (\u201cmerry as a jerboa,\u201d said Kenneth Tynan, singling her out in a cast led by Robert Stephens, Yvonne Mitchell and Wendy Craig), in Osborne\u2019s Epitaph for George Dillon (1958) at the Royal Court and on Broadway.\nIn that same 1958 Court season, she played Dodo in Jellicoe\u2019s The Sport of My Mad Mother (also with Craig) and Mrs Echo in The Hole by NF Simpson. The Old Vic school/Chorlton mob then dropped anchor briefly at the Lyric, Hammersmith, as the 59 theatre company, and Avril played Lucille Desmoulins in Georg Buechner\u2019s Danton\u2019s Death, directed by Wrede, with Maxwell as her doomed husband Camille. This production \u2013 with added star power from Patrick Wymark and Patrick McGoohan \u2013 was filmed by Elliott as part of the BBC\u2019s then lively \u201cworld theatre\u201d strand.\nBack at the Royal Court in 1961, Avril featured in an Edward Albee double-bill, The Death of Bessie Smith and The American Dream, and, in 1962, a now forgotten but ironically splenetic Osborne double-bill, The Blood of the Bambergs, a send-up of a royal wedding in the wake of Princess Margaret\u2019s to Lord (Tony) Snowdon; and Under Plain Cover, in which Jonathan Miller made his directorial debut in a sharp satire of moral hypocrisy through the exposure of incest and sadomasochism in the suburbs; Avril was a proud and grateful mother at this \u201calternative\u201d wedding paid for by the press long before Hello! magazine existed.\nThe director William Gaskill had been her champion at the Royal Court and, when he succeeded George Devine as artistic director in 1965, she was back in Sloane Square in two not-so-successful plays by Jellicoe and Simpson, and as Lady Kix in Gaskill\u2019s revival of Thomas Middleton\u2019s tumultuous Jacobean comedy A Chaste Maid in Cheapside; she played Kix as a vivid schemer who cuckolds her impotent husband by bedding another and getting pregnant in order to cheat the nominated legatee of his inheritance. And in 1967 she was one of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters alongside Glenda Jackson and Marianne Faithfull in Gaskill\u2019s austere, beautiful production of Edward Bond\u2019s adaptation.\nHer last Royal Court appearance was in Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s A Pagan Place (1972), with Dave Allen and Brenda Fricker. By then, 59 theatre company was the 69, at the Manchester University theatre, and she rejoined them for Peer Gynt and as Agatha in TS Eliot\u2019s The Family Reunion, one of Elliott\u2019s many outstanding productions.\nThe Royal Exchange opened triumphantly in 1976 \u2013 the most exciting theatre space in Britain. Avril and her husband remained heavily involved for its first 20 years. She was a remarkable Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, mouldy as her own wedding cake, evincing a spooky authority; a hectic Mrs Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, swinging her arms around like a rag doll\u2019s; and a dragonish Lady Bracknell with Sam West as Algernon and Marcia Warren a perfect Miss Prism.\nHer major early television work, apart from George and Mildred, came in two series in 1974: Carrie\u2019s War, playing the timid sister of a harsh rural shopkeeper; and The Stars Look Down, Alan Plater\u2019s adaptation of AJ Cronin\u2019s saga set in a Geordie mining village. And she reprised an extract of Lady Bracknell in Brian Gilbert\u2019s Wilde (1997), scripted by Julian Mitchell, with Stephen Fry as Oscar and Jude Law as Bosie.\nAvril appeared sporadically at the National Theatre, notably in Mitchell\u2019s Half Life (1977), boasting one of John Gielgud\u2019s distinctive valedictory performances as a crusty archaeologist in his country home near Stonehenge; and in Eduardo de Filippo\u2019s Inner Voices (1983, adapted by Simpson), with Ralph Richardson\u2019s last stage appearance at its mystical, mesmerising centre.\nShe was also in Pam Gems\u2019s Stanley (1996) with Antony Sher as the oddball painter Stanley Spencer, and an intriguing 1888 Swedish play, The Enchantment (2007); Victoria Benedictsson, its author, took her own life after a love affair with a critic, Georg Brandes.\nHer last stage appearance was as the ageing, bejewelled mother-in-law, walled off in a membrane of deafness and indifference, in Andrew Hilton\u2019s Tobacco Factory revival of Uncle Vanya for the newly refurbished Bristol Old Vic in 2009.\nShe moved in 2012 from Temple Fortune, north London, to a retirement village in Bristol. Her husband died in 1995. She is survived by her two sons, Adam and Dan, and by three grandchildren, Sophie, Rhoda and Virginia.\n Avril Elgar (Williams), actor, born 1 April 1932; died 17 September 2021",

        "content": "Analysis: Beijing\u2019s increasingly hardline approach sends a chilling message \nThe release of two Canadian hostages by China has ended a lengthy feud between the two countries, but experts caution the saga foreshadows a deepening rift between the two nations.\nAfter facing charges of espionage and spending more than 1,000 days in detention, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were set free by Chinese authorities late last week. Accompanied by Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, the pair arrived home early on Saturday morning.\nThe two had been detained after Canada\u2019s arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who also arrived home after she and the US justice department reached a deferred prosecution agreement.\nThe surprise releases ended an impasse that tested the diplomatic resolve of Canada, which found itself caught in the middle of a broader feud between Beijing and Washington.\nBut experts caution that China\u2019s increasingly hardline approach \u2013 and the brazenness with which it was willing to engage in \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d \u2013 should be taken as a warning to other nations.\n\u201cChina was sending a message not just to Canada, but to every other country in the world that they take hostages. And if you step out of line from their policies or don\u2019t toe the line the way Beijing has instructed you to do, then they will take retaliatory action and kidnap your citizens,\u201d said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Ottawa\u2019s graduate school of public and international affairs. \u201cThis is the behaviour of a medieval kingdom \u2013 not a 2021 superpower.\u201d\nBeijing has maintained the arrest of the Canadians was unconnected to Meng, but it has suggested their fates were linked. Beijing gave no legal explanation for the Canadians\u2019 release or the timing of it, only later saying the two men had applied for and been granted bail on unspecified \u201cmedical grounds\u201d.\nThe detention of Meng was \u201ca political frame-up and persecution against a Chinese citizen, an act designed to hobble Chinese hi-tech companies\u201d, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Monday. \u201cCanada should draw lessons and act in ways that serve its own interests.\u201d\nIn China the focus has been squarely on Meng. State media coverage of the hero\u2019s welcome barely \u2013 if at all \u2013 mentioned the Canadians\u2019 cases, and discussions on social media were quickly censored. As she arrived on a chartered jet to a red carpet and welcome home messages on Shenzhen\u2019s tallest skyscraper, the executive\u2019s return was credited to the \u201cunremitting efforts\u201d of the Chinese Communist party government.\nBefore Canada found itself the target of China\u2019s outrage, the two countries had been on the verge of negotiating a free trade agreement. Canadian companies, spurned by protectionist measures in the US under Donald Trump, had been eager to find new markets for their heavy oil, metallurgical coal, timber and agricultural products.\nBut Ottawa\u2019s refusal to cave to demands for Meng\u2019s release makes it difficult for the two countries to move forward in normalising relations, said McCuaig-Johnson.\n\u201cCanada wasn\u2019t seen as giving China what it wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, Canada is still likely to be frozen out of a lot of activities in China.\u201d\nThe headaches Canadian companies might face in the coming months come against the backdrop of President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent moves to reshape China\u2019s economy and his government\u2019s aggressive approach to foreign technology companies.\nIn addition to the challenges of a middle-power country squaring off against an economic powerhouse, Canada\u2019s exclusion from the Aukus pact complicates its ability to exercise influence in the region. McCuaig-Johnson believes the federal government is likely to ban Huawei\u2019s 5G infrastructure in the coming months, which could improve its standing among allies \u2013 but will probably further frustrate China.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of the frosty relationship,\u201d she said.\nEven without the broader geopolitical backdrop, there is little popular support in Canada for re-engaging with Beijing.\nCanadian views of China have dimmed in recent years and major political parties have made being tough on China part of their platforms, said Lynette Ong, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\n\u201cEven if the government wanted relations to go back to the way they were before, they would be reprimanded by the opposition as well as by the electorate,\u201d she said.\nCanada\u2019s foreigner minister admitted as much over the weekend to CBC News, when he said Canada\u2019s \u201ceyes are wide open\u201d when it next steps with China, adding his government planned to \u201ccoexist\u201d, \u201ccompete\u201d, \u201ccooperate\u201d, and \u201cchallenge\u201d.\nThe speed with which China released the two captives is also unlikely to help normalise relations, said Ong, because it only underscores the reality that both men were being held hostage.\n\u201cGiven China\u2019s insistence the case of the two Michaels was not a hostage exchange \u2013 that they violated a Chinese law \u2013 it seems they would have done more to maintain that idea,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the timing of their release certainly does suggest China has lifted the veil of the facade.\u201d\nThe US also appeared keen to avoid the perception that it had made any prisoner exchange agreement. On Monday the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, rejected the suggestion, and said the Canadians\u2019 cases had been discussed \u2013 but not negotiated \u2013 in a phone call between Joe Biden and Xi weeks earlier.\nPsaki said the deferred prosecution agreement with Meng was an independent action by the department of justice. \u201cThis is a law enforcement matter,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThere is no link.\u201d\nWhile relations between China and Canada are likely to remain chilled, China\u2019s actions have spurred other nations to take on more defensive positions.\n\u201cChina is now feeling the heat of western democracies forming alliances and trying to contain its rise,\u201d she said, pointing to the group of allies gathered outside the courts while the two Canadians were facing charges, as well as a joint declaration condemning arbitrary detention. \u201cThey got Ms Meng in the end \u2013 but that win might have come at a huge cost.\u201d",

        "content": "UK researchers studied 600,000 women over three decades\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is not linked to an increased risk of developing dementia, according to the largest study of its kind.\nThe treatment is used by millions of women worldwide to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, sleep disturbance, mood swings, memory losses and depression.\nIn the UK, about 14% of women aged between 50 and 59 use HRT, and about 5% of those aged 40 to 49 and 60 to 69, researchers said. Some menopausal symptoms are similar to early signs of dementia.\nPrevious research into HRT and dementia has been inconsistent.\nLaboratory studies and small trials have suggested a beneficial link between oestrogen and age-related brain decline. However, a randomised controlled trial found an increased risk of developing dementia among users of oestrogen-progestogen treatments. Two Finnish studies have also provided conflicting results.\nTo try to end years of uncertainty, researchers at the University of Oxford, Southampton and Nottingham set out to investigate the risks of developing dementia for women using any of the forms of HRT commonly prescribed within the NHS.\nTheir study, involving more than 600,000 women over three decades, concluded that HRT is not linked to an increased risk of dementia. The findings were published in the BMJ.\n\u201cThis large observational study found no overall association between use of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of developing dementia,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThis finding was consistent across different types of hormones, doses, applications, and time of hormone therapy initiation.\u201d\nThe researchers added that the study \u201cbrings clarity to previously inconsistent findings and should reassure women in need of menopausal hormonal therapy\u201d.\nThey used primary care databases to analyse HRT prescriptions for 118,501 women in the UK aged 55 and older diagnosed with dementia between 1998 and 2020, and 497,416 women matched by age and general practice, but with no records for dementia.\nOther relevant factors, such as family history, smoking, alcohol consumption and pre-existing conditions, were taken into account in the analysis.\nAfter adjusting for the full range of potentially confounding factors, the researchers found no overall associations between use of hormone therapy and risk of dementia, regardless of hormone type, application, dose, or duration of treatment.\nThere were different findings among some of the sub-groups within the study. In women younger than 80 who had been taking oestrogen-only therapy for 10 years or more, researchers found a 15% reduced risk of dementia.\nHowever, an analysis of cases with a specific diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease showed a slight increase in risk associated with oestrogen-progestogen therapy.\nWomen taking oestrogen-progestogen therapy for between five and nine years had an 11% increased risk and those taking it for over a decade were deemed to have a 19% heightened risk. Researchers described this as being equivalent to, respectively, five and seven extra cases per 10,000 woman years.\nThe study was observational, so cannot establish cause, and the researchers acknowledged some limitations, such as incomplete recording of menopausal symptoms, particularly for women registered after their menopause, that may have affected their results.\nHowever, the study used a large data sample from primary care records and is the first of its kind to assess overall risk for women exposed to different types of HRT.\n\u201cThe findings will be helpful to policymakers, doctors and patients when making choices about hormone therapy,\u201d they concluded.\nIn a linked opinion piece in the BMJ, Prof Pauline Maki, from the University of Illinois, and Prof JoAnn Manson, from Harvard Medical School, said the results should provide \u201creassurance\u201d for women.",

The collapse of a further three will force the regulator to move 233,000 more customer accounts, with bills expected to increase as a result.\nOfgem said Igloo Energy, Symbio Energy and Enstroga had become the latest companies to succumb to a gathering crisis that shows no sign of abating, with gas prices remaining stubbornly high amid international shortages as winter approaches.\nThe regulator emphasised that customers would not have any disruption to the supply of energy to their homes, adding that anyone with credit in their accounts with those companies would not lose their money.\nBut it will have to find a new provider for nearly a quarter of a million people through its \u201csupplier of last resort\u201d scheme, under which financially healthy companies take on customers from collapsed rivals.\nThose that were on cheaper fixed-rate tariffs, often used by smaller, start-up energy companies to woo new customers, will see their bills increase to the government\u2019s energy cap, which is \u00a31,277 for a household with average usage.\nA report by Citizens Advice, published today, has found that consumers who are moved to a new supplier typically pay \u00a330 a month more than before. Advisers at the charity fear many will face fuel poverty this winter and could end up turning off their fridges and freezers, relying on hot-water bottles for warmth and requesting support to buy extra duvets and blankets.\nClare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cOvernight price hikes will be a shock for more than a million households whose energy companies have gone bust. We\u2019re particularly worried about those who\u2019ll face desperate choices this winter because of the cumulative impact of soaring bills, the planned cut to universal credit and inflation.\n\u201cThe government and Ofgem must guarantee that the warm home discount will be continued for people moving to new energy suppliers. People on the lowest incomes should be able to access emergency winter grants so they can stay warm in the cold months ahead.\u201d\nEarlier this week, Shell Energy took on 255,000 customers from a collapsed smaller rival, Green, while Octopus Energy has taken on 580,000 customers stranded when Avro Energy failed.\nBefore the latest collapses, announced on Wednesday, the number of households supplied by an energy company that had gone bust this year totalled almost 2m, forcing Ofgem into an unprecedented scramble to keep to the customer transfer system going.\nNeil Lawrence, the director of retail at Ofgem, said: \u201cWe know this is a worrying time for many people and news of a supplier going out of business can be unsettling.\n\u201cI want to reassure customers of Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy that they do not need to worry. Under our safety net we\u2019ll make sure your energy supplies continue. If you have credit on your Enstroga, Igloo Energy or Symbio Energy account, the funds you have paid in are protected and you will not lose the money that is owed to you.\n\u201cOfgem will choose a new supplier for you, and while we are doing this our advice is to wait until we appoint a new supplier and do not switch in the meantime.\n\u201cYou can rely on your energy supply as normal. We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your tariff. Any customer worried about paying their energy bill should contact their supplier to access the range of support that is available.\u201d\nIgloo Energy is the largest of the companies that went under on Wednesday, with 179,000 customers, followed by Symbio with 48,000 and Enstroga with 6,000.\nIgloo blamed high gas prices and the government\u2019s energy price cap, which it said was a good idea but had been \u201cdesigned to favour the largest suppliers\u201d.",

        "content": "Could the benefits seen in Lincoln since the university\u2019s inception be replicated in similar areas?\nWhen the University of Lincoln  was first built on a derelict rail goods yard, it\u2019s said that one of its buildings was designed to be converted into a shopping centre if the university didn\u2019t work out.\nWhile that may be an apocryphal story, it speaks to the tremendous success of the university and its value to the local community. Since its inception in 1996, Lincoln has grown from 500 students to 14,500, generating \u00a3430m for the local economy annually. In this small east Midlands city of 99,000 people it is a vital presence: one in six people either works with the university or studies there.\nLocal residents say the university has transformed Lincoln from provincial backwater to a culturally thriving, diverse city, with new shops and restaurants springing up to accommodate students and the graduates who stay to work in hi-tech businesses supported by the university.\nMuch of this transformation is credited to the university\u2019s vice-chancellor, Mary Stuart, who retires in October after 12 years at the helm. During this period, she doubled student numbers by expanding its science and technology departments in key areas for the local economy.\n\u201cThe story of Lincoln is about regeneration,\u201d she said. \u201cI am passionate about supporting your place, understanding your place, working with local people to get under the skin of a place so you are not telling or dictating, but you\u2019re working with.\u201d\nDavid Willetts, the former universities minister who oversaw the switch to \u00a39,000 student loans for tuition fees in 2012, has today called on the government to build universities in more places like Lincoln, such as Blackpool, to help regenerate local economies, and boost higher education funding by making graduates repay loans more quickly.\nWriting in a paper for the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), Willetts argues demand for university degrees remains high, and says the government should keep expanding the higher education sector as a way of encouraging economic growth.\nHe says that rather than attempt to reduce the numbers of school-leavers going into higher education, the government should continue to encourage campuses across England.\n\u201cMany towns without one see gaining a higher education institution as one of the best ways of boosting their prospects. They attract young people to an area instead of losing them as they go to university elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBlackpool council is supposed to have turned down a new university decades ago, so it went to Lancaster instead: now is the time for Blackpool to rethink that decision. Other towns such as Wigan and Wakefield are candidates,\u201d Willetts writes.\nTo enable other universities to replicate Lincoln\u2019s success, Stuart would like to see greater support across government for universities\u2019 role in economic development.\n\u201cWe want to help the levelling up agenda, we\u2019re doing everything we can to support it. I\u2019ve always been very aware there\u2019s a disparity between regions \u2013 in particular, the east Midlands doesn\u2019t get a lot of funding. We\u2019ve been working really hard and using our resources wherever we can, and some recognition for universities \u2013 not just Lincoln \u2013 that do this work would be great,\u201d she said. \n She added this should be underpinned by a university funding model that is \u201cfair to students, fair to graduates, and fair to universities\u201d, reflecting the benefits universities bring even to those who do not attend.\nTo encourage graduates to stay on and give back to the region after their studies, Lincoln targets pupils in local schools. Many recruits are from deprived post-industrial rural and coastal areas, and schools say they would not have considered an option outside their region.\nThe university also collaborates with local employers to create highly skilled jobs. This has included a new science and innovation park, as well as partnerships with Siemens, which expanded its presence in Lincoln as a result, and Lincolnshire Co-operative. It also founded the Lincoln Institute for Agri-food Technology to support Lincolnshire\u2019s role in producing 12% of the UK\u2019s food supply.\nThe result is a city which appreciates the contribution its students make. Will Porter, a third year student at the university\u2019s new medical school, said he has felt \u201cvery welcomed and valued\u201d by local residents. \u201cThe people I\u2019ve spoken to see [the university] as a positive thing, it creates jobs, more buzz, and excitement and more things to do,\u201d he said.\nHis view is echoed by local business-owner Ben Poole. His shop, Imperial Teas, has grown thanks to increased custom, especially from students\u2019 parents, and he regularly employs students. He also works closely with the university\u2019s performing arts department to produce community theatre productions.\nPoole says: \u201cThe effect on the economy has been dramatic \u2013 the city has grown tremendously since the arrival of the university. I can\u2019t see a downside to the impact it\u2019s had. I\u2019m sure most businesses would say they\u2019ve benefited.\u201d",

After failing to produce the appropriate documentation, they were denied entry and turned around. It is believed they spent the night at a Kingscliff hotel.\nThe Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) has named the eight team members as players Sebasti\u00e1n Cancelliere, Joaqu\u00edn D\u00edaz Bonilla, Felipe Ezcurra, Pablo Matera, Santiago Medrano and Santiago Socino, along with manager Lucas Chioccarelli and video analyst Rodrigo Mart\u00ednez.\nQueensland Health reinstated the non-restricted border zone rules for Tweed Heads and Byron Bay from 1am on Wednesday, meaning residents of the shires and Queenslanders travelling to these areas will be able to cross the expanded border bubble for work, education, compassionate care and essential shopping again, provided they have received one dose of vaccination.\nHowever, the Pumas\u2019 recreational visit to a health retreat did not meet that threshold.\nIn a statement on Thursday morning, Sanzaar said all members of the group will have no further involvement in the tournament because of their \u201cdirect breach of the present Queensland Government health orders\u201d. They will remain in NSW until Sunday, when they will rejoin the squad to fly home.\nThe governing body said they had crossed the border \u201cwithout the permission of the tournament and without seeking clarity on their ability to re-enter Queensland under the existing Covid border restrictions\u201d.\n\u201cSanzaar is very disappointed that such a breach has occurred given the clear rules that are in place to ensure the health and safety of all players and staff, and compliance with all relevant health orders,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSanzaar would like to thank the Queensland government for their continued support and leadership in facilitating the Rugby Championship in the state over the last four consecutive weeks.\u201d\nSanzaar said the match at Cbus Super Stadium will proceed as planned given Argentina\u2019s plentiful playing squad of 44 players comfortably caters for the several absences, and the team will announce their matchday squad later on Thursday.\nThe UAR has started an internal process \u201cto clarify and to determine responsibility for what has happened\u201d.\n\u201cThey are all in perfect good health, lodged at a hotel in the area, waiting for their current condition to be solved,\u201d the UAR said. \u201cFor now, their only limitation is the temporary impossibility to go through the state jurisdiction and return to Queensland to meet the rest of the team members. For the UAR, bringing a solution to this issue has become a top priority.\u201d\nArgentina are bottom of the Rugby Championship table ahead of the final round and winless after losing 27-8 to the Wallabies in Townsville last Saturday night.",

country\u2019s borders to finally reopen.\n In evidence to the Senate\u2019s Covid committee on Thursday, the chief executive of Services Australia, Rebecca Skinner, said the department had developed a visible digital seal for vaccine status that would be ready by the end of October.\n\u201cOur plan is to have all of the technology in place so that it is a settled and tested situation before the policy decisions need to be made.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a situation where policy decisions can\u2019t be taken because the technology isn\u2019t ready.\u201d\nThe so-called visible digital seal (VDS) project will allow Australians to verify their vaccination status with home affairs, who will create a \u201chighly authenticated\u201d digital record for travel and for use by third parties, such as airlines and other countries.\nServices Australia said at the request of an individual through the Medicare app, the department would send a person\u2019s vaccination status to the Passport Office.\n\u201cWhat they will then do is take that data, make sure it\u2019s all correct, and then they will put what they call a visible digital seal on to a certificate that they will then send back to us,\u201d the department\u2019s Charles McHardie said.\n\u201cAnd that certificate will then appear straight away in your Medicare Express Plus app, and then you can download it to your phone.\u201d\n\u201cThat can be used at, you know departure gates, etcetera, wherever it may be utilised as the borders start to open up.\u201d\nThe VDS technology is internationally recognised and was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and uses cryptographic technology already in place for ePassport authentication used by more than 145 countries.\nUnder the four-stage reopening plan signed off by state and territory leaders, 70% adult vaccination rates will allow governments to \u201cease restrictions on vaccinated residents (TBD)\u201d and at 80% the federal government will \u201clift all restrictions on outbound travel\u201d for vaccinated Australians.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, has flagged he intends to reopen the country\u2019s borders once states reach the 80% double dose vaccination rate and once states are ready to implement home quarantining arrangements.\nMorrison said earlier this week that the closed borders, which had been in place since March 2020, would soon be lifted.\n\u201cWe will see our international borders, particularly for Australians to leave and return and Australians who are overseas and have been vaccinated to return, and that will occur before the end of the year,\u201d Morrison told CBS news on Sunday.\n\u201cIt could happen well before that,\u201d he said, pointing to the \u201cresilience\u201d that was being achieved through growing vaccination rates.\nAbout 40,000 Australians overseas have registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs as wanting to return home on government repatriation flights.\nThe South Australian and New South Wales governments have been trialling home quarantine arrangements, which will allow vaccinated travellers to quarantine at home, rather than pay for hotel quarantine.\nNSW and the ACT are on track to reach an 80% double-dose vaccination rate in the second half of October, while Victoria is set to meet the target by 5 November.\nMorrison has confirmed that some states could end up opening to international arrivals before others, particularly the Covid-free states that have hard borders with other states still in place.\nThe WA premier, Mark McGowan, has indicated the state may keep its border closed until well into 2022, while Tasmania has said it wants a 90% vaccination rate before it opens up.\nServices Australia was also questioned over the development of digital vaccination proof that would be provided to states for use in check-in apps.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLabor senator Kimberley Kitching criticised the planned approach, which would see eight different systems in place across the country, with each state having its own check-in system.\nBut McHardie said this approach had been taken as each state would have different public health orders and requirements, and integrating the proof of vaccination into existing systems would be the most streamlined approach.\n\u201cOur approach has been, particularly for high volume venues, to reduce friction on both staff in those venues and also friction for customers, to leverage the current check-in apps that all of the jurisdictions currently have,\u201d McHardie said.\n\u201cOur view was, let\u2019s integrate the capability that we have here in Services Australia in being able to prove that a citizen has been vaccinated and integrate that into the state-based check-in apps.\u201d",

The message read: \u201cNo more payments until when schools open.\u201d\n\u201cMy husband and I decided to leave our rented house in town and shifted to the village, to our unfinished house. We could not afford to continue paying rent,\u201d says Namitala, from her home in Bombo in central Uganda, about 20 miles north of the capital Kampala.\nShe had no choice but to find other sources of income.\n\u201cI have transitioned from teaching into farming and there\u2019s a ready market for our produce,\u201d she says, pointing to rows of tomato plants in her garden, and the chickens she is breeding. She has even rented an extra plot of land to grow more crops.\n\u201cI will not leave my business, which I started, to devote all my time to teach again,\u201d she says, adding that other former colleagues have done the same.\nAbout 40% of Uganda\u2019s primary schools and 60% of its secondaries are private institutions, run by individuals, religious organisations, charities and businesses, with no help from the local authorities. Their main source of income is through school fees, which cover all running costs, including teachers\u2019 salaries, which range from $100 to $250 (350,000 to 880,000 Ugandan shillings) a month.\nSome private schools offer a high-quality education and good facilities, some are started as business ventures, purely to make money for the owners. But many others are opened and funded by families or villages in areas where government schools are overcrowded or too far away.\nWhen schools closed, parents stopped paying, income dried up and most schools had to reduce or stop paying teachers\u2019 salaries.\nThe government continued to pay the wages of state school teachers, but its promises to assist private school teachers have gone unfulfilled.\nThe Economic Policy Research Centre, a thinktank in Kampala, reported in May that 85% of private schools were not paying full teacher salaries due to financial challenges brought on by Covid-19.\nAcross sub-Saharan Africa, 50% of private school teachers (15% of the total number of teachers) saw a drop of 50% in salaries on average.\nLike Namitala, many teachers in Uganda have found new careers, which threaten the future of private schools. Hundreds are being put up for sale due to pressures from banks to repay loans and disinterest from owners to reopen.\nRobert Kimenya, headteacher at Green Galaxy nursery and primary school, near Kampala, says many of his teachers left because of Covid closures. \u201cI have two teachers who have joined the army. Some have relocated to their villages. That means when we open, some schools will not get teachers, including government schools.\u201d\nGeorge Wakirwaine, 30, a teacher for seven years at a community school in Kampala, could not afford to keep his wife and two daughters in the city when his wages dried up. He sent them to his family\u2019s village. His survival has largely depended on the goodwill of the parents whose children he taught. He also fetches water for homes in the neighbourhood for a small fee.\n\u201cI am looking for other ways to survive. It makes me sad that I have to leave this profession,\u201d he says.\nSome teachers have no plans to return to the profession.\n\u201cI will never go back [to teaching],\u201d says one former teacher, who now runs a tailoring shop in Kampala. Another, who is also running a shop, says: \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it. First, there is no money, and when you find yourself in such a situation [long closures], no help whatsoever.\u201d\nNicholas Bwire, who leads the Mukono Private Teachers Association, a loose association of up to 500 private school teachers in Mukono district near Kampala, says: \u201cIt reached a point where teachers started begging parents to give them something to eat. They now call us beggars who go to them to beg what to eat.\u201d\nRacheal Namugaya, 30, a teacher at Global junior school in central Uganda, says she will not leave teaching, but she will keep her fresh food market stall running when schools reopen, as a cushion against future closures. She is among the lucky ones. Although her salary stopped, the school still provides her accommodation and occasionally food.\nBut it is the market stall that has supported her. \u201cI get what to eat, feed my child and provide medication, in case she is sick,\u201d the mother of one says. \u201cI got a loan from friends to start off. They trusted me. I have paid off the loan. The business is doing well.\n\u201cI will not close [my business] when schools open. I will get someone to help, but keep very much involved.\u201d\nFor now, there is little chance of schools reopening, despite appeals from teachers\u2019 unions and Unicef. The government is insisting teachers are vaccinated before returning to work. More than 80% of teachers have yet to receive their first dose. The government confirmed last week that schools will remain closed until January, continuing the disruption to education for 15 million children across the country. Universities are expected to reopen in November.\nEducation minister and first lady Janet Museveni called for patience, saying while \u201cteachers in private schools have suffered \u2026 [the] government has chosen to let schools remain closed \u2026 to ensure that the lives of children remain safe from the danger that the Covid-19 pandemic brings\u201d.\nNamitala says Covid had taught teachers a big lesson. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to create other ways of survival.\u201d",

He added: \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t add up and we don\u2019t know what.\u201d\nLe Drian reiterated that French contractor Naval Group had received a letter on the same day the contract was broken saying Australia was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the strategic review of the submarines and was ready for the \u201crapid signature for the second phase of the programme\u201d.\nAs a result, the decision to break the multibillion submarine contract was met with \u201cstupor\u201d in France, he said.\nThe letter in question has not been publicly released. The Guardian has contacted the Australian government for comment, but it has previously played down the letter\u2019s significance.\nLast week a spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Defence told the Guardian: \u201cOn 15 September 2021, Naval Group was advised that the formal exit of a system review had been achieved as required under the contractual arrangements in place at the time.\u201d\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cThis correspondence did not refer to or authorise commencement of the next phase of the program, which remained subject to the announcement of decisions by the Australian government.\u201d\nThe Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has repeatedly defended the fallout from his joining with the UK and the US for a new defence cooperation arrangement to deliver nuclear-propelled submarines.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nMorrison maintains he acted in Australia\u2019s national security interests at a time of a worsening strategic outlook in the Indo-Pacific, while acknowledging France\u2019s \u201cdisappointment\u201d.\nBut Le Drian said right up to the day of what he described as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d, France was being reassured by Australia that everything was fine.\nHe repeated that what was at stake was far more than a commercial contract, and involved the broader strategic relationship between the two countries.\nLe Drian said Australia had \u201casked for conventional submarines\u201d as opposed to nuclear-powered vessels. That is a reference to specifications set by the Australia government when it launched a competitive evaluation process for the future submarine project in 2015.\n\u201cThese are the facts and they speak for themselves,\u201d Le Drian told a Foreign Affairs, Defence and Armed Forces Committee of the upper house, the S\u00e9nat. He added that the Australian decision to throw over a partnership with France for a pact with the US meant it had given up its defence sovereignty.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nLe Drian repeated several times that the Aukus deal represented a \u201ctotal loss of sovereignty\u201d for Australia.\n\u201cIt is not just the breaking of a contract, it is a betrayal and a breaking of trust,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe effect is that Australia has abandoned its sovereignty and made a leap into the unknown with the choice of technology it doesn\u2019t control and won\u2019t control in the future. This puts it at the mercy of US politics.\u201d\nLe Drian said France still did not know what role the UK would play in the project.\n\u201cThe ball is in the British camp. If they want to go forward confidence needs to be rebuilt.\u201d\nLe Drian said France was \u201cwaiting for strong actions and not just words\u201d. He said the French ambassador would return to Australia \u201cwhen we have had a review\u201d. The ambassador to France is returning to the US this week. Both were recalled for consultations in France \u201cto show the gravity of this treason and breach of trust\u201d.\nHe said the US\u2019s strategy in the Indo-Pacific was based on \u201cconfrontation, even military confrontation\u201d, and said France wanted to work with \u201cother actors in the Indo-Pacific\u201d to combat Chinese expansion in the region.\nThe minister said France had the support of the EU27. \u201cThey perfectly understood this crisis and this was not just friendly support with France \u2026 they realise that what is at stake. This is a strategic European crisis.\u201d\nEarlier, an \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said any future talks between Emmanuel Macron and Morrison over the fallout from Canberra\u2019s decision to tear up the submarine deal would have to be \u201cseriously prepared\u201d and have \u201csubstance\u201d.\nThe Australian trade minister, Dan Tehan, has also struggled to secure a meeting with his French counterpart during a forthcoming trip to Paris, where he will also attend OECD and World Trade Organization-related meetings.

This film is a hollow Blade Runner copycat, set in a grungy, neon-lit futuristic world where artificial intelligence convincingly passes for human, yet people drink coffee out of polystyrene cups and use landline telephones. The script feels completely devoid of ideas about what the future of AI might look like. But what it does prove is that Pearce adds a basic layer of credibility to any film simply by showing up.\nHe plays former cop David Carmichael, a private investigator. You\u2019ll know the type: ex-drinker; seen action in the army; a man of few words; harbours a dark secret. He\u2019s been summoned by tech billionaire with a monstrous ego Marlon Veidt (played by Vikings actor Travis Fimmel underneath ridiculous ageing makeup and a scraggly white wig). Like all the villains in the movie, Fimmel goes full ham with a show of deviancy and creepy tics, more silly than scary. As Veidt, he is the creator of lifelike robots which the government permits to be trialled in Zone 414, the only district where humans and AI can interact.\nThe zone functions as an exclusive brothel for rich men, where the AIs are slaves and sex toys. The trouble is that Veidt\u2019s own daughter has slipped into this dystopian swamp and disappeared. It\u2019s Carmichael\u2019s job to find her, assisted by gorgeous AI Jane (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz), who of course has more soul in her computerised little finger than the entire district of seedy humans. What a waste of Pearce this movie is, requiring him to chase after baddies in underground car parks and run the gamut of facial expressions from glower to grimace.\n Zone 414 is released on 4 October on digital platforms.",

        "content": "Met officer used police ID card and handcuffs to lure Everard into car before killing her and burning body\nThe former Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens is to be sentenced for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, amid calls for a formal law to set out the rights of victims.\nCouzens, 48, used his police warrant card and handcuffs to lure Everard off the street before strangling her with his police belt and burning her body, a court heard.\nVideo footage released on Wednesday showed Couzens, then a serving Metropolitan police officer, staging a false arrest of Everard as she returned from a friend\u2019s house in south London in March during a period of coronavirus lockdown measures.\nLord Justice Fulford will decide on the minimum length of Couzens\u2019 life sentence on Thursday at the Old Bailey in central London.\nSpeaking on Thursday morning, the Labour leader reiterated his calls for a victims\u2019 law, granting rights such as allowing them to challenge decisions over criminal investigations. Keir Starmer also called for a review of how Couzens was allowed to remain in the police force despite concerns about his conduct.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of how that happened,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt looks as though there were some telltale signs; there was evidence, there were issues that should have been looked into properly, and they were not. And it is now vital that that review is done.\n\u201cBut then there needs to be wider reform. I\u2019ve been arguing for a victims\u2019 law for years, since I was director of public prosecutions. One of the things I said in my speech yesterday: we have codes, we have support, but we have nothing in law that is there to support victims. I feel very, very strongly about it. And we need legislation on violence against women and girls.\u201d\nThe full details of Couzens\u2019 crimes were detailed for the first time at a hearing on Wednesday to decide whether he should be sentenced to die in jail. The prosecution said the crimes were so serious, involving the abuse of his position and trust as a police officer, they might merit him being sentenced to a whole-life tariff.\nThe offence of murder, which Couzens has admitted, carries a mandatory life sentence.\nHe handcuffed her in the backseat of his car and \u201cthat was the start of her lengthy ordeal, including an 80-mile journey [to Kent] while detained, which was to lead first to her rape and then her murder\u201d, Tom Little QC told the Old Bailey.\n\u201cAt some point fairly soon after driving from the pavement on to the South Circular and having not gone to a police station, Sarah Everard must have realised her fate.\u201d\nThe defence will argue against Couzens receiving a whole-life tariff for the ordeal he inflicted on Everard, a sentence reserved for the very worst offenders.\nEverard\u2019s mother, Susan, told the court she remained \u201ctormented\u201d at the thought of what her 33-year-old daughter endured.\nCouzens kept his head bowed in court. Everard\u2019s father, Jeremy, and other daughter, Katie, each asked that Couzens face them before they began addressing him directly. He lifted his head slightly but did not look at them.\nEverard\u2019s murder rocked Britain and led to an outcry over women\u2019s safety on the streets. Police fear the full details of the crime will trigger growing revulsion and anger.\nCouzens, 48, hired a car and bought adhesive tape before \u201chunting for a lone young female to kidnap and rape\u201d as part of a premeditated mission on the night Everard was abducted, the prosecution told the court on the first day of a two-day sentencing hearing.\nLittle said Everard, a marketing executive, was seized on 3 March before being driven to Kent, where Couzens killed her and left her body in the countryside.\nCouzens may have used the pretext that Everard had broken Covid lockdown regulations to stop her, the court heard. He had undertaken police Covid patrols and knew what language to use to those who may have breached the rules.\nCouzens was off duty but wore his police belt. He encountered Everard at about 9.30pm as she made what should have been a 50-minute walk home.\nA woman who witnessed the start of Couzens\u2019 kidnapping of Everard saw him handcuff her on the pavement. Little said the passerby thought she was witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman, whom she assumed \u201cmust have done something wrong\u201d.\nThe witness then saw Couzens walking Everard, her hands cuffed behind her back, towards his car. Little said Everard may have been more vulnerable to an accusation of breaching Covid rules because she had been to a friend\u2019s place for dinner during the lockdown.\nIn Kent the Met officer switched cars and raped his victim, the court heard. He then strangled Everard. \u201cThe defendant informed the psychiatrist that he strangled Sarah Everard using his belt. Given all the circumstances this would be consistent with his police belt,\u201d Little told the court.\nThe court heard Couzens had tried to dispose of Everard\u2019s mobile phone and that semen was found on her body. A fragment of her sim card was found in a car Couzens used.\nEverard\u2019s body was recovered seven days after the abduction, from woodland near Ashford in Kent, about 20 miles west of Couzens\u2019 home in Deal.",

        "content": "Impending halt to tax break on Friday cools market to 0.1% growth in September\nUK house price growth slowed in September as economists said the looming end of the stamp duty tax break had cooled the market after a period of extraordinary growth.\nThe average price grew by just 0.1% over the month to \u00a3248,742, a sharp slowdown compared with growth of 2% in August, according to Nationwide.\nThe UK\u2019s largest building society said annual house price growth fell back to 10%, down from 11% in August. That was down from annual growth of more than 13% as recently as June, the fastest since the property boom in 2004.\nThe average house price on Nationwide\u2019s measure is about 13% higher than before the pandemic began in early 2020. During the initial Covid lockdowns the market shut down completely, but it roared back after restrictions were lifted as some households found they had increased savings coupled in many cases with a desire for more space.\nPrice growth was also accelerated by the introduction and repeated extension of a cut to stamp duty land tax, brought in by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in July 2020 to sustain the housing market. The threshold at which stamp duty will be paid in England and Northern Ireland will fall from \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3125,000 on Friday, finally returning it to the pre-pandemic level after repeated and controversial extensions. The Scottish and Welsh devolved administrations ended relief for equivalent taxes earlier this year.\nThe Nationwide data shows the \u201cstart of a period of relatively restrained growth in house prices\u201d as the stamp duty effect fades, said Gabriella Dickens, a senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy.\nAlongside the stamp duty rise, Dickens added that the impact of rising inflation on real disposable incomes was also likely to dent house price growth further.\nHowever, many economists believe prices are likely to be sustained in the coming year by continued low interest rates and constraints on supply from the lack of new housebuilding.\nAndrew Wishart, a property economist at Capital Economics, another consultancy, said house price growth \u201cwill cool gradually rather than collapse\u201d.\nThat will leave little prospect of increasing affordability. Nationwide\u2019s analysis showed that the cost of a typical mortgage as a share of take-home pay was above the long-run average in 10 of 13 UK regions, up from only one before the pandemic.\nRobert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cHouse prices have continued to rise more quickly than earnings in recent quarters, which means affordability is becoming more stretched. Raising a deposit remains the main barrier for most prospective first-time buyers. A 20% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now about 113% of gross income \u2013 a record high.\nGardner added that \u201cactivity is likely to soften\u201d after the stamp duty increase, while underlying demand could also fall around the turn of the year if unemployment rises as government support, including the end of the furlough scheme on Thursday, winds down. However, he added that \u201cthis is far from assured\u201d, given the surprising resilience of the pandemic labour market.\n This article was amended on 1 October 2021 to clarify that the stamp duty threshold change mentioned applies in England and Northern Ireland only.",

There were reports of houses being destroyed with \u201clots of roofs and debris seen flying through the air\u201d.\nPhotos showed properties suffering severe damage with one house at Meadow Flat essentially demolished.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology can confirm a tornado has occurred in the Central West of New South Wales early this afternoon.There are reports of damage to houses, powerlines and trees around the Clear Creek area, north north-east of Bathurst. @NSWSES @nswpolice \ud83d\udcf7: Dean Whiting pic.twitter.com/5er71GrO2p\nClark told 2GB radio the tornado started south of Bathurst and travelled 50km in an area that was \u201cnot heavily occupied\u201d.\n\u201cAt the moment there have only been around 11 reports of structures that have been damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our crews are currently undergoing some assessments of that area to determine if there\u2019s been any further consequences.\u201d\nNSW Ambulance said two people were taken to hospital.

        "content": "Pressing, and how effectively the sides counteract it, will play a big part at the end of a particularly tough week for City\nThere is a very easy way to make good players look like world-beaters: give them time and space. Liverpool and Manchester City are piled high with quality that can rip apart any opposition if allowed to play on their own terms, so it will be incredibly important for both sides to execute a perfect pressing game when they meet at Anfield on Sunday.\nThe match could be won by the work done off the ball. City showed how to do this against Chelsea and Liverpool will be very careful not to fall into similar traps. City had 62% possession but their pressing efficiency was much greater than Chelsea\u2019s. City disrupted their opponents\u2019 plan to play out from the back thanks to the relentless nature of their attackers \u2013 something they will look to repeat at Liverpool.\nThis is a tough week for City, who play three of their most intense games of the season in the space of nine days, the match at Liverpool coming after fixtures at Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. They have injury issues and given the intensity of their play, they could risk wilting in the later stages on Sunday. It takes a lot of physical energy and mental concentration to be repeatedly in the right place to press effectively.\nCity have conceded a solitary goal in six league games, receiving credit for the defence, but those defenders will be thanking the forwards for their hard work to make this possible. The pressing at the front makes things easier for the defenders because they know where the next pass is going from the opposition, allowing them to protect the area in front of them and quickly nullify the threat.\nIt is draining spending 90 minutes pressing. It takes a long time to drop from that high because it is such an adrenaline rush. If you have an 8pm game, you will not be coming down until three or four in the morning. Recovery starts the following day but then you are preparing for the next game, so training is really short \u2013 and managing your mind and body effectively in these intense periods is imperative.\nWe will see throughout City\u2019s season that they will go for the press in peaks and troughs because no one can sustain it over a long period. They are so good in possession against weaker teams that they do not need to press them excessively, meaning City can save the relentless press for the top sides.\nPep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, like Alex Ferguson in the past, will have had a strategy to attack this most crucial of weeks, with plans laid out for each fixture. They will have had perfect scenarios in their minds, though neither side have come through unscathed, with City losing in Paris and Liverpool dropping points at Brentford, leaving both managers plenty to ponder.\nThis may divert the managers from the original plan but they have fantastic players at their disposal and their flexibility is crucial at times like this. Neither will be afraid to adjust at the last minute if they think it will aid their team in the short-term.\nOverloading attacks on the left has been a useful tool for City this season as they try to get Jack Grealish into the game as much as possible. Chelsea struggled to cope with the combination of Grealish and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and with the news that Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold is out it would not be a surprise if City looked to repeat their trick, as the duo start to synchronise on the left flank.\nBrentford showed how to get at Liverpool last week, scoring three goals against a defence that had conceded once in their previous five league matches. They saw things were not working because Liverpool\u2019s press was incredibly effective, so they got round it by going more direct. Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo caused Virgil van Dijk and Jo\u00ebl Matip a number of problems thanks to their link-up play when receiving the ball from the back.\nCity\u2019s philosophy is to play out from defence and through teams to create chances but Guardiola will not be afraid to mix things up for the sake of victory. We have seen for a number of seasons how Ederson can send a booming long pass to the highest attacking point of the pitch to quickly change the direction of the game and catch out a defence. I would not be surprised if Ferran Torres or Raheem Sterling started down the middle to give City the opportunity to stretch the Liverpool backline, just as Brentford did.\nLiverpool will be aware of how City like to dominate the midfield areas against their rivals at the top. Chelsea were unable to cope with things in the middle of the park because Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho lacked the physical capabilities to resist City.\nKlopp will be sure to counteract this by using his fittest and most physical players in that department. Despite the injury problems Liverpool have in central midfield, they have shown for some time now that they have the requisite quality and stamina to form a three to go toe-to-toe with City.\nDue to the pace of the game \u2013 and the need to break the press \u2013 it could resemble a basketball match on Sunday. Whichever team innovates most effectively to counteract the press will give themselves the best chance of winning, as Klopp and Guardiola try to best one another at their own game.",

        "content": "The new Bond movie is keen to highlight more positive gender credentials, while keeping the Bond-girl glamour. Does it work? \nIn No Time to Die, James Bond is \u201cretired\u201d and so a new agent has taken his 007 title. \u201cThe world\u2019s moved on, Commander Bond,\u201d purrs Lashana Lynch\u2019s Nomi. She\u2060 \u2013 yes, she \u2013 is a young Black woman. Lynch\u2019s casting as a member of M16 is just one of No Time to Die\u2019s interventions, designed to refresh the franchise for a contemporary audience.\nIt\u2019s a little tedious to be asked \u201cHow was the sexism?\u201d instead of \u201cHow was the film?\u201d Yet it\u2019s perhaps a valid question, given the film\u2019s two-year publicity campaign, which has been as focused on the movie\u2019s modcons (the addition of Lynch, and Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge as co-writer) as it has on Daniel Craig\u2019s departure. Actually, the same is not true of the film, which is a swooning retro romance, and lavish farewell party for Craig. It has been designed as a crowd-pleaser, with more jokes and sillier gadgets and less nastiness than viewers have become accustomed to in the Craig era. Waller-Bridge, drafted in for a script polish and, likely, her feminist credentials, has lightened the mood with her signature deadpan one-liners. In a mischievous ploy to redress the balance of the series\u2019 distinctly male gaze, there are now chances for audience members to ogle Bond in various states of undress (the women remain mostly clothed). It\u2019s the equal opportunities Bond, and Craig seems more than game.\nIn the 15 years since Craig\u2019s Bond arrived and, later, waded out of the ocean, the world has changed. Craig himself admitted it in an interview in 2015. \u201cHopefully, my Bond is not as sexist and misogynistic. I am certainly not that person. But he is,\u201d he told Esquire magazine. Even director Cary Joji Fukanaga has acknowledged that the creepy come-ons of previous Bonds are no longer welcome. \u201cIs it Thunderball or Goldfinger where basically Sean Connery\u2019s character rapes a woman? That wouldn\u2019t fly today\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter.\nIn No Time to Die, the perpetual playboy has traded his bed-hopping habit for respectable monogamy. L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s psychiatrist Madeline Swann, who first appeared in 2015\u2019s Spectre, is the first of Bond\u2019s love interests to return \u2013 if anything, a conservative tweak. I suppose it\u2019s noteworthy that unlike most of his previous conquests, Madeline is not so disposable. This damsel in distress is handy with a gun, but more importantly, she drives the plot and raises its stakes. She is, at least, permitted to wear a pair of jeans, their practicality cancelled out by the fact that they\u2019re white, and the fact that she wears them with stilettos. I get it \u2013 to strip a Bond girl of all her glamour would be too much of a heel turn. Bond is, after all, still a fantasy.\nIt\u2019s interesting then to see which elements of the fantasy the new film has dispensed with. One example is the women who can\u2019t help but fall at Bond\u2019s feet. Amusingly, the Daily Mail reported Bond\u2019s \u201cfriendly rapport with his female colleagues\u201d as though it were news. Any on-duty flirtation is briskly nipped in the bud. Ana De Armas\u2019 scene-stealing trainee agent Paloma shoves Bond into a wine cellar before unbuttoning his shirt \u2013 then hands him his tuxedo and turns around. She\u2019s dressed like a Bond girl, in a plunging, backless silk gown, but with her goofy sense of humour and athletic gunslinging, she sure doesn\u2019t act like one. \u201cYou were excellent,\u201d declares Bond, a line played straight instead of as seduction. Elsewhere, Nomi lures Bond back to his bedroom for a private meeting, making it clear she means business. Literally.\nLynch is a zesty addition, bringing charisma and wit to an underwritten role. Nomi feels like a symbolic achievement, not a character. We are shown and told of her competence and the respect she commands, but we learn nothing about her inner life or backstory. Understandably, the film wants to celebrate the fact that a Black woman has infiltrated and risen the ranks of such an institution, yet is uncomfortable drawing attention to her race. Indeed, the only attempt to acknowledge Nomi\u2019s ethnicity is a glib, tacked-on moment that sees her cathartically deal with a racist remark.\nThe film\u2019s painstaking efforts to whittle itself into a more progressive shape are hardly the measure of its success. That, I think, is down to Craig, who has managed to put his own spin on Bond\u2019s macho swagger. Throughout his tenure, the actor has dug into Bond\u2019s inner turmoil, in turn revealing his humanity. In No Time to Die especially, Craig cracks himself open, exposing a vulnerable beating heart beneath the aloof, weatherbeaten exterior.\nLynch is more of the old-school Bond mould; a smooth, charming and inscrutable cipher. Still, the film itself is tentative in genuinely considering her as Bond\u2019s successor. It\u2019s emphasised that although she might be the new 007, the title is just a number. There\u2019ll only ever be one James Bond.",

By contrast, judges have only held such powers since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 2003.\nWhile dozens of such sentences had been issued by the end of the 1980s, since the CJA the vast majority have been imposed by judges.\nThe Sentencing Council says whole-life orders are for the most serious cases of murder.\nThere were 60 whole-life prisoners in England and Wales at the end of June 2021, according to Ministry of Justice statistics.\nConvicted criminals must be at least 21 to receive a whole-life order. Those who have received them include some of the most notorious criminals in English and Welsh criminal history.\nA recent example of a whole-life order is Saadallah, 27, who murdered three men in 10 seconds during a jihadist attack in a Reading park in June last year. He had previously been part of a militia in Libya deemed to be Islamist extremists.\nMair is a rare case of someone who received a whole-life order for killing one person. He murdered the Labour MP Jo Cox during the EU referendum campaign in 2016. The judge said Mair would have to serve a whole-life sentence due to the \u201cexceptional seriousness\u201d of the offence: a murder committed to advance a cause associated with nazism.\nIn 2011, Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, became the first person to receive two whole-life sentences, after being found guilty of the 2002 murder of 13-year-old Milly Dowler. He previously received a whole-life sentence in 2008 for the murder of two young women and the attempted murder of another in random night-time attacks.\nIn 1990, Hindley became the first woman to be given a whole-life tariff, 24 years after she and her co-defendant, Ian Brady, were sentenced to life imprisonment for the sexual abuse, torture and murder of three children. In 1987 Hindley and Brady confessed to two more child killings. She unsuccessfully mounted a legal challenge against her whole-life tariff and died in 2002.\nWest was jailed for life in 1995 for the murder of 10 girls and women. She was convicted of committing the crimes with her husband, Fred West, who killed himself while on remand. Their victims were sexually abused before being murdered. In 1997 the then home secretary, Jack Straw, imposed a whole-life tariff on her.\nThe Yorkshire Ripper was given 20 life terms in 1981 for murdering 13 women and attacking seven others, with a recommended minimum term of 30 years. In 2010, he went to the high court asking it to impose a finite sentence but it instead ruled he should spend the rest of his life behind bars. He died last year.",

The American prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz reflects on the fact the number of Nuremberg defendants was effectively limited by the courtroom\u2019s size.\nThis was not merely a matter of minor camp guards or low-ranking officers, but serious politicians, civil servants and public figures. There was postwar exhaustion; collaborators all over Europe did not care to rake the subject up. With the cold war, the real enemy was felt to be the Soviet Union and a leniently treated and rehabilitated Germany (though divided) was needed as a bulwark against the communists. (Wilkinson doesn\u2019t reflect on the point, but the establishment of the state of Israel was perhaps treated by many as an alibi for inaction.) Later, there was also a persistent ruling-class distaste for the Nazi hunters in the 1980s and 90s: Wilkinson and Philip Rubenstein, former director of the All-Party Parliamentary War Crimes Group, read aloud some very unfortunate leading articles from the Times and the Telegraph on this theme, unsubtly contrasting supposed Old Testament vengefulness with New Testament compassion.\nBut now that the cold war has been over for three decades, we can reflect on this buried scandal: tens of thousands of Nazi war criminals have been living under fake names in exile, or brazenly under their own names, some in Britain (and Germany or Austria) and many reaching a ripe old age. Horror at the Holocaust has for over seven decades been an article of faith underpinning our belief in the just war, yet it has coexisted with a lack of will to prosecute the culprits. There are many interviewees here, many grim visits to memorials all over Europe and eerily blank forests and fields, and powerful contributions from survivors and survivor descendants, including Robin Lustig and Kitty Hart-Moxon.\nWilkinson arguably missed a trick by not interviewing Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, a very substantial scholar of this subject, but there is a brilliant contribution from Professor Mary Fulbrook from UCL, who talks about the chilling \u201crenazification\u201d phenomenon in 1950s West Germany, which saw ex-Nazis getting important jobs in the legal system and indeed in the Adenauer government. She points out that getting a conviction meant putting eyewitnesses through the gruelling ordeal of a trial, where they could expect derision and the prospect of coming face to face with the tormentor who would then go free: you had to prove sadistic individual behaviour. The chilling technocratic business of simply putting thousands of people to death as a matter of policy was almost impossible to convict. A sombre, valuable film.\n Getting Away With Murder(s) is released on 1 October in cinemas, and is on https://wienerholocaustlibrary.org/ from 26 January.",

Nolan\u2019s \u201csecret society of women in sports media\u201d also made me, a woman in sports media, want to punch a wall and left me feeling empowered to rebel against systemic misogyny. That\u2019s the Katie Nolan effect. You feel things.\nWhen ESPN hired Nolan in late 2017, it was a no brainer. The uber-talented Nolan had quickly risen from a Boston bartender making YouTube videos in her spare time to being such an undeniable star that Fox created its own show for her, Garbage Time. The show was eventually canceled due to low ratings (aided by a less than ideal time slot) but not before winning a Sports Emmy and earning Nolan cult status her blend of hilarious bits and searing takes on sports\u2019 most uncomfortable issues, such as her takedown of the NFL for allowing Greg Hardy back in the league. Fox knew they had a special talent but instead of finding Nolan a new role they let her sit under contract for seven months before ESPN evidently swooped in.\nYou would think a behemoth like ESPN would have a concrete plan for Nolan, especially given that her contract was reportedly worth more than $1m a year. Her own show. A weekly special edition of SportsCenter or another known ratings earner. Anything. But instead it offered a vague description of her new role as a \u201cprominent digital presence while also making appearances across ESPN studio programming.\u201d\nIn hindsight, this ambiguity already marked the beginning of the end of Nolan\u2019s tenure at ESPN, an end that became official on Wednesday. Nolan announced on Twitter that she is no longer with the company.\nI\u2019ve thought about sending this tweet for weeks and I still have no clue how to make it not make you all roll your eyes. Alas: the obvious thing has happened. I no longer work at ESPN. I\u2019m really grateful for my time here. I made incredible friendships and valuable mistakes.\nESPN has employed no shortage of sports anchors and personalities known for their humor. Kenny Mayne, Michelle Beadle, and Dan Le Batard come to mind. But in Nolan, the network had a comedic tour de force, a driven and talented creative genius with a proven track record of executing unique material.\nNolan is the kind of rare talent you build around, not a quarterback you plunk into an archaic offense. But ESPN neglected to do so. Instead of adding her talents to the heart of their universe, and finally having a shot to perfect that sports-entertainment crossover piece they\u2019ve never quite got right, they experimented with her on the periphery. Without much fanfare, Nolan was tasked with hosting a version of SportsCenter for Snapchat aimed at reeling in a younger audience. She also made guest appearances on Le Batard\u2019s Highly Questionable where she developed incredible chemistry with the host. But there was never a true high-profile role for Nolan at ESPN. She eventually launched her podcast, Sports? and was finally given her own show, Always Late with Katie Nolan, in 2019 where she offered recognizably Nolan sketches like inviting fans who troll college kickers to attempt real field goals and reading the angriest sports stadium one-star Yelp reviews.\nBut even Nolan\u2019s show was digital at first before making its way to ESPN2, again in a less than ideal timeslot. All told, ESPN never embraced Nolan, and missed an opportunity they may not have again for some time. Despite ESPN\u2019s apparent mismanagement of Nolan, her popularity continued to soar and spurred on a new generation of sports journalists trying their luck in the sports humor space. Yet it\u2019s hard to think of anyone offering the same blend of charisma, authenticity, and ability to make the viewer care about sports on a deeper level than Nolan.\nNolan follows in the footsteps of Jemele Hill, Cari Champion and Beadle as outspoken women who are no longer at ESPN. She will be just fine. Well-funded media companies will be eager to snap her up: The Ringer and Le Batard\u2019s Meadowlark Media are obvious candidates. Wherever Nolan lands, let\u2019s hope that unlike ESPN she is given a platform worthy of her talents.",

        "content": "US Congress to question firm\u2019s head of safety after Wall Street Journal reports revealed research on the photo app\nFacebook has released internal research that examines Instagram\u2019s impact on teenagers\u2019 mental health before a US Congress hearing on Thursday.\nAntigone Davis, Facebook\u2019s global head of safety, will appear in Washington on Thursday in a hearing exploring the impacts of the company\u2019s products on young users.\nThursday\u2019s hearing, starting at 10.30am EDT (3.30pm BST) follows a series of Wall Street Journal reports based on internal Facebook leaks, including a story that revealed research showing the harmful effects of Instagram on childhood mental health.\nThe research, commissioned by Instagram, a subsidiary of Facebook, showed that the photo app could affect girls\u2019 mental health on issues such as body image and self-esteem, the WSJ reported. Facebook issued an initial rebuttal of the revelations but on Monday it announced it was pausing work on Instagram Kids, which had been intended for users under the age of 13.\nLate on Wednesday Facebook released two slide decks of research that it said formed the \u201cprimary focus\u201d of the WSJ\u2019s \u201cmischaracterisation\u201d of its work on the mental health impact of Instagram. The slides were accompanied by fresh annotations from Facebook that often criticised the presentation of the company\u2019s own research, including describing one slide headline \u2013 directly quoted by the WSJ in its original reporting \u2013 as \u201cmyopic\u201d.\nThe annotations repeatedly stress that the work is not fit to evaluate causal links between social media and mental health, despite the slides carrying headlines such as \u201cteens blame Instagram for increases in the rates of anxiety and depression among teens\u201d.\nThe first deck includes a survey result that estimated that 30% of teen girls felt Instagram made dissatisfaction with their body worse, while a majority of overall users felt Instagram had no impact on mental health and wellbeing or made things better. It adds that social comparison is the top mental health issue that Instagram should care about. However, the headline on the slide cited by the original WSJ article \u2013 \u201cwe make body issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls\u201d \u2013 is described as \u201cmyopic\u201d in the accompanying annotation.\nThe survey involved more than 22,000 users across the US, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey and India but fewer than 150 teenage girls in the survey responded to the body image question. A slide that followed up with users who admitted they were having \u201chard moments\u201d showed that in the majority of cases Instagram had \u201cno impact\u201d on issues such as anxiety and sleep issues.\nA further slide shows that for teenage girls already having \u201chard moments\u201d, one in three found Instagram made body issues worse. A further slide shows that one in three people who were finding social media use problematic found Instagram made it worse, with one in four saying it made issues with social comparison worse.\nThe second deck of research released by Facebook, headlined \u201cteen mental health deep dive\u201d is based on a survey of more than 2,500 teens in the UK and US. One slide shows that of Instagram users who had wanted to kill themselves, 6% in the US and 13% in the UK said that feeling had started on Instagram. In an annotated aside, Facebook said that only 16 respondents to its survey had reported suicidal thoughts. The same slide showed that for users who felt unattractive, around one in four in the UK and US said the feeling started on Instagram. Another slide shows that one in five teens say Instagram makes them feel negative about themselves, with UK girls (one in four) the most negative.\nIn one slide, a female British respondent to the survey says: \u201cYou can\u2019t ever win on social media. If you\u2019re curvy, you\u2019re too busty. If you\u2019re skinny, you\u2019re too skinny. If you\u2019re bigger, you\u2019re too fat. But it\u2019s clear you need boobs, a booty, to be thin, to be pretty.

        "content": "Ex-Met officer jailed for kidnap, rape and murder of Everard, whom he abducted from London street\n\nWayne Couzens has been ordered to spend the rest of his life in jail after a judge said his crimes were as serious as a terrorist atrocity because he abused his powers as a police officer to kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard.\nThe former Metropolitan police officer used his warrant card and handcuffs to get Everard, 33, into his car as she walked home in south London at the height of Covid lockdown restrictions in March. The restrictions were his probable pretext for stopping her.\nCouzens drove her to Kent before strangling her with his police belt and burning her body. Lord Justice Fulford told Couzens his crimes had damaged the victim\u2019s loved ones and wider society, shattering the Everard family, eroding faith in the police, betraying his wife and two children and stoking the fear women felt.\n\u201cYou have very considerably added to the sense of insecurity that many have living in our cities, perhaps particularly women, when travelling by themselves and especially at night,\u201d he said.\nWhat earned Couzens a whole-life tariff, said the judge, was the abuse of his position to commit his crimes, meaning the court would treat it as seriously as a murder carried out for a terrorist motive. The sentence means Couzens will die in jail.\n\u201cI have not the slightest doubt that the defendant used his position as a police officer to coerce her on a wholly false pretext into the car he had hired for this purpose. It is most likely that he suggested to Sarah Everard that she had breached the restrictions on movement that were being enforced during that stage of the pandemic,\u201d Fulford said.\n\u201cSarah Everard was a wholly blameless victim of a grotesquely executed series of offences that culminated in her death and the disposal of her body.\u201d\nThe judge said Couzens spent a month travelling to London to research how best to commit his crimes and bought items to use ahead of time.\nFulford said: \u201cThere was significant planning and premeditation. The victim was abducted, there was the most serious sexual conduct, the defendant was responsible for significant mental and physical suffering which he inflicted on the victim before her death, and the defendant concealed and attempted to destroy Sarah Everard\u2019s body.\u201d\nCouzens, wearing a navy blue suit and face mask, appeared shaky as he stood to hear his sentence, listening with head bowed and eyes closed. At the conclusion of Fulford\u2019s remarks, Couzens was taken down by two police officers.\nEverard\u2019s family said: \u201cNothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back, but knowing he will be imprisoned for ever brings some relief. Sarah lost her life needlessly and cruelly and all the years of life she had yet to enjoy were stolen from her. Wayne Couzens held a position of trust as a police officer and we are outraged and sickened that he abused this trust in order to lure Sarah to her death. The world is a safer place with him imprisoned.\n\u201cIt is almost seven months since Sarah died and the pain of losing her is overwhelming. We miss her all the time. She was a beautiful young woman in looks and character and our lives are the poorer without her. We remember all the lovely things about Sarah \u2013 her compassion and kindness, her intelligence, her strong social conscience. But we especially like to remember her laughing and dancing and enjoying life. We hold her safe in our hearts.\u201d\nCouzens, 48, joins a list of about 60 prisoners in England and Wales who are serving whole-life sentences. He pleaded guilty to his crimes but the judge said he showed \u201cno genuine contrition\u201d.\nThe sentencing guidelines for a whole-life order cover cases such as a double murder, murder and abduction of a child, and murder of a police officer. By giving the sentence to Couzens for a single murder, as his abuse of his powers and role as a police officer were integral to his crime, Fulford set a legal precedent.\nThe judge had studied the case of Thomas Mair, jailed for a whole-life term for killing the Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016. He noted that Mair had not appealed against his sentence, the most severe that can be passed since the abolition of the death penalty.\nFulford said: \u201cThe police are in a unique position, which is essentially different from any other public servants. They have powers of coercion and control that are in an exceptional category.\u201d\nHe said police were expected to use these powers in the public interest, and anything less risked trust in law and order: \u201cIf that is undermined, one of the enduring safeguards of law and order in this country is inevitably jeopardised.\n\u201cIn my judgment, the misuse of a police officer\u2019s role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder carried out for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.\n\u201cAll of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinnings of our democratic way of life. It is this vital factor which in my view makes the seriousness of this case exceptionally high.\u201d\nCouzens was sacked from the Met after pleading guilty.",

The shortfall from the pre-virus peak was identical to that in Germany, similar to the 3.2% in France, and smaller than the 3.8% shortfall in Italy, although the figures predate the slowdown in the third quarter caused by the \u201cpingdemic\u201d, supply chain strains and the energy crisis.\nJonathan Athow, the deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said health services and the arts had performed better than initially thought between April and June.\n\u201cThe revised figures also show households have been saving less in recent years than previously thought. Household saving fell particularly strongly in the latest quarter from the record highs seen during the pandemic, as many people were again able to spend on shopping, eating out and driving their cars.\u201d\nA breakdown of the latest GDP figures shows upward revisions to three of the elements that contribute to growth: government spending, business investment and trade.\nThe ONS said government spending was up by 8.1% in the second quarter, up from 6.1%, while business investment increased by 4.5% rather than the previously estimated 2.4%.\nThere was also an improvement in the UK\u2019s trade performance as the economy reopened and companies adjusted to new post-Brexit rules. Export growth in the second quarter was revised up from 4% to 6.2% while imports were revised down from 6.5% to 2.4%. Trade contributed 1.0 percentage points to the UK\u2019s growth in the second quarter rather than subtracting 0.7 points as originally thought.\nRuth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fact that the economy had grown more quickly in the second quarter meant it had less spare capacity and more prone to inflationary pressure.\n\u201cToday\u2019s release suggests the economy is closer to its pre-pandemic level than we had previously thought and raises the risk that the Bank of England hikes interest rates sooner than our forecast of May 2022.\u201d",

They said the managers probably had \u201ca lack of interest\u201d in protecting women\u2019s human rights.\nAfter the ruling, Wilson said: \u201cThe events in my case happened years ago. However, the failure of the police to protect women from sexual predators within their own ranks, and police attempts to criminalise protesters are both still very live issues today. The tribunal has gone some way towards recognising how deep the abuses run.\u201d\nColin Boyd, the tribunal\u2019s vice-president, and two other judges, said: \u201cWere it not for [Wilson\u2019s] tenacity and perseverance, often in the face of formidable difficulties, much of what this case has revealed would not have come to light.\u201d She fought a large part of case herself as she could not afford lawyers.\nThe judges said she had uncovered a \u201cformidable list\u201d of human rights violations, adding that supervision of the covert operation was \u201cfatally flawed\u201d, could not be justified as necessary in a democratic society, and was characterised by \u201cdisturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels\u201d.\nWilson is the first woman deceived by an undercover officer to take her case to the IPT, which examines allegations of abuses by the state. Other women have won compensation and apologies from the police after pursuing legal action in the civil courts.\nWilson had began a relationship with Kennedy in November 2003, shortly after he began his seven-year deployment spying on leftwing groups. Their relationship ended in February 2005.\nShe discovered his true identity in 2010 after he was unmasked by activists. He was one of 139 undercover police officers who have spied on more than 1,000 political groups since 1968.\nMany deceived women into relationships while they were undercover. Kennedy had numerous relationships during his deployment, including one that lasted six years.\nPolice chiefs have claimed their undercover officers were not allowed to form sexual relationships with women they were spying on. The tribunal ruled that this claim was \u201cmaterially undermined by the sheer frequency with which Kennedy (and other undercover officers ) did conduct sexual relationships without either questions being asked or action being taken by senior officers.\n\u201cWe are driven to the conclusion that either senior officers were quite extraordinarily na\u00efve, totally unquestioning, or chose to turn a blind eye to conduct which was, certainly in the case of Kennedy, useful to the operation.\u201d\nWilson is to be awarded compensation at a hearing next year.\nIn a statement, the Metropolitan police and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said: \u201cWe accept and recognise the gravity of all of the breaches of Ms Wilson\u2019s human rights as found by the tribunal, and the Met and NPCC unreservedly apologise to Ms Wilson for the damage caused.\u201d",

        "content": "The Oscar-nominated film director has made the jump into musical theatre with a portrait  of the high priest of pop art, staged in Europe\nIn 1982, a 30-year-old Gus Van Sant was taking a stroll in New York on his lunch break when he spotted a legend. \u201cI saw him walk by the street,\u201d he remembers. \u201cMadison Avenue, across from where I was working in advertising. He was wearing a light blue, lightweight parka and a backpack.\u201d Engrossed in conversation, Warhol didn\u2019t look in Van Sant\u2019s direction but was immediately recognisable. \u201cI was, like, \u2018OK, there\u2019s Warhol!\u2019 He was very easy to spot.\u201d The film-maker\u2019s face creases into a warm smile, incredulous, as he chuckles. \u201cHe looked exactly as you see him in pictures.\u201d\nFour decades later, Van Sant is making his directorial stage debut in Lisbon with a musical play, Andy, all about the life of the high priest of pop art. It\u2019s the latest unexpected turn from the Palme d\u2019Or-winning director of Elephant, who was Oscar-nominated for Good Will Hunting and Milk, and whose more left-field cinematic experiments include a shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho and a fictionalised account of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain\u2019s final days.\nWhen we meet in Lisbon, Van Sant reminisces about his younger years, visiting his aunt Joanne who would put on musicals such as Carousel at her college in Ohio. At that time, musicals and theatre did not pique his curiosity. \u201cI grew up in the 50s and 60s when musicals were like the form within that era \u2026 now they\u2019re kind of a new form.\u201d The Book of Mormon and Hamilton, he says, changed the way he thought about musical theatre and the potential the form had. \u201cI thought stuff was happening, and I thought it applied to Andy obliquely.\u201d Van Sant is also the stage designer and composer of Andy, which is unsurprising considering he has been making music \u201cas a hobby\u201d for a while. \u201cI would make whole albums, some of which are online. Some of which we actually, you know, pressed as CDs.\u201d\nThe music in the show is made in collaboration with the Portuguese artist Paulo Furtado, AKA the Legendary Tigerman. The main theme is punctuated by 1950s finger-snapping against xylophone and a bass guitar, with era-appropriate oohing and aahing in the background. Think West Side Story mixed with 1990s alternative rock: low key, reverb-y and slightly grunge.\nReds, yellows, blacks, blues and gold all pop in the actors\u2019 costumes for Andy, heavily 1960s-inspired but contemporary in cut. Long white flowing sheets flank either side of the stage where Warhol prints are suspended, mimicking an airy, spacious gallery. The show functions like a greatest hits of Warhol\u2019s life, spanning the years between 1959 and 1967, a time when he transcended from an awkward, shy Andrew Warhola to the iconoclastic darling of modern art.\nVan Sant had originally planned to shoot a film about Warhol\u2019s life in the early 1990s, with River Phoenix set to star in the leading role. After the actor died in 1993, the project never materialised. Andy, ostensibly a new project, was conceived after Lisbon\u2019s Biennial of Contemporary Arts approached the film-maker with an invitation to work together. It coincided with the 25th edition of the Queer Lisboa film festival, which screened a retrospective of Van Sant\u2019s films honouring his contribution to queer cinema over the past four decades.\nAndy features a Portuguese cast singing and acting in English, but that wasn\u2019t always the plan. \u201cI wanted it to be in Portuguese. But because the play was travelling [to Belgium, Germany and Italy], I think English was just the sort of fallback language that would be a lot easier to apply to each location. We were going to originally cast in the United States when we first talked about it. The reason we didn\u2019t was probably just the way things were unfolding, with Covid and possibly money as well.\u201d\nAll the cast are aged between 17 and 23, with Warhol played by Diogo Fernandes, who succeeds in depicting the artist\u2019s ascent from softly spoken, shoe-gazing outsider to the mysterious, platinum-wigged creative who galvanised the art world. Fernandes called the opportunity \u201cthe fulfilment of a lifelong ambition\u201d.\nIt\u2019s characteristic for Van Sant to work with and spotlight new, younger talent. Throughout his career, he has championed emerging film-makers such as Harmony Korine and Xavier Dolan. When I ask him which new artists he finds inspiring, he picks Lil Nas X, whose videos he calls \u201cover-the-top\u201d and \u201cculturally provocative in a kind of great, amazing, in-your-face way\u201d. He talks about how the world of pop music keeps shifting and \u201call of a sudden there\u2019s this, like, thing. It\u2019s almost like when Nirvana showed up, everyone\u2019s, like, \u2018Oh! We need to pay attention to them!\u2019 Even though a week before you had no idea.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic hit, Van Sant was due to shoot The Prince of Fashion, a film about a reporter\u2019s visit to the Paris Fashion Week\u2019s menswear shows with his 13-year-old son. Will Ferrell was slated for the lead role but the project was derailed by Covid.\nIt is a curious time for Van Sant to make the jump to musical theatre. The 1918 influenza pandemic brought about seismic changes in the film business. The director has hopped between different forms of storytelling on screen, including an esoteric mini-series for Gucci (Ouverture of Something that Never Ended). He refers to a Warhol interview from 1971, where the artist is convinced that movies are over: \u201cTV was where everything was going and he had these ideas that TV is gonna get better \u2026 and all the people were disagreeing with him and it wasn\u2019t true until last year when people couldn\u2019t go to the theatre. So, he had a way of seeing, you know, projecting into the future.\u201d\nAndy is at Portugal\u2019s national theatre, Teatro Nacional D Maria II, until 3 October. Then touring.

So when it comes to women\u2019s bodies we are similarly reluctant to tell those who occupy them what they should and shouldn\u2019t do, not least because we don\u2019t know, it\u2019s none of our business and we feel unqualified because our own resembles a wheezing, badly stuffed mattress.

So they\u2019ve got to make this choice: do they want to be pregnant and have children or do they want to be referees?\u201d\nBut \u2026 what if they want to do both? \u201cWomen have to make that sacrifice. Say if they get to a certain level in refereeing and they want to get to that next level ... if you become pregnant, it can cost you two or three years of your life. Once you lose that three years, somebody else takes your position. If you want to have babies, you\u2019ve got to do it early on in your career. If you have a baby, you\u2019re out for nine months, then it takes six months to recover, and to pass that men\u2019s fitness test is very demanding.\u201d\nHaving decided it would be a good idea to say all that out loud live on the radio, Clattenburg immediately found himself at the centre of a storm entirely of his own making.

Many of the victims were butchered with chainsaws or beheaded with machetes.\nAs security forces battled to retake the Litoral penitentiary in the coastal city of Guayaquil on Wednesday, scores of bodies were found dumped in bathrooms and corridors, piled and burned in courtyards, or even stuffed into air ducts.\nA day earlier, graphic images posted on social media showed inmates from rival gangs Los Choneros and Los Lobos fighting with machetes, guns and grenades , in the third - and by far the deadliest \u2013 prison riot this year.\nCol Mario Pazmi\u00f1o, the former director of Ecuador\u2019s military intelligence, said the escalating savagery was driven by Mexican crime groups vying for control of lucrative smuggling routes through local criminal gangs. The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels both operate through national \u201cmega-gangs\u201d, which include Los Choneros, Los Lobos as well as Los Tigretones and Los Lagartos, he said.\n\u201cThis kind of depraved violence has grown as gangs fight for control of the prisons,\u201d Pazmi\u00f1o told the Guardian. \u201cThe violence; the dismemberment, the decapitation, is a strategy to sow terror among the prisoners to gain territorial control \u2013 not just inside the prison but outside.\u201d\nEcuador\u2019s president, Guillermo Lasso, back from an official trip to the US and the UN general assembly, announced a 60-day state of emergency in the country\u2019s prisons. He said he would deploy the police and the army and direct an initial $24m in state funds to pacify the jails.\n\u201cRegrettably, the prisons have become terrain for disputes for power between gangs,\u201d Lasso, who became president earlier this year, said late on Wednesday. \u201cThe state is going to act.\u201d\nThe surge in violence appears to be linked to the assassination of the longtime leader of Los Choneros, Jorge Luis Zambrano, alias \u201cRasqui\u00f1a\u201d, in December, Pazmi\u00f1o added.\n\u201cExtreme violence has become normalized in the jails,\u201d said Itania Villarreal, a former director of the state institution that works to rehabilitate inmates. \u201cThere have been the most atrocious and inhumane murders, with decapitations, burnings, even using chainsaws to carry out these acts.\u201d\nDistraught relatives, mostly women, thronged outside the prison, clamouring for news about their loved ones. On Thursday, authorities had begun to compile a list of the dead.\nEcuador \u2013 sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, the world\u2019s two largest cocaine-producing countries \u2013 is a strategic smuggling route due to its long Pacific coastline and large shipping and fishing fleets.\n\u201cThe prison system has collapsed,\u201d said Villarreal, blaming the authorities for not relocating dangerous gang members to maximum-security prisons, and for a shortage of hundreds of prison workers for the country\u2019s 39,000 inmates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very serious because the country is failing to protect the life of these prisoners.\u201d\nMore than 200 inmates have died in violence in Ecuador this year, more than double the number from last year. In February, 79 were killed as rival gangs fought for control in three prisons. In July, 22 more prisoners lost their lives in the same prison as the latest outbreak.\nThen, in September, another jail was attacked by drones in what prison authorities called a \u201cwar between international cartels\u201d. There were no casualties in that incident.\nPrisons across Latin America are overcrowded, and controlled by criminal gangs who use them as headquarters to coordinate drug trafficking and other criminal activities on the outside. Over the past 30 years, prisons in the region have repeatedly seen massive riots which left more than 100 dead.\nThe situation was made worse, said Pazmi\u00f1o, because organised crime had penetrated government institutions, and corruption meant firearms and other weapons could be smuggled into the jails.\n\u201cThe Ecuadorian state has lost control of the prison system,\u201d he said.",

Silwood posted several messages on social media targeting Sawyers because he is black.\n\u201cThe whole incident has left me extremely upset. I find it difficult to believe that in 2021 there are still people out in society who believe it is acceptable to behave like this,\u201d Sawyers told Birmingham magistrates court.\nSilwood was convicted last month at Walsall magistrates court after posting messages referring to Sawyers deserving the \u201cBaboon d\u2019Or\u201d \u2013 a sarcastic reference to the prize handed to the world\u2019s best male footballer each year, the Ballon d\u2019Or. The court heard he also posted \u201cwhite lives matter when you try and watch\u201d.\nIn a statement prepared for the hearing, the footballer said he had seen the posts while reporting a separate instance of racial abuse on social media.\n\u201cAs I read it, I felt numb and did not know what to say. Having seen the word baboon, I assumed it was referring to the colour of my skin. The word has left me feeling harassed, alarmed and distressed, and I find the message to be racist based on the colour of my skin.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cRacial abuse towards anyone, in any circumstance, is totally unacceptable, and I hope this case will serve as a deterrent to others. This is an incident that has affected me deeply, but I would like to encourage fellow players to report all racial abuse to the police.\n\u201cWe must together stand strong in order to rid the game, and wider society, of this hideous behaviour. It is widely accepted that social media companies must do more to stop the publication of racism on their platforms. I again urge them to take the necessary action required to prevent anyone from receiving the abuse I experienced.\n\u201cIt is important we all remain vigilant in the fight against racism, so please, if you are aware of racism, it is essential you report it.\u201d\nPassing sentence, the district judge Briony Clarke said Silwood was guilty of a serious offence. She added: \u201cThere is no place for racism or racist abuse online. This clearly in my view crosses the custody threshold. I assess the remorse you have for your actions as very minimal indeed. In my view, [the offence] falls into the category of greatest harm.\u201d\nSilwood had denied the allegations but was found not to be a credible witness. He was ordered to pay a \u00a3128 victim surcharge and a total of \u00a31,000 in costs and compensation.\nThe charges levelled at him followed an investigation carried out by PC Stuart Ward, who is the UK\u2019s first dedicated hate crime officer within a football unit.",

        "content": "It\u2019s been a long goodbye for Daniel Craig\u2019s James Bond. So how did he fare in his final outing, and what was it like going back to the cinema?\nDaniel Craig has returned for the final time in No Time to Die, which was released in cinemas on Thursday, six years after the previous Bond film. Here, Five readers share their reactions to the film, whether it met their expectations, and what it was like returning to the cinema.\nI thought it was a fitting tribute to the end of Craig being Bond. A beautifully crafted, quintessential British-made film. It was a story that gripped me throughout. I usually fall asleep when watching a film but I watched the entire thing during the midnight showing rarely blinking. There was outstanding characterisation and acting \u2013 nostalgic and well overdue.\nIt\u2019s my fourth trip [to the cinema] since the start of the pandemic; I\u2019m lucky that I can go to my local Everyman cinema, which is never overcrowded. I don\u2019t think I would have gone to see the other films otherwise. Having seen the Bond film, I think it\u2019s perfect to draw back the crowds to the big screen following lockdown. Debi Bose, 51, lawyer, London\nI went to the premiere at the Royal Albert Hall \u2013 it was fantastic. The film felt like a really big finale teed up from the start. I liked it a lot, but I\u2019m not sure it felt like a Bond movie. I enjoyed both 007s and Ana de Armas was awesome. It was also a really emotional movie \u2013 Daniel Craig has made a Bond whose journey we\u2019ve shared and it\u2019s sad to see him go. Safin [played by Remi Malek] was a bit disappointing at first but the more I thought about it, the more I think he doesn\u2019t actually matter \u2013 this movie is about Bond, Madeleine [L\u00e9a Seydoux] and Mathilde [Lisa-Dorah Sonnet]. It was a very moving finale. Alex Strang, 48, Buckinghamshire\nAs a longtime and perhaps unlikely fan of the franchise, for me No Time to Die was refreshing \u2013 a more sensitive, emotional Bond tempers the classic machismo and gunfire. The opening sequence made you want more, but there\u2019s enough small moments to keep you going in a softer way. Seydoux, Lashana Lynch and Ana de Armas shine, and it\u2019s the intimacy \u2013 platonic, familial and personal \u2013 that really brings a new dimension to Bond in a film that is as much about loss as it is opportunities for new beginnings.\nIt was nice to see the cinema busy \u2013 I\u2019ve been to two smaller independent venues with social distancing, but this was the busiest I\u2019ve been to in the past 18 months. There was a mix of people wearing face coverings, and the fancier seats that are now more common in large cinemas meant it didn\u2019t feel excessively crowded or claustrophobic. Also ventilation and air con meant it felt cool and comfortable. Lily Orset, 21, illustrator, Leeds\nI enjoyed it and felt it moved away from the more formulaic films \u2013 the nods to previous characters and films were more discreet and touching than previous Craig outings. It was a little long, particularly in the third act, and for that still rates below Casino Royale for me. Pete Morrison, Edinburgh\nQuite simply the best James Bond film I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve seen them all, many at the cinema. The plot, craft, wit, acting, production and the numerous hat tips to previous Bond films were simply brilliant. The denouement was up there with Skyfall. And the title is once again perfectly apt.\nMy wife and I were lucky enough to go to a screening on Wednesday as Bafta patrons at White City House \u2013 it was our first time back at the pictures. Everything was really well handled and people were respectful of personal space, and very polite and considerate. Seeing and hearing the film on the big screen was just wonderful and made me realise what a treat going to the cinema is. Andy Payne, 58, Wiltshire",

In particular, if we are pro-choice, we may be reluctant to express ambivalence (let alone trauma) about our abortions, lest we add to anti-choice activists\u2019 inaccurate narrative. They try to depict women who\u2019ve had abortions as tragic victims, irreparably damaged by the experience.\nPro-choice activists, however, have opened up spaces for people to talk about their diverse abortion experiences: positive and negative. Telling those stories on platforms such as In Her Shoes in Ireland and My Body My Life in the UK adds to public understanding of abortion as a very common event, which affects us all in different ways. This acknowledges diverse experiences and works towards destigmatising abortion.

A rise in its share price of as much as 47% has left the firm valued at almost \u00a35bn.\nThe flotation of the Oxford University spin-out has given its chief executive and co-founder, Gordon Sanghera, a fortune on paper of \u00a363m.\nSanghera has not sold any of his 10.3m shares, while the co-founder, Spike Willcocks, the firm\u2019s chief business development officer, sold 368,000 shares for \u00a31.56m as part of the initial public offering (IPO). He now holds 4.9m, worth nearly \u00a330m after the jump in value. Clive Brown, the chief technology officer, sold 191,066 shares for \u00a3812,000 but still owns 1.7m, worth \u00a310m.\nThe shares closed up 44% at 612.6p, giving the company a value of \u00a34.9bn, in the first major biotech listing in London since the allergy specialist Circassia floated in 2014.\nNanopore shares had been priced at 425p in the IPO, towards the upper end of its targeted range, which valued the firm at \u00a33.4bn at the start of trading.\nNanopore sells a range of devices for DNA and RNA sequencing, ranging from handheld sequencers to desktop machines that can sequence a whole genome in two hours. Its technology has been used in tracking the spread of Ebola and Zika in recent years, and Covid-19 variants in the past year across 100 countries. Its vision, says Sanghera, is to enable the \u201canalysis of any living thing, by anyone, anywhere\u201d.\nThe business was established in 2005, with funding from IP Group, by three scientists who met at Oxford: Sanghera, Willcocks and Hagan Bayley, a professor of chemical biology at the university. It is unclear what Bayley\u2019s holding is in the company and whether he sold any shares, as he is no longer on the board.\nSanghera said: \u201cToday is a very proud day for the entire Oxford Nanopore team, but we believe we are only in the foothills of a long and exciting journey. We are living on the cusp of the genomic era.\u201d\nNeil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cThe company has really hit a sweet spot since it makes devices to sequence Covid variants, and it\u2019s in a sector that will only become more important, attract more attention and more investment over the coming years.\u201d\nNanopore sold \u00a3524m of shares in the IPO and issued 82.4m new shares, raising \u00a3350m, while existing shareholders sold 41m shares.\nOther technology stock market debuts in London have been mixed this year, with the cybersecurity group Darktrace seeing its shares more than triple in value since its April float, while the much-hyped IPO of the food app Deliveroo flopped.\nNanopore has laid out plans to tap into the growing genomic sequencing market, estimated to be worth $5.7bn globally. At present, the company\u2019s sequencing technology is mainly used by universities and labs conducting scientific research, but it sees great potential in areas such as infectious disease, immune profiling and cancer diagnostics, food safety and agriculture.\nIt has also provided rapid Covid-19 tests to the UK government, under contracts worth \u00a3144m. Its revenues more than doubled to \u00a3114m last year, and it is aiming to reduce its losses and break even in the next five years.\nThe company has given Sanghera a \u201climited anti-takeover\u201d share, approved by shareholders, that would enable him to veto any hostile takeover.",

I\u2019ve been a nurse for many many years,\u201d Wilcox said.\nShe is now helping to boost the rates in areas with lower take-up.\n\u201cOn (Thursday) we are bumping in at Glenroy (a suburb in Moreland, in the city\u2019s north), which is not our patch but we are more than happy to stick our hand out as they have low vaccination rates,\u201d Wilcox said.\u00a0\nThe City of Melbourne lord mayor, Sally Capp, said the inner city was home to more young people, who had to wait for access to Pfizer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the youngest municipality in the state \u2013 three-quarters of our residents are under 40. That means they only became eligible for Pfizer in August,\u201d Capp said.\n\u201cThe past month of first-dose vaccine increases reflects the enormous uptake from that cohort.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a similar situation in other areas with large numbers of young people, such as Darebin, Yarra and Moreland, which are among the five LGAs with the lowest rates of first doses.\nAge has also been one of the major barriers in Hume, which has borne the brunt of the state\u2019s outbreak. Since July, when the Delta strain first emerged, Hume has had one-third of the total cases.\nThe median age is 32, meaning many residents have only recently been able to access Pfizer.\nEmmaly Leggett, 30, lives in Hume\u2019s Roxburgh Park with her husband. She caught Covid while she was waiting for an appointment to get the vaccine.\nHer GP wouldn\u2019t let her get the AstraZeneca vaccine and no clinic in her area had enough stock of Pfizer.\n\u201cI was in a coma for five days. I was in ICU,\u201d Leggett said.\n\u201cI had not been anywhere for a week and a half. I had gone to the pet store to get food for the animals and I caught it.\u201d\nThree weeks after coming home from hospital she is still recovering, can only work four hours a day and finds it hard to talk on the phone.\nShe says more needs to be done to make the vaccine available in Hume, which now has pop-up clinics.\n\u201cHume is a low socio-economic area and sometimes people see us as bad people, but we\u2019re not,\u201d Leggett said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not enough of the vaccine.\u201d\nIn the last two weeks, Hume has started to turn it around \u2013 the area has had the highest week-on-week uptick.\nMayor Joseph Haweil said the jump was because the state government finally set up two walk-in clinics.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a reflection in investment in supply, particularly around Pfizer. Once we got (that) in we saw the uptick,\u201d Haweil said.\nHaweil said he is worried about the state opening up when it hits the 80% vaccination milestone for those aged 16 and over.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a war. We\u2019re fighting the clock because you\u2019ll have areas that will reach 80% very quickly,\u201d Haweil said.\nProf Mark Stoove from the Burnet Institute said age, disadvantage and access were mixing together in lower socio-economic areas to create a perfect Covid cocktail.\n\u201cWe saw this coming a year ago. The Covid response is only as good as the weakest part of the response,\u201d Stoove said.\n\u201cThe weakest part of our response we\u2019ve found constantly to be health literacy, access to testing and vaccines, casualised workforces. These are all in lower socio-economic areas.\u201d\nOpening up at 80% means the state\u2019s hospitals would be filled by members of its disadvantaged communities.\n\u201cSo ultimately when hospitalisations increase, which they will, there will be a disproportionate number of people in them who come from a marginalised background,\u201d Stoove said.",

One federal MP says telcos are letting them down when they most need it\nLast year Hannah Sparks got a call from her partner, Will Picker, telling her he had had an accident but before he could give her any more details of what had happened or where he was, they lost the phone connection.\nPicker had been mustering sheep on his motorbike and was coming down a steep rise on their farm just outside Bigga in southern New South Wales when his front tyre became stuck in a wombat hole. He was thrown over the bike and fractured two vertebrae.\nBut the accident took place in a place with no mobile coverage, nor was he able to make an emergency SOS call.\nDespite the pain and the risk that he knew movement could cause to his spinal injury, he decided to crawl in search of mobile service in case it was a life-threatening injury, such as internal bleeding or a punctured organ.\nAfter crawling nearly a kilometre to reach a roadside, he was able to get just enough connection to call Sparks. Though the call cut out, she had a rough idea of where her partner would be and called an ambulance.\nWhen Sparks found Picker it had been nearly two hours since the accident. He was conscious but in a bad way \u2013 pale, cold and lying on his front, unable to respond to her because he was so focused on his pain.\nA helicopter took Sparks and Picker to Orange, where a team of 20 doctors were waiting.\nTreatment would reveal that Picker\u2019s fractured vertebrae were floating. They discovered that if they had moved a millimetre more and touched his spinal cord, they would have done permanent damage.\nIt\u2019s these sorts of stories that are putting pressure on federal MPs to sign on to a private member\u2019s bill by the Berowra MP, Julian Leeser, to bring greater accountability to Australian telcos. Seventeen MPs have signed the bill.\nIf passed, the bill would impose a new universal service obligation to ensure that Australian consumers with a mobile phone were able to make a call or access the internet inside their home or workplace.\nIt would also force a new customer service guarantee to stipulate anyone who was left without service at their home or business for more than six hours between 8am and 8pm over a month would get a month of free service from their provider.\nLeeser said 40% of the contact between his constituents and his office relate to telecommunications. He said he found it particularly \u201cannoying\u201d telcos claim that there was phone coverage when, to all practical purposes, calls cannot be made without leaving homes or businesses.\n\u201cIt might be coverage in their language but it\u2019s not coverage in any normal human being\u2019s language,\u201d Leeser said.\n\u201cBecause if you can\u2019t use your phone inside your house, it\u2019s not real coverage. If you can\u2019t use your phone inside your business, it\u2019s not real coverage, and that\u2019s why we have suggested the universal service obligation.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe Communications Alliance and the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association, representing the telcos, described Leeser\u2019s bill as an \u201cimpractical non-solution\u201d, though they recognised their customers\u2019 frustrations.\n\u201cThe draft bill includes measures that are impossible and/or infeasible to implement or would impose crippling costs on consumers and the industry. If brought into law, these proposals would act against consumers\u2019 interests by discouraging industry investment.\u201d\nBut Leeser said the bill was designed for consumers rather than the telcos.\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Federation chief executive, Tony Mahar, said modern infrastructure, including fast, competitively priced internet and reliable mobile phone coverage was crucial to retain and attract people and grow regional towns.\n\u201cThe NFF-led goal for agriculture to tally $100bn in farm-gate value by 2030 hinges on connectivity capability,\u201d Mahar said.\n\u201cThis includes internet capable of, for example, transferring data direct from the tractor to the home office; of running telemetry across remote watering points and meeting the business, education and lifestyle needs of entire farming families \u2013 connectivity on par with that enjoyed by urban Australians.\u201d\nLeeser likened big telcos to the big banks before the financial services royal commission, accusing the service providers of not meeting community expectations on mobile phone coverage.\n\u201cPeople expect a high standard of accountability and the telcos, like the banks are not meeting community expectations.\u201d\nLeeser also accused Telstra, as the \u201cmonopoly provider for large parts of my community\u201d of selling people equipment to boost their signal with varying degrees of success.\n\u201cThey are happy to sell them, they are happy to make the promise about coverage, they are happy to receive the money from the bills but they are not actually happy to provide the coverage. And I think that\u2019s wrong.\n\u201cPeople should be able to get the service they have paid for. And that\u2019s why we have put all these customer service measures in the bill because we really want to force the telcos to change.\u201d\nTo be passed, the private member\u2019s bill would need formal backing from the Coalition and Leeser acknowledged that while the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, was sympathetic, the bill was not government policy.\nFletcher\u2019s office said \u201cmembers of parliament are entitled to their views\u201d.",

The ACT\u2019s beloved Gang-gang cockatoo, endangered in the wake of destructive bushfires?\nPerhaps, in times of division, it is best to take a breath and listen to what children have to say on the matter. Guardian Australia asked four bird-crazy young people who they\u2019re voting for this year, and why.\nThis year is Matilda\u2019s first to be voting in the bird of the year poll, and she\u2019s already changed her mind on her want-to-be victor twice.\n\u201cI was originally going for the cockatoo because, well, I think they\u2019re very, very majestic, and I love the yellow colour that they have, and I know every bird is but I love how they\u2019re just clueless,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThey can be a bit annoying when I wake up in the morning but I do like their sound.\u201d\nAfter some agonising thought, Matilda has switched to the magpie because the somewhat aggressive songbird reminds her of walks with her grandmother, pre-pandemic.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to see her during lockdown,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI always used to stay at her apartment on a Sunday night, and she would take me on a walk and I always used to see magpies.\n\u201cI know this isn\u2019t pleasant, the birds used to swoop her, but they still remind me of the times I got to spend with her.\u201d\nMatilda hasn\u2019t done too much research yet but is \u201cvery grateful\u201d for the competition, and the memories it\u2019s brought back for her.\n\u201cI love any bird. The competition has helped me acknowledge how grateful I am for nature,\u201d she says.\nSeven-year-old Louis has his heart set on the sulphur-crested cockatoo this year. He is particularly attracted to its \u201csharp beak and long talons\u201d.\n\u201cI also like it because the feathers look very smooth. I also like it because they have nice big black eyes. I like the yellow crest, because when it goes up it looks really cool,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe oldest one lived to be 120 years old.\u201d\nIn truth, his adoration is partly personal. Louis had a particularly amusing experience with a cockatoo recently when one came and sat on his family\u2019s balcony at breakfast time.\n\u201cWe fed it pancakes,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt ate pancakes out of my hand. First, it bends down, then it opens its claw, it grabs the food, and lifts the claw into the big beak. It has a big tongue to squish it up. I think it liked it.\n\u201cIt felt cool, I was happy and a bit nervous. I would like to vote for the cockatoo because it looks like a really awesome bird.\u201d\nLouis\u2019s three-year-old brother Max isn\u2019t so sure of the cockatoo.\nThis year, he\u2019s voting for the \u201crainbow magpie\u201d, which may or may not be on the official Bird of the Year list, but is allegedly black and white in colour.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favourite,\u201d he reasons.\n\u201cI like to scare them a lot. I get my hands and then swoosh. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\nLeon didn\u2019t know a bird of the year competition existed until his grade 4 teacher, Emily Sze, alerted him to it.\n\u201cDuring remote learning and lockdown, he\u2019s been sharing his love of birds, especially Australian birds \u2026 always out on nature walks at lunch, sending us what he\u2019s seen,\u201d Sze says.\n\u201cI saw the Guardian poll on Instagram and sent it to him and his mum, and even though it was the school holidays, within half a day he had voted and emailed me, teaching me about another three birds.\n\u201cHe gets to see other people have passion as well \u2013 no other kids in the class love birds like him \u2026 kids love being in touch with what the wider world is up to, it gets them engaged.\u201d\nLeon knew straight away what lucky bird would receive his vote. His favourite bird is the rainbow lorikeet, but during lockdown he has been taken by the pied currawong, a predominantly black bird with a sharp yellow eye.\n\u201cI love the way they interact with me \u2026 they all have different personalities,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been observing and drawing birds for several years, but during lockdown I got interested in visiting the duck pond near our house and feeding them every day, and the characteristics I found were that they\u2019re not as shy as you think, and quickly came to trust me to feed them.\n\u201cI like the way they watch and then swoop for food with their cunning eyes, also being very manoeuvrable, darting about the place, swooping and soaring.\u201d\nLeon is also a big fan of the currawong\u2019s \u201cmany different beautiful calls, with beautiful meanings\u201d \u2013 so much so he has researched what some of them mean.\n\u201cWhen they are soaring about the place, darting away from the site and calling loudly, that is a \u2018danger\u2019 signal, if there is something threatening them,\u201d he says.\n\u201cA loud but continuous call means \u2018come here, there\u2019s lots of food for us\u2019, and a crackling staccato noise is \u2018help me, I\u2019m being chased by another currawong or other bird\u2019.\u201d\nThe currawong has only visited Leon\u2019s balcony once or twice, but it\u2019s always been memorable.\n\u201cOnce they fell off the bird feeder, and we were both very shocked,\u201d he says.",

But that doesn\u2019t mean birds welcome them\nDrone delivery company Wing has temporarily suspended deliveries to the Canberra suburb of Harrison after a nesting raven swooped a drone delivering coffee.\nIt has ignited an interesting dichotomy: if such deliveries are the carbon-friendly future, can birds and drones coexist, or should action be taken to mitigate any ill-effects of drones on wildlife?\nDrones delivering hot coffee? Yes. Wing delivers hot coffee, groceries, medicine and hardware to locked-down homes in Canberra and non-locked-down ones in Logan, Queensland.\nIt plans to expand post-lockdown, marketing itself as a zero-emission, low energy, environmentally-friendly, fast and safe method of delivery, which will take cars off the road.\n\u201cHot food and coffee are popular because we fly so fast,\u201d Jesse Suskin, head of public policy at Wing, says. He talks up their pro-environmental, low energy credentials.\n\u201cIf you order pasta via our app, it takes more energy to cook the pasta than deliver it.\u201d\nBut now Wing, which started three years ago and is doing a delivery every minute in Canberra and one every 30 seconds in Logan, has now hit hot water itself.\nWing hires an ornithological expert who has advised them to pause deliveries in that area while mating / swooping season occurs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare we see birds attack drones, but this year that behaviour seemed slightly more aggressive than we\u2019d seen previously\u201d Suskin says.\nBut Mike Weston says ravens pursue birds of prey as a threat year-round. It\u2019s possible that\u2019s what triggered this raven.\nThe associate professor of wildlife conservation at Deakin University says birds attacking drones is also not rare.\n\u201cDeakin is about to release a study of 275 drone pilots showing that almost 20% reported physical contact between their drone and a bird. So it\u2019s a problem\u201d he says.\nBirdlife Australia\u2019s Sean Dooley says it\u2019s hard to be sure if birds such as this raven mistake drones for other birds, or simply recognise them as a threat: \u201cThey\u2019re territorial\u201d he says. And they\u2019re not averse to attacking larger birds: \u201cI\u2019ve seen poor old pelicans or herons being hammered by ravens or magpies. This behaviour is far more pronounced in nesting season, but does happen outside of it too,\u201d he says.\nDooley says he hasn\u2019t seen ravens attack drones before, but has seen such behaviour in wedge tailed eagles, Australia\u2019s largest bird of prey. In Holland, eagles have been trained to take down illegal drones.\nIt\u2019s not just about conserving wildlife; it\u2019s also about drone delivery companies having a sustainable business model without losing too many drones.\n\u201cWhenever a bird attacks a drone, the drone mostly comes off second best,\u201d Dooley says.\nThis is certainly corroborated by Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer Mike Bowers, whose photographic drones have been attacked three times.\n\u201cIt was an expensive exercise \u2013 drones zero, birds three!\u201d Bowers says, adding he\u2019s relieved the birds weren\u2019t injured.\n\u201cThe raptors seem very determined \u2013 and they\u2019re fast\u201d he says. \u201cThey use their talons to strike and break the propellers, and the drone falls out of the sky and breaks into a million pieces,\u201d he says.\nBirdlife expert Sean Dooley is keen to stress what a boon drones are for conservationists.\n\u201cWhen properly used, they\u2019re great to accurately count colonies of endangered birds in inaccessible areas,\u201d he says.\nHe says more research is being undertaken to ascertain the safest distance without spooking off nests of endangered seabirds \u2013 the results of which will prove instructive for drone delivery services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s roosting coastal birds we need to be mindful of,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cDrones can spook them, causing them to fly off from the safe roost, expend lots of energy and expose chicks to predators like gulls,\u201d he says, calling for more regulation around such areas.\nProf Weston says the effects of drones go beyond territorial attacks and disturbing those nesting: \u201cTheir less dramatic but still significant effects could cause birds to stop foraging and disrupt their breeding patterns,\u201d he says, adding further research will highlight the extent of such impacts.\nHe says a centralised recording of all wildlife and drone interactions will help inform solutions: \u201cWe currently mainly rely on videos on the internet,\u201d he says.\nWhile waiting for more comprehensive research, RSPCA Australia suggests drone use should be minimised, citing potential stress induced by the sound/visual stimulus of the drone.\n\u201cCodes of practice until then could include: low noise production and size drones, launching and landing at least 100m from animals and avoiding moving directly towards animals as it may mimic a predator\u2019s behaviour,\u201d says Dr Di Evans, senior scientific officer, RSPCA Australia.\nWeston calls for standardised protocols, agreed no-fly zones and better training for drone operators on what to do when an aggressive encounter happens. \u201cThere might also be technological solutions such as automatic modification of flight paths and flights using sensors,\u201d he says.\nPhotographer Mike Bowers says this is all part of living in Australia.\n\u201cYou live alongside a variety of wildlife \u2013 you have to accept raptors live in our skies just like surfers have to accept there are sharks in our seas.\u201d"

She said that after initially seeking support via her GP, it took \u201cabout a year to get help\u201d, despite \u201cseeing three different doctors\u201d.\nThe rise of eating disorders among young people has been highlighted in a recent report showing that the number experiencing problems has doubled in recent years.\nIt comes amid a general decline in mental health among those aged six to 23, with more than half of young people aged 17 to 23 struggling with insomnia.\nHannah puts the rise in eating disorders down to a lack of control among her generation.\n\u201cI think that is the main thing and there is also a huge misconception about balance and what is healthy,\u201d she said, adding that during consecutive lockdowns, people were bombarded with messages that they needed to \u201cexercise\u201d and \u201close weight\u201d.\nShe finds social media more helpful than damaging, saying it has allowed her to connect with people who share her experiences. She has also struggled to get help, saying she often felt dismissed by doctors.\nWhen she first approached her family practitioner, they seemed uninterested, despite the fact that her period had stopped.\nEventually, she was referred to children\u2019s mental health services and received outpatient support, which continued until the first coronavirus pandemic lockdown in March 2020. As soon support was withdrawn, she relapsed and is now back in the care system.\nRebecca, a mother of two, agrees that getting support for young people is challenging. She has struggled to get help via the NHS for her 11-year-old son, who has anxiety-induced insomnia that leaves him lying awake in the middle of the night. She eventually paid for a private counsellor.\nThere is not enough recognition for mental health problems in young children, she said, adding that her son\u2019s problems really \u201ccame to a head during lockdown\u201d.\n\u201c[He] is an overthinker,\u201d she said. As well as the pandemic, his insomnia has also been affected by starting at a new school and moving house. After trying home remedies, such as spraying lavender on her son\u2019s pillow, she sought professional help.\nThe boy believes the rise in sleeplessness is due to the pressure his generation is under, all made worse by coronavirus.\n\u201cIn lockdown, people were stuck inside all the time and could not see friends. That made things worse,\u201d he said. He added that social media does not help, as it magnifies problems for children.\nIt is for this reason that Rebecca tries to keep her sons away from platforms such as WhatsApp, and she thinks that not being able to sleep is inherently linked to a rise in anxiety and the fact that young people are exposed to much more than previous generations. \u201cThey have also endured a lot in the past 18 months,\u201d she said.\nRebecca\u2019s nine-year-old son is exhibiting the same symptoms as his brother, although she has yet to explore whether he too has anxiety.\n\u201cI think there should be more recognition of mental health problems in young children. If the pandemic had not happened, I think there would be less awareness,\u201d she said.\nHannah agrees that education is key and said she would love to see schools talk more about eating disorders. \u201cThere is so much taught about the obesity crisis, but no one is talking about those dying of eating disorders every year,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe intervention also needs to be quicker because the longer an eating disorder is left untreated, the harder it is for someone to get better.\u201d",

A further 21% were out of at least one grade, such as diesel or unleaded petrol.\nThe PRA chief executive, Gordon Balmer, said motorists were subjecting staff at forecourts to unacceptable levels of abuse and violence.\nThe organisation\u2019s chairman, Brian Madderson, said he expected soldiers to be driving tankers by the weekend. The army has been put on standby because of a lack of HGV drivers, an ongoing problem that has prompted warnings from retailers of a \u201cnightmare\u201d Christmas.\nIndustry sources said professional haulage companies were providing last-minute instruction to soldiers about the specific requirements of delivering petrol to commercial forecourts.\nThe scarcity of fuel has reduced the number of vehicles on the road. Figures showed traffic volume down by six percentage points on Monday compared with the previous week.\nTraffic was at its lowest for a non-bank holiday Monday since England\u2019s pandemic restrictions were lifted in mid-July, according to the data from the Office for National Statistics.\nOne filling station company announced a pay rise for staff. EG Group had earlier announced a \u00a330 limit on fuel purchases at its 400 filling stations, to ration supplies. On Thursday it said 10,000 UK employees would get a pay rise, citing their \u201cheroic\u201d efforts during the pandemic.\nIt said increased rates of pay would apply across all of EG\u2019s petrol filling stations and food service brands in the UK, effective from 1 October. Staff aged 18 and above will earn at least \u00a39.50 an hour, while more senior and experienced staff will be paid a minimum of \u00a310 an hour.",

        "content": "Gabriela Hearst showcased artisan pieces handmade from leftover fabric, with Gillian Anderson and Demi Moore in the front row\nGabriela Hearst, the creative director of Chlo\u00e9, is bringing the values of the climate emergency era to Paris fashion week\u2019s top table. The Chlo\u00e9 woman, once all carefree insouciance, now cares very much.\nFor almost 70 years, under stellar designer alumni from Karl Lagerfeld to Phoebe Philo, Chlo\u00e9\u2019s USP was that it consistently made the prettiest clothes in Paris. Since Hearst\u2019s arrival last year, Chlo\u00e9 has been trying to make the most sustainable clothes instead.\nHearst and her team \u201cbelieve luxury fashion has become overly industrialised\u201d. So the rainbow-bright vest dresses on the catwalk were crocheted by hand. Necklaces were made from seashells knotted on to twists of leftover fabric from previous collections. Handbags were created by knitting more strands of deadstock fabric, and had hand-braided leather handles. The artisan-produced pieces, which the house believes are \u201cinnately low-impact\u201d, will be given the highest status in boutiques and embossed with a \u201cChlo\u00e9 Craft\u201d logo.\nChlo\u00e9\u2019s price tags are such that its overall impact on the fashion industry\u2019s eco balance sheet, dangerously in the red, will be minimal. The artisan methods with which Hearst is transforming the deep-pocketed Chlo\u00e9 brand cannot be transferred to fast fashion, which is responsible for most of fashion\u2019s environmental impact. But Hearst hopes that putting hand-knitted and crocheted dresses under the Paris fashion week spotlight can have a trickle-down effect on fashion\u2019s culture by making sustainable clothing aspirational.\nCrafted pieces will make up only a small proportion of stock sold in Chlo\u00e9 stores, but there has been some progress in making the items produced in larger quantities more eco-conscious. Clothing and bag linings have been switched from cotton to linen, the production of which emits fewer greenhouse gases and requires less water. Basket bags are now constructed from a mix of straw and recycled wool. The chunky soles of flatform sandals are made from upcycled flip-flops. This is done in partnership with Kenyan social enterprise Ocean Sole, which employs about 90 people from low-income areas to reshape flip-flops washed up on beaches.\nThe outdoor show was high-end Parisian chic, staged on a cobblestoned bank of the Seine, with Notre Dame Cathedral and the picturesque \u00cele Saint-Louis serving as the backdrop. The industry guests were outnumbered by a large crowd who gathered on the Pont de la Tournelle bridge to watch the show. In the front row, actors Demi Moore and Gillian Anderson sat on benches constructed from low impact, raw earth bricks by Les B\u00e2tisseuses, a local network which trains female refugees in eco-construction. The aim is to integrate the women into French society and bring diversity to the building trade.\nThe on-the-street setting was in keeping with Hearst\u2019s Chlo\u00e9 debut, which was staged at night on a pandemic-deserted Boulevard Saint-Germain in March. Where that was streamed online to lockdown audiences, this season marked a return to live shows. Alongside her role at Chlo\u00e9, Hearst continues to run her eponymous fashion label, which is a favourite of Oprah Winfrey, Jill Biden and the Duchess of Sussex.",

        "content": "Details of indecent exposure claims emerge as ex-Met officer Wayne Couzens is given whole-life sentence\nPolice have accepted they may have had enough clues to identify Wayne Couzens as a threat to women before he raped and killed Sarah Everard.\nCouzens was handed a rare whole-life sentence on Thursday, meaning he will spend the rest of his life in jail. The judge said his crimes were as serious as a terrorist atrocity because he abused his powers as a police officer to commit them.\nAmid signs of more troubling revelations to come, Dame Cressida Dick, the head of the Metropolitan police, admitted the murder heaped shame on Britain\u2019s biggest force as she scrambled to make meaningful reforms.\nThe Guardian understands that an investigation into Couzens\u2019s phone, which was seized after he was arrested for the attack on Everard, revealed he was part of a WhatsApp group involving police officers now under investigation over alleged misogynistic, racist and homophobic messages, sources say.\nSteve House, the Met deputy commissioner, said there was no getting away from the force\u2019s responsibility. \u201cWe should own this,\u201d he said. \u201cHe [Couzens] was one of us and we need to look at ourselves very, very carefully to understand \u2026 how was he allowed to be one of us, and what does it say about us as an organisation. Organisationally, we own this guilt.\u201d\nNew details of previous indecent exposure claims against Couzens emerged on Thursday. A man was accused of being naked from the waist down in a car in Kent in 2015, and of twice exposing himself at a London McDonald\u2019s days before the murder, with details of cars linked to Couzens in both instances passed to police.\nA simple registration plate check, available to police on systems belonging to the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency, could have linked Couzens to alleged offending, but officers failed to identify him, the Met assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave confirmed, and no action was taken before Everard\u2019s murder.\nEphgrave said: \u201cIt is one of the inquiries you could make when that gets allocated to you, absolutely. OK, we\u2019ve got this vehicle, what can we find out about this vehicle.\u201d\nAsked if it was reasonable to conclude that police may have had enough information to identify Couzens as a sexual threat to women prior to the murder of Everard on 3 March, for the first time a police chief accepted that that was possible.\nEphgrave said: \u201cThat is an obvious question to ask, and something I have thought about a lot. It\u2019s hard to think about it without knowing what we now know.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf any of those things had been in a different order, would the outcome have been different? Well, maybe.\u201d\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating whether chances were missed by Kent in 2015 and the Met days before the murder of Everard, to identify Couzens as a threat to women.\nIt is also investigating the group chat Couzens was a part of and, after consultations with prosecutors, has told two Met officers and one former Met officer they are under criminal investigation.\nThe victims commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, told the Guardian that chances had been missed. \u201cHe was accused of flashing when he was in Kent and nothing came of that and three days before he murdered Sarah, he was accused of flashing again,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhere was the red flag that should have gone up after these incidents? Surely better notice should have been taken of that. There should have been an intervention. If he were arrested for that, the chances are he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what he did.\u201d\nPolice say they have looked at whether Couzens committed any other serious violent crimes and they do not believe so. They appealed for anyone with claims about further offending by Couzens to contact them.\nA senior Labour MP led calls for Dick, 60, to resign, and said women\u2019s confidence in the police \u201cwill have been shattered\u201d. Harriet Harman said it would be impossible for Dick to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust.\nBut the home secretary, Priti Patel, said she would \u201ccontinue to work with\u201d the commissioner despite \u201cserious questions\u201d for the Met. This month Dick\u2019s contract was extended by two years, meaning she will continue to lead the force until 2024.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating whether chances were missed to identify Couzens as a threat, and the findings could threaten further damage to police.\nEphgrave said the Met\u2019s way of protecting and serving women was under review and promised extra resources.\nAsked if Couzens was a one-off or an extreme example of an alleged anti-woman culture in policing, Ephgrave said: \u201cI\u2019m wrestling with myself. It is tempting to say he is so extreme, he is an exception. But that cannot be an excuse to ignore more broader issues. We need to examine our own culture.\u201d",

Rifled for gossip and scandal, it has been condemned by Trump. But the memoir contains striking descriptions of Trump\u2019s often unusual interactions with other world leaders and his opinions of them. Even though Trump regularly stunned foreign \u2013 and domestic \u2013 audiences with his behaviour abroad, scenes revealed by Grisham are still likely to raise eyebrows.\nOn Tuesday, the Washington Post first reported Grisham\u2019s description of how, at the G20 summit in Osaka in 2019, Trump told Vladimir Putin he would \u201cact a little tougher with you for a few minutes, but it\u2019s for the cameras\u201d.\nRather more strangely, Grisham reports that during a meeting with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Trump \u201casked, out of the blue, \u2018Have any of you guys ever seen Midnight Express?\u2019\u201d\nMade in 1978, the film portrays a young American imprisoned in Turkey and subjected to beatings and sexual assault. Its screenwriter, Oliver Stone, has apologised for its depiction of Turks and Turkey.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dark movie for you guys,\u201d Trump reportedly said.\n\u201cThere was little reaction from the delegation,\u201d Grisham writes, \u201cmaybe a few polite chuckles, before the conversation moved on, as if the president of the United States hadn\u2019t just blurted that out.\u201d\nGrisham also writes that Trump told Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, that \u201cIndia reminded him of California with all of the homelessness\u201d.\nTrump, Grisham says, was not \u201ca big fan of European leaders in general. Of French prime minister [sic] Emmanuel Macron, a trim, soft-spoken man, Trump scoffed, \u2018He\u2019s a wuss guy. He\u2019s all of a hundred twenty pounds of fury.\u2019\u201d\nTrump, who Grisham calls \u201cPresident Germophobe\u201d, is reported to have praised the Swiss president for the cleanliness of his country. But, Grisham says, he found a true soulmate in Johnson.\nThe British prime minister was \u201cone of the few European leaders Trump seemed to tolerate\u201d, Grisham writes. \u201cConversations between those two, both pudgy white guys with crazy hair, redefined the word random.\n\u201cJohnson once told us over breakfast that Australia was \u2018the most deadly country \u2013 spiders, snakes, crocodiles and kangaroos\u2019. Then they discussed how powerful kangaroos were at considerable length.\u201d\nJohnson and Trump staged a \u201cworking breakfast\u201d, one of the prime minister\u2019s first moves on the world stage, on 25 August 2019, at the G7 in Biarritz.\nGrisham adds that Johnson and Trump also discussed \u201csome political figure who\u2019d just had surgery, which they thought had involved the removal of a gallbladder.\n\u201c\u2018Can you put a new gallbladder in?\u2019 Johnson asked, chomping away on scrambled eggs and sausage. \u2018I don\u2019t know what a gallbladder does.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018It has something to do with alcohol,\u2019 Trump replied.\u201d\nAs defined by Johnson\u2019s own National Health Service, a gallbladder is \u201ca small, pouch-like organ in the upper right part of your tummy [which] stores bile, a fluid produced by the liver that helps break down fatty foods\u201d.\nThe NHS also says: \u201cYou don\u2019t need a gallbladder, so surgery to take it out is often recommended if you develop any problems with it.\u201d\n This article was amended on 30 September 2021 because an earlier version referred to Oliver Stone as the director of Midnight Express.

        "content": "Video appears to show officer firing at fleeing car in incident fueling calls for removal of armed officers from schools\nAn 18-year-old woman is on life support after a school safety officer shot her near a high school in Long Beach, California, this week, sparking outrage and renewing calls for armed officers to be removed from schools.\nThe victim, identified by her family as Manuela Rodriguez, was shot while in a moving vehicle on Monday afternoon. The Long Beach police department (LBPD) said an officer for the school district was driving when he observed an altercation between Rodriguez and a 15-year-old girl taking place down the street from Millikan high school and attempted to intervene.\nRodriguez then entered a vehicle, which began to drive away. In cellphone video footage circulating on social media, it appeared that the officer fired at the car as it was fleeing.\nThe officer\u2019s bullet hit the 18-year-old, who is also the mother of a five-month-old boy. Rodriguez, who police say was hit in the upper body, was taken to the hospital in critical condition. As of Thursday morning, doctors had declared her braindead and were moving to take her off of life support, according to an attorney for the family.\nThe officer, who has not been identified, is employed by the school district and on paid administrative leave. Rodriguez, also known as Mona, is not a student at the high school.\nThe shooting in Long Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, has prompted condemnation of the officer\u2019s tactics. \u201cFor this officer to go after the car and to start shooting inside the car was totally against policy, against training, and against common sense,\u201d Luis Carrillo, an attorney for Rodriguez\u2019s family, told the Guardian. He said there were no reports that anyone was armed, and that no one was posing a threat to the officer.\n\u201cEverything went wrong. You don\u2019t shoot at a car that is leaving a location \u2026 And you should not have armed officers dealing with kids,\u201d Carrillo said, calling for the officer to be arrested and charged with murder or manslaughter.\nLong Beach police and the district attorney are investigating the shooting.\nPolice departments across the US have increasingly adopted policies against shooting at moving vehicles, recognizing that firing into a car can greatly endanger the public. Federal guidance instructs officers only to fire at a driver if the driver presents a deadly threat that is separate from the vehicle (such as pointing a gun). Best practices dictate that officers should get out of the way of moving vehicles instead of shooting, experts have said.\nThe Long Beach school district\u2019s use of force policy for its officers says they \u201cshall not fire at a moving vehicle\u201d and \u201cshall not fire at a fleeing person\u201d, according to a copy of the rules shared with the Guardian.\nSome have questioned why the officer was involved in a dispute off campus in a parking lot. A school district spokesman said its officers \u201cwork both on campus and near campuses [to] ensure safe passage of students to and from school\u201d, and that the officer was on duty and was \u201cconducting safe passage for students leaving Millikan high school\u201d.\nSince the mass protests last year sparked by the murder of George Floyd, advocates across the US have pushed for police to be removed from schools, and to reinvest those funds in programs and services for students. Oakland is now moving to remove its police department from schools, and the LA school board has voted to cut the number of police officers in its schools.\nThe city of Long Beach\u2019s racial equity report last year recommended that the school district take steps to \u201creduce use of school police\u201d and \u201creview alternative models\u201d. A school spokesman said the district currently employed nine full-time school safety officers and two part-time officers.\nAudrena Redmond, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Long Beach, said the group had been fighting to remove armed officers from schools and reinvest those resources into programs and vital staff needs, such as counselors, social workers and nurses.\nRedmond said she didn\u2019t want to see school officials respond by promising more training, but rather by removing guns altogether from campuses. The presence of armed officers in schools was detrimental to students, she said: \u201cIt criminalizes people. It normalizes being policed from a very early age.\u201d\nThere was no justification for the violent response by the officer, she added: \u201cThey were doing what happens among kids, which is fighting and arguing \u2026 and then he shot a teenager at close range. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\nRafeul Chowdhury, 20, the father of Rodriguez\u2019s child, told the LA Times that he was in the car when she was shot: \u201c\u201cIt was all for no reason \u2026 The way he shot at us wasn\u2019t right.\u201d He added: \u201cI just want justice for my girl, my baby mama, the love of my life that I can\u2019t get back ever again.\u201d\nCarrillo, the family attorney, said people from across the community had gathered for a vigil to call for justice for Rodriguez: \u201cShe was a good mother to her five-month-old child. And she was a very loving young lady.\u201d\nJill Baker, the Long Beach school superintendent, said in a statement: \u201cOur school safety officers are hired to protect the physical safety of our staff and students on and around campuses.

In March 2020 Rishi Sunak promised a review of the tax, which is expected to report this autumn.\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said this week that a Labour government would freeze business rates and eventually replace them with a new, as yet undefined system that she said would reward investment, with a particular focus on businesses investing in decarbonisation and green technology.\nBefore the Tory conference this week, the call to slash the tax was backed by the former cabinet minister Esther McVey, who coordinates the Blue Collar Conservative group of working-class backbenchers, as well as the MP Kevin Hollinrake, who has run campaigns to overhaul property taxation including council tax and stamp duty.\nTheir demand was prompted by data published last week by the British Retail Consortium that suggested four out of five larger retailers would probably have to close more shops unless their business rates bill was reduced.\nThe group also cited research published by WPI Strategy on the impact of the pandemic on retail, particularly in areas identified for levelling up. More than 8,700 chain stores closed in UK high streets, shopping centres and retail parks in the first six months of 2021.\nConstituencies with the highest numbers of vacant shops were also in the areas identified in the report: 20% of units are vacant in the north-east, and 17% in Yorkshire & Humber and the north-west, compared with just 10% in London and 12% in the south-east.\nGrundy, who holds Andy Burnham\u2019s former seat in Leigh in Greater Manchester with a slim majority, said: \u201cMy constituency is one of the worst affected in the whole of England and Wales. I\u2019m now convinced that bringing these costs down should be an essential part of the levelling-up agenda. Voters in the north trust this Conservative government to transform their prospects. We must deliver.\u201d\nIn February MPs wrote to Sunak demanding that business rates are reduced from about 50% of market rent to about 35%.\nReeves said the Conservatives should follow Labour\u2019s lead. \u201cThe Conservative government should listen, stop with the sticking plasters and come up with real action to support businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cLabour would immediately cut business rates, and in the long run we would scrap them altogether, replacing them with a new system of business taxation fit for the 21st century.\u201d\nNew data has also revealed how the energy crisis is likely to affect seats that the Tories are aiming to hold. Around one in six households in parliamentary \u201cred wall\u201d areas already have above-average levels of fuel poverty, and they can expect to see the situation worsen as a result of next week\u2019s energy cap rise.\nThree of the council areas with the highest proportion of household fuel poverty in England are in the \u201cred wall\u201d: Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton and Sandwell in the West Midlands. On average just over 15% of households in \u201cred wall\u201d areas are fuel poor, compared with an England average of just above 13%.\nSimon Francis, a coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, which prepared the data, said: \u201cThe latest rises in wholesale prices means that we face the possibility of more households facing fuel poverty than ever before.\u201d",

But they have a special gift at their disposal\nThe arrival of autumn heralds the annual cranefly emergence. There are more than 300 species found in the UK, but Tipula paludosa is the most common. As dusk falls and I turn on the lights, they flit around the glowing windows, the unwary snared by the orb-weaver and false widow spiders that have slung their webs across the glass. Those that make it inside the house blunder from corner to corner, bouncing off the walls and ceiling.\nCapture and release is a delicate operation, as the gangly insects have what are known as deciduous legs \u2013 they detach from the body at the slightest touch. The six spindly appendages, which give them the nickname \u201cdaddy longlegs\u201d, stabilise the cranefly\u2019s elongated, slender body during flight and egg-laying, and provide sensory input to help them navigate their environment, but the ability to sacrifice a limb allows them the opportunity to escape the grasp of a predator.\nThey are often mistaken for other leggy creatures that abound at this time of year \u2013 such as harvestmen and cellar spiders \u2013 all of which share their colloquial name. It\u2019s this confusion that gave rise to the enduring urban myth that craneflies are one of the most venomous insects in the world. Despite the fact that they resemble giant mosquitoes, they are completely harmless. Their mouthparts are very simple, so they are incapable of consuming anything more than nectar, let alone biting humans. Females do sport a sharp protuberance at the tip of the abdomen, but this is an ovipositor, not a stinger.\nWhile the adults rarely eat, the larvae \u2013 know as leatherjackets \u2013 are voracious, feeding on the roots and stem bases of grasses in gardens, parks and pasture. They thrive in damp soil, so a mild winter followed by a cool, wet summer has created ideal conditions for them to reach maturity. Despite witnessing starlings, magpies and crows pecking the lawn in search of the grubs, there has only been a modest hatch in my garden. Across the road in Langstone Meadows, clouds of craneflies rise from the grass with every step I take, floating above the purple haze of Yorkshire-fog and thistles.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

        "content": "Our latest snapshot of key economic indicators also finds record inflation and travel nearing pre-Covid levels\nThe number of daily new Covid infections in the UK has risen in the past month after the removal of most pandemic restrictions and as schools and offices reopened, fuelled by the Delta variant. The latest daily figures up to 30 September show that 36,480 people tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK, an increase from the start of the month. The government said a further 137 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday, bringing the UK total to 136,662. Almost 49 million people have had a first shot of a coronavirus vaccine, about 90% of the adult population. Almost 45 million \u2013 about 83% \u2013 have had a second.\nThe number of trips taken on the UK\u2019s roads and on public transport has edged closer to pre-pandemic levels as office workers gradually returned to city centres. According to figures from the Department for Transport, car journeys are only a few percentage points below the equivalent week in 2019. However, despite a rise in national rail and bus journeys, public transport use remains below pre-Covid levels. While the busiest morning since the start of the pandemic was recorded in early September by London Underground, tube and bus usage remains below normal.\nGlobal financial markets have come under pressure in the past month amid investor concern over rising inflation, as central banks consider scaling back their emergency Covid-19 stimulus measures to keep a lid on rapid growth in consumer prices. China\u2019s embattled property developer Evergrande Group has also rattled global markets; investors fear the debt-stricken firm\u2019s troubles could drag down the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In London, the FTSE 100 fell below 7,000 by mid-September before staging a gradual recovery. The blue-chip index remains 0.4% down on the start of the month.\nInflation in the UK made its biggest jump on record in August, adding to pressure on households as the government prepares to cut universal credit benefits and raise taxes on workers. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer prices index rose to 3.2% in August, up from 2% in July, to hit the highest rate since March 2012. Driven by rising food and drink prices, as well as distortions caused by the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme in 2020, the 1.2-percentage-point jump between July and August was the largest since records began in 1997. The Bank of England warned that rising energy bills would drive inflation above 4% this winter, with soaring household gas and electricity bills maintaining the pressure until summer. However, the Bank still expects that high inflation will prove temporary.\nSevere shortages of workers and supplies dragged down September business activity in the UK to the weakest levels since pandemic restrictions were eased in March. The IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index, a closely watched gauge of private sector activity, dropped to 54.1 in September from 54.8 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. Amid surging transport costs, product shortages and higher staff wages, firms raised their prices at the fastest pace since the late 1990s. Growth also dipped in other advanced economies, although UK output is below levels in the US and the eurozone. Activity in China slumped into contraction on the month.\nEmployers scrambling to hire staff amid widespread labour shortages after lockdown helped to return the number of workers on UK company payrolls to pre-pandemic levels in August. With shortages of lorry drivers, warehouse operatives and care workers as Britain emerges from lockdown, job vacancies soared to more than 1m for the first time since records began in 2001. Firms hiring lifted the number of staff on company payrolls by 241,000 to 29.1 million. However, unemployment remains 0.6 percentage points higher than before the pandemic, at 4.6%.\nRetail sales in Great Britain fell unexpectedly in August as supply chain disruption hit spending, while households switched from food and drink shopping in supermarkets to pubs and restaurants after the easing of pandemic restrictions. Retail sales dropped by 0.9% in August after a steeper decline of 2.8% in July. While spending remains above pre-pandemic levels, City economists had forecast a rise of 0.5%. Sales fell across a broad range of other categories, including a sharp drop in food sales and at department stores. Britain\u2019s biggest retailers have warned that stock levels are at their lowest since the 1980s because of shortages of workers and supply chain disruption.\nUK government borrowing increased by more than expected in August as rising inflation pushed up debt interest payments. The ONS said the budget deficit \u2013 the gap between spending and income \u2013 fell to \u00a320.5bn in August from about \u00a326bn in the same month a year ago. However, gains from a recovery in tax receipts were offset by inflation driving up interest payments on the government debt. City economists had forecast a lower borrowing figure of about \u00a315.6bn. It comes as ministers raise taxes on workers and cut universal credit benefits and Rishi Sunak prepares to set out spending plans at next month\u2019s budget.\nBritain\u2019s economic recovery from lockdown almost stalled in July despite the end of most pandemic restrictions. The ONS said GDP grew by just 0.1% in July from a month earlier, as weaker retail sales and disruption from the coronavirus Delta variant and \u201cpingdemic\u201d worker shortages held back growth. Service sector activity recorded zero growth on the month, manufacturing was broadly flat, and rising costs and raw material shortages triggered a fall in construction. Growth linked to the return of music festivals and sport was offset by a sharp drop in high street spending and a decline in the legal sector linked to the end of the stamp duty holiday.\nThe average UK house price reached a record high in August despite annual inflation cooling to a five-month low, after the partial end of the stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland. The latest snapshot from Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, showed average property prices rising by 0.7% to \u00a3262,954, beating the previous peak of \u00a3261,642 recorded in May. It comes despite the stamp duty holiday winding down; the tax relief, which was applied to the first \u00a3500,000 on property transactions, will apply only to the first \u00a3250,000 from the start of July. It will revert to the pre-Covid level of \u00a3125,000 in October. The holiday has already ended in Scotland and Wales.\nThe last official figures before the end of the furlough scheme on Thursday showed that 1.6m jobs were still receiving emergency wage support at the end of July. Although down from a peak of 5.1m during the winter lockdown, the rate of workers returning to their jobs slowed in July despite the removal of most pandemic restrictions. Rishi Sunak believes record job vacancies will help furloughed workers find jobs. However, business leaders and economists say this is unlikely because of mismatches between the sectors with the most workers on furlough and where jobs are available. Furlough was more heavily concentrated in some sectors and places in Britain. More than half (51%) of all air passenger transport workers were still on furlough, the highest of any industry, in stark contrast to the 5% average for all sectors.",

So we think it\u2019s important to have a holistic programme in which the alleged victims themselves will be the stakeholders.\u201d\nIn a damning report published this week, the independent commission found 21 of the alleged perpetrators of serious abuses, including a number of rape allegations, were employed by the WHO. The scandal led to 29 pregnancies, with some women later being forced to have abortions by their abusers, the inquiry found.\nIn total, the commission interviewed 75 alleged victims aged 13 to 43. The youngest survivor recalled being offered a lift home by a WHO driver in the small town of Mangina in North Kivu. She said that instead of taking her home, the man raped her. She became pregnant and had a child, the report noted.\nLusenge and her fellow commission members called on the WHO to draw up a plan for making reparations to the survivors once the investigation had been completed. Many victims, they noted, had complained of receiving no help and being \u201cleft to deal with the physical and moral consequences\u201d of the abuse on their own.\n\u201cSo we are now waiting for the WHO to \u2026 provide substantive reparations,\u201d Lusenge told the Guardian on Thursday.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that a strong message be sent to all those who might one day embark on humanitarian programmes and abuse and exploit girls and women. For us, this is essential. We must make sure this reparations programme is properly drawn up and responds to the real needs of the victims.\u201d\nThe report said some of the victims had suffered trauma as a result of the abuse, with some of the men administering abortion pills or injections to girls and women they had impregnated. Other victims had seen their financial insecurity worsen as a result of the abuse and exploitation. Two said that, after their pregnancies became public, they had been forced to stop their studies.\nOn Tuesday, as the report was released, the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, vowed that there would be \u201czero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse, and zero tolerance for inaction against it\u201d.\nHe said four people who were still employed by the WHO when it was made aware of the allegations had had their contracts terminated. Two other employees have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into their handling of complaints. Apologising to the victims and survivors, Tedros said the WHO\u2019s \u201ccentral concern\u201d now was providing them with \u201cservices and support\u201d.\nHowever, Dr Gaya Gamhewage, the WHO\u2019s director of prevention and response to sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, appeared to rule out formal reparations.\n\u201cWe acknowledge that we need funds easily available on the ground for victim and survivor support. That\u2019s very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, there is no provision in the UN system for financial reparations to the victims.\u201d\nMarcia Poole, a WHO spokesperson, said the body was working with UN partners to ensure that \u201call victims and survivors\u201d were provided with support in accordance with the UN protocol on assisting victims of sexual exploitation and abuse, including medical and psychological support.\nShe said: \u201cSome are receiving support through the UN system for the education of children born out of [sexual exploitation and abuse] as well as livelihood support, such as dressmaking, livestock farming and basket-making, so that they can sustain their families.\n\u201cWe need to work with others to make sure such support is predictable, effective and provided at scale, as needed.\u201d\n Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673.

        "content": "Experts say all practices, including prayer, aiming to change sexual orientation or gender identity must be criminalised\nLeading human rights lawyers and experts have called for swift action to outlaw so-called conversion therapy, which they say is degrading and harmful, and should not be tolerated in a civilised society.\nThe Forum, chaired by Helena Kennedy QC, says all practices, including prayer, that seek to suppress, \u201ccure\u201d or change sexual orientation or gender identity must be criminalised. There should be no defence that a victim appears to have consented.\n\u201cIndividuals who seek out conversion practices in the hope of being \u2018cured\u2019 are not made aware of the severe psychological harm to which they are exposed, and so cannot give informed consent,\u201d says the Forum\u2019s report, published on Friday.\nPeople who \u201cactively sought out and \u2018consented\u2019 to these practices \u2026 have since provided evidence of the severe, long-term, negative psychological impact\u201d.\nIn May, the government announced it would bring forward legislation to ban \u201cconversion therapy\u201d but said it would first hold consultations on the issue. Since pledging to introduce a ban three years ago, it has come under pressure from some faith organisations to exempt prayer on the grounds of religious freedom.\nEighteen senior lawyers, academics, parliamentarians and civil society leaders are signatories to the Forum\u2019s Cooper report, named after the human rights barrister Jonathan Cooper, who died suddenly earlier this month.\nIt demands a broad definition of conversion practices to prevent loopholes, saying it should cover \u201cany practice that seeks to suppress, \u2018cure\u2019 or change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d.\nThe report says: \u201cIt is vital that the definition implemented is sufficiently broad to effectively capture all forms these practices can take. Legislation must not allow any potential loopholes for individuals and institutions to continue undertaking conversion practices under a modified aim or false pretence.\u201d\nIt also says that an exemption for religious practices would undermine prohibition. In an article published by the Guardian, Kennedy writes: \u201cThe government is undoubtedly under pressure from some religious institutions to severely limit such a ban on the fallacious grounds that it would interfere with religious freedom.\u201d\nThe report recommends legislation criminalising condemnatory prayer that seeks to suppress or change a person\u2019s identity, but permitting prayer that seeks to help someone come to terms with who they are.\nCriminalisation is \u201cessential when dealing with human rights abuses as this draws a clear line as to what acts will and will not be tolerated in a civilised society\u201d, writes Kennedy. Perpetrators should be \u201cleft in no doubt that if they continue their harmful practices, they will face the full force of the law\u201d.\nThe government should implement legislation without delay, she adds. \u201cWe question why further consultation is needed \u2013 too many lives have already been impacted by this form of abuse and countless more are still at risk.\u201d\nAccording to government research, 7% of LGBT+ people have experienced some form of conversion practice. Campaigners say it causes psychological harm and can drive people to self-harm or suicide.\nIn the Queen\u2019s speech in May, Boris Johnson\u2019s government said it would legislate to ban \u201ccoercive and abhorrent\u201d conversion practices, but pledged to uphold freedom of speech and religious freedom. Some churches and faith leaders say politicians must not be permitted to dictate what people may or may not pray about.\nBut David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, has said faith leaders should face prosecution if they failed to comply with a ban. Activity leading to prosecution should include prayer aimed at changing someone\u2019s sexual orientation, he told the Guardian in June.\nCampaigners for LGBT+ rights have warned that plans for government consultations before legislation is laid before parliament will lead to a dangerous delay.\nCrispin Blunt, the Conservative MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on global LGBT+ rights and a member of the Forum, said: \u201cThe continued delay casts doubt over the government\u2019s good intentions and Global Britain\u2019s leadership on LGBT rights.\n\u201cThese recommendations can and should be implemented without delay, for whilst we wait countless lives are being impacted, as it implies the UK thinks it is alright to try and \u2018fix\u2019 anyone\u2019s sexuality and gender identity \u2026 Further government prevarication is no longer defensible.\u201d\nAlmost two-thirds of British adults believe conversion practices should be banned, according to a YouGov survey earlier this year. The Royal College of Psychiatrists supports a ban, saying conversion practices are \u201cunacceptable and harmful\u201d.",

I\u2019ve never met Keir, but I think you can tell we both care about people. Boris only cares about Boris.\u201d\nThe Reform UK conference, while low in profile, carries potentially significant political resonance for several reasons, not least in shaping the future of a party that won the 2019 European elections but then slipped into near obscurity.\nIn this year\u2019s council elections, the party won two seats. \u201cKnocking on doors, the majority of people hadn\u2019t heard of us,\u201d Tice admitted, but polls now put Reform UK at up to 5%.\nThe conference will hear policy announcements in areas including healthcare, tax and the environment, plus one that Tice promised would have \u201ca big, unexpected wow factor\u201d.\nHe said this would mark the end of a period in which his party has often gained attention by focusing on the culture wars and associated issues, including opposition to lockdown and a semi-alliance with Laurence Fox, the outspoken actor turned London mayoral candidate.\n\u201cYes, we get irritated by what we call the woke stuff, and I think it does irritate millions of people,\u201d Tice said. \u201cBut what affects people\u2019s daily lives are the policies I\u2019ve talked about, and the election will be fought on those things. We are deadly serious about this.\u201d\nAlso significant is Reform UK\u2019s resolute opposition to Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, to the extent of holding its conference in Manchester on the same day that the Tory conference opens in the same city. \u201cThat was my idea, to really wind them up, which I think it has successfully done,\u201d Tice said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get abused by Conservatives, which is always a good sign.\u201d\nAnother notable element of the post-Farage Reform UK is that while critical of Johnsonism, it mimics his pick-and-mix approach to policies from the left and right. Thus, while Tice would propose significant cuts to income and business taxes, these would be aimed only at lower-paid people and smaller firms. Any revenue gap, which Tice argues would be temporary, would be plugged not by spending cuts but by increased borrowing.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got their knickers in a twist about the national debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be so worried about it.\u201d\nSimilarly, while Tice is critical of the government\u2019s net-zero plans, he does not overtly deny the climate science and would like to see the government offer 100% loans for people to fit domestic solar panels.\nWhile Tice is careful to not dismiss Farage, to whom he still regularly speaks, it is clear this is a changed approach from a leader now best known for making videos about refugees landing in Dover. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Tice said when asked if it was a new era for the party. \u201cThis is Reform UK under my leadership, and these policies are driven by my focus.\u201d",

The reconciliation bill has been called the \u201cthe most significant climate action in our country\u2019s history\u201d by Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the US Senate.\nMost large US corporations have expressed concern over the climate crisis or announced their own goals to cut greenhouse gases. Jeff Bezos, one of the world\u2019s richest people, has said that the climate crisis is the \u201cbiggest threat to our planet\u201d and the company he founded, Amazon, has created a pledge for businesses to cut their emissions to net zero by 2040. Microsoft has promised to be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d within a decade from now and Disney is aiming to use only renewable-sourced electricity within the same timeframe.\nBut these leading companies, and others, either support or actively steer the very lobby groups that are attempting to sink the bill that carries the weight of Joe Biden\u2019s ambitions to tackle the climate crisis, threatening one of the last major legislative efforts that will help decide whether parts of the world plunge into a new, barely livable climatic state.\n\u201cMajor corporations love to tell us how committed they are to addressing the climate crisis and building a sustainable future, but behind closed doors, they are funding the very industry trade groups that are fighting tooth and nail to stop the biggest climate change bill ever,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of watchdog group Accountable.US, which compiled the analysis.\nNone of the companies contacted by the Guardian would rebuke the stance of the lobby groups they are part of and none said they would review their links to these groups.\n\u201cHiding behind these shady groups doesn\u2019t just put our environment at risk \u2013 it puts these companies\u2019 household names and reputations in serious jeopardy,\u201d Herrig said.\nThe US Chamber of Commerce has vowed to \u201cdo everything we can to prevent this tax raising, job killing reconciliation bill from becoming law\u201d. The leading business lobby group\u2019s board includes executives from companies including Microsoft, Intuit, United Airlines and Deloitte, which have all expressed concern over climate change \u2013 Deloitte even includes teaching the climate crisis to employees in its staff training \u2013 and have made various promises to reduce emissions.\nAnother group, the Business Roundtable, has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the passage of the bill, largely because it raises taxes on the wealthy. The organization is made up of company chief executives, including Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, who has called for stronger action on the climate emergency from governments and businesses. Other members include Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, Sundar Pichai, who heads Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, and Darren Woods, chief executive of the oil giant Exxon.\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group that includes Bayer and AstraZeneca among its members, has run adverts attacking the proposed bill. The Rate Coalition, another lobby group that has Disney, FedEx and Verizon as members, is also planning an advertising blitz to help kill off the legislation while the National Association of Manufacturers \u2013 backed by Johnson&Johnson, Dow and Goodyear \u2013 has said it is attempting to upend the bill \u201cin every way you can imagine\u201d.\nThis blitz threatens legislation that already faces a perilous path through Congress, with the president needing every Senate Democrat to vote for the package for it to pass. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia who is a major recipient of donations from the fossil fuel industry, has said the climate section of the bill \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and has demanded that subsidies for coal, oil and gas remain in place. Republicans universally oppose the bill.\nIf enacted, the bill would establish a system to phase out emissions from the US electricity system, provide payments to prop up carbon-free nuclear energy and support the adoption of electric vehicles.\nAs the first major attempt at climate legislation in more than a decade, the bill comes at a time when scientists warn the world is rapidly running out of time to avoid catastrophic climate change. The legislation\u2019s failure would not only wound Biden politically, it would also likely hinder attempts to prod other countries into more drastic action at crucial upcoming UN climate talks in Scotland.\n\u201cThis is a historic chance to end fossil fuel subsidies and invest in a livable future,\u201d said Lukas Ross, climate program manager at Friends of the Earth. \u201cWe can\u2019t waste this opportunity to pass meaningful climate legislation because there might not be another.\u201d",

A reduction in VAT has helped many of our businesses survive to this point and was most welcome.\n\u201cHowever, the return of VAT to its pre-pandemic level next year would curtail investment, restrict growth, set back our tourism recovery and risk yet more painful job losses.\u201d\nThe letter was signed by the heads of UKHospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, the British Institute of Innkeeping, Tourism Alliance and the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now calling on the chancellor to commit to introducing a permanent 12.5% rate of VAT in his upcoming budget, later this month,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis will help protect jobs and continue the support for our hospitality and tourism businesses, which contribute hugely to the nation\u2019s economic and social wellbeing.\u201d\nThe hospitality leaders said their sector had been the hardest hit in the economy, with collective income down by \u00a3100bn. They said 12,000 businesses had permanently closed as a result of the pandemic and 660,000 people had lost their jobs in the industry.\nA survey of more than 800 members\u2019 businesses found that 77% thought the reduced VAT rate was \u201cimportant or crucial to viability\u201d, while 60% said that if the VAT rate were increased to 20% in April they would have to cut jobs, and one in 10 companies said they would probably close down altogether.\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said: \u201cWith the right support and conditions, the sector has the potential to be at the forefront of the economic recovery.\n\u201cIn order to drive further job creation, we urge government to implement a long-overdue reform of business rates and a permanently lower rate of VAT for hospitality and tourism in order to help fragile businesses back on their feet.\u201d\nBusinesses are warning consumers to expect price rises from Friday as they pass on the cost of the tax and other rising costs to consumers.\nSacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and a co-founder of Parklife festival, said he expected that drink prices in pubs would rise by 7-10% as a result of the change.\nA survey by the pub trade newspaper the Morning Advertiser found that 63% of publicans were expecting to increase their prices.\nJD Wetherspoon has said it will increase the price of its food by 40p a meal from Friday to reflect the VAT change. The chain, which has 860 pubs, said the VAT increase would \u201cmake the entire hospitality industry less competitive\u201d.",

Those in the few shelters still open fear what lies ahead\nZari was seven years old when her parents died, forcing her to move in with her uncle. But when he died four years later, his two widows beat Zari and forced her to work long hours weaving carpets. During her teenage years, Zari tried to kill herself.\nAfter her suicide attempt, Zari, now 28, moved into a shelter for abused women. For the past eight years she has held on to the belief that things would get better. She made friends and learned to sew clothes, eventually teaching others to do the same.\nBut with the Taliban now in control of Afghanistan, she risks losing everything all over again.\nShortly after the hardline group swept to power in mid-August, ending the American-led war, the small shelter sent several of its residents home. Zari and four other women who also have no family are the only ones remaining.\nOvernight, the unmarked building tucked away in the Afghan capital went from her sanctuary to a place of danger. \u201cThe (staff) curse us, they tell us, \u2018Your life is in your own hands. You can go anywhere you want.\u2019 I am scared. I don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d said Zari, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition that we didn\u2019t use her real name.\nThe shelter is one of nearly 30 such facilities in Afghanistan. Built up over the past 20 years, they operated as a discreet and often hidden part of the international community\u2019s commitment to advancing the rights of Afghan women. Most of the women\u2019s cases were resolved within months, but some spent years at the shelter, learning new skills so they could reintegrate into society.\nOver the past six weeks, this crucial lifeline has all but disappeared. Most of the shelters have closed their doors at the request of the Taliban, meaning women have either been sent home, often back to their abusers, or moved to secret locations. For those still operating, such as Zari\u2019s, the future is uncertain. Of the three shelter directors who spoke to the Guardian, none are taking in new women.\nThe fate of the shelters symbolises the struggle for gender equality and the capacity to tackle violence against women in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Islamist group has closed the women\u2019s affairs ministry, replacing it with the headquarters for its \u201cmorality police\u201d, created an all-male government and banned girls from attending secondary school. Human Rights Watch has documented Taliban abuses against women since they took over, including seeking out high-profile women, compulsory dress codes and denying freedom of movement outside their homes.\nMahbooba Seraj, a veteran women\u2019s rights activist and manager of a shelter for 30 women in Kabul, says the Taliban are still figuring out what to do about women\u2019s refuges. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid that women in the shelters will leave, and end up on the streets and enter prostitution, which is very possible,\u201d she says by phone from Kabul. \u201cAnd they do not want that.\u201d\nTwo weeks ago, 15 Taliban police officers , including secret police, visited Seraj\u2019s shelter over several days, noting residents\u2019 names and snooping around. The women wore veils so they could not be identified, Seraj said.\nSeraj told the Taliban that their visit was exceptional \u2013 a man had never crossed her shelter\u2019s threshold before. \u201cThey looked at me as if they didn\u2019t believe me. And one policeman asked, \u2018Even the Americans?\u2019 I laughed and said, \u2018Neither American nor Afghan. Period.\u2019 Why they thought Americans visited is beyond me.\u201d\nNow Seraj, the 73-year-old founder of the Afghan Women\u2019s Network, an umbrella rights group, wants to know what the Taliban are planning for abused women. Even before the group seized power, Afghanistan regularly topped the list of countries with the poorest protections for women.\n\u201cThe problems of the women of Afghanistan are the same as they were before the Taliban came to power. Women are still being abused, still have abusive families and are still drug addicts.\u201d Despite a landmark 2009 law on the elimination of violence against women, more than half of all Afghan women reported physical abuse and of those who were married, 59% were in forced unions, according to government studies.\nThe past 20 years have proved how invaluable protection services are for Afghan society, said Kevin Schumacher, deputy executive director at Women for Afghan Women, a New York-based nonprofit that manages the largest network of shelters in the country. \u201cNext time there\u2019s a gross violation of human rights \u2026 and the victim happens to be a woman, where is she going to go? Society does not function based on our ideological views. If the Taliban want to run a country, they need to have answers for these very real social needs.\u201d\nHowever, this is not the first time Afghan women have been at risk of losing their safe houses. The previous, American-backed government repeatedly tried to bring the shelters under its control, describing them as corrupt brothels full of drug-addled women. In 2011, the government wanted to subject women entering shelters to medically baseless and humiliating \u201cvirginity tests\u201d. International donors who fund the refuges successfully prevented the takeover.\nThe US state department, which had split funding of the shelters with the UN, estimates that about 2,000 women and girls \u2013 mostly in Kabul \u2013 have used the shelters each year. A state department spokesperson said it spent $11m (\u00a38m) on the shelters annually.\nIt is now unclear what funding, if any, the shelters can expect. Afghanistan is bracing for economic collapse and humanitarian disaster, compounded by the worst drought in decades. During the Nato-led war, foreign aid propped up the Afghan economy, and its fate will now depend on whether or not the Taliban can garner support from its former enemies. Despite the Taliban\u2019s plea to the UN last week for legitimacy, no country has recognised its government.\nEarlier this month the UN managed to secure $1.2bn in emergency support for Afghanistan, but there is no guarantee these funds will be gender-sensitive. A 2019 report by the International Rescue Committee found that only 0.2% of global humanitarian funding from 2016\u201318 addressed gender-based violence.\n\u201cAs donors look to try to stem the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan they should remember to put some of that effort specifically toward helping women,\u201d said Heather Barr, associate director of the women\u2019s rights division at Human Rights Watch. \u201cAs the Taliban have cut off so many women\u2019s ability to earn a living, it is also urgently important to save, as much as possible, protection services for women and girls facing violence.\u201d\nWhen a Kabul-based shelter that once housed 80 women closed during the Taliban takeover, its cook lost her income as well as a way to provide for her extended family. \u201cMy mother and I were the breadwinners but now we both sit at home, not knowing how we will survive,\u201d says the 30-year-old, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nSince last year she cooked, twice a day, receiving \u00a3190 a month and independence from her abusive husband, who was a crystal meth addict. Her mother, who was the cook at another shelter funded by the same western NGO, also lost her job.\n\u201cNow that I am locked up in my house, I suffer a lot, mentally and financially,\u201d the daughter says. She fears for her own two daughters, who were meant to enter secondary school next year. \u201cAs an illiterate Afghan woman, I was working to help my two daughters go to school but now they can\u2019t even get an education.\u201d\n In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247.

In 1968, all four Beatles (Ringo Starr carrying a second suitcase full of tins of Heinz baked beans) went to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\u2019s ashram in Rishikesh in the foothills of the Himalayas, where they earnestly pursued transcendental meditation, experienced a summer of spiritual love and wound up composing most of the songs on the White Album.\nThe film rehearses the theory that with their manager Brian Epstein\u2019s death in 1967, the Beatles needed a new guru, and duly fell for the Maharishi, whom they later found to be manipulative and grasping. Yet perhaps they reached this conclusion as a result of being manipulated by another guru, the supposed tech visionary Alexis \u201cMagic Alex\u201d Mardas, who became a malign influence on the chaotic business affairs of the Beatles\u2019 Apple Corps.\nMaybe the Indian influence on the Beatles\u2019 music didn\u2019t last, but India\u2019s own prestige, its soft power in the west, was immeasurably enhanced.\n The Beatles and India is released on 4 October on digital platforms.",

Mako, who, like other princesses who marry commoners will have to leave the imperial family, has said she will forgo a $1m (\u00a3742,000) payment traditionally given to women who give up their royal status.\nThe decision, unprecedented in the postwar period, is being seen as an attempt to ward off yet more public criticism, since the payment is funded by the taxpayer.\nThe wedding itself will be shorn of the ritual usually on display when a member of the imperial family ties the knot.\nThe couple will not have an official engagement ceremony and will forgo a formal meeting with Mako\u2019s uncle, Emperor Naruhito, before the wedding. Instead, they will register their marriage at a government office before moving to New York, where Komuro has lined up a job with a leading law firm.\nBut the couple is expected to continue to attract media attention on the other side of the Pacific. Just before his recent visit to Japan, his first trip home for three years, Komuro was reportedly chased through the streets of New York by Japanese reporters.\nKomuro and Mako, who can never be a reigning empress due to Japan\u2019s male-only succession law, will leave behind a deeply divided Japanese public. In a poll by the Mainichi newspaper, 38% of respondents supported the marriage, while 35% opposed it and 26% expressed no interest. Aera, a weekly magazine, found that just 5% of respondents felt like celebrating the marriage, while 91% said they were in no mood to share in the couple\u2019s joy.\n\u201cEven the most minuscule details \u2013 like his hair \u2013 have became fodder for daytime television,\u201d said Akinori Takamori, an expert on the imperial family who is a lecturer at Kokugakuin University in Tokyo, and suggested that media scrutiny of Komuro\u2019s family amounted to a human rights violation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not desirable to have the people split over this matter when the imperial family should be a symbol of unity for the country.\u201d\nMako\u2019s parents have hardly been effusive in their support. Earlier this month her mother, Crown Princess Kiko, said she would respect her daughter\u2019s feelings \u201cas much as possible\u201d, adding: \u201cWhile there have been matters that I could empathise with, there were also areas where our opinions differed.\u201d\nAkishino, who is first in line to the throne, said last December that he \u201capproved\u201d of the marriage, \u201cif marriage is what they truly want\u201d.",

However, it has struggled to find staff in some areas, such as holiday hotspots.\n\u201cSome areas of the country, especially \u2018staycation\u2019 areas in the West Country and elsewhere, have found it hard to attract staff,\u201d Martin said.\nThe \u00a3195m loss before tax is only the second time the pub chain has fallen into the red since it was publicly listed in 1984, as national closures for 19 weeks, and a range of regional and local lockdowns, took their toll on pub visits. The loss, for the year ending 25 July, compared with a \u00a3105m loss the previous year.\nRevenues declined 39% to \u00a3772m as bar sales fell by 42.2%, food sales dropped 37.4%, slot and fruit machine sales more than halved to 52.5% and hotel room sales decreased by 27.1%.\n\u201cPubs have been at the forefront of business closures during the pandemic, at great cost to the industry \u2013 but at even greater cost to the Treasury,\u201d Martin said.\n\u201cIn the last year, the country moved, in succession, from lockdown, to \u2018eat out to help out\u2019, to curfews, to firebreaks, to pints with a substantial meal only, to different tier systems and to further lockdowns. Pub management teams, and indeed the entire hospitality industry, had an almost impossible burden in trying to communicate often conflicting and arbitrary rules to customers.\u201d\nWetherspoon\u2019s said business was rapidly picking up \u2013 excluding its airport pubs, which are struggling as travel remains depressed \u2013 with like-for-like sales of only 4.9% on 2019 levels in the last four weeks.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s thirst is not yet quenched,\u201d said Alastair Reid, a leisure sector analyst at Investec. \u201cA variety of actions ensured the company emerged from the crisis in robust health, and the improving trajectory of revenue growth shows they are well positioned to take advantage of the recovery over time.\u201d\nWetherspoon\u2019s said that during its last financial year it opened five pubs and sold or closed 16, resulting in a trading estate of 861 pubs as of 25 July. The company said it paid out \u00a36.2m in staff redundancy and restructuring payments.\nRival pub groups such as Mitchells & Butlers reported a return to pre-pandemic sales levels over the summer. However, Wetherspoon\u2019s is more reliant than rivals on airport sites and city centre pubs, both of which have been slower to experience a recovery in customer numbers.\n\u201cWetherspoon is cautiously optimistic about the outcome for the financial year, on the basis that there is no further resort to lockdowns or onerous restrictions,\u201d Martin said.\nHowever, Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, warned that staff shortages may become more of a problem as the issue continues to grow across many sectors of the UK economy.\n\u201cThere is limited mention from Wetherspoon\u2019s of supply chain and staffing problems in its results, beyond some difficulties in attracting people in \u2018staycation\u2019 hotspots,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is somewhat surprising and it may become more of an issue for the business moving forward.\u201d",

Using an old face-powder brush, I daubed a little of each powder between my thighs. The mix worked well on a brisk walk to the shops but it couldn\u2019t contend with an hour of tennis: I\u2019d applied it underneath my sports bra, but it congealed with my sweat to make a sort-of \u201cunderboob\u201d paste.\nThe verdict\n On a warm day, I felt zero thigh chafe, but it left an unfortunate white gunge all over my clothes. Worse, cornflour and arrowroot are sugars, which can trigger yeast production (unless they\u2019re cosmetic-grade or preserved). So when a friend said I smelled \u201ca bit like sourdough\u201d, that sent me straight back to my dusting powder.",

Such deftness is perhaps due to the fact that director Philipp Virus is the brother-in-law of J Mascis, who, along with Lou Barlow and Murph, made up the band\u2019s original lineup. It is a portrait of a groundbreaking period in American music that also doubles as a poignant rumination on friendship and personal growth.\nFormed in the mid-1980s, the original trio \u2013 two of whom were high-school friends \u2013 had a ragged wildness, straddling heavy metal and punk rock. Reserved and shy offstage, the three members were uncomfortable with the social side of the music business. Nevertheless, in spite of a slow start, Dinosaur Jr gradually moved from the underground to be more commercially viable, touring with the likes of Sonic Youth and Nirvana. With success, however, came creative compromises and internal conflicts, triggering the departure of Barlow and Murph.\nAmid such intense ups and downs, what makes Freakscene so engaging is its decision to put Dinosaur Jr\u2019s music front and centre, with numerous audio and live performance excerpts. Interviews with the trio, and other artists such as Sonic Youth\u2019s Kim Gordon, are shot in an unpolished style that mimics VHS rips of the band\u2019s filmed gigs. The most moving movements are captured during a reunion concert celebrating Dinosaur Jr\u2019s 30th anniversary; now older and mellower, the men have put aside their differences. All that matters is the music.\n Freakscene: The Story of Dinosaur Jr is released on 1 October in cinemas.",

While many older member records and records of petition campaigns do show such addresses, Guardian attempts to contact them resulted in extensive email bounces and notices that the addresses did not exist.\nSimilarly, many private addresses were associated with explicit calls for military and law enforcement volunteers.\nIn each case, it was not immediately clear whether all the addresses represented currently serving military or law enforcement officers, and in some cases it was not clear if or when the email addresses were valid.",

Fifa 22 is absolutely packed with modes and options allowing you to experience every facet of the beautiful game, whether that\u2019s role-playing as a young professional scoring a tournament-winning goal for Barcelona, or knocking a ball about on an Italian backstreet with a bunch of pals. The Fifa series wants to be all things to all fans, and Fifa 22 gets closer than ever.\nAt its heart is EA Sports\u2019 endlessly evolving match engine, which has historically favoured flashy moves and spectacular goals over tactical brilliance. The studio has made stuttering moves away from this model in the past, but Fifa 22 definitely feels more sober and structured than its predecessor. Improved ball physics, an array of new player animations and changes to the pace of turns and passes make for a game that encourages smart, patient buildup play, while the options to control and communicate with AI team-mates require you to keep a close eye on what everyone else is doing, utilising their little sleights and sprints in creative ways.\nI do love playing as Man City, watching De Bruyne stalking about outside the 18-yard box and Jack Grealish cutting in from the left with truly authentic speed and purpose before being fouled. (I also like the fact that every time I\u2019ve played a Manchester derby so far, it\u2019s been raining \u2013 how\u2019s that for realism?) As with Pro Evolution in its early 2000s heyday, you get little glimpses of how the professionals think, plan and execute. Paul Gascoigne once said in an interview that he sees a match three passes in advance, and I think that\u2019s what Fifa 22, with its angular, slightly halting action, wants to capture.\nOutside of the matches themselves is the giant multiplex of football that Fifa has become. You can play the Career Mode, which offers a narrative journey from average squad player to Messi-like football god, or try Pro Clubs, which lets you join an online team with 10 other players. Then there\u2019s Volta Football, a whole street football subsection that works like the old Fifa Street titles, rewarding flashy tricks and providing special moves to create a dynamic and histrionic style of urban footie. It\u2019s like having a kickabout with mates at the local five-a-side pitch \u2013 if your mates all played like Lisa Zimouche. Fifa 22 adds news skills to the mix, as well as signature moves such as improved striking and faster pace, which boost your abilities for short periods. Most interesting though is the Volta Arcade mode, with potentially hilarious mini-game versions of dodgeball and foot tennis played in small online teams. It reminds me of the brilliant training exercises in Sega\u2019s Virtua Tennis series, and it\u2019s nice to have these fun little diversions to dip into.\nAnd then there is the elephantine moral quandary in the room: Ultimate Team. As ever, Fifa\u2019s trading card mode encourages you to buy randomised packets of player cards, like digital Panini stickers, which can be used to build your own dream team before competing in a range of online tournaments. It is absolutely loaded with shrewdly implemented progress gates and reward systems, all geared towards pinging your dopamine receptors and getting you to make just one more packet purchase. Last year\u2019s game added the chance to preview a pack before paying\u2013 but apart from being slightly more generous with its in-game currency, Fifa 22 does little to build on this concession towards ethical practice. As flashy and compelling as the mode is, it still feels like you\u2019re handing your kids a Ronaldo-sponsored fixed-odds betting terminal.\nFifa 22 is absolutely unmistakably a Fifa game \u2013 it has the sophistication and polish we\u2019ve come to expect, with all the player likenesses, authentic stadia and recognisable commentators we see every year. But right at the core of it is a match engine that feels more surefooted than ever, at a time when the game\u2019s more tactically complex rival Pro Evolution Soccer has been relegated to a free-to-play existence with all the compromises that will inevitably entail. If you can live with the loot-box trickery of Ultimate Team, this is a gigantic, rewarding simulation that offers a ton of variety and scope, and many, many moments of exquisite goalmouth drama.",

You felt you could breathe the freedom,\u201d said Ca\u00edque Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1, one of the organizers of that historic rally, which helped catapult South America\u2019s biggest country towards a new democratic era \u2013 which some now fear is under threat.\nThis Saturday, Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1, now 70, will return to the same streets outside Rio\u2019s Candel\u00e1ria church for what he hopes will be a similarly forceful demonstration of popular resolve \u2013 this time targeting his country\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, whose authoritarian idols the septuagenarian communist once helped evict.\n\u201cBrazil cannot take what\u2019s happening any more. It\u2019s one crisis after the next,\u201d said Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1, who is again helping coordinate the demo and believes Bolsonaro\u2019s assault on democracy and handling of a Covid outbreak that has killed nearly 600,000 Brazilians mean he must be impeached.\nAs objectors intensified their campaign against Bolsonaro, with plans for rallies in dozens of major cities, Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 urged them to seek inspiration from the broad political coalition that helped defeat the 1964-85 dictatorship.\nHow did it begin?\nBrazil\u2019s leftist president, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.\nThe repression intensified under Castelo Branco\u2019s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.\nWhat happened during the dictatorship?\nSupporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d.\nIt also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay.\nBut the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.\nIt was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil\u2019s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.\nHow did it end?\nPolitical exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.\nBut the pro-democracy \u201cDiretas J\u00e1\u201d (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.\nCivilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.\nOn stage at the 1984 rally stood an improbable alliance of political heavyweights, including Rio\u2019s leftist governor Leonel Brizola and the future president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and conservatives such as Tancredo Neves and the 90-year-old Catholic lawyer Sobral Pinto.\n\u201cThese were people with totally different political projects but one common objective,\u201d said Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1. \u201cThey had different ideas about the economy, social issues and the country\u2019s development but they shared one goal: that we should have [direct presidential] elections.\u201d\nSuch unity has so far largely eluded those battling Bolsonaro, despite the social, economic and environmental havoc that has played out since the rightwing radical took office in January 2019.\nSome on Brazil\u2019s right have disavowed the extremist leader they helped elect but refused to join the left-led street protests that have been taking place since May. When one rightwing group recently called anti-Bolsonaro protests, they were widely shunned by the left.\nThiago S\u00fcssekind, a student leader helping organize Saturday\u2019s rally \u2013 which will be followed by another on 15 November \u2013 said he hoped Bolsonaro\u2019s foes were finally coalescing, as the extent of the danger he posed sunk in.\n\u201cBolsonaro is a threat to democracy, and when democracy is at stake whatever ideological differences we might have pale into insignificance,\u201d said S\u00fcssekind, 22, who leads the Rio chapter of the centrist group Acredito.\n\u201cWhen you have a president threatening not to hold elections, threatening the supreme court and threatening a coup, you need to join forces. One group won\u2019t stop this on its own. The only way to effectively respond is by uniting the right, the left and the centre,\u201d S\u00fcssekind added, citing the 1984 pro-democracy movement as a model.\nNot everyone believes such an alliance is possible \u2013 or that large sections of the opposition even want Bolsonaro impeached.\nThomas Traumann, a Rio-based political commentator, said the centre-right Brazilian Social Democracy party (PSDB) appeared more focused on deciding which of its leaders would challenge Bolsonaro in next October\u2019s presidential contest, which polls suggest the embattled incumbent will lose. The leftist Workers\u2019 party (PT) seemed inclined to allow Bolsonaro\u2019s political meltdown to continue for another year until its candidate, Lula, could trounce him in the 2022 vote. \u201cEveryone wants to face a weak Bolsonaro,\u201d said Traumann, who believes Bolsonaro will probably see out his four-year term.\nPerhaps the opposition\u2019s only chance of preventing that happening was with a massive show of force this weekend. \u201cThey need to get more than a million people into the streets,\u201d Traumann said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do it now, forget it.\u201d\nRegina Helena Bastos, a retired teacher who took part in the 1984 march, also doubted whether left and right would manage to unite against Bolsonaro, as they once did in favour of democracy.\n\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t see hope or union,\u201d sighed the 72-year-old who said anger, rather than optimism would drive her to join Saturday\u2019s rally.\n\u201cBack then [in 1984] it was a feeling of: \u2018Wow! How incredible! Here I am. Everyone\u2019s singing.\u2019 It was beautiful,\u201d she reminisced.\nToday, Bastos felt despair over the future of the country of her five grandchildren, whose names are tattooed onto her right wrist. \u201cBolsonaro represents everything that is bad: sewage, rottenness, shame, decay, the abyss,\u201d she said. \u201cI just cannot understand how this man was elected.\u201d\nTibiri\u00e7\u00e1 was more upbeat about the opposition\u2019s prospects as it prepared for two crucial mobilizations. \u201cMy sense is that it will be big,\u201d he said of Saturday\u2019s protest, outlining his reasons for wanting Bolsonaro out. \u201cI lived through one dictatorship \u2013 I don\u2019t want to live through another.\u201d\nS\u00fcssekind was 15 years away from being born in 1984, when central Rio witnessed one of the largest demonstrations in Brazilian history. But as he prepared to march this weekend, the student activist said he felt he was now at the vanguard of an equally momentous struggle.\nHistory would remember the \u201cgrim page\u201d that was the Bolsonaro era, when democracy came under siege and tens of thousands of lives were needlessly lost because of the president\u2019s anti-scientific denial of Covid. \u201cBut it will also remember that there were those who defended democracy and defended life,\u201d S\u00fcssekind said.\n\u201cThis is an important, historic moment and I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll look back on it with pride.\u201d",

        "content": "Bielsa\u2019s side have not won in six Premier League games, so why have they started so poorly and are there reasons for optimism?\nRecords are there to be broken but some are more coveted than others. Should Leeds fail to beat Watford at Elland Road on Saturday it would leave them with the unwanted distinction of having failed to win any of their opening seven league fixtures for the first time. So what has gone wrong for Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s team, who swashbuckled to ninth place last season but languish in the bottom three?\nPatrick Bamford believes Leeds are suffering from a bout of \u201csecond-season syndrome\u201d, a debilitating condition afflicting a high percentage of teams a year or so after winning promotion. \u201cAs soon as you come up in the first season you have momentum, you\u2019re riding the crest of a wave, it\u2019s almost not real,\u201d the England striker told the official Leeds United podcast. \u201cYou play without expectations. There was no fear, no nerves [last season], everyone was just taking it in their stride.\u201d\nIt does not help that opponents are finally fathoming the nuances of Bielsa\u2019s high-intensity pressing game, man-for-man marking and near-constant, kaleidoscopic positional rotation. \u201cWe also had the surprise factor last season; nobody knew what we were about,\u201d said Bamford. \u201cI think this year people know what they\u2019ll get with us and they plan for that. It means we have to be bang on it all the time; we can\u2019t even make a little mistake. Crowds being back also plays a part and make away games a little tough.\u201d\nBielsa has always preferred to rely on a relatively small nucleus of senior players, with no more than two experienced options in any position. \u201cI like the amount to be sufficient rather than excessive \u2013 this is of course risky,\u201d he has acknowledged. \u201cI like to have a trimmed-down, lean squad that\u2019s not too top heavy in terms of numbers so everybody\u2019s getting regular game time.\u201d\nUntil now this policy has worked well but, for the first time in the Argentinian\u2019s tenure, Leeds have suffered a rash of injuries. The team that suffered a 2-1 home defeat by West Ham last Saturday featured only one experienced centre-half in Liam Cooper, and the average age of Bielsa\u2019s substitutes in recent weeks has been 19.\nBamford\u2019s 17 goals in 38 league games last season were integral to his team\u2019s success. This term he has scored once and is absent until after the international break with an ankle injury. His replacement, the \u00a330m Spain striker Rodrigo, is full of inventive movement but has never been prolific and is operating as more of a deep-lying false nine, with Bielsa hoping for goals from midfield. \u201cWe\u2019ve played well until the final 30 metres this season,\u201d said Bamford. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just that last pass that turns possession into a chance or converting that actual chance that we\u2019ve struggled with.\u201d Tellingly Leeds have unleashed 85 Premier League shots but only 27 have been on target, producing six goals. Meanwhile 14 have been conceded, with only Norwich\u2019s Tim Krul picking the ball out of his net more than Bielsa\u2019s outstanding France Under-21 goalkeeper, Illan Meslier, who has made more saves than any other top-tier goalkeeper this term. \u201cIllan is unbelievable,\u201d agreed Bamford. \u201cHe\u2019s bailed us out.\u201d\nLeeds are exhilarating to watch but all this glorious entertainment involves far too much tactical anarchy and kamikaze defending. A big part of the problem is that their style is so fast and furiously intense that possession is frequently conceded, prompting West Ham\u2019s manager, David Moyes, to liken the chaotically end-to-end nature of his side\u2019s win in West Yorkshire to a basketball match. Leeds still alarm, and fatigue, opponents but they are rarely in control and, apparently stuck in top gear, seem incapable of slowing down and varying the tempo. \u201cNot many teams in the world play football like them,\u201d said Moyes. Such stylistic rarity is easily explained: Bielsa\u2019s exhausting yet intricate gameplans are fiendishly tricky to execute. His side remain irrepressible in patches but struggle to sustain top form for 90 minutes.\nFew defenders relish facing Raphinha, Bielsa\u2019s Brazilian winger, England\u2019s Kalvin Phillips is eminently capable of dictating midfield in the next four, winnable matches against Watford, Southampton, Wolves and Norwich and Diego Llorente, a key centre-half, is fit again. \u201cWe knew the second season would be harder,\u201d said Bamford. \u201cBut it\u2019s still early \u2013 no one\u2019s panicking.\u201d",

Parents have disrupted meetings, refused to wear masks and threatened school board members. A school board in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, that was considering a temporary mask mandate cancelled its meeting last week after a crowd of 200 protesters surrounded the building, banged on doors and shouted at police.\nOn Wednesday, the National School Boards Association asked Joe Biden for immediate federal assistance in response to threats and violence against school board members and education officials over Covid restrictions and propaganda about critical race theory. \u201cThe classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism,\u201d the letter reads.\nThe country\u2019s more than 13,000 local school boards are facing unprecedented levels of engagement and anger over their policies, said Chip Slaven, the interim executive director of the National School Boards Association, to the Guardian last month.\n\u201cBefore this, a controversial school board meeting might be concern over hiring a superintendent, consolidating schools, or something related to the sports teams,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were the kinds of things where you might have a crowd.\u201d\nThe disruptions and hostility at recent school board meetings goes far beyond the legal expression of first amendment rights, Vernon Billy, the CSBA\u2019s executive director, wrote in the letter to the California governor.\nBilly described chaotic scenes at school board meetings across California. Protesters in San Diego county forced their way into a closed session meeting and refused to leave. In the Sacramento area, school board members fled through a back door after the \u201cmeeting was rendered unsafe\u201d due to protesters.\n\u201cToo often, when school districts contact local law enforcement authorities to restore order to these meetings or to enforce mask mandates and other safety measures, law enforcement declines,\u201d Billy wrote. \u201cIn numerous cases, law enforcement officers \u2013 in brazen defiance of the law and their professional oath \u2013 have explicitly stated they will not enforce safety mandates or restrain those whose actions willfully disrupt a meeting and prevent it from proceeding,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIt bears noting that law enforcement has not always exhibited this level of reticence when dealing with protesters who exercise their constitutional right to peaceably assemble and protest.\u201d\nBilly urged Newsom and the state attorney general to convince or command police to enforce public health and safety orders and help maintain order at school board meetings. The association is also providing training to school districts on how to manage contentious meetings and defuse conflict, said Troy Flint, a CSBA spokesperson.\nEvery corner of the state, including districts in rural and urban areas, is seeing increased hostility and deliberate attempts to shut down meetings, Flint said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something occurring with this wide of a scope all across California,\u201d he said. \u201cThe extreme partisanship that is increasingly a part of American life is rearing its head in school board discussions.\u201d",

        "content": "Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, who had Caroline Lucas\u2019s backing, aim to build on recent electoral successes\nCarla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay have been elected as the new leaders of the Greens in England and Wales, arriving with a self-stated mission to professionalise a party with an ever-growing councillor base and polling at up to 9%.\nIn a race prompted when the previous leaders, Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, decided to step down, Denyer and Ramsay beat another pairing, Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, by 6,273 votes to 3,902 after second preferences were added.\nThe only other candidate to gain more than a few hundred votes was Shahrar Ali, a former deputy leader of the party whose views on trans rights were behind Berry\u2019s decision to step down. He received 21% of first-choice votes.\nThe election was loosely billed as a choice between two approaches to the party\u2019s future. Denyer and Ramsay, both longtime activists who have served as councillors, were seen as having a more electorally focused remit, and won the sought-after endorsement of Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP.\nWomack and Omond, in contrast, are associated more with direct activism and younger members. Womack is the current deputy leader and Omond is a well-known climate activist who co-founded Extinction Rebellion.\nSpeaking after the result, Denyer and Ramsay stressed that despite their long experience in the party \u2013 Ramsay was first elected as a Green councillor nearly 20 years ago \u2013 they are only 36 and 40 respectively and by some way the youngest leaders of a mainstream national party.\nBoth stated their desire to build on recent electoral successes, with the party now having a role in running 14 councils.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to build on that, and to bring in my and Adrian\u2019s experience of winning elections, and that professionalising force,\u201d said Denyer, a Bristol councillor who is the party\u2019s parliamentary candidate in the target seat of Bristol West, one she called \u201ceminently winnable\u201d.\nRamsay, who first became a councillor in Norwich when he was 21 and is a former deputy leader of the party, said the pair\u2019s experience would stand the Greens in good stead.\n\u201cWhat we can highlight is that we both have experience of being elected as Greens and representing communities on a wide range of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking our distinctive agenda and seeing how we can apply that to people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d\nThis week Labour pledged to spend \u00a328bn a year on climate-related measures. However, Denyer said this did not mean the Greens\u2019 role was in any way diminished.\n\u201cIt is progress that the other parties are starting to talk about climate change, but we\u2019re not yet at the stage where they\u2019re acting on it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the real difference we see \u2013 in council chambers, for example. Their approach still often tends to treat climate change as an add-on, rather than being a thread that runs through all policies.\u201d\nRamsay said the party would also campaign vigorously on economic policies such as a four-day week and universal basic income, saying their approach was \u201cjust as much about social justice as it is about tacking the climate and ecological emergency\u201d.\nWhile the party usually elects or re-elects leaders every two years, this race came just a year after the previous one. Berry had served three years as co-leader and Bartley five, initially as co-leader alongside Lucas.\nBerry announced she was stepping down after Ali, whose views she considered transphobic, was promoted to the frontbench against her wishes, a factor of the limited power wielded by Green leaders.\nAli then decided to stand for leader, saying the party should become a beacon to \u201cpolitically homeless\u201d women put off by the tone of the trans rights debate.\nThe other candidates in the race were Martin Hemingway and Tina Rothery, who stood as a pair and received 342 first-choice votes, and Ashley Gunstock, who won 212.",

They were developed as a response to the events of the last international window when Premier League clubs were at the centre of international rows regarding quarantine.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have worked closely with football authorities to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of both club and country while maintaining the highest levels of public health and safety.\n\u201cOur best defence against the virus is vaccination and these new measures will allow fully vaccinated players to fulfil their international duties in the safest, most practical way possible, while allowing them to train and play with their clubs as early as possible upon their return.\u201d\nPlayers who travel must sign a code of conduct which includes restrictions on transport and close contact and protocols on testing, vaccination and bubbles. Those who are fully vaccinated are not obliged to stay in the hotels used by members of the public for quarantining after entering from a red zone country but other players must abide by the usual rules.\nIn the last international window some clubs such as Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea simply refused to release their South American players, a decision met by Fifa with the threat of a five-day ban from competing in domestic matches. That threat was never carried out, with national FAs choosing not to implement the sanction, one diplomatic gesture thought to have been made in the hope of enabling the kind of changes to quarantine that have now been agreed.\nCertainly there will be hopes that some of the events of the last international window can be avoided, such as when the World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina was brought to a premature end after Brazilian health officials stormed the pitch claiming that Argentina players had failed to confess their presence in the UK over the preceding weeks.\nThe last window ended with the leaders of Fifa, the Football Association and the Premier League sending a letter to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, seeking to resolve the issue.",

But the law has clearly emerged as a cudgel to be used against disloyal media and other local critics who have little, if any, connection to a foreign government.\nThe new FSB list would send a chilling message to Russian journalists and thinktankers who focus on the military and regularly publish reports about planning, procurements, weapons development, and other aspects of Russia\u2019s defence policy. It would also threaten a similar label for ordinary Russians who publish personal accounts or photographs that show vast troop movements, as happened ahead of Russia\u2019s military buildup on the Ukrainian border this spring.\nNone of the information is believed to contain government secrets but its receipt by a foreign government or organisation, possibly by posting it on the internet, could be considered grounds for a \u201cforeign agent\u201d label.

Outfits inspired by Kim Kardashian\u2019s at the Met Gala, the QAnon \u2018shaman\u2019 and Christina Aguilera are in demand\nThe year 2020 was an odd one for playing dress-up. Still in the throes of the pandemic and under the shadow of the last US presidency, the bestselling fancy-dress costumes last Halloween included outfits that referenced \u201cfake news\u201d and the Netflix show Tiger King. \u201cLast year was a huge Halloween and caught all of us by surprise,\u201d says Alicia Thompson, director of brand marketing at Yandy, the US costume-maker. \u201cClearly, everyone was looking for a mental escape from the overwhelming circumstances of the year.\u201d\nThis year, alongside perennial favourites such as cheerleaders, cowgirls, Austin Powers and Scooby Doo, viral moments have provided inspiration. A costume that approximates to Kim Kardashian\u2019s all-black fetish-istic Balenciaga outfit at the Met Gala is selling out. \u201cThe Mystery Gala Guest costume is flying off the shelves,\u201d Thompson says. \u201c[It] was just begging to be created, right? How could we not? There is no shortage of ways that fans and detractors alike can have some real fun with this one.\u201d\nAt the other end of the \u201cfun\u201d spectrum is the King of the Jungle, which seems to visually reference the so-called QAnon shaman Jacob Chansley\u2019s horned outfit at the Washington Capitol Riot. Yikes! Thompson denies the visual connection. \u201cThe costume is selling well, for sure, but I couldn\u2019t speak to whether people are using it for that purpose,\u201d she says \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t the intention of carrying that item.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the 00s nostalgia train is running at full force, with a look which recalls Christina Aguilera\u2019s Dirrty video from 2002 (flared leather chaps and all) selling well. \u201cThe trend has been steadily influencing fashion this year, made its way into lingerie and staked a claim on Halloween 2021 with a vengeance,\u201d says Thompson.\nAlso interesting is the costumes that have fallen out of favour. Although \u201cessential worker\u201d costumes and a look mimicking a bottle of hand sanitiser remain bestsellers, pandemic-specific costumes have been sidestepped. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see sexy Covid-19 costumes,\u201d Thompson says. A certain presidential era is not being celebrated, either. \u201cThe Trump-specific costumes aren\u2019t popular any more at all,\u201d she says, with reference to Yandy\u2019s Donna T Rumpshaker costume, a big seller during the Trump era. \u201cWe had to discount the remaining inventory.\u201d\nWhile its Fake News dress is still being bought, political costumes are generally out of favour this year. \u201cThe political spectrum has been so polarising that it doesn\u2019t offer the same humour it used to.\u201d\nThompson says Halloween provides psychological insight into a person\u2019s character. \u201cYou can learn a lot about people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time of year where people explore dark desires and dark humour. While not all of it is in good taste, there is always going to be a set of people who use Halloween to tap into themes that feel off limits any other time of year.\u201d",

        "content": "Democrats say holdup is temporary despite stalemate over Biden\u2019s sweeping economic agenda\nThe US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, postponed a planned vote on a trillion-dollar infrastructure package on Thursday night a stinging defeat after progressives threatened to revolt and Democratic leaders failed to reach an agreement with centrists holdouts on the full sweep of Joe Biden\u2019s ambitious economic vision.\nThe decision to delay the vote capped a frantic day of negotiations in Washington that stretched late into the evening, as the president and Democratic leaders attempted to break a stalemate between a handful of moderates, who pushed for the infrastructure vote, and progressives who believe it would be insufficient without a broader, $3.5tn social policy package. At the same time, negotiations between White House officials and two Senate Democrats opposed to the current size of Biden\u2019s social spending package dragged into the night without a deal.\n\u201cA great deal of progress has been made this week, and we are closer to an agreement than ever,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, after the House announced there would not be a vote on Thursday. \u201cBut we are not there yet, and so we will need some additional time to finish the work, starting tomorrow morning first thing.\u201d\nDemocrats insisted that the setback was temporary, but the delay underscored the fragile state of the negotiations as a pair of Senate holdouts demanded the president dramatically shrink the more expansive legislation containing many of the party\u2019s top policy priorities. The House was slated to reconvene on Friday, giving Democrats at least another day to attempt to reach an agreement that would satisfy the feuding factions.\n\u201cThere will be a vote today,\u201d Pelosi told reporters as she departed the Capitol shortly after midnight.\nBoth pieces are critical to Biden\u2019s economic vision. He spent weeks personally courting Republican senators to secure a bipartisan victory on the infrastructure bill, which would invest $1tn in upgrading roads, bridges and broadband. But he has staked his presidency \u2013 and his legacy \u2013 on the passage of the mammoth social policy bill that would expand healthcare, make childcare more affordable, establish paid federal leave and combat the climate crisis, paid for by tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations.\nIn a vaguely worded letter to colleagues on Thursday night, Pelosi called it a \u201cday of progress\u201d.\n\u201cDiscussions continue with the House, Senate and White House to reach a bicameral framework agreement to Build Back Better through a reconciliation bill,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cAll of this momentum brings us closer to shaping the reconciliation bill in a manner that will pass the House and Senate,\u201d she said, concluding the letter with the promise: \u201cMore to follow.\u201d\nThe delayed vote was a significant blow for Pelosi, a self-described master negotiator who insisted earlier that Democrats were \u201con the path to win\u201d the infrastructure vote. \u201cThis is the fun part,\u201d she boasted to reporters on Thursday, referring to the final, chaotic stretch before securing a major legislative achievement.\nYet with only three votes to spare, and Republicans largely opposed, Pelosi was unable to untangle the competing promises made to progressives and centrists in time to vote on Thursday.\nIn an effort to placate a small band of centrist Democrats, Pelosi promised to bring the infrastructure bill to the House floor for a vote this week. But progressives had long maintained that they would only support that bill if it passed in tandem with the far more expansive $3.5tn package.\nWhen it became clear on Thursday that the Senate was not prepared to pass the legislation as written, progressives stood by their threat to tank the infrastructure bill, which they saw as leverage for ensuring Biden\u2019s entire economic vision was enacted.\nThe fate of Biden\u2019s agenda remains in limbo, and with Democrats deeply at odds, it was unclear on Thursday night how they planned to progress.\nThe terms of the negotiations were largely driven by two Democratic holdouts in the Senate, who are opposed to the current size of the spending package. On Thursday, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he would not support a spending package that exceeded $1.5tn, less than half of the size of the proposal being pushed by Biden and most of the Democratic party.\nAmid the negotiations and with only hours to spare, Congress passed legislation to avert a government shutdown at midnight on Thursday, with Biden later signing a measure that would fund the federal government through 3 December.\nThe measure was passed by the House and Senate with bipartisan support, though a significant number of Republicans voted against it.",

Over the same 25-year period, black Britons made up 3.1% of shortlisted nominees.\nThe percentage of black and minority ethnic (BAME) authors increased from 4.65% in 1996 to 34.25% in 2020.\nBetween 1996 and 2020, there were 1,357 entries, of which 82 were black authors (7.1%). In the years 1996, 2001, 2002 and 2009 there were no black authors shortlisted across any of the prizes. The 2009 shortlists did not include the Dylan Thomas Prize and the Folio Prize.\nThe analysis demonstrates that disparities remain between prizes, with some awards announcing more diverse shortlists than others.\nThe most diverse prize in terms of black entries was the Dylan Thomas Prize, the leading prize for young writers, with black authors representing 15.28% of the shortlist. The prize was also the most diverse for BAME authors, making up 29.17% of shortlisted entries.\nThe least diverse prize for BAME entries was the Carnegie medal, where just 6% of those shortlisted were BAME authors.\nThe Carnegie medal, the UK\u2019s oldest children\u2019s book award, was criticised for its lack of diversity in 2018.\nBetween 1996 and 2017, Malorie Blackman was the only black author shortlisted for the prize out of 150 authors. Between 2018 and 2021, having made an effort to increase racial diversity, black authors made up 37.5% of shortlisted nominees.\nIn 2015, the novelists Sunny Singh and Nikesh Shukla launched the Jhalak prize, to be awarded annually to a writer of colour with the book of the year, after backlash against the lack of diversity in prize nominations.\nSingh advised people to be cautious about the findings. She called for a breakdown on how many of the shortlisted BAME authors were British or longstanding residents, and for further analysis on how many went on to win the award.\nShe said: \u201cThe Carnegie medal to this day, 84 years down the line, has still not managed to be awarded to a black British writer or a British writer of colour. What\u2019s going on?\n\u201cI think the problem is that as long as the publishing industry and the literary establishment sees inclusion as a problem, sees equity as a problem, on whichever axis, not just race, gender, sexuality, class, and disability \u2026 we will not move past the superficial thing of a kind of tokenism where it\u2019s the boxes are ticked, and then they can move on.\u201d\nShe added, however, that the past year had felt like a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for tackling racial inequalities in the industry. \u201cIt just feels like there\u2019s a lot more of us speaking up and speaking out, just pushing in the same direction and doing so publicly than they were even five years ago.\u201d\nAfter the protests in June 2020, Bernardine Evaristo and Reni Eddo-Lodge became the first black British women to top the UK\u2019s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts. The then newly formed Black Writers\u2019 Guild (BWG) wrote an open letter airing concerns that British publishers were \u201craising awareness of racial inequality without significantly addressing their own\u201d.\nIn that same year, the Booker prize announced its most racially diverse shortlist to date. Evaristo became the first black British writer to win the award, which she shared with Margaret Atwood.\nThe Guardian researched every individual listed, looking at pictures and references of how each author identifies. In cases where a person\u2019s ethnicity was unclear, further checks were carried out to determine how the author said they identified, which may include speaking to the author in question.\nThe overall proportion of black authors \u2013 6.2% \u2013 is based on the number of nominees meaning the same author could be counted more than once. The equivalent figure for the number of individual black authors is 6.5%.\nBetween 1996 and 2020, some of the individual years within this period did not feature every prize listed, as some did not run in certain years.\nBooks that were double-authored were counted as one author, as none of the books that featured double authorship had authors from different ethnicities.\nAuthored by Gaverne Bennett and created with the British Library, this literary timeline explores the history of Black writing and literature in Britain through around 50 texts.

An earlier version said no black authors were shortlisted \u201cbetween 1996 and 2009\u201d; as the article made clear, this was the case in four of the years during that period.",

        "content": "Greater financial instability, fraud and funding of terrorism likely unless governments toughen supervision, fund says\nTougher regulation is needed to prevent the rapid growth in cryptocurrencies leading to financial instability, defrauding of consumers and the funding of terrorism, the International Monetary Fund has said.\nThe Washington-based IMF said the 10-fold increase in the market value of crypto assets \u2013 digital or virtual currencies \u2013 to more than $2tn since early 2020 required more active and collaborative supervision by governments.\nIn a chapter from its forthcoming Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said many of the new cryptocurrencies lacked robust governance and risk practices.\nCryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the \u2018money\u2019 to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs \u2013 and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous.\nIf you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain.\nBitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, sometimes surging in value as investors have piled in \u2013 and recently crashing back down.\nSceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists, while libertarian monetarists enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank.\nThe whole concept of cryptocurrencies has been criticised for its ecological impact, with \"mining\" for new coins requiring\u00a0vast energy reserves and the associated carbon footprint\u00a0of the whole system.\nRichard Partington and Martin Belam\nDimitris Drakopoulos, Fabio Natalucci and Evan Papageorgiou, authors of the chapter, said in a blog that crypto exchanges had faced significant disruptions during periods of market turbulence. \u201cThere are also several high-profile cases of hacking-related thefts of customer funds. So far, these incidents have not had a significant impact on financial stability. However, as crypto assets become more mainstream, their importance in terms of potential implications for the wider economy is set to increase,\u201d they said.\nThe blog noted the substantial risks to consumers from inadequate disclosure and oversight, given that some currencies were \u201clikely created solely for speculation purposes or even outright fraud. The (pseudo) anonymity of crypto assets also creates data gaps for regulators and can open unwanted doors for money laundering, as well as terrorist financing.\u201d\nThe IMF also highlighted potential problems with the four-fold increase in the supply of stablecoins \u2013 cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their value, usually against the US dollar \u2013 to $120bn (\u00a388bn) during 2021.\nThe blog said: \u201cGiven the composition of their reserves, some stablecoins could be subject to runs, with knock-on effects to the financial system. The runs could be driven by investor concerns about the quality of their reserves or the speed at which reserves can be liquidated to meet potential redemptions.\u201d\nLast month, China made transactions in cryptocurrencies illegal, but the IMF said emerging and developing countries appeared to be leading the way with their use. This risked damaging the ability of central banks to effectively implement monetary policy and potentially created financial stability risks, it added.\n\u201cAs a first step, regulators and supervisors need to be able to monitor rapid developments in the crypto ecosystem and the risks they create by swiftly tackling data gaps. The global nature of crypto assets means that policymakers should enhance cross-border coordination to minimise the risks of regulatory arbitrage and ensure effective supervision and enforcement,\u201d the IMF said.",

Would he please consider getting behind the wheel again?\nThat is exactly what Crowther wants to do but can\u2019t because his application to get his licence back after a medical emergency is snarled up in a backlog at the DVLA \u2013 the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency \u2013 in Swansea, south Wales.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent so many hours trying to get through to the DVLA and the transport department to sort my licence out,\u201d said Crowther, 61, from Plymouth. \u201cI want to do my bit and help out. Yes, the money comes in useful but it\u2019s not just about that. I like to feel I\u2019m helping by getting stuff moving around the country.\u201d\nAs the scale of the crisis at the DVLA emerged this week, a row has broken out over who is to blame. Workers and their union representatives claim mismanagement during the Covid pandemic at the DVLA has led to the problems. The government and the DVLA blame staff who have been on strike over their working conditions.\nIt could get worse. Covid cases continue to blight the DVLA, an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT), and more industrial action may be on the way this autumn and winter.\nCrowther is one of the many twiddling their thumbs when they are desperate to be at work. He suffered a series of cardiac arrests in May but had a pacemaker fitted and five weeks later his doctors said he was fit to drive again.\nHe set about trying to get his licence back and informed the DVLA. A letter eventually came back saying that the agency\u2019s doctor was considering his case. And then nothing more.\nThis week the DfT admitted in response to a parliamentary question that there were 56,144 applications for vocational driving licences \u2013 for lorry and bus drivers \u2013 awaiting processing. It said of these, about 4,000 were for provisional licences, while the \u201cvast majority\u201d were for renewals. In most cases, drivers could continue to drive while the application was being processed.\nThe DVLA said provisional licences were being issued in about five days but conceded that \u201cmore complex transactions\u201d, for example if medical investigations were needed, may face \u201clonger delays.\u201d\nDVLA and government sources suggested the problem was, at least in part, down to strikes by members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS). The PCS said the government had scuppered a deal it had agreed with DVLA managers, which would have halted the industrial action \u2013 so the backlog was down to ministers.\nThe problems at the DVLA were laid bare at meetings of the transport committee in Westminster in January and July.\nUnion officials told committee members that when Covid first struck, staff were sent home but did not have the technology to do their jobs \u2013 and they were not trusted by their managers to work remotely.\nThen, the union says, workers were ordered back in too quickly to try to clear the backlog, before their offices were Covid-safe.\nIt resulted in \u201cthe single biggest Covid outbreak of any workplace in the UK\u201d, according to the union\u2019s general secretary, Mark Serwotka. By that point there had been 643 Covid cases and one death.\nSarah Evans, a union official at the DVLA, told the committee that \u201cmassive safety concerns\u201d remained. She claimed too many people were sharing too many facilities, such as lifts, kitchens and toilets.\nThere have been a series of strikes over conditions during the summer but the PCS says the DVLA is no further forward in prioritising staff safety and no better prepared for waves of the virus over the winter and autumn. Covid cases continue to rise, with the union claiming there were a further 152 cases in September and that the running total is now at 874.\nThe DVLA insists conditions are safe and that it is not possible for staff processing vocational licences to work from home as they have to help deal with the 60,000 items of mail it receives every day.",

Open-source databases aggregate information from news reports and public record requests, capturing a wider range of fatal police-involved incidents.\n\u201cOpen-sourced data is a more reliable and comprehensive resource to help inform policies that can prevent police violence and save lives,\u201d said Sharara.\nIn total, the NVSS database misclassified nearly 60% of all fatal police encounters involving Black Americans. NVSS also missed approximately 50% of all police-involved deaths of Hispanic people, 56% of all police-involved deaths of non-Hispanic white people, and 33% of deaths involving non-Hispanic people across other races.\n\u201cInaccurately reporting or misclassifying these deaths further obscures the larger issue of systemic racism that is embedded in many US institutions, including law enforcement,\u201d Sharara said.\nThe paper found that men die from police violence at higher rates than women, with 30,600 police-involved deaths recorded among men and 1,420 among women between 1980 and 2019.\nResearchers also noted the large conflict of interests inherent in tracking police-involved deaths. Coroners are often embedded within police departments and can be disincentivized from determining that deaths are caused by police violence.\n\u201cThe same government responsible for this violence is also responsible for reporting on it,\u201d said Sharara.\nPast studies have analyzed underreporting of fatal police incidents and how Black Americans disproportionately die from police violence, but previous research was conducted over much shorter time periods.\nThe new study published by Lancet is the longest study period to date, though researchers acknowledged that future studies are needed to fully examine the impact of police violence in the US as data collected did not include police officers killed by civilians, police violence in US territories or abroad, and used death certificates that could not identify non-cisgender people, notably masking police violence against trans people.\nOverall, an increased use of open-source data collection is needed to document and understand disparities in police brutality by race, ethnicity, and gender, the researchers said, allowing for more targeted changes to policing and public safety protocols. The authors also acknowledged that more needs to be done to combat police-involved violence.\n\u201cAs a community we need to do more. Efforts to prevent police violence and address systemic racism in the USA, including body cameras that record interactions of police with civilians along with de-escalation training and implicit bias training for police officers, for example, have largely been ineffective,\u201d said co-lead author Eve Wool.",

I have full confidence in the UN staff who are in Ethiopia doing this work.\u201d\nThe news followed warnings from UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths this week that Ethiopia\u2019s de facto blockade of aid has imposed famine on hundreds of thousands of people in the country\u2019s northern Tigray region, which has been racked by conflict for nearly a year.\nHe told Reuters there was an escalating crisis inside the region of 6 million people, with children dying of hunger and medicine stocks running out. Child malnutrition is at its highest rate since the Somalia famine of 2010-12, which killed up to 260,000 people.\nThere has been increasing international criticism of Ethiopia\u2019s handling of aid, with the US government threatening sanctions on the fighting parties.\nEthiopia\u2019s government has stopped food, medicine and fuel deliveries entering Tigray for nearly three months, in a bid to block support for the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which has been fighting its troops since the federal army launched a bloody offensive last November. Thousands of people have died in the conflict.\nWith swarms of desert locusts ravaging crops in Ethiopia, and potentially poor harvests on the way, problems are mounting on what is already the world\u2019s worst hunger crisis in a decade, warned Griffiths.\nAccording to UN humanitarian services, 5.2 million people need help in Ethiopia\u2019s northern regions of Tigray, Amhara and Afar. Aid delivery including fuel into Tigray remains challenging.\nThe US strongly condemned the expulsion and called on the Ethiopian government to reverse the decision. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement that Ethiopia must now free the flow of aid to citizens, or face a wave of sanctions.\n\u201cThe expulsion is counterproductive to international efforts to keep civilians safe, and deliver lifesaving humanitarian assistance to the millions in dire need,\u201d Blinken said.\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to use this authority or other tools to respond to those who obstruct humanitarian assistance to the people of Ethiopia.\n\u201cWe call on the international community similarly to employ all appropriate tools to apply pressure on the government of Ethiopia and any other actors impeding humanitarian access.\u201d",

And it is growing by around 12,000 a week. This is happening on pig farms all over the country; they are backed up and running out of space to keep animals.\u201d\nOne farmer said they were being told to expect further reductions next week in the number of animals able to be transported, as there were not enough workers at meat-processing plants to handle the loads.\n\u201cThe problem in the industry has got considerably worse over the last three weeks,\u201d said Mutimer. \u201c[A cull] involves either shooting them on the farm or taking them to an abattoir and disposing of them in a skip. These animals won\u2019t go into the food chain, they will either be rendered or sent for incineration. It is an absolute travesty.\u201d\nHe said that a combination of post-Brexit immigration rules and an exodus of foreign workers amid constantly shifting pandemic restrictions on travel had left the industry at crisis point.\nThe NPA urged retailers not to turn to cheaper pork from European Union suppliers to stave off a shortage on the shelves.\nMutimer said farmers were keeping stock on their farms for longer even though they were over their ideal weight for slaughter \u2013 he gave the example that on his farm some pigs are now 25kg (55lb) over prime \u2013 but farmers were out of space and there was a welfare issue.\n\u201cPens and sheds are not designed for animals of this size,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are heading for an acute welfare disaster quickly.\u201d\nEarlier this month, meat industry representatives warned that farmers might have to begin culling pigs because of a looming shortage of carbon dioxide to stun the backlog of animals destined for abattoirs.\nMost food-grade CO2 in the UK is produced as a byproduct from fertiliser factories, but rocketing gas wholesale prices had forced the closure of two of the biggest plants, until the government stepped in with financial support to restart production.\nOn Friday, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, temporarily exempted parts of the CO2 industry from competition law, to help them to share information and prioritise supplies to businesses that need it most.\nThe meat industry is just one of many sectors of the economy struggling with labour shortages linked to Brexit and the pandemic, with a shortage of delivery workers hitting supply chains.\nAfter reports of a lack of HGV drivers to deliver fuel to forecourts, motorists rushed to fill up their tanks, prompting more than a week of fuel shortages across the country.\nThe crime and policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said on Friday that motorists could face another \u201cweek or so\u201d of long queues at filling stations, although he added that the \u201csituation is stabilising\u201d.\nSupply disruptions are making it harder for UK factories to operate, with an \u201congoing onslaught of snags and hitches at every stage of the supply chain,\u201d said Duncan Brock, director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply.\nKwarteng, in an interview with the website Conservative Home published on Friday, said the labour and supply chain shortages were part of a transition to a new post-Brexit economy that no longer relied on a \u201clow-wage, high-immigration\u201d model.\nThe labour shortage is also hitting the hospitality sector, with JD Wetherspoon, which runs 861 pubs across the country, reporting on Friday that it was struggling to find staff in some areas.\nMeanwhile, the Bolton-headquartered retailer AO.com had more than \u00a3200m wiped off its stock market value after it blamed driver shortages and supply chain problems for a slowing in growth and lower-than-expected profits.",

This includes accepting packets of US bank notes and gold bars in bribes from Yangon\u2019s former chief minister, Phyo Min Thein; renting government land at a discount; and using funds of the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation, a charity founded by Aung San Suu Kyi in the name of her mother, to build a home.\nThe anti-corruption law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, more than any other case facing the former leader. She is also accused of breaching the official secrets act, which it is believed could lead to 14 years in prison.\nAnalysts and human rights groups have condemned the allegations as a politically motivated attempt to discredit her, while the UN has reiterated calls for her immediate release.\nIn court on Friday, Phyo Min Thein, who has previously appeared on military TV claiming he gave bribes to Aung San Suu Kyi on multiple occassions, was among those who testified. \u201cHe seemed to be depressed and didn\u2019t look at Daw Aung San Suu Kyi even when he walked in front of her,\u201d said her defence lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw.\nThe exact value of the alleged bribes described in court is not known. However, state media has previously accused her of accepting $600,000 (\u00a3445,000) in cash and 11.4kg of gold.\nAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s legal team asked the judge to postpone the case, saying they had not received instructions from their client. She had only received police papers on Friday morning, Khin Maung Zaw said.\nThe judge said he would adjourn the cross-examination by the defence lawyers but the examination of the witness would continue.\nAung San Suu Kyi, 76, has had very limited opportunities to meet with her lawyers to prepare for the legal charges filed against her, which could lead to her spending decades in prison. She has been held in detention since 1 February, when the military seized power in a coup, prompting defiant protests by the public, which the military has attempted to suppress with brutal violence. Myanmar has since been gripped by worsening conflict, the collapse of health services and an economic crisis. The country\u2019s currency, the kyat, has lost more than 60% of its value since the start of September, causing food and fuel price rises.\nOn Thursday, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in a report to the general assembly that a coordinated international approach was needed to respond to \u201cgrave humanitarian implications, including rapidly deteriorating food security, an increase in mass displacements and a weakened public health system compounded by a new wave of Covid-19 infections\u201d.\nHe also reiterated calls for the release of all people arbitrarily detained. More than 8,000 have been arrested since the coup, and more than 1,100 people killed, according to UN estimates. At least 120 have reportedly died in custody\nAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s corruption case will resume next Friday in Naypyidaw, while a fifth case under the anti-corruption law is also expected to be heard by the Yangon region high court.\n Court hearings involving several other cases against her are ongoing. This includes charges that she breached a natural disaster law by breaking coronavirus restrictions during campaigning for last year\u2019s election, and that she broke a communications law and an import law by illegally possessing walkie-talkies.\nPhil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said there were serious procedural concerns regarding the cases. \u201cMyanmar\u2019s military junta seems determined to rush forward with the prosecution of Aung San Suu Kyi despite ongoing failures to provide her with adequate access to her counsel,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the junta sees her as their primary political threat and wants to put her behind bars as quickly as possible for as long as possible,\u201d said Robertson.\nAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in last year\u2019s election but the military refused to accept the result. It alleged widespread fraud, with no evidence. Such claims have been dismissed by observers, including the independent group Asian Network for Free Elections.\n  Despite international condemnation and efforts by neighbouring countries to negotiate, the military has shown no willingness to compromise. It had previously promised to hold elections within 12 months of the coup, but the army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, has since extended this timeline to August 2023.",

For those thousands and thousands of police officers out there who will have to work harder \u2013 much harder \u2013 to win public trust, it is a very, very difficult time.\u201d\nThe Met announced on Thursday night that it would no longer deploy plainclothes officers on their own, after the sentencing hearing was told that Couzens used lockdown rules to falsely arrest Everard during the abduction.\nThe force encouraged members of the public to challenge lone plainclothes police officers if they are ever approached, asking where the officer\u2019s colleagues are, where they have come from, why they are there and exactly why they are stopping or talking to them.\nIt also suggests verifying the police officer\u2019s identity by asking to hear their radio operator or asking to speak to the radio operator themselves.\nIf a person still does not feel safe, the force said they should consider \u201cshouting out to a passerby, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down or, if you are in the position to do so, calling 999.\u201d\nThe Met said: \u201cAll officers will, of course, know about this case and will be expecting in an interaction like that \u2013 rare as it may be \u2013 that members of the public may be understandably concerned and more distrusting than they previously would have been, and should and will expect to be asked more questions.\u201d\nHowever the Met and government ministers were accused of having a tone-deaf response for suggesting women should flag down a bus.\nPatsy Stevenson, who was arrested at a vigil for Everard in the days after her murder, said the advice was \u201calmost laughable if it wasn\u2019t so disgusting\u201d.\nShe told the PA Media news agency: \u201cI feel like they are just clutching at straws, because the advice isn\u2019t relevant. It\u2019s like a distraction because, number one, in that situation you can\u2019t just stop and hail down a bus or a taxi or something.\n\u201cCan you imagine the distrust that people have right now where they have to protect themselves from the police in that manner? That is shocking.\u201d\nThe Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy tweeted: \u201cWe want to know what the Met are doing to address the deeply rooted problems with violence against women within the force. This completely derisory advice shows they\u2019re still not taking it seriously. And they wonder why trust is at an all-time low?\u201d\nRuth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, tweeted: \u201cThis is so grim. If someone believe they are in \u2018real and imminent danger\u2019 - from a police officer they\u2019ve to flag down a bus or start chapping doors. Horrendous.\u201d\nPressure is mounting on the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, to resign over the case, which has sparked a national outcry over the safety of women on Britain\u2019s streets.\nThe Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman and the Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse are among those calling for Dick to step down.\nMalthouse backed the commissioner on Friday, adding that she had one of the \u201cmost difficult jobs in the country\u201d.\n\u201cWhat I want in a policing leader is when awful calamities like this happen \u2026 I want a police leader who is transparent, willing to learn, willing to change and has a conviction and a commitment not to be defensive about the failings of the organisation, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in Cressida Dick,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe is a dedicated and talented and committed police officer who is driving the Metropolitan police to ever greater standards of care and improvement and fighting crime.\u201d\nJess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said trust in police was \u201cnot going to be built back overnight\u201d.\nShe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is going to be built up if we see the government and police forces starting to actually take violence against women and girls, and the complaints that women make day in, day out, seriously.\u201d\nShe said she wanted to see violence against women and girls prioritised in every police force across the UK and in the Whitehall offices of the Home Office, adding that it should be given the same resources as other crime types such as terrorism and county lines gangs.\n\u201cI want finally to not have to keep asking that this should be a priority,\u201d she said. \u201cThe seriousness of this crime should never be underestimated.\u201d",

There was outrage on Friday at advice published on the Metropolitan police\u2019s website that fearful women could flag down a bus, while a pilot to put plainclothes police officers in bars to protect women announced was derided by campaigners as \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cperformative\u201d.\nThe government has also announced a \u00a325m Safer Streets Fund for measures such as better street lighting and CCTV, and last month launched StreetSafe, to allow people to report areas where they feel unsafe. Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said this \u201cfelt like the wrong response in the wrong tone\u201d adding that it \u201ccompletely ignored all the structural issues around men\u2019s violence towards women\u201d.\nThe government has promised a national communications campaign to tackle violence against women and girls, but details remain vague. Simon called for it to \u201cbe done big with a well-funded multi-year\u201d approach.\nOn Thursday the Met said 650 new officers would be deployed into busy public places, \u201cincluding those where women and girls often lack confidence that they are safe\u201d. It also pledged to publish a new strategy for tackling violence against women and girls \u2013 but critics have asked why should a strategy is not already in place.\nThe national police lead for rape, Sarah Crew, previously told the Guardian many specialist teams across England and Wales had disbanded during austerity and called for them to be reinstated.\nIn June the government published its long-awaited Rape Review, along with an apology, and promised \u00a33.2m for a police pilot focusing investigations on suspects rather than complainants\u2019 credibility, a return to pre-2016 prosecution levels after years of record decline, bi-annual \u201cscorecards\u201d measuring key indicators. Victims were promised they would no longer be subject to a \u201cdigital strip searches\u201d, get better communication and access to therapy.\nCampaigners welcomed the apology, but said the measures lacked urgency and were underfunded.\nIn its Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) strategy unveiled in July, the government promised to consider criminalising public street harassment and banning the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in cases of sexual harassment and abuse in higher education. It announced a new national police chief with overall responsibility for VAWG and promised a review into offender management. Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence, said there was much to welcome in the strategy, but added: \u201cSaying it on a document doesn\u2019t make it so.\u201d\nMP Stella Creasy has spearheaded efforts to have misogyny dealt with as a hate crime. In March, following the news of Everard\u2019s murder, the government said it would require police forces to collect data on crimes apparently motivated by hostility towards women on an \u201cexperimental basis\u201d from this autumn, seen as a step towards the criminalisation of misogyny. Some campaigners have expressed doubts about the push, expressing concerns it could be unenforceable; others said it brought useful scrutiny.",

        "content": "Exclusive: ministers also looking at giving Ofsted more powers and accelerating academisation\nRadical proposals to bring back national testing for 14-year-olds and scrap limits on teaching hours are under consideration by ministers, the Guardian has learned.\nPlans have also been drawn up to hand more powers to Ofsted and to beef up inspections of schools in England, before an education white paper next year.\nOne of the most controversial proposals sitting in the in-tray of the new education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, is to reintroduce externally marked standard assessment tests (Sats) at the end of key stage 3, when most pupils are 14.\nThe tests were abolished by Labour in 2008 after a series of inquiries concluded that they fuelled a \u201cpervasive anxiety\u201d in younger pupils\u2019 lives and distorted children\u2019s education. Sats currently take place at ages seven and 11, in English, maths and sometimes science.\nSources said ministers were worried that key stage 3, which covers the first three years of secondary school, had \u201cgot a bit lost\u201d because there is no assessment at the end of it, and children can end up losing focus. Some schools have started teaching GCSE courses a year early, in year 9.\nIn another move that is likely to infuriate teaching unions, the Department for Education (DfE) has been exploring getting rid of the national cap on the number of hours teachers have to be available for work. This would allow school leaders to negotiate locally with staff to extend their school day \u2013 a much-debated option amid planning for post-pandemic catchup.\nThere are also plans to give the school inspectorate, Ofsted, greater powers, in line with commitments in the Conservatives\u2019 2019 election manifesto. The party pledged an extra \u00a310m to extend individual school inspections from two to three days, pilot no-notice inspections and train more inspectors.\nMinisters are looking at ways to accelerate the academisation programme, to turn schools still maintained by local authorities into academies, though there remain concerns about the capacity of existing trusts to take on more schools and the number of academies that are failing.\nSources told the Guardian the proposals were being discussed in the weeks leading up to the sacking of Gavin Williamson as education secretary last month, in preparation for a white paper outlining changes early next year. Key figures in the sector, including several academy trust leaders, are understood to have been called in and sounded out.\nOne academy trust leader declined to take part after hearing of the proposals, saying the DfE and headteachers should prioritise helping pupils catch up on learning lost during the pandemic.\nA DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on speculation. The government is committed to an ambitious, long-term education recovery plan and an excellent education system that works for all.\u201d\nConcern has been growing about funding for schools in the forthcoming spending review. This week the Times reported that education would be hard hit and the DfE did not submit a formal application for catchup funding. \u201cThe department has its eye on other things,\u201d a source told the Guardian. However, insiders in the DfE have disputed the claim.\nThe white paper proposals signal a new appetite on the part of ministers to pick a fight with teaching unions after a fraught 18 months during the pandemic. \u201cThere was a view that when Michael Gove was perceived to be successful [as education secretary], he was championing parents and being muscular with the profession,\u201d said one insider by way of explanation.\nAny attempt to dismantle the 1,265-hour \u201cdirected time\u201d cap for teachers will be resisted by unions, for whom workload remains a huge concern. Most state schools in England operate in line with the school teachers\u2019 pay and conditions document, which says a classroom teacher can be directed by a head to work up to a maximum of 1,265 hours over 195 days of the year, though in practice they work far more.\nWith concerns growing about the impact of the pandemic on disadvantaged children\u2019s learning, the DfE has been looking at how to reform school hours to give pupils more class time to help them catch up after months of disruption to their studies.\n\u201cIf the 1,265 hours agreement goes, it would allow headteachers to determine locally what the working arrangements in the school were. It could make longer days cheaper, because you wouldn\u2019t have to pay teachers to do it,\u201d a source said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of misunderstanding about how fatigued, tired and frustrated the profession is. They\u2019ve really gone the extra mile. Anything that pushed them like this, you could see a backlash.\u201d\nOf the proposed testing reforms, one trust leader said: \u201cI can see the logic. I\u2019m in favour of testing. But we need to rethink the system a bit more radically. It\u2019s become one of those tests of strength: \u2018Our teachers must work more hours. We have a right to know more. We want to see what we are getting for our money.\u2019\u201d\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cIf these proposals were in a white paper, that would be a backward step. The pandemic has shown that schools can be and are trusted. Further unnecessary high-stakes accountability measures will do nothing to help the recovery mission. What schools are crying out for is support, not sanction.\u201d\nThe proposals are understood to be at an early stage and will now be considered by Zahawi.\n This article was amended on 4 October 2021. The school teachers\u2019 pay and conditions document defines a full working year as 195 days, not 190 as a previous version said.",

        "content": "Justice department attorney argues state \u2018resorted to vigilante justice\u2019 at hearing on Friday to consider whether legislation is unconstitutional\nA federal judge considered whether to block Texas\u2019s six-week abortion ban on Friday, the most restrictive anti-abortion law in force in the US, in a suit brought by the Biden administration.\nSince September, the law has banned the vast majority of abortions and sent women racing to get care beyond the borders of the nation\u2019s second most populous state.\n\u201cA state may not ban abortions at six weeks. Texas knew this, but it wanted a six-week ban anyway, so the state resorted to an unprecedented scheme of vigilante justice that was designed to scare abortion providers and others who might help women exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d justice department attorney Brian Netter told the court.\nThe suit seeks to land the first legal blow against the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8 (SB8), which thus far has withstood an early wave of requests to block it, including at the supreme court.\nThe law, signed by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, in May, prohibits abortions in Texas once embryonic cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks. That is before some women know they are pregnant, and 18 weeks before a fetus can survive outside the womb.\nThe case was heard by Robert Pitman, a US district judge and appointee of Barack Obama. The landmark 1973 supreme court decision Roe v Wade guarantees women the right to an abortion until that point, called \u201cviability\u201d by courts and generally understood to be about 24 weeks gestation.\nHowever, lawmakers designed Texas\u2019s law to skirt judicial review by banning state officials from enforcing it. Instead, it deputizes private individuals to sue and seek a $10,000 penalty for anyone who aids a woman in obtaining an abortion, from doctors to cab drivers.\n\u201cThis is not some kind of vigilante scheme,\u201d said Will Thompson, defending the law for the Texas attorney general\u2019s Office. \u201cThis is a scheme that uses the normal, lawful process of justice in Texas.\u201d\nTo date, at least two lawsuits have been filed against a Texas doctor who publicly said he performed an abortion that violated the law. In an essay published by the Washington Post, Dr Alan Braid wrote: \u201cI acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.\u201d\nBoth suits were both filed by disbarred out-of-state attorneys. Another precedent-shattering aspect of Texas\u2019s law allows anyone, anywhere, regardless of their connection to an abortion, to sue those who help a woman terminate a pregnancy.\nThe law was allowed to go into effect because the supreme court refused to block it, while not commenting on the constitutional merits, in a stunning five-four decision by the court\u2019s conservative majority.\nIn the short time since the law took effect on 1 September, abortion providers said \u201cexactly what we feared\u201d has become reality, and described Texas clinics in danger of closing, while neighboring states struggle to keep up with a surge of patients driving hundreds of miles to seek abortion care. Other women, they said, are forced to carry pregnancies to term.\n\u201cAbortion care has almost completely stopped in our state,\u201d Dr Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas abortion provider, told the US House oversight and reform committee during a hearing over abortion access on Thursday.\nIt is unclear how soon Pitman will decide. It is also unclear how quickly any of Texas\u2019s nearly two dozen abortion clinics would move to resume normal operations if the law is set aside. Texas officials would probably seek a swift reversal from the conservative fifth US circuit court of appeals, the same court which allowed the restrictions to take effect, and set up the supreme court\u2019s decision not to block the law.\nThe Texas law is one of the biggest tests of abortion rights in the US in generations, and it is part of a decades-long push by Republicans nationwide to end access to abortion.\nIn December, the US supreme court will hear arguments on whether Mississippi can enforce a 15-week abortion ban. Like Texas\u2019s SB8, the law blatantly violates the essential holdings of Roe v Wade, by banning abortion nine weeks before a fetus can survive outside the womb.\nThe decision, likely to be released in June 2022, will have national ramifications for women\u2019s ability to access abortion. More than half of US states are openly hostile to abortion rights, even as 59% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances.",

I was born in Great (as it was then) Britain in the early 1950s and was soon packed off for privilege-conditioning at private boarding schools. In the 1980s I fled Thatcherism and nuclear threats, finally ending up in Aotearoa/New Zealand.\nIt has taken the 35 years since then of listening to M\u0101ori to begin to understand the extent of colonial conditioning. It is a deeply embedded mindset that feels like the only norm to the perpetrators. But it is a corrosive belittling of all \u201cthe other\u201d as being lesser. Implicit in colonialism are racism, patriarchy and excess individualism or egotism.\nM\u0101ori were beaten at school for speaking their language. Te reo is the means of relating to whenua or land, where words can be found to express unique flora or histories. If you lose a language, you lose connection to land. M\u0101ori say: \u201cI am the land and the land is me.\u201d What are they without land? They had to watch the native trees, that only they knew how to name, being torn down and burned, to be replaced by grass, insects, birds, animals and crops that were imported from a foreign land.\nThis happened because the colonists believed, without question, that their way was superior \u2013 and often that it was their God-given duty to impose it on the natives. But what is less well discussed is that this mindset persists today. The wealth of developed nations is predicated on much of the world being poor. And it is the poor who suffer disproportionately from the damaging effects of that wealth. In Aotearoa, M\u0101ori fill our prisons and live in our worst housing. Many p\u0101keh\u0101 (white people) today still speak of them in the same way as their colonial forebears. The trauma festers on.

At about 11am, a third group blocked junction 25 of the M25, near Enfield.\nLong queues of traffic formed at blockades, with drivers sounding their horns in frustration, according to PA Media. The Metropolitan police said the M4 blockade was cleared by 9am, with 13 arrests, and the M1 blockade by 10am, with 17 arrests. The M25 blockade was cleared by midday, with nine further arrests.\nInsulate Britain has said its activists will keep returning to block motorways around London until the government \u201cmakes a meaningful statement indicating that they will insulate all of Britain\u2019s 29m leaky homes by 2030, which are among the oldest and most energy inefficient in Europe\u201d.\nAmong the activists taking part in actions on Friday were eight who were released from police custody on Thursday, after blocking the M25 at junction 30 in Essex, and others who were arrested earlier this week, the group said.\nIt admitted activists\u2019 actions were in breach of an injunction, obtained last week by the government, which means anyone blocking the M25 could be found in contempt of court. If prosecuted, they could each face up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine.\nOrganisers had expected some activists taking part in the protests would have been jailed already. A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cThe government could end this tomorrow one way or another either by making a meaningful statement we can trust \u2026 or by sending our members to prison.\u201d\nInsulate Britain says 115 people have taken part in protests resulting in nearly 450 arrests, with some activists arrested six or seven times. So far, two have been held on remand and, after routine challenges by lawyers, both were released after about a week, the group\u2019s spokesperson said.\nEarlier this week, Lisa Townsend, Surrey\u2019s police and crime commissioner, said it was difficult to bring charges against the group, with minor charges likely to be discontinued and more serious charges having too high a threshold to meet.\nInsulate Britain has said its campaign is open-ended and will continue until its demands are met.\nThe group said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible that the government is continuing to delay action on home insulation when we urgently need to cut our carbon emissions, eliminate fuel poverty and help hard-working families with their rising energy bills.\n\u201cAdded to which, industry is crying out for the government to show some leadership and get behind a national retrofitting strategy. Come on Boris: get on with the job.\u201d\nSir Stephen House, the deputy commissioner of the Met, told the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee on Thursday that he was concerned police forces were under so much pressure to quickly clear the protests that \u201cofficers are putting their lives at risk\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThey started off on the slip roads, which is bad enough, but we\u2019ve now moved on to the main carriageways of the M25, which is absolute lunacy.\u201d\nAn Insulate Britain spokesperson said motorway carriageways had been targeted \u201csince day one\u201d.",

Maybe I\u2019ll get an opportunity now? I think it\u2019s very important to do something besides football.\u201d\nMaier is the sort of person, and player, who never skimps on her homework.

While that pair\u2019s thriving businesses, in Manchester and the hills above Zagreb respectively, appeal to caffeine purists, Maier aims to attract a broader audience. \u201cI really enjoy cooking and baking,\u201d she says. \u201cI like making people happy so I love trying out new restaurants and getting new ideas for my kitchen.\u201d\nFor the moment though such reconnaissance missions take second place to helping Everton achieve this season\u2019s ambition of Champions League qualification before playing in next summer\u2019s delayed European Championship in England.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got off to a great start \u2013 the first two games weren\u2019t that good,\u201d she acknowledges, referring to the 4-0 defeats against Manchester City and Chelsea sustained in their opening WSL fixtures. \u201cWe can do so much better but, in the last game, it was really important to win.\u201d\nThat 3-1 victory over Birmingham not only marked Maier\u2019s debut but her first goal for Everton. \u201cScoring was nice but the three points were much more important,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of things to improve on but we\u2019ve had eight new signings this summer, we\u2019re a very international squad and it takes time to build a team. We need to come together a little bit more but we\u2019re in a good place now. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\nMaier\u2019s experience and sheer will to win, forged through her involvement with Germany\u2019s Euro 2013 and Olympic 2016 triumphs and six years at Bayern Munich, are key reasons why Willie Kirk signed a defender boasting 78 caps.\n\u201cI guess I have the winning mentality deep inside me,\u201d says the health management graduate who relished the logistical challenges of combining football with studying for a degree. \u201cI think if you want to achieve something you must have that mindset. I hope I can help push Everton on further with my experience, not only on the pitch but, also, off it.\n\u201cIt was important for me to join an ambitious club. I don\u2019t just want to play, I want to win. Willie Kirk\u2019s very ambitious for this club. He wants us to be the best we can be in every training exercise. That\u2019s how I am as well. I know how important it is to keep working hard if you want to achieve something.\u201d\nFun matters too and Everton\u2019s dressing-room camaraderie has been bolstered by Toni Duggan\u2019s return to her native Merseyside from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this summer. \u201cNow I understand Toni\u2019s jokes I\u2019m always laughing,\u201d says Maier, who felt in need of a new challenge after losing her place at Arsenal last season. \u201cShe\u2019s got a strong Liverpool accent and, at the start, it was very hard to understand but now I\u2019m getting used to it. Everyone\u2019s been very welcoming. It\u2019s been easy to settle down.\u201d\nIt helps that her boyfriend makes regular trips to Merseyside from Germany and her parents flew in to surprise Maier on her 29th birthday last Wednesday but, having grown up with three older brothers near Stuttgart, she swiftly learned to stand on her own two feet.\n\u201cMy brothers all played football so every day they took me to the pitch,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere were no female teams in my village so I started in a boys\u2019 side at the age of seven. I can really recommend learning with boys; you have to learn to cope physically and to make quick decisions. I was 17 before I stopped playing in mixed teams and that benefited me. It\u2019s been very important to my game.\u201d\nMaier\u2019s influence will be vital as Everton travel to Reading on Sunday. \u201cWe need another three points,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to keep winning.\u201d\nGet to know the players in England\u2019s top flight better with our WSL player in focus series.

        "content": "Exclusive: England and Wales figures show \u2018epidemic\u2019 of flashing against women, after allegations against Wayne Couzens emerged\nWomen are facing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of flashing and other forms of indecent exposure, with police in England and Wales recording more than 10,000 cases last year but taking fewer than 600 people to court over them, Guardian analysis reveals.\nThe findings come after Wayne Couzens was reported for repeated instances of alleged indecent exposure in the years and days before he raped and murdered Sarah Everard, but faced no action. Police accepted they may have had enough clues to identify the police officer as a threat to women sooner, amid fears that flashing is a gateway to other sex crimes.\nOne in 10 women have been subjected to indecent exposure, and more than 113,000 last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Crime Survey for England and Wales.\nPolice recorded 10,775 cases of \u201cexposure and voyeurism\u201d in the year to March 2020, the ONS shows, while just 594 suspects were taken to court, resulting in 435 guilty verdicts, Ministry of Justice figures for 2020 reveal.\nThe victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales said indecent exposure was rarely taken seriously by police. Vera Baird urged police forces to rigorously record and investigate reports of indecent exposure, as potential precursors to more serious sexual offences.\n\u201cIt really seems to be an epidemic,\u201d Baird said. \u201cI hardly know a woman who hasn\u2019t been flashed. It clearly is endemic and it needs to be taken seriously, particularly because I think that attitude that it discloses is quite risky.\u201d\nHer comments came as Boris Johnson gave his backing to Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, saying \u201cwe can trust the police\u201d but admitting \u201cthere is a problem\u201d with the way violence against women was handled.\nIn 2015 a male motorist reported Couzens driving naked from the waist down, while days before Everard\u2019s disappearance he is alleged to have exposed himself to a female staff member at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant.\nA report from the police inspectorate published last month said 50% of women who responded to a public survey said they felt unsafe in public spaces, while the ONS found that two out of three women aged 16 to 34 had experienced harassment in the previous 12 months, and 29% felt as if they were being followed.\nBaird said: \u201cToo often the police don\u2019t take indecent exposure seriously. Any reports need rigorous recording to build up an intelligence picture [because] the possibilities of escalation can\u2019t be avoided.\u201d\nDr Fiona Vera-Gray, an assistant professor at the department of sociology at Durham University and an expert on sexual violence and harassment, said ONS statistics \u2013 showing at least one in 10 women aged 16 to 74 said they had been a victim of indecent exposure since turning 16 \u2013 were likely to be an underestimate.\n\u201cFrom an early age, women are taught to doubt ourselves and not take exposure seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to think differently about what the harm is, what it means. It\u2019s saying to women: \u2018I could hurt you; there is nothing in me to stop me from showing you my penis, it has a threat attached to it \u2026 Look at what I can do to you, look at how I can humiliate you,\u2019 the ever-present threat of sexual violence.\u201d\nThe data shows that 5.8% or about one in 17 of all adults say they have been a victim of indecent exposure since they turned 16.\nOut of the 594 exposure allegations that went to the courts, 123 resulted in immediate custodial sentences, with the average length of custody six and a half months. Community sentences were imposed for 189 offences.\nJayne Butler, the chief executive of Rape Crisis, said: \u201cIndecent exposure is a sexual offence and causes distress to those who experience it. Sexual assaults of this kind are sometimes viewed as \u2018low-level\u2019 sexual offences and this can deter people from reporting it as they don\u2019t believe it will be taken seriously.\n\u201cWe do see cases where a perpetrator escalates their behaviour and goes on to commit other sexual offences but in any case we would expect the police to take seriously and investigate any sexual offence reported to them.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cCrimes like indecent exposure often indicate an individual\u2019s need for attention and sense of sexual entitlement \u2013 the scale of indecent exposure offending in the stats is reflective of a culture that tolerates toxic masculinity that must be challenged. These offences cause distress to victims and they can be indicators that a perpetrator has attitudes that might lead to further offending if not taken seriously.\u201d",

        "content": "As Auckland grapples with Delta outbreak, opposition leaders dare to break with Jacinda Ardern on pandemic plan\n\u201cThings have changed,\u201d Judith Collins declares, sitting in her Beehive government office. New Zealand\u2019s National party leader is fresh off launching her alternative pandemic response plan, marking the first time the main opposition has significantly diverged from prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s largely popular elimination strategy.\nThe arrival of the Delta variant in New Zealand two months ago, causing an outbreak that the government is struggling to stamp out, has shown that elimination is \u201cclearly not working,\u201d Collins says.\nUntil now, New Zealand has been widely lauded for its approach, enduring fewer lockdowns compared to other nations and suffering just 27 deaths.\nThough the opposition has criticised the government for its slow vaccine rollout and the chaotic system to allow New Zealanders to come home, the elimination plan itself has enjoyed broad cross-party support.\nBut as Auckland, the centre of the Delta outbreak, toils through its second month of lockdown, the consensus is beginning to fracture. The country\u2019s largest city is currently in a level 3 lockdown \u2013 the second highest setting \u2013 while the rest of the country is able to enjoy relative freedom, though with some limitations on gatherings and requirements for mask-use.\nThe government\u2019s strategy to stamp out community transmission has relied on strict border measures, short lockdowns when cases emerge, and rapid contact tracing. It has been imperfect at times, but largely a successful one. It has committed to pursuing this policy, despite recent moves deemed to be \u201ca calculated risk\u201d, calling the strategy into question.\nIt is a method that has garnered both international curiosity and widespread domestic support, so much so, that it led the government to an overwhelming majority at the 2020 election, and has positioned Ardern well above her peers in the preferred prime minister ranks \u2013 33 points ahead of her nearest competition.\nIt may come as no surprise then that challenging a strategy delivered by one of the most popular leaders and governments in the country\u2019s recent political history, as an opposition party, could be at best be construed as tone deaf, and at worst, a death wish. When the former National party leader, Simon Bridges did so in 2020, the public backlash led to a rapid tumble in his popularity and he was dumped from leadership.\nBut this week, as the number of Covid cases bounced from 12 cases one day to 45 the next, the political right pronounced elimination dead. Both National and its smaller rival, the ACT party, want to do away with it in favour of \u201cvigorous suppression\u201d. Both want to open the borders sooner rather than later, and both want to end lockdowns for good.\nUntil recently, Collins had been \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the initial response to the pandemic.\n\u201cEven though it did take a little while to close the borders, they got on to it \u2026 the soundest move seemed to be to go into lockdowns, until we could assess as a country what was the right response,\u201d she says.\nThen Delta came along, and Collins believes it has rendered the government\u2019s response \u201cinadequate\u201d.\nOptions such as rapid antigen testing, saliva testing, stronger contact tracing methods and purpose-built managed isolation facilities should be seized upon, she says. \u201cThey have just slightly been asleep at the wheel.\u201d\nCollins says the country cannot continue down the path of lockdowns and is advocating for nation-wide lockdowns to be scrapped once 75% of the eligible population is vaccinated and reopening the border once 85% is vaccinated. Recent modelling from research centre Te P\u016bnaha Matatini suggests that at that rate, there could still be up to 7,000 deaths and 60,000 hospitalisations.\nBut Collins says that while \u201cno deaths are acceptable\u201d, she is a realist.\n\u201cWhen I get out of bed every morning, like everyone else does, and we go out and get into a car, we go on a cycle or a bike or a walk, there is always a danger.\u201d\nThe party did not create their own modelling for their plan, instead opting to have it \u201cthoroughly vetted\u201d by experts working in the public sector, but Collins has declined to publicly name them for fear they will be ostracised.\nThe libertarian ACT party leader David Seymour, who released his own Covid response plan, has been less generous about the government\u2019s Covid response, calling it \u201cbumbling\u201d.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it as an elimination strategy, I would describe it as a sporadic eradication strategy,\u201d Seymour said.\nHe said using short, sharp, lockdowns and then reaping the benefits of a Covid-free community \u201cno longer stacks up\u201d with Delta. He believes the government is aware of this by signalling a desire to end lockdowns and reconnect with the world, but says they don\u2019t have a coherent plan to do so.\nEarlier in the month, the government signalled that its reopening plan, unveiled just days before the outbreak would have to be completely re-worked after the outbreak. But perhaps the prospect of closed borders is not as undesirable as the political right believes \u2013 delays to the plan have not made a particularly large dent in the government\u2019s popularity.\nThere has been ongoing high-level public support the government\u2019s approach, which has been borne out in its election results and the most recent polls, says the co-director of the Public Policy Institute, Lara Greaves. One survey last month showed three-quarters of New Zealanders supported the use of lockdowns, at least until vaccination targets had been reached.\nThere is anecdotal data about more people breaking lockdown moods, but there is nothing to suggest there has been a large decrease in support for the government and its strategy, Greaves adds.\nBeing an opposition party during a crisis is a difficult place to be, Greaves says, and more so in New Zealand where the government has \u201cobjectively done extremely well\u201d.\nIt makes sense then, for the political right to focus on the economy\u2019s recovery, in order to define themselves in the response, even if the economy has done well by international standards, Greaves said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the potential for where a centre-right party could present a positive future.\u201d\nFor Collins, departing from the elimination strategy is just \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d, she says, adding that to dwell on the government\u2019s past mistakes is not going to fix anything.\n\u201cI actually see that one of the problems my predecessors went through is: it was seen to be not the right time to be talking about the failures, as the government was trying to deal with what was essentially a wartime footing \u2026 So that is why we\u2019re very focused on the future.\u201d",

Premiers and chief ministers backed in the new funding demand during Friday\u2019s national cabinet discussion.\nThe letter warns Australia\u2019s hospital systems are \u201centering the most critical phase of the Covid-19 pandemic response for our hospital systems\u201d.\n\u201cAll states and territories require immediate additional commonwealth funding to support pressures currently on our health systems,\u201d the letter says. \u201cStates and territories are under unrelenting strain due to the current Covid-19 demands and the pre-existing trend of increased hospital activity.\n\u201cThe increase in activity is compounded by the rapid increase in service delivery costs due to additional infection control procedures, PCR testing, maintenance of bed capacity during fluctuating demand, and capacity to respond to surges in Covid-19 cases.\u201d\nThe letter notes that it will take \u201cseveral years\u201d for the additional service delivery costs to be reflected in the efficient price for activity contained in the national funding model for hospitals. That time lag, the state and territory ministers say, will create \u201crisks around sustaining services until then\u201d.\n\u201cThis effective underpayment for activity occurs at the same time that the Australian government has stopped its Covid-19 funding guarantee to health services,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWe need an urgent, practical, collaborative funding solution until we get to a living with Covid point, and the national funding model has time to reflect these higher costs.\u201d\nThis week, one of Victoria\u2019s largest public hospitals was forced to close its Covid screening clinic and divert resources to emergency and intensive care patients, as the state\u2019s health system strains under pressure from a surge in cases.\nNSW hospitals are trying to recruit nurses from interstate and overseas to help cope with the predicted peak in Covid cases later this month.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe states and territories have also told Hunt they need \u201cinnovative funding solutions to manage the high number of Covid-19 cases that will be managed in the community\u201d.\n\u201cAs cases have increased, most people with Covid-19 have been safely cared for in the community using models such as hospital in the home and Covid positive pathways, which are funded by the states and territories.\n\u201cCommonwealth support is now urgently required for funding of community Covid care, including hospital in the home and increased support for GP care of community Covid patients.\u201d\nThe jurisdictions have asked Hunt to retain the commonwealth\u2019s funding guarantee for a further three years, until June 2023 \u2013 and for 50-50 cost sharing between the commonwealth and the states and territories to continue \u201cuntil at least the end of 30 June 2023\u201d.\nThey have also asked for additional support to provide mental health services, and for full cost recovery for the care of all NDIS and aged care patients who are in the hospital system.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cThe admission of NDIS participants and older patients into our hospitals has continued unabated, and there has been no improvement in the discharge rates once these individuals are clinically ready for discharge,\u201d the letter to Hunt says.\nDuring Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting, the federal health secretary, Brendan Murphy, provided an update on the work he has been leading examining whether or not the health system can cope with the number of cases that are likely to occur once the lockdowns end.\nA further submission to that work, which has not yet been released publicly, was added on Friday. National cabinet is not expected to meet again until 5 November.\nFriday\u2019s national cabinet statement says premiers and chief ministers received advice about surge planning, and \u201call states and territories confirmed that effective systems were in place at a state and territory level\u201d.\nFurther analysis was sought about local health area networks, primary care networks, and \u201ccollaborative care pathways\u201d.",

Seven of the perpetrators were tried and found guilty. It is the only known case in Australia where white settlers were convicted and hanged for such crimes.\nEvery June, hundreds of people gather at the site for a memorial service where descendants of victims and perpetrators come together to mourn and acknowledge their shared history.\nThere was damage to buildings, sandstone steps and railings. A memorial plaque was also vandalised \u2013 but the committee is unsure if this was done by the same perpetrators.\nCo-chair of the national committee, Keith Munro, confirmed a racist slogan was also scratched into the ground.\nFounding and current committee member Marilyn Isaacs said the plaques along the memorial walk had been damaged before. With new additions to the memorial unveiled seven months ago, more security was needed at the site, she said.\n\u201cThis place is about reconciliation. I just feel sorry for these people,\u201d Isaacs said.\nThe Friends of Myall Creek committee formed in 1998 to raise awareness of the massacre. In a statement released on Friday, the committee called on members of the public to \u201cdo the right and honourable thing and report any suspicious activity they may have observed at the site\u201d.\n\u201cAny fair-minded human being would not defend the actions of those responsible,\u201d the committee said.\nThe NSW minister and local Nationals MP Adam Marshall condemned the vandalism.\n\u201cMore than 20 years of hard work has gone into transforming the Myall Creek memorial site into a place of cultural healing and reflection,\u201d Marshall said.\n\u201cUnnecessary acts like this do little to support the message of reconciliation the site was established to achieve. I hope those who caused damage take a good hard look at themselves and do the right thing by handing themselves in to NSW police.\u201d\nPolice said the damage occurred sometime in the past few months. Covid lockdowns have made it difficult to regularly visit the site.\n\u201cOn Friday 24 September 2021, officers \u2026 received reports the Myall Creek memorial had been damaged,\u201d NSW police said in a statement.\n\u201cA plaque has been scratched and an access handrail at the site has been removed and stolen. Due to the remote location of the memorial, it is believed the damage occurred between July and September 2021.\n\u201cLocal police have commenced an investigation into the incident and are appealing for anyone with information that may assist to come forward.\u201d\nThe memorial site was placed on the Australian national heritage list in 2008 and the NSW heritage register in 2010.\nIn June 1838, 28 Wirrayaraay people were tied up in daylight, forced to walk out of sight of the Myall Creek station huts, fired at with pistols and shotguns and then hacked and bludgeoned to death with swords and cutlasses. The bodies were burned the following day.\nThe massacre was carried out by a colonist, John Henry Fleming, and 11 stockmen.\nThe massacre was reported to the colonial secretary in Sydney who ordered an investigation by a magistrate. Fleming disappeared before the magistrate arrived at Gwydir River. The 11 stockmen were arrested and charged with murder and taken to Sydney for trial in the supreme court.\nSeven of the 12 were found guilty of murder and hanged \u2013 the only time colonists were punished for their part in a mass killing on the frontier.",

It\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m still in this business.\n\u201cThere are some managers, J\u00fcrgen is one, to challenge you to move a step forward \u2026 Here we have many years, many competitions together. Every game was nice, both teams have the same idea, go to score goals in different ways; quicker than us, but in the same way to win the games.\u201d\nKlopp was quick to return the compliment, although he was unsure whether he had ever informed his City counterpart of his real feelings given the intense rivalry of their teams in recent campaigns.\n\u201c[I am] not sure if I ever told Pep but I like him! It\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom time to time I annoy him with things I say in press conferences that are not meant to say anything bad about him or Man City but then somebody on the City staff tells him that \u2018Klopp said this or that\u2019 and I can see in his press conference that he gets really angry. Sorry for that!\n\u201cIt\u2019s really one of the biggest challenges for all managers in football to face his teams because they are good. If you make a mistake you get punished and that is pretty much the game against Man City always. So you had better not make a lot of mistakes because otherwise you will get a knock. But if you don\u2019t [make mistakes] \u2013 at least if you are Liverpool \u2013 then you have a chance and I really think it is interesting to give it a try.\u201d\nTwo goals from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan in a thumping 4-1 victory ended City\u2019s 18-year wait for a win at Anfield last season, although the Germany midfielder and Oleksandr Zinchenko remain sidelined and are expected back after the international break. Liverpool have conceded only once at home in the league, in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea, but Guardiola does not expect his players to be intimidated by the presence of supporters this time.\n\u201cI am sure the players enjoy more to play with fans in Anfield than without,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win at Anfield, I don\u2019t know the reasons, the last four, five years [before last year] because it\u2019s an exceptional team. The crowd helps, like in Paris, but it happens in big stadiums: in Germany at Dortmund, or Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. It happens, not a lot for intimidation but the quality of the opponent. We do our game with or without spectators.\u201d",

He returned for last week\u2019s win over Norwich, and is available for Saturday\u2019s visit to Manchester United, but with the keeper feeling the effects of the injury during the defeat of Daniel Farke\u2019s side, Ben\u00edtez believes the World Cup qualifier provides an opportunity to rest Pickford and aid his recovery. Sam Johnstone and Aaron Ramsdale are the other keepers selected to face Andorra and Hungary.\nThe Everton manager said: \u201cHe is fit to play for us and he is fit to play for England. I don\u2019t want to be disrespectful but some of the games are nothing games and so I think it is easy to manage. Of the two games that they have, I would say for one of them they can manage.\u201d\nEverton continue to have injury problems, with Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and the captain, S\u00e9amus Coleman, sidelined. Ben\u00edtez is likely to face his former Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo on Saturday and, despite the veteran\u2019s impressive impact, insists United cannot rely on one world-class talent to challenge for the title.\n\u201cIf you have a player that can win you a game then you try to manage the players around him so that, if he is a finisher like Cristiano, you give him the balls,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cIt is as simple as that. You have to try to find him in the right position, and give him a lot of assists and crosses. But normally, if you want to win titles and compete during the season, you cannot rely on one player because if he gets injured it is a massive problem.\n\u201cYou have to have a structure and a team that is strong enough. These type of players, these individuals, make a team better but the team has to be strong. If you depend on one player maybe you can be lucky one year or two, but you cannot win trophies if you do not have good players around the best players.\u201d",

After a rocky debut at Brentford and a subsequent absence with Covid-19 he has started the past three games, all of which Arsenal have won. Last Sunday he kept Harry Kane quiet in the victory over Spurs and Arteta hopes this is just the beginning.\n\u201cWe brought him because we believe that he can be extraordinary,\u201d Arteta said of White, who turns 24 next Friday. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that much experience in the league still. He has experience with Leeds and the experience he had with Brighton for a year, so he is not mature in that sense, but he has already shown his qualities and what he can do. The way he has adapted to us is impressive so the potential is there.\u201d\nArteta pointed out that what appears now to be his first-choice back five of Aaron Ramsdale, White, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and Kieran Tierney are all 24 or under. He admitted that is \u201cunusual\u201d, but said they \u201chave the right maturity because they have different experiences\u201d. Part of the reasoning for signing White was his ability to build from the back but the manager is happy with his dedication to the game\u2019s muckier side.\n\u201cHe has to defend first \u2026 and that\u2019s his biggest task,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that we bought him because he has that ability to break lines, to progress the ball the way we want it. He has that composure and calmness to make the right decision. But first of all he needs to defend and I think he is doing that really, really well.\u201d\nArteta rejected a suggestion from Bernd Leno that the goalkeeper was given \u201cno clear reason\u201d for his recent replacement in the side by Ramsdale. \u201cI had a very clear conversation with him 48 hours before I was going to make the decision,\u201d he said.\nArsenal hope another midweek clear of European football will bring benefits as they look to put pressure on the top six, even though it is a decidedly mixed blessing for Arteta. \u201cI want to be playing in Europe and I want to be competing there, and every time I see the Champions League music my stomach hurts.\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I enjoy. We have to make the most out of it because we have more time during the week to prepare but certainly it\u2019s not where we want to be.\u201d",

        "content": "Bristol\u2019s joy at securing their first win of the season was swiftly diluted on Friday night after it emerged their star player, Semi Radradra, will be sidelined for the next four months. The Fijian centre will undergo a knee operation on Monday and is unlikely to be sighted again on a rugby pitch until late January at the earliest.\nRadradra originally sustained the injury in the semi-finals of the sevens competition at the Tokyo Olympics and it has now been decided that surgery is required. \u201cThe good news is that the surgery will fix it 100%,\u201d said Pat Lam, Bristol\u2019s director of rugby. \u201cThere is a lot of rugby to be played when he gets back but we will certainly be on the lookout for a replacement to come in for the period of time when he is out.\u201d\nAny side in the world would miss Radradra\u2019s compelling blend of power and dexterity but at least Bristol now have a victory to ease their frustration at this latest blow to their best-laid plans. Having lost their opening two matches they were suitably grateful for the two second-half yellow cards which reduced Bath to 13 players and a 67th-minute converted try for replacement hooker Jake Kerr which finally put them ahead in a breathless contest.\nThis latest West Country ding-dong was never remotely dull and often entertainingly helter-skelter, with Bristol never entirely able to establish full control despite largely dominating the set scrums. Not without good reason was Kyle Sinckler, on his first game back following the summer British & Lions tour, named the man of the match.\nSinckler had personally sought permission to resume playing ahead of schedule, having sent a message to Lam last week pleading to be involved. \u201cI had a duty to step up,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you just have to get on with it. I can\u2019t just sit in meetings and train and not contribute. I know there was a mandatory rest time but I pride myself on being virtuous and I try to be so committed in everything I do. I love the game and I love playing.\u201d\nHow Bath could have done with a pumped-up Lion in their front five. Clearly these are early days but a third successive Premiership defeat represents their worst start to a league season for 16 years, even if there were sufficient flickers of promise from their young backs to offer some longer-term encouragement.\nMax Ojomoh and Orlando Bailey were highly impressive on a raucous Bristolian evening. The Bears, beaten by Saracens and Wasps in their opening two fixtures, displayed some slick early ball-handling but their defensive positioning was less sure, allowing the galloping Will Muir to slice through for the game\u2019s first try after 18 minutes. With Bailey adding a penalty to his conversion, Bath were 10-3 up and clearly beginning to fancy it.\nIf so, they underestimated their hosts\u2019 determination to strike back hard and fast. Bristol\u2019s inspirational captain, Steven Luatua, is no one\u2019s idea of a jinking midfield back but the big man dummied his way into acres of space and finished with an extravagant dive. Even Radradra would have struggled to do it much better.\nThe watching England head coach, Eddie Jones, will also have admired the lovely combination of passes down the blindside just before half-time which created Bath\u2019s second try for Semesa Rokoduguni in the right corner. At 15-11 with half an hour to play it felt like anyone\u2019s game, only for a brilliant 52nd-minute score from Bath to extend their advantage. Having been presented with yet more turnover ball, Bailey put in a smart cross-kick from which Muir exchanged passes with Ojomoh to surge over for his second try.\nOnce again, though, it served merely to rouse Bristol afresh and a concerted 58th-minute forward drive yielded a penalty try and a yellow card for Tom Ellis for collapsing the maul. When Bath also lost Tom Dunn for a similar offence, with the home crowd now baying for blood, there was no way back. A bye weekend is set to provide them with some temporary respite but, with tricky fixtures against Saracens, Quins, Wasps, Leicester and Exeter to follow, they badly need to shore up their set piece before heavier winter pitches become the norm.",

Black Emperor song, appears unbidden in my head as we walk across the red-carpeted concourse into the newly opened Cali Beach Club in Surfers Paradise. It arrives there on a more or less daily basis, every time I look at the news and find out that, oh I don\u2019t know, climate change-induced fire tornadoes are speeding up the incubation of the ultra omega variant of the novel coronavirus.\nThis is not to say, obviously, that the Cali Beach is another link in a frighteningly long and varied chain of ecological disasters, feeding into public health disasters, feeding into climate disasters, into civil unrest. It is rather, a 5,000-sq metre, \u201cpremier adults-only playground\u201d (their words), \u201cAustralia\u2019s largest day and night entertainment precinct\u201d and \u201cthe ultimate Day Club experience\u201d (also their words). The development took around 12 months to realise, at a cost of almost $10m.\nOpened on 24 September, the sprawling, Las Vegas-style, open-air rooftop complex comprises several bars, several pools, a cinema, reservable daybeds, reservable booths and poolside VIP areas styled as \u201ccabanas\u201d. The cabanas are also reservable, if you happen to have a tidy five grand or so hidden in your couch cushions.\nI was once young enough to have the psychic fortitude to go to nightclubs, and when I attend on 25 September, the club has all the hallmarks I remember. The lighting is low, so that I don\u2019t feel too self-conscious about my ridiculous attempt to guess the dress code. People jostle for position at a bar staffed by God\u2019s most patient bartenders, hoping that if they scream loud enough the staff will correctly ascertain the number of shots they are trying to order. A DJ is playing amorphous club music that never seems to resolve into a single discrete song. Recognisable hooks drift in and out of an otherwise unchanging beat, making me feel like I\u2019m on my deathbed, trying my best to recollect the pop songs of my youth.\nBut most importantly: it is fun. It is a fun place. People are having fun.\nI am not a particularly fun person, so I have brought a fun person with me, and it is working. My unswervingly social, certified \u201cparty goblin\u201d ex, George, has agreed to come on the proviso they can smash a few dirty martinis on a newspaper\u2019s dime. In exchange they will act as my shaman, magicking me into the world of people who enjoy themselves at nightclubs.\nUnfailingly, George casts their spell. Several people approach them to ask if they are selling cocaine. Still more approach them just to chat, because that\u2019s the sort of thing that happens when you are fun, like George. Two people also approach me, but both times it is men telling me that my \u201clook\u201d is \u201cinteresting\u201d. I was wrong about the lighting being low enough \u2013 I feel as obvious as a neon sign of a cartoon clown.\nHere, on this rooftop, as Blade Runner-esque tongues of flame shoot into the sky and fire twirlers in booty shorts walk through a packed crowd of 20-somethings, the people we talk to are having the normalest Saturday night of their lives.\nAmid what feels like an ongoing apocalypse that is gradually increasing in volume, the perfectly ordinary social dynamics of a night out are happening as they have for, presumably, thousands of years.\nThe punters are dressed predominantly in sexy Halloween costume versions of lawn bowl whites. Young men aggressively yell at each other in a way that could indicate either delight or a threat of violence; young women tearfully clutch at their friends, anchoring each other to the material plane. Someone next to me at the urinal laments that there isn\u2019t anywhere to put your drink down while you\u2019re pissing. A man orders around $200 worth of cocktails and then wanders off, never to be seen by the bar staff again. A young woman in a peach-coloured cocktail dress mimes having penetrative sex with one of her similarly becocktaildressed mates while teetering dangerously close to the pool.\nThere is a lifeguard \u2013 stationed in a chair all evening, despite the complete absence of any swimmers \u2013 taking all of this in. He has the unfocused eyes of someone trying to solve a complicated maths problem, or win an argument in their head that they have already lost in real life.\nThis sort of spectacle, quite literally held above the masses on a fifth-floor rooftop, would be a lazy filmmaker\u2019s hack visual metaphor for one of the movie\u2019s capital T Themes. And it is all about spectacle; the soft launch for influencers and VIPs, held the night prior, featured a man doing acrobatic flips with some sort of aquatic jetpack, while a man beside him, in a dazzling feat of logistics, revved a jetski in a small rooftop pool.\nTonight, at indeterminate intervals, a parade of neon-coloured sea creatures held aloft by performers meanders throughout the space. Mobile strobe lights accompany women in matching swimsuits, carrying what I believe might be bottles of champagne. At one point, a fire twirler emerges Botticelli-style from a giant clamshell.\nThe spectacle is, frankly, cool as hell. If I were nearly anyone but myself I would probably have a tremendous time.\nInstead, I am sitting at the bar drinking a mid-strength beer (the car won\u2019t drive itself back to Brisbane, sadly), listening to a series of customers abuse a very stressed man who is trying to make a dozen cocktails simultaneously, and wondering whether this would look all that different if a big asteroid was scheduled to hit tomorrow.\nThe car\u2019s on fire, and there\u2019s no driver at the wheel.\nThe writer attended Cali Beach anonymously, with expenses covered by Guardian Australia\nBen McLeay is a Brisbane-based bartender who produces and co-hosts the comedy current events podcast Boonta Vista",

They said it was a key plank of \u201clevelling up\u201d.\nNo structural shake-up is expected in social care, it is understood, but the government could be open to more national leadership in the sector.\nNHS bosses criticised the review as a \u201cslap in the face\u201d after the pandemic.

This will go down really badly, like a vat of cold sick.\u201d\nNHS bosses also suspect the government has been \u201cstung\u201d by publicity around the fact that leaders of some of the new NHS \u201cintegrated care systems\u201d \u2013 44 regional groupings of health organisations across England that will become operational in April \u2013 will earn about \u00a3250,000, a lot more than the prime minister.\nMatthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital trusts, warned that the review could hinder health service leaders.\nHe said: \u201cAs the NHS changes and moves to system leadership, it is right that we need new leadership skills and approaches. But if we are going to look at leadership and leadership qualities, then we also need to review the context in which our leaders are operating.\n\u201cThe operating environment is among the most fraught that NHS leaders have experienced and this review will need to support, not hinder, their progress.\u201d\nJohnson has tried to improve the Tories\u2019 reputation on the NHS since becoming prime minister, with Labour traditionally seen as more trusted on the health service.\nHe has promised \u00a336bn for health and social care after the Covid pandemic, focused on addressing rising waiting list times, raised from higher national insurance contributions.\nIn his announcement, Javid made clear the government would expect improvements from the NHS along with its extra budget commitment, even though it is focused on playing catch-up. \u201cWe are committed to providing the resources health and social care needs but that must come with change for the better,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis review will shine a light on the outstanding leaders in health and social care to drive efficiency and innovation. It will help make sure individuals and families get the care and treatment they need, wherever they are in the country, as we build back better.\u201d\nMessenger was the vice-chief of the defence staff from 2016 to 2019 and he worked as head of operations for the community testing programme. The Conservatives said he would have a team of officials from the Department of Health and Social Care and the NHS, led by Dame Linda Pollard, the chair of Leeds teaching hospital.",

        "content": "Joe Biden has made a rare visit to Capitol Hill to meet privately with House Democrats amid a stalemate that has put his sprawling domestic agenda in jeopardy.\nPledging to \u201cget it done\u201d after days of frantic negotiations that saw the party fail to strike an internal deal on a scaled-back version of Biden\u2019s $3.5tn social and environmental policy overhaul, the president hoped to break an impasse even as hopes of compromise before the weekend faded.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s in six minutes, six days, or six weeks \u2013 we\u2019re going to get it done,\u201d Biden said, as he exited the caucus room.\nThe visit comes a day after after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, delayed a vote on part of his economic agenda, a bipartisan $1tn public works measure, in an embarrassing setback. Democrats returned to the Capitol on Friday deeply divided but determined to make progress on Biden\u2019s ambitious economic vision.\nPelosi had earlier promised that there would a \u201cvote today\u201d on the infrastructure measure, which progressive House lawmakers have maintained they would not support unless it is passed in tandem with the far more expansive $3.5tn package.\nBut hopes that Biden had forged a truce among Democrats were dashed on Friday night when Josh Gottheimer, a leading moderate in the House, publicly condemned Pelosi for delaying the infrastructure vote.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s deeply regrettable that Speaker Pelosi breached her firm, public commitment to members of Congress and the American people to hold a vote and to pass the once-in-a-century bipartisan infrastructure bill on or before September 27,\u201d the congressman from New Jersey said in a statement.\n  Gottheimer added: \u201cWe cannot let this small faction on the far left \u2013 who employ Freedom Caucus tactics, as described by the New York Times today \u2013 destroy the president\u2019s agenda and stop the creation of two million jobs a year \u2013 including for the millions of hard-working men and women of labor.\u201d\n  The language appeared deliberately inflammatory. The reference to a \u201csmall faction on the far left\u201d was sure to infuriate progressives who claim to have the White House and the vast majority of the Democratic caucus on their side. The Freedom Caucus is a group of conservative Republicans intent on pushing party leadership to the right.\n  Gottheimer said: \u201cThis far-left faction is willing to put the president\u2019s entire agenda, including this historic bipartisan infrastructure package, at risk. They\u2019ve put civility and bipartisan governing at risk.\u201d\nIn a further sign of internal tensions, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York issued a sharp response to Gottheimer\u2019s assertions, tweeting that Biden had stood with Pelosi and 95% of House Democrats \u201cand said the opposite: that his historic vision for America first requires a Build Back Better reconciliation deal. That\u2019s the way a bipartisan infrastructure bill will win the votes to become law.\u201d\nPelosi confirmed there would be no infrastructure vote as more time was needed to negotiate.\n\u201cWhile great progress has been made in the negotiations to develop a House, Senate and White House agreement on the Build Back Better Act, more time is needed to complete the task,\u201d the House speaker said in a statement.\nDemocrats remained deeply at odds over the scale and structure of the more expansive package which contains a host of progressive priorities, provisions to expand healthcare access, establish paid leave, combat climate change and reduce poverty \u2013 all underwritten by tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations.\nDemocrats are trying to score a major legislative victory with razor-thin majorities in both chambers. Failure would deny Biden much of his domestic agenda, leaving the party with little to show for their time controlling the White House, the Senate and House.\nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has proposed a spending package of about $1.5tn \u2013 less than half the size of the proposal put forward by the president and Democratic leaders. Another Democratic centrist, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, declined to say whether she agreed with Manchin\u2019s proposal.\nIn the private meeting with House lawmakers, Biden reportedly discussed a compromise topline of $1.9tn to $2.3tn, according to a person in the room who spoke with the Associated Press.\nCongresswoman Madeleine Dean told MSNBC that Biden was \u201cpragmatic\u201d and \u201crealistic\u201d in the closed-door meeting with lawmakers. \u201cHe said, \u2018Look, clearly I have to be straight up with you. It is not going to be the $3.5tn number that we would all like, or many, many of us would like \u2026 What I ask of you are the programmatic things that must be in the bill, and then we can do the math from there\u2019,\u201d Dean said.\nHuddled together in an hours-long caucus meeting, Pelosi tried to steer the feuding factions within her party toward common ground after Thursday\u2019s marathon negotiating session generated deepening acrimony and no deal.\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emerged from the morning gathering optimistic that Democrats would eventually pass both bills. But she remained firm in her position \u2013 and confident in her members \u2013 that there the infrastructure bill would not move forward without assurances that the Senate would pass Biden\u2019s larger bill.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more progress in the last 48 hours than we\u2019ve seen in a long time on reconciliation,\u201d she said, crediting progressives\u2019 infrastructure revolt for forcing Manchin and Sinema to the negotiating table.\nThe decision to postpone the infrastructure vote was seen as a victory for progressives who were unwavering in their resolve to \u201chold the line\u201d and vote against the bill unless they received \u201cironclad\u201d commitments that Biden\u2019s proposed $3.5tn social and environmental package would also pass.\nMany progressives also say they will withhold support for the infrastructure bill until the Senate passes the second piece of Biden\u2019s economic agenda, legislation that has yet to be written. Jayapal made clear this was her preference, but later left the door open to the possibility that the party could reach an agreement without a vote.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something else that\u2019s short of a vote \u2026 that gives me those same assurances, I want to listen to that,\u201d she told reporters.\nThe stalemate also laid bare deep ideological fractures within the party. Unlike the debate over Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare legislation a decade ago, progressives appear to be more closely aligned with the president and able to flex their political muscles. On Thursday they were united in making the case that centrists are now in the minority.\nBoth pieces of legislation are critical to Biden\u2019s economic vision. While he has staked his domestic agenda \u2013 and his legacy \u2013 on a $3.5tn social policy package, he invested precious political capital in courting Republicans to support the infrastructure bill, part of a campaign promise to usher in a new era of bipartisanship in Congress. The bill passed the Senate in August, with 19 Republican votes and great fanfare.\nBut the spirit of bipartisanship dissipated quickly. In the House, Republican leaders lobbied members to vote against the bipartisan bill, forcing Democrats to come up with the votes on their own. Republicans are unified in opposition to the president\u2019s broader spending-and-tax plan.\nThe House is scheduled to leave Washington at the end of this week for a two-week recess but this could be delayed if no deal has been reached. Congress must also find a way to raise the debt ceiling to avoid the US defaulting for the first time in its history.",

        "content": "Judith Collins criticises America as \u2018foolish\u2019 for walking away from free trade agreements\nNew Zealand\u2019s opposition leader has hit out at the US and UK over China, saying their failure to adopt free trade agreements was \u201cfoolish\u201d and increased Chinese dominance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\u201cIf any criticism comes to New Zealand, as it often does about this close relationship with China and trade, my answer to everybody \u2013 whether they\u2019re the US or UK \u2013 is: \u2018So where\u2019s our free trade agreement?\u2019,\u201d Judith Collins, leader of the centre-right National party, said in an interview with the Guardian on Friday.\nFormer US president Donald Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2017 and the US did not join its replacement, the CPTPP. New Zealand began talks with the UK last year on a post-Brexit free trade deal, but it has not yet been made.\nCollins said the US had been \u201cfoolish\u201d to walk away from those free trade agreements. In doing so, Collins said: \u201cWhat they did is that they opened up the gates for China to be even more important in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific region. They opened that up, and they left the door open, and they were ultimately foolish to do so. And that has actually caused the issue.\n\u201cStop judging New Zealand by the fact that we are a little country at the bottom of the world who has to trade. That\u2019s how we do it. That\u2019s how we pay for everything we need.\u201d\nChina is New Zealand\u2019s largest trading partner by a substantial margin and accounts for about a third of total exports. According to the NZ China Council, exports to China last year were $16.7bn, more than New Zealand\u2019s trade with Australia, the US and Japan \u2013 its next three largest trade partners \u2013 combined. That has led to speculation New Zealand is unable to take tough stances on Beijing due to its trade dependency.\nThe Ardern government has been walking a difficult line on China issues \u2013 making case-by-case statements on human rights violations or encroachment in Hong Kong or the South China Sea but avoiding the more strongly stated, hawkish condemnations coming from the US or Australia. It has been watching the experience of its trans-Tasman neighbour closely: Australia has been hit by a hugely costly trade war with China, with enormous tariffs on most of its export commodities.\nProf David Capie, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University in Wellington, said trade was the missing link for US policy in the region.\n\u201cOver the past few months there\u2019s been a lot of attention paid to the US\u2019s security role in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 for example, the rapidly evolving quad and the new Aukus deal. But for many regional countries the missing part of US strategy is trade,\u201d Capie said.\n\u201cIf the US is concerned about China\u2019s growing influence, what alternatives is it providing to the huge gravitational pull of the Chinese economy? Free trade has always been a fraught issue in American politics and it\u2019s only got more challenging in the last few years. The result is that Washington really doesn\u2019t have a trade strategy to back up its wider aims.\n\u201cShared values are all well and good, but they don\u2019t keep the lights on.\u201d\nThis year \u200b\u200bNew Zealand, along with Australia, welcomed coordinated sanctions announced by the UK, US, the EU and Canada over Uyghur abuses, but did not institute sanctions of their own. In May, New Zealand shied away from using the word \u201cgenocide\u201d in a motion on Xinjiang debated and unanimously adopted by parliament \u2013 opting instead to use more general, watered-down language of \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d.\nAfter statements from foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta that New Zealand was \u201cuncomfortable with expanding the remit\u201d of the Five Eyes alliance, a UK conservative MP accused Ardern of \u201csucking up to China\u201d, and Australian media said the country had \u201csold its soul\u201d to preserve trade agreements.\nCollins said the opposition did not chime in with those criticisms. \u201cWe don\u2019t attack them [the government] on it because we know their problem. Their problem is who\u2019s going to pay the bills?\u201d\nCollins said there would be trade repercussions for New Zealand if it spoke out. \u201cThe problem is, [when] we go out there and we talk about the Uyghur people and what is clearly an appalling situation, what we know happens \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen it before \u2013 is that suddenly there are trade issues.\u201d\nCollins cited the recent example of Zespri, New Zealand\u2019s largest kiwifruit cooperative, having Covid-19 detected on its fruit in China \u2013 and strongly implied the case was political.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not stupid, we know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Collins said. Asked if the case was political retaliation, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve been around long enough in politics, and long enough in senior roles, to know that these things do happen.\u201d\nZespri\u2019s chief executive, Dan Mathieson, told Stuff on Monday that exports had been continuing as normal after the initial detection, and all subsequent tests had been negative.\nAustralia, the US and UK last month announced the new Aukus security pact \u2013 one that New Zealand were notably absent from and that experts said was an illustration of the distance between the country and its traditional allies.\n\u201cAukus doesn\u2019t include us and it doesn\u2019t include Canada, so we\u2019ve both been ignored from it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re being left out.\u201d\nShe said she was a firm supporter of New Zealand\u2019s nuclear-free policy, which bans nuclear-powered vessels \u2013 including those constructed under Aukus \u2013 from New Zealand waters. However, she also said: \u201cThe information sharing, the artificial intelligence work, the technology-sharing agreement part of Aukus \u2013 that was important that we were left out of that. You\u2019d have to wonder why Canada and New Zealand were excluded from that part of it.\u201d\nCollins is languishing in the polls, polling at just 5% as preferred prime minister, compared with Jacinda Ardern\u2019s 44%. Across parties, Labour is at 43% and National at 26%.\nThe Guardian has approached the foreign minister\u2019s office for comment.",

        "content": "After years of sexual abuse allegations, the R&B singer has finally had to face punishment for his crimes but will a wider reckoning follow?\nActivist Oronike Odeleye was at her desk, knee-deep in another 12-hour day of working from home, when the news hit. A friend called. The R&B performer and producer R Kelly had been found guilty on all nine counts in his sex trafficking case, he said. Initially, Odeleye felt \u201ca bit stunned, but also really relieved\u201d, she says, thinking first of the survivors who had bravely shared their testimony.\nTogether with Kenyette Tisha Barnes, Odeleye had founded the #MuteRKelly movement in 2017. The goal: a financial boycott of Kelly, given the years of child sexual abuse and sexual misconduct allegations made against the star. At the time, she had hoped to soon \u201cstep in the name of justice at his trial\u201d. On Monday 27 September, that day arrived. But as the week wore on, she wasn\u2019t convinced the industry was ready to examine itself more closely.\n\u201cThere is no morality in capitalism outside of profit,\u201d she says, plainly. \u201cI think that the machine of the industry has not changed. Its only morality is profit.\u201d Odeleye also works in entertainment, as an arts consultant and director of the Black-owned festival One MusicFest. From that vantage point, she reflects on how a financial bottom line drives the business.\nKelly\u2019s guilty verdict has been marked as an overdue symbol of reckoning for Black women and girl survivors. We\u2019re yet to see what this trial means for the music industry, though \u2013 how likely is this outcome to inspire a watershed moment of transformation?\nKelly\u2019s case laid bare a complex web of associates and enablers who facilitated his crimes. As it stands, there\u2019s a long way to go to protect fans, musicians and other workers in music from harassment and assault. The industry may struggle to shed a legacy of shielding those considered worthy \u2013 the talent, and arguably some executives \u2013 over those seen as dispensable. It would be naive to rely on the justice system\u2019s handling of sex trafficking in one trial as a blueprint for all future accountability. But it may be time for the music business to fully process how fame let Kelly get away with his abuse for so long.\nKelly seemed invincible before his 2019 arrest. Signed to Jive Records, he started his career in 1992, on an album with group Public Announcement. A year later, his solo debut 12 Play would propel the track Bump n\u2019 Grind to the top of the Billboard Hot R&B singles chart. Over decades, his discography spanned aspirational, graduation-montage gospel-soul, sexually explicit R&B and the multi-chapter, years-long chaos of the Trapped in the Closet \u201copera\u201d. But he was always considered a huge success, only failing to crack the Billboard 200 album chart top 10 with albums released from 2015 onwards.\nAs testimony throughout the six-week trial detailed, this star power granted Kelly god-like status among his fans as well as a hallowed place in Black music culture of the 1990s and 2000s. He came up at a time when young female fans were still easily dismissed, assumed to be sexual objects or musical lightweights more invested in how performers looked than how they sounded. That \u201cgroupie culture\u201d, inherited from 1970s and 1980s rock, set the tone.\nOdeleye remembers how, at the start of the #MuteRKelly campaign, she and Barnes were mostly pelted with online hate and harassment \u2013 the language they used to talk about the abuse wasn\u2019t yet mainstream. They pressed on, engaging those who would listen. \u201cWe had a lot of conversations about what sexuality means, what grooming is and how it works, the kind of manipulation that abusers use \u2013 you talk about it in a more holistic way than, \u2018some gold diggers and a Black man they\u2019re trying to take down\u2019, you know?\u201d\nKelly and his enablers recruited young women and children at his concerts or at schools. This behaviour was overlooked, seen simply as a superstar blessing his fans with his presence (and phone number). Groupie culture forms a foundation on which fan-celebrity interactions can cross back and forth over the line of consent, within an acceptable catch-all. Its heavily gendered norms shape fans and those in the industry alike.\nTo truly enact change, those with power need to push back against these norms, according to Naomi Pohl, deputy general secretary of the UK-based Musicians\u2019 Union. \u201cI do think the music industry has been slow to recognise that we have a problem,\u201d she says, recalling the 2018 launch of the union\u2019s Safe Space Scheme for harassment and abuse testimony. She remembers that after the Harvey Weinstein revelations in late 2017, \u201cthe music industry as a whole reacted more by saying, \u2018well yeah, sexual harassment happens in all sorts of workplaces.\u201d Akin to a reluctant shrug, an acceptance, rather than a commitment to change the culture.\nKelly\u2019s hits also gave him a Telfon-like coating \u2013 no allegation seemed to stick to him, starting with a civil case brought in 1996 by Tiffany Hawkins who said a 24-year-old Kelly had sex with her while she was 15, under the pretext of advancing her singing career. Her lawsuit named Jive Records and was eventually settled out of court. Lawyers representing Jive successfully argued the label wasn\u2019t liable.\nThis first case exemplified how the apparatus around Kelly worked to insulate him from being seriously questioned. Barry Weiss, Jive chief executive from 1991 to 2011, told the Washington Post that Kelly\u2019s off-stage behaviour was none of the label\u2019s business. \u201cI was a record company putting out R Kelly\u2019s records,\u201d he said, in 2018. \u201cThat was all I knew. I wasn\u2019t involved in his criminal cases. We were a record company, for God\u2019s sakes.\u201d\nLater, when Kelly was acquitted of child abuse images charges in 2008, he seemed untouchable. After that verdict, he continued to release music and tour. He also, according to trial testimony, finessed his system for enlisting and controlling the targets of his abuse. Only the domino effect of Jim DeRogatis\u2019s 2017 reporting for BuzzFeed, the #MuteRKelly movement and January 2019\u2019s Surviving R Kelly documentary finally triggered a criminal investigation and Sony/RCA reportedly \u201ccutting ties\u201d with Kelly.\nBefore then, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Jennifer Hudson, Phoenix and Chance the Rapper were all among artists who collaborated with Kelly post-acquittal, as he entered icon status (Gaga, Phoenix and Chance the Rapper apologised in 2019 for doing so). For what it\u2019s worth, some had spoken out. Rapper Vic Mensa called Kelly a \u201cscumbag\u201d in 2017, and Common, Omarion and Ne-Yo publicly condemned him in the wake of the Surviving R Kelly docuseries (John Legend appeared in the series itself).\nIt\u2019s too early to say how much this first verdict will affect the music industry (Kelly faces other charges in Minnesota and Illinois). Music\u2019s transcendence draws many in, but the structures of its industry leave room for trauma. Pohl outlines this dynamic: \u201cVery much like Harvey Weinstein, it\u2019s a situation where someone holds a lot of power, and then other people entering the industry are more vulnerable because they\u2019re desperate to get a foothold in it. They\u2019re desperate for the fame and fortune that\u2019s promised. And unfortunately, those power imbalances can be abused \u2013 that\u2019s exactly what happened in the R Kelly case.\u201d Sony are yet to publicly respond to the legacy allegations and conviction.\nUntil misogynoir, ingrained sexism and yawning gaps in power are addressed, change will happen slowly. It may have been easy enough for Kelly\u2019s entourage to look the other way \u2013 or, in the case of his former tour manager, bribe an official for the fake ID to allow 27-year-old Kelly to marry a 15-year-old Aaliyah. It may be harder to reshape parts of an interconnected machine that\u2019s run in a particular way for decades.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an artist signed to a record label,\u201d Pohl says, \u201cyour contract will probably deal with what royalties you get, what you agree you\u2019re going to deliver. Is there anything in there about artist welfare, about abuse and harassment? Probably not. Do the workplace policies and procedures cover artists and people who are freelance? Probably not.\u201d That, at least, sounds like a starting point.",

There is this sort of leeway of \u2018oh well it was just a joke or bants or whatever\u2019. It\u2019s then not recorded, and therefore the behaviours increase and get worse,\u201d she said.\nHills, who joined the force in 1991 and became the first female chair of the Black Police Association in 2015, said: \u201cUltimately what needs to happen is for the police to take on board the fact that the problem is within.\u201d\nShe said when she first raised a complaint of sexism when she started out in the force, superior officers failed to take it seriously and instead focused on faults in her work and extended her probation.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest with you, it did knock my confidence by quite a lot. But, again, it\u2019s almost accepted. You accept that this is the way it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of my own experience, it didn\u2019t quiet me but I can see how it has quietened others, in terms of not saying anything and just ducking their heads and getting on with the job in hand.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the ex-Scotland Yard chief superintendent Parm Sandhu said that some female police officers didn\u2019t raise concerns about male colleagues\u2019 behaviour because they feared they would not get support when asking for help, and that they would get \u201ckicked in in the street\u201d, adding that male officers tended to \u201cclose ranks\u201d.\nHills said that while female police officers did fear that colleagues wouldn\u2019t respond to help, she did not believe those fears would materialise. \u201cI don\u2019t think a colleague would stand by and let anyone who is a colleague get assaulted in that way,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they want to get to you, it will be around your performance and that\u2019s where we see a massive disparity.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe fear that if you call for help no one would [help], that is a big fear, but I can\u2019t ever see that happening. It\u2019s definitely a perception.\u201d\nHills went on to criticise the extraordinary advice released by the Met on Friday, which stated people stopped by a lone plainclothes officer should challenge their legitimacy and could try \u201cwaving a bus down\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not sensible. What they need to do is speak to women, find out a consensus and idea of what it feels like to be a female who potentially hasn\u2019t got the lighting on their street or has to go to a park, and what that feels like and what they can then do.\n\u201cYou need to understand the problem before you can then put out a solution and that solution says to me that they still cannot understand the problem.\u201d",

That\u2019s great news for some of us \u2013 but those elsewhere in the country might feel excluded from the feast after getting a virtual place at the table last year.\nHappily, the fest hasn\u2019t forgotten the ground gained in terms of accessibility, and is offering a digital programme of 30-odd features available to stream on the BFI Player \u2013 each for a 24-hour window after its festival premiere \u2013 alongside a programme of free-to-view shorts. It\u2019s a smaller menu than last year\u2019s, but it\u2019s a well curated one: while the presumption at hybrid festivals like this is often that the dregs of the programme are thrown online as a grudging concession, this selection contains a number of the very best films in the lineup.\nTwo of them come from the festival\u2019s main competition. Harry Wootliff\u2019s True Things is a sensual, tingling adult drama that delivers on the promise of her lovely 2019 debut Only You, electrified by remarkable performances from Ruth Wilson, as a frustrated office drone yearning for human connection, and Tom Burke, as the volatile, nameless ex-con who gives her just that, with messy, spiralling consequences. And Iranian film-maker Panah Panahi\u2019s irresistible debut Hit the Road was one of the great discoveries of Cannes this year. Son of leading Iranian auteur Jafar, Panahi Jr shows his own playful, dynamic feel for the medium in this raucous but tender family road movie, which gradually reveals high emotional stakes amid all the antic, dysfunctional comedy.\nOne of the breakout hits of this year\u2019s Sundance festival, winning both the top jury prize and audience award in the international documentary competition, Danish director Jonas Poher Rasmussen\u2019s striking animated doc Flee is presented here in collaboration with the BFI\u2019s LGBTQ Flare festival. Tracing the escape saga of an Afghan-born academic in Denmark, in tandem with his coming-out narrative, it\u2019s an urgent, inventively presented addition to the ranks of refugee stories on film. Also on the documentary side, if you can yet bear to revisit the early days of the pandemic, Oscar-nominated film-maker Matthew Heineman\u2019s The First Wave is a compassionate, heart-in-mouth study of first responders in New York City in the opening months of the crisis.\nOther highlights include Between Two Worlds, an absorbing, morally tricky tale of deception and exploitation, with Juliette Binoche on fine form as a writer posing as a cross-Channel ferry cleaner for the sake of research; the real-time, single-take London restaurant drama Boiling Point, with the great Stephen Graham as a chef on the verge of collapse; Belgian director Laura Wandel\u2019s unnerving, ruthlessly observed debut Playground, in which children\u2019s playtime politics turn breathtakingly cruel; and Ryusuke Hamaguchi\u2019s delightful, bittersweet relationship roundelay Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, one of two great films from the Japanese auteur in this year\u2019s festival. (The other, his immaculate Murakami adaptation Drive My Car, you\u2019ll have to see in cinemas.)\nMy two favourites from the whole selection hail from very different schools of eastern European cinema. The Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov\u2019s mad, swirling dystopian fantasia Petrov\u2019s Flu is a vision of social breakdown in the midst of a flu pandemic that has the imaginative density and mordant poetry of surrealist Russian literature. It\u2019s imposing stuff, however, so chase it with the airier, more joyful Georgian romantic fantasy of What Do We See When We Look at the Sky?, a modern fairytale of chance encounters, love at first sight and football World Cup fever that makes you feel floaty without resorting to magical-realist tweeness. In a larger festival lineup you might overlook it; take advantage of having this beauty brought right to you.\nPig (Amazon/Apple TV) \n  I\u2019ve written about the affectionate, ironic meme-ification of Nicolas Cage as an actor, but his performance in this elegiac, suitably autumnal sort-of-revenge drama is no joke. He\u2019s wonderfully eccentric as a survivalist chef on a determined mission to recover his missing, truffle-sniffing pig, but the film supports him with real humanity.\nThe Truffle Hunters (Amazon) \n How immensely satisfying that this droll documentary and Pig should have been released on to non-premium VOD at the same time: may this new wave of cin\u00e9ma de truffe continue. Following the elderly Italian men \u2013 and their faithful, keen-nosed hounds \u2013 who forage for the elusive white Alba truffle in the forests of Piedmont, it\u2019s amused by their vocation while finding something soothing, even spiritual, in it.\nOliver Sacks: His Own Life (Curzon Home Cinema) \n  The late British neurologist and writer gets a positively glowing bio-documentary, chronicling his troubled childhood, his struggles with his homosexuality and drug addiction, and his pioneering research into autism and neurodiversity. That\u2019s a lot to tackle, and the film just skims the surface of its subject, but it\u2019s brightened by Sacks\u2019s own irresistible presence.\nFree Guy (Disney) \n That this glib, wisecracking riff on The Truman Show for the gamer generation has taken more than \u00a3230m worldwide in cinema has been hailed as a triumph for original storytelling in an era of franchise overload, though Shawn Levy\u2019s film is so patchily assembled from existing plots and tropes that the victory feels a bit hollow. A bit of genuine charm would help.",

I receive frequent questions from you asking if, from a skincare point of view, collagen powders, capsules, jellies and drinks are worth the cash. It\u2019s no wonder the US oral collagen industry\u2019s value is set to double to $8bn (\u00a35.85bn) by 2027.\nCollagen \u2013 simplistically \u2013 is the protein that makes up around three quarters of the dry weight of human skin, helping it to remain firm, supple and plump. It decreases with age (less steadily in smokers and sun worshippers), accelerating sagging and wrinkling. This lost protein is what hydrolysed collagen supplements (animal derived or vegan) promise to replace.\nThere have been lots of credible studies, and some results have been very encouraging, suggesting that oral collagen can reduce lines, slackening, discolouration, even cellulite, in some people. But the variables are endless. We don\u2019t yet know the optimal dose for intake, or even which type of collagen is most effective or for whom.\nSome positive studies have been at least part-funded by collagen brands, and besides, the supplement industry is notoriously unregulated and non-standardised, so no two capsules need be alike. We\u2019re not yet sure how much collagen the body absorbs and retains. There\u2019s little doubt that some collagen-takers will see no improvement and are wasting their money.\nMuch as it\u2019s too early to say whether oral collagen will come good, one could take the approach of a praying agnostic, and ingest as a precautionary measure. Studies suggest overwhelmingly that collagen is safe, and the punt paid off with antioxidant skincare \u2013 now broadly endorsed by cosmetic dermatologists \u2013 after all.\nAs a layperson working within that same community, though, I can observe \u2013 albeit anecdotally \u2013 one stark difference: every expert I know was an early adopter of antioxidant skincare, while very few industry professionals I encounter (myself included) are popping collagen capsules prospectively.\n\nThis article comes from Saturday,\u00a0the new print magazine from the Guardian\u00a0which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI.\nWhat dermatologists generally will hang their lab coats on are the benefits of eating a collagen-rich diet (with plenty of dairy, fish, meat, chicken, soy, tempeh, lentils) and topical retinoids like retinol, clinically proven to inhibit collagen\u2019s breakdown and to stimulate its further production.\nSo if you\u2019re playing the long game with oral collagen, my advice is to avoid the big-ticket supplements. Price is no indicator of quality and gambling is only harmless if losing won\u2019t hurt.",

But that target has been missed. Recently, we saw an OECD report which found that in 2019 only about $80bn was provided.\nThese sorts of sums might sound small compared to what big countries are spending on Covid, but they would make a huge difference to us on the ground. The extreme weather that has been seen around the world in the past year, follows years of hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, droughts and all sorts of damage, which were caused by climate heating \u2013 as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear.\nKeep in mind that this promised climate finance is additional to what developing countries are spending on the climate themselves. An increasing proportion of national budgets are used dealing with the effects of the climate crisis \u2013 such as coping with natural disasters or repairing the damage.\nWe understand that developed countries are busy, putting their own economies back in order after Covid, and that\u2019s why we have not had much progress on climate finance ahead of this Cop. But $100bn is a drop in the ocean, and that figure is not the only story here: the money is not spread evenly.\nThe biggest developing countries take most of the available funds. They can attract funding easily and have the infrastructure and renewable energy projects, such as wind farms and solar, that need investment and make a profit \u2013 which investors like.\nBut for us, who are nano-emitters on a global scale, cutting emissions is not a priority. Adaptation is.\nWhat is worse, a lot of the money is coming in the form of loans, not grants \u2013 about two-thirds of climate finance is loans. This is creating a climate debt trap. We are already in a debt trap because of Covid, and it\u2019s getting worse. How do you expect us to take on more loans, get ourselves even deeper into debt, for something we did not cause in the first place?\nThe UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called for 50% of climate finance to go to adaptation, which would benefit us and ensure that more of the money is spent with the least developed countries, not just the middle-income countries.\nHere\u2019s another idea: developed countries could agree debt-for-adaptation swaps. So instead of developed countries insisting that we repay our current loans in hard currency, which is difficult for us, those repayments could be converted into local currency and spent locally on adaptation. That would boost our economy, save us from having to raise hard currency to repay loans, and make us better able to withstand extreme weather. This idea has been put forward by Germany and we hope other countries will take it up.\nEvery week we\u2019ll hear from negotiators from a developing country that is involved in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations and will be attending the Cop26 climate conference.",

It was reported that Perrottet was previously a voice of agitation internally in favour of eased Covid restrictions earlier in the outbreak, however he is understood to have supported Berejiklian\u2019s roadmaps.\nPerrottet, who is part of the conservative faction of the Liberal party, would require the support of Berejiklian\u2019s moderate faction \u2013 led by the environment minister, Matt Kean.\nThe Liberal party room will meet on Tuesday, however factional players are understood to be counting votes over the long weekend.\nA source familiar with some of the discussions happening within the party told Guardian Australia that candidates and their supporters were frantically phoning fellow politicians on Saturday canvassing support.\nIt appears elements of the party are trying to sort out numbers privately and decide where support will go before being more open about candidates.\nWhile Stokes and Perrottet appear to be the most likely successors, Kean, as well as the minister for tourism and western Sydney, Stuart Ayres, are names being discussed along with transport minster Andrew Constance and attorney-general Mark Speakman.\nStokes \u2013 who has been described as a key ally of Berejiklian \u2013 told reporters outside his home on Saturday that he had been talking to his colleagues about his leadership ambitions and was encouraged by the level of support so far.\nStokes was elected to parliament in 2007 and has also served as minister for environment and transport\n\u201cI think Dom has strong claims to the job and he\u2019s putting them out there ... but I believe I have the qualities necessary to provide strong government into the future,\u201d Stokes told the ABC.\nHe told 7News: \u201cI think I owe it to my community and our to the people in NSW to at least provide them that choice.\u201d\nThe Labor leader, Chris Minns, on Saturday said he expected Berejiklian\u2019s successor to be an MP who had been in crisis cabinet and would not drastically change the state\u2019s roadmap out of Covid restrictions.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a radical departure from the premier \u2013 the current premier of New South Wales\u2019 plan, NSW Labor will have a lot to say about that,\u201d Minns said.\nMinns thanked Berejiklian for her work as premier.\n\u201cI cannot fault her dedication and hard work on behalf of the people of NSW, particularly over the last 15 weeks \u2026 and I\u2019m sure that her dedication on behalf of the people of NSW will not be forgotten,\u201d Minns said.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Berejiklian was a \u201cdear friend\u201d and lauded her \u201cheroic\u201d qualities on Friday.\nSupportive constituents gathered outside her home on Saturday with flowers and balloons in her initials while others stood outside her office with handmade signs reading \u201cWe love Gladys\u201d and \u201cLong live Gladys\u201d.\nThe anti-corruption watchdog says it is investigating whether Berejiklian \u201cexercised public functions\u201d in a position of conflict given her secret five-year relationship with ex-MP Daryl Maguire, revealed at its hearings in late 2020.\nMaguire is accused of abusing his public office between 2012 and 2018.\nBerejiklian said on Friday she had \u201cno option\u201d other than to resign, as she could not temporarily step aside and resume her role after the investigation.\nHer resignation \u201ccould not happen at a worse time\u201d, she said, as the state prepared to leave months of Covid-enforced lockdowns in less than two weeks.\nShe continues to deny any wrongdoing.\n\u201cHistory will demonstrate that I have always executed my duties with the highest degree of integrity for the benefit of the people of NSW, who I have had the privilege to serve,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "From Liverpool to LA, shortages of energy, labour and transport are threatening recovery from Covid\nIt was all going so well. Successful vaccination programmes were driving the post-pandemic recovery of the global economy, stock markets were back at record highs, and prices were rising just enough to make deflation fears a thing of the past.\nBut a supply crunch that initially put a question mark over the availability of luxury cars or whether there would be enough PlayStations under our Christmas trees is instead morphing into a full-blown crisis featuring a shortage of energy, labour and transport from Liverpool to Los Angeles, and from Qingdao to Queensland.\nAll the problems are in one way or another tangled up in the surge of post-pandemic consumer demand, but taken together they threaten what one leading economist calls a \u201cstagflationary wind\u201d that could blow the global economy off course.\nMohamed El-Erian, and adviser to the insurance giant Allianz and president of Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, says this week\u2019s surprise fall in factory output in China was a clear warning that the world economy could slump while prices were still rising quickly, a doomsday double whammy that almost sank the UK in the 1970s.\n\u201cThe supply chain problems are much more persistent than most policymakers expected, although companies are less surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments are having to rethink quickly because the three elements \u2013 supply side, transport, labour \u2013 are coming together to blow a stagflationary wind through the global economy.\u201d\nEnergy shortages are providing the starkest illustration of the problem, with increasing numbers of petrol stations in the UK running out of fuel, and cities in northern China having to ration power and force factories in the world\u2019s number one manufacturing nation to shutter just when pre-Christmas demand is reaching a peak in the west.\nBoth countries have been caught out by not having enough reserves amid a scramble throughout the world for natural gas and for oil, which has almost doubled in price in 12 months to nearly $80 a barrel.\nAlong with ongoing Covid-related restrictions in some large manufacturing countries such as Vietnam, and a well-documented shortage of components such as computer chips, factories are simply not producing enough.\nBritish car production dropped by 27% year on year in August as a lack of semiconductors and led to a big drop in the number of vehicles exported to Australia, the US and China. On Thursday, Volkswagen, Ford and Opel maker Stellantis announced fresh temporary closures in Germany because of the chip problem. Opel is closing a plant until 2022 \u2013 the longest such stoppage so far.\nIn Japan, an index of stocks of finished goods has dropped to levels not even seen in the wake of 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster.\nBut even if they could get their hands on more sources of energy and materials, and factories could make more goods, it would still cost more to ship things. Drewry\u2019s shipping index, which measures the cost of containers, is up 291% compared with a year ago. On some busy routes, such as from China to Europe\u2019s biggest port Rotterdam, the cost of shipping a container has risen sixfold in the past year.\nThe problems don\u2019t end when the goods arrive at a port, with labour shortages presenting a final problem in the increasingly tortuous journey of products to their final destination. A lack of truck drivers in many parts of Europe, partly because of disputes over conditions and partly because of ongoing Covid restrictions, is causing delays.\nFlavio Romero Macau, a supply chain expert at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia, says that massive pent-up consumer demand in the wake of the pandemic has strained the world\u2019s delicately balanced economic ecosystem.\n\u201cConsumers are crazy to buy things because the world is awash with dollars from government stimulus, higher savings and pent-up demand. PlayStations, laptops, phones, gym equipment \u2013 you name it people are trying to buy it,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHigher demand and restricted supply equals inflation: there\u2019s no way out of it. You put all these things together and its a perfect storm.\u201d\nWhile warnings increase about the threat of stagflation, more economists believe central banks might have to move more quickly to raise interest rates if inflation takes hold across the developed world.\nThe Bank of England has flagged that rates could go up next year, and the US Federal Reserve has at last signalled the end of its massive pandemic stimulus plan that could push up the cost of borrowing in 2022.\nNeil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, said the UK and the US were most at risk from overheating into inflation, leading to central bank action.\n\u201cRisks are generally skewed to the upside and there is a real possibility that inflation increases to a much higher rate that would, in time, necessitate a more substantial tightening of policy,\u201d he said.\nA paradigm shift in monetary policy after years of cheap credit could be accompanied by a rebalancing of the global economy as countries seek to shorten supply chains and become more self-sufficient through more autarkist policies, which promote non-reliance on imports. Romero Macau believes many companies could take the chance to move manufacturing away from China, where the supply of cheap labour that launched its economic miracle is drying up, to countries such as Vietnam and Mexico. The latter, he said, has cheaper labour costs than China, making it attractive especially for American companies.\nRichard Flax, the chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Moneyfarm, said the crisis was already prompting a rethink by policymakers and business leaders.\n\u201cLarge corporates and governments are reviewing their supply chains for crucial goods, with a mind towards security of supply as well as cost. We would expect to see supply chains in some sectors shorten as a response to Covid, either via reshoring, or as companies try to diversify their sources of supply.\u201d",

        "content": "British aristocracy flocked here in Victorian times, but artist Fabien Gauthier is inspired more by its medieval buildings and the remnants of the swinging 1970s\nA specialist in trompe l\u2019oeil art and frescoes ancient and modern, Fabien Gauthier has lived in Menton since 1972\nLe Petit Port, on a leafy square next to the harbour, is a great family-run restaurant whose owner, Gaby Santucci, I have known for 40 years. It specialises in local dishes such as courgette flowers stuffed with cod, giant scampi and octopus salad with porcini mushrooms. Being on the border, Menton\u2019s cuisine has a huge Italian influence but we have our own version of Nice\u2019s socca (chickpea pancake) and pan bagnat (a big bread roll filled with tuna, eggs, anchovies and tomato and soaked in olive oil). The streets around art-nouveau food hall Les Halles \u2013 a great place to buy Menton\u2019s fragrant lemons \u2013 are home to street-food joints such as Sini, which sells pichade (tomato and anchovy tart) and barbajuan (chard and ricotta fritters).4 rue du Jonquier\nMenton was a simple fishing village before the British arrived in the 19th century and turned it into a health resort. European aristocracy built huge belle-\u00e9poque palaces overlooking the sea but my inspiration comes from the friezes and artistic decoration on Menton\u2019s older buildings. In the Basilica Saint Michel-Archange, there are some breathtaking trompe l\u2019oeil paintings on the inside of the dome. The one above the Chapelle du Saint-Sacrement is for me the Rolls-Royce of fresco painting.\nMenton is a calm, serene place, where you always feel as if you are on holiday. As an artist, it provides a very visual experience, full of reds, yellows, peach and ochre tones. I feel very attached to the old town. My first art studio was on rue Longue (the original Roman road), which is all ancient staircases, shutters and medieval doorways. At its southern end is Place du Cap, which is surrounded by little bistros with water fountains, and in Place aux Herbes nearby, site of the original market, you can still see the gently sloping stone slabs where traders laid out their vegetables, herbs and fish.\n\nThis article comes from Saturday,\u00a0the new print magazine from the Guardian\u00a0which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI.\nI\u2019ve always preferred English-style botanical gardens, which leave some of the landscape natural and wild. Lord Hanbury built his Giardini Botanici just over the Italian border in Ventimiglia in the 19th century, and a British general created Menton\u2019s Val Rahmeh gardens in the 1920s, but my favourite among Menton\u2019s many gardens is Serre de la Madone, on the road leading up towards Gorbio. Major Lawrence Johnston filled his seven-hectare estate with tropical plants, parrots and wading ibises, all brought back from his travels. Visitors can wander among the magnolias (pictured below), yuccas, giant eucalyptus and a prehistoric-looking Nolina longifolia from Mexico, then climb the stone steps to a citrus grove, lotus pond and dense woodland beyond.74 route de Gorbio\nMenton\u2019s seafront was strung with nightclubs in the 1970s. Mini Pub (it sounds a lot cooler in French) is one of the few survivors \u2013 I know because I used to work there as a barman. With its suede banquettes, soda siphons, framed photographs of Johnny Hallyday and Claude Fran\u00e7ois and poster for Crazy Horse, Mini Pub is a padded-walled fortress of a bygone swinging France. The swing seats on its terrace look out across the marina, quayside and towards the Italian border. The porticoed Esplanade des Sablettes below was built on reclaimed land and is now popular for late-night gatherings, with a transparent lift to sea level, ice-cream parlours and a walkway under the palm trees.51 quai Bonaparte\nJust behind the promenade and within walking distance of the old town, the 17-room Pavillon Imp\u00e9rial hotel is in the former grounds of one of the huge belle-\u00e9poque palaces on the seafront. It has a shady garden, a library and a bar. Doubles from \u20ac57 room-only in October",

        "content": "Once an asset that secured a comfortable retirement, the medallion\u2019s worth has plummeted, leaving drivers financially ruined. Here are some of their stories\nFor more than a century, taxi drivers have transported busy New Yorkers to their jobs, to brunch, or home from a late night out. A symbol of the city made globally famous in countless Hollywood films, the drivers of these yellow cabs are majority immigrants and people of color.\nDriving a New York City cab has been a vital path for immigrants, and their families, to make a decent living. But in recent years all that has changed. Now, many are struggling under the burden of life-altering debt after investing in a taxi medallion.\nA taxi medallion is the physical certificate required to operate a yellow cab. Once seen as a valuable asset that secured a comfortable retirement, the medallion\u2019s worth has plummeted, leaving the thousands of drivers who purchased a medallion in hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and financially ruined.\nAccording to the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA), the average debt owed on medallions by taxi drivers is $600,000.\nThe tumultuous state of the medallion can be traced back to its artificial inflation. In 1937, New York City created the medallion system and placed a limit on the amount of medallions that could be sold, making one rare and valuable. By controlling the supply, demand for owning a medallion soared among taxi drivers who bought into the city\u2019s promise that a medallion would bring them financial stability and a pathway to achieve the proverbial American dream.\nBut the way New Yorkers \u2013 and tourists \u2013 travel around the city has changed, and the medallion has plummeted in value. In 2014, its value had risen to $1m, when those who wanted to finance a medallion were also at the mercy of predatory lenders. Today, the value is about $100,000 and medallion owners are left mired in debt.\nThe medallion\u2019s drop in value is due in part to the overwhelming demand for ride-share services provided by the likes of Uber, Lyft and Via. Unlike taxi drivers, the drivers of these companies are not beholden to strict rules and regulations\nMedallion-owning taxi drivers, or \u201cowner-drivers\u201d, who spoke to the Guardian say it\u2019s another injustice imposed upon them by the city.\nA protest to restructure the medallion debt run by the NYTWA has garnered the support of progressive politicians including Senator Chuck Schumer, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, state senator Jabari Brisport, and state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani.\nWATCH: I rode with @NYTWA cabbie Richard Chow and ally to taxi workers @ZohranKMamdani to highlight the horrific medallion debt crisis and the need for better solutions from @NYCtaxi.Wanton lending and a lack of oversight created this crisis. We must make it right. pic.twitter.com/6mepG32Tv8\nWhile the city has pledged $65m over 30 years to a medallion debt restructuring plan, the NYTWA and its supporters say it\u2019s not enough. The NYTWA proposed its own debt restructuring plan totaling $90m over 30 years, with a city-backed guarantee to reduce all outstanding medallion debt to a maximum of $145,000, payable at $800 a month.\nWhether or not city officials will agree to their pleas remains to be seen, but what is not in doubt is the real hardship being faced by yellow cab drivers and their families. Here are some of their stories. \nDorthy LeConte has a medallion debt of $558,000 but said her broker raised it to over $600,000 after learning the city would restructure taxi payment plans. She pays $2,000 a month on the loan.\nLe Conte, once a maid and then a housekeeper supervisor at the Waldorf Astoria, entered the taxi industry after hearing about her friend\u2019s positive experience with a medallion.\n\u201cI saw a woman driving a cab. Her husband died and left her a medallion. She was telling me how great it was having a medallion,\u201d LeConte said. \u201cShe even said, \u2018Dorthy, if you lose your home, let it go. Hold the medallion because with a medallion, you could have several homes.\u2019\u201d\nLeConte refinanced her home and purchased a taxi medallion in 1989.\nToday, she\u2019s not driving any more since she put her medallion in storage during the pandemic to avoid paying insurance.\n\u201cMy hope is the city restructures the loan,\u201d LeConte said. \u201cI spent hours working to bring food for my kids. They barely see their mom. They say, \u2018Mom, we never see you. You choose your medallion over us. Look what this city did to you.\u2019\u201d\nMD \u201cMuhammad\u201d Islam lives in Jamaica Hills, Queens. His loan is about $800,000 and his monthly payments are $4,000. Islam, a Bangladeshi immigrant who came to US in 2007, started driving a cab in 2009.\n\u201cCity officials, everyone said it\u2019s a good investment. That it\u2019s \u2018better than a stock\u2019,\u201d Islam said. \u201cThey influenced us to buy the medallion. I borrowed money from my friends, relatives.\u201d\nHe said the only thing preventing him from filing from bankruptcy is the amount of time it takes for someone\u2019s credit to clear after declaring bankruptcy.\n\u201cI have a home. I don\u2019t want to destroy my credit line,\u201d Islam said. \u201cIf I file bankruptcy, it will take seven years to clear. It will hurt [my kids], too. I am trying my best to solve the problem and not go bankruptcy.\n\u201cI have loans with two banks. I tried to negotiate with the banks but they are not negotiating with me,\u201d Islam said. \u201cIf the payment is around $700-800, then we can do that.\u201d\nDorina Nitescu moved to Flushing in 1983 from Romania. Her husband, a former taxi driver, died in 2018, but she must still pay the $200,000 loan on his medallion since the broker listed her as a co-debtor.\n\u201cWe purchased this asset 30 years ago,\u201d Nitescu said. \u201cIt was a good investment at that time for our retirement.\u201d\nNow, Nitescu is left with nothing but the medallion and hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Her only way to make money off of the medallion is to buy a car and lease it to a taxi driver, but she said she cannot afford it.\n\u201cWe started paying the loan with the credit card. After [my husband] died, I didn\u2019t have money for the funeral. The broker said, \u2018I want to help you from my heart,\u2019 but he was a big liar. They stole everything from him.\u201d\nOut of desperation, Nitescu and her husband began attending the NYTWA protests for loan reconstruction.\n\u201cMy husband even made all the nice signs from the bedroom. He even cut my sheets and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll replace that,\u2019\u201d Nitescu said. \u201cHe had the passion to do that.\u201c\nToday, Nitescu attends the protests alone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know my direction. I\u2019m in a big mess,\u201d she said. \u201cOn top of this, I have rent. I\u2019m in the last part of my life. I want to fix my life. I feel sorry for myself. We didn\u2019t come here to be rich. Just to make a living. They stole from us.\u201d\nErhan Tuncel, 61, obtained his taxi license in 1998 and purchased his medallion in 1999. His monthly payment was $3,250 but when his balloon expired, the bank raised the monthly payment to $3,800. His total loan amount is $690,000.\n\u201cI told them I couldn\u2019t do it so they came and took the medallion. They foreclosed on it, so I\u2019m not making those payments,\u201d Tuncel said. \u201cIt was a pathway for an immigrant in New York to the middle class and that\u2019s been taken away.\u201d\nMany have found themselves in a situation similar to Tuncel: his income as a taxi driver is not enough to pay off his medallion debt, so his lender seized it. But without his medallion, Tuncel cannot make a living.\n\u201cThe conditions now do not warrant such large payments. We have been pushed to that situation by people in power so we want them to correct the situation.\u201d\nTuncel wants his medallion returned, his loan restructured, and to get back to driving the public.\n\u201cIt would mean getting my life back,\u201d Tuncel said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t our fault. We want the city to realize that and give us back the dignity we deserve.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple ask when you think about it.\u201d",

        "content": "From container ship queues in the US to power cuts in China, the post-Covid pickup in activity is taking a toll\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic eases and national economies emerge from suspended animation, demand for energy, labour and transport has surged. That sudden acceleration is putting a huge strain on the just-in-time, cross-border supply chains that keep factories open and shelves stocked. From Liverpool to Los Angeles, Beijing to Berlin, the world is in the grip of a supply crunch. Here, Guardian correspondents report on how the fallout is affecting six big economies.\nOff the coast of Los Angeles a record-breaking flotilla of container ships is waiting to unload goods. With the holiday season approaching, companies across the US predicting shortages and price rises for everything from artificial Christmas trees and sports goods to Thanksgiving turkeys. Retailers warn that basics including toilet paper could once again be in short supply.\nSome experts predict 80% of the US will be vaccinated against coronavirus by the end of the year, but the pandemic\u2019s impact will last far longer than that as the broken links in the global supply chain continue to drag down the economy.\nLogjams of container ships are only one part of the story. The US is also experiencing a massive labour shortage, especially in the leisure and entertainment sector. There were a record 10m job openings in the US at the end of June. \u201cHelp wanted\u201d signs can be spotted in restaurant windows across the country.\nRepublicans have blamed pandemic-related increases in unemployment benefits for the lack of workers. Those benefits have ended but there is as yet little evidence that the industries hardest hit are gaining enough workers. Low wages have led millions to reconsider their careers during the pandemic, a phenomenon known as the Great Resignation. At the same time, lack of affordable childcare and the continuing closure of some schools has led many people to drop out of the workforce.\nWith coronavirus still a big threat in many of the countries the US relies on for goods, the crisis looks set to continue for some time. \u201cIt is frustrating to acknowledge that getting people vaccinated and getting Delta under control, 18 months later, still remains the most important economic policy that we have,\u201d the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said this week. \u201cIt is also frustrating to see the bottlenecks and supply chain problems not getting better \u2013 in fact, at the margin, apparently getting a little bit worse.\u201d Dominic Rushe in New York\nThe lights are beginning to go out on large parts of China\u2019s economy. The investment banks Nomura and Goldman Sachs have downgraded their forecasts for growth in the world\u2019s No 2 economy in the wake of power cuts that have idled factories and are also extending already long delays at ports.\nElectricity cuts to entire sections of Shenyang, in northern Liaoning province, have meant traffic lights haven\u2019t worked for a week, raising safety fears for the city\u2019s many cyclists. \u201cIt\u2019s quite inconvenient to ride in the dark,\u201d one resident, Zhu Meiying, told the South China Morning Post. \u201cFor people who drive, they have car lights. But for people who ride bicycles it\u2019s quite dangerous. Street lights on some roads have to be kept on because it\u2019s about lives. Right?\u201d\nZhu questioned what the government\u2019s plans were to address the problem. Liaoning province says rationing is the only thing stopping the power grid from collapsing. Some compounds are without power during daylight hours, cutting off water supply and elevators, even in high rises.\nFootage on social media showed a family trapped in an elevator when the power went out, with many commenting that the situation made them feel as if they were living in North Korea. Others described power cuts during visits to hospital.\nIn a since deleted post, one resident of the north-east said their family of three nearly died of carbon monoxide poisoning after power cuts stopped the exhaust fan from working and the family burned coal briquettes to stay warm.\nThe situation has worsened so much that China has asked Russia to increase the amount of electricity it sends to its neighbour via transmission lines that can carry 7bn kilowatt hours a year.\nLauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the independent Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said China had been caught out. \u201cWhen fuel prices started to rise on the back of the global recovery, power plants cut back on coal purchases and have been running down their stocks for months,\u201d she said. \u201cNow this has meant that plants have run out of coal and are reluctant to purchase more as prices have skyrocketed.\u201d Helen Davidson in Taipei\nA 14.3% surge in energy prices in Germany and the knock-on effect on petrol prices (up 20%) and foodstuffs (4.9%) have all contributed to September\u2019s inflation rate rise to 4.1%, the highest in Germany in almost 30 years.\nThis is put down to growing demand, a shortage in supply and a lack of alternative energy sources. There are suspicions that Russia is artificially holding back supplies in order to increase pressure for the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a charge the Kremlin vehemently denies.\nThe Bundesbank predicts inflation will rise to 5% by the year\u2019s end. Driving prices upwards are a lift in the VAT rate, after it was lowered temporarily last year to help businesses cope with the pandemic, as well a rise in CO2 emission tariffs and scarcity of metals, wood and semiconductors.\nDespite full order books, these supply frictions are expected to continue at least until the end of the year and to cost the economy \u20ac40bn, the effect of which will mainly be felt in 2022. GDP of 2.5% is predicted this year, accelerating to 5.1% next year.\nHowever, there has been no talk as yet of a \u201ccrisis\u201d, \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201cpanic\u201d in Germany and while many manufacturers are feeling the pinch from the friction in supply chains, the average consumer, though often facing longer than usual waits for the delivery of luxury goods (furniture, electronic products, cars), is not experiencing empty supermarket shelves.\nThe issues of supply chain problems together with a shortage of workers prompted the carmaker Opel to announce on Thursday that it was temporarily shutting down a plant that produces hybrid vehicles in the city of Eisenach. Employees will be furloughed, until the factory reopens, hopefully sometime next year, \u201csupplies permitting\u201d.\nDespite almost full employment, a longstanding labour shortage \u2013 currently about 400,000 workers a year \u2013 is a big issue, hampering overall economic growth and making itself felt in everyday life, mainly in the care industry, the health sector, skilled manufacturing, IT, engineering, and every skilled craft and trade from plumbers to carpenters.\nThere is a shortage of 60,000 to 80,000 road haulage workers, and economists warn of a demographic crunch, with more people due to go into retirement than are in active employment.\nA growing number of German workers including train drivers, healthcare staff and workers in the motorhome industry have gone on strike in recent weeks, demanding higher pay amid rising inflation, which has raised fears of an inflationary spiral.\nMarcel Fratzscher, of the German Institute for Economic Research, speaking on the broadcaster DLF, said the government could have to intervene on rents. Most German workers do not own their homes. But he described what was happening as a \u201cnormalisation\u201d after the pandemic.\n\u201cMany people in Germany are scared of the future \u2026 but I see this as a luxury problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rise in inflation is a welcome normalisation after the temporary suppression of prices during the pandemic. There is absolutely no reason to panic.\u201d Kate Connolly in Berlin\nAs energy prices soar elsewhere, Russia finds itself in the enviable position of being the world\u2019s largest net oil and gas exporter combined.\nWhile Russian state television has gloated over videos of British drivers queueing for petrol, the Kremlin has told Europeans that the sooner its Nord Stream 2 pipeline is opened, the quicker gas prices will stabilise.\nIt is hard to shock a Russian economy that has done so much to shock itself, unilaterally banning western imports of meat, fruit, vegetables and dairy in 2014. Yet there are shortages: high-end Moscow restaurants say they cannot find high-quality marbled beef \u2013 the good stuff is being exported at higher prices to China \u2013 or octopus from Indonesia, normally brought by container ships.\nFood inflation is at a record 7% annual rate, its highest in five years, an issue the Kremlin did its utmost to keep under wraps before parliamentary elections last month.\nAnd then there is the mysterious cup-of-noodle shortage of 2021. In regional citiessuch as Krasnoyarsk, the popular doshirak dried noodles have disappeared from shelves amid rumours of a factory shutdown, worker shortages or perhaps rising prices of ingredients. Noodle producers and even regional officials have denied a run on ramen even as prices are reportedly rising for the remaining packs of the most popular flavours, spicy beef and chicken.\nAnd hotels and restaurants are reporting a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d shortage of workers, partly due to rising prices and partly due to Russia\u2019s migrant crisis. Construction and agriculture have been hit by a shortage of an estimated 600,000 workers from Central Asia who did many of the hardest jobs but left during the Covid-19 crisis. Andrew Roth in Moscow\nIn the summer, Britain\u2019s recovery was threatened by a \u201cpingdemic\u201d that forced hundreds of thousands of workers to self-isolate after they came into contact with someone with Covid-19.\nOnly weeks after ministers scaled back the test-and-trace system to prevent businesses and public services from closing due to a lack of staff, petrol shortages have again prevented large swathes of the workforce from travelling to the office, school, factory or, in the case of care workers, reaching housebound patients.\nIt is an episode that is rapidly having economic consequences as it overlaps with shortages of lorry drivers and interruptions to global supply chains that have pushed up prices in everything from computer chips to liquified natural gas.\nGovernment critics have blamed a lack of preparation for the consequences of Brexit that have made supply bottlenecks affecting every country that much worse.\nThe economy remains 3.5% smaller than it was before the pandemic hit. Manufacturing, which has boomed as consumers unable to eat out bought things for their homes, has had a better time but still remains about 2.5% smaller than its previous high in 2019.\nA slowdown in activity across all sectors and regions in recent months is expected continue for the rest of the year as persistent shortages of key staff and supplies hinder any plans business might have had to expand going into 2022.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce forecasts that government efforts to encourage business investment will fall and a 2.5% contraction is likely this year.\nConsumers, even those who have massed huge savings over the past 18 months, are also expected to become more circumspect in their shopping habits after a sharp rise in inflation that the Bank of England forecasts will exceed 4% by the end of the year.\nA sudden rise in gas bills caused by an international shortage of supply will only push inflation higher still. Without extra support, many families could see their living standards fall. Phillip Inman in London\nShortages of timber, steel and other materials are causing havoc in Australia\u2019s huge construction industry and builders are struggling to keep up with demand.\nWith house prices rising at their fastest rate since 1989 owing to post-pandemic demand and government stimulus, companies are scrambling to get hold of supplies and prices are said to be \u201cgoing through the roof\u201d.\nAdam Robson, who runs Prekaro, a design and construction business in Gold Coast, Queensland, said delivery times for steel and timber have blown out from four weeks to four or five months amid the supply squeeze.\n\u201cYou used to be able to buy timber off the shelf but you can\u2019t do that any more. A lot of it comes from China and India and we just can\u2019t get enough containers into the ports,\u201d he said.\nAustralia is expected to increase output in its economy by 4% this year, according to the OECD, despite its two most populous states \u2013 New South Wales and Victoria \u2013 being in lengthy lockdowns. The Reserve Bank of Australia said this week that it expected shipping costs and higher wages to push inflation above its target.\nA lack of migrant labour has not helped either, pushing up costs further. \u201cDemand is so high there aren\u2019t enough tradies in the country,\u201d Robson said. \u201cElectricians and chippies now dictate their prices because we can\u2019t even get people in on 451 [migrant worker] visas.\u201d\nIn a sign of how countries could begin to turn away from long global supply chains, the Master Builders Australia group has called on the government to plant an extra 250,000 trees a year to protect the country against timber shortages in the future.\n\u201cThe housing construction industry is the engine room of the Australian economy and it needs a consistent, reliable domestic timber supply,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief executive, Denita Wawn. \u201cAs the timber shortages of the past 18 months have shown, we cannot rely on imports to fill the gap when we have increased construction activity \u2013 we need to act now.\u201d Martin Farrer in Sydney",

Jamie helped me spot and identify birds from the ferry. I have always been fascinated by birds so had my binoculars poised. The first seabirds to appear were puffins, bobbing past us and into the distance. As the breeding season was over, puffins were almost impossible to see from the island, so this was a lucky interaction. The next birds we spotted were guillemots, \u2013 a group of five or six which, like puffins, are part of the auk family (no, not the ones from The Lord of the Rings).\nThen the gannets soared into sight, the largest seabirds in the north Atlantic, with a wingspan of two metres!

Francis feels inevitable pressure to continue the family trade, and, in preparation for his highly anticipated first public performance in town, writes a suite of Dylan-esque tracks about toil and loss. Except the act is an affectation: Francis is, at heart and by temperament, a prog-rock wailer who dreams of playing high-gain, euphoric guitar solos over the swell of a supportive orchestra. When he\u2019s visited by a sympathetic alien being who observes: \u201cYou wear folk like a cheap suit\u201d, Francis swaps his skinny Levi\u2019s for an LED-encrusted catsuit and sets off across the Milky Way to shred for an audience of intergalactic concertgoers.\nThis is true space opera territory \u2013 Ziggy-era Bowie meets The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy \u2013 and far from typical video game subject matter. But then The Artful Escape is not the product of a typical video game-maker, having been conceived and refined by Johnny Galvatron, frontman of Aussie rock band the Galvatrons. You guide Francis, who runs like a stop-motion Super Mario puppet, across Martian landscapes \u2013 snowy vistas filled with glowing mushrooms, Narnia street lamps, pinwheeling star systems. As you bound around and explore, you are free to break into a soaring solo or pinched harmonic at any moment with the tap of an X button. Every now and then you duet with another character, following on-screen prompts, but there\u2019s no pressure to time your button presses against some computational conductor; you can play according to rhythm and taste. No matter what you choose, it\u2019s bound to sound good, as the game quantises and harmonises everything.\nThe Artful Escape is, Galvatron has said, a 17-year-old\u2019s conception of what it is to play in a rock band: musical transcendence meets universal adoration beneath the hot lights. But behind the shimmer, this is a touching tale of how to break free of the creative expectations of others. There is little traditional challenge here, but as a left-field power fantasy, few video games are so immediately stylish or so gratifying.",

The eyes of the world will be on the United Kingdom \u2013 and Scotland in particular \u2013 as leaders come together to address the challenges of climate change.\n\u201cThere is a key role for the Scottish parliament, as with all parliaments, to help create a better, healthier future for us all, and to engage with the people they represent \u2013 especially our young people.\u201d\nSpeaking at Holyrood for the first time since Prince Philip\u2019s death, the Queen added: \u201cToday is also a day when we can celebrate those who have made an extraordinary contribution to the lives of other people in Scotland, locally or nationally during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cIt is often said that it is the people that make a place. And there are few places where this is truer than in Scotland. As we have seen in recent times. We all know of the difficult circumstances that many people have encountered during the last 18 months. However, alongside this have been countless examples of resilience and goodwill.\n\u201cFollowing my grandson\u2019s time as lord high commissioner, Prince William has told me many heartening stories that he heard first-hand of people and communities across Scotland uniting to protect and care for those who are isolated or vulnerable.\u201d\nThe monarch, who has been on her annual break at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, met party and parliamentary leaders in the garden lobby before the ceremony in the debating chamber.\n Responding to the Queen\u2019s speech, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Covid was the biggest crisis to confront the world since the second world war.\n\u201cIt has caused pain and heartbreak, it has exposed and exacerbated the inequalities within our society. But it has also revealed humankind\u2019s boundless capacity for inventiveness, solidarity and love,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd for those of us in public service, it has reminded us that with collective political will, changes that we might previously have thought impossible or just too difficult can indeed be achieved.\n\u201cIn the months ahead, we must take the same urgency and resolve with which we have confronted this pandemic and apply it to the hard work of recovery and renewal, to the task of building a fairer and greener future for this and the generations who come after us.\u201d\nAfterwards, the Queen, Charles and Camilla were due to meet Scots who have been recognised for their contribution to communities during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

You apply for things and never hear back.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s employers might be struggling to fill a record 1 million job vacancies amid the worst labour shortages in a generation \u2013 with a lack of lorry drivers, hospitality staff and other workers vital for the economic reopening. But for millions like Cousin, navigating the jobs market remains tough.\nWith the end of furlough last week, hundreds of thousands of workers are likely to be on a similar journey. Many are expected to drift into early retirement or put off their job search until their sectors recover.\nDespite a gradual fall in recent months as firms scramble to recruit, official figures show unemployment is still almost 200,000 higher than before Covid, standing at more than 1.5 million.\nBeneath the headlines, however, there are many others out of work. More than 8.7 million people across Britain are not captured in the headline unemployment rate, instead ranked as \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d by government statisticians \u2013 a category of joblessness that has swelled by more than 600,000 in the pandemic.\nMost do not want a job, as they may have health conditions, be studying or have taken early retirement. Yet official figures show as many as 1.7 million would like to find work if only they had sufficient opportunities and support. Could this vast potential workforce help fix Britain\u2019s labour market crisis?\n\u201cThis is one of the big untold stories in the labour market right now,\u201d said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. \u201cWhen people ask, \u2018where are all the workers?\u2019, the reality is most of them are still here.\u201d\nRates of economic inactivity soared in the pandemic. People with health conditions chose to shield from the virus rather than look for work; young adults stayed with their parents or enrolled for an extra year of education; and older staff retired early amid the biggest surge in redundancies on record.\nAlthough life is returning to some sense of normality, concerns remain over the coronavirus Delta variant and a difficult winter ahead. A decade of austerity eroding the capacity of Britain\u2019s network of jobcentres, training and benefits systems has not been reversed, while the costs and lack of availability of childcare and adult social care mean entering the workplace is a non-starter for many.\nJulia McNally, a manager at Liverpool in Work, a support scheme run by the local council and the office of metro mayor Steve Rotheram, helps thousands of jobseekers each month. She has seen first-hand how many marginalised people have stopped looking for a job in the past 18 months.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reticence from some people to re-enter the labour market. Obviously there are still issues with the virus, with kids being sent home from school and that upheaval in people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that will start to settle from now on in. But you\u2019ve also got people who\u2019ve re-evaluated their lives and thought: \u2018I\u2019m not doing this any more, I don\u2019t want to work with such bad pay, terms and conditions.\u2019\u201d\nBusiness leaders and employment experts are calling on Rishi Sunak to use his budget this month to raise the funding available for matching jobseekers with vacancies, and to increase government investment in skills and training. Company bosses have called for visa schemes to bring in more migrant workers, although they acknowledge more can be done to recruit domestically.\nSo far, the government has doubled the number of frontline jobcentre staff \u2013 27,000 work coaches have been hired in just eight months \u2013 and launched both the \u00a32.9bn Restart scheme to help more than 1 million people in long-term unemployment, and the \u00a32bn Kickstart scheme to help young people with job placements.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \u201cOur multibillion-pound Plan for Jobs is giving people of all ages the skills, support and experience needed to confidently land that next opportunity, increase their hours or find new work.\u201d\nHowever, experts said much of the investment was simply helping Britain\u2019s job-matching service and training provision keep pace with soaring demand, rather than reversing years of cuts to capacity. Employers also need to do more to help workers.\n\u201cJobcentre Plus does not regularly engage with people with long-term health conditions or with parents. It risks being a claimant monitoring service rather than a public employment service,\u201d said Wilson.\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t all just on government. When firms say they can\u2019t find workers, they usually mean they can\u2019t find people with the recent experience to do something for the pay and shifts they want to offer. They need to be more willing to meet workers halfway.\u201d\nElizabeth Taylor, chief executive of the Employment Related Services Association, which represents jobs and training scheme providers, said there were programmes available but a lack of coordination to get people on to them.\nSince the government launched Kickstart, fewer than 80,000 young people have joined the programme. Yet it was designed to help 250,000 and is due to be removed at the end of December.\nYoung people have been particularly affected by the pandemic, working in sectors such as hospitality and retail, where lockdown hit hardest.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a capacity issue in jobcentres,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the young people aren\u2019t there, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not being identified and referred.\u201d\nFor Caroline Cousin, support finding work came from a scheme called Working Well run by the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham\u2019s combined authority, and the work programme provider Ingeus. \u201cMy confidence was at an all-time low, but they helped to lift me up,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t afford to retire early. I\u2019d never struggled getting a job in the past but was probably naive not realising how bad it was and how picky employers were.\u201d\nWith help from her job coach, and after 14 interviews with numerous companies, she has found work again as a legal secretary at a firm of solicitors in Salford. \u201cI\u2019d say to people, don\u2019t give up. I felt like I\u2019d given up but then I thought, \u2018no, no, no. I\u2019m going to get a job.\u2019 And here I am.\u201d",

Fred lost the ball, then was unable to dispossess Demarai Gray before Luke Shaw, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Raphael Varane all failed to stop possession going to Townsend via Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9.\nSolskj\u00e6r said: \u201cWe did have enough players behind the ball, we made a couple of bad decisions which cost us in those 10 seconds or whatever \u2013 that counterattack worked for them.\n\u201cWe worked [enough players] well enough behind the ball but should have dealt with the danger better. It\u2019s a counterattack they throw at us, we were well enough organised and should have dealt with the situation a lot better.\u201d\nAs in recent matches United often attacked in isolated bursts rather than in concerted fashion. Solskj\u00e6r bemoaned how toothless his players were in attack. \u201cWe had 75% possession. We got hit on one break that cost us and we lacked that cutting edge to get the important second goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get that second goal you need in games like this as Everton can score a goal from nowhere.\u201d\nAfter the equaliser Cristiano Ronaldo, who had started on the substitutes\u2019 bench, was seen clapping and pointing towards where Fernandes took the dead-ball, perhaps indicating that United should not have conceded from a corner.\nSolskj\u00e6r made five changes, with Ronaldo and Paul Pogba demoted to the bench and Martial and Fred among those drafted in.\n\u201cYou make decisions throughout a long, long season and you\u2019ve got to manage the players\u2019 workload,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision was, for me, the correct one. Anthony Martial did well, scored a good goal, Edinson [Cavani, who also came in] needed minutes, he got an hour, could have had a goal, a great cross and a great chance for him. We have to make those decisions sometimes.\u201d\nEverton have 14 points, the same as United. \u201cIt was a great performance,\u201d their manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, said. \u201cThe team was doing really well in defence and on counterattack. I am really pleased with the team, the effort of the players. [We are] missing some important players and still we are performing.\n\u201cThe target is exactly the same, it has to be the next game against West Ham, with the same mentality, commitment and after we will see but for me it is just one [match] at a time.\u201d",

        "content": "Loosely connected characters from a drug dealer to a morgue attendant converge, in ever ickier circles\nThis unapologetically juvenile, but not unentertaining, anthology film parcels together a bunch of vaguely intersecting horror stories, presented as if they were being told by a small town DJ (66.6 on the dial) named Chilly Billy (Corey Taylor). As Billy and his producer/sidekick take calls from listeners on Halloween, the regale their audience with seasonal stories of sick and twisted monsters that come dressed like nightmarish clowns. It\u2019s Tales of the Mayhem You Damn Well Expect, Nay Insist Upon, Given It Has an 18 Certificate.\nIn the first, Kyra (Riley Sutton), a nice little girl dressed like a witch, is deprived of her rightful share of several pounds of sweets when her abusive redneck stepdad (Kevin Wayne) insists she has to stay at home. Fortunately, Kyra has occult graphic skills and can draw monsters and then conjure them to life to protect her. In later segments, the standard horror-movie morality that governs who gets sliced to ribbons or beheaded grows much murkier, with characters who don\u2019t seem to have done much wrong at all being summarily tortured, violated or just made to have a lousy evening out.\nChuck (Michael Aaron Milligan), for instance, is a drug dealer, but one who gives a lot of his product away for free. It\u2019s hard to work out how he deserves to be mauled by Bad Candy, the evil clown killer of the title. Likewise, poor Abbie (Haley Leary, one of the better actors here, though the competition isn\u2019t fierce), a lovelorn morgue attendant, drops one of Chuck\u2019s acid tabs and does a little necrophiliac partying with a corpse. Does that mean she deserves to end up locked in a freezer with a horde of leering zombies towards the end of her segment? And if you\u2019re up in arms about the plot of the mini episodes being spoiled, then you really should be getting a life. Here\u2019s a really big spoiler: pretty much everyone dies. Happy Halloween.\n Bad Candy is released on 4 October on digital platforms.",

        "content": "Where Rafael Ben\u00edtez has built a team greater than the sum of its parts, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r lacks a coherent plan\nLewis Dobbin and Charlie Whitaker were veterans of a combined total of one minute\u2019s senior football for Everton. They were the attacking options on Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s bench. Their Manchester United counterparts were Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and the lesser-spotted Donny van de Beek, whose \u00a335m fee made him \u00a335m costlier than Andros Townsend, who earned Everton a point.\nDobbin was Everton\u2019s second substitute. In a sense, that rendered him their Ronaldo, even if 790 career goals separate them. The comparisons may end there, and Whitaker remained on the bench with the 37-year-old third-choice goalkeeper Andy Lonergan, making up the numbers as an ambush was expertly executed by the last men standing. Or, in the case of the relentless Townsend and Demarai Gray, the last running. Strength in depth for United could not overcome a formidable gameplan. Gray, signed for \u00a31.7m, was the finest player on show. Austerity has been the mother of reinvention for Everton.\nBut if analysis by transfer fee alone can be reductive, the salient point is that Ben\u00edtez has constructed a team more than the sum of its parts, some acquired on the cheap, thrust together by circumstances, working with a determination to make Evertonians proud. So did Dean Smith and David Moyes when Aston Villa and West Ham won at Old Trafford in the space of four days with what are, in essence, ambitious mid-table clubs. So, for that matter, did David Wagner when Switzerland\u2019s Young Boys beat United. Each has been an advertisement for coaching and strategy.\nAll of which scarcely casts Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r in a good light when those teams display the traits his are increasingly lacking, when they overachieve while he underachieves. The Norwegian may feel luckless, entering the stage where players get credit for victories while he is blamed for setbacks. If that reflects United\u2019s reliance on individual inspiration to compensate for the absence of anything more coherent, it is worth noting that his surprise selection scored. Solskj\u00e6r had not taken the popular route by picking Anthony Martial; he had disappointed the majority by letting Ronaldo spend the first 55 minutes rivalling Usain Bolt for the title of the most decorated and celebrated spectator at Old Trafford. The result suggests the bold gambit of resting Ronaldo backfired.\nSolskj\u00e6r perhaps had too many options, Ben\u00edtez too few. Yet in midfield United are in a strange state where, despite a superstar-studded forward line, they cannot seem to live with Fred or without him. They had been utterly unconvincing against Villarreal when he was dropped, with a void where a midfield was supposed to be. On his recall, Fred showed more purpose in possession and crossed when Edinson Cavani probably should have scored. And yet the abiding image of his afternoon was when the outstanding Gray outmuscled Fred to surge away and, along with Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, set up Townsend for his equaliser. Gray, the winger used in the middle, exploited United\u2019s lack of a high-class defensive midfielder to counterattack with menace. Townsend has proved unexpectedly prolific \u2013 Ronaldo is not the only summer signing to have five goals already.\nPotential is being realised, just not at Old Trafford. Even as he ended a seven-month drought, United\u2019s scorer feels a case in point. \u201cTony Martial scores again,\u201d sang the Stretford End. The sarcasm was as audible as the anglicised pronunciation. Again? Martial\u2019s previous goal for United was the eighth in the 9-0 defeat of Southampton in February, helping to forge a record-equalling feat but otherwise an irrelevance.\nAs the United faithful had already summoned their tributes to Solskj\u00e6r from their songbook, perhaps the soundtrack came from the past. Paco Alc\u00e1cer, Edin Dzeko, Roberto Firmino and Dominic Calvert-Lewin had scored at Old Trafford in a No 9 shirt since Martial had. Then came the sort of finish that, even if it took a slight deflection, brought back memories of his debut goal in 2015, a speedster sweeping in from the left to provide echoes of Thierry Henry. Yet in the intervening period, the clause compelling United to pay Monaco more if he wins the Ballon d\u2019Or has looked ever more of a curious irrelevance.\nMartial has begun to look a candidate for exile. Younger, quick alternatives have overtaken him: Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Sancho. Older figures from prehistoric times, such as Ronaldo and Cavani, have left him trapped between the generations. The chances are that the footballer United\u2019s squad voted their player of the year in 2019-20 ranks in no one\u2019s first-choice side but he still possesses quality.\nBut the problem with having such options is the difficulty in selecting the right ones. Solskj\u00e6r may have been vindicated by a starter, but his deluxe replacements \u2013 Ronaldo, Sancho and Pogba \u2013 could not provide a winner. Even when the manager got something right, rather more went wrong. And if that is a microcosm of his season, it bodes badly.",

        "content": "At the seventh attempt this season Leeds banished any growing self doubt by winning a Premier League game.\nAdmittedly they will face infinitely more awkward opponents than Watford and there remains a certain fragility about some of their play, but with Dan James finding his feet on the left wing and Diego Llorente restoring order to defence, optimism just about eclipsed pessimism at Elland Road.\n\u201cOf course I feel relief,\u201d said Marcelo Bielsa. \u201cWe should have scored more goals but we defended well. The result was never in danger.\u201d\nThere was somewhat less satisfaction in the Watford camp with their goalkeeper, Ben Foster, pulling no punches. \u201cWe were very poor,\u201d he said Foster.\n\u201cIf we\u2019d equalised it would have papered over the cracks. Leeds were very sharp and worked their socks off but we didn\u2019t have a shot on target. We can\u2019t expect to come away with anything.\u201d\nLlorente\u2019s return to central defence after injury not only offered Leeds reassuring stability but a source of stellar distribution from the back. The Spain international\u2019s passing represented a key reason why Watford quickly found themselves on the ropes and it was thoroughly appropriate he scored the 18th-minute winner.\nIt arrived when Raphinha\u2019s corner ricocheted off Juraj Kucka and Llorente\u2019s sharp reactions enabled him to hook a volley beyond Foster.\nThe overwhelming Elland Road consensus was that shortly afterwards Leeds were denied a penalty when Simon Hooper turned a blind eye when William Troost-Ekong extended an arm and hauled James back in the area.\nNo matter; the good news for Leeds was that James enjoyed his best game since arriving for \u00a325m from Manchester United. He seems to have finally got the hang of his new manager\u2019s high-speed, high-intensity, high-pressing, game and his enthusiastic contribution to it at times left Watford looking as if they were running on empty. Their defence could certainly have done without James\u2019s disorientating change of pace.\nIf Danny Rose had been looking forward to his first competitive return in a club fixture since leaving Leeds in 2007, he surely had a change of heart after struggling to subdue Raphinha and the impressive right-back, Jamie Shackleton.\nLeeds, though, are traditionally generous hosts and when Llorente made a rare error, Ozan Tufan had the underworked Illan Meslier to beat but, miscuing, skied his shot over the bar.\nAs the second half unfolded Xisco Mu\u00f1oz adjusted his formation from 4-2-3-1 to, theoretically at least, an attack-minded 4-2-4 and, for a few seconds, he thought Watford had equalised when Meslier uncharacteristically dropped a routine ball and watched in horror as it trickled over the line.\nFortunately for the Frenchman, the referee had already blown for Christian Kabasele\u2019s perceived foul on Cooper. \u201cIf that goal had been given it would have been unjust to the overall picture,\u201d said Foster.\nAfter long periods of almost blanket Leeds dominance, an equaliser would certainly have been a bit of a travesty but their inability to conjure a second goal dictated that an element of fear lingered in the cool, damp October air until the high-decibel eruption of joy at the final whistle.\nGranted, Tyler Roberts\u2019s late shot was cleared off the line by Kucka and then hit the underside of the bar but Bielsa must be hoping Patrick Bamford returns from injury after the international break wearing his shooting boots.\nGiven the hire and fire habits of the Pozzo family, Watford\u2019s notoriously trigger-happy owners, Mu\u00f1oz will presumably be happy to simply survive the next fortnight. \u201cI\u2019m sad and disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to win games we need better performances. It\u2019s important to change the situation.\u201d",

        "content": "Stamford Bridge had become an anxious place by the time Thomas Tuchel readied his final change in the 83rd minute. The doubts were starting to build. Under pressure after those limp defeats to Manchester City and Juventus, Chelsea were looking frazzled after allowing this game to spiral out of control, and it was hard to see where a winner was coming from when Tuchel turned to one of England\u2019s forgotten men, telling Ross Barkley to come on instead of Kai Havertz or Hakim Ziyech.\nAt that stage, with Southampton\u2019s 10 men clinging on for a point after James Ward-Prowse\u2019s red card, nobody could have predicted what was to come.\nNobody imagined that those dramatic final minutes would feature Barkley making an instant impact moments after replacing Ruben Loftus-Cheek or, even more improbably, Timo Werner finally getting the better of VAR by scoring the goal that lifted Chelsea into first place.\nWerner must have wondered when his luck would turn. The German has had 16 goals disallowed since joining Chelsea for \u00a347m two summers ago \u2013 the latest one arrived shortly before half-time here \u2013 and his head could have dropped. Yet Werner has become a cult favourite with the Stamford Bridge faithful and nobody could begrudge him his moment when he restored Chelsea\u2019s lead with six minutes left, converting C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s cross after Barkley had opened Southampton up.\nThe moral of the story: never give up. Chelsea kept plugging away and there was more to come after Werner\u2019s first league goal since April, Ben Chilwell adding gloss to the scoreline when he atoned for his part in Southampton\u2019s equaliser by making it 3-1.\nChilwell\u2019s goal left Southampton, who are a point above the bottom three, with nothing to show from a spirited display. They had threatened to snatch their first win of the season after levelling through Ward-Prowse\u2019s penalty. \u201cWe played a brave game,\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cThe red card changed everything.\u201d\nHasenh\u00fcttl did not offer a view on Ward-Prowse\u2019s dismissal for fouling Jorginho after 77 minutes. He was more disappointed that his side could not hold out. Southampton had Chelsea worried; Tuchel, never the calmest of characters, had even been booked after taking his protests too far after Werner\u2019s disallowed goal.\nTuchel was even more animated than usual. The German wanted aggression from the first whistle and he raced out of his technical area to rip into Chilwell early on, hammering the left wing-back for failing to read a pass from Callum Hudson-Odoi.\nChelsea had to respond after some choked displays. Tuchel made five changes after the defeat to Juventus and his lineup pleasingly featured three academy products. Loftus-Cheek was impressive in midfield, Trevoh Chalobah dropped into the right side of the back three and there was finally a chance for Hudson-Odoi to impress on the left wing.\nHudson-Odoi had a good battle with Tino Livramento, who left Chelsea in search of games in the summer, and he thought that he had an assist when his cross was headed in by Werner, only for VAR to find a foul on Kyle Walker-Peters by Azpilicueta.\nTuchel was livid when he realised that his side had not doubled their lead, although the eruption felt over the top. Chelsea had been in control since going ahead in the ninth minute, Loftus-Cheek flicking on Chilwell\u2019s corner for Chalobah to tap home at the far post.\nSouthampton were fortunate not to fall further behind. Chilwell, making his first start in the league this season, was thwarted by Alex McCarthy. Antonio R\u00fcdiger later released Romelu Lukaku, who was denied his first goal in five games by a tight offside call.\nYet there were flickers from Southampton. Adam Armstrong saw a deflected shot saved by \u00c9douard Mendy, Theo Walcott headed wide and the visitors improved after half-time, the introduction of Ibrahima Diallo giving them more solidity in midfield.\nChelsea dropped back and Livramento, showing why he was so highly rated at Cobham, won a penalty when his driving run drew a rusty challenge from Chilwell. Martin Atkinson pointed to the spot and Ward-Prowse drew Southampton level, calmly sending Mendy the wrong way.\nNow it was a proper contest. Mason Mount came on, increasing the tempo for Chelsea. Chilwell and Werner both went close and there was another twist when Ward-Prowse brought his studs down on Jorginho\u2019s ankle. Atkinson checked the pitchside monitor and dismissed Southampton\u2019s captain.\nSouthampton\u2019s momentum drained away. Tuchel replaced Mateo Kovacic with Jorginho and there were a few raised eyebrows when he introduced Barkley.\nYet the changes worked. Barkley, whose Chelsea career looked over after a disappointing loan spell at Aston Villa last season, immediately lifted a glorious pass over to the right for Azpilicueta, who crossed for Werner to score from six yards.\nSouthampton were beaten. Five minutes later a goalmouth scramble involving near misses from Lukaku and Azpilicueta ended with Chilwell\u2019s rising shot just creeping over the line before McCarthy clawed it out. Chelsea\u2019s redemption was complete.",

        "content": "Restrictions are on track to ease before England arrive but pandemic has shown how quickly things can change\nThis Sunday, Australia starts daylight saving. Or some of Australia. New South Wales and Victoria will join Tasmania in setting east-coast clocks forward. Queensland on the same coast will stubbornly stay on standard time for reasons lost in the dim mists of history. Formerly half an hour behind that lot, South Australia will skip half an hour ahead of Queensland. The Northern Territory will not, dropping from 30 to 90 minutes behind Sydney. Western Australia will go from two hours behind the east to three. Then there\u2019s the small town of Eucla halfway between Adelaide and Perth, which runs on Australian Central Western Standard Time \u2013 8 hours and 45 minutes ahead of Greenwich.\nIf you think that is confusing, try Australian states and Covid regulations. Since last year the eight provincial governments across the country have constantly shifted restrictions and enforcement about travel and quarantine as outbreaks are suppressed in one place or flare up in another. Parochialism and public health are each factors. A federal vaccine program defined mostly by its absence has maintained that necessity. Where politicians elsewhere speak in blas\u00e9 style about living with the virus, much of Australia still has the luxury of living without it.\nWhich makes the prospect of a nationwide Ashes tour daunting for the England players and staff weighing it up. It is counterintuitive that people from a country smothered in the virus should be anxious about travelling somewhere that is not , but the double-jabbed ranks of the autumn tourists can by now live a mostly unencumbered life at home. Travelling to or around Australia at present offers far less certainty.\nTake the snap decision during the week for the Tasmanian state team to drop a match in Brisbane and fly home after four Covid cases were logged in a city that previously had none. It was not that the Tasmanians were paranoid about being infected, but that their own state could without notice close the border and require them to spend two weeks in quarantine before getting home. It was not worth the risk.\nNew South Wales and Victoria are comparatively riddled with the virus, with residents banned from travelling elsewhere besides a few essential exceptions. Half a dozen of Argentina\u2019s rugby players found this out the hard way, after a day trip from Brisbane over the New South Wales border that ended in detainment when they tried to drive back for today\u2019s match against the Wallabies. The Australian Football League grand final, contracted to be played each year at the Melbourne Cricket Ground until past the middle of this century, was moved to Perth so that a live crowd could attend the climax of the Australian rules season.\nThe rest of the states are open to one another, but that can change, and repeatedly have done, overnight. Queensland continues to record a couple of cases per day, which could swiftly become many more. And Queensland is where the England retinue is due to make landfall. There is little comfort for the tourists that after their initial quarantine to enter the country, they may be lumped with another stretch to move between states.\nBut, as Australia\u2019s Test captain, Tim Paine, noted to some demur, the Ashes will go ahead regardless of which players decide to tour. The boards of Australia and England look after one another as reliably as they disregard anyone else but India, and there is too much money on the line for either to mess with the schedule. If the ECB has to send the Grimsby Town first XI, then so be it.\nThe good news for those England players is that the situation and restrictions are on track to ease before they arrive. As of the last day of September, Australia had passed 54% of people fully vaccinated nationwide, and is on track for 80% by early November. On Friday the federal government announced approval for states reaching that threshold to resume international arrivals for vaccinated travellers with one week of home quarantine rather than two weeks in hotels. There is also a plan for Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia to open travel between themselves once the threshold is reached.\nWhich means the likely England schedule will involve arriving in Queensland at a quarantine resort with training permissions agreed by that state government, spending perhaps half as long in isolation as anticipated, starting off at the Gabba, then being free to travel to Tests in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.\nThe Western Australian government has been the country\u2019s strictest throughout the pandemic, and shows no signs of changing, but the result won\u2019t be to ask players for extra quarantine to enter the state, it will be to excise Perth from the itinerary. Having lodged a solitary Ashes win there back in 1978, few England cricketers will mourn that. If terms can be reached with Tasmania, then Hobart is a possible replacement. If not, Canberra recently hosted its first Test match and would jump at the chance.\nNone of which looks too onerous. In some ways, we are existing in a dual reality: the tour conditions that have to be agreed on now, between the two boards and the England players, have to assume that current restrictions will still be in place. The new laws do not yet exist. And yet it is all but certain that things will be different by late November. England\u2019s concerns date a few weeks ago, and were valid then. But if the pandemic era has shown us one thing, it is how quickly anything can change.",

        "content": "From fast food to farming, Covid-19 has accelerated the rise of the worker robots. This in turn will put more jobs at risk and makes the need to reframe society ever more urgent\nAs the coronavirus pandemic enveloped the world last year, businesses increasingly turned to automation in order to address rapidly changing conditions. Floor-cleaning and microbe-zapping disinfecting robots were introduced in hospitals, supermarkets and other environments. Some enterprises found that, given the new emphasis on hygiene and social distancing, robotic operations offered a marketing advantage. The American fast food chain White Castle began using hamburger-cooking robots in an effort to create \u201can avenue for reduced human contact with food during the cooking process\u201d.\nWith the worst days of the pandemic hopefully now behind us, the jobs story has turned out to be unexpectedly complicated. While overall unemployment rates remain elevated, both the US and the UK are experiencing widespread worker shortages, focused especially in those occupations that tend to offer gruelling work conditions and relatively low pay. Even as a quarter of a million of British workers who held jobs in 2019 remain unemployed, job vacancies are up 20% from pre-pandemic levels as employers struggle to fill many positions. The reasons behind the worker shortages are not entirely clear. A common assumption is that extended payments to furloughed workers allowed people to remain out of the workforce. However, evidence from a number of US states that moved to discontinue unemployment benefits early suggests that the extended payments may not have played a major role. Many workers may have simply reassessed their willingness to do difficult and often unrewarding jobs in return for low pay. In the UK, Brexit has greatly exacerbated the situation. At least 200,000 EU nationals, primarily from eastern Europe, who once filled roles in areas such as agriculture, transportation and logistics, have left the country and may never return.\nAll of this has created a powerful incentive for businesses to invest in automation as a way to adapt to the worker shortage. As British farms confront the absence of seasonal workers who once flooded in from eastern Europe, interest in agricultural robots is growing. The UK-based startup Small Robot Company, for example, has developed two robots capable of killing weeds in wheat fields while cutting down dramatically on the use of chemical pesticides. The first robot autonomously prowls a wheat field, and with precision and patience that no human could match analyses each individual wheat plant using several cameras, mapping the exact locations where weeds are beginning to encroach. Once this data has been collected, a second, somewhat frightening, five-armed robot follows, killing the weeds by administering a powerful electric shock.\nAnother startup company, Xihelm, which received venture funding from the UK government in 2018, has built a robot capable of harvesting fragile fruits and vegetables in greenhouses. The robot can, for example, carefully pick tomatoes after using artificial intelligence to identify only the ripest fruit. In the US, where the worker shortage has hit the restaurant industry especially hard, the White Castle chain has introduced french fry automation to work alongside its new hamburger robots, while the national restaurant chain Sweetgreen acquired a startup company that provides robotic kitchen technology. McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the Chicago area are experimenting with an artificial intelligence-powered voice system that can process customer orders in drive-throughs.\nThere can be no doubt that the pandemic and the associated worker shortage are accelerating the drive toward deploying artificial intelligence, robotics and other forms of automation. In the UK, the trend is being further amplified as Brexit\u2019s impact on the workforce becomes evident. However, the reality is that most of these technologies are unlikely to arrive in time to offer a solution to the immediate challenges faced by employers. Xihelm\u2019s tomato-picking robot, for example, remains in the testing phase; the machines are not yet generally available for purchase. Some of the most critical worker shortages the UK are in transportation and logistics. By one estimate, the country is currently short of at least 100,000 truck drivers. As has been widely publicised, this has led to shortages of everything from petrol to McDonald\u2019s milkshakes. No robots will be coming to the rescue in the near future. While a number of startup companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are working on self-driving trucks, the technology remains at several years away from commercial viability. Add time for governments to craft the necessary regulations or simply to get the public to accept the idea of fully loaded trucks navigating local roads without a driver at the wheel and the wait could easily be much longer.\nOver the course of a decade or more, however, the overall impact of artificial intelligence and robotics on the job market is likely to be significant and in some specific areas the technologies may lead to dramatic change within the next few years. And many workers will soon confront the reality that the encroachment of automation technology will not be limited to the often low-paying and less desirable occupations where worker shortages are currently concentrated. Indeed, many of the jobs that employers are struggling to fill may prove to be highly resistant to automation. At the same time, better-paying positions that workers definitely want to retain will be squarely in the sights as AI and robotics continue their relentless advance.\nConsider, for example, the distribution centres run by Amazon or the online grocery retailer Ocado. As online shopping has accelerated, these warehouses have become an employment bright spot, providing jobs for many thousands of workers. Less than a decade ago, facilities of this kind would have been animated by hundreds of workers continuously roving between tall shelves containing thousands of different items. The workers would have included \u201cstowers\u201d tasked with taking newly arrived inventory and storing it on shelves and \u201cpickers\u201d responsible for retrieving items in order to fulfil customer orders. The activity would have been a continuous mad scramble, perhaps resembling an especially disordered anthill, in which a typical worker might trek a dozen or more miles over the course of a single shift.\nIn today\u2019s most advanced distribution centres, this bustling motion has become almost a mirror image of itself. It is now the workers who remain stationary \u2013 doing the picking and stowing \u2013 while the inventory shelves speed about, conveyed between destinations by fully autonomous robots. Amazon now operates more than 200,000 of these robots at its distribution centres worldwide, while Ocado employs more than 1,000 at a single facility in Andover in Hampshire.\nCompanies such as Amazon and Ocado continue to employ massive human workforces largely because the robots are \u2013 so far \u2013 unable to perform the picking and stowing operations that require human-level visual perception and dexterity. This is certain to change, however. Both companies, as well as number of well-funded startups, are working on building more dexterous robots. Indeed, Amazon\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, speaking at a conference in 2019, said: \u201cI think [robotic] grasping is going to be a solved problem in the next 10 years.\u201d In other words, a great many of the hundreds of thousands of workers now employed in these facilities are likely to become redundant in the relatively near future. And as robots advance, they will likewise be deployed ever more frequently in restaurants, supermarkets and other environments.\nMore educated white-collar workers will quickly discover that they are by no means exempt from the rise of AI. Any job that involves the relatively routine analysis or manipulation of information is likely to fall in whole or in part to software automation. Some of the world\u2019s largest media organisations, for example, already use AI systems that automatically generate news articles, while intelligent legal algorithms analyse contracts and predict the outcome of litigation. AI is even beginning to demonstrate a talent for routine computer programming. In many cases, knowledge work will prove to be easier and less expensive to automate than lower-paid work that requires physical manipulation. When the job is focused purely on working with information, there is no requirement for an expensive mechanical robot and no need to surmount the difficult technical challenges involved in replicating human dexterity or mobility.\nIn the long run, as advancing technology shapes our post-pandemic future, the workforce will increasingly be divided into winners and losers. The losers will be those who focus largely on routine, predictable tasks, regardless of whether these activities are physical or intellectual in nature, and often independent of education level. The winners are likely to fall into one of three general groups. First, skilled trade workers, such as plumbers and electricians, who do work that requires dexterity, mobility and problem-solving ability in highly unpredictable settings. The same is true for a care worker who assists an elderly person with his or her daily needs. This type of work is far beyond the capability of any existing robot and these jobs will remain safe for the foreseeable future. Second, those workers whose occupations require the development of deep, sophisticated relationships with other people will be relatively safe. This might include caring roles, such as nursing, or business or educational occupations that require complex human interactions. While AI is making progress in this arena \u2013 for example, there are already chatbots that can provide rudimentary mental health support \u2013 it is likely to be a long time before machines can form truly meaningful relationships with humans. The final category includes intellectual work that is creative or activities that are otherwise genuinely non-routine and unpredictable in nature. For these workers, artificial intelligence will be likely to amplify, rather than replace, their efforts. Within many professions, a winner-take-all scenario might unfold; the most creative individuals will rise to the top, while those focused on more routine activities will face a growing threat from automation.\nThe best advice for individuals is to transition from routine, predictable work and towards one of these winning categories. There are real questions, however, about the viability of this advice when applied to society as a whole. Historically, advancing technology has tended to drive most workers from routine work in one sector to routine work in another. As agriculture became mechanised, workers moved from farms to factories, but they continued to do routine work. Later, workers moved to routine jobs in the service sector. The rise of artificial intelligence will require an unprecedented transition in which a large fraction of the workforce will have to find and adapt to roles that are genuinely non-routine. It is unclear whether a sufficient number of these jobs will be created \u2013 and, even if they are, many workers will likely lack the inherent talents and personality traits required to take on creative or relationship-based roles.\nDesigning a society that can adapt to the rise of artificial intelligence and allow everyone to thrive as these changes unfold is likely to be one of our most significant challenges in the coming years and decades. It will require an emphasis on retraining and education for those workers who can realistically undertake the necessary transition, as well as an improved safety net \u2013 and perhaps an entirely new social contract \u2013 for those who will inevitably be left behind.\nMartin Ford is the author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything, published on 30 September (Basic Books, \u00a320).

There\u2019s no point in me saying it\u2019s been a crap week for women. It feels like it\u2019s always a crap week for women.\u201d\nHayes added that she hoped to raise son, Harry, to be respectful of women. \u201cAll of us hope for a place where we feel safe. To go to work, walk the streets, live our lives without threat and fear, and that\u2019s not about what\u2019s gone on in America, that\u2019s in general,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a better place for women as we all do but it starts at home. My job is about educating my son to make sure he understands the importance of women and how to not take advantage of us.\n\u201cI want my son to grow up knowing that he is to respect women and to understand that when a woman says no she means no. He will grow up, I hope, to be a young man who doesn\u2019t exploit the sexual differences between us.\u201d\nThe Brighton manager, Hope Powell, said that while she did not know the players involved in the allegations in the US she is \u201cso pleased they spoke up\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that these things happen, not just our sport but in any sport, and now it\u2019s about making sure players are protected and making sure cases like this never happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people who feel they aren\u2019t treated right find their voice and there is a safe space for them to say what they feel is wrong and I\u2019m just thankful that people have listened.\u201d\nPowell, like Hayes, added of the circumstances of Everard\u2019s murder: \u201cA person that you think is there to protect you becomes the perpetrator, it\u2019s really sad.

        "content": "Score early and Manchester City can be devastating \u2013 but they often lose heart if their rivals strike first\nThe temptation watching Manchester City\u2019s 1-0 win at Chelsea last Saturday was to think we were witnessing the very best of modern football. It might not have been rip-roaring, but here were two squads stocked with exceptional talent, guided by exceptional managers, engaged in a great cerebral tussle. Chelsea had won the previous three meetings, but this time in the Premier League they were stifled by the perfectly executed press of City. It all felt thrillingly high-level. And then came defeats for both sides in the Champions League.\nThat may not be hugely consequential. Both made changes for difficult away trips in Europe, and both can be confident of making the last 16 despite the setbacks. But still, the defeats demand a resetting of perspective. Last Saturday, City pressed perhaps as efficiently as any side has in the Premier League, and looked like a team about to embark on one of those remorseless unbeaten runs that have decided recent titles. But Tuesday\u2019s defeat in Paris highlighted one statistic in particular: in five games away from the Etihad this season (including the Community Shield), City have scored only twice.\nThe obvious response is that City might have been rather more productive had they only signed Harry Kane in the summer. But to suggest that City need a striker is probably oversimplistic. After all, they have twice scored six once and twice scored five in home games this season (as well as being held to a 0-0 draw by Southampton). It\u2019s not as straightforward as a lack of goals.\nRather, City\u2019s problem this season is that it\u2019s been either all or nothing: if they get ahead they can devastate opponents, but there is also a sense that if an early goal doesn\u2019t arrive, opponents can thwart them, which was a problem for Guardiola in his final season at Barcelona, and was probably as much psychological as tactical.\nOf course it is true that a bona fide striker \u2013 a Cristiano Ronaldo, say \u2013 can burgle goals from nowhere to turn defeats into draws or draws into wins. At the Parc des Princes on Tuesday, as City regularly found themselves with comfortable possession in the great rift valley between Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s front three and their back seven, it was easy to imagine how they might have prospered with a striker at whom they could aim crosses.\nBut City were top scorers in winning the league last season and reached the Champions League final when their only real striker was Sergio Ag\u00fcero, whose involvement was limited to seven league starts. Guardiola prospered at Bayern with a striker in Robert Lewandowski, but he is a particularly mobile forward with no qualms about fulfilling his defensive responsibilities. Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s season at Barcelona was a failure in part because of a personality clash with Guardiola, but also because he was too static to fit the system.\nSamuel Eto\u2019o and David Villa were far more effective, largely because they were willing to sacrifice themselves for the side, often playing wide to allow Lionel Messi through the middle. The positional game Guardiola favours probably functions best, and the control he demands in games is probably best achieved, with a false 9 \u2013 even if that can at times slightly blunt the tip of the side to strengthen it in other areas.\nBut that still leaves the fundamental question of what has changed from last season. Jack Grealish has played in all six league and both Champions League games since arriving in the summer. He has not yet been an outstanding success, but neither has he struggled especially, even if a clear sense that he is finding his feet remains. That is only natural; it probably took Riyad Mahrez a year to discover his best form under Guardiola.\nAfter Grealish\u2019s impressive display against Chelsea \u2013 eight successful pressures and six shooting chances created were more than any other City player \u2013 he was a frustrating and frustrated figure in Paris. Although he wasn\u2019t helped by the referee Felix Brych\u2019s curious reluctance to admit the notion that he could be fouled, he repeatedly turned inside to play a safe pass, when his role is surely to give City a dash of the unpredictable. That, of course, is a very fine line; it would be equally unhelpful were Grealish regularly to lose possession by taking needless risks. The clear sense is of him getting used to the system and the system getting used to him.\nThen there is the altogether thornier issue of Raheem Sterling. In 2017-18, he scored 18 league goals. In 2018-19, 17. In 2019-20, 20. Last season, he scored 10. From the end of February, he has managed only two for City, while continuing to score regularly for England. At the Euros, he made oblique reference to the \u201cdifferent reasons\u201d that explained the downturn in his goals record. What they are, though, is unclear, although there was talk in April of a falling-out with Guardiola.\nIn 2019-20, Sterling scored 0.68 league goals a game against an xG of 0.58; last season that fell to 0.35 against an xG of 0.43. He is not only getting fewer chances but is converting fewer of those he does get. At the same time, his number of pressures dropped by 30% and his number of tackles by 51%. That suggests less some sort of tactical redeployment than simply somebody who has become less involved in the game.\nGuardiola has made attempts, particularly over the past year, to protect his side against counterattacks. Last season, at least until the mystifying selection for the Champions League final, it largely worked. But now there is a problem at the other end. City are underscoring their xG only by 0.14 goals a game; last season they outscored it by 0.26 a game. The issue, so far, has been the distribution of the chances taken: rampant against Norwich and Arsenal, toothless against Tottenham and Southampton.\nIt may sort itself out over time, but the worry must be that this is a City that can get disheartened \u2013 and that, perhaps, is an issue a bona fide striker might resolve, even if Guardiola would rather control midfield.",

But officers at the mine site have told the group of traditional owners that they recognise their cultural rights to conduct ceremony, under provisions of the 2019 Queensland Human Rights Act.\nThe situation potentially paves the way for an ongoing standoff at the mine \u2013 where the Queensland government has extinguished native title \u2013 between Adani and Indigenous protesters.\n\u201cWe understand that your connection to culture is disappearing and you don\u2019t want to lose that,\u201d a police officer says in an audio recording shared with Guardian Australia.\n\u201cAt the moment you guys are here and you\u2019re practising culture, and part of that under the Human Rights Act is for that to be practised and shared.\n\u201cWe have no intention at this time is to come in [and remove you], our intention is to support you through that [and] mediate the two groups.\n\u201cInitially we were here [because Adani] were making a complaint against you guys being here, at this time that is not the case. Please note we are not the enforcers here. If they want to do something they\u2019ve got their legal avenues they need to take.\u201d\nIn a formal statement, police said they were still investigating Adani\u2019s complaint.\n\u201cA police command team, including police negotiators and police liaison officers have been in negotiations with all stakeholders involved,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cThis includes people at the camp, mining employees and executives from government departments with a view to obtain a peaceful and non-disruptive resolution into the future.\u201d\nEarlier this year, the Queensland police service issued a \u201cstatement of regret\u201d to W&J man Adrian Burragubba, who complained to the Queensland Human Rights Commission about his removal from a pastoral lease area near the mine site.\nCoedie McAvoy, a Wangan and Jagalingou man and the son of Burragubba, said the group was \u201cpractising our culture and performing traditional ceremony on our home lands, the place of our ancestors\u201d.\n\u201cThe police came in with the understanding that we are practising our human rights. They accepted that we have human rights pursuant to section 28 of the Queensland Human Rights Act and they quoted that section knowing that we are asserting that right. It\u2019s phenomenal that they actually understand the rights that we are asserting.\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming in the history of my family, going back to the separation and removal from country.\n\u201cFor [police] to come back now as representatives of the Queensland government, and accept that we are asserting our right to practise our culture is a great feeling for us.\u201d\n\u201cWe are the first Aboriginal people to use the Human Rights Act to defend our cultural rights and we are going to keep doing it.\u201d\nThe miner has a formal land-use agreement with the W&J people. That agreement is opposed by some traditional owners.\nEarlier this year, the rating agency Moody\u2019s cited ongoing Indigenous opposition to the Adani project while warning miners their credit ratings could be downgraded if they did not maintain good relationships with traditional owners.\n\u201cWhile in this case [Adani] was ultimately given exclusive possession to the land and granted approvals for its mine, the inability to maintain social licence to operate with some members of the local Indigenous community adds another layer of risk to a project that was already facing challenges in maintaining social licence to operate with the broader community because of environment concerns,\u201d the Moodys report said.\n\u201cThis may also add further complexity to a project where some participants from the investment community have signalled an unwillingness to provide funding.\u201d\nAdani said the group at the mine site were \u201canti-fossil fuel activists\u201d who were unlawfully trespassing.\n\u201cThe complaints are now with Queensland Police Service to appropriately deal with,\u201d the miner said.\n\u201cWe are supportive of our traditional owners undertaking cultural practices and ceremonies on their traditional lands and as a responsible landholder we will continue to ensure that when people do wish to access our land properties, they are able to do so in a planned, safe, and respectful manner\n\u201cHowever, we won\u2019t tolerate criminal activity on our mining lease, nor anti-fossil fuel activist group Frontline Action on Coal cloaking their anti-coal protest camp and trespassing under the guise of traditional activity.\u201d",

        "content": "It is the \u2018mystery that must be solved\u2019 \u2013 seven-and-a-half years after the Malaysia Airlines flight disappeared with 239 people on board\nSomewhere in the vast expanse of Earth\u2019s oceans lies MH370, the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared on 8 March 2014 with 239 people on board.\nAuthorities closed the books on the search in 2017, but all over the world people are continuing the hunt. And one day the plane will be found.\nSo says the Australian who was in charge of the amateur search, because people won\u2019t give up looking for it.\nPeter Foley was the program director for the international effort led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Hundreds of people helped search more than 120,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean seafloor. They mapped the area, tried to trace debris back to its origin, and prepared for a recovery mission, before the search was suspended at the start of 2017.\nIn its closing report, the ATSB explained its scientific processes and professed very human emotions while talking directly to the families of the disappeared.\n\u201cWe share your profound and prolonged grief, and deeply regret that we have not been able to locate the aircraft, nor those 239 souls on board that remain missing,\u201d the report says.\n\u201cIt is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era \u2026 for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board.\u201d\nFoley focuses on that empathy and regret, and says MH370 will be found, and it will be found near the area they were looking in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that will enthral people until the mystery is solved,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a mystery that must be solved and will be solved eventually.\u201d\nMH370 disappeared from air traffic control radar 38 minutes into its flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. Analysis of satellite and radar data showed it had kept flying for another seven hours.\nConspiracy theories about what happened abound. On social media people speculate about the involvement of organ harvesters and black holes, aliens and North Korea. Other theories, including that it was a murder/suicide plot by the pilot, or that the pilot was unconscious, have been taken more seriously \u2013 although never confirmed.\nIn January 2018 the Malaysian government contracted marine robotics company Ocean Infinity to send in autonomous underwater vehicles in a \u201cno-find, no-fee\u201d deal. By May they had given up \u2013 for now.\nThere are still dedicated searchers, ranging from conspiracy theorists to well-intentioned amateurs and full-blown experts.\nThey include those who work with new data models and are driven to solve the MH370 mystery for glory, or money, or knowledge, or to give the loved ones left behind some answers.\nDr Ian MacLeod, an expert in shipwrecks, a diver of the deep, and a lover of ocean mysteries, also says it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, it will be found.\nA world-famous authority on maritime corrosion and conservation and a WA Museum fellow, Macleod says MH370 mystery hunters are people who enjoy \u201cunscrambling the bullshit\u201d around what happened to that plane.\n\u201cWhat happens is there are people who do not accept lies, and sniff them out at a thousand paces and who are passionate and persistent and clever,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need those three combinations, just like you need three points of reference to triangulate a falling meteorite.\n\u201cPeople will not give up until the last breath has gone out of their body. People will find it. New information will come to light, governments will change, and they\u2019ll go back and find it.\u201d\nThe Malaysian government said in 2018 that it wasn\u2019t ruling out future missions, and the family members of those lost are urging them on. Ocean Infinity has said it is open to a new search.\nOne of those leading the pack of MH370 detectives is aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey, part of the independent group of scientists hunting for the wreckage.\nSpeaking from Frankfurt in Germany, Godfrey says he\u2019s \u201cquite focused\u201d, spending hours every day for the past seven-and-a-half years on the search. He uses the weak signal propagation report (WSPR) network to track disturbances in radio waves. A global database of radio waves that are reflected or scattered when an aircraft crosses them.\nImagine trip wires forming a mesh across a prairie, he says.\n\u201cEach step you make you tread on particular trip wires and we can locate you \u2026 we can track your path as you move through the prairie.\u201d\nThose disturbances, mapped together with satellites pinging the plane, can help \u201cfill in some of the gaps and help us to know more precisely where MH370 crashed\u201d. He says his findings suggest the MH370 pilot laid false trails to confuse authorities before plunging into the southern Indian Ocean. That in turn suggests the pilot knew what he was doing.\nGodfrey says his interest in the fate of MH370 stemmed from something that happened to him. In 2009 he was booked on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. A week later that same flight, Air France 447, crashed into the Atlantic with 228 people on board. After nearly two years of searching, the main wreckage was found.\nWhen MH370 went missing, Godfrey wanted answers. So do the next-of-kin, he says, and the aviation industry, not to mention anyone who gets on a plane expecting to land safely at the other end.\nThere are many others who share his passion. Wreck hunter Blaine Gibson is still searching for answers. Bob Ballard, who found the Titanic wreck in 1985, wants to help. The families have always said they would keep fighting.\nMacLeod, the Perth-based corrosion expert, talks about what remains and how knowing what\u2019s down there could help those left behind.\nDepending on the damage done on impact, if the plane settled on a hard surface \u2013 say, rock at the bottom of a watery abyss \u2013 it could be well preserved. But if it has sunk into silt, the aluminium will have corroded. Much will depend on where it is, and deep sea currents that can have high or low salinity, high or low temperatures.\nBut it could look \u201cremarkably unchanged\u201d, MacLeod says, with the windows popped out by the pressure, but the tube intact. And it should be left under water, because bringing into the air could see it crumble.\nThe important thing is giving the families closure. MacLeod talks about the emotion of finding the HMAS Sydney, when survivors and relatives went out and laid wreaths over the site.\nAnd he was on the HMAS Anzac for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of AE2 \u2013 Australia\u2019s second submarine \u2013 where joint Australian/Turkish bands played in the memory of those who went down. (Australia\u2019s first submarine, the AE1, was found in 2017 off the coast of Papua New Guinea).\nMacLeod thinks a lot about ocean mysteries and the importance of the rituals of grief.\nAs a boy in Ballarat, he rang the memorial bells to mark Harold Holt\u2019s death on a summer\u2019s day in 1967when the then prime minister went missing in the heavy surf near Portsea in Victoria. He was never seen again. MacLeod rang the bells, and went on to a career based on lives lost at sea.\n\u201cThere are certain rites of passage that you participate in,\u201d he says. \u201cI owe my whole professional career in corrosion and conservation to the death and misfortune of people who got shipwrecked on the WA coast.\n\u201cPeople who lost their lives, that was not in vain, because their story lives on \u2026 that\u2019s what motivates me. It\u2019s why I give public talks about decay and preservation \u2026 even after we\u2019re dead, our stories only begin to be retold in another way, through the processes of decay.\n\u201cEvery bit of decay has a story to tell.\u201d\nFoley is retired now, but is obviously still emotionally connected to the MH370 story, and he has a clear-eyed overview of everything that\u2019s happened since the ATSB search ended.\nHe says he is \u201cextraordinarily keen\u201d to see another search started, for the plane to be found. He is also extraordinarily keen to direct questions about his role back to the work other people did, and the reason they did it \u2013 the families.\n\u201cI honest believe the people who were so far from home in really appalling weather in the Indian Ocean are the absolute heroes of the search and we really worked incredibly hard to find that aircraft,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd it would be such a relief for everyone involved to see it was finally found and that there were answers for 239 families.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s pure dumb luck and a fisherman picks up a piece of debris on a long line or whether it\u2019s an advance in technology that allows us to search in great detail large areas of the ocean floor or whether it\u2019s a philanthropist who uses existing technology \u2026 it will be found.\u201d",

        "content": "Business chiefs accuse ministers of being \u2018missing in action\u2019 amid growing backlash against government\nMinisters have been told that petrol queues in some parts of the country have become worse and army help will not relieve the problem, amid a growing business backlash over the government\u2019s handling of the shortages crisis.\nMilitary drivers are set to be deployed from Monday to deliver fuel to forecourts, after NHS staff and key workers were caught up in queuing that has persisted for days. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, was the latest cabinet minister to attempt to calm concerns yesterday, stating that issues around petrol were \u201cstabilising\u201d in most parts of the country and that military involvement was just a precaution.\nHowever, Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said it remains a \u201creally big problem\u201d in some areas. \u201cIn London and the south-east, and possibly parts of eastern England, if anything it has got worse,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. \u201c[The use of the military] isn\u2019t going to be the major panacea. It\u2019s a large help but in terms of the volume, they are not going to be able to carry that much. Expect anything from 1, 2 or even 3p a litre increases at the pump. This is not profiteering. This is genuine wholesale price increases causes by global factors.\u201d\nBusiness leaders have complained privately that ministers have been \u201cmissing in action\u201d while fuel shortages due to a lack of HGV drivers have led to the closure of thousands of petrol stations. Recent estimates show that around half of the UK\u2019s 8,300 petrol stations were without fuel this weekend.\nA lack of workers has forced farmers to leave crops to rot in the ground and to send animals for slaughter without any certainty that abattoirs have enough workers to process them. The National Pig Association said Britain was facing an \u201cacute welfare disaster\u201d within a matter of weeks, with farmers forced to kill as many as 120,000 pigs because of a shortage of butchers and slaughterers.\nThere are already demands from Labour and other opposition parties for parliament to be recalled so that thousands of emergency visas for HGV drivers and poultry industry workers can be approved. Ministers have had to extend the length of the new HGV driver visas into next year after criticism that they were too short-term to attract workers.\nThere is now a backlash from business groups against government claims that the shortages of drivers and workers in agriculture, meat processing and hospitality were part of a deliberate \u201ctransition\u201d away from an economy reliant on foreign labour to a higher-wage economy using skilled workers in the UK.\nKwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said Britain would have to \u201ctough it out\u201d as the change was made. \u201cHaving rejected the low-wage, high-immigration model, we were always going to try to transition to something else,\u201d he told the ConservativeHome website. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is part of that transition.\u201d\nThose remarks have been immediately challenged by business figures, who said that most wages had been increasing already, there were shortages in higher-wage industries and there was not a huge pool of available workers in Britain.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s departure from the European Union has reduced the supply of labour available to UK businesses for roles that currently cannot be filled locally,\u201d said Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce.\n\u201cBusiness will support the government\u2019s ambition to move to a sustainably high-skilled, high-wage economy which does more to harness homegrown skills and talents, but this a huge transition that will not happen overnight. An individual business or sector cannot make this adjustment alone.\n\u201cIt requires government and business to come together to develop a plan for the future which addresses short-term challenges and meets longer-term ambitions. Simply riding it out is not an option. Our economic recovery will be curtailed unless action is taken now.\u201d\nKitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said labour shortages went beyond low-wage jobs. \u201cMore of our members report shortages among managers, professions and skilled workers than reported shortages in the sectors that are traditionally lower paid,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a systemic response from government, not a sticking plaster.\u201d\nRetailers also hit back. Tom Ironside, from the British Retail Consortium, said wages within the industry had risen by 44% since 2008. \u201cDespite this, recent labour shortages \u2013 from HGV drivers to warehouse staff \u2013 have exposed an absence of suitably trained candidates for roles throughout the retail industry and its supply chains,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRetailers are working hard to train and retain British talent, increasing wages, investing in training programmes and offering apprenticeships schemes. However, the government must address the immediate HGV driver shortage and we urge government to extend their new visa scheme, in scope and size, to prevent disruption for consumers this Christmas.\u201d",

If approved, Morrisons will become a private company, and will no longer trade on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe auction effectively ends a four-month battle for the grocer, which has dragged on since CD&R, which is being advised by the former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, first made an approach in June.\n\u201cWe are gratified by the recommendation of the Morrisons board and look forward to the shareholder vote to approve the transaction,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to believe that Morrisons is an excellent business, with a strong management team, a clear strategy, and good prospects.\u201d\nThe total value of CD&R\u2019s final offer, when including debt, is worth \u00a39.8bn. The offer cannot be increased unless a new suitor emerges with a firm bid for the supermarket chain.\nMorrisons chairman Andrew Higginson said CD&R\u2019s offer was \u201cexcellent value\u201d \u2013 representing a 61% premium to Morrisons\u2019 closing price of 178p before the firm made its first bid in June \u2013 and would protect the \u201cfundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders\u201d.\n\u201cCD&R have good retail experience, a strong record of developing and growing the businesses in which they invest, and they share our vision and ambition for Morrisons. We remain confident that CD&R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of an important British grocery business,\u201d he added. \u201cThe board is confident that Morrisons will continue to go from strength to strength under CD&R\u2019s ownership.\u201d\nFortress admitted defeat shortly after the bids were made public on Saturday afternoon, with its managing partner Joshua Pack saying he wished the company and all those involved \u201cthe very best for the future\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe UK remains a very attractive investment environment from many perspectives, and we will continue to explore opportunities to help strong management teams grow their businesses and create long-term value.\u201d\nCD&R\u2019s pre-auction offer of 285p had already gained the support of the Morrisons board, having promised that the company\u2019s head office would remain in Bradford and confirmed there were no plans to sell off its store estate to raise cash.\nThe private equity firm also said it was fully supportive of Morrisons\u2019 recent pay award of at least \u00a310 an hour for all colleagues in stores and manufacturing sites, and had reached a deal with pensions trustees in mid-September to provide additional security and support to the scheme, which has 53,600 members. Fortress was reportedly in talks with pension trustees on Friday in an attempt to clinch a similar agreement ahead of the auction.\nUnions and politicians have been anxious about the wave of private equity takeovers aimed at UK firms, amid concerns companies would be stripped of their property holdings, loaded up with debt, and worker conditions would deteriorate.\nMorrisons employs about 120,000 staff in the UK, including across its 497 supermarkets, as well as factories, farms and a company-owned fishing trawler.\nSaturday\u2019s auction, which was managed by the City\u2019s Takeover Panel that oversees the process for mergers and acquisitions in the UK, was triggered after neither bidder declared final offers over the last four months. In order to avoid a draw, Fortress had been asked to put forward a final bid with an \u201ceven\u201d number of pence, while CD&R was told to offer a bid with an \u201codd\u201d number.\nShareholders will vote on the offer on 19 October.",

Intensity has been superseded by a manager at ease \u2013 with his team and himself.\nThis new geniality appeared in May when City beat Paris Saint-Germain in their semi to reach a first Champions League final. When Guardiola\u2019s third Premier League title was secured with three games to spare, it deepened. Come the next season and fresh travails, it was easy to assume Guardiola would return to his more recognisable persona.\nBut after Tuesday\u2019s 2-0 loss at PSG the City manager was again in genial mode when professing contentment at his team\u2019s display.\nPreparing for Sunday\u2019s trip to a venue where last term\u2019s 4-1 victory over Liverpool was a first City win in 18 years and asked if emotions are acute before such a high-stakes encounter, Guardiola says: \u201cAbsolutely I enjoy them \u2013 all those feelings have to be there: excitement, nervous, pressure, all those emotions, yes. If you don\u2019t have it for the big important games, then it shows that this business is not for you.\n\u201cMaybe you sleep not so well the day before and well after \u2013 if the result or performance has not been good. [But] you can\u2019t go there like you\u2019re going to the restaurant with friends because then it\u2019s not for you. I still have nerves before the game, wondering if the plan will go good \u2013 if you don\u2019t get this you are in the wrong business. You have to feel [this].\u201d\nGuardiola is similarly unruffled about City\u2019s challenge of facing a J\u00fcrgen Klopp team that lead City by a point in the Premier League, and who will tear at the champions with a raucous Anfield roaring them on. \u201cThey won the Champions League and the Premier League [under Klopp] \u2013 and all the time they are playing and competing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens, it doesn\u2019t matter which competition. They play with high intensity in all senses, they are a typical J\u00fcrgen team, a fantastic team.\n\u201cI admire J\u00fcrgen for that \u2013 they try to play their game whatever. He knows that we are the same. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens, we have a go. Mistakes, weak points, it doesn\u2019t matter. We are who we are as a team \u2013 Manchester City are a team that\u2019s going to go this way. If it\u2019s going well, great. If it\u2019s going badly, improve. I don\u2019t know another way to do it. We did it last year, it worked. So we are going to try and do it again.\u201d\nCity boast 14 different scorers this season , the perfect riposte to those who view the failure to land Harry Kane in the close season as a strategic blunder. Guardiola jokes when asked: what if the goals dry up?\n\u201cWhat will be the plan B? Buy two strikers for \u00a3250m?\u201d he says. \u201cNo. We [will] have to play better, [load] more people in the box. The biggest strikers in the world score because they are in front of the goal \u2013 there are no secrets to this. So once we are there [in position] we have to have the quality to put it in the back of the net.\n\u201cIt is impossible to score if you are not close, it\u2019s a question of mathematics [numbers near goal], for sure. And that\u2019s what we have to do \u2013 make the process so we arrive there, then try to finish in front of the goal.\u201d\nGuardiola remains calm even when he is reminded of City\u2019s coach being attacked at Anfield three years ago. \u201cYou cannot imagine how bad it was,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish it would never happen again.\u201d\nThe smart money says Guardiola\u2019s nerves will fray at some point but there seems a fresh sense of self-possession that cannot be shaken, and which is a sweet augury for City\u2019s campaign.",

        "content": "Fears that controversial leader is lining up his daughter as his successor\nPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte has announced that he will retire from politics and abandon his bid to become vice-president in next year\u2019s election, fuelling speculation that his daughter Sara Duterte will instead run for office.\nDuterte had previously accepted a nomination by his party to stand in the May election, a controversial plan that could have allowed him to retain power beyond the limits of his six-year term. However, recent polling suggests that many Filipinos disapproved of the idea, which critics warned would undermine the constitution.\nAddressing reporters on Saturday, Duterte, 76, said he had halted his bid \u201cin obedience to the will of the people\u201d.\n\u201cThe overwhelming sentiment of the Filipino is that I\u2019m not qualified, and it would be a violation of the constitution,\u201d Duterte said. \u201cI will follow what you wish and today I announce my retirement from politics.\u201d\nThe latest comments by the president, who also announced his retirement in 2015, are likely to be treated with cynicism. He will, say analysts, be determined to ensure a loyal successor who will protect him from potential prosecution by the international criminal court. It announced last month that it is investigating his so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, in which as many as 30,000 people are estimated to have been killed.\nCurrently the mayor of Davao, Sara Duterte, 43, is leading in the polls and appears to have benefited from her father\u2019s enduring popularity. She has in the past said she will not run if her father also competes for a national position next year.\nHowever, ABS-CBN news reported on Saturday that Duterte himself had appeared to tell a broadcast journalist that his closest loyalist, senator Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go would run alongside his daughter.\nHe was asked: \u201cSo is it clear, Sara-Go?\u201d\n\u201cIt is Sara-Go,\u201d Duterte said in response.\n\u201cMuch of the public sees this as political theatre,\u201d said Jean Franco, associate professor at the department of political science at the University of the Philippines.\n\u201cHe has a history of dilly-dallying and then suddenly running\u2026 At least at the moment people seem to be sceptical of his statement that he is retiring. People seem to be anticipating another move in the coming days,\u201d she added.\nAs Duterte withdrew his candidacy yesterday, Go instead registered to run for vice-president.\nMore than 60 million Filipinos will vote in May for a new president, vice president and 18,000 other positions, including at the local government level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a circus,\u201d said Franco. \u201cBut by now I\u2019m pretty sure all the candidates are talking about is the father and daughter political theatre that happened today.\u201d",

        "content": "The Polluter Pays principle applies to flats as much as fridges \u2013 and residents should not be left in the lurch\nThree days after that dreadful night in 2017 when fire surged through Grenfell Tower, killing scores of its inhabitants and destroying the homes of many more, I was travelling home from York when my phone rang.\nThe call was from the chief executive of the Manchester-based housing association that I chair. A brand new apartment block we had recently opened, providing high quality housing for older people, was one of the first properties to fail the emergency fire tests being rolled out across Britain\u2019s high-rise homes.\nBy the time the media arrived later that afternoon, the cherrypickers were busy at work taking down the offending cladding.\nI\u2019d like that to be the end of the story, but it isn\u2019t.\nFire-spreading cladding has proved the catalyst for a far-ranging, and arguably long overdue, reassessment of the status of multistorey dwellings. Buildings previously passed as safe were suddenly, and correctly, redesignated as high risk.\nStructural problems were exposed, ones that go far wider than inadequate materials fixed to external walls. And with every fresh realisation of just how unsafe many homes are, the cost of remediation has soared higher.\nThe leasehold system, through which many large apartment blocks are owned, was set up to pay for the common services and elements of a building, while ceding to each household the ownership of their home.\nIt was never intended to handle the massive remediation costs that have overnight reduced the mortgageable value of a high-rise (or medium-rise) apartment to zero.\nMany residents are now trapped, living in properties deemed unsafe, paying the costs of nightly \u201cwaking watches\u201d while facing repair bills of tens of thousands of pounds.\nWith prospective purchasers unable to obtain a loan, current owners cannot sell, even when family circumstances make that a necessity.\nFor the last couple of years I\u2019ve been lending my voice and my support to the Manchester Cladiators, a wonderfully named group who are proving every bit as tenacious as the most ferocious fighters of the Roman empire.\nAlong with similar groups around the country, they are campaigning to get their homes back to a state in which they are both safe to live in and can be sold for their proper value.\nTo me, it seems plainly unjust that they should pay the price of other people\u2019s mistakes, and as a bishop with more than 30 years\u2019 active involvement in housing associations, it feels like an injustice I want to do something about.\nI believe there are answers. If I bought a car, or a washing machine, and that model were later found to have a propensity to burst into flames, I would expect the maker to recall it, to repair or replace, at their own expense, whatever was necessary.\nThe fact that the fault had been unknown at the time of manufacture would be no excuse to evade responsibility.\nNor would it be acceptable to waste years dithering over the details, leaving me to bear the safety risk in the meantime.\nThe principle that the person who created the problem should resolve it, succinctly known as Polluter Pays, can be as applicable to a flat as to an appliance.\nThe building safety bill on parliament\u2019s timetable presents the perfect opportunity to resolve things once and for all, by including clauses to allow determination that a building was constructed wrongly, or with wrong materials, and to direct the costs of remediation back on to the developer.\nEuropean human rights law supports the view that parent companies could be made responsible where development was led by a special purpose vehicle that no longer exists with funds.\nWhere no developer can be found, or no breach of regulations occurred, public funds could be reimbursed via an industry levy. None of this need involve residents in lengthy and expensive legal action.\nI struggle to believe that it is entirely coincidental that individuals and bodies connected with the construction industry have been such generous political donors and assiduous lobbyists in the years (too many already) since Grenfell went up in flames.\nBut I do know that many MPs and peers, including Conservatives, support our efforts.\nWe will be taking our message, politely but firmly, to their party conference here in Manchester this weekend. And to every other major political stage we can speak on, until Britain\u2019s homes are made safe.",

        "content": "Craig\u2019s final outing as the secret agent is too long and needs a better villain, but attempts at real change to the 007 formula feel fun and fresh\nPerhaps more than any previous Bond, the Daniel Craig era has, for better or worse, managed to tap into the mood of the British national psyche with each new film. Casino Royale, released the year after the 7 July London terror attacks, was a lean, focused and brutally businesslike proposition. Quantum of Solace was messy, noisy and slightly panicky. And subsequent films brought us a Bond who was forced to do battle on two fronts, both against Spectre and his own irrelevance on an increasingly tech-enabled killing field. Essentially British exceptionalism made flesh and wrapped in a Savile Row suit and a sneer, Bond ploughed on with the old ways, at considerable cost to those around him.\nNow Craig\u2019s swansong in the role arrives, nearly 18 months later than originally planned. And like many of us, it\u2019s bloated and flabby around the mid-section and prone to moments of confusion. But it\u2019s also the first Bond movie in forever that attempts real change, tearing down some of the well-worn conventions of the 007 formula. All of which should heighten the anticipation around the casting of Craig\u2019s replacement no end.\nThe first indication that this might not be business as usual comes at the very start, when, as tradition has it, Bond films usually kick off in an exotic locale with an extravagant action set piece. Not this time. The film opens in a forest chalet in the dead of winter where a little girl lives with a mother who has sunk into bitterness and blurry self-medication. It\u2019s the kind of place you go to hide, a remote and icy backdrop reminiscent of Joe Wright\u2019s Hanna. And when a visitor does arrive \u2013 a figure in a Japanese kabuki mask \u2013 it\u2019s clearly not a courtesy call. It\u2019s probably best to leave a question mark over the identity of the girl, her mother and the masked man: suffice to say it\u2019s an unusual, unexpectedly generous move for the film to shift the focus from Bond, even for a moment, in order to offer up a backstory for another character.\nOnce the film finally reconnects with Bond, we find him enjoying his retirement on the Mediterranean coast, with perma-mope Madeleine Swann (L\u00e9a Seydoux) at his side. Some stilted dialogue exchanges establish the fact that trust issues abound and both are guarding secrets from their past; the fact that their holiday seems to be a grand tour of the sites of traumatic memories also suggests that there may yet be some emotional baggage left to be unpacked.\nOne element that seems to be resistant to change is the lack of chemistry between Craig and Seydoux, despite the input of director Cary Joji Fukanaga. After their drably decorous courtship in Spectre, theirs is a polite but rather tepid relationship, while Craig\u2019s Bond is comically ill at ease with the concept of empathy, fumbling with it as if somebody just handed him a baby to admire and he has literally no idea what to do with it.\nHave the changes in approach reached Bond himself? Yes and no. On the one hand, Craig\u2019s default setting of low-level irritation has stewed and simmered; the fuse is markedly shorter, and he spends much of the film snarling through the windscreen of his Aston Martin DB5 looking like a road-rage incident waiting to happen. On the other, there\u2019s a newfound respect for his female colleagues \u2013 it\u2019s a welcome move away from 007\u2019s modus operandi of casual workplace harassment, which may or may not be due to the input of Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\nA spiky rivalry between Bond and Nomi (Lashana Lynch, forcefully charismatic in a slightly underwritten role), his replacement in the 00 programme, gives way to a genuine admiration for her skill as an agent. And Ana de Armas as Cuban field agent Paloma is a delight, necking her martini and channelling her \u201cthree weeks of training\u201d into a flamboyant, tango-infused killing spree. Even Craig\u2019s sourpuss secret agent seems to be having a blast when Paloma\u2019s (all too briefly) on screen. It\u2019s a glimpse of something that has been MIA from the Bond movies of late \u2013 pulpy, escapist fun.\nAnd this is where the film slips up. With a Bond as dangerous but dour as Craig\u2019s, the onus is on the villain to inject a little levity, hence the ham-tastic turns from Javier Bardem and Cristoph Waltz in the most recent outings. This film\u2019s main bad guy is Rami Malek\u2019s lacklustre Lyutsifer Safin. We know that he\u2019s evil because of his facial scarring (and really, enough now with this nonsense) and the fact that he puts loaded pauses in the middle of sentences. His brutalist concrete lair is enviable, his bag of nefarious tricks contains a nanotech, gene-targeted bioweapon called Heracles, but his motives in deploying it are muddy. It\u2019s a problem. A Bond film is only as good as its villain, after all.\nElsewhere, the film looks to the past as well as the future. Hans Zimmer\u2019s score weaves in references to past films, notably We Have All the Time in the World from On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service. It\u2019s a smart motif that effectively taps into the goodwill and nostalgia for Bonds past while dropping hints of things to come. You don\u2019t need to be a Bond aficionado to know that anyone who thinks they have all the time in the world invariably hasn\u2019t.",

        "content": "A water industry group is calling for legislation and planning controls to protect waterways from climate change and pollution\nEngland\u2019s rivers are facing a crisis from climate change, agricultural pollution and lack of effective planning controls. That is the key warning of Water UK, the industry group that represents the nation\u2019s water suppliers.\nIn a report to be published this week, the authority will call for the government to set up a national rivers plan and enact a rivers act to ensure the health of the country\u2019s waterways. \u201cWe are calling for a new deal for rivers in England,\u201d it states.\nThe report \u2013 21st Century Rivers: Ten Actions for Change \u2013 says that despite billions of pounds being spent on improving water quality over the past 30 years, only 14% of England\u2019s rivers are rated as being in a good condition, a figure that has remained unchanged since 2009.\nYet the government is aiming to get 75% of all rivers to this standard by 2027. If ministers want to achieve this goal, a radical transformation in dealing with rivers will have to be implemented, said Christine McGourty, chief executive of Water UK.\n\u201cRivers have been in a state of crisis for much of the last hundred years, and though there\u2019s been huge progress in the last few decades, there\u2019s much more to do. So we\u2019re asking government to bring forward legislation in a new rivers act that will provide greater protection for them in law.\u201d\nRivers encapsulate the peacefulness and beauty of the English countryside \u2013 from the grandeur of the Thames to the tranquil graces of rivers such as the Wye and the Stour. However, modern life has taken its toll on these waterways. Since 1985, there has been a 70% increase in household water use in England as more and more homes have been fitted with showers, dishwashers and washing machines.\nAs a result, water abstraction rates have soared across the country, leading to the drying out of rivers and streams. Global heating is triggering more and more heatwaves, which are worsening the crisis.\nIn addition, pesticide, nutrient and waste run-offs from farms are causing blooms of algae to spread down rivers while sewage discharges are still causing headaches.\nAn example of the problems facing England\u2019s rivers is provided by the Chess at Chesham in Buckinghamshire. It is a chalk stream, one of the planet\u2019s rarest habitats, with 85% of them occurring in England. Flag iris and water crowfoot thrive on their banks, while otters, kingfishers and water voles make their homes there.\nOr at least they used to. Beginning in the 1990s, the Chess began to dry out, sometimes for several years in a row, as abstraction rates soared and heatwaves persisted.\nFor their part, water companies say they have invested more than \u00a330bn on environmental improvements across the country and these have reduced serious pollution incidents and helped the recovery of habitats and species.\nAn example is provided by Affinity Water, which used to take about 6m litres of water a day from the River Chess around Chesham. However, it has recently halted this abstraction with the specific aim of restoring the Chess to its former glory.\nMoves such as this are a step in the right direction, states the Water UK report. \u201cHowever, the truth, though, is that this is not enough,\u201d it adds.\nA key problem is that water company activities are controlled by the Water Industry Act of 1991 but its provisions for dealing with environmental problems such as the discharge of sewage are outdated.\n\u201cThey focus on protecting public health rather than the environment,\u201d the report states. \u201cA lack of legal efficiency standards mean we needlessly waste water by using appliances like dishwashers or washing machines while non-degradable \u2018flushable\u2019 wet wipes cause overflow triggering fatbergs.\u201d\nWhat is needed, it says, is a rivers act, which would involve introducing a series of measures for protecting England\u2019s waterways. (The report is specifically targeted at England\u2019s rivers because most UK environmental protection measures have been devolved.)\nThese measures would include:\n Setting minimum standards to limit water use by washing machines and dishwashers.\n Toughening regulations over the use of chemicals such as pesticides, which are often chosen without assessing their impact on marine life.\n Halting bodies such as highway agencies from discharging untreated waste into rivers.\n Making the manufacturers of wet wipes, sanitary products and other frequently flushed items pay for cleaning up blockages and pollution triggered by their products.\nIn addition, the report points out that 41% of UK wildlife is in decline, with 15% threatened with extinction. \u201cThe water environment is central to much of that biodiversity but most funding is heavily focused on water quality rather than habitat protection and restoration.\u201d\nTo get round this problem, the report says, measures are needed to encourage water companies, landowners and local communities to work together to get round these problems.\n\u201cThe risk is that billions of pounds of investment is otherwise narrowly targeted at removing nutrients from the ends of pipes, while causing other kinds of environmental harm and ignoring goals like habitat and species restoration.\u201d\nWater UK also urges getting the government, local authorities and industry to cooperate on establishing a bathing rivers network across the country. Last year a stretch of the River Wharfe in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, was designated England\u2019s first inland bathing water. \u201cIt is an innovation that should be repeated across the nation,\u201d states the report.",

        "content": "As wildfires burn hotter and bigger due to dry conditions, scientists are afraid the species may not survive much longer\nIt is still unclear how the giant sequoias of California will fare as two fires \u2013 which together have scorched more than 140,000 acres in their namesake national park and national forest \u2013 continue to burn. Thick smoke and rugged inaccessible terrain has hindered efforts to assess destruction from the KNP Complex and Windy fires, and a full accounting may take weeks.\nScientists on the ground say so far the news has been both good and bad. There are still pockets of lush greenery left within the footprints of two fast-moving fires, as well as areas where the flames left little in their wake.\nBut one thing remains abundantly clear: with drier and hotter conditions, the fires the forests \u2013 and the stakes \u2013 have changed.\nThe incredibly resilient giant sequoias that have grown on these ridges for thousands of years, coexisting and evolving with wildfires that helped keep overgrowth at bay and clear space needed for seedlings. But as the climate crisis intensified conditions, causing fires to burn bigger and hotter, the tall trees are starting to succumb in larger numbers. During last year\u2019s Castle fire, which blackened 175,000 acres in Sequoia national park, up to 14% of the world\u2019s sequoias were lost to the flames \u2013 an alarming development for the trees once believed to be largely fire-resistant.\nScientists are now afraid the species may not survive if wildfires continue to grow more severe.\n\u201cI have been suspending disbelief before I enter any grove,\u201d said Garrett Dickman, a biologist at Yosemite national park, who is involved in the damage assessments in the groves impacted by the Windy fire. He has already witnessed spans of torched land where the fire burned so hot the trees were incinerated down to the last twig and branch. In one grove, where he counted 29 of the tall trees destroyed, the ashen aftermath was littered with fallen fragments, their original shape burned into the soil. \u201cYou can almost think of it like a chalk outline of a giant sequoia,\u201d he said.\nClimate change has set in motion a devastating cycle, made worse by years of land management practices that enabled the forest to become overgrown. Parched vegetation fuels the fires as the hot, dry conditions whip flares faster and higher into the forest canopy, threatening the trees that once thrived in the flames.\nMired in drought, the overgrowth dries and dies, littering the forest floor. In nearby Yosemite, where Dickman typically works, he said there was an eye-popping 125 tons of biomass that needed to be removed on every acre \u2013 more than 10 times the amount he calls normal. \u201cIt is like having a 737 made of wood parked on every acre, but instead of it being full of jet oil it is full of kiln-dried lumber,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it burns, it burns hotter, drier and faster than ever before. Trees that were totally immune to this in the past are no longer.\u201d\nThe death toll for the trees is expected to be significant. But there have also been big wins during the at-times-dramatic firefights, and many popular groves have been spared. In others, where the flames got in but severity was low or moderate, researchers believe the burn will be beneficial.\nAnthony Ambrose, a forest ecologist and researcher at the non-profit organization the Marmot Society, said the fate of a grove depends on what condition it was in before the fire and the weather patterns, such as wind, heat and humidity, when the flames burned through. But even if trees survive the flames, they may be weakened enough to succumb to other ailments, such as beetle attacks.\nAmbrose says scientists have been seeing such attacks on singed trees, further weakened by the drought \u2013 a phenomenon that had not been documented until recent years. \u201cIf they are healthy trees, they are able to fight off any attack but what we are seeing now is this kind of novel combination of impacts from fire and drought that are making the trees vulnerable.\u201d\nWith little relief on the horizon and another dry winter in the forecast, drought conditions are expected to worsen over the next year. That does not bode well for scorched sequoias.\nNathan Stephenson, a government scientist based in Sequoia national park who has studied the impact climate change is having on forests, said the outcome could become a permanent shift. \u201cThere is a good possibility that a lot of these forests may not come back as forests in our lifetime,\u201d he said, adding that other plants and trees could soon replace the giants that have stood there through the centuries. \u201cPeople often think that because climatic warming is happening slowly \u2026 ecosystems are going to change slowly and adapt as the climate changes.\u201d Instead, he explained, the climate hits a threshold that can change landscapes and ecosystems in abrupt and extreme ways.\n\u201cYou have burning conditions we haven\u2019t seen in the past,\u201d he said, noting that crown fires, when flames soar high into the air and burn through canopies, were never before seen in giant sequoias.\nStill, there will be many areas where fire behavior is not extreme. Stephenson said this isn\u2019t either a bad story or a good one. It\u2019s both. Fire is an essential ingredient for forest health and even in big blazes that exhibit extreme behavior there are often important benefits.\n\u201cIt is certainly bad when 10-14% of all big sequoias get killed but other groves in that fire burned in a beneficial way that will make them more resilient to wildfires in the future,\u201d he said of the Castle fire last year. \u201cThe same thing is going on now.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of this year\u2019s fires, there will still be big steps to take. Policymakers will have to decide whether to replant the areas that were severely burned and how to clear the fallen firs and pines killed in the flames from the forest floor. It won\u2019t be long before the victims of this fire act as fuel for the next one. \u201cYou have a window where you can catch your breath,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cBut we are still going to have to look to the future.\u201d",

Series producer Jeff Wilson said it had not only kept the production on track but also improved the chances of capturing wonderful moments that will be wowing audiences this autumn.\nWilson said: \u201cYou\u2019re always trying to get your field crew in the right place at the right time. That\u2019s the key skill and it is limited by budgets and weather windows. If you can reduce the risk about being in the right place at the right time by having someone local there for longer, you give yourself the opportunity to create even something more magical.\u201d\nA case in point was the bullfrog scenes. \u201cAfrican bullfrogs come out for their mating game at a very specific time after there has been a certain amount of rain to create pools large enough for them to collect in. You get a whole bunch of enormous frogs coming together as if they\u2019re gathering in a bar on a Saturday night and fighting for access to females. This only happens over two or three days and when that happens is anyone\u2019s guess, especially with climatic changes.\u201d\nA South African filmmaker, Russell MacLaughlin, lives close to the spot in Limpopo province and so could be on hand when the right rain swept in. McLaughlin said he began waiting for the moment in November last year but it was not until February that two cyclones hit the African shoreline in quick succession. The pools filled and the frogs appeared. \u201cWe were based two hours from there. You have to react very quickly. It\u2019s absolute chaos and then it\u2019s all over,\u201d he said.\nSilverback, which is part of All3Media, hired a young Australian, Alex Vail, to film the manta rays off Australia. He spent 16 weeks awaiting their arrival. Vail was also responsible for some extraordinary scenes of hermaphroditic Persian carpet flatworms \u201cfencing\u201d with their penises on the Great Barrier Reef.\nWilson said it did not mean UK-based filmmakers would not travel again but using locals helped balance the gamble of being in the right place at the right time. He said it meant greater risks could be taken with another sequence \u2013 for example, you might feel confident enough to send a cameraperson from the UK to spend 15 weeks in a hide in Russia if you knew you were able to rely on a local person to be ready to leap into action in another part of the world. \u201cIt gives us more scope to blow people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said.\nAnother highlight of the series is scenes of snot otters, also known as hellbenders. The males allow each other to fertilise a female\u2019s eggs, an unusual piece of altruism. Wilson said: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have achieved the sequence we have without guys based on the ground in north America who know these rivers and the nuances of the behaviour and have spent a lot of time with their face in a mask in a very cold river.\u201d\nKeith Scholey, co-founder and CEO of Silverback, said that over the last few decades hard-to-use, high definition cameras had become the normal tool for wildlife filmmakers. Recent years have seen investment in teaching people from around the world how to use them.\nBetter communications \u2013 it can be as easy to get a 4G signal in the wilds of South Africa as in the US \u2013 means staying in touch with local crews is becoming ever easier. \u201cWe\u2019re much more aware of the carbon cost of travel so all this makes sense,\u201d said Scholey.",

        "content": "Rising prices and lack of goods are what happens when just-in-time economy collides with seat-of-the-pants government\nIt all seems to have happened so fast. Only a few months ago, the government was congratulating itself for the speed at which Britain was emerging from the pandemic. But as the nights have lengthened, there have been empty shelves at supermarkets, spiralling energy prices and queues snaking back from petrol stations.\nIf there is a general sense of bemusement at all this, then there really shouldn\u2019t be. This is what happens when just-in-time production methods collide with just-in-time government and turn a problem into a crisis.\nLessons have clearly not been learned from the financial crisis of 2008. Then, it was just-in-time banking that had its fundamental weakness exposed; namely that institutions had insufficient reserves of capital to absorb losses. Now a similar problem has affected production supply chains; there is not enough slack in the system to cope with an unexpected shock.\nJust-in-time supply chains were designed around lean production and minimal inventories as a way of cutting back on waste and costs. But while management consultants loved them, they really only functioned in the good times. In the case of car production, the problem was a shortage of computer chips. In the case of energy, supplies of gas could not keep up with demand \u2013 especially from Asia \u2013 as economic recoveries took hold.\nNo country in the world has been immune from supply bottlenecks, but Britain has suffered more than most. The reason for that is that a seat-of-the-pants approach is hardwired into the British system of governance, with an almost complete lack of planning and a messianic belief in market forces.\nThe lack of HGV drivers is a case in point. The haulage industry has been warning of problems for more than half a decade, telling ministers that more drivers were leaving the industry than joining it, and that the shortages would be exacerbated by Brexit. The government did nothing, even when the problem was compounded by the pandemic, and have responded by offering 5,000 temporary visas to overseas lorry drivers. This is a classic case of too little, too late. It will be interesting to see how many drivers will be attracted to the UK by the lure of (at most) two months\u2019 work. Well short of 5,000 in all likelihood.\nUltimately, market forces will work. If the wages on offer are raised sufficiently, the supply of new drivers will increase and the shortages will disappear. But they may not arrive in time to keep supermarket shelves stocked for Christmas.\nSimilarly, the reason the UK is entering the winter with its lowest stocks of gas in a decade is because of a lack of storage. This follows the closure in 2017 of the Rough facility, which provided 70% of the UK\u2019s storage capacity for 30 years, as a result of a government decision not to subsidise the costly maintenance and upgrades needed to keep the site going.\nBritain now has just 1% of Europe\u2019s storage capacity, enough to cope with four or five cold winter days.\nSometimes the government gets it right. The furlough, put together at rapid pace in the emergency conditions of March 2020 when the UK was facing mass unemployment, is an example of just-in-time policymaking that worked. The success of wage subsidies is the exception not the rule, however. The cobbled-together scheme for dealing with NHS waiting lists and long-term social care needs is far more typical.\nBusiness tends to be quicker than officialdom at spotting trends and was already adjusting to a post-just-in-time world before the Covid-19 crisis. After decades of offshoring, production is being brought back onshore for four key reasons: the cost benefits are no longer as great as they were; a sense that shorter supply chains mean less vulnerability to external events; a growing fear of China; and pressure to reduce carbon footprints.\nBut governments \u2013 including the UK government \u2013 are starting to get the message. Britain\u2019s relations with China are much cooler than they were when David Cameron was prime minister and Brexit has led to a willingness to embrace state aid and industrial policy.\nThe real test, though, is still to come, because having made the transition from a manufacturing to a service sector dominated in the late 20th century, the coming years are supposed to see the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe former coalfields and the old industrial heartlands of south Wales, the central belt of Scotland, and the northern regions of England are still scarred by the shock treatment administered in the 1970s, 80s and early 90s. Only after factories had been bulldozed and pits shut was much thought given to what those affected by the loss of their livelihoods would do next. Eventually, low-paid insecure jobs took the place of well-paid unionised employment as call centres replaced the collieries.\nThe damage to those communities has never been remotely repaired, and that should be a lesson to the current generation of policymakers because the transition to a low-carbon economy will be an equally painful affair if not handled with extreme care.\nOne small benefit from the current chaos is that it should act as a warning of proceeding without a plan. The transition requires time, sensitivity, investment, collaboration between the public and private sectors, and a willingness to learn from past mistakes.\nIt is a fantasy to expect such a profound change in the economy to happen without substantial disruption. The real question is whether the disruption is so painful that public support for net zero drains away. What\u2019s certain is that just-in-time won\u2019t cut it.",

Nothing had been stolen. She declined to say what the message was but said: \u201cThe wording made it clear that it was a targeted attack.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be intimidated, I\u2019m not going to stop doing my job.

Tony Eckersley, 52, from Salford in Greater Manchester, sent Phillips more than 300 threatening messages over nine months including a threat to \u201chave her dealt with\u201d.\n\u201cI feel that this intimidation of women has just got to stop. Women are targeted because of the jobs they do, because they\u2019re in the public eye and, in light of everything that\u2019s happened with the Sarah Everard case, it really feels like we need a cultural change,\u201d said Siddiq.\nShe called on social media companies to take more action to prevent abuse from happening: \u201cAbuse online can manifest into things offline, and we need to nip it in the bud,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "If I have learned one thing from my experience in this ocean of harm, it is that change will never happen if the organizations and individuals perpetrating abuse aren\u2019t held accountable\nThe horrific stories about North Carolina Courage coach Paul Riley \u2013 abuse that is alleged to have taken place while he was in charge at several top clubs in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League \u2013 were personally triggering. I have heard countless accounts of harm in sport over the last few years, and the patterns in the stories of Riley\u2019s abusive behavior \u2013 and those of his enablers \u2013 are strikingly familiar.\nIn February 2019, after some teammates and I had tried to report our own story of abuse and its aftermath over 30 times to no avail, I published a blog post entitled: A Horrific Canadian Soccer Story \u2013 The Story No One Wants to Listen To, But Everyone Needs to Hear.\nIt detailed a sordid story of abuse by my former coach Bob Birarda, who had simultaneously been head coach for the Vancouver Whitecaps Women and Canada\u2019s U20 World Cup teams, overseeing players who included some that recently won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\nDue to Birarda\u2019s abuse, it\u2019s fair to say that players that could have been in Tokyo had long left the game.\nThe Guardian reported on these allegations after the blog was published and dug a little deeper into the allegations. What myself and other young and ambitious players knew then was that \u2013 in addition to Birarda\u2019s other role as an assistant coach with Canada\u2019s Olympic team in 2008 \u2013 he was undoubtedly the gatekeeper for reaching the top of women\u2019s soccer in Canada at the time.\nWith that power and no oversight or accountability, he knew he could do what he wanted \u2013 and get away with it. One of Birarda\u2019s former players recently described the environment around him as: \u201che either wanted to fuck you or destroy you\u201d.\nLike the experiences with Riley shared by NWSL players, the power wielded by abusive coaches stems from players knowing that if they push back against inappropriate behavior they can be dropped on a moment\u2019s notice. With no safe place for female players to report harm, abusive coaches are further emboldened.\nWhen a player does bravely come forward, another pattern emerges. An internal \u201cinvestigation\u201d leads to quiet departure and the coach emerges elsewhere to continue the abuse. Portland Thorns moved Riley on (for his part, he denies most of the allegations). In Canada, a year after we reported Birarda to Vancouver Whitecaps and Canada Soccer, Birarda was fired for sexual misconduct, yet it was announced publicly as a \u201cmutual parting of ways.\u201d Canada Soccer even wished him luck in future endeavors.\nPowerful organizations masked this abusive behavior by these top coaches and both were allowed to waltz effortlessly into new roles in similar spaces within months of being accused of sexual misconduct against players. They both continued to coach vulnerable women and girls. The marginalized survivors of the abuse by these coaches continued to suffer trauma. The coaches were only exposed when survivors took their stories public after the institutions disgracefully failed them.\nIn December 2020, 15 months after I posted my blog, Birarda was criminally charged with nine sex crimes. It has been alleged he abused four victims over a 20-year period. One of the charges relates to an incident in 2008, the year that Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps covered up his termination.\nBefore the stories about Riley were published this week, I was speaking with a journalist who said to me \u201cthe most silent spaces are where the worst secrets are held\u201d. He is right. Without a safe space in soccer to report abuse, countless players have left the game amidst abusive situations. The institutions who fail to take allegations seriously should be held as culpable as the perpetrators. NWSL leadership has rightfully resigned yet management at several league clubs at this time face no consequences.\nIn our case, not one single person from Canada Soccer or the Vancouver Whitecaps, despite a cover up and a coach who was charged with sex crimes, has faced any consequences. Greg Kerfoot still owns the Whitecaps. Rachel Lewis is still the CEO. Victor Montagliani, the director of national teams in 2008 whose role oversaw Birarda\u2019s firing and cover up, is now president of Concacaf and a vice president of Fifa. The same Fifa that had the audacity to tweet yesterday how \u201cdeeply concerned they were about the NWSL allegations\u201d.\nHow do we change this?\nFirst, we need to clearly define acceptable behavior and boundaries for coaches. When coaches cause harm, athletes need a safe place to report the abuse. Truly independent third-party investigations need to be conducted. When coaches are fired for any kind of misconduct it needs to be announced publicly. Owners and management need to face consequences, not fail upwards.\nIf I have learned one thing from my experience in this ocean of harm, it is that change will never happen if the organizations and individuals perpetrating abuse aren\u2019t held accountable. It\u2019s time we take our game back and leave a legacy for future players. Sport should be a place for magic and dreams. Not a place to spend years after picking up the pieces.\nCiara McCormack played professional soccer in Denmark, Norway and Australia. She represented the Republic of Ireland from 2008 until 2014.",

The industry has faced the perfect storm as a combination of Brexit and Covid-19 meet an already precarious and low-paid sector. Our recent research into the experiences of hospitality workers in Scotland, both before and during the pandemic (and similar findings in Ireland), point to a significant increase in customer aggression and abuse aimed at the workforce, with little or no management intervention. In these circumstances, is it surprising that hospitality is facing these\u00a0staffing\u00a0issues?\nTherefore, it is disappointing that the council will bring together sector leaders and associations but, unless I read your report incorrectly, will not include employee representatives.

She said police forces must commit to a much tougher line on misogyny among officers.\n\u201cWhen you can see social media groups with who is on it, what the comments are and who said what \u2013 in any other private business you would be out the door that afternoon.\u201d\nCYW said there should be a review into the \u201capparent culture of misogyny in the police, the sharing of images of victims, and why a serving police officer [reportedly] nicknamed \u2018the rapist\u2019 by his fellow officers was not investigated for inappropriate behaviour\u201d.\nThe group\u2019s statement was backed by the Tory chair of the Commons\u2019 women and equalities committee, Caroline Nokes, who also criticised the Tory chair Oliver Dowden after he said it was \u201ccrass\u201d to refer to male privilege.\nNokes said the CYW statement gave \u201cproactive suggestions to help rebuild trust in the police and address some of the underlying issues about male violence against women.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to not just focus on repeat offenders, but look at the gateway offences, and crack down on them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the government is serious, it needs to act now, not use day one of the conference to deny male privilege exists.\u201d\nThe foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is minister for women and equalities, declined at a Telegraph fringe event to say the Met was institutionally misogynist. \u201cBut I do think we need a change of culture in the police, where there have been appalling failings,\u201d she said.\nSpeaking earlier, Boris Johnson rejected calls for a public inquiry into the police\u2019s failings on sexual violence and in the Everard case, saying investigations by the Met and the Independent Office for Police Conduct should be allowed to happen first.",

As a significant number are believed to be undocumented, it is impossible to know how many are qualified HGV drivers.\nBut Qirko, who had just spent an hour queueing for petrol without success, said he believed many Albanians in Britain were truck drivers who could help make up a shortfall estimated at up to 100,000.\nHe said: \u201cThe Albanians are ready to work for the British government to overcome this problem free of charge. I don\u2019t know if they have the right licences, but if they did I\u2019m sure everyone here would say \u2018I can help\u2019.\nQirko cited the 1999 Nato intervention in Kosovo for saving hundreds of ethnic Albanians and said: \u201cAlbanians in the UK would work free of charge for this country because of what this country has done for them \u2026 We are grateful forever to the government, and to the army of this country, for what they did for our brothers in Kosovo.\u201d\nAlbania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has hopes of joining the EU but in 2019 France blocked the opening of membership negotiations. In 2017, twice as many Albanians as people of any other nationality were caught as stowaways at UK ports, Home Office figures showed. This year, the home secretary, Priti Patel, signed an agreement to remove Albanian nationals without the right to be in the UK.\nQirko urged the British to see Albanians as an asset rather than a problem, complaining they were too often portrayed as gang members, drug dealers and human traffickers, including by government bodies such as the National Crime Agency.\nHe said: \u201cOf course, there are some people from my community that are involved in criminal activity, but why is it so necessary to mention their nationality? Nationality has nothing to do with criminality. You don\u2019t say someone is a gay or lesbian criminal, so why say there are \u2018Albanian criminals\u2019?\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBy mentioning the nationality you create a negative perception, regarding the whole community here that is doing an honest job. Albanians who come here are not criminal. They are people who like a better life.\u201d\nIn 2019, Qirko criticised the Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James for her portrayal of Albanians in her novel The Mister, about a London maid who had been trafficked. Qirko has a copy of James\u2019s letter in response on his desk. She wrote: \u201cIn the course of my research for the novel, I did visit Albania and found it to be an extremely beautiful country. And its people to be warm and welcoming.\u201d\nQirko said: \u201cI\u2019m here to stand up for my people. They are not criminal, they are hard-working and honest.\u201d\nThe military is set to start delivering fuel to forecourts on Monday, amid reports that south-east England is experiencing worsening shortages. Petrol prices are rising, with one garage in London reportedly charging \u00a32.93 for a litre of super unleaded.\nQirko strongly denied reports on Sunday that Albania was negotiating a deal with the UK to receive migrants who cross the Channel in small boats. The Sun said officials were close to striking a deal on an overseas processing centre. Setting up such a centre for refugees is part of the new nationality and borders bill.\nThe Home Office did not confirm or deny the report. But Qirko said there had been no negotiations. \u201cThis is absolutely and totally fake news. Totally false. There are no discussions and no negotiations. I am sure that the Home Office will react and deny this story.\u201d\nOlta Xha\u00e7ka, Albania\u2019s foreign minister, has also denied the report. \u201cSo embarrassing the fake news spreading in the British media about an \u2018offshore hub in the Balkans\u2019 namely in Albania to \u2018detain migrants crossing Channel from France\u2019,\u201d she tweeted.",

        "content": "Washington state congresswoman has become key figure in the rise of the progressives during Biden\u2019s presidency\nIt seemed a throwaway line during a media scrum on Friday outside the House of Representatives. But no other comment by Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), highlighted her group\u2019s growing prominence and leverage in Capitol Hill politics: \u201cIn the House,\u201d she said, \u201ceverybody is a Joe Manchin.\u201d\nThe Democratic Washington state congresswoman\u2019s point, as the delicate cat-and-mouse game with centrist Democrats over the fate of Joe Biden\u2019s flagship domestic agenda, was clear. West Virginia senator Manchin and his fellow holdout Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona might hold the cards in the 50-50 US Senate, but in the lower chamber at least the progressives were in the driving seat.\nThat dynamic is set to play out for the month of October now as the fate of Biden\u2019s political ambitions has been suspended for further talks as the president seeks to reconcile warring factions of his party, especially the recalcitrant Senate centrists who have been stunned by progressive strength \u2013 with Jayapal at the tip of their spear.\nAcknowledging that her party held the House by only a small margin, Jayapal noted that every member wielded make-or-break powers. And by flexing their muscles and forcing House speaker Nancy Pelosi to push back a planned vote on the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, the group was signaling it was no longer on the fringe of the Democratic caucus, but front and center, guiding its direction.\nJayapal, who was born in India and immigrated to the US four decades ago at the age of 16, has been a key architect in the rise of the progressives during Biden\u2019s presidency. The unofficial coach to the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of neoteric young women elected to Congress in 2018, including its most prominent members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, she has spent much of the summer defending the administration\u2019s ambitious infrastructure and social agendas.\nAt the same time she made it clear that the 96-member CPC would hold firm in the face of pressure from Manchin and other Senate and House moderates to reduce the price tag of the agenda, as proved when Thursday\u2019s vote was delayed. It is that tenacity that has helped her emerge as a key player in the infrastructure and $3.5tn social package negotiations, and by extension an influential figure in the future successes or failures of Biden\u2019s wider manifesto.\nShe said on Friday she had been in almost constant contact with the White House and Democratic congressional leaders.\n\u201cWe are making sure we\u2019re holding up the women who need childcare, the families who need childcare, unpaid leave, the folks who need climate change addressed, housing, immigration,\u201d she told reporters.\n\u201cThere\u2019s sometimes frustration, but we\u2019re all part of the Democratic party, this is the Democratic agenda, it\u2019s the president\u2019s agenda and we\u2019re excited to be fighting for the same thing. I\u2019ve been here four and a half years. I still find it strange, but things only happen here when there\u2019s urgency and some reason for people to be at the table. We\u2019ve seen more progress in the last 48 hours than we have seen in a long time.\u201d\nJayapal\u2019s supporters credit her communication skills combined with a hard-nosed determination for maneuvering her caucus into its new authoritative role. She told reporters last week that her message for anybody doubting that the group would block the infrastructure bill unless the social package passed was: \u201cTry us.\u201d\n\u201cPramila has turned the CPC into a strong political force by keeping everyone informed, having people talk through the issues and then make real commitments,\u201d the Massachusetts senator and fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren told the New Republic.\n\u201cThat force is now being felt when the leadership promised that all the pieces would move together. The CPC is holding that leadership accountable.\u201d",

        "content": "Pandora papers reveal Andrej Babi\u0161 financed purchase via secret loans through three overseas firms\nAndrej Babi\u0161, the billionaire Czech prime minister, is under pressure to explain a convoluted offshore structure he used to finance his purchase of a \u00a313m mansion in the south of France.\nThe disclosure that Babi\u0161 controls a group of overseas companies comes as he contests a general election in the Czech Republic this week \u2013 and represents the latest embarrassing turn for a former oligarch who entered politics promising to fight corruption. Babi\u0161 is the second-richest man in the Czech Republic with a net worth of \u00a32.7bn but his previous business dealings have provoked public protests and an ongoing clash with the EU.\nDetails of the secretive offshore arrangements set up by the prime minister are disclosed in the Pandora papers, the largest ever trove of leaked offshore data. The leaked documents have been shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with the Guardian, the BBC and other media around the world.\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world\u2019s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nThe revelations add to a mounting list of controversies facing the Czech prime minister as he seeks a return to power. In June, Czech police asked for Babi\u0161 to be charged with fraud in the long-running \u201cStork\u2019s Nest\u201d affair, in which he is alleged to have fraudulently obtained \u20ac2m (\u00a31.72m) in EU funds to build a hotel.\nBabi\u0161 has long rejected all allegations of wrongdoing and dismissed the police request as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. But in August the European Commission threatened to suspend payments of EU subsidies to the Czech Republic over suspected conflicts of interest in Babis\u2019s business dealings.\nHis office did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment on his offshore companies, while he refused to talk to a BBC camera crew about his French property when they questioned him on the Czech election campaign trail.\nThe Pandora papers show that in 2009 the then tycoon \u2013 when he had yet to enter politics \u2013 passed \u20ac15m via a succession of secret loans through three overseas companies: from the British Virgin Islands-based Blakey Finance Limited through a business called Boyne Holding LLC in Washington DC to its subsidiary SCP Bigaud in Monaco. According to the leaked documents, he had used the Panamanian law firm Alcogal to create the three companies in the same year.\nOnce the money had made its way through the chain to the company in Monaco, it was used to buy a chateau and neighbouring villa in Mougins, near the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. The property boasts a private cinema, swimming pool, billiard room and wine cellar, as well as a master bedroom with two en suite bathrooms.\nMoving money offshore or using offshore companies to buy property is not illegal and is sometimes done for legitimate reasons of privacy or security. The original source of the funds is unknown, however, as is why Babi\u0161 chose such a complicated structure to finance a purchase he could have made directly. The arrangements did not offer Babi\u0161 any obvious tax benefit, experts said.\nOne Czech tax expert said: \u201c[It] looks like a complicated structure to hide ownership of the companies or property.\u201d\nThe prime minister appears not to have declared the property or the companies to the Czech ministry of justice.\nIn 2012, Babi\u0161 founded his own political party, the populist ANO 2011, and stood for election \u201cto fight corruption and other ills in the country\u2019s political system\u201d. However, he has proved a polarising figure.\nHe served as finance minister in 2014 and became prime minister following the 2017 election, forming a minority government consisting of his ANO party and the Social Democrats (\u010cSSD), which relies on the Communist party (KSCM) to stay in power. Other parties refused to serve in a Babi\u0161-led government because of the charges facing him. ANO has a narrow lead in the latest opinion polls but is coming under pressure from two opposition groupings.\nThe Stork\u2019s Nest scandal, in which he is alleged to have used European Union funds funnelled via his Agrofert agriculture and chemical conglomerate to build Stork\u2019s Nest \u2013 a hotel, restaurant, leisure and conference centre complex situated in the Bohemian countryside about 40 miles (65km) to the south of Prague \u2013 has dogged the majority of Babi\u0161\u2019s time in politics. It has led to the biggest street protests since the 1989 Velvet Revolution and the downfall of communism, and calls for his resignation.\nThe prime minister\u2019s most recent clash with the EU came after he placed the massive Agrofert company in two trust funds. An EU audit found that he retained \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d influence over the holdings. As a result, it said, \u201call grants\u201d awarded to Agrofert since February 2017 violated a conflict-of-interest law.\nBabi\u0161 \u2013 the Slovak-born son of a senior communist official who was Czechoslovakia\u2019s representative to GATT, the precursor to the World Trade Organization in Geneva \u2013 has in the past said that he used private savings from his time in Switzerland to buy the formerly state-owned Agrofert with other partners, according to David Ondr\u00e1\u010dka, a former head of Transparency International in the Czech Republic. Babi\u0161 transformed it into a conglomerate of at least 300 companies in sectors from food to fertility clinics.\nBabi\u0161\u2019s ability to buy publicly owned companies sold off in post-communist privatisations was strengthened by his status as an employee of Petrimex, a state-owned energy company based in Morocco.\nHe may have been further assisted, some observers say, by his alleged role as an informer with the St\u00e1tn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost (StB), the communist-era secret police, believed to have recruited him in 1982, enabling him to work abroad as a state trade representative. Babi\u0161 has contested the assertions, but they have been upheld by a court in his native Slovakia.\nBabi\u0161 has been publicly critical in the past of offshore structures of the type that he appears to have used to buy the French chateau, according to Czech commentators.\nAlbin Sybera, a fellow at Visegrad Insight, said that offshore arrangements could have appealed to Babi\u0161 for several reasons, including a desire for secrecy around his private finances. \u201cIt has many advantages for him,\u201d said Sybera, who said Babi\u0161\u2019s business methods were \u201cruthless\u201d.",

For four years, the actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy entertained TV audiences in Ukraine with his starring role in the sitcom Servant of the People. Zelenskiy played a teacher who, outraged by his country\u2019s chronic corruption, successfully runs for president. In 2019, Zelenskiy made fiction real when he contested Ukraine\u2019s actual presidential election and won.\nOn the campaign trail, Zelenskiy pledged to clean up Ukraine\u2019s oligarch-dominated ruling system. And he railed against politicians such as the wealthy incumbent Petro Poroshenko who hid their assets offshore. The message worked. Zelenskiy won 73% of the vote and now sits in a cavernous office in the capital, Kyiv, decorated with gilded stucco ceilings. Last month, he held talks with Joe Biden in the Oval Office.\nThe Pandora papers, leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and shared with the Guardian as part of a global investigation however, suggest Zelenskiy is rather similar to his predecessors.\nThe leaked documents suggest he had \u2013 or has \u2013 a previously undisclosed stake in an offshore company, which he appears to have secretly transferred to a friend weeks before winning the presidential vote.\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history.

Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nZelenskiy has not commented on the claim despite extensive attempts by the Guardian and its media partners to reach him. His spokesperson Sergiy Nikiforov messaged: \u201cWon\u2019t be an answer.\u201d\nThe files reveal Zelenskiy participated in a sprawling network of offshore companies, co-owned with his longtime friends and TV business partners. They include Serhiy Shefir, who produced Zelensky\u2019s hit shows, and Shefir\u2019s older brother, Borys, who wrote the scripts. Another member of the consortium is Ivan Bakanov, a childhood friend. Bakanov was general director of Zelenskiy\u2019s production studio, Kvartal 95.\nAll are associated with Zelenskiy\u2019s home town in southern Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih. After winning power, Zelenskiy brought these close allies into government. Bakanov became head of Ukraine\u2019s SBU security agency. Zelenskiy made Serhiy Shefir his first assistant, an unpaid role that involves handling the president\u2019s daily schedule. A fourth member of this close-knit group, Andriy Yakovlev, is a film director and Kvartal 95 producer.\nZelenskiy has said these appointments were about personal trust rather than financial cronyism. \u201cI have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time \u2026 They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2020.\nBefore becoming president, Zelenskiy declared some of his private assets. They included cars, property and three of the co-owned offshore companies. One, Film Heritage, which he held jointly with his wife, Olena, a former Kvartal 95 writer, is registered in Belize.\nBut the Pandora papers show further offshore assets that Zelenskiy appears not to have revealed. Film Heritage had a 25% stake in Davegra, a Cyprus holding company. Davegra in turn owns Maltex Multicapital Corp, a previously unknown entity registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Zelenskiy, the Shefir brothers, and Yakovlev each held a 25% stake in Maltex.\nOn 13 March 2019, two weeks before the first round of voting in Ukraine\u2019s election, Zelenskiy gave his quarter stake in Maltex to Serhiy Shefir, documents show. It is unclear if Shefir paid Zelenskiy. Bakanov witnessed this secret transfer and signed the offshore papers.\nRoughly six weeks later, after Zelenskiy\u2019s landslide victory, a lawyer acting for the Kvartal 95 group signed another document. It stipulated that Maltex would continue to pay dividends to Zelenskiy\u2019s Film Heritage, even though it no longer owned any stake in the company. Its main revenue comes from activity in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, according to a Maltex client profile.\nThe Pandora papers do not indicate whether any dividends were ever paid or their size. Nor do they reveal how many payments might have been made. Zelenskiy\u2019s wife, Olena, is now the declared beneficial owner of Film Heritage, meaning any payments since 2019 would have flowed to her.\nThe key document \u2013 dated 24 April 2019 \u2013 says Maltex holds shares in companies that produce and distribute TV films. One reason for setting up Maltex was \u201ctax-efficient accumulation of business profits\u201d; another, it states, was \u201clegal protection\u201d. Borys Sheifir said Bakanov had mostly set up these offshore \u201cfinancial schemes\u201d in order to protect the company from \u201cauthorities and bandits\u201d.\n\u201cSpeaking honestly, I\u2019m not ready to respond to you. It could be that I\u2019m an owner [of Maltex],\u201d Shefir told the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), one of the Pandora papers\u2019 media partners. He said he was trying to divest himself of his offshore interests, but said this was a slow and difficult process. Serhiy Shefir, Bakanov and Yakovlev declined to comment, as did their lawyer.\nThe Maltex revelation is embarrassing for Zelenskiy given his pledge to crack down on those sending wealth overseas. Last month, Ukraine\u2019s parliament passed an anti-oligarch bill. The vote took place a day after unknown assassins tried to kill Shefir. A gunman had opened fire on his car outside Kyiv. He was unharmed, but his driver was wounded. The attempt may have been motivated by opposition to the bill.\nIn a recent opinion piece for the Atlantic Council, Zelenskiy said his ultimate goal as president was to destroy \u201cthe traditional oligarchic order\u201d and to replace it with a \u201cfairer system\u201d. Critics, however, say Zelenskiy has failed to reform the state and embraced the same shadowy ways as his predecessors. EU auditors warned last month that \u201cgrand corruption and state capture\u201d remained widespread in Ukraine.\nSince entering politics Zelenskiy has been dogged by claims he is under the influence of Igor Kolomoisky, a billionaire whose TV channel screened Zelenskiy\u2019s show. During the campaign Zelenskiy\u2019s opponents alleged $41m from Kolomoisky entities found its way between 2012 and 2016 into offshore firms belonging to Zelenskiy and his circle, including Film Heritage.\nThe Pandora papers show that at least some of the details in the scheme alleged by Poroshenko\u2019s party correspond to reality. They show that part of the Kvartal 95 network was managed with help from Fidelity Corporate Services, an offshore consultancy and one of 14 firms whose documents make up the leak. The files show that Zelenskiy and his business partners used companies based in the BVI, Belize and Cyprus.\nThe assets held via these offshore companies are wide-ranging. They include real estate in London. Shefir owns two top-end properties \u2013 a three-bedroom apartment in an Edwardian mansion block in Regent\u2019s Park bought in 2016 for \u00a31.575m, and another three-bedroom flat in nearby Baker Street, opposite the Sherlock Holmes Museum, and purchased for \u00a32.2m, according to Land Registry records.\nMeanwhile, Yakovlev\u2019s BVI company Candlewood Investments owns a luxury flat in a Victorian mansion block in Artillery Row, Westminster. The properties were acquired around the time Zelenskiy\u2019s show was turned into a feature film and recommissioned for a second series. It is unclear if the three flats are let out or used on an occasional basis. A Russian company that bills itself as an \u201cindividual service for high status clients\u201d manages them.\nZelenskiy\u2019s apparent business connections to Russia via Maltex are likely to prove controversial. Poroshenko faced criticism for owning a chocolate factory in Russia at a time when Ukraine was fighting a war against Russian troops and their proxies following the Kremlin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The conflict, in which 14,000 people have died, continues in the east of the country and in the Moscow-backed rebel territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia was previously a major market for Kvartal 95, with Russian TV screening its comedy shows.",

        "content": "The spring tour will offer a true test of whether Australia have regained their place in rugby\u2019s upper echelon\nFlushed with success, the Wallabies are about to leave their protective bubble and venture out into the wide world once again.\nFour consecutive wins for the first time since 2017 \u2013 culminating with Saturday night\u2019s 32-17 victory over Argentina \u2013 secured a creditable second-placed finish behind the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship.\nBut Australia\u2019s unexpected achievement must be put into perspective. That is, they have been the beneficiaries of the greatest home-ground advantage in the code\u2019s history.\nSince the advent of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Dave Rennie\u2019s side have played 12 of 16 Tests on home soil, winning seven, losing three and drawing two. All away games were against the All Blacks, of which they lost three and drew one.\nSignificantly, their four-match winning streak \u2013 against South Africa and Argentina \u2013 played out at Queensland venues.\nNow the Wallabies will embark on the next phase of their quest for redemption, in the form of a first spring tour to the northern hemisphere since 2018.\nThe Tests against Japan, Scotland, England and Wales will tell whether recent success was distorted by home-ground advantage or whether they have truly regained their place among the world\u2019s leading rugby nations.\nSince the Wallabies reached the final of the 2015 World Cup at Twickenham they have won only five of 10 Tests on their spring tour of Europe. This time, though, they travel with the tremendous momentum and self-belief that comes with a remarkable turnaround.\nThe turning point was the recall of Japan-based inside backs Quade Cooper and Samu Kerevi, who have transformed Australia\u2019s back play. Cooper has given the Wallabies composure in the crucial playmaking position, while Kerevi has provided go-forward in the midfield. The Australians will be sweating on Kerevi\u2019s fitness after he sustained an ankle injury on Saturday night.\nBut Cooper and Kerevi could not have performed as effectively without an assertive and abrasive forward pack in front of them. Rennie has worked hard to develop a physical forward pack reminiscent of the Chiefs\u2019 back-to-back winning Super Rugby sides of 2012-13.\nApart from some deficiencies in the lineout, the Wallabies\u2019 pack looks capable of competing with any eight in the world. And the forwards may become even stronger with the possible addition of European-based players Rory Arnold, Will Skelton and Tolu Latu on the spring tour.\nIt has taken Rugby Australia a long time to warm to the idea that the national team needs access to all required players \u2013 overseas and domestic \u2013 to become a major force in world rugby again.\nOne of the emerging stars is winger Andrew Kellaway, who was forced to leave Australia a few years ago. Rennie selected the 25-year-old on the strength of his outstanding form with the Melbourne Rebels on his return from England.\nKellaway has scored eight tries in his debut Test season, including Saturday\u2019s hat-trick against Argentina. He may not be the biggest, strongest or fastest outside back to play for Australia, but he is certainly among the smartest, which explains why he puts himself in try-scoring positions so often.\nWith the ability to play wing, fullback and outside-centre, Kellaway has the potential to become Australia\u2019s equivalent of former All Blacks outside-back Ben Smith.\nImportantly, Rennie seems to be developing an effective coaching combination with Wallabies attack coach Scott Wisemantel, similar to the successful collaboration he enjoyed with former All Blacks mentor Wayne Smith at the Chiefs. Rennie and Wisemantel have developed a game plan based on physicality up front, playing for field position and advantage-line consciousness.\nThat plan worked against Argentina, helping to build a comfortable 32-3 lead inside 57 minutes. However, it must be remembered the Pumas\u2019 preparations were disrupted when six players, including their best performer Pablo Matera, were banned from playing the final fixture after an excursion across the New South Wales border to Byron Bay.\nThe next phase in the development of the tactical approach is for the attack to open up in the last 20 minutes. That certainly did not happen with the Pumas outscoring Australia 14-0 at the back end of the game.\nThe Wallabies\u2019 play became a dog\u2019s breakfast, but that was understandable given the composition of the reserves bench with Rennie giving some fringe players opportunities. Australia finished the game with two hookers on the field, and captain and openside flanker Michael Hooper on the wing.\nWhile the final performance at home this year was far from polished, Rennie is building depth and creating competition for places \u2013 crucial to the future success of the team.\nHe now has the difficult task of selecting just 32 players for the upcoming tour. The question is, after enjoying the comforts of home for so long, will the Wallabies spread their wings and fly when they emerge from their cocoon?",

        "content": "Alleged lover and others linked to Putin have all come into extreme wealth. But is the money really theirs?\nIn September 2003, a secret transaction took place. The location was Monaco, a tax haven associated with the international rich. Specifically, an exclusive block just beneath its lavish casino. An apartment changed hands. A local notary signed the deal. Purchase price: \u20ac3.6m (\u00a33.1m). For this, the buyer got a luxury fourth-floor flat, two parking spaces, a storeroom, and the use of a pool in the Monte Carlo Star complex.\nFrom the balcony the new owner could gaze down on Monaco\u2019s sparkling marina, stuffed during the summer with floating superyachts. Security ensured residents were undisturbed by tourists milling around a mini-garden built on the complex\u2019s roof. There were sounds, too, pleasant ones \u2013 the clatter of helicopters ferrying new arrivals from Nice airport, and the screeching of swifts.\nThe identity of the flat\u2019s buyer was a mystery. The official \u201cpurchaser\u201d was an offshore company listed in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Brockville Development Ltd. Brockville was in turn owned by two further Panama-registered entities \u2013 Sefton Securities and, later, Radnor Investments SA. To outsiders, the arrangements looked a little like a Russian doll, with the ultimate beneficiary nestled under layers.\nThanks to documents in the Pandora papers, the Guardian can identify the flat\u2019s buyer \u2013 a woman, 28 years old in 2003, and at the time unknown. Name: Svetlana Krivonogikh. In the space of a few years, around the turn of the millennium, Krivonogikh became extremely wealthy. She acquired a flat in a prestigious compound in her home city of St Petersburg, properties in Moscow, a yacht, and other assets, worth an estimated $100m.\nHow to explain her fairytale rise? According to media reports, Krivonogikh\u2019s background is modest. She grew up in a communal apartment, sharing a kitchen and bathroom with five families.\nKrivonogikh was a business student and worked as a cleaner in a store. Then, in the late 1990s, she appears to have acquired a benefactor: Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world\u2019s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nIn 2020, the investigative website Proekt \u2013 one of Russia\u2019s few remaining independent media outlets \u2013 claimed Krivonogikh formed a friendship with Putin when he was St Petersburg\u2019s deputy mayor. She became Putin\u2019s lover, it alleged.\nRegardless of the exact nature of their relationship, they seem to have been close. The scant public evidence indicates they travelled together on the same planes, for example, as Putin climbed towards power. In 1998, he became the FSB spy agency chief, then prime minister, and in 2000, president as Boris Yeltsin\u2019s successor.\nThree years later, in March 2003, Krivonogikh gave birth to a daughter, Elizaveta, or Luiza. Proekt has claimed Putin is Luiza\u2019s father.\nThe Kremlin has not commented. Putin does not discuss his private life. He and his wife, Lyudmila \u2013 who have two daughters, Masha and Katerina \u2013 divorced in 2013.\nAfter the Proekt scoop was published Luiza took part in social media chat forums. Her Instagram features images of parties, friends from influential families, and trips on private jets. Luiza has always dodged questions about Putin. She and her mother did not respond to questions from the Guardian.\nPolitical figures are entitled to a private life. But the Krivonogikh story is not merely about an alleged romance that fizzled out some time ago. Rather it is about money, and how, according to the Pandora papers, some of Putin\u2019s inner circle used Monaco as a discreet hub for their financial affairs. There is geopolitics, too. Prince Albert, Monaco\u2019s ruler, has good relations with Putin.\nOver the past two decades, Russian influence in Monaco has grown. \u201cIt has become Moscow-on-Sea. The mentality is to show off,\u201d said Dominique Anastasi, a local lawyer. Foreigners including rich Russians were attracted by the warm climate and the lack of tax, he said. \u201cNobody asks where your money comes from. There\u2019s no culture of checking. You don\u2019t make a tax declaration.\u201d\nThe secret flat transaction is also a tale of modern Russia: how a tightly knit group of ambitious KGB officers turned to a tax haven to help enrich themselves \u2013 spies who came in from the cold, in John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s phrase.\nWalk up past the casino and the five-star H\u00f4tel de Paris, with its Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis, and you reach Rue de Lilas. At numbers four to six are the offices of Moores Rowland. A professional accountancy and tax firm, it is connected to a network of law companies and offshore service providers around the world. There is little to be seen from outside other than a pleasant roof garden.\nThe firm has a British managing director, Eamonn McGregor. Documents show it was McGregor who set up Brockville Development Ltd, Krivonogikh\u2019s BVI company.\nIt is unclear how he became the accountant. His biography offers few clues. The son of a police constable, McGregor was born in 1950 in the seaside town of Southport, Merseyside. He trained in Liverpool, working for Littlewoods Mail Order Stores, and joined Moores Rowland in 1978. An expert on tax policy, he speaks French and Italian. In 1998, Prince Rainier, the then monarch, made McGregor a knight and Chevalier in the order of St Charles.\nThe Pandora papers reveal McGregor\u2019s wealthy Monaco clients. They include Gennady Timchenko, a one-time Soviet bureaucrat. Forbes estimates Timchenko\u2019s fortune at $22bn (\u00a316.3bn). McGregor has looked after his family and business assets for at least 20 years. Among them are jets and a 40-metre pleasure yacht, the M/S Lena, named after Timchenko\u2019s wife.\nTimchenko and Putin have been friends since at least the early 1990s when the former was a St Petersburg oil trader and the latter a rising politician. In 1991, Putin \u2013 then head of the city\u2019s foreign relations committee \u2013 gave Timchenko an oil export licence. \nTimchenko went on to co-found Gunvor, a Swiss-based trading house that exports Russian oil, some billions of dollars-worth. The question of who exactly benefits from Gunvor is contested. In 2007, the Moscow political scientist Stanislav Belkovsky alleged Putin was a beneficiary of the company\u2019s activities \u2013 in effect a sleeping co-owner \u2013 something Gunvor says is \u201cridiculous\u201d. It denies he has \u2013 or ever had \u2013 an interest. Putin has said Timchenko\u2019s rise \u201cwas absolutely without my participation\u201d. In 2014, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Timchenko, together with other members of the \u201cRussian leadership\u2019s inner circle\u201d. All acted on behalf of Putin, it alleged, who was described as a \u201csenior Russian government official\u201d. The US treasury department said: \u201cTimchenko\u2019s activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin. Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds.\u201d\nMoores Rowland says it cannot discuss its clients because of a \u201cstrict duty of confidence\u201d. It says that at all times it complies with \u201call applicable laws and regulations\u201d. And that customers are taken on \u2013 or \u201conboarded\u201d \u2013 following \u201crigorous\u201d checks. Moores Rowland is in contact with regulators in Monaco and beyond and follows guidance and advice whenever necessary, it adds. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing and there is nothing illegal or improper about setting up offshore companies.\nBut the Pandora papers do show how the firm assists well-off individuals, some of them subject to US sanctions, to hide their beneficial ownership. There are also questions remaining around exactly what due diligence it carries out on the sources of clients\u2019 wealth. And whether the regulatory regimes where it operates are fit for purpose. Its glossy brochure says \u201cmaintaining confidentiality and minimising tax burdens\u201d is key to the service it provides.\nThe company\u2019s methods were certainly ingenious.\nNormally a customer would buy a personalised offshore firm. From 2002, however, Moores Rowland started using an innovative new system. It employed a small group of in-house offshore companies, fronted by nominee directors. These were used to maintain the assets of different clients.\nThus, a single corporate structure, Radnor Investments, held Timchenko\u2019s yacht, Krivonogikh\u2019s flat and much else. Radnor had shares in another entity, Roxlane Corporate. Roxlane Corporate then signed a so-called \u201cbare trust agreement\u201d with Timchenko, permitting him to use his own yacht.\nIn maze-like fashion, the names of high-value customers vanished from the public record. Legally.\nMoores Rowland also set up a corporate account for Krivonogikh with a private bank in Zurich, EFG. The records do not show how much cash the account may have contained. McGregor continued to render professional help to Krivonogikh; in 2015, for example, sending letters to EFG promising to inform the bank of any change of ownership.\nThe leak sheds light on these compartmentalised arrangements. And it raises questions over whether Putin may personally profit from Russia\u2019s oil transfer trade, as the US alleges.\nTimchenko went into business with two partners from Leningrad. The Pandora papers show all three were registered as owners of International Petroleum Products (IPP), a private company with its roots in the Soviet era. Moores Rowland managed IPP. Lawyers for Timchenko say he has always acted \u201centirely lawfully throughout his career and business dealings\u201d.\nBy the time Putin became president, this partnership was beginning to crack. The Leningrad trio fell out, and in October 2003 they all resigned from the company, documents show. The same day a new director replaced them. His name was Petr Kolbin. He had few qualifications for the role. Except perhaps for one: he was an old family friend of Putin.\nIn December 1941, Viktor Kolbin was wounded while fighting the Germans on the Leningrad front. It was bitterly cold. As he recalled decades later, Kolbin was unable to move and badly hurt, his blood staining the snow. A medic dragged him away. He lived through the great patriotic war, as Russians call the second world war, and later became a teacher and director of a village school in Imenitsy, not far from Estonia.\nIn the summer of 1954, a family from Leningrad rented a room in the village from Kolbin\u2019s aunt. They were the Putins. Kolbin got on well with the Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin, who had also been wounded while fighting near Leningrad. Both men had survived the Nazi blockade of the city, in which so many perished. \u201cWe found a common language,\u201d Kolbin told his local Pravda Severa newspaper in 2002. The Putins brought their two-year-old with them \u2013 a little boy, also Vladimir.\nKolbin\u2019s son Petr and the young Vladimir became friends. In 1969 \u2013 when Petr was 17 and Vladimir 16 \u2013 the two teenagers went off to a dance in the neighbouring village. According to Viktor Kolbin, they got into a fight with some local boys, returning home late with bruises and a cracked lip. Putin began to learn judo. He wanted to join the KGB, an agency celebrated in Soviet films.\nThe two men\u2019s lives diverged. Kolbin worked in a butcher\u2019s shop. But Putin never forget the Kolbins. Soon after taking power, the president sent a letter to Viktor congratulating him on his birthday. In an interview, Kolbin Sr said his son was in touch with Putin and maybe worked for him. \u201cHe [Petr] doesn\u2019t tell me about it. He says: \u2018Daddy, don\u2019t clog your brains with what you don\u2019t need to know,\u2019\u201d Kolbin recalled.\nIn 2001, Petr Kolbin went into business and prospered. A subsidiary of a Kolbin company supplied equipment to Gazprom. Another Kolbin enterprise, Surguteks, became the main exporter for Surgutneftegas, Russia\u2019s fourth-biggest oil concern. Kolbin joined Timchenko as a partner in various ventures, including IPP and Gunvor, where he acquired a 10% stake.\nThe money flooded in. Moores Rowland records show Kolbin opened a Swiss bank account, set up in May 2002 with Vontobel bank in Zurich. It was registered in the name of a Panamanian shell company, Insize Industries SA. A week later, Dmitry Gorelov, a KGB officer who knew Putin from the 1980s, when they were stationed in Dresden, became a second signatory. In 2006, Kolbin and Gorelov opened a second account with HSBC Singapore.\nKolbin\u2019s riches eventually grew to $550m.\nBut was this money actually his? According to the Russian journalist Roman Shleynov, who in 2012 spoke to Kolbin, Putin\u2019s friend led a modest life. \u201cHe was a regular guy from St Petersburg. He drove a Toyota. He flew Aeroflot. He had a small dog. He told me himself: \u2018I am no businessman.\u2019\u201d Shleynov added: \u201cKolbin had a telephone with him at all times. Senior \u2018comrades\u2019 would ring him. They told him what to sign.\u201d\nFor a long time Kolbin operated in the shadows. Then, in 2012, the Russian newspaper Vedomosti outed him as Gunvor\u2019s third co-owner, together with Timchenko and its Swedish chief executive, Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist. When the US imposed sanctions on Timchenko in 2014, IPP \u2013 by this point known as LTS Holdings \u2013 was transferred to Kolbin, the documents suggest. Gunvor says Timchenko had \u201cfully and irrevocably\u201d divested from the firm at this stage. It says he now has \u201cabsolutely no involvement\u201d. Kolbin\u2019s family link to Putin emerged in 2016, when the TV station Rain went to Kolbin\u2019s Leningrad region village and talked to his neighbours. According to Forbes, Kolbin died in 2018.\nThe opposition leader Alexei Navalny \u2013 now in jail, having been poisoned last year in Siberia \u2013 has claimed Gunvor belongs to Putin, the world\u2019s \u201crichest man\u201d. Gunvor vehemently denies this.\nOthers, including the campaigner Bill Browder, have alleged the president uses a variety of proxies. \u201cPutin is smart. You can\u2019t expect to find an account in his name,\u201d said Navalny\u2019s deputy, Leonid Volkov. \u201cBut if you see \u2018Kolbin\u2019 you can be sure as hell this is Putin\u2019s money.\u201d\nIn 2006, Putin was seen swooshing down the snow in dark glasses. He had come to the launch of his favourite ski resort, Igora. Named after a local lake, it is not far from the Ozero community, 60 miles north of St Petersburg, where in the 1990s Putin and his circle built themselves comfortable homes.\nOne Ozera member was Yuri Kovalchuk, the biggest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, a St Petersburg bank founded in 1990 with Communist party funds. When Putin became president, its balance sheet ballooned. Billions flowed into its accounts. The White House alleges Bank Rossiya belongs to the Ozero group. It has labelled Kovalchuk Putin\u2019s \u201cpersonal banker\u201d.\nKovalchuk\u2019s other assets include the Igora resort, which belongs to a company called Ozon LLC. Kovalchuk has a 25% share. The other 75% is owned by Lowbrook Trading, a firm registered in Cyprus. In 2016, the Panama papers shed light on these opaque matters. Between 2009 and 2011, Ozon received \u00a38m in three unsecured loans. The cash came from an offshore company, Sandalwood Continental, which was linked to another of Putin\u2019s old friends, the cellist Sergei Roldugin.\nIn 2020, Proekt identified Krivonogikh as Igora\u2019s other hidden owner. There seems to be little doubt Putin is fond of the resort. According to Reuters, it was the venue in 2013 for the wedding of the president\u2019s daughter Katerina to Kirill Shamalov, the son of another old friend of Putin, Nikolai Shamalov. Shamalov is a Bank Rossiya shareholder.\nSo, it turns out, is Krivonogikh. By 2007, her company Relax owned 3.6% of the bank, according to public records; this later dropped to 2.8%.\nThe enrichment of Putin\u2019s cronies began during his first Kremlin term, a time when the president was publicly declaring war against oligarchs. He railed against businessmen who made their fortunes in the 1990s and who considered themselves \u2013 as Putin put it \u2013 to be gods. In recent years, Putin has complained about unpatriotic tycoons who hide their money offshore.\nKrivonogikh\u2019s Monte Carlo apartment, it seems, is part of a much bigger shadow portfolio. Where the cash came from to fund the purchase is uncertain. Nor do we understand how Krivonogikh became a Moores Rowland customer. Or if the firm was aware of her political connections in Moscow. Roldugin, Gorelov, Kovalchuk and Bank Rossiya all declined to comment.\nBut the big picture revealed by the Pandora papers is stark enough. Putin did not tame the oligarchs. Instead, the leak indicates the existence of a new feudal system, where his friends and KGB associates have been the principal beneficiaries. Some acquired huge paper fortunes of their own. The suspicion is this wealth is ultimately not theirs.\nBack at the Monte Carlo Star, nobody was able to explain whether Krivonogikh lived in the property. The concierge said her name was not listed. A woman who opened the door at her flat denied knowing her. Nearby, residents were sunbathing by the pool. The building, with its maroon corridors, looks a little jaded. Since it was constructed Monaco\u2019s new yacht club has sprung up, part blocking out the once bright sea view.\nSupport independent investigative Guardian journalism\nMake a contribution from just \u00a31\nBecome a digital subscriber and get something in return for your money\nJoin as a Patron to fund us at a higher level",

        "content": "As emails loom omnipresent in our connected lives, is the quest for an empty inbox a noble pursuit or an unwinnable war?\nLast week, I asked my Twitter followers about their email inboxes.\nAuthor Mohammed Massoud Morsi likened his to a \u201cKalashnikov on semi-automatic\u2026Nudge, Nudge, Nudge. Nudge. Nudge, Nudge.\u201d Human rights lawyer Diana Sayed replied that hers functions as a to-do list that is emptied on the regular. And when editor Caitlin Chang revealed that her inbox is sitting at over 1,000 and counting (she says she only ever reads the ones at the top, as they\u2019re probably the most important), someone\u2019s response to her was, \u201cI threw up a little in my mouth\u201d.\nIt\u2019s often the big things in life \u2013 politics, money, religion \u2013 that are polarising. They elicit heated, passionate responses, and everyone believes their way is the right way.\nThe subject of email inboxes can do much the same, and given their looming, constant presence in our lives, the right way to manage them is arguably as contentious as all the above \u2013 which kind of explains the obsession with Inbox Zero.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar, let me explain: Inbox Zero is a term that was coined in the early noughties by \u201clifestyle guru\u201d Merlin Mann, who blogged about his rigorous approach to email management \u2013 all about keeping the inbox at zero unread emails \u2013 on his website 43folders.com. It was grounded in his pursuit for productivity: it wasn\u2019t about the number of emails in an inbox, he said, but how much time our brains spent in that inbox.\nBack then, Mann identified five possible actions to take for each message: delete, delegate, respond, defer and do. His approach, which became exceptionally popular, was called \u201crevolutionary\u201d by the New Yorker. And almost two decades later, it\u2019s still a hot topic of conversation.\nDr David Glance, director of the Centre of Software Practice at the University of Western Australia, isn\u2019t surprised. He says there\u2019s a tension between the seemingly endless storage capacities of email systems (designed that way so that the companies behind them could harvest our data) and the \u201ccognitive load\u201d that we encounter when we see ticking numbers in our inbox \u2013 something that is \u201cworsened\u201d by the constant access we have to email on smart phones and watches.\n\u201cEach buzz sets off hormonal changes that add to the stress levels,\u201d he explains. \u201cAn inbox with more than 20 emails becomes unmanageable. Along with all of the other communication channels, this becomes overwhelming very quickly, especially in times of high stress.\u201d\nWriter and mother of two Natalia Figueroa Barroso became an Inbox Zero convert after losing an important essay as a university student. The loss of the email compounded her existing anxiety and became a catalyst for a more thorough management of her inbox.\n\u201cI\u2019m meticulously organised,\u201d she says. \u201cZero emails in my inbox and folders to sort receipts, poems, short stories, scripts, ideas, urgent [things] etc. I\u2019m a little compulsive about emails, [and] I married a man who\u2019s the complete opposite. It\u2019s painful to see his email icon on his phone.\u201d\nFigueroa Barroso is presently working through 28 emails in her inbox \u2013 most relate to a project she\u2019s currently editing \u2013 but her husband has in excess of 40,000 in his. He stopped letting her go through it in 2019, when she had a \u201cmini panic attack\u201d over important things lost among \u201chot deal promotions and bitcoin spam\u201d.\nPsychologist Dr Jo Lukins says email is the digital equivalent of clutter, \u201ca constant uncontrollable source of information and tasks [that] can negatively impact our physiology and increase our stress levels\u201d.\nShe says one of the biggest challenges with our email inboxes is that others dictate the delivery of messages, making us passive users of a critical work tool.\n\u201cA full inbox is a constant reminder of what we have not done and can impact our sense of accomplishment,\u201d Lukins says. \u201cInbox Zero is a powerful strategy we can implement to increase our sense of control about our workflow. Each time we achieve a task, we receive a hit of dopamine that is physically reinforcing, and [we] feel the psychological relief of achievement.\u201d\nLike Glance, who says Inbox Zero works because the rules are simple (\u201cdon\u2019t have anything in your inbox\u201d), Lukins believes that working towards Inbox Zero \u2013 something she has maintained since January 2020 \u2013 is a noble pursuit.\nSo how does one do it?\nLukins advises beginning with a timeframe and working backwards from that, identifying what you will consider current. From there, she suggests either \u201cbeing brave and deleting everything before that date\u201d or placing in a separate folder marked by that date, only deleting them if you\u2019ve still not retrieved them months later.\n\u201cSet aside a time to delete the inbox according to a strategy for actioning emails that suits,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe three options I have with an email is: action, delete, task. The \u2018action\u2019 emails are those that I will deal with straight away. The \u2018delete\u2019 emails are those that I get rid of immediately [while considering if it\u2019s] a source that I can unsubscribe from. The \u2018task\u2019 emails are tasks that I am unable to complete in a short period. These emails then get placed on to my \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 list \u2026 on a notebook adjacent to my computer.\u201d\nShe suggests determining a timeframe for maintaining that goal inbox, asking yourself what success will look like for you. Will you work on your inbox daily? Weekly? At what time?\nBut psychologist Jocelyn Brewer says the pursuit of Inbox Zero equates success and productivity to a neat and tidy inbox, which is not always viable because our brains weren\u2019t designed to deal with the volume of information that emails expose us to.\n\u201cEmail is a zombie that keeps rising from the dead,\u201d she says. \u201cIts \u2018serve and return\u2019 nature means that you can almost never get \u2018on top\u2019 of it, so it can make you feel like you are battling an unwinnable war.\u201d\nShe advocates instead for something she calls Inbox Manageable, which she says is a combination of working with our psychology and neurology better to improve the way we communicate and the systems that we use to communicate with.\n\u201cFew of us ever got formal lessons in how to use email \u2018properly\u2019 so we have it bouncing around for all sorts of reasons, often unnecessarily,\u201d she explains.\nShe advises setting up clearer expectations around its purpose (\u201cnot a chat system; not a team brainstorm; not a meeting request system\u201d) without simply moving to other platforms, which often just add other places with which to keep up to date.\nMann now believes that taking Inbox Zero a little too literally is actually detrimental to your time, because we have more inboxes than ever: on multiple social media platforms, email inboxes for work and personal use, and on applications like Slack, Teams and Hangouts. Spending time going through all of them would leave very little time for us to actually live our lives.\nTime we might use, perhaps, to argue about the other big things, like politics, religion and money.",

        "content": "Disability royal commission calls rollout \u2018seriously deficient\u2019 and warns against opening up before everyone\u2019s had a chance to be vaccinated\nDavid Moody\u2019s phone wouldn\u2019t stop ringing. And everyone had the same problem.\n\u201cWe started to get calls saying, \u2018When are these guys showing up\u2019?\u201d says Moody, who was until June the chief executive of a peak body for national disability insurance scheme providers. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that was the cry from providers for the next three months after. \u2018When are they coming?\u2019 It was clear something wasn\u2019t working.\u201d\nIt was the middle of March, a few months after the federal government promised the 27,000 people with disability who live in shared accommodation they would be at the front of the vaccine queue.\nThe plan was for \u201cin-reach\u201d teams contracted by the government to go into the so-called \u201cgroup homes\u201d, as well as aged care facilities, and vaccinate the residents. And it was already supposed to have started.\nWhat Moody\u2019s former employer, National Disability Services, and, more importantly, the disability community, didn\u2019t know was the plan had already changed. Dramatically.\nThe government had, according to a bombshell royal commission report released on Monday, \u201cde-prioritised\u201d this group in favour of aged care residents, who\u2019d been ravaged by Covid in 2020.\nIt then left people with disabilities, their advocates and providers in the dark about the decision until a Senate hearing six weeks later on 20 April 2021.\n\u201cI was absolutely livid,\u201d Moody says. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting the government isn\u2019t entitled to make new decisions, but we were never consulted or advised.\n\u201cWe\u2019d had meetings with the then minister Stuart Robert in regards to those issues. All I can say is we did not appreciate being blindsided.\u201d\nFive months on, with major outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne, the nation\u2019s two largest states will end lockdowns this month when double-dose rates hit 70%.\nWhile aged care and disability care residents were slated to enjoy the same priority access to the vaccine, the gap is stark.\nSome 90% of aged care residents have received one dose. Among disability group home residents, 67.5% are fully vaccinated, and 75.9% have gotten one jab. It means nearly a quarter remain unprotected.\nData obtained from the government reveals that coverage is patchy between states. In New South Wales, which is set to lift the lockdown on 11 October, 67.8% of disability group home residents are fully vaccinated. The figure is 75.6% in Victoria, but worryingly low in Queensland (51.6%) and the Northern Territory (53.2%).\nRates are better in Western Australia (64.9%), South Australia (63.3%) and Tasmania (67.1%).\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to see the state of the rollout right now, particularly as we move into this critical moment,\u201d says the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, who lives with cerebral palsy. \u201cThe health measures particularly in NSW and Victoria are changing. It is more important than ever that disabled people are vaccinated.\u201d\nWhen the disability royal commission took the unusual step of releasing a draft report into the federal government\u2019s vaccine rollout on Monday, it was aimed at maximum impact.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a desperate cry for help,\u201d says Labor\u2019s NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s in their mind, but it\u2019s the royal commission sending out an emergency flare.\u201d\nThe scathing report labelled the rollout \u201cseriously deficient\u201d, warned governments against opening up at 70% if all people with disability hadn\u2019t had the chance to be vaccinated, and pilloried the government over its failure to properly consult with the disability community or be transparent about its decisions.\nThe following day the secretary of the Department of Health, Brendan Murphy, was quizzed about the findings.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept there was a de-prioritisation,\u201d said Murphy, who instead called it a \u201crefocusing on residential aged care\u201d.\n\u201cThat has probably saved over a thousand lives in aged care, because all of our advice was that was the highest-risk population.\u201d\nSamantha Connor, the president of People With Disability Australia, was not impressed by Murphy\u2019s response.\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the people that\u2019s at risk of dying of Covid,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a combination of rage and sadness and despair and despondency.\u201d\nIn early February, most disability advocates were pleased when the government included people living in group homes in phase 1a of the rollout.\n\u201cWe know from international evidence they are a very at-risk group,\u201d says Prof Anne Kavanagh, a University of Melbourne academic who has a multiple sclerosis diagnosis and a child with autism.\nBut the good news was short-lived. The royal commission\u2019s report suggests the government included disability and aged care in the same priority group without a full appreciation of the major differences between the two sectors.\nWhile nursing homes are often large and may have dozens of residents, NDIS group homes cater to between two and six people, and in rarer cases as many as 10.\nThe report also found Department of Health officials initially factored in that there were about 6,000 residents in disability care, rather than about 27,000.\nBy March, once the government realised the scale of the challenge, faced supply issues and what Murphy this week called the contracted vaccines providers\u2019 \u201climited capacity and limited workforce\u201d, it chose to focus on vaccinating the almost 200,000 aged care residents before winter.\nBut it didn\u2019t let on that there had been a shift in priorities. When the prime minister, Scott Morrison, hailed Australia\u2019s one millionth vaccine dose in April, he noted that already \u201c125,260 doses had been provided to the aged and disability services for the residents\u201d.\nThe data released by the government at the time also didn\u2019t differentiate between aged and disability care.\nIn reality, less than 1% of all doses distributed between 22 February to 21 April 2021 went to people with disability, the royal commission said this week.\n\u201cFor me there is no doubt we needed to vaccinate very quickly aged care residents and workers,\u201d says Kavanagh.\n\u201cBut given the size of the group home cohort, which is not massive, I don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t have been doing both. Or not delayed it as much.\u201d\nJulia Squire is the chief executive of Ability Options, one of the largest NDIS providers in NSW.\nBy April, Squire had seen media reports suggesting her clients, as well as her workers, had been shafted.\n\u201cI just thought it was immoral and inexcusable,\u201d she says.\nAt her wit\u2019s end, Squire wrote to the health minister, Greg Hunt, and the NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, noting \u201cone of our employees received her first Pfizer vaccination alongside the prime minister and is proud to be our local promotor for the vaccine\u201d.\n\u201cTwo months in, we now have, of over 700 people eligible, only [three] employees and 10 \u2026 participants have had the Pfizer vaccine in 1a,\u201d she wrote.\nAs pressure slowly began to mount, the government insisted the rollout would ramp up in late April. But providers say they didn\u2019t notice a change until at least May.\n\u201cIt was completely radio silence from February to \u2026 the last week in May,\u201d says Kate MacRae, chief executive of NDIS provider Able Australia.\n\u201cOn one day in the last week in May, we rang [a government-contracted vaccine provided] 17 times without getting a single return call, and everything went to auto answer system.\u201d\nBy this point, providers, as well as parents and carers, had started taking matters into their own hands.\nOnce the rollout expanded, they organised vaccines for their residents through local GPs and state health departments. Later, some of the larger providers pulled together disability-specific hubs with the government-contracted vaccine providers, Aspen Medical and Healthcare Australia.\nThe figures improved. By July nearly 20% of the 27,000 disability care residents had been fully vaccinated, and this had increased to nearly half by August.\nSquire and MacRae say almost all of their clients have been fully vaccinated now.\nBut the latest data suggests 6,596 people living in group homes have still not received a single jab.\nIt\u2019s acknowledged hesitancy is an issue, but the bigger fear is that the remaining unprotected residents are those who are most vulnerable, unable to leave their home to attend a vaccination hub. That is, those who require a home visit, as was originally planned all along.\nSquire acknowledges that once the plan had been abandoned, a \u201cfree for all\u201d developed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a big organisation,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got organisations like ours that have swallowed up every bit of supply they can find. But that\u2019s got to have an impact on others.\u201d\nWhile those who should have been vaccinated in phase 1a remain unvaccinated, advocates are also raising concerns about the wider disability population.\nThe data obtained by Guardian Australia shows 48.5% of NDIS participants 16 and over have been fully vaccinated, while 33.2% of those aged 12-15 have received one dose.\n\u201cThe target shouldn\u2019t be 80%, it should be 90%, and as close to 100% as you can,\u201d says Kavanagh of people with disabilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m really fearful now we won\u2019t have the vaccination rates among people in both residential settings and also in the community at a time we\u2019re going to be opening up with high caseloads.\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified we\u2019re going to see a pandemic in deaths in unvaccinated disabled people that could have been prevented.\u201d",

        "content": "In 1967, a team led by the radio astronomer Antony Hewish, who has died aged 97, discovered pulsars, rapidly pulsating radio sources that turned out to be due to rotating, magnetised neutron stars, the ultra-dense collapsed remnants of massive stars.\nThis was one of the most exciting astronomical events of the second half of the 20th century: the precise timing of the pulses from these objects is more accurate than the best atomic clocks and has allowed precision tests of general relativity.\nThe team assembled by Hewish \u2013 Jocelyn Bell, John Pilkington, Paul Scott and Robin Collins \u2013 all played a crucial role in the detection and confirmation of the first pulsar, with attention naturally focusing on Bell, the research student who first noticed unusual signals.\nSeven years later, Hewish and Martin Ryle jointly received the Nobel prize for physics, \u201cfor their pioneering work in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular of the aperture synthesis technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the discovery of pulsars\u201d.\nRyle and Hewish\u2019s 1960 invention of aperture synthesis, where the rotation of the Earth is used to convert a line of telescopes into, effectively, a single giant circular antenna, was crucial to the development of radio astronomy. The Very Large Array in New Mexico, the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), the European Low-Frequency Array (Loray), and the Event Horizon Telescope used to map black holes are modern examples of their innovation.\nHewish\u2019s first research was on propagation of radio waves through lumpy transparent media, and he realised in 1952 that the scintillation or twinkling of the recently discovered radio \u201cstars\u201d (actually radio galaxies or quasars) could be used to probe conditions in the ionosphere and the interplanetary medium.\nToday these techniques are used to map large-scale structure in the solar wind. Hewish showed that interplanetary scintillations could be used to make very high-resolution observations of distant objects, equivalent to a telescope with a baseline of 1,000km.\nHe conceived the idea of a huge phased-array antenna with which a major survey of radio galaxies and quasars could be carried out, and secured funds to build one in 1965. Bell joined his team at this time and was given the task of analysing the paper strip-chart records from the array. It took all of them to build the 1.8 hectare (4.5 acre) array with its 1,024-dipole antennae.\nOnce it was commissioned, Hewish asked Bell to create sky charts of each day\u2019s observations. Real astronomical sources would recur at the same position on the sky each day, whereas human-made interference would occur at random. On 6 August 1967 Bell noticed an unusual patch of \u201cscruff\u201d on the charts, which reoccurred from time to time at the same position on the sky.\nHewish decided to improve the time resolution on the recording equipment, and this showed that the source was pulsing every 1.33 seconds. Careful work by the team showed that the source was not an instrumental effect, or due to \u201clittle green men\u201d, but was from a source located at 200 light years away. Bell also discovered three other pulsars. Hewish wrote the results up for publication in Nature, with Bell and the three other authors.\nHis interpretation was that the source had to be either a rotating white dwarf star or a neutron star. The neutron star interpretation was soon confirmed by the discovery of a pulsar with a much shorter period in the Crab Nebula. In an interview, Hewish said that when Stephen Hawking heard the news he rang up to say that if neutron stars existed then black holes were almost certain to occur too.\nBorn in Fowey, Cornwall, the youngest of three sons of Frances (nee Pinch) and Ernest Hewish, a bank manager, Antony grew up in Newquay, where he developed a lifelong love of swimming and boating. The family lived above the bank where his father was manager, and Antony was allowed to set up a laboratory there. One of his early electricity experiments blew the fuse of the entire building. At boarding school \u2013 King\u2019s College, Taunton \u2013 he built a crystal set radio because ordinary radio was not allowed in the dormitory.\nIn 1942, Antony went to the University of Cambridge to study natural sciences. His studies were interrupted from 1943 to 1946 by war work on airborne radar countermeasure devices, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern, which is where he met Ryle.\nReturning to Cambridge in 1946, he graduated two years later and immediately joined Ryle\u2019s research group at the Cavendish laboratory as a research student. After obtaining his PhD in 1952 on the fluctuations of galactic radio waves, Hewish became a research fellow at Gonville and Caius College, and then, in 1961, transferred to Churchill College as director of studies in physics.\nHe became a university lecturer in 1961, reader in 1969, and professor of radio astronomy in 1971, until his retirement in 1989, when he was made emeritus professor at Cambridge. When Ryle became ill in 1977, Hewish took on the leadership of the Cambridge radio astronomy group and was head of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory from 1982 to 1988.\nThe award of the Nobel prize to Hewish and Ryle was immediately controversial, criticised by, among others, Fred Hoyle and Thomas Gold, for the exclusion of Bell, later Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell.\nHewish was undoubtedly the major player in the work that led to the discovery, inventing the scintillation technique in 1952, leading the team that built the array and made the discovery, and providing the interpretation as due to a white dwarf or neutron star. Bell herself was gracious about the matter, saying: \u201cI believe it would demean Nobel prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them.\u201d\nAfter the discovery of pulsars, Hewish continued his work on interplanetary scintillations, and the mapping of the solar wind and the \u201cinterplanetary weather\u201d, which can have a dramatic effect on terrestrial communications.\nAs well as being an honorary member of numerous foreign academies, he was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968, and received the Eddington medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1969 and the Hughes medal of the Royal Society in 1977. A shy, modest man, Hewish declined offers to become master of a Cambridge college.\nHe believed that science and religion were complementary, and that: \u201cWe should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our commonsense understanding.\u201d\nAntony married Marjorie Richards in 1950 and they had a son, Nicholas, and a daughter, Jennifer, who died in 2004.\nMarjorie and Nicholas survive him, as do five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n Antony Hewish, radio astronomer, born 11 May 1924; died 13 September 2021",

The six\u2011stage race will feature many of those who battled through the historic inaugural edition of the women\u2019s \u201cHell of the North\u201d, won by a bloodied and tearful Deignan in Roubaix.\nThe dramatic growth in popularity of women\u2019s cycling, demonstrated by the advent of a women\u2019s Paris-Roubaix and the long-awaited return in 2022 of the women\u2019s Tour de France, will be exemplified this week by the Women\u2019s Tour, which returns after a 28-month absence enforced by the coronavirus pandemic.\nOver the previous six editions the Women\u2019s Tour of Britain has established itself as one of the most prestigious events in women\u2019s racing, with Deignan winning overall in 2016 and also the most recent edition, in 2019. A hat-trick of wins by the 32-year-old, who finished the weekend\u2019s cobbled Classic with bleeding hands, so severe was the vibration from the ruptured roads, would make her one of the most successful British riders in history.\nDeignan\u2019s emotional victory was a moving statement of intent, underlined by the Yorkshirewoman\u2019s powerful words afterwards. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a chance to dream for so long, it\u2019s always been a men\u2019s race,\u201d the leader of the Trek-Segafredo team said. \u201cI am just so proud that this is where we are, that women\u2019s cycling is on the world stage now. I am proud that my daughter can look at the trophy. She doesn\u2019t just have to watch men on the TV any more. We\u2019re here and we\u2019re representing.\u201d\nDeignan added that she was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d that women\u2019s cycling had reached what she called a \u201cturning point\u201d.\n\u201cWe are so grateful to everybody behind the scenes, all the viewers watching, because everybody who is watching this is also making history and it\u2019s proving there is appetite for women\u2019s cycling. The athletes here can do one of the hardest races in the world and I\u2019m so proud I can say I\u2019m the first ever winner.\u201d\nHowever, the cobbles did take their toll on the women\u2019s peloton and there will be several notable absentees from the start line in Bicester on Monday. Among those nursing injuries after crashing on Saturday will be Annemiek van Vleuten, who broke her pelvis in two places after what she described as a \u201cstupid crash\u201d.\nDespite her fall, the former world road race champion carried on racing to Roubaix. \u201cI was just riding to get to the finish, but now I\u2019m really disappointed that I didn\u2019t just get off because I have to pay a high price for this.\u201d\nDeignan\u2019s teammate, the world time trial champion Ellen van Dijk, sustained a concussion after her own crash. \u201cI have to stay calm for a while,\u201d said the Dutch rider, who has been ruled out of the Tour of Britain.\nThere are unlikely to be any days quite as brutal as a muddy Paris\u2011Roubaix in the 2021 Women\u2019s Tour route but the autumn scheduling, rolling terrain and windy, unsettled weather is sure to make for a gruelling week.\nFinishing on Saturday in Felixstowe, the outcome is likely to pivot on Wednesday\u2019s 16.6km time trial stage in Atherstone. In a race route that looks likely to favour sprinters rather than climbers, Deignan is hardly likely to be disadvantaged. Buoyed and empowered by Saturday\u2019s rubicon moment, she will be the rider to watch in the penultimate women\u2019s World Tour race of the season.",

        "content": "Manchester City playmaker gave a reminder of his frightening talent in a meeting with Liverpool that offered endless thrills\nThere was a nice moment at the end of this game. As the players milled around the centre circle drawing a breath, and as Phil Foden went to place a fond arm round the shoulder of James Milner, who had spent the first half trying, and mainly failing, to body-check him into the advert boards, the crowd in the seats and the walkways stopped to give the players a gentle, rippling ovation.\nIt was that kind of afternoon. At kick-off Anfield had been illuminated by soft, autumnal sun at one end, the chill beginning to creep in under a powder-blue sky. What followed was a glorious, ragged, brilliantly high-craft spectacle as the players of Liverpool and Manchester City produced a full-throated hymn to the unkempt beauty of football even at this rarefied level, its rough edges and strange energies.\nThis was a game Manchester City dominated for 45 minutes without ever looking particularly happy about it. Pep Guardiola laid on another stroke of double-take in his selection. Best of all Foden produced a quiet masterclass of sharp-edged attacking midfield play, drifting about with malevolent, twirling intent and reasserting his own wonderful talent after a period of retrenchment.\nIn the process Foden just about bailed his manager out from the repeat charge of mugging his own team \u2013 not just \u201cover-thinking\u201d this wealth of attacking talent but sending it out into battle lassoed in his own strange tactical algebra.\nOn paper City\u2019s team looked almost disappointingly straightforward. Except, as the game kicked off, it soon became clear that Jack Grealish would be the centre forward. Yes: that Jack Grealish. Grealish who doesn\u2019t score many goals, who hasn\u2019t done this before and who had precious little time, with the midweek game, to train for it. But yeah. Anfield. Off you go Jack.\nGrealish as false-ish nine made it three non-centre-forwards in a week for City: Foden, Sterling and Grealish. Gabriel Jesus, who is an actual centre-forward, played as a winger here again. It is no secret that Guardiola wanted a new \u00a3100m centre-forward this summer. This was at least one way of making that happen. But really, Pep? This felt like the footballing equivalent of buying a Montblanc fountain pen and using it to peel carrots.\nAnd so City set off, burning their way through a series of chances. With 16 minutes gone Bernardo Silva conjured a lovely cross to the back post. Where, one wondered, was Grealish, towering Grealish, launching himself above the defence like a rearing buffalo to butt the ball into the net?\nA little later Silva took the ball in midfield and set off on an astonishing, meandering, playground-football run, then played a fine pass to put Foden in on goal. He delayed just too long, moved just too wide. Alisson smothered with his chest. But the ball should have already been zinging into the corner behind his left ear.\nThrough all this Foden had begun to do terrible things to Milner on the City left. He had also excelled against Chelsea last Saturday, in the centre that time, where he was disciplined and neat. This, though, was something else, a re-emergence out on the left of that sublime cutting edge.\nThe last four months have been difficult. Injury hasn\u2019t helped. Perhaps Foden has taken a while to recover from the seasickness around the Champions League final in May. An in-out Euros followed, the wonky optics of the Gazza-rinse.\nHere he looked hungry from the start and agreeably merciless. At first Foden teased Milner, testing the water. Then he ducked inside him. Before long he was shimmying, sashaying, vaulting him like a piece of gym equipment.\nMilner will know he was extremely lucky not to be sent off here for persistent fouling before he left the field on 70 minutes. At times this was like watching an action sequence from a George Romero zombie film: the staggering gait, the clutching arms, grasping helplessly at some fresh-faced fugitive.\nBy half-time City had taken seven shots at goal to Liverpool\u2019s one, dribbled more, passed more, kept the ball 55% of the time.\nLiverpool had been a little passive but they began to press higher up the pitch after the break. They took the lead from that same Foden-Milner side. A neat triangle of passes sent Mohamed Salah racing in behind Silva. He played the perfect through-pass. Sadio Man\u00e9 had time to open his hips and roll the ball into the far corner \u2013 a fine goal and a reminder of Liverpool\u2019s own champion qualities.\nTo their credit City\u2019s players were straight back at it when they might have taken a breath. Jesus set off on a barrelling, skittering run, then found Foden, head up and moving into space on the left. This time the shot was pinged with real feeling back across Alisson and into the far corner.\nSalah produced a wonderful solo goal to put Liverpool ahead again, feinting away from five sky blue shirts before pinging a shot across Ederson. Foden helped make the equaliser, Kyle Walker producing a late audition for next week\u2019s centre-forward slot, leaping over Foden\u2019s cross and allowing Kevin De Bruyne to fire in a deflected shot.\nBoth teams will feel they might have won this game. City\u2019s attack looks like a story that will run on from here. But this was also a kind of reawakening for a player who has a chance now to start stretching up once again towards the outer limits of his own wonderful talent.",

But when her job went fully virtual, she found herself dreading Microsoft Teams meetings. Her face looked rounder, her nose looked bigger, and her top lip looked thinner than she\u2019d ever noticed in the mirror.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought I was attractive, and people would always compliment my looks in person,\u201d she says. \u201cBut on video, nobody was saying how nice it was to see my pretty face.\u201d\nThis past June, Jane took matters into her own hands \u2013 or rather, her lips \u2013 and got her pucker plumped with filler. She was so pleased with the results, she plans to repeat the process every year.\nAs the pandemic corralled the masses into video conferences throughout 2020, researchers noticed a phenomenon they dubbed \u201cZoom dysmorphia\u201d. After months of remote meetings and social gatherings \u2013 and seeing their own faces on screen \u2013 more and more people became fixated on perceived physical flaws.\nShadi Kourosh, a Massachusetts dermatologist, coined the term after her clinic reopened for in-person appointments last summer, when she noticed a huge uptick in consultations for cosmetic procedures such as Botox, injectable fillers, laser resurfacing and chemical peels. She co-authored a study on the trend, which was published last November.\n\u201cWith all the other concerns we had at hand, it was surprising to me how anxious people were about their appearance,\u201d Kourosh says.\nPerhaps even more surprising: Kourosh says that now, with the return to in-person interaction, consultation requests for cosmetic procedures aren\u2019t slowing down.\nIn a follow-up study published in the International Journal of Women\u2019s Dermatology, Kourosh and her colleagues found that 71% of surveyed individuals were anxious about going back to in-person events, and three in 10 had plans to invest in their looks because of it. While these figures may not be solely attributable to Zoom, it\u2019s clear that the age of video conferencing opened up a Pandora\u2019s box of physical insecurity.\nWhile psychological studies have long correlated time spent in front of the mirror with increased insecurity, Kourosh says looking at yourself on a screen is more like looking in a funhouse mirror than an actual one. Front-facing cameras combined with a close focus can distort people\u2019s appearance, making eyes look smaller and noses seem bigger. Plus, people aren\u2019t used to watching themselves looking at other people.\nRight off the bat, Kourosh and others noticed an increase in specific concerns that might be attributable to tech-induced distortions. \u201cPeople were preoccupied by the wrinkles around their eyes, and that may [have been] because they were watching themselves squint at the screen,\u201d she says.\nDoctors who perform cosmetic procedures are used to body dysmorphia exacerbated by retouched celebrity photos or, in recent years, social media filters. But most people are self-aware enough to know a Snapchat filter isn\u2019t real life. Kourosh says Zoom dysmorphia is more insidious because people simply weren\u2019t aware video calls could cause distortion. These types of insecurities also affect a much broader section of society \u2013 not everybody has a Snapchat account, but almost anybody who worked from home during the pandemic used video conferencing.\nThe impact can be profound, and lasting. Like Jane, Dimplez Ijeoma, a Los Angeles-based social strategist and marketing consultant in her 30s, didn\u2019t spend too much time in front of the mirror pre-pandemic. But once she became forced to stare at herself in work-related Zoom meetings up to 40 hours a week, she started to worry about the texture of her skin.\nShort of cosmetic procedures, she tried everything to improve her skin\u2019s appearance \u2013 ring lights, Zoom filters, even a new skincare routine. Blurring her skin helped during the meetings, but she fixated on her appearance after the calls.\n\u201cWhen you look in a mirror after eight hours of a beauty filter on Zoom, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh snap, I have pores,\u2019\u201d she says.\nSome people didn\u2019t have the option to change how they looked on screen. Becky Schwarz, a 27-year-old from Washington who works as an operations manager for a career consulting and personal branding firm, was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease, at the beginning of the pandemic.\nThe condition triggered significant hair loss, and Schwarz says her steroid medication caused her face to swell and appear rounder. All the while, her diagnosis induced depression that made it hard to shower and take care of herself.\n\u201cMy appearance was taking greater and greater hits and the worse I got, the more I was staring at the video of myself on the screen,\u201d Schwartz says.\nTo avoid being seen on camera, Schwarz started telling people her camera was broken or calling in from her phone. When she didn\u2019t have a choice, she hung decor on the wall behind her to distract from her face and kept the room as dark as possible. She still opts out of virtual social gatherings more than she wants to. \u201cZoom has made me want to be invisible, but that is incredibly lonely,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure how to come out the other side of this.\u201d\nAs she returns to in-person events, Schwarz says her social anxiety and body dysmorphia are at an all-time high: \u201cI hate so much the idea of going out places and having people see more than I have learned to control.\u201d\nFor some, video conferencing exacerbated existing body dysmorphia. Sam, a 28-year-old data analyst from Toronto, says he\u2019s experienced intrusive thoughts about his body since his mid-20s, when he started to fixate on perceived flaws about single facial features. \u201cI began constantly stopping at mirrors or reflective surfaces to confirm whether the facial feature actually aligned with my mental image of it,\u201d he says. On Microsoft Teams, he found himself \u201cmirror checking\u201d all day.\nTweaking his webcam angle to hide non-existent imperfections didn\u2019t help, and Teams doesn\u2019t allow users to hide self-view. Sam tried therapy for his body dysmorphia, but ultimately, he decided on a nose job. \u201cI was pleased with the results for a few months but later, the dysmorphia re-emerged, and I found a new flaw in the same facial feature,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m now on the waitlist for a therapist with body dysmorphic disorder expertise.\u201d\nDistressed by the way he looked in Zoom meetings, Chad Teixeira, a 25-year-old entrepreneur from London, booked himself plastic surgery in Turkey on a whim in March. The 10-hour operation, which included liposuction and a tummy tuck, led to a near 90lb weight loss. But Teixeira also lost a dangerous amount of blood during the operation, and he\u2019s had to have two blood transfusions since.\nWhile Teixeira says he feels more confident in calls with colleagues and clients \u2013 and his mental health has improved due to his weight loss \u2013 he says he\u2019d do things differently if he had the chance. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have done something so drastic on a whirlwind if I hadn\u2019t been looking at myself all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cZoom drove me to risk my life for the perfect body.\u201d\nReturning to in-person events feels like a breath of fresh air for Teixeira. But it hasn\u2019t tempered his desire for cosmetic tweaks. He has plans to pursue more liposuction and a \u201cfake six-pack\u201d next.\nJane, on the other hand, has mixed feelings. Her job will be online for the foreseeable future, and because she feels less attractive on screen than in real life, she\u2019s considering a rhinoplasty to improve her confidence. But resolving her anxiety about her physical appearance sparks its own kind of insecurity, she says.\n\u201cIt feels juvenile as a 40-year-old woman to think about my looks like a teenager, because there are bigger problems in the world.\u201d",

Sunak is expected to claim he is \u201cdoubling down\u201d on his 2020 promise to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to support people through the crisis.\nHowever, the government is pressing ahead with its decision to remove the \u00a320-a-week uplift to universal credit despite warnings from charities and campaigners that it will increase poverty.\nMeasures included in the new package will include prioritising those coming off furlough for one-to-one support from jobcentres and extending until 31 January the \u00a33,000 incentive for employers to take on apprentices.\nThe furlough scheme, which supported a cumulative 11.6m jobs during the crisis, came to an end on 30 September. Unions and business groups urged the chancellor not to scrap it, and the jobs package appears to be an attempt to cushion the impact.\nA \u00a3500m hardship scheme announced last week to be administered by local councils to ease the impact of the cost-of-living crisis was branded a \u201csticking plaster\u201d by charities and the Labour party.\nWith a tough spending review coming up on 27 October, Sunak is expected to highlight the government\u2019s plans for investing in infrastructure and skills.\n\u201cWe are going to make this country not just a scientific superpower, not just the best place in the world to do business, I believe we\u2019re going to make the UK the most exciting place on the planet,\u201d he will say.\nThe chancellor used his conference speech last year, when the event was held virtually, to say the Tories have a \u201csacred duty\u201d to repair the public finances.\nThe shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s struggling plan for jobs has failed to hit its original targets; it is not creating the number of jobs needed and has failed to address the supply chain crisis Britain is experiencing.\u201d\nMeanwhile the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, suggested the UK could pursue a more interventionist foreign policy, during her first conference speech on Sunday. She cited a desire to sign more deals akin to the Aukus defence pact with Australia and the US, referencing Japan as an ally where the UK was seeking more military access and operational support.\nTruss said the UK should be an active member of the \u201cnetwork of liberty\u201d pursuing global democratic values. \u201cThe democratic world order faces a stark choice. Either we retreat and retrench in the face of malign actors or we club together and advance the cause of freedom,\u201d she said.\nShe said the west must \u201cwin this battle for economic influence\u201d in developing nations from a \u201cposition of strength\u201d.\nIn a nod to Conservative backbenchers who have rebelled against the government in order to promote a hardline approach towards China, Truss said trade with the superpower was important but added that the UK would be \u201ctough on those who don\u2019t share our values and don\u2019t play by the rules\u201d.\nShe said the UK would \u201creach out to more countries who haven\u2019t historically been aligned to Britain and encourage a freer, more prosperous world\u201d.",

        "content": "The game returned to its true self on the biggest stages in Brisbane on Sunday night as Penrith secured a third premiership\nRugby league, like much of the world, endured a strange and difficult 2021. The pandemic, outside the game\u2019s control, saw the game moved to Queensland and the first grand final take place outside Sydney. Mid-season rule changes and short-lived crackdowns sent the game spinning like a flipped car careening down a cliff. A great grand final can cure all ills though and that is exactly what the game got though with a classic finale that saw Penrith crowned premiers in a 14-12 victory over a gallant South Sydney.\nRugby league\u2019s enduring strength is that the game itself is so brilliant, compelling and brutal that it can overcome the drama, hysteria and incompetence that so often surrounds it. There was no better example of that than Sunday night\u2019s decider that ranks right up there with the finest of the NRL era.\nGreat grand finals are remembered for their defining moments. Cody Walker\u2019s heroic run where he sliced through the Panthers defence with a sharp burst and a vicious fend on his way to a try had him earmarked as a hero. Walker\u2019s intercept pass that saw Penrith winger Stephen Crichton race away to score deep into the second half was the turning point, an all-or-nothing play that was destined to lead to points at one end or the other. Adam Reynolds\u2019 missed sidelined conversion with six minutes remaining, South Sydney\u2019s hopes and dreams sitting on the boot of the club\u2019s greatest ever pointscorer in his final game in the cardinal and myrtle.\nFor Penrith though success was not built on a highlight play but on a rigid discipline and deep patience. Clive Churchill medal winner Nathan Cleary was relentlessly brilliant with his kicking game, suffocating South Sydney with precision and smarts. The Panthers were not going to beat themselves and they were not going to give South Sydney opportunities.\nIn a year that appeared to represent a seismic shift in what rugby league looked like thanks to some ill-considered rule changes and a mid-season evangelical blitz on high tackles that saw both points and dismissals in the form of the send off and the sin bin reach modern record heights, nothing did in fact change in the end.\nThe rule changes were duly wound back during the finals \u2013 as everyone expected they would be \u2013 with the six-again rule that was feverishly enforced early in the season mostly ignored. Player welfare concerns about any contact with the head were seemingly no longer important once the finals could be sniffed.\nIf there is one certainty in rugby league though it is that, at its core, the game returns to its true self on the biggest stages. The posturing ends. Referees swallow their whistles. Hard lines become soft. Defence reigns supreme. The gladiatorial nature of the game comes to the fore.\nIt has long been accepted that more often than not, grand final success is built on defence. The Panthers were the top defensive side all season, conceding 12 points or fewer in 19 of their 28 games. They conceded just 24 points in their last three finals games.\nThe change in officiating no doubt suited Penrith and it is a credit to coach Ivan Cleary that the Panthers managed to use the new rules to their advantage better than any other team. While late-tackle set restarts were almost non-existent in the finals, referees were more than happy to blow them on the first tackle and Penrith were more than happy to concede them. It is a loophole that the Panthers took full advantage of, at almost no cost, allowing them to start a defensive stand with a set defensive line. The referees were helpless. They could no longer blow a penalty. It was tremendous coaching that proved critical in the grand final.\nFor Cleary Snr, the premiership victory was, of course, a dream fulfilled, the culmination of a life of sweat and stress and work and hope. He will also have taken much satisfaction after his return to the club three seasons ago came amidst much controversy. Those associated with the Wests Tigers will never forgive him for his departure. And his return to the Panthers seemed to come with a caveat that the architect of this Penrith run \u2013 and the man who sacked Cleary in the first place \u2013 Phil Gould would have to leave. Such circumstances come at a personal cost so when they result in success, it does make them all worthwhile.\nGould, despite his messy departure from Penrith, is another who will take great satisfaction from the win. He not only laid the foundations for this Penrith premiership but demonstrated that clubs can build premierships from the inside. The premiership will be somewhat bittersweet for Gould, but he can be incredibly proud that the Panthers won a title on his design that very much returned the team to the Penrith way.\nThere was something refreshing about this premiership. The Panthers won with their own. They did it playing a brand of rugby league that prized perfection. They were well coached. They executed. They played team-first. No premiership is ever forgotten but some are elevated, holding a more special place in the hearts of both fans and the game. This is one of those premierships.",

        "content": "Brexit, global supply chain issues and the \u2018long tail of Covid-19\u2019 creates \u2018perfect storm for UK firms\u2019\nStaff shortages are rippling out from the haulage, farming and hospitality sectors to almost all parts of the economy, putting \u201csevere pressure\u201d on medium-sized business across the UK, a new survey has warned.\nMore than a quarter of the 500 firms polled said the lack of staff was putting pressure on their ability to operate at normal levels, with reduced stock \u2013 due to the resulting supply chain disruption \u2013 hurting their business.\nWhile some firms had considered cutting production, others were planning to raise prices, leading to concerns over rising inflation as the Christmas trading period approaches.\nNearly a fifth said they were increasing wages to attract new staff, while others were introducing extra perks to lure workers.\nBut the report, released by accountancy and advisory firm BDO, said the knock-on effects for consumers could be \u201csignificant\u201d, with nearly one-third of businesses saying the prices would need to rise in the next three to six months to make up for the disruption.\nMore than one-third of firms in the survey said they had also cut down on the kinds of products and services on offer, with a further third planned to do the same over the coming month unless the situation radically improves. A similar proportion expect stock ranges to be affected long-term.\nBusinesses blamed the pandemic and Brexit for the shortage of overseas workers, with 38% saying a lack of regional talent was hurting their ability to recruit much-needed staff. \u201cBrexit, global supply chain issues and the long tail of Covid-19 has created a perfect storm for UK businesses,\u201d BDO partner Ed Dwan said.\n\u201cAfter navigating the challenges of the pandemic and hoping for some respite, businesses have found themselves facing more major disruption, with those across almost all sectors reporting staff shortages.\n\u201cThis is an era of upheaval, and the challenges faced by the UK\u2019s mid-tier \u2013 the engine of the UK\u2019s economy \u2013 points to a long road ahead,\u201d Dwan said.\nThe survey lays bare the challenges facing all tiers of British business. HGV driver shortages have already resulted in fuel shortages across the country, while large companies such as Tesco warned last week that the labour crunch could lead to empty supermarket shelves and panic buying in the lead-up to Christmas, unless the government relaxed immigration rules.\nPrime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government has since introduced emergency visas that will allow a potential 300 fuel drivers to arrive immediately and stay until the end of March, and let a potential 4,700 further food haulage drivers arrive from late October and leave by the end of February.\nElsewhere, the hospitality sector is also suffering from a lack of workers, with one in six jobs currently vacant, according to the latest business confidence survey from consultancy CGA and technology services firm Fourth.\nOnly 18% of the 200 businesses in the restaurant, pub and bar industries, said they were confident that they would be able to recruit and retain the staff needed to run their businesses. That is a dramatic drop from the 67% who felt secure about their talent prospects just three months ago.\nAround two-thirds said they expect to be hiring staff at a higher rate than usual this year, and were already struggling with absences, reporting that on average about 6% of staff were currently in isolation due to ongoing Covid risks.\nThe shortage is forcing businesses to step up efforts to attract and keep hold of staff, with three-quarters saying they have offered better pay, while two-thirds have \u201ctried to cultivate the right working culture\u201d to retain workers. Bosses who have increased pay said they had hiked wages by 11% on average for current staff, and 13% for new hires.\nThe report said that higher wages would pile extra costs on the hospitality sector, which was already facing rising food, drink, supply and utility costs.\nOne of CGA\u2019s directors, Karl Chessell, said the figures illustrated the \u201cfull scale\u201d of the hospitality sector\u2019s recruitment and retention crisis, and called for government support.\n\u201cThousands of businesses are now critically short of staff, while many of those who have sufficient labour face a fight to keep hold of it,\u201d Chessell said. \u201cGaps at front and back of house and fast-rising wage costs threaten to derail the industry\u2019s recovery, and sustained, targeted government support is now urgently needed to tackle the problem.\u201d",

        "content": "Chaudhry Moonis Elahi backed out after learning Pakistan authorities had to be informed, leak suggests\nA minister in Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan government pulled out of making planned investments through offshore tax havens after he was told his country\u2019s tax authorities would be informed, documents in the Pandora papers suggest.\nChaudhry Moonis Elahi, Khan\u2019s minister for water resources and a member of an influential family in Pakistani business and politics, expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d in August 2017 about the investment being reported to his home country, according to the papers, and instead decided to establish a trust structure in the UK.\nThe leaked documents, reviewed by the Guardian and International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), do not specify why Elahi became concerned. But they show he had presented as his source of funds for the investments a $33.7m (\u00a325m) sale of a family-owned company in Lahore that had been the subject of historical corruption allegations.\nThe revelations are likely to raise serious concerns in Pakistan, where in 2016 Khan, as an opposition challenger, expressed outrage after offshore interests linked to the country\u2019s political elite were exposed by the Panama papers.\n\u201cIt is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health, education, justice and employment,\u201d Khan said then. \u201cThis money is put into offshore accounts, or even western countries, western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer, and rich countries get richer.\u201d\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world\u2019s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong.

In June this year, Khan appointed him as a minister.\nA spokesperson for the Elahi family rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, and said the family\u2019s assets were all declared as required by law.\nAccording to the Pandora documents, in January 2016, Elahi met officials from the offshore wealth management company Asiaciti Trust to discuss buying a 24% stake in RYK Mills, a large sugar and renewable energy company headquartered in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province. Elahi told the officials he wanted to set up a trust and fund that would buy the 24% stake and also hold two properties in Britain.\nTo evidence his source of funds, Elahi showed Asiaciti a contract from his family\u2019s May 2007 sale of their own sugar company, CSK Limited \u2013 previously called Phalia Sugar Mills \u2013 for which they were paid 2bn Pakistani rupees, equivalent to $33.7m in 2007.\nThat sale, to another Lahore-based company, Colony Mills, was later subject to intense scrutiny in Pakistan, including allegations made by the Bank of Punjab (BoP) that its own loan to finance the deal had been corrupt.\nDue to Elahi\u2019s status as a prominent politician \u2013 a \u201cpolitically exposed person\u201d (PEP), according to compliance rules \u2013 Asiaciti commissioned a thorough due diligence report on him by the risk management arm of the global information company Thomson Reuters.\nTheir report, dated 21 January 2016, based largely on media coverage in Pakistan in both Urdu and English, noted there had been serious allegations surrounding the $33.7m deal, including that the Bank of Punjab itself had filed complaints against the Elahi family to Pakistan\u2019s National Accountability Bureau.\nThe key complaint at the time was that the bank had made a corrupt loan that enabled the Elahi family to sell the Phalia sugar mill. Moonis\u2019s father, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, still a prominent politician holding the position of speaker in the Punjab assembly, was at the time chief minister of the Punjab authority that owned the bank.\nThe Asiaciti due diligence report noted: \u201cThe BoP through its complaint alleged that [Moonis] Elahi, and the others [including his father], sanctioned an illegal BoP loan to the company of a director of the bank, in a bid to allow him to purchase Phalia Sugar Mills owned by Elahi\u2019s family.\u201d\nPakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency was also reported to have instigated an investigation into the loans.\nThe Thomson Reuters report to Asiaciti stated that there were risks of corruption, money laundering and fraud relating to Moonis Elahi, but noted he and his family had always denied the allegations. The investigations had not concluded with any findings of wrongdoing against them, according to the report.\nAsiaciti agreed to take Moonis Elahi on as a client, and did register a trust structure located in low-tax Singapore and the Pacific tax haven of Samoa, the papers show, in preparation for the investment in RYK Mills and to hold the two properties in the UK.\nAsiaciti officials then advised Elahi that if they were to go ahead with the investments, they would need to share his financial information with the relevant tax authorities in Pakistan under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), a global information-sharing system set up to combat tax evasion.\nAt that point, Elahi appears to have become concerned and decided not to go ahead.\nAsiaciti noted of a telephone call with Elahi: \u201cMoonis has concerns about the CRS reporting requirements of the structures to Pakistan \u2026 Moonis advised that he obtained advice from his legal advisers and as a consequence established a structure in the UK, whereby [sic] his wife and children are residents.\u201d\nIt is not clear what Elahi\u2019s concerns were about CRS reporting to Pakistan or what the legal advice was that led to him establishing a structure in the UK.\nA prestigious London property linked to him does appear to have subsequently been transferred, legally, into a trust. The property, an apartment at Riverlight Quay, near the South Bank, had been bought for \u00a35.45m in September 2015 by a company named LO89 Ltd \u2013 the same company that paid Asiaciti its \u00a37,000 in fees for the Elahi work. Two years later, LO89 transferred the property, for no payment, to a UK company owned by a family member of Elahi\u2019s.\nIn November 2018, the family member\u2019s company transferred the apartment, again for no payment, to another British resident, who appears to hold it on trust.\nThe British resident did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the property, and whether she does hold it on trust for the Elahi family. Citing confidentiality, the solicitor who worked on the property transfer also declined to answer questions, including whether he had been involved in forming a trust for the Elahi family, and if he carried out due diligence on the family and the source of their funds, particularly due to their probable status as PEPs.\nA spokesperson for the Elahi family rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, saying: \u201cIn the past due to political victimisation, misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons against the family in the name of so-called accountability.\u201d The family\u2019s assets were all declared as required by law, the spokesperson added.\nThe Bank of Punjab said it could not answer questions about the allegations or its response at the time due to laws requiring customer confidentiality. Colony did not respond to questions from the Guardian and ICIJ.",

        "content": "As the Tzeltal people resist huge infrastructure projects across Chiapas state, the new national guard barracks springing up are alarming many\nMicaela* always stops to kiss a cross at the base of three hills, a lush swath of land in the indigenous ejido of San Sebasti\u00e1n Bachaj\u00f3n, Chiapas. Her ejido, meaning communal land, is shared among more than 5,000 Tzeltal inhabitants. But soon, they will also have to share it with Mexico\u2019s national guard.\nThe national guard has built 165 barracks in Mexico since it was created only two years ago by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to replace the federal police, which he said was corrupt. Micaela\u2019s community is leading the first lawsuit against one of 500 or so barracks planned across the country.\n\u201cIn August 2020 we heard rumours that a plot of land was sold, and that the municipal president donated the land to the national guard,\u201d Micaela says. \u201cThey worked night and day to finish the barracks. It went up very quickly.\u201d\nAccording to the land\u2019s shareholders, neither the local government nor the national guard consulted the community.\nMexico is legally bound to the International Labour Organization\u2019s convention 169, which recognises the right of indigenous peoples to prior consultation regarding any activity affecting their lives or lands.\nWith no federal mechanism to regulate this process, indigenous consultations are designed by state authorities, an ambiguous exercise that often undervalues indigenous land rights. In San Sebasti\u00e1n Bachaj\u00f3n, community leaders say a consultation was held only for a select group of shareholders.\n\u201cThe community never agreed to the barracks,\u201d says Micaela. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the national guard here because this is our territory.\u201d\nConstitutionally recognised as a civilian force under civilian leadership when it was created in 2019, the guard has been criticised since then for its similarity to the country\u2019s armed forces. A recent proposal by L\u00f3pez Obrador to make the guard a permanent part of the army has only fuelled these concerns. The widespread construction of barracks is part of an important debate about whether the deployment of the national guard confirms what critics see as the de facto militarisation of Mexico.\nIvette Galv\u00e1n, a lawyer with the Miguel Agust\u00edn Pro Ju\u00e1rez Human Rights Center (Centro Prodh), says: \u201cThis is the first [injunction] presented by an indigenous community against these barracks on the infringement of their collective rights.\u201d The injunction to suspend construction of the barracks, represented by Centro Prodh, was presented last December in the capital of Chiapas state, Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez.\nAccording to lawyers acting for the community, the judiciary rejected the move to halt construction, arguing that the barracks were ordered by the defence ministry (Sedena). \u201cThe legal basis for its denial effectively argues that the barracks respond to the needs of national security,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n, \u201caffirming the scale of the guard\u2019s coordination with the military.\u201d\nIn 2021, the national guard deployed about 100,000 troops, of whom 60,000 were previously under the defence ministry. Responsible for public security, the guard also oversees immigration and combating organised crime but also reforesting the country, a far-reaching deployment seen by some as confusing.\nCata Hern\u00e1ndez, representative in Chiapas for the National Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Women (Conami), says they are still unsure about what the implications will be of the national guard\u2019s presence in their community, but adds: \u201cWhat we know is that in the past, the deployment of the military has had a negative impact, particularly for women and girls.\u201d\nAfter resisting the presence of military forces for decades, Chiapas is littered with the remains of former police and military bases. After the Zapatista uprising in 1994, the San Andr\u00e9s Accords demanded self-determination, access to justice and autonomy for Chiapas\u2019s indigenous groups, requests that remain unfulfilled. The rape of three Tzeltal women at a military checkpoint in 1994 has gone unpunished.\n\u201cWhen they [soldiers] were here years ago, they impregnated women, abandoned children, entered our meeting space without permission, and cut down our trees. We are fearful,\u201d Micaela says.\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n Bachaj\u00f3n was moved to take legal action against the barracks in October 2020 when, during a peaceful protest, three civilians were arbitrarily detained and at least 13 were wounded by state and municipal police.\nVict\u00f3rico Galv\u00e9z, of the Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas Human Rights Center, said the national guard\u2019s failure to intervene was negligent. Galv\u00e9z said the police charging two indigenous protesters with rioting was \u201ca way of telling the communities not to act, threatening that the same will happen to them\u201d.\nJuan Jim\u00e9nez Garc\u00eda, a community spokesman, says there is no need for the national guard to be in his community. \u201cThe landowners go to their cornfields, their coffee fields, why do they want to keep watch on us?\u201d he asks.\nFor the Tzeltal inhabitants of Chiapas, the barracks also raise concerns about their sovereignty in the face of development. At stake in the region are at least 40 infrastructure projects, including the Mayan Train, a controversial plan for a 1,000-mile (1,600km) railway connecting Palenque in Chiapas with other tourist sites in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, and a 400-mile highway connecting Pijijiapan with Palenque. The community in San Sebasti\u00e1n Bachaj\u00f3n is opposed to the highway project.\n\u201cOne of the greatest threats of militarisation is the repression of social movements and protest, especially for a region with a long history of organisation,\u201d says Gustavo Castro, founder of the local organisation Otros Mundos Chiapas. The human rights defender also pointed to the experiences of activists in Nicaragua and Honduras, where the security forces, as well as criminal gangs and paramilitaries, have violently silenced environmentalists to protect foreign investment.\n\u201cWe already know, with any small problem the government sends thousands of guards, and we can\u2019t do anything because there are more soldiers than shareholders,\u201d says Micaela. \u201cWhatever happens, we won\u2019t be able to defend our land.\u201d\nMexico\u2019s lower chamber of congress recently approved a new federal bill on consulting indigenous and African-Mexican peoples. The bill, however, withholds the right to consultation on matters of national security. \u201cBringing these concepts closer to the Tzeltal worldview is a pending obligation,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n.\n* Her name has been changed to protect her identity",

        "content": "From climate change to welfare, here\u2019s what we know about the MP set to replace Gladys Berejiklian as NSW premier\nThe New South Wales treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, has emerged as the man most likely to take over as the state\u2019s premier following Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s bombshell resignation last week.\nThe treasurer has been working hard on building a profile in recent months \u2013 perhaps in the hope of the premier\u2019s job becoming vacant \u2013 but despite serving in the NSW government ministry since 2014, for many voters, Perrottet is a largely unknown quantity.\nSo who is the would-be premier of Australia\u2019s largest state?\nA member of the NSW Liberal party\u2019s right wing, Perrottet first made a name for himself as a University of Sydney student through his vocal support of the Howard-era voluntary student unionism reforms. He was heavily involved in student politics and was a president of the NSW Young Liberals.\nIn the lead-up to the 2011 election, which saw the Coalition win government in NSW for the first time in 16 years, Perrottet won preselection with the support of the ultra-conservative Liberal party powerbroker David Clarke. That early mentorship helped cement his reputation as a conservative warrior.\nMany of his colleagues say that view of Perrottet lacks nuance, and that his handling of the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic is evidence the would-be premier is not an ideologue.\nBut he has been vocal in prosecuting the conservative cause on a number of social and political issues, describing the ABC as \u201ca mouthpiece for left of centre views\u201d, and criticising some climate change policies as a \u201cgratuitous waste\u201d of money.\nPerrottet has been a key member of the NSW government\u2019s so-called crisis cabinet, which has overseen the state\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBut while he has signed off on all of the decisions \u2013 including the almost four-month lockdown Sydney has been placed under during its second-wave Covid outbreak \u2013 the treasurer has consistently been reported to have been in favour of fewer restrictions.\nIn July, he reportedly opposed an extension of the lockdown, as well as suggesting to the state\u2019s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, that she take a pay cut if Sydney was unnecessarily locked down in response to the pandemic (he told the AFR he had no recollection of this comment when asked).\nDuring his career Perrottet has sent mixed signals on climate change. During a speech to the conservative Centre for Ideas in 2015, Perrottet lashed what he described as the \u201cgratuitous waste\u201d in the former federal Labor government\u2019s spending on climate change abatement policies, mocking the \u201calmost religious devotion of the political left to climate change\u201d.\nThose comments \u2013 along with a social media post from 2016 in which he wrote that \u201cif you question manmade climate change, you are not a sceptic\u201d \u2013 have been circulated widely by his political opponents in the days since Berejiklian\u2019s resignation.\nWhen that video surfaced two years ago, Perrottet did not shy away from the comments, but also stressed that he had always \u201cbelieved in the science of climate change\u201d. He has also been part of a government which has promised to cut the state\u2019s emissions in half this decade.\nIn the same 2015 speech, Perrottet placed partial blame for rising divorce and declining fertility on the welfare system.\n\u201cWhile the decline in birth rates is multi\u00adcausal, there is no doubt the meddling hand of big government is once again at work,\u201d he told the Centre for Independent Studies.\n\u201cCountries with large pension systems tend to struggle with fertility.\n\u201cIn essence, the welfare state was acting as a substitute for the family, crowding \u00adout its formation, and increasing rates of divorce.\u201d\nThe speech, made when he was finance minister, cited US politician Daniel Moynihan\u2019s view that \u201cmarriage was penalised and single parenthood subsidised\u201d by the welfare system, pointing to the western Sydney suburb of Mount Druitt as an example of what he called a \u201ctangle of pathologies\u201d.\n\u201cDelinquency, dysfunction, crime and family breakdown. And with the same devastating effects,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe well-intended, but ham-fisted intervention into social policy by governments is having very real economic consequences.\u201d\nBut during the pandemic, Perrottet has also pushed economic support for individuals and businesses. In July, after Sydney had entered a second lockdown due to an outbreak of Covid-19, Perrottet publicly called for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to reintroduce jobkeeper payments.\n\u201cPeople are in danger of slipping through the cracks, particularly those on income support that don\u2019t qualify for the current disaster payments,\u201d he said at the time.\nHe was key in pushing for the introduction of the jobsaver program, which includes employment subsidies for lockdown-affected businesses, as well as rent relief incentives, payroll tax reductions, deferrals and small business grants.\nMuch has been made of Perrottet\u2019s religion. Raised a Catholic, he attended the Roman Catholic school Redfield College in Dural, which has some links to the conservative Opus Dei order.\nPerrottet is not a member of Opus Dei, but has been open about his faith: \u201cI think having a Christian faith is part of who I am and inspires me to make a difference wherever I go,\u201d he said last year.\nIn 2019 Perrottet was the most senior member of the NSW government to oppose the decriminalisation of abortion in the state.\nIn the lead-up to the vote, Perrottet told the Daily Telegraph he could not support a law that, he said, would stop \u201cthe beating heart of an unborn child\u201d.\n\u201cWhile late-term abortions may be rare, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make them right,\u201d he said in the interview.\nDuring the debate in parliament \u2013 before the bill eventually passed \u2013 he said supporters of abortion decriminalisation were \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d.\nHowever, in the debate he also acknowledged \u201cnot everyone is lucky enough to be in my circumstances\u201d.\n\u201cEvery day there are women out there who fall pregnant in difficult and sometimes impossible conditions of poverty, abuse, neglect and violence,\u201d he said in the speech.\n\u201cI can understand why many of them in that situation would want to consider ending their pregnancies. But our first response as a community should be to help, not to harm, and to comfort, value and support both mother and child.\u201d\nMuch has been made of a 2016 Facebook post following the election of US president Donald Trump, in which Perrottet welcomed his win as \u201ca victory for people who have been taken for granted by the elites\u201d.\n\u201cIf you support stronger borders, you are not a racist,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cIf you want a plebiscite on same-sex marriage, you are not a homophobe.\u201d\nBut in a speech later that year in which he called for a \u201cconservative spring\u201d, Perrottet also articulated what he said was the failure of the mainstream political parties to stop the rise of Trump and other populists. In the case of the US Republicans, he said the party\u2019s embrace of an \u201celite big business agenda\u201d had \u201cshut out their base\u201d and did not respond to the \u201cgrowing disillusionment around them\u201d.\n\u201cHere, we are in real danger of forgetting the forgotten people ourselves and we cannot make that mistake. There is and always will be a centre-right vote in this country.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the Liberal party will always be its natural home. This is not something I want to see happen. But just like the Republicans, we are vulnerable to disruption if we do not reflect the concerns of our base and represent its ideas.\u201d\nWhen John Howard endorsed Perrottet over the weekend, the former prime minister said part of his support for the treasurer was based on his \u201ccommitment to economic reform\u201d.\nAs NSW treasurer, Perrottet has pushed a number of economic reforms including changes to stamp duty taxes on home purchases which would introduce an opt-in property tax, as well as pushing a national debate about the need for GST reform.\nBut his time as treasurer has not been without controversy. A series of investigations into the $60bn workers\u2019 compensation system icare found it had underpaid up to 52,000 injured workers by up to $80m in compensation.\nPerrottet has said the insurer was working to address underpayments, which he said were less extensive than the investigation suggested, and icare has previously said the \u201crecently publicised issues of past practice don\u2019t reflect the way icare aspires to deliver services and work is under way to address this on multiple fronts\u201d.",

The first two will warm you up for the third, which is probably the most stunning example of a dissection puzzle I have ever seen. Prepare to be awed \u2013 and have your brain twisted inside out.\n1. Librarian\u2019s Nightmare Part I\nDivide the shape below, which looks like an open book, into two identical pieces. (In other words, if the shape was made of paper, how do you cut it so that you get two identical pieces with no extra material left over. Pieces may be flipped over.)\nNow divide the shape into three identical pieces.\n2. Librarian\u2019s Nightmare Part II\nDivide the following shape (the book and the hands) into two identical pieces. Again, the pieces may be flipped over.\nThese first two were variations on puzzles you may have seen before. The next one takes the genre to the next level. It\u2019s an extremely ingenious take on castling in chess. Marvel at its humour and elegance \u2013 and best of luck!\n3. Castling\nCut the first shape below into two pieces, in such a way that they can be rearranged to make the second shape. The pieces can be flipped.\nIsn\u2019t it brilliant? So clever.\nIf you would like to print out a copy of these puzzles, on which to draw the cuts, this link is to a pdf. The pdf also contains some hints on how to solve them.\nI\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. PLEASE NO SPOILERS\nUPDATE: The solution can be read here.\nHan Dongkyu is a student at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering. His website is queuedlab.com\nIn other South Korea news, on Saturday October 9 the country celebrates Hangul Day, an annual holiday that celebrates Hangul (\ud55c\uae00), the writing system used for the Korean language, which was devised in the fifteenth century by a team of scholars and is widely praised by linguists as the most perfect and scientific script in common use in the world. I\u2019m not aware* of another country that celebrates its writing system with a public holiday, so three cheers for South Korea and Hangul! Forgive me the blatant plug, but if you are interested in finding out why the script is so amazing, and tackling a puzzle in which you must decipher some common Korean words, you will find one in The Language Lover\u2019s Puzzle Book, my most recent book, which is out in paperback this week.\n*UPDATE: A reader has just informed me about the Day of the Bulgarian (Cyrillic) alphabet, which is a public holiday in Bulgaria. It\u2019s full name is (according to Wikipedia) the Day of the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius, of the Bulgarian alphabet, education and culture and of Slavic literature. PS, there\u2019s a puzzle about Tajik, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet, in my book too!\nI set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

        "content": "Exclusive: Supporters of Berejiklian are confident the Icac investigation will clear her of any wrongdoing and say she would be a \u2018great asset\u2019\nThe outgoing New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has been approached by senior Liberals in the state to run for the federal seat of Warringah.\nSome federal MPs say Berejiklian is seriously considering the proposal to switch to federal politics, but believe she wants to wait until the investigation being undertaken by the independent commission against corruption is complete.\nSupporters of Berejiklian are confident that the Icac investigation will clear her of any wrongdoing, while Berejiklian has insisted she has always acted with \u201cintegrity\u201d.\nIt is understood that the prime minister, Scott Morrison, is aware of the approach to Berejiklian about Warringah, which would give the Coalition a strong chance of taking back the blue-ribbon seat, currently held by independent Zali Steggall.\nBerejiklian\u2019s state electorate of Willoughby is adjacent to Warringah, in the federal electorate of North Sydney.\nPrior to Steggall\u2019s 2019 election win, the northern beaches seat was held by former prime minister Tony Abbott for 26 years, and had not had a Liberal primary vote below 50% since 1983.\nIt is now held by Steggall on a 7.2% margin.\nThe former NSW premier, Mike Baird, had previously been touted as a potential candidate for the Liberals, but he ruled this out in April this year.\nLiberal MP, John Alexander, said that Gladys Berejiklian would \u201cbe a great asset\u201d for the party federally if she chose to run.\n\u201cI\u2019m more thinking as a punter \u2013 what an asset she would be for the Liberal party,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bringing in a very confident woman, totally on her ability, it would help to address a lack of women in the party. It would be a great thing to entice her \u2013 but she might need some time to mend.\u201d\nOther party sources said they doubted the Icac matter would be resolved in time for Berejiklian to run for the seat, pointing out that nominations opened last week. Manly barrister Jane Buncle and a former adviser to Morrison, Sasha Grebe, have indicated they will nominate in what is expected to be a hotly contested preselection.\nBerejiklian declined to comment on the potential move on Monday.\nThe push to install Berejiklian into a key seat for the Coalition comes as the outgoing state transport minister, Andrew Constance, also indicates his intention to run for federal parliament in the south coast seat of Gilmore.\nConstance faces some resistance from within the party, however, with south coast lawyer Paul Ell securing strong support of moderates in the branch to run.\nOn Sunday, Constance announced he would resign from the ministry and as MP for Bega, and revealed he would run in Gilmore with the backing of Scott Morrison.\nConstance said he would be putting his case to members.\n\u201cI look forward to talking to the local branch members, they are the ones who decide this. I will be putting my best foot forward, not only on my record and what I have achieved in the last 18 and a half years as the state member, but more importantly what I can achieve in the future,\u201d Constance told Guardian Australia.\nNominations for the seat open on November 1, and close on November 19.\nBut while the process is in train for preselection to take place, some senior party sources say an intervention will be needed to ensure Constance is preselected if Ell is not persuaded to stand aside.\nThey believe Constance is key to winning Gilmore from Labor, with the seat integral to the Coalition\u2019s strategy of gaining seats in NSW to offset expected losses elsewhere.\nA \u201cfactional round table\u201d has already been set up in NSW to negotiate the outcome in a range of seats, including in the held seats of Reid, Mitchell and North Sydney where challenges to sitting MPs had emerged.\nThe round table includes factional representatives from state and federal parliament, the state director, Chris Stone, state president, Philip Ruddock, and Morrison\u2019s principal private secretary, Yaron Finkelstein.\nIt is likely that these seats will not go to a ballot of branch members, with the party expected to blame lockdowns and the limited time before the election for the decision, and emphasising the need for \u201cstability and certainty\u201d around sitting members.\nThe party is also scouting for a conservative candidate to run in the seat of Hughes against former Liberal Craig Kelly, who shifted to the crossbench earlier this year, and will run under Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia banner.\nThe Labor MP for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, accused the Liberals of \u201ctalking about themselves\u201d following Constance\u2019s announcement.\nPhillips, who entered parliament in 2019 after local Liberal party members split over Morrison\u2019s decision to parachute Warren Mundine in as the candidate, told Guardian Australia on Monday she had \u201cseen it all before in Gilmore\u201d.\n\u201cJust because someone nominates doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be preselected as the candidate \u2013 that\u2019s up to the Liberal party,\u201d Phillips said, nodding to possible opposition to Constance.\n\u201cI think Coalition are more concerned with talking about themselves and you\u2019ve seen that again yesterday,\u201d she said, in reference to his resignation.\nConstance\u2019s state seat of Bega, which stretches from Batemans Bay in the north to Bega, Merimbula and Eden in the south, had a high public profile during the black summer bushfires.\nPhillips\u2019 seat of Gilmore stretches from Kiama and the Shoalhaven in the north and overlaps the Bega electorate only in the Eurobodalla shire in the south, at Batemans Bay, Mogo, Moruya and Tuross Head.\nOn Sunday, Constance said in a statement he wanted to continue representing his local community on issues \u201csuch as the new hospital developments, and ensuring the community is listened to on vital projects such as the Milton-Ulladulla and Moruya bypasses\u201d.\n\u201cI love our region, its people and I could not be more proud to continue to serve. From black summer to the pandemic, we are the strongest and most resilient communities that you will ever see.\u201d\nMorrison said that Constance \u201chas an outstanding local reputation and a great deal to offer at the federal level, especially given his experience in the NSW government \u2026 He tells it straight and would make a great member of our team.\u201d\nIn 2020, Constance announced he intended to quit state politics after the bushfire recovery was complete. This is the second attempt in as many years by Constance to break into federal politics and follows his aborted attempt to run for Eden-Monaro.\nThe Coalition is keen to recapture both Gilmore, held by Phillips with a 2.6% margin, and Eden Monaro, held by Labor\u2019s Kristy McBain by 0.4%.",

When he succeeded Shinzo Abe \u2013 who had stepped down because of health issues \u2013 last September, his approval rating was about 70% but quickly plummeted over his response to the coronavirus pandemic and his insistence on hosting the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, despite widespread public opposition. Suga said last month he would not seek re-election as LDP president.\nKishida\u2019s first task will be to keep Covid-19 cases low, enabling him to guide the world\u2019s third-biggest economy out of the pandemic and allow a virus-weary population to resume something approaching normal life while preventing a fresh outbreak and renewed pressure on hospitals this winter.\nThe quietly spoken 64-year-old, a centrist with a reputation as a consensus builder, is to announce the dissolution of parliament on 14 October, with the lower house election to take place on 31 October, the public broadcaster NHK and other media reported.\n\u201cI think it will be a new start in its true sense,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI want to face this time ahead with strong feelings and strong determination.\u201d\nKishida, Japan\u2019s 100th prime minister, retained Suga\u2019s foreign and defence ministers, while incoming ministers included several allies of Abe, who is close to Kishida despite backing his far-right rival, Sanae Takaichi, in the first round of the two-leg LDP leadership race.\nThe cabinet of 20 ministers includes just three women \u2013 a statistic that underlines Japan\u2019s poor performance on gender equality, particularly in the political sphere, where female lawmakers account for a tiny proportion of MPs in the lower house.\nThirteen posts went to MPs with no previous ministerial experience, in line with Kishida\u2019s pledge to bring in new blood. His LDP leadership rival, Seiko Noda, was put in charge of addressing gender inequality and the low birthrate, but there was no place for Takaichi. \n\u201cThe Kishida cabinet aims at balance with consideration given to major factions, young lawmakers, and neighbouring countries,\u201d wrote Junichi Makino, SMBC Nikko securities chief economist, in a note. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of cabinet formation that reflects Kishida, who works not to make enemies.\u201d\nDuring his party leadership campaign, Kishida had promised a \u201cnew capitalism\u201d that would address the income gap, which had grown under eight years of Abe and his successor Suga.\nBut analysts said Kishida, aware of Abe\u2019s ability to mobilise votes in his favour in the second round of voting in the party contest, had drifted to the right during the campaign, suggesting that little would change on economic and foreign policy.",

        "content": "Chief minister says federal funding deal still possible despite PM\u2019s \u2018shakedown\u2019 comment and NSW would have most to gain\nThe ACT chief minister has called on Dominic Perrottet, who is likely to become the next NSW premier, to lead a state push for an injection of federal funds to hospitals under strain due to Covid-19.\nAndrew Barr said on Monday he still believes the door is open for an agreement, despite prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s description of the push as a \u201cshakedown\u201d.\nBarr said on Monday those comments were not \u201cparticularly helpful\u201d. He also revealed that at last week\u2019s national cabinet meeting the federal health secretary, Brendan Murphy, had conceded hospital beds were taken up by elderly and disabled patients usually cared for by the commonwealth.\nThe federal government has so-far agreed to split Covid-related health costs but has not agreed to lift restrictions on growth in other hospital costs.\nLast Thursday all state and territory health ministers wrote to their federal counterpart, Greg Hunt, demanding the Morrison government provide an immediate funding boost to help them manage the \u201cunrelenting strain\u201d on health and hospital systems because of the pandemic.\nThe states are concerned that regular funding for all treatments has not kept up with increased costs \u201cdue to additional infection control procedures, PCR testing, maintenance of bed capacity during fluctuating demand, and capacity to respond to surges in Covid-19 cases\u201d.\nThey also called for certainty of funding, asking that the existing 50-50 cost sharing of Covid health costs between the commonwealth and the states and territories be extended \u201cuntil at least the end of 30 June 2023\u201d.\nOn Friday, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, linked the issue to reopening her state\u2019s border \u2013 earning a rebuke from Morrison that the pandemic should not be used \u201cas an excuse for shake-down politics\u201d.\nBut Barr said it was \u201csimply about what we will need to do across all levels of government for our health system to manage what is, I hope, a once in a lifetime experience.\u201d\nHe also noted the issue of \u201cbed-blocking\u201d, in which patients remain in hospital when they should be in aged care or a National Disability Insurance Scheme placement \u2013 both \u201careas where the commonwealth has regulatory responsibility\u201d.\nBarr said both levels of government had worked \u201crelatively well\u201d on mental health packages, which states and territories want to continue on a 50-50 cost-sharing split for 12 months.\nIn relation tosharing Covid expenses, Barr said it was a \u201csound principle\u201d that should continue.\nBarr also called for a cap limiting growth in hospital costs to 6.5% to be lifted temporarily. \u201cClearly a pandemic is going to lead to an increase in activity across the hospital system of more than 6.5%,\u201d he said.\nBarr noted Morrison\u2019s comments, but said they did not appear to rule out a 50-50 funding split for regular funding.\n\u201cIn terms of emissaries to the prime minister \u2013 I think that the NSW premier-elect is to be Mr Perrottet, [he] will certainly need to lead the engagement with the commonwealth on this specific issue, as NSW is the biggest state. NSW would clearly have the most to gain from a successful negotiation.\u201d\nThe Victorian deputy premier, James Merlino, told reporters in Melbourne although he had not heard Morrison\u2019s \u201cshakedown\u201d comment he \u201cwould have thought that for all Victorians and Australians, 50-50 funding sounds about right\u201d.\n\u201c[It] sounds fair \u2026 given that both federal and state and territory governments have responsibility for our health system and hospitals, that would be something that should happen.\u201d\nHunt said the commonwealth \u201calready provides 50-50 funding for additional Covid expenditure in hospitals\u201d, totalling $6.3bn so far. \u201cThat continues to be the case and is ongoing,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne.\nLabor has signalled its willingness to attack the Morrison government over the issue, with frontbencher Ed Husic describing Liberal governments as \u201cnot good for our health\u201d.\nThe Liberal MP Fiona Martin noted the funding increases and told Guardian Australia that \u201cthere is no barrier to any state or territory matching or exceeding the commonwealth investment in their own hospital systems\u201d.\n\u201cIn saying that, I think the government should always be open to considering emergency funding in times of crisis as has been demonstrated with recent initiatives during Covid-19,\u201d she said.\nOn Monday Hunt also announced Australia had purchased an extra 15,000 doses of sotrovimab, an intravenous antibody treatment shown to reduce hospitalisation or death by 79% in adults with mild to moderate Covid-19.\nExperts estimate that eight to 15% of adults with Covid-19 will be recommended for treatment with sotrovimab, although it must be given within five days of developing symptoms.\nAustralia is also in advanced negotiations with pharmacy companies for an antiviral pill, which Hunt described as a \u201cmuch easier means of\u201d delivering antibody treatments than intravenously.",

It also owes money to homebuyers who were sold high-interest investment products at the same time sold as agreeing to purchase property.\nCai said China\u2019s banks could absorb the losses. \u201cIf you look at the banks they\u2019re some of the most profitable in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in terms of looking at how the restructuring process looks like in China, I think it\u2019s likely the retail investors, especially people who have bought homes, they are the one who likely to have the highest preference.\n\u201cIn terms of overseas [bond holders], they definitely will probably get a haircut.\u201d\nUS Securities and Exchange Commission documents show that recent holders of Evergrande bonds have included funds run by Van Eck, KraneShares and JPMorgan. However, in recent weeks firms that specialise in owning distressed debt have been snapping up the bonds for as little as 30\u00a2 in the dollar.\nAnalysts speculate that the return to bondholders under a Chinese government-run winding up process could be as little as 25\u00a2 in the dollar.\nEvergrande\u2019s looming collapse, and wider jitters in the country\u2019s real estate market, caused ratings agency Fitch to downgrade its forecast for the Chinese economy last month. There have also been concerns the collapse might cause a fall in the iron ore price if it slows construction, which is about 25% of the economy.\nCai said that impact would be felt most in third and fourth-tier cities. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at major cities in Shanghai, Beijing. Shenzhen, all these large cities, there is still actually a chronic shortage of housing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think you might say see collapse or decline in some regional parts, but this is not likely to cause a national wide collapse in the housing market.\u201d\nAs markets throughout Asia felt the backwash of Evergrande\u2019s latest woes on Monday, Kazutaka Kubo, a senior economist at Okasan Securities, said: \u201cThe biggest problem is not a default by Evergrande but the environment that has led to its downfall. Authorities are regulating housing loans and lending to property firms. Markets are looking for a next Evergrande already.\n\u201cThere is rising risk Evergrande\u2019s woes will spread to the entire Chinese property sector.\u201d",

        "content": "A Boston legend returned to New England on Sunday but was outplayed by the man drafted to be his long-term replacement\nEven on a weekend when the Red Sox clinched a ticket to face the hated New York Yankees in the MLB playoffs, there was only one storyline that really mattered in Boston on Sunday: Tom Brady returning to the New England Patriots with his new team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe game began as a lovefest. The crowd cheered an introductory video starring the man who led them to six Super Bowls over 20 years, and broke out into \u201cBRA-DY\u201d chants when he ran on to the field. There were boos too, but they were all but drowned out by the cheers.\nYet, by the fourth quarter a new subplot had emerged: the rise of Brady\u2019s heir as Patriots quarterback, Mac Jones. While the pregame discussion pitted Brady against his old head coach, Bill Belichick, Jones nearly hijacked the narrative. Some achievement in a game in which Brady also became the NFL\u2019s all-time passing leader.\nThe Bucs won 19-17 but Jones legitimately outplayed Brady. He went 31-for-40 with two touchdowns while picking up 275 passing yards, edging out Brady\u2019s 269. Brady didn\u2019t throw a single touchdown, going 22-for-43 in a game in which the Patriots defense kept limiting Tampa Bay to field goals. But there was more to Jones\u2019s performance than just statistics. His quick release, accuracy and cool head were reminiscent of Brady at his best.\nJones, of course, is still a long, long way from emulating Brady and, as is normal for a rookie, has looked out of his depth at times this season. On Sunday, he took four sacks while the Patriots\u2019 most impressive throw of the night might have come from wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. But Jones was good enough to be a missed field goal away from leading New England to an upset victory over the reigning Super Bowl champions as Nick Folk\u2019s 56-yard effort doinked off the upright in the final minute.\nAs for his opposite number, a man as ruthlessly devoted to winning as Brady cares about the result more than the method. We\u2019ll leave the armchair psychiatrists to determine the sincerity of his postgame hug with Belichick (the two met later privately), but Brady looked happy to have gone to his former home and boosted the Bucs\u2019 record to 3-1.\nBrady & Belichick. #TheReturn pic.twitter.com/1434KKsb66\nAs for the Patriots, an encouraging, well-fought loss is still a loss and they are now 1-3 and look to be well outside of the playoff picture. But the fans got to celebrate their glorious past while seeing signs of a potentially bright future. Maybe there is life after Brady after all.\n\u201cBOOM, we want that ball. Fuck \u2018em!\u201d \u2013 New York Giants safety Jabrill Peppers, colorfully expressing his pleasure that his team won their coin toss against the New Orleans Saints.\nJabrill Peppers is excited about guessing the coin toss \ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/weQpxjtFqk\nThere may be a fine coming Peppers\u2019s way, but he was right to be excited about winning the overtime coin toss, a stroke of luck that gives one team a huge statistical advantage. It did in this case, as the Giants promptly took advantage of possessing the ball firstand their opponents didn\u2019t even get a chance to see the field. The game ended on a six-yard Saquon Barkley touchdown run that gave the Giants a 27-21 win over the Saints.\nFive. That\u2019s the number of rushing touchdowns scored by Carolina Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold this season, something which improbably gives him the league lead. In fact, he\u2019s the first NFL quarterback to rush for at least five touchdowns in the first four games of the season in the Super Bowl era.\nIt\u2019s unlikely Darnold will lead the league by the end of the season but it\u2019s an encouraging sign that the oft-mocked quarterback is putting things together in his new environment. You know what they say: you can take the quarterback out of the New York Jets \u2026 and you really probably should. Unfortunately for Darnold, his efforts were in vain on Sunday as the Panthers lost to a Dak Prescott-inspired Dallas Cowboys.\nPatrick Mahomes, quarterback, Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs came into Week 4 in an unfamiliar position: up against the wall and with something to prove. Mahomes made sure the Chiefs climbed their way to .500 by throwing five touchdowns during a 42-30 win over the Eagles.\nIt was a solid win but one that didn\u2019t feel secure until Mahomes\u2019s fifth TD pass late in the fourth quarter. The Chiefs are well overdue an easy win, one of those blowout victories that prove a team is clicking on every level. Unfortunately for them, their next opponent will be the Buffalo Bills, who humiliated the Houston Texans 40-0.\nThis could only happen to the Lions pic.twitter.com/QbmKWOXtf5\nThe Detroit Lions wasted no time to provide us with Sunday\u2019s most amusing moment. In what was yet another dreadful day for Detroit football \u2013 they remain winless after defeat to the Chicago Bears \u2013 fans had to watch a snap bounce off, well, an unfortunate piece of Jared Goff\u2019s anatomy for an easy Bears fumble recovery.\n-- The 37-year-old Aaron Rodgers looked like he had more left in the tank than the 39-year-old Ben Roethlisberger during the Packers\u2019 win over the Steelers. That\u2019s unsurprising \u2013 Rodgers is coming off of an MVP campaign while Roethlisberger looked washed for much of last year. Even though we hand them wins and losses in the box score, quarterbacks don\u2019t entirely determine team records. In the case of these two teams, however, it\u2019s clearly a key reason why the Packers are now 3-1 while the Steelers are 1-3.\nBen Roethlisberger is now the only QB in the last 20 seasons to lose yardage on multiple 4th-down completions in the same season, per ESPN Stats and Info.\n-- Let\u2019s turn our attention from a battle between two veteran quarterbacks to the rise of a rookie one. A Jimmy Garoppolo calf injury meant that, ready or not, it was time for rookie Trey Lance to see what he can give the San Francisco 49ers. While it wasn\u2019t the official NFL debut for the 2021 No 3 draft pick, it was his first extended chance with the keys to the team.\nThe results? Well, Lance went 9-for-18, threw two touchdowns without a pick, and collected 157 yards in what was an unplanned relief appearance. Not a bad start, but still not enough to secure a win against the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks won 28-21 to raise their record back to .500.\n-- How tricky is it to go undefeated in the NFL regular season? Well, just four games into the season, two of the remaining unbeaten teams had to face each other. In this case, the Arizona Cardinals (now 4-0) easily took care of the Los Angeles Rams (now 3-1) by a score of 37-20. The only other unbeaten team, the Las Vegas Raiders, will play the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday Night Football.\n-- There are no other unbeaten teams left because the formerly 3-0 Denver Broncos fell to the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens, still dealing with a ridiculous number of injuries, promoted former star running back and recent NFL nomad Le\u2019Veon Bell from the practice squad before the game. Bell made a few appearances in the Ravens\u2019 23-7 win but wasn\u2019t much of a factor, picking up a mere 11 yards on four carries.\n-- We mocked the New York Jets earlier this column, so let\u2019s make up for that here. It looked like the Jets were doing that thing they always do when they let the Tennessee Titans score a game-tying touchdown in the final minutes of their afternoon contest. Previous incarnations of the Jets might have crumbled right here but instead, New York regrouped, won the coin toss and scored first.\nA blown game in so many, many ways. Jets 27, #Titans 24 as Randy Bullock missed from 49 at the overtime horn. pic.twitter.com/2tJJyPH76i\nUnlike the Giants, the Jets could only manage a field goal, making the score 27-24. When the Titans made it to field-goal range on the other side of the field, the 0-3 Jets would have accepted coming out of this sloppy mess of a game with a tie. Then something unforeseen happened: it was Tennessee\u2019s time to stumble. Titans kicker Randy Bullock missed the 49-yard field goal wide left, cementing a ridiculous first win for the 2021-22 Jets \u2013 not that anybody should ever expect normalcy at the Meadowlands.",

Here though, we see everything through the lens of a queer Black film-maker who imbues every frame with startling frankness and radical empathy.\nPier Kids follows homeless gay and transgender youth of colour who have found their own community in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea Piers, highlighting the daily struggles of Crystal LaBeija, Casper and Desean. What emerges is a deeply intimate portrait of an organic collective under attack from all sides: brutal policing, urban gentrification and financial precariousness. Stories involving shocking discrimination and violence are filmed with a conspiratorial understanding, as if the camera is lending a friendly ear.\nStill, this is not aiming to be heartwarming in the maudlin sense. Impromptu voguing sessions on the sidewalk are interrupted by the sound of police sirens in the background. Crystal\u2019s salon visits are undercut by her aunt and mother deadnaming her. In fact, New York\u2019s pop culture image as a queer haven is under threat, with danger and joy going hand in hand. However, as the last breath of the summer sun wraps around these kids, many of whom have left abusive homes for the streets of New York, the warmth of the pier family feels more transformative than ever.\n Pier Kids is released on 8 October in cinemas.",

But be assured we are doing everything that is in our control to try and mitigate some of these challenges.\u201d\nSunak\u2019s comments came as the first military tanker drivers took to the roads to try to ease the petrol shortages. About 200 army personnel, half of them drivers, are being used mainly in London and the southeast of England, where the worst of the shortages remain.\nThe chancellor argued that higher pay need not necessarily lead to a spiral of rising inflation: \u201cIn an ideal world, if higher pay is being driven largely by higher productivity, then that is a net positive for the economy.\n\u201cIt will depend on the particular sector, and we will see what happens. We don\u2019t live in a command and control economy; the exact way that costs and prices manifest themselves is going to be different in each sector of the economy.\n\u201cBut we want a high-productivity economy, to lead to higher wages, and we\u2019re doing things to enable that.\u201d\nThis might take time, Sunak said, acknowledging that for now the UK was more of a shortage economy, with wages for people such as HGV drivers being increased purely to plug labour gaps.\n\u201cBut if that catalyses people to think about their supply chains and their business differently, to then invest in technology or equipment that can help drive up productivity, because now wage levels are higher \u2026 that can be a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen overnight; it\u2019s a process.\u201d\nSunak said he believed people would not end up being poorer in real terms, saying he was not convinced that inflation would reach 4% by the end of the year.\n\u201cIt could, but we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still the belief of the Bank of England and most other central banks that what we\u2019re seeing at the moment will be transitory and will pass through the system over the course of next year.\u201d\nAsked if people would simply demand more pay rises in response to rising prices, Sunak added: \u201cWe\u2019re getting into economic theory here, about people\u2019s inflation expectations.\nIn an earlier interview, Sunak dismissed the argument of the Tory MP Chris Loder, who told a conference fringe meeting that he hoped the HGV driver shortage would lead to supermarket supply chains being dismantled.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would say there\u2019s an upside to people struggling with supply chain challenges and not being able to get what they want at the time they want it. No one wants to see that.\u201d he told Sky News.",

Calculations based on publicly available mortality data suggest that the \u201cexcess death\u201d toll between the start of the pandemic and July this year is nearly 600,000.\nThe pandemic has reached Russia\u2019s leadership. Last month, Vladimir Putin was forced to go into self-isolation after \u201cseveral dozen people\u201d in the president\u2019s inner circle tested positive.\n\u201cThe recent developments are very concerning,\u201d said Vasiliy Vlasov, an epidemiologist at Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics. \u201cEven though many people have already been sick and the country should have developed some immunity, deaths are on the rise again. \u201cThis was expected as there have been practically no restrictions and a very sluggish vaccination rate,\u201d Vlasov added.\nRussia, which was the first country to create a coronavirus vaccine, has struggled to vaccinate its population. Only 29% of the adult population have received two shots of one of the three Russian vaccines being used. Vaccines made abroad are not being distributed.\nOfficials have said the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated, and Putin has repeatedly urged Russians to get the jab. However, independent polls show that many Russians are sceptical of the Russian-made vaccines. Critics have principally blamed the low uptake on a botched vaccine rollout and mixed messages the authorities have been sending about the outbreak.\nIn addition, coronavirus antibody tests are popular in Russia and some observers suggest this contributes to the low vaccination numbers. Western health experts say the antibody tests are unreliable either for diagnosing Covid or assessing immunity to it. The antibodies that these tests look for can only serve as evidence of a past infection. Scientists say it\u2019s still unclear what level of antibodies indicates that a person has protection from the virus and for how long.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very busy few weeks. Hospitalisations are rising quickly again,\u201d said a surgeon at Moscow\u2019s Clinical Hospital Number 50 who has been treating Covid-19 patients from the start of the pandemic and did not want to give his full name.\nThe deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, who manages the national Covid-19 response, said last week that a difficult period was ahead. \u201cWe have a rise in morbidity and I want to ask you to be careful,\u201d Golikova said.\nDespite the stark figures for deaths and infections, authorities have been reluctant to introduce nationwide restrictions that could hurt the economy. Restaurants, bars and nightclubs remain open, though some regions have announced they will reimpose rules requiring people to show vaccination certificates to get into some venues.\nMoscow briefly tried during the summer to require proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for indoor customers at restaurants and bars, but abandoned the programme after business owners complained of reduced revenues.\nThe Kremlin last week pressed regions to take steps to slow the spread of coronavirus but rejected reports that lockdowns were being considered.\nAssociated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian share 10m-kronor prize for discovery of receptors for temperature and touch\nTwo US researchers have won the 2021 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for work that unlocked the secrets of the sense of touch.\nProf David Julius, a physiologist at the University of California in San Francisco, and Prof Ardem Patapoutian, a neuroscientist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, were honoured for their discovery of receptors in the skin that sense heat, cold and touch \u2013 making them crucial for survival. The work paves the way for a range of new medical treatments for conditions such as chronic pain.\nThe award, announced on Monday by the Nobel assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, is worth 10m Swedish kronor (\u00a3845,000), to be shared equally between the winners.\nProf Abdel El Manira, a neuroscientist at the Karolinska Institute and member of the Nobel committee, said without the receptors we would not be able to sense our world, to feel the urge to pull our hand from a flame, or even stand upright. The discoveries, he said, had \u201cprofoundly changed our view of how we sense the world around us\u201d.\n\u201cDuring the last year we have been socially distancing from each other, we have missed the sense of touch, the sense of the warmth that we give to each other during a hug,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd during a hug, these are the receptors that give us a feeling of the warmth, the closeness to each other.\u201d\nThrough experiments that began in the 1990s, the scientists pieced together how nerve impulses are triggered in the skin so that temperature and pressure can be perceived.\nJulius turned to capsaicin, the compound that makes chilli peppers burn, to identify sensors in nerve endings that respond to heat. Meanwhile, Patapoutian studied pressure-sensitive cells and discovered further receptors that respond to being poked and prodded.\nPatapoutian missed the call from Stockholm because his phone was set on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d. He was eventually reached when the Nobel committee got through to his 92-year-old father in Los Angeles. \u201cI first heard from him, which was very special,\u201d Patapoutian said.\nThe first breakthrough came when Julius and his co-workers created a library of millions of strands of DNA that corresponded to genes in sensory nerve cells. Through a painstaking effort that involved adding these genes to cells that did not normally react to capsaicin, they identified one gene that made cells respond to the burning compound. The gene allowed cells to build a protein, TRPV1, which turned out to react to heat perceived as painful.\nWorking independently of one another, Julius and Patapoutian went on to use menthol to discover a receptor for sensing the cold, named TRPM8, and a host of others activated by a range of different temperatures.\nOn the back of their success, Patapoutian and his colleagues set out to understand how cells respond to touch. Through more laborious experiments into 72 genes they hit on one that allowed cells to respond \u2013 with a small electrical signal \u2013 when poked with a micropipette.\nThe gene carried the blueprints for a receptor the scientists named Piezo1, after the Greek word for pressure. Soon after they found a similar touch-sensitive receptor, Piezo2, which had a critical second role of sensing body position and movement, or proprioception.\nProf Patrick Haggard, at UCL\u2019s Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, said: \u201cJulius and Patapoutian have shown, in beautiful mechanistic detail, how the full range of different bodily sensations work. Their research brilliantly reveals how the different sensory qualities that we experience every day, such as temperature and touch, each correspond to a specific individual molecule or set of molecules embedded in the membranes of sensory neurons that are found throughout the body.\n\u201cTheir work on temperature sensations is particularly thought-provoking. Temperature is a single physical continuum, but we experience it through two different sensory systems, one for warmth and one for cold, and each depending on a distinctive molecule.\n\u201cThe idea that the sensation of cold comes down, ultimately, to the presence of the TRPM8 molecule is just fascinating: it\u2019s about the closest scientists have got to a truly mechanistic understanding of our own conscious experiences.\u201d\nThe 2021 Nobel prize in physics will be announced on Tuesday followed by the chemistry prize on Wednesday.",

        "content": "An elderly English couple take a 5,000-mile road trip across India and Bangladesh in their Rolls-Royce in this gentle travel documentary\nHere\u2019s a gentle, low-stakes travel documentary about a couple\u2019s 5,000-mile road trip across India and Bangladesh in a vintage car. Jan and Rupert Grey loaded up their 1930s Rolls-Royce and set off from Mumbai. In interviews, Jan has described them as \u201can elderly English couple driving an elderly English motor\u201d. But in all honesty, these two are a pair of ageless evergreen boomers, recreating a backpacking adventure on the hippy trail they did in the 60s.\nThere are some mildly hairy moments along the way: mechanical trouble inevitably; and a spot of bother with anti-government rebels. Rupert gets roped into acting in a Bollywood movie, a small part playing a detestable colonial-era governor. The nastiness doesn\u2019t come naturally to him but the aristocratic vowels do. Rupert, a prominent media lawyer, is the great-grandson of 19th-century prime minister Earl Grey.\nActually, what makes the couple so likable is that they are sensitive of their privilege. Rupert jokes that they are a pair of \u201cupper-class English people poncing about India\u201d. But they are courteous travellers who have got, as one friend puts it, \u201cglobal good manners\u201d. Saying that, the Greys\u2019 influence comes in handy when the Rolls gets stuck at the Bangladesh border; Rupert has a word with a government minister and poof, the problem disappears.\nAs a travelogue, the film perhaps has more to say about the couple than the places they visit \u2013 it\u2019s a love story as much as anything else. Jan wasn\u2019t keen on the trip, but didn\u2019t want to be apart for six months. Rupert is an extrovert, a risk-taker; though another friend suggests that Jan is probably the stronger of the two. This is a polite portrait, shot at arm\u2019s length \u2013 if they ever argued, we don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s a film of limited interest perhaps, but something for the Grey family to treasure.\n Romantic Road is released on 8 October in cinemas.",

        "content": "The club totem put recent goalkeeping errors behind him to frustrate Bayern and lay the foundations for a famous win\nAs his still quite incredulous teammates celebrated in a line in front of the away end at Allianz Arena, they found the clarity to recognise who deserved the moment. A reluctant Kevin Trapp was shoved towards the celebrating fans by a gaggle of his team but if his beaming grin showed how unexpected a delight this was, it also admitted that there were other reasons to savour Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s triumph \u2013 for the team, and for their goalkeeper individually.\nOn the other side of it Bayern Munich, having suffered a first defeat of the Julian Nagelsmann reign and having seen a run of 30 undefeated Bundesliga home games come to an end, were pinching themselves too. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the game was greatly different from those of the last few weeks,\u201d suggested Nagelsmann. \u201cThe defeat is particularly painful because it was avoidable.\u201d\nIn this game of opposites, Nagelsmann\u2019s visiting counterpart Oliver Glasner was visibly delighted on the back of a first Bundesliga win since he arrived from Wolfsburg, where he had guided his team to Champions League qualification. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to Munich for Sunday coffee and cake,\u201d he had insisted before the match, but few paid any real mind to that. Did the coach even really believe it? The last time Eintracht had gone to Bayern and avoided defeat? It was a month under 14 years ago, in November 2007, when a rearguard action straight from Friedhelm Funkel\u2019s playbook earned a goalless draw.\nThere were, conversely, a few not-so-surprise elements to how Eintracht got there. After Leon Goretzka\u2019s goal appeared to signal the opening of the floodgates, Eintracht hit back less than three minutes later as Martin Hinteregger headed in their only corner of the game \u2013 not the first time the Austrian centre-back has made hay in the Bayern penalty area. Then there was the winner, with Filip Kosti\u0107 scoring from the Filip Kosti\u0107 spot \u2013 wide left of the penalty area from the perspective of Eintracht attacking, almost too acute to get a shot off from until you recall the cleanness with which he drives a shot from there \u2013 even if the great Manuel Neuer might wince at the sight of the ball whizzing under his elbow on the TV replays.\n\ud83e\udd85 Martin Hinteregger and Filip Kostic got the goals to give @Eintracht_Eng a first-EVER win at the Allianz Arena, and end the home side's 30-match unbeaten home run in the #Bundesliga! \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/AQ6BXzkTwy\nIn between, one figure stood between Bayern having another afternoon like all the others. \u201cWe knew that we needed an outstanding goalkeeper today,\u201d said Glasner, \u201cand we had one.\u201d It was a particularly auspicious day for Trapp to shine. The former Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper is a totem for the club having returned in 2019, and is the club\u2019s highest-paid player.\nHe has also had a tough start to the season which could have been much worse \u2013 his inexplicable attempt to keep the ball in play at Borussia Dortmund on the opening day gifted Marco Reus an easy finish, only for VAR to spot the ball had gone out, and a fumble of Ondrej Duda\u2019s tame shot almost gave K\u00f6ln a potential winner in Frankfurt last week, with the cameras again saving the day as Anthony Modeste was pulled up for a tight offside after Florian Kainz finished the rebound. Errors are one thing, but the frequency and range of them, from handling mishaps to clumsy work with the ball at his feet, rung alarm bells.\nIn midweek Hansi Flick named his Germany squad, and Trapp wasn\u2019t in it. He arrived at Bayern \u201cin search of his lost form,\u201d as Frankfurter Allgemeine\u2019s J\u00f6rg Daniels put it. \u201cHe is not,\u201d wrote Daniels on Saturday, \u201can oasis of calm in a team that is in transition and longs for security and stability.\u201d The sense that Trapp should be a beacon during a period in which Eintracht are moving on having lost coach, sporting director (Fredi Bobic) and last season\u2019s top scorer (Andr\u00e9 Silva) had brought his difficulties starkly into the spotlight.\nIn front of Flick, who watched on from the stands, Trapp responded in the best possible way. He pulled off a string of saves when his team needed him most, from Leroy San\u00e9, Serge Gnabry, a Robert Lewandowski header from point-blank range and \u2013 crucially \u2013 tipped over a Goretzka piledriver when the midfielder threatened an equaliser in stoppage time. He could not have done more.\nThere was a little more to Eintracht\u2019s exploits than an inspired goalkeeper, of course. Glasner had indeed arrived with a plan, to exploit the spaces behind Bayern when they pushed up even more aggressively than they had under Flick at times, which has been a calling card of Nagelsmann\u2019s team in recent weeks (and is still to be perfected). Eintracht were brave when they had the opportunity and in Kosti\u0107, who also set up Hinteregger\u2019s goal with a 19th assist this calendar year, they had the quality to take their chance.\nKosti\u0107 almost joined Lazio this summer, and losing the winger and Silva in the same summer would have been too much. Eintracht must be grateful they held on to him. If Kosti\u0107 and Trapp are in form, Glasner has something to work with \u2013 and knowing how his predecessor Adi H\u00fctter recovered from a tough start, they have reason to be ambitious.\n Leverkusen are now level on points with Bayern after an easy 4-0 win at Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday, carried by a Patrik Schick brace but once again inspired by Florian Wirtz. Gerardo Seaone welcomed \u201ca change of air\u201d for his players as they stop for internationals \u2013 ahead of meeting Bayern in the first game after the resumption.\n Dortmund also went into their mini-hibernation with a win, edging Augsburg 2-1 in a game in which Marco Reus became the first player in the club\u2019s history to register 100 goals and 100 assists, setting up Julian Brandt\u2019s winner. The club will be relieved as Erling Haaland announced on Monday that he will not be able to join up with Norway \u2013 the Norwegian FA had been pushing to include the striker despite Sebastian Kehl\u2019s insistence that \u201che can\u2019t train, let alone play at the moment.\u201d Meanwhile Bild claimed on Sunday that Jude Bellingham sitting out England duty to recharge was instigated by the wishes of his parents.\n Leipzig\u2019s 3-0 home win over Bochum involves a lot of partially misleading statistics, taking Jesse Marsch\u2019s team to nine scored, none conceded in two very productive Bundesliga home games. The two were split by a huge midweek setback against Club Brugge, in which their slapdash defending left them with a Champions League mountain to climb. It also took them almost 70 minutes to break their struggling visitors, with substitutes Dominik Szoboszlai (\u201cI want to play all the games,\u201d he told Sky with some irritation) and Andr\u00e9 Silva combining to break the deadlock before Christopher Nkunku finished Bochum off.\nFriday: Cologne 3-1 F\u00fcrth. Sat: Dortmund 2-1 Augsburg, Hertha 1-2 Freiburg, Leipzig 3-0 Bochum, Stuttgart 3-1 Hoffenheim, Wolfsburg 1-3 Gladbach. Sun: Arminia 0-4 Leverkusen, Bayern 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Mainz 1-2 Union Berlin.\n M\u00f6nchengladbach built on last week\u2019s win over Dortmund with an impressive victory at Wolfsburg, in which the youthful hue of Adi H\u00fctter\u2019s team shone through. The 18-year-old American Joe Scally scored the clincher \u2013 which the coach called \u201csymbolic\u201d \u2013 to seal at 3-1 win late on.\n More trouble for Hertha, who lost at home to a late Nils Pedersen goal (as substitute, of course) for Freiburg. Only a huge injury list, which includes his son Marton, is saving Pal Dardai as it stands but he may not survive the international break.",

        "content": "Frances Haugen tells US news show why she decided to reveal inside story about social networking firm\nFrances Haugen\u2019s interview with the US news programme 60 Minutes contained a litany of damning statements about Facebook. Haugen, a former Facebook employee who had joined the company to help it combat misinformation, told the CBS show the tech firm prioritised profit over safety and was \u201ctearing our societies apart\u201d.\nHaugen will testify in Washington on Tuesday, as political pressure builds on Facebook. Here are some of the key excerpts from Haugen\u2019s interview.\nHaugen\u2019s most cutting words echoed what is becoming a regular refrain from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic: that Facebook puts profit above the wellbeing of its users and the public.\n\u201cThe thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money.\u201d\nShe also accused Facebook of endangering public safety by reversing changes to its algorithm once the 2020 presidential election was over, allowing misinformation to spread on the platform again. \u201cAnd as soon as the election was over, they turned them [the safety systems] back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before, to prioritise growth over safety. And that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me.\u201d\nIn a 15-year career as a tech professional, Haugen, 37, has worked for companies including Google and Pinterest but she said Facebook had the worst approach to restricting harmful content. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than anything I\u2019d seen before.\u201d Referring to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, she said: \u201cI have a lot of empathy for Mark. And Mark has never set out to make a hateful platform. But he has allowed choices to be made where the side-effects of those choices are that hateful, polarising content gets more distribution and more reach.\u201d\nThe document leak that had the greatest impact was a series of research slides that showed Facebook\u2019s Instagram app was damaging the mental health and wellbeing of some teenage users, with 32% of teenage girls feeling that it made dissatisfaction with their body worse.\nShe said: \u201cAnd what\u2019s super tragic is Facebook\u2019s own research says, as these young women begin to consume this eating disorder content, they get more and more depressed. And it actually makes them use the app more. And so, they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more. Facebook\u2019s own research says it is not just that Instagram is dangerous for teenagers, that it harms teenagers, it\u2019s that it is distinctly worse than other forms of social media.\u201d\nFacebook has described the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting on the slides as a \u201cmischaracterisation\u201d of its research.\nHaugen said \u201cperson after person\u201d had attempted to tackle Facebook\u2019s problems but had been ground down. \u201cImagine you know what\u2019s going on inside of Facebook and you know no one on the outside knows. I knew what my future looked like if I continued to stay inside of Facebook, which is person after person after person has tackled this inside of Facebook and ground themselves to the ground.\u201d\nHaving joined the company in 2019, Haugen said she decided to act this year and started copying tens of thousands of documents from Facebook\u2019s internal system, which she believed show that Facebook is not, despite public comments to the contrary, making significant progress in combating online hate and misinformation . \u201cAt some point in 2021, I realised, \u2018OK, I\u2019m gonna have to do this in a systemic way, and I have to get out enough that no one can question that this is real.\u2019\u201d\nHaugen said the company had contributed to ethnic violence, a reference to Burma. In 2018, following the massacre of Rohingya Muslims by the military, Facebook admitted that its platform had been used to \u201cfoment division and incite offline violence\u201d relating to the country. Speaking on 60 Minutes, Haugen said: \u201cWhen we live in an information environment that is full of angry, hateful, polarising content it erodes our civic trust, it erodes our faith in each other, it erodes our ability to want to care for each other. The version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world.\u201d\nThe 6 January riot, when crowds of rightwing protesters stormed the Capitol, came after Facebook disbanded the Civic Integrity team of which Haugen was a member. The team, which focused on issues linked to elections around the world, was dispersed to other Facebook units following the US presidential election. \u201cThey told us: \u2018We\u2019re dissolving Civic Integrity.\u2019 Like, they basically said: \u2018Oh good, we made it through the election. There wasn\u2019t riots. We can get rid of Civic Integrity now.\u2019 Fast-forward a couple months, we got the insurrection. And when they got rid of Civic Integrity, it was the moment where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t trust that they\u2019re willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.\u2019\u201d\nFacebook changed the algorithm on its news feed \u2013 Facebook\u2019s central feature, which supplies users with a customised feed of content such as friends\u2019 photos and news stories \u2013 to prioritise content that increased user engagement. Haugen said this made divisive content more prominent.\n\u201cOne of the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is it is optimising for content that gets engagement, or reaction. But its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarising \u2013 it\u2019s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions.\u201d She added: \u201cFacebook has realised that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they\u2019ll click on less ads, they\u2019ll make less money.\u201d\nHaugen said European political parties contacted Facebook to say that the news feed change was forcing them to take more extreme political positions in order to win users\u2019 attention. Describing polititicians\u2019 concerns, she said: \u201cYou are forcing us to take positions that we don\u2019t like, that we know are bad for society. We know if we don\u2019t take those positions, we won\u2019t win in the marketplace of social media.\u201d\nIn a statement to 60 Minutes, Facebook said: \u201cEvery day our teams have to balance protecting the right of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true. If any research had identified an exact solution to these complex challenges, the tech industry, governments, and society would have solved them a long time ago.\u201d",

They will look at our training, leadership, processes, systems and standards of behaviour, and examine cases where officers have let the public down.\n\u201cThis person will also work alongside me, challenging my senior team and our leadership on standards, corruption, sexual misconduct and how the Met responds when things go wrong.\u201d\nDick revealed details of how 650 additional officers will be dedicated to urban centres and particular neighbourhoods to combat violence against women and girls.\nThe force would also unveil an action plan for tackling violence against women and girls, increasing its effectiveness in targeting perpetrators, bringing more to justice and working with the wider criminal justice system to get better outcomes, she said.\n\u201cEvery single one of us in the Met realise that it will take time to rebuild your trust,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy pledge to you is that I will do all I can to improve women\u2019s safety and reduce the fear of violence.\n\u201cThe murder of Sarah Everard does not stand alone. I would like to say the murder of a woman in London is rare. Sadly, I cannot.\u201d\nThe Met last week said it would no longer allow plainclothes officers to make arrests alone and issued guidance to the public on how to challenge them over their legitimacy. But the guidance was criticised for its suggestion that if a person still did not feel safe, they should consider \u201cwaving a bus down\u201d.",

She added: \u201cHe was courageous and had committed his life to serving in the Royal Marines; he was selfless to such an extent that this was more important than his own career progression. He was exceptionally proud to have served as commandant general.\u201d\nInvestigations continue into the circumstances of Holmes\u2019s death, the Ministry of Defence said. But defence sources said it was understood he had taken his own life. There had been a period of personal difficulties, they said.\nHolmes\u2019s sudden death has rocked colleagues in the military. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said on Monday that \u201cwe mourn the tragic loss of one of our own\u201d \u2013 and praised Holmes for serving with \u201cdistinction and rigour\u201d.\nAdm Sir Tony Radakin, the head of the Royal Navy, said: \u201cMatt was also a dear friend to many, and a close friend of mine for over 20 years. He will be sorely missed by the service and especially the corps family.\u201d\nHolmes had been moved out from his position as head of the marines after a reorganisation, having served a little over a year and a half in what is normally considered a three-year posting. He had resisted the move, defence sources said, and this was reported earlier this year. But Radakin pressed on with the change, part of his wider transformation plan for the Royal Navy.\nHolmes was replaced by Lt Gen Rob Magowan and was allowed to stay on for six months, acting as an adviser, to help with the transition out of service.\nRadakin is one of the leading two candidates to replace Gen Sir Nick Carter as head of the armed forces, after Johnson completed interviews for the job last week. An appointment had been expected late last week, but that has been delayed until after the Conservative party conference.\nSome defence sources believe Radakin is Johnson\u2019s favoured candidate after the final round of interviews, although there is strong support from elsewhere in the military for Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of strategic command, responsible for both special forces and cyber operations.\nThe appointment is made by Downing Street from a field of five after a recommendation from Wallace.\nThe MoD said its \u201cthoughts, sympathies and deepest heartfelt condolences were with family and friends of Maj Gen Holmes\u201d.

        "content": "Analysis: chancellor reiterates what he believes in, including himself, during address at Tory conference\nAfter 18 months of opening the state\u2019s chequebook to pay for the huge economic cost of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Conservative party finally got a taste of the real Rishi Sunak in his speech to its annual conference.\nThe chancellor\u2019s address in Manchester was more about mood music than new policy announcements. Even the pledge to spend more helping young people find jobs after the end of furlough had already been trailed overnight.\nIt was, though, an encapsulation of what Sunak believes in: sound public finances, low taxation, a reliance on hard work rather than the state, the opportunities provided by Brexit, a belief in the transformative power of technology. And, of course, himself. Despite the show of loyalty to Boris Johnson, Sunak sees himself as a prime minister in waiting.\nUnlike the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, at last week\u2019s Labour party conference, Sunak was under no real pressure to come up with fresh initiatives. His speech was sandwiched between last month\u2019s mini budget announcing higher national insurance contributions to pay for the NHS and social care, and the real budget later this month when the real news on tax and spending is to be expected. The lack of meat may also have demonstrated a degree of political tact, since it left scope for the prime minister to make some headline grabbing announcements in his speech on Wednesday.\nThere were, however, a few clues in Sunak\u2019s speech about where he sees economics and politics heading in the coming week, months and years.\nFirst, there is going to be no climbdown from the government on the \u00a320 a week cut in universal credit that will come into force this week. While admitting life was tough for young, ambitious families, Sunak said: \u201cIs the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?\u201d\nThat, though, might not be the right question for the millions of the UK\u2019s working poor. An alternative would be: how will losing \u00a320 a week affect the ability to feed your family or heat your home?\nSecond, Sunak\u2019s cabinet colleagues are going to have to do a bit of belt-tightening in the spending review that will accompany the budget. The reason is that reducing the government\u2019s deficit is seen as necessary to deliver pre-election tax cuts.\n\u201cYes, I want tax cuts. But in order to do that our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing,\u201d the chancellor said.\nThird, the government clearly sees political mileage in being relentlessly upbeat. There was nothing in Sunak\u2019s speech about closed petrol stations or supermarkets with empty shelves, but much about his \u201cunshakeable belief\u201d that the future will be better. Johnson is trying to frame the argument as Tory optimism against Labour pessimism, and in that respect Sunak was fully on message.",

        "content": "Judge says court will look at possible submarine links as to how fishing boat sank off Cornish coast \nThe families of a fishing boat crew who believe their deaths 17 years ago were caused by a military submarine becoming entangled in their nets off the Cornish coast have told an inquest they hope they will finally learn the truth of what happened to their loved ones.\nA full inquest began in London on Monday into the deaths of two of the five men lost when the fishing trawler the Bugaled Breizh sank off the Lizard peninsula in January 2004.\nThe family of the skipper, Yves Gloaguen, 45, told the court he had been very safety-conscious, while relatives of the crew member Pascal Le Floch, 49, said getting to the truth was \u201cclose to our hearts\u201d.\nThe son of a third man who died, Georges Lemetayer, 60, said his father had expressed concerns about the number of accidents involving fishing boats and submarines, and added that he hoped the inquest would be a \u201cred light\u201d for military commanders and make them think more carefully about the safety of other vessels.\nThe Ministry of Defence has always denied that a Royal Navy vessel was to blame, but at the start of the inquest, Judge Nigel Lickley QC said he had decided it was right to look again if a submarine was involved.\nHe said the inquest, which is due to last three weeks, would look at the position and movement of submarines in the area at the time of the sinking, promising he would approach it with \u201can open mind\u201d and it would be a \u201cfair and rigorous\u201d investigation.\nThe inquest heard that the Bugaled Breizh, a 24-metre trawler, was fishing about 15 nautical miles south of Lizard Point when the skipper called for help, reporting that the boat was sinking. A large air and sea rescue operation was launched.\nThe bodies of Yves Gloaguen and Le Floch were recovered and taken to Cornwall, hence an inquest on their deaths in the UK.\nThe body of a third man, Patrick Gloaguen, 35, was recovered during a salvage operation to raise the boat and taken to France, and his death is not the subject of the inquest. The bodies of Lemetayer, 60, and a fifth man, Eric Guillamet, 42, were never found.\nThe inquest heard the incident was investigated at length by the marine authorities and courts in France.\nLickley said: \u201cThey examined the possibility the sinking had been caused by a submarine catching one or both of the long wires leading from the winches of the Bugaled Breizh to the trawl net. Some experts in the proceedings thought that was physically the most likely explanation while others disagreed.\u201d\nLickley said the French authorities came to the conclusion that the possibility of a submarine being involved could not be ruled out but there was no direct evidence to support this. The more likely explanation was that the trawl net dug into the seabed leading to the vessel heeling sharply and taking on water.\nThe judge said it emerged that there were three submarines in the area at the time, due to take part in a Nato exercise. Closest was the Dutch submarine Dolfijn, which was believed to be 12 miles away on the surface when the sinking took place. A German submarine, the U-22, was 40 nautical miles away, also on the surface. The British submarine, HMS Torbay, was said to be 100 nautical miles away beneath the surface. The US said they had no submarines in the area.\nFran\u00e7oise Jolivet, the widow of Yves Gloaguen, said he was a \u201cjoyful\u201d man who was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about safety. Speaking on behalf of the Le Floch family, Bertrand Le Floch said his brother had been called by the sea, adding: \u201cWe never imagined such a brutal or even violent death. The truth is close to our hearts.\u201d\nLemetayer\u2019s son, Thierry Lemetayer, said his father had once expressed concerns about \u201crecurring accidents\u201d between fishing boats and submarines.\n\u201cHe said it in fatalistic tone, not in revolt but in the hope that it would one day change. It probably didn\u2019t change fast enough.\u201d\nLemetayer said he hoped the inquest might spark a \u201cred light in the heads of submarine commanders so they take into account the presence of other boats\u201d.\nThe inquest is due to hear from witnesses including a Royal Navy rear admiral and current and former submariners.\nSpeaking before the inquest began, Frank Ryan, of law firm Vardags, which is representing the families of Gloaguen and Le Floch, said: \u201cThis David versus Goliath inquest should enable the victims\u2019 families to establish the real reason their loved ones\u2019 lives were so tragically lost.\u201d",

        "content": "Accomplished death bowler, who has a congenital back injury in the background, hopes to take fine Hundred form to the UAE\nEngland will spend the first week of their winter in quarantine, though for Tymal Mills the restrictions will feel trivial compared with those he faced a year ago. Mills spent three months of last winter in a back brace, recovering from a stress fracture and plotting a summer in which he would fight his way back to fitness and bowl so well that the England selectors who had ignored him for most of the past four years would have no option but to crowbar him into the squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in the UAE. On Monday night he will board the plane to Oman.\n\u201cI managed to muddle through last summer, but it was pretty sore in the end,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the winter I spent in a back brace, day and night, apart from when I was asleep or in the shower. That was tough. It was tough mentally more than anything \u2013 during lockdown I wasn\u2019t doing anything socially either, the weather was pretty bleak, and I\u2019m used to spending winters away playing in the Twenty20 leagues.\n\u201cI knew I had to get through it and then ramp up the training come the spring. I\u2019d kind of stopped thinking about England \u2013 I always believed I was good enough to get back in the mix, it\u2019s just been a case of being able to prove I was fit enough to be selectable. That was something I hadn\u2019t done until this year.\u201d\nTowards the end of 2020 Mills met Eoin Morgan, who reassured him that his name still cropped up in selection meetings. \u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding bowler we\u2019ve always been in communication with, wanting him to get fit, play as much cricket as possible and leave him alone until the World Cup comes,\u201d England\u2019s white-ball captain said earlier this year. \u201cThat was all I needed to hear, really,\u201d Mills says. \u201cThen it was just a case of doing what I had to do this summer and hoping for the best.\u201d\nFor a few months around his 29th birthday in August, Mills was at his peak: he was Sussex\u2019s leading wicket-taker as they reached the Twenty20 Blast semi-finals, and outstanding as Southern Brave won the inaugural men\u2019s Hundred. \u201cI\u2019ve been quite vocal in my support for the Hundred and what it could do for the shortest form of the game,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething the Blast can\u2019t give you is that exposure \u2013 so many great performances get missed because they can\u2019t be televised, whereas every match in the Hundred was televised. You could see who was bowling well, or if someone was only bowling well in certain situations, or if someone had one good game and five bad games.\n\u201cI saw it as a really good opportunity to play a full tournament \u2013 I\u2019m really happy that I played every game and I bowled my full allocation in every game that wasn\u2019t rained off \u2013 and I was really happy with how I bowled. It was a brilliant platform for the players.\u201d\nMills remains perhaps England\u2019s fastest bowler, despite being diagnosed with a congenital back injury in 2015 that has since limited him to playing the shortest forms of the game, and for a long time no more than four overs in a day. \u201cI don\u2019t have a number of deliveries where I know I\u2019m going to go \u2018pop\u2019,\u201d he says, but the possibility is always there.\nSince the diagnosis Mills has become a travelling gun for hire, crisscrossing the globe in search of Twenty20 action \u2013 it is telling that after Hove, the ground where he has bowled most deliveries in the format is Dubai International Stadium, where England will play two of their group games. But the World Cup represents the sternest test possible of a death bowler, as Ben Stokes famously demonstrated when England lost to West Indies in the final of the last event in 2016. Happily, that is one memory Mills is not scarred by.\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember if I watched it. I can\u2019t remember where I was or what I was doing to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cBowling at the death, they\u2019re the most high-pressure situations you can find yourself in as a cricketer. You\u2019re trying to win the game for your team, and it\u2019s all about how you deal with the occasion.\n\u201cOne thing I think I\u2019m pretty good at is I\u2019m not afraid to fail. That\u2019s a huge part of it. You have to be confident and want the ball. You need to want those overs. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, what I\u2019ve made my name doing over the last couple of years and if I\u2019m called upon to do it in the World Cup I\u2019ll step forward straight away. Pressure in my opinion is only as big as you allow it to be. You make it in your own mind.\u201d",

        "content": "Officer was investigated over indecent exposure claims six years before he raped and murdered Sarah Everard\nThe Wayne Couzens case has prompted questions over police disciplinary and misconduct procedures, including when and how officers are sanctioned or sacked.\nSix years before Couzens raped and murdered Sarah Everard, he was investigated for an indecent exposure allegation after being accused by a member of the public of driving naked from the waist down.\nAt the time, he was working as an officer with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the Kent-based armed police force in charge of protecting civil nuclear sites. Kent police investigated the claim but decided no further action should be taken. The CNC said it was not informed of any allegations against Couzens, who went on to join the Metropolitan police in 2018, where he again had armed responsibilities.\nThe handling of the Kent police investigation is subject to an inquiry by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\nAll forces have professional standards departments (PSDs), fictionalised in the BBC drama Line of Duty as \u201canti-corruption unit 12\u201d or \u201cAC-12\u201d. They record and investigate complaints from members of the public or the force.\nPolice officers must adhere to codes of conduct and any breach could lead to disciplinary action. PSD officers from the relevant force investigate most complaints and allegations of criminal offences against people serving with the police, although sometimes a chief constable might ask another force to investigate.\nLike all criminal investigations, the police will determine whether enough evidence is available to proceed the case to a charge or caution, or whether no further action should be taken. If the police want to proceed with a charge, they will refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision.\nCriminal offending by a serving police officer will be dealt with in the same way as with any member of the public: they will face a police caution or charge, and the latter will be dealt with by the courts, magistrate or crown.\nA conviction will probably \u2013 but not definitely \u2013 lead to dismissal after a misconduct hearing. However, the nature of the offending can be taken into account at the misconduct hearing.\nAll would-be police officers are subjected to vetting. Guidance published by the College of Policing says vetting should identify areas of vulnerability that could damage public confidence in a force or in the wider police service.\nIt states that allegations of criminal offences should be identified by the vetting procedure. However, an allegation would not unconditionally preclude an officer from joining the force.\n\u201cWhere the subject has previously come to adverse police attention \u2013 for example, been arrested, subject of a criminal allegation, or subject of investigation \u2013 but these matters have not resulted in a criminal conviction, a case-by-case assessment will be made,\u201d the guidance states.\nKey questions remain. Why did Kent police decide to take no further action against Couzens over the 2015 allegation of indecent exposure? Why was the force for which he worked, the CNC, not informed of the allegation? And why was the allegation not picked up by vetting procedures when he moved to the Met in 2018?",

One witness told the Aftonbladet newspaper that the driver \u201cseemed to lose control\u201d. The truck did not have time to swerve and the two vehicles collided at \u201cincredible speed\u201d, he told the newspaper.\nBoth vehicles caught fire and all three passengers in the car, which Sinteus said could have suffered a tyre blowout, died at the scene on Sweden\u2019s main E4 motorway. The truck driver was injured and taken to hospital where he was questioned by police.\nSweden\u2019s national police chief, Anders Thornberg, said the full outcome of the investigation could take \u201ca relatively long time\u201d, while the culture minister Amanda Lind called it \u201can extremely tragic traffic accident\u201d.\nThe publication of Vilks\u2019s drawings in a Swedish regional newspaper, to illustrate an editorial defending free speech, came a year after widespread Muslim outrage at the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten\u2019s publication of 12 cartoons of the prophet. Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favourable, and dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims.\nThe Swedish publication drew protests from Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan and Pakistan, as well as the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which called for \u201cpunitive actions\u201d against Vilks. The then prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, met ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries to try to defuse the situation.\nThe Islamist terrorist group al-Qaida subsequently placed a $100,000 bounty on the artist\u2019s head, prompting a failed 2009 assassination plot by Islamist sympathisers in the US and Ireland. In May 2010 Vilks was assaulted while giving a lecture on free speech at Uppsala University, and the same year his house was firebombed.\nFive years later, Vilks attended a free speech and blasphemy debate in Copenhagen organised in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris. The event was attacked by a man with a semi-automatic rifle who killed a 55-year-old Danish film director and a guard at the Copenhagen synagogue, before Danish police shot him dead.\nVilks, who had repeatedly said the cartoons were not intended to provoke Muslims but to challenge political correctness in the art world, was widely assumed to be the intended target.\nWhile the Muhammad drawing is what Vilks was best known for internationally, he was primarily a sculptor. His most significant work is widely considered to be a driftwood sculpture, Nimis, built illegally at a national park, which became the subject of a lengthy legal dispute with local authorities.\nWith Associated Press and Reuters",

The Italian arrives at Vicarage Road boasting a wealth of experience in charge of some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs, with Premier League, Coppa Italia and Copa del Rey titles among his managerial highlights.\u201d\nRanieri last worked in England during the 2018-19 season, when he took over at Fulham in November but won only three of his 17 games before being sacked after just 106 days in charge and replaced by Scott Parker.\nHis previous spell at Leicester was far more successful, famously leading them to the Premier League title in 2015-16 before being shown the door the following season with the club one point above the relegation zone.\nRanieri also managed Chelsea to second place in his first post in England between 2000 and 2004.\nMu\u00f1oz led Watford to second place in the Championship last season but that was not enough to save him beyond the second international break of this campaign, a statement at the weekend saying that \u201crecent performances strongly indicate a negative trend at a time when team cohesion should be visibly improving\u201d.\nThe goalkeeper Ben Foster admitted after the defeat at Leeds that the performance was \u201cconcerning\u201d. He said: \u201cIt was the whole game that went wrong, we weren\u2019t at the races, we knew what Leeds were about. We knew they\u2019d be pressing us all the time, high tempo and we spoke about it all week in training.\n\u201cWe got to the match and we didn\u2019t do a single thing we wanted to do which was concerning. I know the goal maybe should\u2019ve stood but that would\u2019ve been papering over the cracks because we didn\u2019t deserve to get anything from the game.\u201d\nThe last man to survive two years as Watford manager was Malky Mackay between June 2009 and June 2011. Since then Watford have had 15 permanent managers.",

        "content": "Defence ministry says it detected at least 56 flights hours after US urged Beijing to cease \u2018provocative\u2019 activity\nChina sent a record number of military aircraft into Taiwan\u2019s air defence zone on Monday, the fourth consecutive day of such air incursions by Beijing amid growing fears of further escalation.\nTaiwan\u2019s ministry of defence said it had detected at least 52 flights during daylight hours on Monday, including 36 fighter jets, 12 H-6 bombers, two transport aircraft and two surveillance aircraft. Late on Monday it reported another four fighter jets crossing into the zone after dark.\nIt followed consecutive missions of a then-record 38 planes on Friday, China\u2019s national day, 39 on Saturday, and 16 on Sunday. Monday\u2019s incursions into the air defence identification zone (ADIZ) \u2013 a buffer outside a country\u2019s airspace \u2013 came hours after the US state department urged Beijing to \u201ccease\u201d its activity, which it labelled \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cdestabilising\u201d.\nThe warplanes recorded during the day on Monday brought the total number for October to 149, surpassing September\u2019s 117, the previous highest monthly total recorded this year. The use of J-16 fighter jets also overtook reconnaissance planes as the most common aircraft in the People\u2019s Liberation Army sorties, said the Washington DC-based defence analyst Gerald C Brown.\nBrown said that while the timing of the weekend\u2019s activity with China\u2019s national day was not surprising, the size of the missions \u201ccaught people off guard\u201d.\nAll 56 planes flew routes out into the south-west corner of Taiwan\u2019s ADIZ and back, near the disputed Pratas Island in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said it had tasked combat air patrol aircraft, issued radio warnings and deployed air defence missile systems to monitor the activity.\nBeijing considers Taiwan to be a province of China it must retake, by force if necessary. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who has made \u201creuniting\u201d China and Taiwan a core legacy issue for his presidency, PLA activity has markedly increased, with near-daily sorties in the last two years.\nIn a regular press briefing on Monday, the spokesperson for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, Hua Chunying, condemned the US\u2019s comments on the incursions, saying China would \u201cresolutely crush all attempts at Taiwan independence\u201d.\nHua accused the US of violating the \u201cone-China principle\u201d, which is Beijing\u2019s official claim that Taiwan is a part of China. The US does not subscribe to the one-China principle, and its own one-China policy acknowledges only that Beijing makes the claim.\nThe PLA sorties\u2013 like military drills, disinformation campaigns and cyber-attacks \u2013 are a greyzone activity: combat-adjacent tactics that deliberately do not meet the threshold for an act of war, but which serve to intimidate and exhaust another party.\nThe potential circumstances and timing is debated, but there is general consensus that the likelihood of Beijing making a move on Taiwan is higher than it has been for decades, and world governments are increasingly speaking out against China\u2019s acts of aggression, or sending military assets to the region for \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises.\nAs cross-strait tensions worsen and activity increases, analysts fear the greatest danger for military conflict is through a greyzone tactic-related incident escalating.\nThe timing of larger-than-usual bouts of activity by the PLA is frequently attributed to significant events, or as a response to acts by Taiwan or allied nations to which Beijing takes exception. Taiwan celebrates the Republic of China\u2019s national day on Sunday, and there have been significant multilateral announcements in recent weeks, designed to counter China or support Taiwan.\n\u201cThe PLA doest exactly go and roll out the specific details on why they\u2019re doing things,\u201d said Brown. \u201cPeople focus a lot on the signalling side of things, and usually with the larger incursions there is a signalling component, but more often it\u2019s about intelligence gathering, wearing down Taiwan\u2019s air force, and pilot training.\u201d",

        "content": "Leak raises questions over the ultimate source of some of Lubov Chernukhin\u2019s donations\nThe star prize at last year\u2019s Conservative party fundraising ball was a game of tennis with Boris Johnson. The party\u2019s co-chair Ben Elliot was enlisted to play too. But when bidding started there was little drama. Well-heeled guests already knew who was going to outbid everyone: a tall, outgoing blond woman from Moscow who \u2013 as one person put it \u2013 \u201cdominates the room\u201d. \u201cShe always gets top prize. She wins every auction,\u201d the guest said, wryly.\nThe victorious bidder was Lubov Chernukhin, one of the biggest female donors in recent British political history. Since 2012, she has given the Tories \u00a32.1m. This extraordinary sum has paid for two tennis matches with the prime minister, including in 2014 when Johnson was mayor of London, as well as dinner with his predecessor Theresa May.\nChernukhin, a former banker married to the former Russian oligarch Vladimir Chernukhin, reportedly donates enough to the Tories to qualify for membership of a small group of ultra-rich donors who meet monthly with Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak. What this exclusive club discusses is not made public. \u201cShe\u2019s deep in the party,\u201d the Tory ball guest said.\nYet nothing really is publicly known of Chernukhin\u2019s views. That she is rich is self-evident. Her huge donations suggest a desire to nudge Downing Street and the country\u2019s politics in her preferred direction. She is simultaneously a public figure \u2013 named as a donor in electoral commission updates, the subject of BBC and Daily Mail reporting \u2013 and an enigma. The couple appear to prefer to keep it that way. As Vladimir Chernukhin acknowledged, giving evidence in a 2018 legal case against a fellow tycoon, it has been \u201cmodus operandi\u201d to disguise his commercial interests. He spoke of using \u201cfronts\u201d, \u201ccamouflage\u201d, and \u201csilent participation\u201d in specific commercial deals, adding: \u201cI want to be invisible.\u201d\nThe Pandora papers shed a revealing light on the Chernukhins. Leaked files reveal their extraordinary reliance on the hidden offshore world, and thereby offer a clue as to their interests. The couple go to remarkable lengths to keep their wealth and financial arrangements secret, the leak suggests, instructing lawyers over a tax authority dispute that spanned France, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands (BVI).\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world\u2019s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nThe papers also suggest Lubov Chernukhin\u2019s money flows, at least in part, from her husband\u2019s multifarious corporate structures. That raises the question over the extent to which it is Vladimir, not Lubov, who may be the ultimate source of some of the cash flowing into the Conservative party. Other documents raise questions about a source of Vladimir Chernukhin\u2019s wealth: a lucrative Moscow property deal he secretly struck when he was a senior public official in Russia.\nIn 2015, Johnson boldly stated that checks by the party had assured him Vladimir Chernukhin was not a Vladimir Putin \u201ccrony\u201d. All checks had been carried out, he said. The leak nonetheless suggests that Chernukhin may have in recent years remained on good terms with Kremlin-connected figures in Moscow: among them the wife of a government minister, with whom he owned a factory. At least until recently, Vladimir Chernukhin appears to have retained assets in Russia, some of them dating back to when he was a deputy finance minister under Putin and a powerful state banker.\nAs part of a joint investigation with BBC Panorama, the Guardian put a detailed list of issues and questions to the Chernukhins about disclosures in the Pandora papers and issues covered in this article. Their lawyers did not respond in detail to most of the questions, but stressed that their failure to address each allegation put to them should not be construed as an admission of their accuracy. They said the invitation to comment had raised \u201ca number of serious, false and defamatory allegations\u201d about their clients.\nThe Chernukhins\u2019 lawyers did not respond directly to the suggestion their clients appear to have taken elaborate steps to move their money around various offshore structures, in what may amount to lawful but morally questionable tax avoidance. Vladimir Chernukhin does not pay regular UK tax. Instead he is a \u201cnon-dom\u201d, the leak suggests, with Russian and British citizenships. Being non-domiciled in the UK can bestow certain tax advantages, such as not paying UK tax on foreign income. Lubov Chernukhin refuses to disclose her tax status. She acquired a British passport in 2011, which \u2013 as the Tory party is keen to point out \u2013 makes her donations legal.\nThe Chernukhins use a sprawling network of shell companies to maintain their opulent lifestyle, the Pandora papers suggest. Even by oligarchic standards, the details are remarkable. Several times a year the couple have \u201cchartered\u201d their own superyacht to sail around the south of France and the Caribbean. They have also rented their own private jet registered in the Isle of Man. In both cases money to pay the bills is provided from UK entities to offshore companies. Between 2011 and 2014 yacht hire alone cost them \u00a311m.\nIt is a similar story with the Chernukhins\u2019 \u00a330m London townhouse, overlooking Regent\u2019s Park. They spent nearly \u00a3100,000 installing CCTV cameras and a vault with a bombproof metal door. The security guard gets his wages from an offshore company. So do the butler and housekeeper. Even the firm that maintains the swimming pool using an underwater robot sends its invoices to a low-key family office in Singapore, from where they are forwarded to the BVI.\nThe pair own a \u00a310m country house in Oxfordshire, bought in 2006, two years after Vladimir relocated to the UK. Its quad bikes, beehives and chicken house are offshore-owned. In response to disruption during renovation works, an angry letter was sent to the contractor. It complained of blocked paths, and \u201cinappropriate language\u201d by workers. The author? An anonymous shell company, General Development Group Ltd, based in the BVI.\nWhile there is nothing to suggest illegality, the couple\u2019s reliance on offshore companies for even the most routine transactions is striking.\nIt is another Chernukhin property, however, that came to the attention of tax authorities, the leak reveals. In 2016, the French tax authorities sought information about Vladimir and Lubov\u2019s offshore wealth \u2013 something the couple fiercely resisted. It centred on a turreted villa, once the home of English aristocrats, on Cap d\u2019Antibes, a retreat popular with billionaires. Above the door is a Latin motto: small but convenient. The house belongs to a paper Portuguese entity. French tax officials wanted to know: who actually owns it?\nThe French wrote to the BVI\u2019s tax authority, the ITA. It in turn demanded information from the Panamanian law firm Alcogal, which managed the Chernukhins\u2019 island companies. Alcogal carried out its own research into the couple\u2019s offshore empire. It found 32 BVI companies linked to the Chernukhins, 28 of them owned by Vladimir.\nThe ITA\u2019s request for information caused alarm inside Alcogal, as it suggested to them potential concern over their clients\u2019 tax arrangements. Internal emails at the offshore provider show them pondering how best to respond. One possible solution was to \u201cstop providing\u201d the Chernukhins\u2019 companies with agent services, a supervisor suggested. It is not known what came of the French tax inquiries. However, documents in the Pandora papers do suggest the Chernukhins reacted aggressively when they discovered their offshore provider was in touch with French tax officials.\nTheir Swiss adviser demanded to know what information Alcogal had shared with international authorities. When Alcogal refused to say, the Chernukhins sued it \u2013 ultimately losing the case in early 2020. The east Caribbean supreme court ruled the Chernukhins were not entitled to see documents disclosed by Alcogal to tax authorities. Lawyers for Alcogal said the case demonstrated that it was a \u201cresponsible service provider which acts in accordance with applicable laws and cooperates fully with regulators\u201d.\nSeparately, the Chernukhins took legal action against the tax authority in Switzerland, demanding it reveal its communications with France\u2019s tax authority, which had requested information about who sat behind an opaque Swiss company. Multiple Swiss courts have dismissed that case. The Chernukhins\u2019 lawyers did not comment on the status of the French tax inquiries or their failed lawsuit against Alcogal. However, they said their clients \u201chave at all times been advised by reputable tax advisers and have complied with all applicable laws\u201d.\nOther files in the leak appear to shed light on the apparent source of at least some of Lubov Chernukhin\u2019s wealth. In Companies House filings she has in the past described herself as a banking consultant and \u201cinvestment director\u201d. She came to the UK around 2003. A few years later she met Vladimir Chernukhin, after he left his native Russia having apparently fallen out with Putin. By 2014, one of her husband\u2019s companies had loaned her UK company as much as \u00a39.4m, the documents suggest. They appear to show the loans were written off as \u201cbad debt\u201d, a process the couple seemingly used at other times after they lent cash between their firms.\nThere is no suggestion these intracompany loan structures were unlawful. However, they do appear to show substantial funds were transferred to Lubov Chernukhin from her husband\u2019s offshore empire. One key document in the files appears to confirm she is at least partly reliant on her husband\u2019s funds. It is an email exchange from 2017, after the BVI introduced new financial transparency legislation. Under the new rules service providers were obliged to pass the names of company beneficial owners to the authorities.\nThe provider described Vladimir as an \u201cinvestor in high-profile properties in the UK and abroad\u201d, adding that Lubov, who was referred to as a \u201chousewife\u201d, was \u201cfinancially supported by her husband\u201d. The Chernukhins\u2019 lawyers said it was not accepted that any of Lubov Chernukhin\u2019s political donations had been funded by improper means or affected by the influence of anyone else.\nLike other wealthy Russians, Vladimir Chernukhin started from nothing. \u201cAll of us came from the Soviet Union with zero money in the pocket,\u201d he said in 2018. The \u201call\u201d referred to future oligarchs who began as budding entrepreneurs back in the early 1990s, as the communist system fell apart. After a stint in the army Chernukhin went into finance. He founded his own company and joined the ministry of foreign trade.\nAt some point he must have attracted the attention of Putin, a KGB operative turned St Petersburg politician. In September 1999, a month after becoming Russia\u2019s prime minister, Putin made Chernukhin deputy chairman of Vnesheconombank (VEB). This was a plum role in a state bank. Chernukhin oversaw huge loans, to industry and to the regions.\nHis financial dealings in Russia came under scrutiny in 2018 when he testified in a high court legal battle brought against him by the oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The dispute centred on the ownership of a Moscow textiles factory, which the two men acquired in 2002 as a lucrative property development. Ultimately, Chernukhin won the case when a judge ruled in 2019 that he was Deripaska\u2019s true joint-venture partner in the project. Deripaska was ordered to pay $95m (\u00a370m) to resolve the dispute.\nSpeaking on oath during the trial, Chernukhin made rare and previously unreported comments about his time as a senior Russian state official. He said there were few rules preventing state or state-connected employees from doing private business of their own. But it was better to be discreet about it, he said. Rather than holding the investment in his own name, Chernukhin said he used a previous girlfriend as a proxy. \u201cShe was my front,\u201d he said of the woman, who was not Lubov.\nUnder cross-examination Chernukhin accepted that when he and Deripaska acquired the Moscow development, one of the things he could \u201cbring to the party\u201d was his relationship with Moscow\u2019s then mayor, Yuri Luzhkov.\nAccording to Chernukhin\u2019s testimony, when the project encountered planning difficulties, he and Luzhkov negotiated an agreement. As part of the arrangement \u2013 and in return for Luzhkov agreeing to smooth over the planning issues \u2013 Chernukhin suggested to the court he agreed to use his influence as chair of VEB bank, a cabinet-level position, to help an acquaintance of Luzhkov on another business matter. There is no suggestion Luzhkov\u2019s acquaintance was aware of the arrangements between the two men.\nChernukhin\u2019s testimony raises questions about whether he used his influence as a senior public official for his own private gain. After reviewing the oligarch\u2019s evidence about the deal with Luzhkov, at the request of the Guardian, Tim Owen QC said that while the \u201cyou scratch my back and I\u2019ll scratch yours\u201d agreement apparently described by Chernukhin in court was not proof of corruption, it \u201craises an obvious red flag\u201d for a political party accepting donations that could be derived from Chernukhin\u2019s wealth.\nIn their response to the Guardian, the Chernukhins\u2019 lawyers said Vladimir had not accumulated any of his wealth in a corrupt manner. They added that none of the high court proceedings, nor the findings made in the case, which Chernukhin won, supported any suggestion of corruption by their client.\nOther Pandora files suggest that in 2004, when he exited Russia, Vladimir Chernukhin was allowed to leave the country with the assets he had acquired during his government and VEB years \u2013 equating to about $500m (\u00a3366m). These were bundled into offshore firms. This very Russian story would have ended there were it not for the fact that Lubov Chernukhin, after she had become a British citizen, started donating large sums to David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives. Behind the scenes, and over non-public drinks and dinners, the couple were quietly building up a network of high-level British establishment contacts.\nThe files suggest the Chernukhins retain senior Russian connections. In 2017, Vladimir Chernukhin sold the St Petersburg factory plot he bought in the 1990s to a major Russian construction company. Purchase price: \u00a320m. His business partner in this deal was the wife of Yevgeny Yelin, a former deputy governor of St Petersburg who served as Putin\u2019s acting minister for economic development until 2017.\nIn July, the Financial Times suggested Lubov Chernukhin was a member of the Tory party\u2019s advisory board, the elite donor group that meets monthly with Johnson and Sunak. Conservative officials say it was set up before Johnson took power, but will not say when. Its existence was a closely guarded secret. Several of those who are reportedly part of this group have given \u00a3250,000 or more in 2020 and 2021, including Lubov Chernukhin.\nThe Conservative party said Lubov Chernukhin was a British citizen \u201cwhich gives her the democratic and legal right to donate to a political party\u201d, and added that donors did not influence government policy. One former donor disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s about access and political influence. When you sit next to an MP or minister or secretary of state you have one-on-one time. You can tell them your agenda. You can question them or make requests. They have to give their time.\u201d The donor was unimpressed with Lubov Chernukhin\u2019s gifts to the party. \u201cPeople suck up to her because of her money,\u201d they said.\nThis accusation may be unfair. But if nothing else, the leak suggests the Chernukhins are likely to be opposed to greater offshore transparency. The government is committed to introducing legislation that would reveal the true owners of offshore companies that buy property in the UK. If it is passed, the Chernukhins will be forced to declare their ownership of multiple homes \u2013 worth at least \u00a340m. So far, Johnson has not followed through on a 2018 draft law.",

In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nBut the Pandora papers \u2013 a leak of 11.9m files from 14 different offshore services providers around the world \u2013 reveal how the US is also emerging as a key location for trusts, which are typically used to shelter the personal wealth of super-rich individuals rather than multinationals.\nThe International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and the Washington Post said their analysis of the data had identified 28 trusts in the US tied to individuals or companies previously accused of misconduct overseas.\nThe disclosures will be a major embarrassment for the US president, Joe Biden, who upon entering office pledged to \u201clead efforts internationally to bring transparency to the global financial system\u201d.\nThe papers were leaked to the ICIJ, a US-based journalism nonprofit, which shared access to them with the Guardian, the BBC, the Washington Post and other media partners around the world.\nAccording to a 2020 state report, South Dakota\u2019s burgeoning trust industry holds an estimated $367bn (\u00a3273bn) in assets, a sum approaching the annual economic output of the Republic of Ireland \u2013 up from $75.5bn in 2011. The phenomenal growth has been supercharged by the state\u2019s aggressive drive to attract money by shielding trust owners\u2019 assets from foreign governments, taxes and even former spouses.\nSouth Dakota\u2019s moves have inspired other states to \u201cliberalise\u201d their trust regulations, a phenomenon that helped the US overtake Switzerland in the Tax Justice Network\u2019s 2020 global ranking of countries most complicit in helping individuals hide their finances from the rule of law.\nMore than 200 US trusts appear in the Pandora papers data, sheltering at least $1bn. While South Dakota emerges from the leak as the most popular location, with 81 trusts, Florida, Delaware, Texas and Nevada account for dozens more.\nThe trusts appear to be catering mostly to non-US citizens. Analysis by the ICIJ linked the trusts to individuals in 40 different countries outside of the US. Twenty-eight of the trusts appeared to be linked to individuals or companies accused of misconduct overseas, according to the ICIJ and the Washington Post.\nAmong those for whom South Dakotan trust firms have acted are a Colombian textile magnate who was previously fined $20m by US authorities investigating a major money-laundering network.\nJos\u00e9 Douer-Ambar set up a South Dakota trust in 2013, according to the files. However, less than a decade earlier in 2004, US, UK and Canadian authorities had announced the dismantling of a massive Colombian money-laundering ring in which Douer had been partly implicated.\nThe Colombian Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) laundered millions of dollars accrued by narcotics traffickers. US authorities alleged that Douer had repeatedly purchased millions of dollars in the BMPE system over a period of years. Douer, who died last year, agreed to forfeit $20m in connection with a deferred prosecution agreement and the settlement of a civil asset forfeiture action.\nPrior to establishing the new trust, Douer\u2019s trust provider made inquiries about his history. Douer\u2019s representative described his involvement in the BMPE scheme as an \u201cunfortunate experience\u201d in a reply to the offshore provider.\n\u201cThe case arose from a transfer of US$190,000.00 to a bank in the UK using a broker who had been highly recommended to Mr Douer as an honest person by other wealthy Colombians,\u201d the representative said. \u201cUnknown to Mr Douer the broker was unlicensed and had also received US dollars from persons involved in narcotraficking and that led to Mr Douer\u2019s problems.\u201d\nThat explanation appears to have been sufficient for the provider. Although the total sum sheltered in the trust is unclear, email correspondence suggests a previous entity linked to Douer contained as much as $100m.\nIn a separate 2019 case, a trust was settled by the family of Carlos Morales, the former vice-president of the Dominican Republic and chief executive of Central Romana, the largest sugar producer in the Dominican Republic. The trusts control assets of at least $14m. Morales died in 2014.\nTwo dozen plaintiffs tried to sue Central Romana via its US shareholder last year, accusing it of forcing workers and their families off their land at gunpoint and destroying their homes. In a separate legal case, Central Romana was accused of exposing workers to toxic chemicals while working in fields without protective gear.\nA spokesperson for Central Romana, Jorge Sturla, said US courts had dismissed both of the legal cases against the company. He said all employees were provided with PPE and that the firm had been defending its land against \u201csquatters\u201d and had never illegally evicted people.\nRecords in the Pandora papers show that the Morales family moved money to South Dakota in 2019, after the government of the Bahamas mandated the creation of an ownership database for legal entities.\nA lawyer for the Morales family told the ICIJ and the Washington Post they had never been involved in the operations of Central Romana. They did not respond to questions about why the family\u2019s assets had been shifted from the Bahamas.\nThe family behind the Isaias Group, an Ecuadorian conglomerate with interests in real estate, media companies and sugar production, are also using South Dakota to hold their assets.\nEst\u00e9fano Isa\u00edas, who co-owns the Isaias Group along with his brothers, is named as the beneficial owner of three trusts. Although the family is established in the US, and even made donations to the Obama campaign, it has also attracted controversy.\nEst\u00e9fano\u2019s brothers, Roberto and William, were convicted of embezzlement by an Ecuadorian court in 2012 following the collapse of Filanbanco, then one of the country\u2019s largest banks. The collapse wiped out the savings of ten of thousands of its customers and the brothers fled to Miami in 1999.\nThe brothers, who were briefly detained by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) in 2019 and released after posting a $1m bond, have long denied any wrongdoing in the Filanbanco debacle.\nIn a statement to the ICIJ, the Isa\u00edas brothers said the allegations and charges against them had been contrived by Ecuador\u2019s former president for political reasons.\n\u201cRoberto and William Isa\u00edas have been victims of unprecedented political persecution by Ecuador\u2019s corrupt authoritarian regime, which included the illegal seizure of all their assets and a show trial in absentia,\u201d they said.\nIn a statement to the ICIJ and the Washington Post, Bret Afdahl, the director of the South Dakota division of banking, which regulates financial services in the state, cited various measures his department could use in order to ensure compliance with state laws. He said trust company providers were vetted before they could begin operating.\nChuck Collins, the author of The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Pay Millions to Hide Trillions and the director of the programme on inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies, said the situation with regard to South Dakota was \u201can embarrassment\u201d for the US.\n\u201cWe are the weak link. And South Dakota is in a race to the bottom to be the weakest link on trusts,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWe have seen the hidden wealth apparatus but it is always considered offshore. The more we understand that it\u2019s onshore, the US is a weak link and we are now the magnet for kleptocratic capital the better for national understanding and the greater the potential for national legislation.\u201d",

The approach of all police forces, not just the Met, as to how they deal with \u201cminor crime\u201d is now under scrutiny. Such crime is only considered \u201cminor\u201d by the police and not by the victim, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have gone to the trouble of reporting it.\nWhile every day many officers and staff successfully conduct criminal investigations and go the extra mile for victims, this is not the case for all; you only have to report a crime considered by the police to be \u201clow level\u201d to realise this. Each crime is assessed based on its seriousness and its solvability, often by desk-based staff under pressure to file the case without further investigation. This \u201cdon\u2019t look too close\u201d approach means any evidence that potentially exists is not pursued or is ignored. In my experience, too many police officers and staff lack investigative professional curiosity, compounded by the fact that there is often a complete lack of challenge from first-line supervisors towards staff they consider as their mates, or where such scrutiny could attract accusations of bullying.\nIndividuals who commit serious crimes start somewhere, usually first committing minor crimes, and the police have to find some way of recognising this and doing something about it. David Taylor Paignton, Devon\n Priti Patel called Sarah Everard\u2019s killer a \u201cmonster\u201d.

        "content": "Readers respond to Jonathan Freedland\u2019s article on how Boris Johnson is rigging the system and trampling over democratic norms\nJonathan Freedland has probably written his most important opinion piece (In plain sight, Boris Johnson is rigging the system to stay in power, 1 October). The Tories are morphing into an explicitly neo-fascist party, encouraged by a sympathetic press and a supine BBC. Boris Johnson has purged more moderate Tories on the anvil of Brexit. Our pseudo-democratic first-past-the-post voting system has gifted Johnson an electoral dictatorship. The norms and values of our antiquated unwritten constitution are about to be butchered.\nWe cannot wait for Keir Starmer\u2019s long march back to electability. This political emergency requires a radical response. Progressive parties need to form an electoral alliance to reverse this threat to our democracy. All progressives can rally around an agenda to create a modern constitution with regional devolution and proportional representation at its heart, protected by a constitutional court.Philip WoodKidlington, Oxfordshire\n In light of Jonathan Freedland\u2019s article, I wonder if those libertarian Tory MPs, so exercised about what they see as the threat of Covid passports to their civil liberties, will continue to support the spurious introduction of photographic voter ID as a condition for exercising one\u2019s fundamental democratic right? Sadly, I suspect that they won\u2019t be moved to oppose a policy designed to disfranchise and further disempower those already under-represented by our political system. So much for civil liberties, let alone levelling up.\nUnfortunately, the lack of a written constitution in this country means that this and other proposed policies outlined in Freedland\u2019s article can all too easily be dressed up in the language of safeguarding the public interest or preventing vexatious behaviour, and passed with a series of votes in the interest of the majority party without the proper scrutiny necessitated by the requirements for a constitutional change. Instead we have a series of conventions, which work only when we have governments who are prepared to respect them.\nToo many people still regard Boris Johnson\u2019s unconventional behaviour as a breath of fresh air, when the reality is that there is a rotten stench at No 10.Ian Fraser Tregynon, Powys\n Jonathan Freedland is absolutely right to highlight the ways in which the current government is abusing its power to change election rules massively in their favour. In addition to the democracy-suppressing measures that Freedland mentions, the Conservatives also plan to massively increase how much they can spend in general elections. They plan to allow unlimited donations from abroad (if from UK citizens), even if they are tax exiles and haven\u2019t lived here for many decades. They also want to change spending rules to make it easier to target vast sums of money at marginal seats. What price democracy? Chris Rennard Liberal Democrat, House of Lords\n Jonathan Freedland sets out all the ways in which the Tories are rigging the system to stay in power. There is only one sure way to defeat this ploy and get them out of power. That is, all anti-Conservative progressive parties should agree that only one of their number should fight each seat which the Tories are in danger of winning at the next general election. This would probably produce enough seats for a progressive coalition to form a government.Graham Goddard Felinfoel, Carmarthenshire\n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

They\u2019re the most expensive people you can buy to do this kind of work.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAsked if the climate crisis would leave the ADF less prepared to respond to broader strategic challenges, such as China\u2019s military activities in the region, Barrie replied: \u201cLet\u2019s say we are headed to 3C [of warming] and we\u2019re finding our ADF is out there doing those kinds of work. If there\u2019s a defence emergency and they all bugger off, where are we left?\u201d\nThe Australian government\u2019s defence strategic update, published last year, warned of rising tensions between China and the US and said high-intensity conflict in the Indo-Pacific was \u201cless remote than in the past\u201d.\nThe document included only a passing reference to climate change, saying threats to human security \u201cwill be compounded by population growth, urbanisation and extreme weather events in which climate change plays a part\u201d.\nBarrie said he believed the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, were \u201cled by their US counterparts\u201d to include extensive comments about climate change in a joint statement issued after the annual Ausmin talks in Washington DC last month.\nThe statement also stressed the 2020s as a \u201ccritical decade\u201d, recognised \u201cthat the impacts of climate change at 1.5\u00b0C are much lower than at 2\u00b0C\u201d, and acknowledged \u201cthe global security threat posed by climate change\u201d. The US Department of Defense will now share its defence-related climate assessment tool with Australia.\nBarrie said that development \u201creinforces the view that the other players around the globe are concerned about Australia\u2019s position and they\u2019re doing their best to try and get Australia to do more before Glasgow\u201d.\nWhile domestic political debate in Australia has largely focused on Morrison\u2019s struggle to win support from the Nationals to firmly commit to net zero emissions by 2050, Barrie noted the need for deeper cuts this decade.\nBarrie believes that should include strengthening Australia\u2019s Tony Abbott-era pledge to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.\nThe Australian Security Leaders Climate Group argues Australia needs to mobilise \u201call the resources necessary to reach zero emissions as fast as possible\u201d, and Barrie said he believed the 2030 target should be more than 50%.\nThe comments come after a senior US climate official, Jonathan Pershing, said in August Australia should be considering a 50% cut by 2030, given the urgency of the threat posed by global heating.\nBarrie said the Australian government should look at the climate crisis in a similar way as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cWhat Covid is telling us is that everybody has to pull in the same direction, that it\u2019s not good enough for half the people to be vaccinated and for half of the people not to be vaccinated,\u201d Barrie said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for people to say, \u2018it doesn\u2019t actually matter what I do, I\u2019ll do what I damn well like, but everybody else better behave themselves\u2019. Because we are all on the planet together \u2013 we\u2019re all on earth together. And on climate change and on dealing with the pandemic, we need to all pull together.\u201d\nMorrison signalled to a group of metropolitan Liberals during a private briefing last week that he wanted to reach an agreement before Glasgow on both a policy roadmap and a 2050 net zero target, although some in the Nationals remain opposed.\nThe Morrison government is facing renewed calls to lift its more immediate climate goals, after New South Wales last week became the third state to set a target of cutting emissions roughly in half by the end of the decade compared with 2005 levels.\nSuch a target is consistent with what scientists say is necessary for the developed world to live up to the goals of the Paris agreement.",

The Australian has reported that Asio warned it could help the Chinese navy to hunt down Australian submarines but CSIRO said making that connection was \u201calarmist and irresponsible reporting\u201d.\nThe defence analyst Albert Palazzo, writing for the Lowy Institute, said China\u2019s technology will be advanced enough that \u201cany Australian submarine that attempts to do something in these waters, such as launch a tomahawk missile, will reveal its position and shortly thereafter be destroyed\u201d.\nOthers say submarines are just a base platform for a range of new and evolving technologies.\nMark Sander, the president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, said the boats will have critical capabilities in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as deterrence and attack.\nThere was a \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d in weapons systems, sensors and sensor processing, he said.\nFor example, the now defunct plan for French Attack-class submarines included optronic masts that can stealthily pop out of the water, gather data and pinpoint threats in just a few seconds. They can be used for electronic warfare, communications and spying.\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s outgoing head, Peter Jennings, said nuclear-propelled boats had more space and energy for being \u201cmotherships\u201d than conventional submarines.\n\u201cThey\u2019re significantly bigger and the reactors give you the energy not just for the propulsion but for everything else inside the boat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou then have a huge amount of space for weapons, for vertical launch tubes for cruise missiles and for autonomous systems that can be stored on board. Not only is it a fighting unit but you might have half a dozen remote systems fanned out at quite a distance. They\u2019ll be operating a long distance away from potential targets, potentially hundreds of kilometres.\n\u201cFrom the submarine they can control unmanned systems that could themselves be spread out over hundreds of kilometres in different directions including closer to a threat.\u201d\nSubmarines will also connect to and share information with surface ships and fighter jets.\nAccording to the taskforce set up under Aukus, the new submarines will have \u201csuperior characteristics of stealth, speed, manoeuvrability, survivability, and almost limitless endurance\u201d, with better weapons, the ability to deploy drones and \u201ca lower risk of detection\u201d.",

        "content": "The new king comes with a powerful alliance of kingmakers who can unite the Liberal factions, but can they sell themselves to the public?\nThe likely new leadership in New South Wales will be a government of the king and the kingmakers, a powerful alliance of next-generation political professionals who will pursue a conservative, pro-business agenda, albeit with a pale green tinge.\nDominic Perrottet, 39, Matt Kean, 40, and Stuart Ayres, also 40, have spent their entire lives in politics. All three are masters of its dark arts and together they will be able to unite the warring factions of the Liberal party that have undone other leaders in the past.\nBut whether this team can sell themselves to the public of NSW remains to be seen.\nPerrottet is quick-witted, but he is also a cutting, spiky character and not your everyman.\nHe also carries the baggage of the icare scandal, revealed by investigative journalist Adele Ferguson, to live down. She detailed how icare, which reports to the treasurer, had systematically underpaid injured workers and how executives had been rewarded with lavish paycheques.\nThe planning minister, Rob Stokes, is a far more easygoing character and a solid performer when it comes to policy. He is still challenging for the leadership, but stands little chance.\nThe Perrottet ticket did not announce until it had secured the numbers and will almost certainly be duly elected on Tuesday.\nStokes is likely to announce his resignation from politics by the next election and other long-serving MPs such as Brad Hazzard are expected to follow.\nBut what can we expect in terms of policy from the Perrottet team?\nPerrottet is a staunch conservative Catholic, father of six, and is one of 13 children. He is a leading member of the right and has been involved in factional politics since a young man, in the Young Liberals and later as a staffer for David Clarke, then as leader of the conservative right.\nPerrottet attended Redfield college, which has an Opus Dei priest as its chaplain, however Perrottet has said he is not a member of the ultra-conservative Catholic order.\nOn social issues, Perrottet is likely to be very conservative. He voted against decriminalisation of abortion in NSW last year, and will almost certainly oppose the assisted dying bill that independent Alex Greenwich plans to bring before parliament in October.\nLabor is planning to offer a conscience vote. Under John Barilaro, the Nationals had planned to support it. But with his departure there is no knowing whether supporters in the Nationals, such as Trevor Khan, can get the new leader to stick with this position. It has been reported that despite his personal opposition, Perrottet will allow Liberals a conscience vote on the bill.\nIf the bill does not pass, it will leave NSW as the only state where helping a terminally ill person end their life is a crime.\nAnother early indicator about how close Perrottet is to the Catholic church will be what happens to the state\u2019s cemeteries.\nOfficials within Investment NSW and the Department of Planning last week advised ministers to appoint one government body, known as OneCrown, to administer the assets of Sydney cemeteries.\nBut numerous senior government ministers are pushing for the \u201cadditional option\u201d of having the Catholic Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust remaining separate from OneCrown and giving it control of two of the most lucrative cemeteries \u2013 Varroville and Wallacia.\nThere has been no open tender, and other religious groups have opposed the transfer of the cemeteries to the CMCT.\nOn more pressing matters, such as the end of the Covid lockdown, Perrottet is likely to be unashamedly pro-business.\nHe denied he directly opposed the lockdown of NSW in July, saying it was his job to put the counter-argument about the impact on the economy. But others say he argued strongly against it.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAs NSW emerges from lockdown, residents can expect life under premier Perrottet to see a swift and more definitive path back to normal. Perrottet will be reluctant to see any backsliding, even if Covid case numbers spike, hospitals struggle and health officials want to slow it down.\nHe is also likely to be more pro-business \u2013 if that\u2019s possible, because Berejiklian\u2019s government was very pro-business.\nWhereas the planning minister, Rob Stokes, has championed open space, transport links and climate-sensitive design, tempering the natural impulses of NSW\u2019s powerful development lobby, Perrottet has not shown the same interest in better planning.\nThe massive Aerotropolis, on the edge of Sydney adjoining the second airport, is likely to be the test case.\nAlso controversial has been the Penrith Lakes project, which Ayres, the MP for Penrith, has championed. Flooding concerns have prompted planning officials to dramatically limit residential development, but Ayres has said in the past he would like to see more housing.\nThe new leadership is also likely to enthusiastically push ahead with raising the Warragamba dam wall, despite the loss of world heritage-listed national park. The environmental impact statement is now on exhibition. The flood mitigation measures will allow large swathes of western Sydney to be developed.\nOn other environmental issues, the outlook is less clear. As environment minister, Kean has led the way in mapping out NSW\u2019s pathway to net zero by 2050 and convinced his colleagues to embrace his plan for a major shift to renewables. The plan involves setting up renewable energy hubs and encouraging $32bn in private sector investment.\nAs the new treasurer, he is likely to continue pushing that agenda. However, he was less forthright on the expansion of coalmines, coal seam gas and mining more generally while environment minister. Under his watch as environment minister, the NSW government has given the go-ahead to Santos\u2019s Narrabri Gas project.\nAyres, who is married to the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, is Liberal moderate royalty. His elevation to deputy leader will help the Liberals cement their claim to be the party for the western suburbs of Sydney. Ayres is a popular local member in Penrith and well known in the region.\nThrough his long period as sports minister, he was close to the powerful pubs and clubs industry. He is an owner of racehorses and an enthusiast for racing.\nIn short, this will be a government that business will have no reason to fear.\nWhere it stands on the pressing environmental issues confronting the most populous state \u2013 land clearing, loss of threatened species, koala protections and water management \u2013 is less clear.\nIt will depend on whether the next Nationals leader can wield the same clout John Barilaro has over the last five years.\nLabor, who has also turned to its next generation in Chris Minns, should not underestimate this team.",

        "content": "Stephen Charles says he has lost all hope the Coalition is serious about introducing a strong federal anti-corruption commission\nFormer senior judge Stephen Charles has criticised Barnaby Joyce for likening the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog to the \u201cSpanish Inquisition\u201d, saying the deputy prime minister\u2019s comments were \u201cvery silly\u201d and showed the federal government had no desire to be held accountable for its own integrity failings.\nJoyce led the attacks on the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) on Monday, arguing it was working \u201cvery, very badly\u201d.\n\u201cThis is not the great righteous process, it\u2019s a little bit Spanish Inquisition. We elect politicians, not bureaucrats. People should be the final arbiter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bureaucracy reigns supreme here and politicians are basically terrified to do their job.\u201d\nJoyce was supported by fellow National Matt Canavan, who said he agreed \u201cwith that sentiment\u201d. The attacks on the commission follow earlier criticisms by former federal attorney general Philip Ruddock and the current NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard.\nCharles, who sat on the bench of Victoria\u2019s highest court for more than a decade, has been a prominent voice advocating for the commonwealth to create a federal anti-corruption commission with similar powers to the NSW Icac.\n\u201cThe Icac has almost certainly done exactly what the usual system requires, which is that there is a detailed private, in-camera investigation first, before they decide to call a public inquiry,\u201d Charles said.\n\u201cThe premier has been given notice of the matters that they are looking at investigating; they seem to be entirely proper matters for investigation.\n\u201cNow, to call this the Spanish Inquisition is really just a very silly comment.\u201d\nCharles, who now works with the Centre for Public Integrity, said he had lost all hope that the Coalition was serious about introducing a strong federal anti-corruption commission.\nThe government promised to set up a federal body prior to the last election but delayed doing so before announcing a model that was widely criticised for its weakness and narrow focus.\n\u201cThere is no prospect the present government will establish a national integrity commission that is effective; the model which they\u2019ve presently proposed, and which they\u2019ve done nothing to progress for years, is a hopeless model, which wouldn\u2019t be able to investigate politicians at all,\u201d Charles said.\nMuch of the criticism directed at Icac following Berejiklian\u2019s resignation on Friday has suggested it should not hold public hearings initially.\nOn Sunday, Hazzard said he had \u201cstrong views\u201d about Icac and questioned whether initial hearings should be held \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. Ruddock said Icac should operate in a similar manner to directors of public prosecutions \u2013 working privately to initially establish whether a person had a case to answer.\nBut Icac does have the power to hold private examinations and regularly does so prior to public hearings, including in Operation Keppel, the inquiry that is now investigating Berejiklian.\nThe premier said on Friday that Icac\u2019s timing was the worst possible. She criticised it for pursuing matters that had already been examined by the state opposition and through parliamentary inquiries.\nOn Monday, the deputy premier, John Barilaro, announced his own resignation. When asked why the timing was not similarly poor, given Berejiklian\u2019s comments, he distinguished the premier\u2019s role from his own and spoke of the \u201cteam\u201d around him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the premier of the day is the face of the government, steers the ship, holds the firm hand on the decisions and the direction,\u201d Barilaro said.",

Health authorities stress vaccination is still the most effective tool for preventing severe illness.\nMolnupiravir is a capsule that is taken twice a day for five days by adult patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 symptoms and does not need to be refrigerated, allowing it to be used in the community including rural areas.\nScott Morrison said \u201cvaccines and new treatments like this will boost our national plan to safely reopen Australia and keep Australia safely open\u201d.\n\u201cThroughout this pandemic we\u2019ve been closely watching developments for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments and molnupiravir will be ready to go in Australia should it be approved by the TGA,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe health minister, Greg Hunt, said \u201call Covid-19 treatment assessment processes are being treated with the greatest priority as part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic\u201d.\n\u201cVaccination remains the most important and safest way for Australians to protect themselves and their loved ones from Covid-19 \u2013 and almost 80% of Australians aged 16 and over have now had their first dose.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said there was \u201creally good early evidence\u201d that molnupiravir \u201ccan reduce your risk of severe illness by half\u201d, referring to the results of its phase three trials.\n\u201cThat is a really important intervention that could be part of a new class of drugs, antiviral drugs, that really change the face [of illness], in the same way that antiviral drugs for influenza mean that people get less severe illness,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne.\n\u201cAbsolutely, I would love to see that go through a TGA assessment and approval process. It is not there yet.\u201d\nSutton said although \u201cantivirals are great if you are developing illness regardless, but getting vaccinated will be 10, 20, 50 times more powerful an intervention in preventing severe illness than any antiviral that\u2019s currently available\u201d.\nOn Monday, Hunt announced Australia had purchased an extra 15,000 doses of sotrovimab, an intravenous antibody treatment shown to reduce hospitalisation or death by 79% in adults with mild to moderate Covid-19.\nHunt described taking molnupiravir orally as a \u201cmuch easier means of\u201d delivering treatments than intravenous infusion.",

While not all are anti-vaxxers, there are ways of recognising those who might be.\n\u201cIn our system we can often spot it, because we see rows of names and they won\u2019t put their Medicare card details in so we can\u2019t verify their health data,\u201d Haikerwal, a former federal president of the AMA, said.\n\u201cWe would call to confirm their visit \u2026 and they\u2019d fill you with expletives, so we stopped bothering.\u201d\nTo avoid vaccine doses going to waste, Haikerwal said the clinic had become \u201cmuch more careful\u201d about not drawing up for the last hour to reserve doses.\n\u201cWe only have a certain number of bookings, and it means people have to wait longer.\n\u201cThe people who most need to get a vaccine, the people we want to protect should be able to easily, it should be easy for them,\u201d he said.\nPrice said she encouraged \u201call practices to \u2026 do everything possible to avoid doses going to waste \u2026 don\u2019t let the anti-vaxxers get you down.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLast month, a Melbourne vaccination clinic which had been administering vaccines to vulnerable Victorians was forced to close for four days after staff were abused and spat on by protesters amid ongoing rallies in the CBD.\nA social media channel linked to the Melbourne protests with more than 13,000 members has since been sharing advice on how to avoid Victoria\u2019s extended vaccination mandate.\nIn July, a Geelong Advertiser article that revealed hundreds of Victorians weren\u2019t turning up to booked vaccination appointments was distributed as a call-to-action by anti-vaxxers, who shared the story across Facebook groups.\nBut emergency physician Dr Stephen Parnis said only a small minority of the vaccine-hesitant population \u201chardcore refused\u201d the jab and would be unlikely to be convinced otherwise.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t think with reason, it\u2019s emotion based,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe more we can target the hesitant group, the better outcomes will be,\u201d he said.\nVaccine hesitancy across Australia has continued to steadily fall and is now sitting at 15%, the latest Melbourne Institute data shows.\nThose \u201cunwilling\u201d to be vaccinated dropped from 9.4% in mid-September to 8.2% by the end of that month, while those \u201cunsure\u201d dropped from 7.3% to 6.8%.\nHesitancy among over 44-year-olds has remained stable, while vaccine uptake continues to increase fastest among 18-to-44-year-olds.\nParnis said it was \u201ccomforting\u201d to see the vaccination rate in Victoria reach 80% first doses for over 16-year-olds.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve had your first dose, you\u2019re highly likely to have your second. We\u2019re all pushing hard to see if we can get the rate above 90%,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Victoria\u2019s current roadmap, at 80% of double-dose targets, unvaccinated people with no reasonable excuse will be excluded from the majority of public life including pubs, clubs and restaurants.\nUnder the current NSW roadmap, unvaccinated people will remain restricted until 1 December, when 90% of adults are expected to be fully vaccinated. Proof of vaccination status to access public and private sector services won\u2019t be needed in the ACT once the territory opens up due to high levels of vaccination.\nParnis said opening public life to the unvaccinated would depend on extremely high vaccination rates among the eligible community.\n\u201cThe issue we have is the vaccine isn\u2019t perfect, it doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk of getting infected, and it doesn\u2019t eliminate risk of transmitting,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t entertain it until you have penetration rates above 90%.

A cabinet minister told the Guardian Johnson had warned colleagues he was not keen on pursuing a culture war, after No 10 was stung by the row over the England football team taking the knee, in which some ministers appeared to condemn the gesture.\nSeveral senior figures have ploughed on regardless, however, including Dorries. The party co-chair Oliver Dowden used his conference speech to condemn what he called \u201cwoke aggression\u201d, claiming the Labour party has \u201cwoke running through it like a stick of Brighton rock\u201d.\nMichael Gove, who heads the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, used his speech to condemn what he called \u201ca militant left who want to denigrate our past and divide us in the future\u201d.\nIn her interview on Monday, Dorries claimed that criticism of her surprise appointment to her new job was \u201ctotal, pure, leftwing snobbery\u201d and that people who criticised her bestselling novels were \u201cinsulting 2.4 million people\u201d who bought them.\nSaying the arts were dominated by people who went to private school or \u201chave a connection with the BBC\u201d, Dorries said: \u201cWhat really infuriated me was all these people who were criticising me were those people \u2026 who found themselves where they were through a privileged background, through nepotism and whole other reasons.\u201d\nDorries said the BBC in particular had \u201ca kind of groupthink\u201d that excluded people from working-class or northern backgrounds, adding: \u201cIf you\u2019re only taking people from one kind of background you end up in a groupthink scenario.\u201d\nThe BBC made no comment in response, but said it was the first broadcaster to measure socioeconomic diversity; that of its entire workforce for whom there was data, 11.5% went to private schools; and that it was investing heavily in recruiting people from a broad range of backgrounds.\nIn contrast, 60% of the cabinet in which Dorries serves attended private schools.\nDorries denied the idea she was seeking a culture war: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to war with anybody. Where it\u2019s quoted is with my relationship the BBC. And that\u2019s not the case. I don\u2019t want to go to war. But what I want to do is to have constructive dialogue with the BBC: how are you going to change?\u201d\nAsked if there would still be a licence fee in 10 years, Dorries replied: \u201cWill the BBC still be here in 10 years? I don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t look into the future. It is a very competitive environment.\u201d\nShe dropped a strong hint that she would like to press ahead with the proposed privatisation of Channel 4. \u201cChannel 4 is in a good place at the moment, but if Channel 4 wants to grow and it wants to be successful, then it needs to change,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the obvious ways of doing that is for Channel 4 to privatise.\u201d",

        "content": "The theatre director and lantern-maker Hilary Hughes, my friend and colleague, who has died aged 72, shortly after contracting Covid-19, made an international impact on the world of outdoor and carnival arts, while remaining fully involved in her adopted hometown of Stoke-on-Trent.\nHilary\u2019s career, which spanned more than 50 years, started while she was studying art and drama at Bingley College in West Yorkshire. A college production was being looked at by the National Youth Theatre assessor Peter Sykes. Hilary became lighting designer and stage manager for his Edinburgh fringe shows, and was soon a key member of Sykes\u2019 Ritual and Tribal theatre, one of the radical, experimental companies to come out of the University of Keele. She met her life companion, Gill Gill, in 1973, while with the company.\nThe company\u2019s female members, Gill, Hilary and Yvon Appleby, became disillusioned with the male focus of the work, and in 1985 formed the UK\u2019s first female-led outdoor arts company, Beavers, \u201cspecifically to work together as women \u2026 at women\u2019s festivals, in women\u2019s centres, community centres, schools, refuges \u2013 anywhere that women meet\u201d.\nHilary performed in Beavers\u2019 first show, Cloudwalking, in 1985, which told the story of the \u201cLadies\u2019 Expedition to the High Sierra Mountains\u201d, and the intense relationship the three female climbers Vera Aspinall, Elizabeth Paterson and Kit Anderson formed on their climb.\nAlongside this, Beavers were commissioned to create original street theatre for the Stoke garden festival. I joined the company in 1985 to create The Weird Sisters of Char \u2013 a family of roving tea ladies. After Yvon left, Gill, Hilary and I became co-directors, as well as lifelong friends. We toured outdoor arts festivals (Glastonbury, Hat Fair), and ran workshops at summer play schemes across the UK.\nBeavers was renamed B arts in the mid-1990s. Hilary trained hundreds of artists, writers, musicians and community members in making participatory outdoor theatre, street performance and celebratory arts.\nOutside Beavers, Hilary was a key team member for Cumbria-based Welfare State International, and worked as a lantern-maker, production and project manager, and pyrotechnician with Theatre of Fire and Emergency Exit Arts in the UK, Europe and the US.\nHilary toured work internationally for B arts, most notably making a lantern parade in Mostar in 1995, just after the Bosnian war had ended. She brought this international experience back to Stoke, working with refugees dispersed to the city.\nIn 2013, she was made an honorary doctor of Staffordshire University, and the citation recognised her work with refugees and migrant communities in North Staffordshire and in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nBorn in Bromborough, Cheshire, to John, a teacher, who had been a Spitfire pilot during the second world war, and Audrey, a nurse, Hilary had a brother, Peter, who predeceased her.\nB arts is still going strong. Gill died in 2006; Hilary and I continued to give consideration to how she would have thought about new work.",

        "content": "South Africa\u2019s World-Cup winning captain discusses losing himself in alcohol and strip clubs, seeing his mother\u2019s face change from repeated beatings and his dream of emulating Richie McCaw \n\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know how to speak,\u201d Siya Kolisi says simply as he reveals his often hidden struggle to cope with a life that has been challenging and extreme. As a boy in the townships Kolisi endured acute hunger and witnessed terrible violence and even death.\nHe was a gifted rugby player, however, and a scholarship to a white school offered him sudden opportunities and privileges. After years of struggle and hard work, Kolisi became the Springboks\u2019 first black captain in their troubled rugby history. In 2019, he led them to World Cup glory and he was venerated for his role on and off the field.\nYet as he admits now, and in his moving new book, Kolisi always battled to articulate how he really felt. He tried to escape his confusion and hurt by drinking, going to strip clubs, watching pornography and losing himself in a hazy maze.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to speak for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m learning as I go along with my wife. We\u2019re five years into our marriage and I\u2019m still learning how to have a proper conversation with her. That\u2019s why I put in [the book] the things I did in the past, some of the vulnerability, so it can tell the true story.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m someone\u2019s role model. The kid will think: \u2018I want to be like you one day.\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t know the struggles you face. No one tells him there\u2019s temptation \u2013 alcohol, drugs, all these things are available to you.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d had a mentor that told me you\u2019re going to face these challenges and you must be prepared to fight them. I had to go through the hard way. Now I want to make sure the next kid and his family can read the book and think: \u2018How will we prevent that? How will we prepare you for that kind of life?\u2019\n\u201cSome people also know how I was in the past and I\u2019m not a saint at all. I\u2019m a sinner trying to be the best he can be every day.\u201d\nWhen he remembers the intense hunger he felt almost every day in the black township of Zwide, in Port Elizabeth, Kolisi describes it as \u201call consuming \u2026 the more I tried to ignore the pain, the worse it got\u201d.\nWhile he highlights the laughter and excitement he also experienced in Zwide, he was 12 when he watched a man being stoned to death.\nOn a Zoom call from Australia, where he was preparing to lead South Africa to an epic 31-29 victory over New Zealand, I ask Kolisi if it has been painful revisiting those desperate days. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to relive some memories. I remember losing my grandmother and her dying in my arms. She was the closest person to me and I was not even 10 years old. But at the same time it\u2019s a beautiful thing. I\u2019m the person I am today because of every sacrifice she made and I\u2019m glad I was the one who held her as she died. I see so much beauty in it.\u201d\nKolisi remembers looking at photographs of his mother when she was young \u2013 before she gave birth to him at 18. He describes her as \u201cbeautiful and, most of all, unscarred. I never saw her look like that because her face changed so much from the different men beating her up \u2026 when she died she had scars all over her face.\u201d\nWhen he was five years old, and playing in the streets, he picked up a couple of his mother\u2019s teeth, which had been knocked out during another beating.\nTwenty-five years later, having just got back from shopping on the Gold Coast for presents for his children in South Africa, Kolisi says he saw the photographs of his young and unmarked mother \u201cafter she had passed. I showed them to my younger brother and he said: \u2018That looks nothing like her.\u2019 That broke me. But, even through the hurt, she\u2019ll always be beautiful to me.\u201d\nKolisi looks up. \u201cI see some of the men who beat her in the streets when I go home and it hurts that nothing ever happened to them. I see this one guy and I remember the day I watched him beat up my mother. I get so angry but I must control myself.\u201d\nHas he spoken to the man? \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t talk to him.\u201d\nKolisi started drinking and sniffing petrol before he was 10 and he stresses rugby and his first coach, Eric Songwiqi at African Bombers, a township club, saved him. \u201cI met Coach Eric when I was 12. He also coached at another school and they beat my team 50-0. But after the game he said he saw something special in me. He asked me to move to his school.\u201d\nSongwiqi arranged for Kolisi and two other Zwide boys to go on a scholarship to Grey School \u2013 a leading white rugby school. \u201cThere were three of us but I was very small,\u201d Kolisi says. \u201cI had malnutrition. So he forced [Grey] and said: \u2018If you want these two you have to take this one [Kolisi points to himself].\u201d\nHe could not speak much English and was plunged into a world of immense privilege. \u201cIt was hard and embarrassing at times. I felt stupid and would run away from the other kids because I couldn\u2019t speak. But I love people so much that I started to speak broken English. The boys would laugh but I kept on.\n\u201cI made a friend, Nick Holton, who is still my best mate. He taught me how to speak English and helped me a lot. It was really tough but I was also getting fed good food for the first time in my life. I thought: \u2018I cannot let this opportunity go.\u2019 I knew this could be the ticket for my family.\u201d\nThe sudden change in his life \u201crevealed that the world is unfair. It was just a 15-minute drive [from Zwide to Grey] and that\u2019s all it took for me to start dreaming differently. I knew I\u2019d left so many talented players, who were probably better than me, in the township. It\u2019s unfair because they were starved of that opportunity.\u201d\nKolisi made his Test debut in June 2013. He was 22 and he came on as a substitute after four minutes against Scotland. South Africa were 17-6 down but after Kolisi turned in a man-of-the-match performance they won 30-17.\nIt still took a long time to establish himself in the starting XV and at the 2015 World Cup he barely played. He lost himself in drink \u2013 so much so that Rachel, whom he married a year later, left the UK a week early.\nWere his drinking problems a way of escaping his painful past? \u201cDefinitely. I drank when I was happy or sad, or dealing with something. Drinking was the only way I knew to get through this stuff.\u201d\nIn his book Kolisi explains it was only at the start of 2019, in World Cup year, that Rachel persuaded him to find a Christian mentor, Ben Schoeman, who spoke in blunt terms: \u201cSiya, you drink a lot, you fool around with women, you go to strip clubs. You post on social media about your faith in Christ, but you\u2019re lying to yourself and everyone else.\u201d\nKolisi met Schoeman when \u201cmy sin was exposed\u201d. He says: \u201cI started opening up to him and we spoke deeply. He told me I needed to stop drinking. It was tough at the beginning but now I don\u2019t miss it.\u201d\nIn being so open does he worry about tarnishing his image as a Mandela-style figure in South African rugby? \u201cNo, because that\u2019s me and I want to encourage people that it\u2019s OK to look for help. Too many people commit suicide out of desperation because they\u2019re too proud to talk to someone else. I want to encourage men to speak because they don\u2019t talk to each other. Men don\u2019t open up or want to cry. Men want to look strong at all times. But life is not about that. You can\u2019t carry all that weight because it can break you.\u201d\nThe night before the 2019 Rugby World Cup final, \u201cRachel and me sat outside our room in the corridor because our kids were sleeping. We wrote down our goals to help others.\u201d\nIt sounds an unusual way to prepare for a momentous match but Kolisi and the Springboks carried an almost divine conviction they would win the World Cup. They never looked in any danger of losing to England, who had been clear favourites.\nThere was joy across South Africa but Kolisi stresses sport cannot change a brutal reality. On any given day in South Africa an average of 58 people are murdered and 114 women are raped. He resolved to talk about gender violence as his primary topic of concern in public.\n\u201cYou win the World Cup and get given a platform. Rachel said: \u2018You couldn\u2019t help your mother or your aunt but you can help other women.\u2019 She was right. Gender violence hurts me even if I am a man. I have my own daughter, my wife and my sister. I would never want them to suffer this violence.\u201d\nDoes pornography fuel gender violence? \u201cI\u2019m not a professional so I don\u2019t really want to get into that. But I know it [pornography] was a problem for me. I can\u2019t say more than that.\u201d\nHe is also reluctant to discuss the way Rassie Erasmus, the World Cup-winning coach and now the Springboks\u2019 director of rugby, released his videos criticising the officials during the bruising recent series against the Lions. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go over that. I don\u2019t like drama.\n\u201cBut it was such a tough series because of all the things happening off the field. We were stuck in the bubble, I was getting over Covid and we lost the first Test. There was lots of drama and I felt the pressure.\n\u201cBefore the second Test I started crying in an interview. They asked me a simple question: \u2018What would you tell your nine-year-old self?\u2019 I was not crying because of the question. It was because of the intense pressure.\u201d\nKolisi describes victory over the Lions as second only to winning the World Cup. His sporting dream is that he and the Springboks will equal Richie McCaw and the All Blacks by becoming the second captain and country to retain the World Cup.\nThe magnificent Springbok win on Saturday over the All Blacks, with Kolisi an industrious inspiration again, bolsters his conviction. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in the group and I do believe it\u2019s possible. But we have a lot to get right and then we go to Europe in November.\u201d\nHe has been in Australia for two months, for the Rugby Championship, so Kolisi has taken a brief break from therapy. \u201cI have missed it a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes a break is good but it will be even better to go back and talk some more. It always helps to talk.\u201d\nRise by Siya Kolisi is published by Harper Collins\n This article was amended on 5 October 2021 to clarify that the school attended by Siya Kolisi was Grey School in Port Elizabeth, not Gray\u2019s College in Bloemfontein as was implied in an earlier version.",

It is largely confined to Queensland, although earlier this year the mosquito was detected in the Northern Territory.\nSuppressing its numbers was unlikely to have any major negative ecological effects, Beebe said.\n\u201cIt only exists in urban landscapes. It preferentially bites humans, like 95% of the time. The urban landscape is a pretty artificial ecosystem, so removing a mosquito from that ecosystem is probably not going to be a problematic issue.\u201d\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquito is found in tropical areas in more than 120 countries and infects millions of people globally with viruses each year. The number of dengue cases reported to the World Health Organization has increased by more than eight-fold globally over the past two decades.\nResearchers have previously infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with different strains of Wolbachia bacteria to reduce the mosquitoes\u2019 likelihood of transmitting viruses that affect humans.\nA World Mosquito Program trial in Indonesia last year found that infecting mosquitoes with the bacteria reduced the number of dengue infections in Yogyakarta city by 77% compared to untreated areas. An earlier trial in Townsville found the technique was successful in preventing dengue outbreaks.\nIn those studies, both male and female mosquitoes were infected with the bacteria.\nWolbachia is unlikely to have any effect if a human is bitten by an infected female mosquito, Beebe said. \u201cThere\u2019s experimental evidence and observation evidence that these Wolbachia [bacteria] cannot invade human cells.\u201d\nThe team plans to use a similar technique to suppress the virus-spreading Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, an \u201cincredibly pestiferous\u201d species that has established itself in the Torres Strait Islands since 2004.\n\u201cWe want to build our own sterile male system so that when this mosquito gets on to the mainland, we can kick it off,\u201d Beebe said.\nMosquito suppression programs are also under way for other species in French Polynesia and the Hunter region of New South Wales.",

The audience space is expected to be significantly bigger and Boris Johnson will give his speech in the round, surrounded by ministers and activists.\nCabinet ministers privately admitted they were surprised at the main space, which seats 600 people and has doors open to the exhibition hall that are next to speakers for fringe meetings hosted directly outside the hall. In comparison, the main auditorium where Labour held its conference at the Brighton Centre holds 3,000 people.\nThe room was full for Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech on Monday afternoon, with the audience spilling out of the doors. But the chancellor was forced to slightly delay the start of his address because of competing noise from a fringe meeting outside the hall.\nIt is understood that senior staff had decided on a smaller venue because of the pandemic and uncertainty as to whether many party members would attend. In fact, numbers have exceeded previous years, and the party has accredited more than 10,000 people.\nOne minister said there had been surprise at the size of the hall when they and cabinet colleagues arrived in Manchester. \u201cThe noise was so loud during Liz\u2019s speech that people didn\u2019t realise when she had finished,\u201d they said. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a pause in the speech for applause or laughter, it\u2019s being drowned out.\u201d\nCabinet ministers have had little major policy to announce during the conference, apart from well-trailed announcements of an extension to job support and cash for tennis courts. All significant spending announcements or policies \u2013 including the promise to make all the UK\u2019s power green by 2035 \u2013 has been allocated to the prime minister.\nDowden may have ruffled feathers further when he tried to fire up people hoping to stand as candidates, but told them: \u201cWe are all just bit players.\u201d He said that when the next election is called, the party would \u201crelease our prize stallion, our rampaging rhino\u201d \u2013 a reference to Johnson.",

Nascar tried to dry the track for nearly 45 minutes, but up against sundown and the rain not showing any signs of ceasing, the race was called off.\nWallace had been waiting atop his pit stand for Nascar to make a decision and exploded in celebration with his crew when the race was called at the hallowed Alabama track. Wallace is in his first season driving for 23X1 Racing, a team owned by both Denny Hamlin and Michael Jordan.\nHe\u2019s the first Black driver to win at Nascar\u2019s elite Cup level since Wendell Scott in 1963 \u2013 a race where he wasn\u2019t declared the victor for several months. Nascar at last presented Scott\u2019s family with his trophy from that race two months ago.\nWallace broke down in tears after he\u2019d returned to his parked No 23 Toyota. The car number was picked for co-owner Jordan, who wore 23 in the NBA.\n\u201cThis is for all the kids out there that want to have an opportunity and whatever they want to achieve, and be the best at what they want to do,\u201d Wallace said as he choked back tears. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go through a lot of (BS). But you always got to stick true to your path and not let the nonsense get to you.\n\u201cStay strong. Stay humble. Stay hungry. Been plenty of times when I wanted to give up.\u201d\nBill Lester, a Black driver who raced intermittently in NASCAR from 1999 through one Trucks Series start this season, tweeted his congratulations to Wallace.\nFinally, it's official, you've done it! Congratulations @BubbaWallace. So proud of you and what you've accomplished. Your win moves the @NASCAR needle forward on so many fronts. Glad I was a witness. @23XIRacing #BLM\n\u201cFinally, it\u2019s official, you\u2019ve done it!\u201d he posted. \u201cSo proud of you and what you\u2019ve accomplished. Your win moves the @NASCAR needle forward on so many fronts. Glad I was a witness.\u201d\nIn June 2020 at Talladega, Nascar discovered a noose in the garage stall assigned to Wallace. The finding came just a week after Nascar had banned the Confederate flag at its events at Wallace\u2019s urging.\nThe FBI investigated and found that the noose was tied at the end of the garage door pull and Wallace was not a victim of a hate crime. The entire industry rallied around him, though, and stood in solidarity with Wallace at his car at the front of the grid before the race.\nThe flag ban has been an issue at Talladega, where a convoy of vehicles has paraded up and down Speedway Boulevard outside the main entrance of the speedway in all four race weekends since NASCAR said it would not permit the symbol inside its tracks. The convoy was back this weekend and included one car pulling a trailer that contained a Civil War-era cannon.\nWallace has called the noose incident a low point in his life. He\u2019s been subjected to nonstop online harassment that last year even included a tweet from then-US president Donald Trump that falsely accused Wallace of making up the noose.\n\u201cHas @BubbaWallace apologised to all of those great Nascar drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?\u201d the president tweeted in July 2020.\nReferring to Nascar\u2019s decision to ban the display of the Confederate flag at its events, the president added: \u201cThat & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!\u201d\nIn fact, Nascar\u2019s television ratings had risen over the previous two months.\nTrump\u2019s tweet echoed conspiracy theories aimed at Wallace. An FBI investigation found the driver was not a victim of a hate crime and the noose had been fashioned as a door pull last fall, long before his team had been assigned the garage at Talladega.\nQuite why Wallace should have to apologise is a mystery: he did not find or report the noose. One of Wallace\u2019s fellow drivers, Tyler Reddick, duly pushed back at the president.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need an apology,\u201d wrote Reddick. \u201cWe did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.\u201d\nWallace himself responded to Trump later on Monday in a message on Twitter addressed to \u201cthe next generation and little ones following my foot steps.\u201d\nWallace urged those looking to him as an example to \u201ckeep your head held high and walk proudly on the path you have chosen.\u201d Wallace concluded the message, \u201cAlways deal with the hate being thrown at you with LOVE. Love over hate every day. Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate. Even when it\u2019s HATE from the POTUS.\u201d\nWallace\u2019s win on Monday was his first in 142 career Cup starts, though he had six victories in the Truck Series from 2013 through 2015.\nNo playoff drivers won a race at Talladega this weekend and only Hamlin is already locked into the third round of the playoffs headed into next week\u2019s elimination race at Charlotte, North Carolina.\nHamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 winner, celebrated with Wallace following his seventh-place finish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just way more emotional because I know how difficult it is. These guys have worked so hard over the last 10 months to put this team together,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the beginning stages of our team. We\u2019re still growing. We\u2019ve got some great things on the horizon. It\u2019s just a great morale booster for everyone.\u201d\nBrad Keselowski finished second and was followed by Team Penske teammate Joey Logano in a pair of Fords. Busch was fourth in a Chevrolet.\nKevin Harvick, Christopher Bell, Alex Bowman and William Byron head to Charlotte in danger of elimination.",

        "content": "Harold Koh, a legal adviser and Obama administration veteran, criticises use of health protocol to expel thousands of migrants\nA senior legal adviser in the state department has accused the Biden administration of deporting Haitians illegally through the use of a public health law.\nHarold Koh, a veteran of the Obama administration, had been due to leave government service to take up a teaching position at Oxford University. He wrote a letter to the state department leadership, lambasting the expulsions of thousands of Haitians in recent weeks.\nThe 2 October letter reflects widespread unease in the state department at the recent treatment of Haitian migrants who had crossed the US-Mexico border and gathered in Texas seeking admission to the US \u2013 but were summarily put on planes and flown back to the unstable country they had fled.\nHaiti has been rendered particularly dangerous of late by the July assassination of the president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, and a subsequent powerful earthquake.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discontent,\u201d an administration source said. \u201cHis views are pretty widespread within the state department.\u201d\nLess than two weeks ago, the US special envoy for Haiti, Daniel Foote, resigned over the issue and sent a resignation letter excoriating the administration for its \u201cinhumane\u201d mass deportation of Haitian migrants and asylum seekers to what he said was a highly dangerous \u201ccollapsed state\u201d.\nJoe Biden had continued using a mechanism introduced by Donald Trump, summarily expelling migrants, mostly from Haiti, under Title 42 of the 1944 Public Health and Service Act, a previously obscure piece of legislation that presented the Covid pandemic as a reason not to provide due process to asylum seekers from Haiti and Central America.\n\u201cI write first, because I believe this administration\u2019s current implementation of the Title 42 authority continues to violate our legal obligation not to expel or return \u2026individuals who fear persecution, death, or torture, especially migrants fleeing from Haiti,\u201d Koh wrote in his letter, first published by Politico.\nHe referred to the country\u2019s legal obligations under the Convention against Torture and a 1967 protocol on the status of refugees.\nKoh pointed out that the chaos in Haiti had led the administration to extend temporary protected status to Haitians already in the US. There were no grounds therefore, he argued, to expel new arrivals and fly them straight into a life-threatening situation.\nThe expelled Haitians are not screened for fears of persecution unless they assert those fears vocally, in what has come to be known as the \u201cshout test\u201d.\n\u201cIn my legal opinion, as former state department legal adviser and as former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, the \u201cshout test\u201d and the higher screening standard inevitably create an unacceptably high risk that a great many people deserving of asylum will instead likely be returned to countries where they fear persecution, death, or torture,\u201d Koh wrote.\nThe state department said that the decision to use Title 42 was in the hands of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal health agency.\n\u201cTitle 42 is a public health authority, not an immigration one, and that authority rests with the CDC,\u201d a senior state department official said. \u201cWe defer to the CDC on decisions related to Title 42.\n\u201cThe CDC has determined that the expulsion of certain individuals under Title 42 is necessary due to the risks of transmission and spread of Covid-19 in congregate settings, such as US Customs and Border Protection stations, as well as the threat from emerging variants.\n\u201cThe United States remains committed to supporting safe, orderly and humane migration throughout our region,\u201d the official said.\nWhen the use of Title 42 was first used by the Trump administration, however, it was opposed by the CDC\u2019s own medical experts and forced on the agency by the then vice-president, Mike Pence.\nOlivia Troye, a former top Pence aide, resigned in protest and said the policy was authored by Stephen Miller, a Trump adviser who led that administration\u2019s anti-immigrant drive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept the notion that this is just a health issue unconnected to broader US immigration policy,\u201d said Michael Posner, a former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour.\n\u201cIt seems to me that there\u2019s a relatively straightforward way to address it if somebody poses a health risk on arrival in the US,\u201d Posner, who now runs the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, said.\n\u201cThey can be quarantined, they can be treated medically. It doesn\u2019t mean that they need to be deported.\u201d",

It found that one such mass bleaching event in 1998 led to the loss of 8% of the world\u2019s coral, or about 6,500 sq km, with the biggest impact observed in the Indian Ocean, Japan and the Caribbean.\nExperts said the decline of the last decade came amid continuous raised sea surface temperatures. They called for urgent action and said climate breakdown was the biggest threat to the world\u2019s reefs.\nHowever, the report also offers signs of hope. Scientists found that despite the stresses reefs were under, many remained resilient and had the potential to recover under the right conditions, particularly if action was taken immediately to halt global heating.\n\u201cThe news is mixed,\u201d said Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. \u201cThere are clearly unsettling trends toward coral loss, and we can expect these to continue as warming persists. Despite this, some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs.\n\u201cA clear message from the study is that climate change is the biggest threat to the world\u2019s reefs, and we must all do our part by urgently curbing global greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating local pressures.\u201d\nCoral reefs cover just 0.2% of the ocean floor but are home to at least a quarter of all marine species. They provide a vital habitat, as well as an important source of protein, medicines, food and jobs as well as protection from storms and erosion for millions of people.\nWhile in the last decade mass bleaching events have been so close frequent there has not been time for coral to recover, scientists noticed some revival in 2019 when reefs regained 2% of coral cover. This, they say, raises hope that if the factors putting pressure on reef ecosystems ease, there is potential to recover within a decade to pre-1998 levels.\nOther pressures on coral come from overfishing, unsustainable development on coasts and declining water quality.\nThe latest findings follow a separate analysis last month that revealed the world\u2019s coral reef cover had halved since the 1950s.",

The Navotas mudflats and mangroves in Manila Bay are buried in a thick layer of rubbish.\nIt is \u201calmost choking the mangrove roots,\u201d Diuvs de Jesus, a marine biologist in the Philippines who photographed the area on a recent visit, said.\nThe wetlands are of huge environmental significance. They provide a crucial feeding ground for migratory birds, offer protection against floodwater and help tackle climate change by absorbing far greater levels of carbon dioxide than mountain forests.\nThe plastic pollution, though, could devastate the area. Mangroves have special roots, known as pneumatophores, \u201csort of like a snorkel that helps them breathe in when sea water rises,\u201d says Janina Castro, member of the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines and advocate for wetland conservation. Plastic risks suffocating pneumatophores, weakening, and potentially killing the trees.\nThe mudflats and mangroves are already one of the last of their kind in Manila Bay, an area that was once lined with lush, green shrubs and trees. Manila is thought to have been named after the Nilad, a stalky rice plant that grows white flowers, and which once thrived along the coastline. At the end of the 19th century, there were up to 54,000 hectares of mangrove wetlands along the bay, according to an estimate cited by Pemsea, a regional, marine protection partnership coordinated by the United Nations. By 1995 this had fallen to fewer than 800 hectares.\nToday, Manila, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, is more likely to be associated with traffic jams than flourishing mangroves.\n\u201cIf only we banned single-use plastics, that will greatly reduce the litter,\u201d De Jesus said. He worries also about the looming threat of reclamation \u2013 where coastlines are extended outwards as rock, cement and earth are used to build new land in the sea.\nThe Navotas mangroves and mudflats are vital to the survival of migratory birds that visit the Philippines as part of the east Asian-Australasian flyway \u2013 a route that stretches from Arctic Russia and North America down to Australia and New Zealand.\nA number of endangered birds have been spotted feeding and resting in the wetlands, including the black-faced spoonbill, the far eastern curlew, and the great knot. The critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebird was also recently seen flying low over Navotas, Castro says.\nEnvironmentalists fear plastic pollution could ultimately harm such species. It breaks down into microplastics, which can be eaten by fish and shellfish \u2013 and, consequently, also be ingested by birds. It can also lead to an accumulation of toxic chemicals, and act as a vector for disease, threatening birds and their prey, Castro said.\n\u201cA number of these species currently have conservation efforts happening in other countries, but these efforts need to be mirrored in all of the staging sites including the Philippines,\u201d Castro said.\nThere is a misconception that mudflats are not as valuable or aesthetically pleasing as other types of wetlands, Castro said. But they play an important role in tourism, providing livelihoods and offering wave protection. \u201cEducating the public about these benefits is critical for its survival,\u201d she said.",

There\u2019ll be a lot on here,\u201d Morrison told 4BC radio.\nThe UK\u2019s high commissioner to Austalia, Vicki Treadell, has said the UK would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if Morrison did not attend the summit.\nThe government is still negotiating its new climate change policy internally, with a crucial meeting with the Nationals later this month to thrash out the government\u2019s commitment to a net-zero by 2050 target.\nIt has previously committed to updating both its long-term and 2030 emissions reduction targets of 26-28% cut on 2005 levels, which Australia agreed to six years ago under the Paris agreement.\nThe target has been widely criticised as not consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement, which aimed to to hold global heating to below 2C, with an aspiration not to breach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nLiberal MPs in metropolitan seats are pushing for both a net zero by 2050 target and a roadmap to reach it that would outline shorter-term milestones, but face resistance from a clutch of Nationals MPs, mostly from Queensland, who are firmly against the net zero target.\nAdding to the pressure on the federal Coalition, the New South Wales government last week agreed to a new target to cut emissions from 35% to 50% compared with 2005 levels by 2030.\nMorrison said difficult decisions were needed, and he was attempting to bring the government together on a plan to reduce emissions and transition to a new economy, \u201cwhich is coming\u201d.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t avoid these difficult questions, and it does require a lot of debate internally to work it through together,\u201d Morrison said.\n\u201cOur plan will set out how we\u2019ll get there, not just why we\u2019ll get there and when we get there, it\u2019s the how that matters, because it\u2019s the how that determines what the costs are, how we protect jobs, how we ensure that the Australian economy remains strong into the future,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI want to keep those jobs in rural and regional Australia. We\u2019re going to get there through technology, not higher taxes. That can absolutely be achieved and we can do the right thing by future generations.\u201d",

She repeated an explanation she gave for her approval of the Vickery mine extension near Gunnedah and the expansion of underground mining at the Russell Vale Colliery near Wollongong.\nLey wrote that she had accepted advice from her department that the Mangoola development was \u201cnot likely to cause harm to human safety because, if the proposed action is not approved, there is no reason to believe that a comparable amount of coal would not be consumed in substitution of the proposed action\u2019s coal\u201d.\n\u201cTherefore, I considered that the proposed action will not necessarily result in an increase to global GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions,\u201d she said.\nLey has lodged an appeal in the Sharma case.\nGeorgina Woods, the Lock the Gate Alliance\u2019s New South Wales coordinator, said the project had been opposed by Muswellbrook council and local landholders due to its unacceptable social and environmental impacts. She said the Morrison government\u2019s decision to approve it showed a lack of regard for the welfare of the local community.\n\u201cThis is the third coal mining project the Australian government has approved in recent weeks despite a recent federal court judgment acknowledging the harm such projects will do to human health, and particularly to children,\u201d she said.\n\u201cComing as it does just a month before pivotal global climate change negotiations, it is frankly alarming to witness this country digging itself deeper into its obstinate refusal to take climate change and rural sustainability seriously.\n\u201cThis decision is the result of the Morrison government\u2019s refusal to have any kind of valid climate change policy and it will be Australian children and rural communities that will pay the price.\u201d\nUnder the project plans, the expansion would have a 623-hectare footprint. White said the new pit would leave an 82 ha void in the landscape.\n\u201cIt beggars belief, really,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems there is such a large, permanent, negative environmental impact for such a short-term gain for so few.\u201d\nGlencore said it had invested more than five years in detailed studies and consultation for the project, which would create more than 100 construction jobs and secure ongoing employment for Mangoola\u2019s workforce of approximately 400 employees.\n\u201cThe coal mined at Mangoola over the next four years will offset closures and reduced output at a number of other Glencore operations, including Newlands (2023), Liddell (2023) and Clermont (2026),\u201d the company said.\nGlencore said continued operations at Mangoola had been factored into its August 2021 announcement that it would introduce a short-term emissions reduction target of 15% by 2026 and increase its medium-term target to 50% by 2035.\nA spokesperson for Ley said the minister was carrying out her responsibilities in accordance with national environment law, and taking into account \u201call other relevant considerations\u201d. They said the approval followed a rigorous assessment process and included strict environmental protection measures.\nThe approval comes as the Morrison government remains split over whether to set a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, or to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target, before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nMore than 120 countries have set the net zero target and leading developed countries, including the US, Japan, Canada, Britain and members of the European Union, have all increased their 2030 goals significantly in the past year. International and domestic political and business leaders have urged the Morrison government to join them.\nAs debate about climate within the government continues, it has made several announcements of public funding for fossil fuel projects.\nOn Tuesday the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, confirmed that the government had granted $30m to Australian Industrial Power \u2013 owned by the billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest \u2013 for work on a gas-fired power station at Port Kembla.\nLast week Taylor announced that fossil fuel projects that promise to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions underground would qualify for carbon credits, and could bid for taxpayers\u2019 support from the $4.5bn emissions reduction fund. He also committed $250m to design carbon capture and storage hubs and support its research and commercialisation.",

Last month, the supreme court let stand a Texas law that bans abortions after about six weeks, and makes no exceptions for rape or incest. The court will separately hear a case that has the potential to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the right to abortion nationwide.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Butler said she believes the new extremist restrictions in Texas and those under consideration in several other states would be an \u201canimating issue\u201d for Democrats and women across the country, offering a sharp contrast with Republicans over rights many believed had long been settled.\n\u201cTheir goal is clear and that is to overturn Roe and take away the rights of women to make their own healthcare decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single candidate running for office must be on the record about where they stand in supporting women\u2019s rights to abortion services.\u201d\nDemocrats face a daunting election cycle in 2022, but Butler believes public opinion is on their side.\nThe threats to abortion rights underscore Emily\u2019s List\u2019s mission to elect Democratic women at every level of government, Butler said. State and local elections are as critical to that fight as defending Democratic majorities in Congress.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for everybody to play,\u201d she said.\nIn Butler, Emily\u2019s List has chosen a leader with years of experience organizing Black and Latina women, a record of promoting progressive causes and ties to the highest-ranking woman in American politics. She said she views the role as an opportunity to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps while blazing a path for her seven-year-old daughter.\n\u201cIt is a great way to contribute to the movement for justice,\u201d she said, \u201cand in this moment, probably one of the most important ways to be in this space.\u201d\nButler was raised in southern Mississippi \u2013 the state that has asked the supreme court to overturn Roe when it hears arguments in the case in December. She attended Jackson State University, a historically Black college in the state, where she was taught by professors who risked arrest in the struggle for voting rights during the civil rights movement.\nThe experience had a profound influence on her career and her politics, she said. After graduating, she joined the Service Employees International Union, where she was eventually elected to lead SEIU Local 2015, the largest home-care workers union in the country. In that role, and later as president of SEIU California, she spearheaded efforts to address pay inequity for women and successfully advocated for policies like raising the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nBefore joining Emily\u2019s List, Butler worked as a political consultant and was a senior strategist on Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign.\nAs president of Emily\u2019s List, Butler said she hopes to expand its reach beyond Washington DC. Her goal is to leverage the organization\u2019s network of candidates, donors and supporters to build a \u201cwomen\u2019s political power\u201d movement.\n\u201cI want to build a powerful, more engaged \u2026 and more diverse Emily\u2019s List community,\u201d she said.\nFor Democratic women running for office, few endorsements are as influential \u2013 or sought after \u2013 as the one offered by Emily\u2019s List. Since its founding, the group has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect Democratic women, from the vice-presidency to city councils.\nIn 2018, it helped power a Democratic takeover of the House in an election cycle that was hailed as the \u201cyear of the woman\u201d. In 2020, a record six women ran for president. All lost, but later that year Emily\u2019s List issued a first-of-its-kind endorsement for vice-president.\nAs the organization has grown, so have its critics.\nWith women running for office in greater numbers \u2013 and Democrats broadly united on abortion rights \u2013 Emily\u2019s List has increasingly found itself in the middle of the party\u2019s internecine fights. Progressives in particular have scrutinized the groups\u2019 decisions to endorse candidates in primary contests involving two or more qualified women.\nButler said Emily\u2019s List has no intention of shying away from contested primaries when there\u2019s an opportunity to win.\n\u201cI look at multiple women running as a good problem to have and a sign of success,\u201d Butler said, adding: \u201cOur goal is to get more Democratic, pro-choice women elected to office. Ultimately, that means helping our candidates win in their primaries and that leads to some tough decisions.\u201d\nEmily\u2019s List has also faced criticism that its vetting process \u2013 which requires candidates to demonstrate that they can raise money and run professional campaigns \u2013 can disadvantage women of color, who face higher hurdles to fundraising than white women. Butler said there was more work to do to lift up women of color, who represent more than 40% of the candidates Emily\u2019s List has helped elect.\nShe said Emily\u2019s List was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on its commitment to engage, recruit and support candidates of color as it mobilizes new voices\u2013 young people, immigrants and working mothers, among them.\n\u201cThe organization has done incredible work to elect some really great women \u2013 some great women of color,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that there is more that progressive organizations like Emily\u2019s List can do to break down some of those structural barriers so women, and in particular Black and brown women, can move through the political process.\u201d\nAt present, Emily\u2019s List is focused on the upcoming elections in Virginia and New Jersey, and the 2022 midterms that will determine control of Congress and statehouses across the country.\nAs for whether 2024 will be the year an American woman finally shatters that \u201chighest and hardest glass ceiling\u201d, Butler said it was far too early to speculate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the mission of Emily\u2019s List to elect Democratic pro-choice women at all levels of government,\u201d she said. \u201cThe presidency should not be the only level of government that remains out of reach.\u201d",

        "content": "Premier Daniel Andrews is confident of meeting 26 October reopening date as epidemiologists say numbers are consistent with modelling\nVictoria is on track to stabilise its Covid case numbers and reopen later this month, despite reporting a national record of 1,763 infections on Tuesday.\nThe premier, Daniel Andrews, said the government was still committed to \u201cdoing everything that we can to deliver the roadmap\u201d, even though Covid case numbers had been above 1,000 for six days running.\nHe said he was confident the state would still meet its reopening date of 26 October \u2013 the day Victoria was expected to achieve a 70% double-dose vaccination rate.\nMore freedoms were then expected when Victoria hits an 80% vaccination rate. This was due on 5 November.\n\u201cI have no advice on altering anything on the roadmap,\u201d Andrews said.\n\u201cI want to try to give people as much freedom as fast as I can, as safely as possible.\u201d\nThe Burnet Institute modelling, which helped to inform Victoria\u2019s roadmap out of lockdown, suggested Victoria\u2019s peak would not come until some time between 19 and 31 October, when daily new diagnoses were projected to reach 1,400 to 2,900 cases.\nThe chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, Prof Catherine Bennett, said that the state had exceeded 1,700 cases about two weeks earlier than the model projected, but this was not yet cause for concern.\nBased on current rolling averages, she thought the state would hit between 2,000 and 2,200 cases in late October, but that would be \u201cstill within the range of the model\u201d.\n\u201cThe good news is our hospital rates are actually lower than the model is predicting,\u201d Bennett said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe Burnet model suggested that at 1,400 to 2,900 cases, there would be between 1,200 and 2,500 people in hospital and between 260 and 550 of those would be in intensive care.\nOn Tuesday there were 517 people in hospital with Covid-19 in Victoria, 101 of those in intensive care.\n\u201cIt is still early days for hospitals, and we might still see a hospital peak in a week or so, as current cases start to develop more serious illness,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThere is a risk hospital rates still need to catch up to the model. But as long as we don\u2019t exceed the model, I am hopeful authorities can manage it.\u201d\nBennett said the reproductive, or reff, rate was key to continuing with plans to reopen the state.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe reff rate for the virus on Tuesday was 1.2, which means for every 10 people who test positive, a further 12 people could be expected to become infected in the next generation of spread. On Saturday, the reff was higher, at 1.6, following high case numbers throughout the end of last week.\n\u201cWhen we look at numbers, we look at rolling averages rather than a single day, and the good news is that our reproductive number is coming down closer to one again,\u201d Bennett said.\nOnce the reff falls below one, the spread can be contained and the infection will eventually die out. Bennett said if the reff could stay low, this would be more important than overall case numbers. New South Wales, for example, had consistently managed to hold its reff between 1.2 and 1.4.\n\u201cVictoria had lower case numbers over the weekend, and today\u2019s high number is probably catch-up for those who put off testing over the weekend,\u201d Bennett said.\n\u201cNow, clearly, there is something in the background like protests or grand final day parties that has pushed the number up, but I\u2019m hopeful that because it\u2019s against an even higher background rate of vaccination, we can recover and get back to a plateauing of cases, or at least a much slower rise, in the next week or so. It will be concerning, however, if we continue to see big rises over the next few days.\u201d\nWith cases rising, the state will from this week stop publicly listing tier two exposure sites, because there are so many of them that contact tracers cannot keep up. Instead they will focus on listing the most high-risk exposure sites, known as tier one sites.\nProf Margaret Hellard, the Burnet Institute deputy director who oversaw the modelling, said the work suggested dozens of scenarios, including those that were still within the range of Victoria\u2019s Tuesday case numbers.\n\u201cWe constantly are recalibrating the model based on updated data, but we don\u2019t do it every day, we wait for a few weeks of data because that average is more reliable, and then we recalibrate to see where we\u2019re on track,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a wide range as to where we might be in Victoria on a particular date, and that\u2019s why I always say people have got to be incredibly careful not to see modelling as forecasting.\u201d",

        "content": "Decarbonisation plan, with almost 40% of power sourced from fossil fuels, is a monumental challenge\nAs Boris Johnson confirmed plans to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035, the UK was sourcing almost 40% of its power from fossil fuels, underscoring the scale of the challenge ahead.\nThe government\u2019s target, announced on Monday with less than a month until the start of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, is a key component of its pledge to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.\nThat broader effort will probably involve much more widespread use of electric vehicles, and electric heat pumps in the home, meaning the UK must generate much more power but with far lower emissions. The challenges involved are monumental.\nDemand was just under 35 gigawatts (GW) on Monday but that can rise to about 58GW at peak, on cold winter days. Expressed over the course of a year, the UK used about 330 terawatt hours last year, 5% down on 2019, when the coronavirus pandemic dampened demand. By 2035, demand is projected to reach 460 terawatt hours, an increase of almost 40%.\nLast year, wind and solar produced a record proportion of UK electricity, at 43%, eclipsing fossil fuels, at 40%, for the first time. The rest was largely supplied by nuclear power and imports through subsea interconnector cables. Easter Monday this year was the UK grid\u2019s greenest day ever, with low carbon sources hitting almost 80%, thanks to sunny spells, blustery winds and low holiday demand.\nBut when conditions are not ideal, it is invariably gas that picks up the slack. Gas emits significantly less carbon than coal, which has been almost eliminated from the UK power mix and should be gone altogether by 2024, but meeting climate pledges means massively reducing gas usage.\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent body launched in 2008, estimates that the carbon intensity of electricity generation needs to fall significantly on the road to net zero. The amount of CO2 emitted per kilowatt hour would have to fall from 220g in 2019 to 10g in 2035.\nAfter crunching the numbers, the energy advisory firm Cornwall Insight believes this requires a massive ramp-up of wind and solar to meet up to 86% of electricity demand inside 15 years.\nThis would require offshore wind capacity more than quadrupling from 10GW to 44GW, while onshore wind rises by 14GW to between 30GW and 44GW. Solar would need to increase significantly, too, from 15GW to between 22GW and 30GW.\nNot even close. Renewables need reliable backup because of their volatility. Cornwall Insight\u2019s projection adds in 15GW of capacity supplied by interconnectors, 5GW of nuclear power and a further 16GW of gas or biomass plants that use carbon capture and storage technology to reduce CO2 emissions drastically.\nThe CCC\u2019s projections include gas plants being converted to run on hydrogen and meeting about 5% of demand.\nStorage is absolutely key, to ensure surplus renewable energy can be saved up on sunny, windy days for release when conditions are less favourable. The CCC\u2019s plan, the \u201cbalanced pathway\u201d to net zero, envisages a wind and solar-dominated grid backed up by 18GW of battery storage capacity by 2035. Battery capacity is at just 1.3GW now, although 20GW of projects are in the works.\nHydrogen storage is another option, using electrolysis to extract \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d from water, which can be kept for long periods of time and then burnt to regenerate the electricity or used to replace fossil fuels in applications such as transport.\nThis is not to be confused with pumped hydro storage using water, which involves pumping water uphill and then using the downhill flow to generate electricity.\nOne hope is that electric vehicles can be used as batteries to store electricity and release it as needed, when the cars are not in use. But local and national power grids need to be smarter to make that work, while a surge in the number of EVs also creates extra overall power demand.\nCornwall Insight estimates that investment of up to \u00a3200bn will be required to bring online the wind, solar and battery power needed for a renewable-powered UK. The CCC says investment must reach \u00a350bn a year by 2030.\nNot quite. The conventional wisdom is that some level of gas capacity needs to remain on the system, even if it barely contributes more than a few hours of supply here and there. The idea is that it stands ready to provide quick bursts of power when required, at short notice.\nNuclear power plants cost a lot, take years to build and have many vehement opponents, who say they simply do not count as green energy. However, they are capable of generating a large amount of electricity without carbon emissions.\nThe big problem is that most nuclear reactors are scheduled for retirement soon. The current fleet offers capacity of about 8.9GW, satisfying about a sixth of UK demand. But more than half of that is due to come offline by the end of 2024 alone, starting with Hunterston B later this year. Assuming there are no further delays, the new Hinkley Point C reactors do not fire up until 2026 and 2027.\nThe picture has been complicated by reports that the UK government is looking to eject China from nuclear projects. Nuclear enthusiasts hope the 2035 target signals strong backing for EDF\u2019s Sizewell C, in Suffolk, as well as Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey, which has struggled to get going amid investors\u2019 funding concerns. Throw in plans by Rolls-Royce for small modular reactors, colloquially known as mini nukes, and capacity could reach 15GW by 2035.\nThe gamechanger for nuclear could be something called regulated asset base financing, which the government is exploring. That should offer guaranteed returns for investors, attracting much-needed additional backing.\nFrom a technical perspective, yes, but there are significant policy hurdles to overcome. Energy industry lobbyists point to slow planning consent, infrequent windfarm auctions and insufficient grid infrastructure. Many experts believe the energy market needs to be totally redesigned to adapt to changing needs, potentially overseen by a new body.\nHelping consumers reduce demand is also important. Energy suppliers have a role to play there but are under increasing pressure because of the surge in gas prices that has resulted in 12 failing this year, with more expected to follow.",

Full stop,\u201d said Langensiepen, a German Green elected to the parliament in 2019.\nAlthough there is no universally accepted definition of \"precarious work\", the term is used to describe workers who have temporary employment that does not offer the security and protection of employed work.\nFor example, it may involve zero-hours contracts or unpredictable/variable work or hours, non-standard or atypical employment contracts, designation of bogus \"self-employed\" status, below-average pay, an elevated threat of losing work at short notice, along with minimum or no holiday, parental and sick pay.\u00a0\u00a0\nIndividuals in precarious work may be at a high risk of in-work poverty and economic vulnerability. They may be excluded from social rights such as pensions, decent housing and healthcare.\u00a0\nIn 2016, it was estimated that more than 7 million Britons were in precarious employment. An EU report recognises precariousness as a problematic practice.\nAsked whether the EU should ban subcontracting, she said: \u201cWe need EU-level social standards. We, as Greens, are crystal clear: we need minimum wage, minimum income.\u201d\nThe Guardian investigation revealed how meat companies may avoid legal liability for pay, working time, accidents and injuries by hiring workers through a variety of intermediaries, including subcontractors, agents and agencies.\n  Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zdechovsk\u00fd, a centre-right Czech MEP and another vice-chair of the employment committee, said he would not go as far as banning subcontracting, but said companies must guarantee all workers were subject to the same rules.\n\u201cWhile we must give companies the option to use subcontracted workers to answer specific needs arising in specific times, such as during the pandemic, the EU must also guarantee that subcontractors follow the same set of rules applicable to the rest of workers in the companies that use their services,\u201d he said.\nThe problems in the meat industry were also evident in other labour-intensive industries, such as construction and food delivery, said Claes-Mikael St\u00e5hl, deputy secretary general of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). \u201cThere is a long chain of subcontracting, which \u2026 are structures for enabling low-wage competition to take in migrants at low cost and in precarious conditions,\u201d he said of such industries.\nInes Wagner, a professor at the Norwegian Institute for Social Research, said she had found \u201cthe same conditions and grievances\u201d aired by meat-industry workers during her research in 2015. \u201cThat\u2019s quite disconcerting,\u201d Wagner said.\nSince then, some countries have tightened up the rules. After an outbreak of coronavirus in large meat-processing plants in Germany, the government there banned subcontracting in the industry with fines of \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,000) for rule-breaking companies. However, the ban on subcontracting contained loopholes, such as exemptions for small firms and during the summer barbecue season for the first three years the law is in force.\nThe EU has also created the European Labour Authority, which is charged with upholding EU law on working standards and the movement of labour. Jean-Claude Juncker, who proposed it as the the-then European Commission president, said in 2017: \u201cIn a union of equals, there can be no second-class workers. Workers should earn the same pay for the same work in the same place.\u201d\nThe ELA began work in 2019, but will not be fully operational until 2024.\nIn 2018, the EU agreed to overhaul the rules on \u201cposted workers\u201d \u2013 EU nationals sent by their employer to work in another member state. Posted workers pay national insurance contributions to their home country, rather than to the country where they work. This allows posted workers from central and eastern Europe countries to offer cheaper services in western Europe, where labour costs are higher.\nPosted workers number only about 2 million people \u2013 under 1% of the labour force, compared with 17 million \u201cmobile workers\u201d, or EU nationals who use their right to live or work in other member states.\nThe changes were a victory for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who was elected on a promise of a \u201cEurope that protects\u201d and wants to reduce differences in pay and conditions. Under the new rules, posted workers can only work for lower salaries for one year, after which they must be paid the same as the domestic workforce.\nBut St\u00e5hl, the trade unionist, sees problems with EU rules on posted workers. He recalls a case in his native Sweden, where one Polish company won 59 contracts to refurbish houses over 11 years while continually claiming they were hiring \u201ctemporary\u201d posted workers. \u201cThat\u2019s just one example of how companies use the internal market to compete on low wages,\u201d he said.\nIn emailed comments to the Guardian, the EU commissioner for jobs and social rights, Nicolas Schmit, said: \u201cI find reports of poor working conditions, non-transparent terms or inhumane treatment of workers completely intolerable.\n\u201cSome countries have already taken action and clamped down on poor working conditions in slaughterhouses, but more progress is needed. I urge all member states to redouble their efforts to ensure that EU labour laws are properly enforced by all companies and in all sectors, as well as to follow up with inspections as needed.\u201d\nTrade unions fear that national governments are struggling to uphold and enforce labour standards, after wide-ranging cuts since the financial crisis. \n  Research by the ETUC found that workplace safety inspections in the EU had fallen by a fifth since 2010, while there had also been a loss of 1,000 safety inspectors \u2013 7% of the total. The cuts were deepest in Portugal and Malta, which each saw a 55% reduction in inspections. Even the bloc\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, saw a 25% fall in inspections during this period.\nThe ETUC has yet to be convinced by the fledgling European Labour Authority, accusing it of failing to take action over dozens of cases of labour exploitation last year, including unpaid and underpaid wages of EU and non-EU migrant workers.\nAttitudes to labour market regulation were undergoing a generational change, St\u00e5hl said. \u201cFor almost 20 years the EU has been used as a structure to enable wage competition and that [view] has just shifted.\u201d Recent legal changes showed the predominant view now was \u201cthat the EU should be used as an instrument to prevent wage competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an important shift but, of course, we are not there yet.\u201d\nWagner said current labour market structures were reinforced by social factors \u2013 workers in relatively poorer eastern European and non-EU countries seeking higher wages, as well as employment contracts that create dependency, such as travel to the destination country, accommodation and transport to the workplace often being paid for workers in farming and food processing.\n  \u201cAs long as this dependent relationship is within reasonable acceptable grounds for the workers, then it might continue,\u201d she said. Workers will only get out of exploitative jobs, \u201cwhen there is no [more] work, or there is no salary paid at all\u201d.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

So what is a federal integrity commission and do we need such a body?\nA Commonwealth Integrity Commission, or CIC, would be an independent body that could scrutinise politicians\u2019 actions.\nThe CIC is both narrower in scope \u2013 because it excludes anyone outside the public sector who dishonestly or improperly influences decision-making \u2013 and sets a higher bar for corruption because alleged public-sector misconduct can only be investigated if it would constitute a criminal offence.\nThe CIC would not hold public hearings into parliamentarians or the public sector, and would not make findings of corrupt conduct, only refer matters to police or prosecutors if it believes a crime has been committed.\nAlthough Labor, the Greens and crossbench senators including Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff have been highly critical of the CIC model, the government has made a virtue of its differences from the NSW Icac model.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the CIC would have \u201cprocesses that assume people are innocent before thought to be guilty\u201d, incorrectly implying that the NSW Icac does not grant the presumption of innocence.\nThe assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, has claimed Icac proceedings have \u201cseen lives destroyed over trivialities, careers ended over investigations that have gone nowhere, and the tarnishing of the reputations of people who appear as witnesses, not as suspects, only to find themselves painted guilty in the public eye by their mere appearance\u201d.\nStoker said the government wants the bill in parliament before the end of the year.

As services are being restored, questions are being asked about what caused the outage, and why it took so long to fix.\nJust before 5pm UTC, people began noticing they could not access Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger. It would be more than five hours before services would begin to be restored.\nFacebook issued a statement on Tuesday confirming that the cause of the outage was a configuration change to the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between the company\u2019s data centres, which had a cascading effect, bringing all Facebook services to a halt.\nIt meant not only was Facebook gone, but everything Facebook runs disappeared too.\nOthers have provided a bit more detail on why Facebook vanished from the internet.\nCloudflare \u2013 which had its own recent internet outage issues \u2013 has provided a detailed explanation about what happened.\nIt involves two things that sort out how the internet is the internet \u2013 that is Domain Name System (DNS) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).\nThe internet is a lot of connected networks. A lot. So that means to keep order of things, you need something like BGP to tell you where you need to go. DNS is essentially the address system for the location of each website \u2013 its IP address \u2013 while BGP is the roadmap that finds the most efficient way to get to that IP address.\nFacebook (accidentally, we assume) sent an update to a deep-level routing protocol on the internet that said, basically, \"hey we don't have any servers any more xoxo\"\nCloudflare said Facebook on Monday essentially told BGP through a series of updates that those paths to Facebook no longer existed. But not just for Facebook, everything Facebook runs. That meant people trying to reach Facebook couldn\u2019t find the path to access it.\nAll of Facebook\u2019s services were affected, not just Facebook. It included Facebook\u2019s own internal systems, with reports staff were locked out of offices, and could not access their own internal communications platform.\nTo the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we're sorry. We\u2019ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us.\nFacebook\u2019s own internal systems are run from the same place so it was hard for employees to diagnose and resolve the problem.\nAs the Guardian\u2019s UK technology editor, Alex Hern, put it on Twitter, \u201cFacebook runs EVERYTHING through Facebook\u201d, so the usual way you would fix a problem like this was also not working.\nFacebook staff were reportedly unable to access their own communications platform, Workplace, and were unable to access their office due to the security pass system being caught up in the outage.\nFacebook indicated the duration and severity of the outage meant the systems were being brought back to full capacity slowly.\nFacebook so far has not gone into much detail about what went wrong and how it was fixed, but there were multiple reports the social media giant sent a technical team out to its servers in California to manually reset the servers where the problem originated.\nThis one is fairly uncommon but not something that can be completely avoided. However, the Facebook outage, along with others including the Cloudflare outage in 2020, and the Fastly one in June, show the problems with having a single point of failure for a vast number of online services people rely on.\nPeople rely on Facebook not only to connect with friends and family, but businesses use it to log into other services including online sales websites. In some countries, it is the dominant means of communication through services like WhatsApp. That an outage can have such a profound impact on billions of people for several hours will give some pause for thought.\nNo more than when Facebook is up and running.\nYes. Facebook is not having a good time right now. Last week Facebook paused a plan to launch Instagram for kids, after leaked internal research showed the company was aware the app could affect girls\u2019 mental health.\nThen on Sunday, the former Facebook civic integrity product manager Frances Haugen went public with explosive allegations that Facebook had prioritised growth and profit over public safety.\n\u201cThe version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world,\u201d she told 60 Minutes.\nWe haven\u2019t seen a cost estimate yet for how much it cost businesses who rely on Facebook. The outage, along with the whistleblower story on Sunday, prompted Facebook\u2019s share price to drop 4.9% on Monday, causing founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal wealth to drop $6bn, according to Bloomberg.",

Worton was not arrested despite the assault, he said.\nWest Midlands police have admitted missing several opportunities to protect Van Hagen before she died.\nHer father said: \u201cWe should never have been put through what we were put through. You trust these people and they don\u2019t do their job properly.\u201d\nThe police\u2019s handling of violence against women and girls is under new scrutiny after the murder of Sarah Everard by the Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens.\nMr Van Hagen backed calls for a public inquiry into claims of institutional misogyny in UK policing, saying his daughter\u2019s case was \u201cjust not taken seriously\u201d by West Midlands police.\nA neighbour, who was asked by police to keep a log of suspected abusive incidents at Van Hagen\u2019s flat, made a note of 27 occasions before she was found dead with bruising around her neck.\nThe force initially told Van Hagen\u2019s family that she had been murdered by Worton who had then killed himself.\nBut detectives later changed their view and issued a statement saying she died from a suspected drug overdose, after alcohol and stimulant BZP were found in her system.\nOfficers said that bruising around her neck was the result of a sex game and ruled the cause of death was an accidental drug overdose.\nBut a police review in 2017 found that the senior investigating officer in the case failed to make proper enquiries about marks to Van Hagen\u2019s neck. The force later admitted that its initial assumption about drugs had led to an \u201cinaccurate narrative\u201d about her death.\nIn a statement last month, the West Midlands chief constable Dave Thompson apologised for the \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in the force\u2019s handling of the case, before and after Suzanne\u2019s death.\nHe said: \u201cWe deeply regret a number of missed opportunities to investigate Suzanne\u2019s circumstances more widely and to engage with her.\n\u201cWe could and should have done more to protect Suzanne and her daughter from the abuse they were suffering. To compound the family\u2019s pain, they were let down by a failure to properly investigate Suzanne\u2019s death.\u201d\nMr Van Hagen said on Monday that the family had still not received a written apology from the police, despite the force publishing a video apology last month.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just lip service,\u201d he said. \u201cThey found out they had made big, big, big mistakes in Suzanne\u2019s case about three and a half years ago. It\u2019s taken another three years to get this apology.\u201d\nOn one occasion, a police family liaison officer told Van Hagen\u2019s younger sister: \u201cYour sister had two legs and she should have used them.\u201d\nWayne Jones, the detective who led the failed investigation into Van Hagen\u2019s death, was sacked two years later for sexually harassing four female colleagues.\nThe Van Hagens\u2019 family lawyers, Deighton Pierce Glynn, said the case highlighted the \u201cinstitutional discrimination against women by the police\u201d.\nMr Van Hagen said: \u201cThe guy had a criminal record as long as your arm, he was not allowed to see his children because of domestic violence and yet he was allowed to have access to our granddaughter. The police knew, the social services knew, the mental health people knew this \u2013 but they just didn\u2019t do anything about it. And then to cap it all, when Suzanne died they didn\u2019t bother to investigate her death.\u201d\nAfter complaints by the family, a West Midlands police professional standards report found: \u201cThe police response to the domestic violence suffered by Suzanne Van Hagen was very poor, inadequate, lacked positive action and was not as the force and the public could have reasonably expected. West Midlands police did not take this domestic violence seriously.\u201d\n This article was amended on 5 October 2021 to change the main image.",

        "content": "Changing from the two-legged knockout format offers teams more money, exposure and a genuine chance to improve \nWhen Uefa announced that the Women\u2019s Champions League would be reformatted to include a group stage there was widespread support. In many ways it was very overdue. Now, on the eve of the first group games, there is momentum behind the competition like never before.\nWho will lift the trophy in Turin come 22 May is less clear than ever. Barcelona\u2019s emphatic 4-0 defeat of Chelsea in last season\u2019s final in Gothenburg ended Lyon\u2019s five-year stranglehold on Europe\u2019s premier prize and the door is wide open and the competition tighter.\nYou may ask why a group stage is viewed as the vehicle for the growth of the competition at a time when many are agitating for the removal of the group stage from the men\u2019s competition? It is a valid question. There are huge disparities between women\u2019s football teams in Europe and the previous knockout format did little to advance the development of the game in the weakest countries. There are gaps between the quality of teams in the men\u2019s competition but they are not as stark.\nIn the women\u2019s competition, teams from amateur clubs and leagues struggled against the professional or semi-professional clubs across two legs and their Champions League journey ended with a whimper. The optics weren\u2019t great and they gained little from a financial or sporting point of view. The introduction of a group stage starts the process of redressing the balance.\nAll teams in the new group stage will earn \u20ac400,000 for playing six games. Crucially, that means even the weakest of teams taking part get vital revenue, exposure and a series of six matches of varying difficulty that they can use to test their players. In addition, each team represented earns a slice of a new solidarity payment pot which goes to other clubs in their domestic league to raise the level back home.\nThe opening round of fixtures will see Hoffenheim play Danish side HB K\u00f8ge and seven-time champions Lyon begin their bid to reclaim their crown against Sweden\u2019s BK H\u00e4cken. But it is one of the two games being played just over two hours later that will set the tone for the tournament on Tuesday night.\nBarcelona welcome 2007 winners Arsenal to the Johan Cruyff Stadium having scored 35 goals and conceded only once in their first five Superliga games. Arsenal, meanwhile, have scored 16 and conceded twice in four wins that have included victories overs Women\u2019s Super League title rivals Manchester City and Chelsea. Both are in scintillating form, although Barcelona are further into their current team cycle than Arsenal and are playing with a fluidity that speaks to an understanding between many of the players that has been developed over a number of years.\nIn Alexia Putellas they have perhaps the only player in the world that could justifiably beat the Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema to every individual prize available this year. A four-minute hat-trick in Barcelona\u2019s 8-0 defeat of Valencia went viral to lift Putellas\u2019 name into broader circles and stopping the marauding Bar\u00e7a attack with Putellas at the heart will be extremely tough for Arsenal. If the Gunners triumph in Catalonia it will send shockwaves through a competition that would then realistically be anyone\u2019s to win.\nThe other standout tie of the round sees another English team in action with Chelsea playing old foes Wolfsburg at Kingsmeadow on Wednesday night. Last season Emma Hayes\u2019s team exorcised the ghost of having not beaten the German side in six attempts, doing the double over them in the quarter-finals before losing in the final. Wolfsburg have slipped off their perch, having been pipped to the Bundesliga title by Bayern Munich last season and they currently sit second, two points behind the champions, but the two-time Champions League winners understand what it takes to go far in Europe. Chelsea have stuttered domestically as well with an opening day 3-2 defeat to Arsenal tarnishing an otherwise unblemished start to the season.\nWhat has changed?For the 2021-22 season the Women\u2019s Champions League includes a group stage, made up of 16 teams. Uefa have abolished the away goal rule which means that once the knockout stage begins extra time and penalties will decide ties. VAR will also be used from the knockout phase, having previously only been used for the final.\nPrize moneyA new financial distribution model means that clubs taking part this season will receive a slice of \u20ac24m. Each of the 16 teams competing in the new group stage will receive \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3341,000), compared to the \u20ac80,000 clubs picked up at the same stage, played over two legs, last season. This year\u2019s winners could earn up to \u20ac1.4m, depending on results in the group stage. Last year\u2019s winners Barcelona collected \u20ac460,000 in total. Meanwhile, new solidarity payments will filter down to teams in the leagues of teams participating in the competition.\nWhere to watch?A new centralised broadcast rights deal for the group stage onwards was signed with sports streaming platform DAZN earlier this year. As a result fans around the world (excluding the Middle East, North Africa and China) will be able to watch all 61 games on DAZN\u2019s YouTube channel for free for the first two years of the four-year deal. For the 2023-25 seasons all 61 games will be shown by DAZN, with 19 games available for free on\u00a0YouTube. Suzanne Wrack\nThese marquee fixtures will attract a huge audience to the competition thanks to the new group stage format and to a new broadcast rights deal that will see all 61 fixtures from the group stage onwards broadcast for free for two years by the streaming service Dazn via YouTube.\nIt is hard to overstate the significance of the deal reached between Dazn, YouTube and Uefa that commits to showcasing all of the games to as big an audience as possible. A report by Dazn and the Female Quotient titled \u201cThe coverage gap\u201d showed the potential impact that opening the game up like this could have with \u201cminimal promotion for events, broadcast disparities, and lack of steady media and social coverage and storytelling\u201d highlighted as creating \u201ca significant barrier to viewership\u201d, and 64% of those surveyed saying they didn\u2019t watch women\u2019s sport because they didn\u2019t know enough about the athletes and weren\u2019t aware of where they could watch games.\nIn recent years Uefa has split the women\u2019s Champions League final away from the city where the men\u2019s is hosted, with this year\u2019s match to take place at Allianz Stadium \u2013 the home of Juventus. It has also centralised broadcast rights and sold them separately and has split sponsorship away from the men\u2019s deals.\nNow the format has changed to maximise the impact of the tournament on women\u2019s football in Europe at the bottom as much as the top. Everything is aligning. Let\u2019s hope the football thrives in the environment that is being built for it.",

This will stop protesters from targeting power stations, media organisations or airports, she will say.\nThe Tories are proposing to make the change through the police, crime, courts and sentencing bill, which will grant the police additional powers. They hope it will become law by May.\nIndividuals who breach the travel bans will be in contempt of court, which carries a maximum sentence of two years or an unlimited fine, Tory sources added.\nThey will be criminal rather than civil orders, giving the police the ability to arrest offenders immediately rather than relying on National Highways to issue individuals with legal papers, a process that can take weeks.\nThe home secretary will say she will amend new legislation to bring in other powers to seize equipment that protesters could use to lock or glue themselves on to fixed objects.\nIn recent weeks, the home secretary has applied for court injunctions to stop Insulate Britain campaigners from bringing motorways to a standstill. The current fines for blocking a highway are up to \u00a31,000.\nOn Monday, the climate activist group said 54 supporters had blocked Hanger Lane in north-west London, the Blackwall tunnel in south-east London and Wandsworth Bridge in south-west London, as they began a fourth week of their campaign for government action on home insulation.\nPatel will say: \u201cToday I can announce I will increase the maximum penalties for disrupting a motorway; criminalise interference with key infrastructures such as roads, railways and our free press; and give the police and courts new powers to deal with the small minority of offenders intent on travelling around the country, causing disruption and misery across our communities.\u201d\nIn a further announcement, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, will say that 12,000 former offenders will be fitted with \u201csobriety tags\u201d, which can check if they are breaching court-ordered drinking bans.\nIn the first planned widespread use of alcohol monitors on prison leavers, the deputy prime minister will say they will be used over the next four years on those known to have committed a crime while under the influence.\nThe plan is part of a series of measures to bolster the criminal justice system, which will be outlined at party conference by Raab and Patel.\nUntil now, alcohol monitoring tags have been ordered for more than 1,500 offenders serving community sentences since they were introduced in October last year.\nRaab will say that almost 26,000 extra offenders will be tagged over the next three years under a \u00a3180m plan to expand the use of electronic monitoring to cut crime.\nRaab will also announce that 10,000 of those will be thieves and burglars fitted with GPS tags as they come out of prison.\nA National Audit Office report in 2017 concluded there was little evidence of any demand for GPS tagging, or that it was effective, or that it offered value for money.\nMinistry of Justice insiders insist that the technology has since improved and that there is further evidence that it can be used to curb reoffending.\nRaab will say:\u201cThis major increase in hi-tech GPS tagging will see us leading the world in using technology to fight crime and keep victims safe. From tackling alcohol-fuelled violence and burglary to protecting domestic abuse victims, we are developing tags to make our streets and communities safer.\u201d",

The Global Citizens\u2019 Assembly for Cop26 is a practical way of showing how we can accelerate action through solidarity and people power. People everywhere want bold, ambitious climate action, and now is the moment for national leaders to stand and deliver.\u201d\nCitizens\u2019 assemblies have been used in some countries to help decide difficult issues of national importance. For instance, they played a key role in Ireland\u2019s decision to change its abortion laws in a referendum.\nIn the past two years, citizens\u2019 assemblies in countries including the UK and France have taken on the climate crisis and shown large public support for the key measures needed to tackle global heating, including investing in new forms of energy and infrastructure, and changing lifestyles and behaviour.\nThe members of the assembly will be chosen through a lottery and a selection process that will ensure the makeup of the body reflects global demographics: 60 of the 100 people will come from Asia, 17 from Africa, half will be women and 70 will be people who earn $10 a day or less. They will receive a stipend, technical and communications support and translation services to ensure they can take part.\nA team of international scientists and other experts will explain details of the climate crisis and potential solutions, and members of the assembly will discuss how these might work in practice, seeking to answer the question: \u201cHow can humanity address the climate and ecological crisis in a fair and effective way?\u201d. The key messages from their discussions will be presented at Cop26 and a report will be published in March.\nAlok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who will act as president of the Cop26 summit, said: \u201cThe Global Assembly is a fantastic initiative and was selected for representation in the green zone [of the Cop26 presentation hall] because we recognise just how important its work is and also because we are committed to bringing the voice of global citizens into the heart of Cop26. It creates that vital link between local conversation and a global conference.\u201d\nAt Cop26, countries are expected to produce plans for drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 years in order to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two goals set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",

However, it had no immediate plans to raise its prices, it added.\nThe Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, told Reuters: \u201cThe sausage roll is safe, that\u2019s one thing we haven\u2019t gone short of.\u201d\nThe bakery chain said it had been affected by the nationwide shortage of HGV drivers. An acute shortage of truck and tanker drivers has led to a petrol supply crisis and many supermarket shelves remain empty.\nBoris Johnson said on Tuesday that only 127 foreign lorry drivers had so far applied for temporary work visas. The government is offering 300 visas to overseas fuel drivers immediately, allowing them to work in the UK until the end of March. Overall, the government is offering 5,000 temporary visas to truck drivers as it tries to ease the shortage.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at the business recovery firm Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cLike many businesses, Greggs now faces the harsh bite of the supply chain crises. However, the baker may have been more prepared than most competitors as it stockpiled ingredients and equipment from 2019; its early actions may have seemed extreme at the time but will now help it shake off some supply chain challenges others are facing.\u201d\nGreggs\u2019s sales growth was particularly strong in August when many people holidayed in the UK rather than heading abroad, and remained positive in September, with a like-for-like increase of 3% in the four weeks to 2 October. As a result, Greggs expects to exceed profit forecasts for this year.\nIt has also set a target of doubling turnover over the next five years to \u00a32.4bn in 2026 and aims to have 3,000 shops, compared with 2,146 at present. It expects about 100 openings this year, which will rise to 150 every year from 2022. With roughly 10 staff per shop, this means it will be hiring about 1,500 people next year.\nGreggs has expanded home delivery, available at 943 shops, and is extending opening hours to 8pm at many outlets, where it lags rivals.\nIt said vegan ranges had been popular, such as the sausage breakfast roll, and its autumn menu featured pumpkin spiced latte as well as spooky bats and buns for Halloween.\nGreggs has opened three drive-through shops and its first outlet in Canary Wharf, London\u2019s financial district.",

        "content": "Federal treasurer warned in 2020 about the revenues of hundreds of big businesses claiming wage subsidy\nLabor has attacked Josh Frydenberg over the handling of jobkeeper, after it emerged the federal treasurer was warned last year that 950 businesses on the scheme had made revenues during the pandemic that were \u201csignificantly\u201d different from their projections.\nThe Australian Tax Office also warned Frydenberg in July 2020 that big businesses and tax agents were \u201camending\u201d prior sales records to potentially help them qualify for wage subsidies during the pandemic. It wasn\u2019t until October that the eligibility criteria was tightened.\nThe revelation is contained in a ministerial submission from the ATO\u2019s deputy commissioner, James O\u2019Halloran. It was produced under freedom of information and first reported in the Australian Financial Review.\nA further September 2020 submission shows small businesses mistakenly thought actual declines were needed to qualify, a finding which suggests some may have not claimed the payment despite being eligible.\nThe shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, on Tuesday seized on the report as further evidence of \u201cincompetent implementation\u201d, as the treasurer \u201cwas warned that big multinational corporations were behaving in suspicious ways\u201d in claiming jobkeeper.\nThe $90bn jobkeeper subsidy has come under increasing scrutiny, particularly over the government\u2019s failure to legislate a clawback mechanism to recoup wage subsidies from companies that went on to increase revenues.\nLabor and the Senate crossbench are seeking greater transparency around companies with annual turnover of more than $10m and received jobkeeper, after a string of eligible companies were shamed into paying subsidies back after increasing sales.\nThe ATO submission reveals it was monitoring alleged \u201cturnover manipulation\u201d to qualify for the scheme, which was later revamped to require businesses to suffer an actual decline in turnover to receive funding.\nIn the first phase, jobkeeper applicants could qualify based on a projected 30% reduction in revenue compared to the same month, or quarter, a year earlier, with 50% downturns required for big businesses and \u201csignificant global entities\u201d.\nThe ATO wrote that in early compliance work it found \u201ca number of jobkeeper applicants have shown a fall in sales in the application month, but with subsequent months showing substantial increases\u201d.\nThe tax office identified 40 tax agents \u201cwho appear to have engaged in concerning behaviour\u201d including adjusting revenues in comparison periods or reporting a decline in turnover in the month of the claim before a \u201csharp recovery in a subsequent period\u201d.\nIt said 948 businesses had \u201cactual turnover \u2026 significantly divergent from the projected decline\u201d.\nAfter contacting significant global entities attempting to claim the payment based on a 30% turnover decline, some \u201cvolunteered to repay\u201d the money, while others qualified \u201cnotwithstanding their mistake\u201d because they demonstrated they had suffered a 50% decline.\nIn its September 2020 submission, the ATO found \u201cmany entities were severely impacted by Covid -19 in the early months, but have rebounded quickly in the later months\u201d.\n\u201cWe have also identified many instances where entities made reasonable projections but actual decline did not eventuate.\u201d\nIt also found a \u201cstrong indication that small businesses believe they need an actual decline in turnover rather than a projection\u201d.\nNeither of the memos were marked as requiring further action.\nFrydenberg has said the treasury did not recommend changes in the first six months of the program.\nHe has also defended the jobkeeper program, claiming that businesses may not have claimed wage subsidies if they could be later forced to pay them back.\n\u201cTreasury analysis has shown that 99% of the businesses that did not experience the anticipated fall in turnover were small businesses, with an average of just four employees,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cJobkeeper was a key part of the government\u2019s economic plan to save jobs and keep businesses in business during the pandemic.\u201d\nData from the independent Parliamentary Budget Office reveals that $8.4bn was paid to 195,000 businesses that increased their turnover from July to September 2020 compared with the same quarter the year before, on top of $4.6bn to entities that were better off from April to June.\nAccording to research by Ownership Matters, 34 of Australia\u2019s largest companies claimed jobkeeper wage subsidies in the second half of 2020 despite actually improving their earnings on pre-pandemic levels, pocketing a total of $284m.\nIn September, the ATO revealed it had reviewed the eligibility of 1,600 entities for jobkeeper, including 480 large businesses, and found 95% were eligible.\nThe ATO told a Senate inquiry it had stopped more than $767m being paid through eligibility checks during the scheme.\n\u201cWe have identified $470m in overpayments of which we have recovered $194m and are pursuing $89m, with $6m in dispute; and have determined not to pursue $180m,\u201d it said.\nFrydenberg on Tuesday afternoon released a statement saying he was in isolation after a staff member tested positive for Covid. The treasurer said he had received a negative result but was remaining in isolation until further notice.",

        "content": "For a while this summer, Luis Rojas was a potential Manager of the Year contender.\nJust a few months later, he\u2019s out of a job.\nRojas was let go as New York Mets manager on Monday after two losing seasons. The team declined its option on his contract for 2022, making the announcement a day after finishing third in the NL East at 77-85 in Steve Cohen\u2019s first year of ownership.\nThe move was no surprise, the first of several significant changes coming again this offseason for a club in constant turmoil.\n\u201cI want to share such heartfelt gratitude to so many in the Mets organization for not only the last two seasons as manager, but for the last 16 years in a variety of roles,\u201d Rojas said in a statement released by the team.\n\u201cWe live in a results-oriented business, and am deeply disappointed for our staff and fans that we didn\u2019t reach our goals this season,\u201d he said.\nThe Mets said Rojas has been offered the opportunity to remain in the organization in a role still to be determined. The club said decisions about the coaching staff will be made in the coming days.\n\u201cThe entire Mets organization is grateful for the dedication and devotion that Luis has exhibited over the last two seasons as manager,\u201d team president Sandy Alderson said in a statement. \u201cHe has shown a great commitment to the Mets over many years in multiple capacities. These decisions are never easy, but we feel a change is needed at this time.\u201d\nExpected to challenge for the playoffs or even a pennant with $341m newcomer Francisco Lindor at shortstop, New York led its division for 90 straight days despite a wave of injuries \u2013 and Rojas drew praise for his steady hand and communication skills.\nBut then everything fell apart over the final two months of the season.\nWith ace pitcher Jacob deGrom sidelined since the All-Star break by a sprained elbow, New York went into a nosedive once August arrived. The lineup languished even when healthy, and an overtaxed pitching staff started to crack.\nLindor missed more than five weeks in the second half with an oblique injury and didn\u2019t emerge from his season-long slump until too late. Michael Conforto, Jeff McNeil, Dominic Smith and James McCann also flopped at the plate, leaving Pete Alonso to carry the load.\nAn untimely 2-11 stretch against the Dodgers and Giants, baseball\u2019s top two teams, dropped the Mets from five games over .500 and tied for first place to 62-66 and six and a half games out on 26 August. In a middling division, they lost the lead for good on 14 August and never really recovered.\nA missed opportunity.\nRojas made a series of questionable in-game decisions down the stretch, and the collapse was complete when the Mets were eliminated from postseason contention on 25 September with more than a week remaining. They limped to the finish line of their fourth losing season in five years, and 10th in the last 13. New York has made the playoffs twice in the past 15 seasons, advancing only in 2015 on the way to a World Series appearance.\nAs losses piled up, Rojas\u2019 fate seemed sealed before the season was over. New York went 26-34 during his first year at the helm, finishing tied for last place in the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign.\n\u201cI enjoyed my time here the last two years being the manager,\u201d Rojas said last week, the writing already on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun every day just working with the guys and connecting with them and preparing. We haven\u2019t achieved what we wanted to achieve.\u201d\nRojas was swiftly elevated to skipper in January 2020 by former general manager Brodie Van Wagenen as the replacement for Carlos Beltr\u00e1n. The promotion came just days after Beltr\u00e1n was let go without managing a single game as part of fallout from the Houston Astros\u2019 2017 sign-stealing scandal.\nWith only one big league season under his belt as New York\u2019s quality control coach, Rojas became the team\u2019s fourth manager in two and a half years \u2013 and third in four months. The move was applauded by veterans and young Mets players alike, including those such as Alonso who played for Rojas in the minors.\nRojas has worked in the Mets\u2019 organization since 2007 and spent eight years as a minor league manager. He is the son of former Montreal Expos and San Francisco Giants skipper Felipe Alou, and the brother of ex-big league outfielder Moises Alou.\nRojas turned 40 on 1 September and was the second-youngest manager in the majors, 24 days older than Minnesota\u2019s Rocco Baldelli.\n\u201cIt was fun playing for him,\u201d Lindor said. \u201cI like him a lot. He brings a lot to the game. One of the biggest messages that he brought this year was to be fearless.\u201d\nNext up, Alderson and Cohen plan to search for a president of baseball operations \u2013 and that individual will likely be tasked with hiring the new manager.\nThe Mets initially intended to bring in a president of baseball operations last offseason, but were unable to interview top targets employed by other clubs, and at least one wasn\u2019t interested in coming to New York.\nSo the Mets changed course, hiring Jared Porter as general manager to lead baseball operations under Alderson. Porter was soon fired after revelations that he sent unwanted, sexually explicit text messages and images to a female reporter in 2016 while working for the Chicago Cubs.\nZack Scott was promoted to acting general manager, then placed on paid administrative leave in early September after being arrested on 31 August on a charge of driving while intoxicated. Since then, the 73-year-old Alderson has been filling the role of GM.\nScott pleaded not guilty to the DWI charge and three traffic violations. He is due back in White Plains City Court on Thursday.",

        "content": "The disgraced former president faces a range of possible charges \u2013 including conspiracy and election fraud\nDonald Trump is facing increasing legal scrutiny in the crucial battleground state of Georgia over his attempt to sway the 2020 election there, and that heat is now overlapping with investigations in Congress looking at the former president\u2019s efforts to subvert American democracy.\nA criminal investigation into Trump\u2019s 2 January call prodding Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to \u201cjust find\u201d him 11,780 votes to block Joe Biden\u2019s win in the state is making headway. The Georgia district attorney running the inquiry is now also sharing information with the House committee investigating the 6 January attack on the Capitol in Washington DC.\nMeanwhile, a justice department taskforce investigating threats to election officials nationwide has launched inquiries in Georgia, where election officers and workers received death threats or warnings of violence, including some after Trump singled out one official publicly for not backing his baseless fraud claims.\nDespite these investigations, Trump is still pushing bogus fraud claims in Georgia. Trump wrote to Raffensperger in September asking him to decertify the election results, which is impossible, and with an eye on the 2022 elections is trying to oust Raffensperger, as well as the state\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, and other top Republicans who defied his demands to block Biden\u2019s win.\nFormer justice department officials and voting rights advocates say Trump\u2019s conspiratorial attacks on Georgia\u2019s election results, and the threats to public officials, need to be investigated diligently, and prosecuted if warranted by law enforcement, to protect election integrity and public officials.\nExperts add that Trump\u2019s alarming refusal to accept the Georgia election outcome and seek revenge on Republican officials who ignored his baseless fraud charges may affect a few pivotal 2022 races. His efforts may also encourage extremism and restrictions on minority and other voting rights similar to ones the Georgia legislature enacted this year.\nVeteran DoJ officials and prosecutors say the criminal inquiry launched by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, into Trump\u2019s call to Raffensperger and other efforts Trump made to overturn the Georgia results, seems well grounded, with ample public evidence. But they said it will probably take some time before Willis decides whether to bring charges.\nWillis has said prosecutors are scrutinizing \u201cpotential violations of Georgia law prohibiting the solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and any involvement in violence or threats related to the election\u2019s administration\u201d.\nThe Georgia investigation\u2019s merits were bolstered in late September by the release of a well-documented 107-page study from the Brookings Institution detailing Trump\u2019s high-pressure drive to block Biden\u2019s win in the state. The report concluded that Trump faced \u201csubstantial risk of possible state charges predicated on multiple crimes\u201d.\nBoasting extensive documentation from the public record, the report notes that Trump\u2019s broad effort to nullify the outcome in Georgia included personal contacts with the governor, the state attorney general and the secretary of state\u2019s chief investigator.\n\u201cTrump engaged in a pattern of repeated personal communications aimed at altering the vote count and making himself the winner in Georgia,\u201d Donald Ayer, one of several authors of the Brookings report and a former deputy attorney general in the George HW Bush administration, said in an interview.\n\u201cHe did so in the absence of any even arguable evidence of voting or counting irregularities. Unless there are other presently unknown facts that would explain it, this conduct appears to satisfy the requirements of a number of Georgia criminal statutes.\u201d\nTo further the Georgia inquiry, Willis reportedly has in recent weeks turned to the House select committee looking into the 6 January attack on the Capitol to share documents and information that could assist her work.\nWillis\u2019s outreach to the congressional committee doesn\u2019t surprise some expert observers.\n\u201cHer resources to address local crime are already taxed and any investigative steps taken on Capitol Hill means her likely marathon of a case against the former president may be a little closer to the finish line,\u201d Michael J Moore, a former Georgia prosecutor and Democrat, said in an interview.\nThe district attorney\u2019s progress was underscored by Raffensperger telling the Daily Beast in August that Fulton county investigators had \u201casked us for documents, they\u2019ve talked to some of our folks, and we\u2019ll cooperate fully\u201d.\nAccording to the news outlet, at least four people in Raffensperger\u2019s office have been interviewed, including attorney Ryan Germany and the chief operating officer, Gabriel Sterling.\nOn another legal front, the FBI has begun interviews in recent weeks with several Georgia election officials about death threats and other dangerous warnings they received in the months after the election from Trump backers suggesting falsely that Georgia officials were involved in election rigging.\nFor instance, Richard Barron, who heads the Fulton county board of elections, told the Guardian he was interviewed by two FBI agents in early September and informed them about two death threats he received, including one in the summer \u201cfull of white supremacist language\u201d which warned he would be \u201cserved lead\u201d.\n\u201cI hope the FBI makes some arrests,\u201d Barron added. \u201cPeople need to be held accountable for making threats against public officials.\u201d Barron noted that threats against him and his majority Black staff rocketed after the election, when Democrats also won two Senate seats in the historically red-leaning state. Threats against Barron escalated further after Trump singled him out by name at a rally, he said.\nFormer justice department prosecutors say that the taskforce looking into these threats has to be aggressive. \u201cAbsent rigorous law enforcement, responsible citizens will shy away from seeking these types of important public jobs, especially if they feel their families will be under threat,\u201d said Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at DoJ.\nBut even with these inquiries heating up, Trump has continued to spread his false claims about the election results, as he did at a campaign-style rally in Perry, Georgia, on 25 September, where a few of his favored Georgia candidates spoke \u2013including Representative Jody Hice, who is hoping to defeat Raffensperger in a primary contest.\nTrump\u2019s drive to retaliate against Republican politicians who defied his efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s Georgia win has dismayed some veteran party operatives who see them as counterproductive.\n\u201cI think the Trump presence in Georgia has not been good for the GOP\u2019s politics the last two years,\u201d said Republican lobbyist Ed Rogers, who hails from Alabama. \u201cPolitics is about addition, and vengeance is not consistent with addition.\u201d",

On Sunday, Facebook was accused of prioritising growth and profit over the public good, after the site\u2019s former civic integrity product manager, Frances Haugen, went public.\nBut then, on Monday, it actually was the servers. An almost six-hour outage saw Facebook vanish from the internet.\nThe error was one of its own making. At around 5pm UTC that day, Facebook made a configuration change to the backbone routers, which coordinate network traffic between the company\u2019s datacentres.\nThe change had the effect of telling the Border Gateway Protocol \u2013 effectively the post office of the internet \u2013 there were no directions to find Facebook\u2019s servers when people tried to access the site or any of its other services.\n\u201cToday, the directions for how to get to Facebook\u2019s DNS server\u2019s addresses weren\u2019t available,\u201d Cloudflare\u2019s senior vice-president of engineering, Usman Muzaffar, said. \u201cWithout being able to contact the DNS servers, visitors trying to reach a Facebook property, like facebook.com, will not get an answer and so the page won\u2019t load.\u201d\n\u201cIn our experience, these usually are mistakes, not attacks.\u201d\nThrough Facebook\u2019s assimilation of the competition over the years, the error also brought down Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.\nBut it didn\u2019t stop there. The outage also brought down Facebook\u2019s internal systems, including its Workplace internal comms platform, and the security system. This meant staff couldn\u2019t use their passes to access the building. A team of engineers reportedly had to be sent out to manually reset the servers in California.\nTwitter joked \u201chello literally everyone\u201d during the outage, as even Facebook executives were forced to resort to the that platform to communicate the news.\nhello literally everyone\nSincere apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now.  We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible\nIt\u2019s easy to joke that the Facebook outage meant a bunch of boomers would have to do their vaccine research elsewhere, or peace on earth suddenly broke out, but the reality was more serious.\nFor businesses that run on Facebook or Instagram, it meant potential lost sales. For services that use Facebook as a login service, new users could not be authenticated. For parts of the world, like south-east Asia, where Facebook is the internet or WhatsApp is the dominant method of communication, the impact is much greater.\nThose, like Democrat Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are arguing for Facebook to be split back down into smaller companies, Monday\u2019s outage is a powerful argument in favour.\n\u201cIf Facebook\u2019s monopolistic behavior was checked back when it should\u2019ve been (perhaps around the time it started acquiring competitiors like Instagram), the continents of people who depend on WhatsApp and [Instagram] for either communication or commerce would be fine right now,\u201d she tweeted.\nIf Facebook\u2019s monopolistic behavior was checked back when it should\u2019ve been (perhaps around the time it started acquiring competitors like Instagram), the continents of people who depend on WhatsApp & IG for either communication or commerce would be fine right now. Break them up.\n\u201cBreak them up.\u201d\nThe internet by its very nature should be decentralised, but through the course of the past year, through three high profile outages with Cloudflare, Fastly, and now Facebook, we\u2019ve seen the achilles heal(s) exposed. Single points of failure that can inflict a lot of damage across the internet.\nIn each instance, it is telling that the immediate thoughts many have is the cause is some malicious attack, or a nation state actor launching a strike, where in each case it has been a fault, or human error.\nFor Facebook, the incident shows just how siloed the internet has become into such a small number of companies. Regulators in the United States, and across the world will be pointing to this example in making a case to break the company up, or block any future acquisitions.",

        "content": "Welcome to our monthly roundup of the biggest issues in farming and food production, with must-read reports from around the web \nWe\u2019ve been running a startling investigation into Europe\u2019s multibillion-pound meat industry, revealing how it has become a global hotspot for outsourced labour, hiring thousands of workers through subcontractors, agencies and bogus co-operatives on inferior pay and conditions.\nJournalists Ella McSweeney and Holly Young spent the past six months interviewing workers and insiders across the UK and EU. They report that thousands of workers in some countries \u2013 many of them migrants \u2013 are precariously employed, with some being paid 40% to 50% less than employees in the same factories.\n\u201cThe system is sick everywhere across Europe. It\u2019s based on cheap prices for meat, on the exploitation of labour,\u201d Enrico Somaglia, deputy secretary general of the European Federation of Food, Agriculture and Tourism Trade Unions, told them.\nThe investigation has revealed how migrant workers prop up Ireland\u2019s \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) meat industry; explored conditions for temporary staff at meat plants in the Netherlands \u2013 Europe\u2019s biggest meat exporter; and asked whether other countries would follow the lead of Denmark, which has secured decent pay and conditions within the sector.\nAn Italian farmer producing Grana Padano cheese has been fined almost \u20ac10,000 after an animal rights organisation released a video appearing to show \u201cinconceivable conditions of neglect\u201d allegedly taken at the dairy farm. The video prompted inspections by police and official veterinarians who found several violations of animal welfare regulations. In a statement, industry body the Grana Padano Protection Consortium said that, while by law animal welfare was not its responsibility, it had long been insisting that dairies apply best practice. The consortium added that the case was not representative of the Grana Padano production chain.\nAt least 651,000 farm animal deaths have been linked to the \u201cheat dome\u201d that settled over western Canada and the north-western US for five days in June \u2013 killing more than 500 people and contributing to wildfires. Although the weather event was unprecedented, animal welfare groups say more should have been done to protect animals. Industry bodies and farmers say producers are preparing for extreme heat events.\nConsumers are being encouraged to buy different sized eggs after a study of laying hens uncovered a \u201chuge animal welfare problem\u201d. University of Copenhagen researchers examined 4,800 hens and found almost 4,100 had fractured keel bones (part of a bird\u2019s breastbone). They concluded the fractures were due to hens being bred to be smaller while producing larger eggs, and that it was a global problem found in nearly all production systems \u2013 including among organic and free-range birds.\nSouth Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has proposed banning the eating of dogs in the country, his office said. The meat has long been a part of South Korean cuisine, with about 1 million dogs believed to be eaten annually. But consumption has declined as a growing number of people live with dogs as pets \u2013 including the president \u2013 and the practice is something of a taboo among younger generations.\nFarmers\u2019 ownership of the word \u201cmeat\u201d has been challenged at an Australian Senate inquiry into food labelling. The inquiry, chaired by senator and former butcher shop owner Susan McDonald, is examining whether labelling should be changed to better identify plant-based products. McDonald has said the makers of meat alternatives should not trade off long-established names of animal protein and should instead come up with their own terms.\nThe government announced it is to issue up to 10,500 temporary UK visas for lorry drivers and poultry workers in an attempt to ease the supply chain crisis. Pig farmers warned that supply chain issues could force them to \u201cslaughter their own animals\u201d to dispose of them \u2013 there have already been reports of on-farm culling.\nFelicity Lawrence argued that ever-worsening conditions in supply chain jobs, such as abattoirs and meat plants, had made Britain\u2019s shortages inevitable.\nChanges to farming regulations that will allow field trials of gene edited crops in England were announced by the government. This will be followed by plans to allow greater use of gene editing in crops \u2013 and potentially animals too \u2013 in the UK.\nA single case of BSE has been confirmed on a farm in Somerset. The infected animal was dead and had been removed from the farm, said the Animal and Plant Health Agency, which added that there had been five cases of confirmed BSE in the UK since 2014, all of which have been in animals not destined for the human food chain and posed no risk to the public.\nEighteen celebrities \u2013 including musician Billie Eilish and actor Alicia Silverstone \u2013 have signed a letter urging world leaders to address animal agriculture\u2019s impact on the climate crisis at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Meanwhile, a Labour MP has claimed most livestock farming would be phased out over the next 20 years due to the necessity of meeting the UK\u2019s net zero targets. The UK meat sector has made progress in its ambitions to reduce carbon emissions and food waste, according to a new report by the charity Wrap.\nThank you to everyone who has been in touch with their thoughts on the series. Many readers responded to our investigation into working conditions in Europe\u2019s meat plants, including Peter Dempsey, who said: \u201cYou are probably familiar with The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, written over a century ago. Nothing has changed.\u201d While another reader said: \u201cThe title of the series could be \u2018people farmed\u2019 actually.\u201d\nTo air your views, or share your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry, please contact us at: animalsfarmed@theguardian.com.\nAnd if you want to receive this Animals farmed monthly update via email, you can sign up here to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.",

        "content": "Thirteen years ago, few of us clocked the uncomfortable cross-species drive of Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s 2007 animation. So why has its star now felt the need to bring us up to speed?\n\n  Jerry Seinfeld doesn\u2019t need to be reflective. At this point, his sitcom \u2013 dead for almost 25 years \u2013 is still making money faster than any human being could spend it. When it finished its run in 1998, he was earning a million dollars an episode. He has earned tens of millions more in syndication deals. And now Seinfeld has arrived on Netflix as part of a deal worth over $500m. So Jerry Seinfeld doesn\u2019t need to be reflective. He can quite happily insulate himself from regret, using all the wads and wads of cash he has lying around the place.\nBut still, something has clearly been nagging at him. Between all the hoo-hah of the Netflix deal \u2013 which, let\u2019s not forget, has seen him dress up in a giant Lego costume of himself and tip hundreds of Lego bricks into his mouth for reasons that may never be fully explained \u2013 Seinfeld has taken the time to take stock of his past mistakes and apologise for the most egregious error of his life. Making a film about a bee that wanted to have sex with a human woman.\nThe stock of Seinfeld\u2019s 2007 animated comedy Bee Movie has risen precipitously in the years since its release. At the time it came out, it was largely ignored as a folly; a plaything for a bored millionaire wasteful enough to make an entire film out of what is arguably the worst pun in cinematic history. Contemporary reviews were dismissive. But it was a children\u2019s movie, so children saw it. And then those children grew up and, in a collective epiphany, realised \u201cHang on, was that a film about a bee trying to have sex with a human woman?\u201d\nAnd now, in this punishing climate where every past transgression is summoned back for judgment, Seinfeld has understood that it is time to address this. Yes, in Bee Movie, Jerry Seinfeld played a bee. Yes, in Bee Movie, Rene\u00e9 Zellweger played a human. Yes, in Bee Movie, the bee was uncomfortably horny for the human. And, at the very least, Seinfeld wants to address this.\nAppearing on The Tonight Show last week, Seinfeld mentioned Bee Movie in passing. And when the title got bigger-than-expected applause from the audience, he broke off from his anecdote and said \u201cI apologise for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie. [It] really was not intentional, but after it came out, I realised this is really not appropriate for children. The bee seemed to have a thing for the girl. And we don\u2019t really want to pursue that as an idea in children\u2019s entertainment.\u201d\nWhile at first this seems like a joke, it\u2019s true that Bee Movie has inspired some incredibly weird fans. You can buy Bee Movie phone cases called Barry Benson is HOT AF. An adult website exists that contains a video entitled \u2018Bee Movie trailer but every time they say bee a Japanese girl moans\u2019. Someone has written a piece of Bee Movie fanfiction \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to find this one yourselves \u2013 about Seinfeld\u2019s bee inserting himself into Zellweger\u2019s human and realising with horror that she is pregnant with a human baby.\nPerhaps this is to be expected. You cannot make a movie that contains jokes about bee incest, lust that exists between bees and humans and \u2013 if memory serves correctly \u2013 a horny daydream about a human bursting into a flames and dying as part of a ritualised bee courtship, and not expect some weirdness to come out of it.\nBut then this, of course, is Bee Movie\u2019s appeal. Jerry Seinfeld will always be most famous for Seinfeld, a television sitcom that looked and felt exactly like a television sitcom. But history is destined to remember him for Bee Movie, a kid\u2019s cartoon that looked and felt like a highly specific imported sex DVD. It was a bold swing, and arguably Netflix should pay Seinfeld another half-billion dollars to make a sequel. The last thing he should do is apologise for it.",

        "content": "From first kisses to lockdown days, a cast of disabled and non-disabled performers lay their personal lives on the line in a moving new show, Human\nOn a bare black stage, Jonny Leitch is remembering an act of kindness: a janitor offering him a stick of gum while he sat in a hospital waiting room. As Leitch\u2019s recorded voice narrates the story, a black loop appears suspended from the air and he hoists himself from his wheelchair into it, performing a graceful, balletic arc high above it.\nThis is one of the scenes that makes up Human, the latest production from integrated circus company Extraordinary Bodies. Devised over the past year with a cast of disabled and non-disabled performers, Human combines circus skills with digital recordings to illustrate formative moments in the company members\u2019 lives \u2013 from first kisses to personal traumas and life in lockdown. The result is a polyphony of experiences told through speech, song and movement, centring each tale in the nuances of human life.\nExtraordinary Bodies, which celebrates its 10th anniversary next year, was founded when artistic directors Billy Alwen and Claire Hodgson met while creating an integrated performance for the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. In the years since, the circus company has become the largest of its kind in the UK, prioritising equality of access, race and gender in its performances.\n\u201cBefore Extraordinary Bodies, my experience of working with disabled people in theatre was that people would always think it was really risky,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cBut in circus, people are much better at assessing real risk and not imagined risk. So they would say, \u2018yeah, of course people who are blind can hang off cranes, we just need to work it out\u2019. That was a real breath of fresh air and it gave us the confidence to be radical, joyous and bold.\u201d\nHodgson\u2019s experience as an 18-year-old taking part in a show in which half the cast was disabled was an eye-opener and convinced her that integration would have to be at the core of her future work. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d ever met so many disabled people,\u201d she says. \u201cI got to see how they were often placed into a totally separate experience from childhood. One which we\u2019re all the poorer for.\u201d\nFor Leitch, his route into performance was unusual \u2013 but one that typifies the challenges in finding talent for integrated companies. \u201cI joined the company as a musician, which is what I trained in, but once when I was in the rehearsal room, I mentioned that I used to get around by walking on my hands,\u201d he says. \u201cBilly\u2019s ears pricked up and he asked me to show him. From then on, I\u2019ve become trained as an aerialist, too.\u201d\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t encourage disabled kids who have a physical curiosity to try out circus,\u201d Alwen says. \u201cSo we have to find our talent in unusual ways, since there are very few formalised training paths. We need to show young people that this is a viable opportunity and find all those who should be in circus but who are not here yet.\u201d\nThe value of this representation pays off in empowerment for others. \u201cPeople need to know what disabled lives are like,\u201d Leitch says. \u201cIf a younger disabled audience can see themselves reflected, that changes how they view their possibilities in the world.\u201d For non-disabled dancer and aerialist Alfa Marks, her presence as a mother and a black woman in Extraordinary Bodies has been equally encouraging to audiences, too. \u201cRebecca, who is performing in Humans, has told me many times that it was seeing a video of me that got her into circus,\u201d she says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t realise that you could be muscly and black and still get work. She thought you had to be skinny and blond to succeed in this world.\u201d\nIt is not only the onstage talent that needs to be changed but institutional attitudes too. \u201cIt\u2019s a long, slow revolution,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there has been a big change in representation for TV and film but there are also structural changes that need to happen. Access should be 20% of any budget across the board, since 20% of the population is disabled, but so far the work that we\u2019ve done is to simply put different people at the table. What we haven\u2019t yet done as a society is to take the table away and get out of the room into the real world.\u201d\nHodgson references the work of pioneering British integrated companies such as Graeae and Stopgap, who have paved the way and trained many of the Extraordinary Bodies performers. Yet with the Covid-19 pandemic taking a sledgehammer to an already underfunded performance ecosystem, there are fears that this legacy could vanish.\n\u201cThe UK needs to become the number one place for inclusivity,\u201d says David Ellington, Extraordinary Bodies\u2019 profoundly deaf interpreter. \u201cWe have such a rich history of diverse companies operating against the odds and they have helped show that we are not invisible any more. The pandemic has meant that some performers have had to retrain and there is a risk that many won\u2019t come back, but these lockdowns have shown us that there is a huge value to the arts. Companies like Extraordinary Bodies need to keep going for another 10 years and they can\u2019t be the only ones doing it.\u201d\nUntil then, there is the story of the past 18 months to tell in Human, and it seems that audiences are already being moved. \u201cIt takes a lot of bravery to put such personal stories on stage but I\u2019ve never seen an audience not want to leave a theatre like after these shows,\u201d Alwen says. \u201cThey want to stay and talk about what they\u2019ve seen, as it goes from laughter to tears quite quickly, which is where we\u2019ve all been recently too.\u201d\nHuman is at the Civic, Barnsley, 8-9 October and touring until 14 May.",

Global leaders and campaigners are due to gather in Scotland for the UN climate summit from 31 October.\nPat Mcilvogue, Unite\u2019s industrial officer, said: \u201cThe talks have been spun out and cynically used as a delaying tactic to avoid the national embarrassment of having strike action during the Cop26 climate change conference, which is being held in Glasgow.\n\u201cWe want the Scottish public to know that we have exhausted the process. Unite\u2019s members have been holding action short of strike in an attempt to get Abellio ScotRail to wake up and to recognise the storm that they have created, to no effect. Now strike action will severely disrupt events and the Cop26 climate change conference due to this shambolic company.\u201d\nThere are continuing disputes over pay, lack of investment and services cuts, and the RMT is also balloting on industrial action against ScotRail after a lengthy dispute over conductors\u2019 pay.\nOn Monday Aslef, the RMT, the TSSA and Unite issued a joint statement saying that investment in Scotland\u2019s railways, valuing staff, expanding services and making rail travel more affordable were essential to meeting environmental targets.\nThe Scottish government\u2019s transport secretary, Graeme Dey, told BBC Radio Scotland that he was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d a resolution and that unions needed to \u201cstep back from some of the rhetoric dominating the agenda\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cI understand that later today the unions and ScotRail are meeting and a fresh offer is likely to be tabled. It\u2019s one I hope that the unions will view in the spirit that it is going to be made and consider settling these disputes.\u201d\nA ScotRail spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing customers gradually return to Scotland\u2019s railway, but the scale of the financial situation ScotRail is facing is stark. We will continue to engage with the rail trade unions to find an agreement on pay and conditions.\u201d",

        "content": "Leak appears to show at least \u00a37.5m of Unaoil proceeds were laundered via offshore firms\nThey are the British-Iranian family behind what has been called the \u201cworld\u2019s biggest bribe scandal\u201d.\nFor 17 years, Cyrus Ahsani and his brother Saman Ahsani worked as fixers for multinationals such as Rolls-Royce, bribing officials in Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria.\nNow the Guardian has seen leaked documents that suggest how proceeds made from the family\u2019s firm, Unaoil, were laundered through an intricate chain of offshore companies that secretly helped fund the acquisition of a string of UK properties.\nThe Pandora papers, a huge leak of confidential offshore records shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with the Guardian and other media partners around the world, contains a cache of documents that appears to show how at least \u00a37.5m of Unaoil proceeds were funnelled via offshore companies into investment funds and blended with funds from outside investors.\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world\u2019s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nIt appears that this money was then invested on the advice of a separate Ahsani business in London to acquire seemingly unremarkable \u2013 and often unscrutinised \u2013 assets, including a multiplex cinema in Sunderland, a Humberside business park and an office block in Slough.\nThe portfolio was worth in excess of \u00a3200m, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis of public documents.\nThe revelations \u2013 that millions of pounds of British real estate is tainted by money made at the heart of one of corporate history\u2019s largest proven bribery scandals \u2013 will only add to existing concerns that the UK\u2019s property market is being used by white-collar criminals and kleptocrats to stash fortunes made in corrupt states.\nIn December, the Home Office and Treasury said the money laundering risk in the UK property sector had increased from medium to high since 2017, warning: \u201cCommercial property, particularly office and retail space, remains attractive [to money launderers].\u201d They added: \u201cThe complex, opaque company structures used by overseas entities are less likely to raise suspicion in the commercial sector compared with the residential market.\u201d\nThe disclosures are also likely to raise questions for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The agency has not launched legal action to confiscate the money accumulated by the Ahsanis, even though the family was the focus of one of its most high-profile criminal investigations.\nFive years ago, journalists at Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media exposed Unaoil\u2019s corrupt schemes in what they called the \u201cworld\u2019s biggest bribe scandal\u201d. They uncovered how multinational companies had for years hired Unaoil, the Ahsanis\u2019 Monaco-based firm, to pay bribes to help secure large contracts in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.\nThe fallout from the exposure included both Cyrus and Saman Ahsani pleading guilty in the US during 2019 to facilitating the payment of bribes between 1999 and 2016 to officials in Africa and the Middle East, laundering money in order to conceal the bribes and causing the destruction of evidence to obstruct investigators.\nThey are due to be sentenced in a Texas court in December. In addition, three multinationals have paid penalties in the US for their involvement in the bribery.\nIn the UK courts, the SFO has successfully prosecuted four Unaoil employees, who have been jailed.\nHowever, anti-corruption campaigners are now questioning why Ata Ahsani, the 81-year-old head of the family, has not been prosecuted or charged with any offence in any country. They point out that the SFO has prosecuted junior Unaoil employees but not the family patriarch, who was the founder and chair of Unaoil.\nIn the US, Ata Ahsani has reached an agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) that he will not be prosecuted. Lawyers for the Ahsanis do not dispute this, although it is unclear what the terms of this agreement are.\nTom Martin led the SFO\u2019s investigation into Unaoil between 2016 and 2018. An employment tribunal ruled this year that he was unfairly sacked by the SFO. He told the tribunal that Ata Ahsani struck the deal with the DoJ on the basis that he paid $2m (\u00a31.47m) to the US authorities.\nJim Sturman, a barrister for one of the junior Unaoil employees who was convicted of corruption, alleged in court last year that \u201cremarkably Ata Ahsani seems to have been allowed to buy his way out of any prosecution by paying a financial sum to the US authorities as an alternative to prosecution\u201d.\nAta Ahsani\u2019s lawyers said it was fanciful and intentionally misleading to suggest that \u201cone can (simply) pay any sum of money to receive a non-prosecution agreement\u201d.\nAt the tribunal, Martin also said the Ahsanis had amassed $200m from Unaoil\u2019s corrupt schemes and had at one stage wanted to cut a deal with SFO in exchange for not giving up this fortune.\nLawyers for the Ahsanis said this figure was inaccurate and an inflated assertion by Martin, who had never been able to substantiate it. They added that UK criminal law did not allow the cutting of deals. They said it was wrong to suggest that all of Unaoil\u2019s business was illegitimate, adding that prosecutors in the UK and the US had not found that all profits generated by Unaoil had been derived from bribery.\nSusan Hawley, the executive director of the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said: \u201cWhy are junior employees carrying the can for egregious corrupt activity, by going to jail, while the person who ran the business and is likely to have profited most from Unaoil\u2019s corrupt behaviour gets to walk away paying a minor fine? This sends a terrible message that senior executives are not a priority for prosecutors which seriously undermines the fight against corruption.\u201d\nNow, for the first time, documents reveal how the Ahsani family invested some of its Unaoil proceeds.\nA joint investigation between the Guardian and BBC File on Four has examined documents leaked from an offshore services provider that administered some of the Ahsani offshore empire, and which state three separate British Virgin Islands-based companies, all beneficially owned by Ata Ahsani, invested the money into two property funds called Lumina Real Estate Capital \u201cspecial situations\u201d funds.\nThe papers also record that the source of Ata\u2019s investment was \u201cearnings of Mr [Ata] Ahsani by Unaoil Group\u201d.\nA fourth BVI company, which the leaked records state sold \u00a3600,000-worth of property, is recorded as being funded from \u201cearnings of Mr Ahsani Saman by Unaoil Group\u201d.\nA fifth BVI company, beneficially owned by Ata Ahsani but not linked to Lumina in the leaked papers, is recorded as holding \u20ac6.5m (\u00a35.6m) of \u201coffice spaces\u201d assets \u2013 which were again identified as funds from \u201cearnings of Mr Ahsani by Unaoil Group\u201d.\nLawyers for the Ahsanis said that only about 5% of the two Lumina funds was financed by Ata Ahsani.",

        "content": "Enbridge picked up the tab for police wages, training and equipment \u2013 and let county police know when it wanted demonstrators arrested\nThe Canadian company Enbridge has reimbursed US police $2.4m for arresting and surveilling hundreds of demonstrators who oppose construction of its Line 3 pipeline, according to documents the Guardian obtained through a public records request.\nEnbridge has paid for officer training, police surveillance of demonstrators, officer wages, overtime, benefits, meals, hotels and equipment.\nEnbridge is replacing the Line 3 pipeline through Minnesota to carry oil from Alberta to the tip of Lake Superior in Wisconsin. The new pipeline carries a heavy oil called bitumen, doubles the capacity of the original to 760,000 barrels a day and carves a new route through pristine wetlands. A report by the climate action group MN350 says the expanded pipeline will emit the equivalent greenhouse gases of 50 coal power plants.\nThe project was meant to be completed and start functioning on Friday.\nPolice have arrested more than 900 demonstrators opposing Line 3 and its impact on climate and Indigenous rights, according to the Pipeline Legal Action Network.\nIt\u2019s common for protesters opposing pipeline construction to face private security hired by companies, as they did during demonstrations against the Dakota Access pipeline. But in Minnesota, a financial agreement with a foreign company has given public police forces an incentive to arrest demonstrators.\nThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, which regulates pipelines, decided rural police should not have to pay for increased strain from Line 3 protests. As a condition of granting Line 3 permits, the commission required Enbridge to set up an escrow account to reimburse police for responding to demonstrations.\nEnbridge told the Guardian an independent account manager allocates the funds, and police decide when protesters are breaking the law. But records obtained by the Guardian show the company meets daily with police to discuss intelligence gathering and patrols. And when Enbridge wants protesters removed, it calls police or sends letters.\n\u201cOur police are beholden to a foreign company,\u201d Tara Houska, founder of the Indigenous frontline group Giniw Collective, told the Guardian. \u201cThey are working hand in hand with big oil. They are actively working for a company. Their duty is owed to the state of Minnesota and to the tribal citizens of Minnesota.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very clear violation of the public\u2019s trust,\u201d she added.\nIn July, Enbridge began drilling under the Red Lake River near Thief River Falls. A police report said 20 to 100 demonstrators had gathered next to the site for days. The Pennington county sheriff\u2019s office sent a request for help and several police agencies sent officers to protect the fenced-in drill site.\nBrandon Thyen, Chisago county sheriff, requested Enbridge reimbursement when his deputies were assigned \u201cto protect the construction workers and equipment from activists and protesters\u201d.\nOn 29 July, Houska said Line 3 opponents, who identify as water protectors, attempted to stop the drilling, under skies that were thick with wildfire smoke from the west. \u201cWe were met with rubber bullets and Mace by a big line of police officers from multiple counties shooting at us at point blank range,\u201d she said.\nAt about 5pm a group of protesters ran from a nearby camp to the drill site, leaned ladders against the fence and began to climb over, according to a Wright county police report obtained by the Guardian. Police told them they were under arrest but they kept climbing. Then police fired at protesters with \u201cless-lethal munitions\u201d \u2013 weapons that are more likely to injure than kill someone. Wright county officers fired pepper spray at protesters and arrested four people.\nPolice shot Houska with rubber bullets that left bruises and welts on her skin, photos show. It\u2019s not clear which police agency fired the rubber bullets \u2013 Wright county said it wasn\u2019t them.\nEnbridge reimbursed the Wright county sheriff\u2019s office $26,886.44 for mileage, meals, wages and benefits for officers who worked at the drill site from 28 July to 1 August 2021. The Enbridge fund also reimbursed Anoka, Chisago, Marshall and Clay counties for sending officers to the drill site.\nHouska said she overheard officers saying they would get overtime pay for responding on 29 June. \u201cThey\u2019re excited about the piggy bank Enbridge has created for them,\u201d she said.\nOn 12 March 2021, Grand Rapids police followed several vehicles in Aitkin county that they suspected contained Line 3 protesters. Investigator Brian Mattson followed a Jeep into a mall parking lot. The occupants, a \u201cwhite female and Hispanic or native american male\u201d, recorded him and questioned why he was following them. Sergeant Andrew Morgan wrote in his report that he \u201cmaintained surveillance on multiple believed rally participants\u201d, including monitoring a vehicle that contained a \u201csleeping dragon\u201d device that protesters use to lock themselves to equipment.\nEnbridge reimbursed Grand Rapids $4,048.43 for the wages of nine officers who were patrolling Aitkin county that day.\nFrom 4 to 9 June, in response to a mutual aid request, the McLeod county sheriff\u2019s office sent police to Wadena and Aitkin counties for what they called \u201coperation safety net\u201d. They billed their mileage, wages and meals to the Enbridge account, a total of $15,787.57.\nThe evening of 8 June, the McLeod county officers dined together at the Fireside Inn in Aitkin county. Detective Andrew DeMeyer had buffalo chips and a fiesta salad for $19.15, Deputy Jonathan Robbin had a chicken strip basket, fries and mozzarella sticks for $21.35, Deputy Joshua Fahey had a half chicken with fries for $14.95, and Sgt Billy Kroll enjoyed a bacon cheeseburger, onion rings and two non-alcoholic beers for $22.45. They billed their meals to the Enbridge account.\nOn 7 June hundreds of protesters occupied an Enbridge pump station in Hubbard county, north of Park Rapids, blockading the site and locking themselves to equipment. The Hubbard county sheriff\u2019s office sent a \u201ccode red\u201d to the Beltrami county field force extrication team, which had received training from 2016 to 2020 to remove protesters who used sleeping dragons.\nEnbridge reimbursed the Beltrami county sheriff\u2019s office more than $180,000 for the training and equipment its officers would use that day. This included $17,510.99 for equipment, including ballistic helmets, and another $4,095 for shields.\nBeltrami officers put on their riot helmets, grabbed their shields and boarded a school bus, according to police reports. At the site, they arrested protesters, including elderly people, and people who locked themselves to bulldozers and excavators.\nEnbridge reimbursed Beltrami county sheriff\u2019s office $17,572.22 for police wages and overtime pay for their work that day.\nBeltrami also requested reimbursement for pepper spray and batons, but the manager of the escrow account wrote in an email that these were not personal protective equipment and could not be reimbursed.\nSimone Senogles, member of the Red Lake Nation and leadership team member for the Indigenous Environmental Network, participated in actions on 7 June to protect the Mississippi River and drinking water.\n\u201cYou wish they were actually there to protect and serve us, and not to protect and serve a pipeline and a company,\u201d she said of police. \u201cIt\u2019s the antithesis of democracy in my mind.\u201d\nRecords obtained by the Guardian show a close working relationship between Enbridge and police.\nIn December 2020, Cass county\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office began \u201cproactive safety patrols\u201d of communities along the pipeline route. Up to 6 August the Enbridge account reimbursed the sheriff $849,163.40 for these patrols.\nTom Burch, Cass county sheriff, wrote in his request for reimbursement that a Cass county supervisor was assigned to the project and met several times daily with Enbridge public safety liaison staff to discuss safety concerns, intelligence gathering and public safety initiatives for the day.\nBurch told the Guardian he would have initiated these patrols even if they couldn\u2019t be reimbursed from Enbridge. \u201cCass County Sheriff\u2019s Office does not work for Enbridge,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cCass County Sheriff\u2019s Office responds appropriately to the public safety needs for the citizens of Cass County and our communities.\u201d\nOn 9 January 2021, Kevin Ott, a Grand Rapids police department officer, wrote in a report: \u201cI was contacted by employees of Enbridge who advised me that there were multiple protesters that had occupied their job site to the east of US Hwy #169,\u201d in Aitkin county. He arrested one man who refused to leave the site. Enbridge later reimbursed the Grand Rapids police epartment $1,306.35.\nWinona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, an Indigenous environmental group, told the Guardian she was at the 9 January protest and witnessed an Enbridge employee directing police. \u201cEnbridge has been calling the police shots in northern Minnesota,\u201d she said.\nAsked if the company is directing police, an Enbridge spokesperson, Michael Barnes, wrote in an email: \u201cOfficers decide when protesters are breaking the law \u2013 or putting themselves and others in danger.\u201d\nThe Guardian requested comment from Beltrami county sheriff\u2019s office, Grand Rapids police department and McLeod county sheriff\u2019s office, but did not receive responses by deadline.\nCiting concerns that similar funding models could be replicated in other states, lawyers are close to filing a lawsuit challenging the legality of the escrow fund. \u201cIt presents a dystopian future, that\u2019s why we\u2019re challenging it,\u201d said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a lawyer with the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund.\nIn August, Houska and other water protectors met with the UN special rapporteur on human rights to share their concerns about police and the escrow fund. Houska said the financial relationship had resulted in the criminalization of protest and was setting a precedent that \u201cshould scare anyone\u201d.\n\u201cAs we see the climate crisis raging all around us, and the world is on fire, and the water protectors are in jail, at what point do we step in to prevent a precedent like this being the norm?\u201d Houska asked.",

The initiative will help give exciting black authors the platform to showcase their work, as currently there is not a single black author represented in the Top 50 bestselling books in the UK.\nThe topics covered in the short stories include race, class, sexuality, freedom and religion across generations, time and cultures. Live readings from the authors will take place later this month at Canary Wharf. The Short Story Stations will also publish an extract from Evaristo\u2019s new book, Manifesto, released this week.\nEvaristo said: \u201cThis is such an innovative opportunity at Canary Wharf to shine the spotlight on black authors I admire and are deserving of a wider readership. Some of the chosen stories are part of my curated series with Penguin called Black Britain: Writing Back, and I hope that all of these writers find new readers. Great literature transcends all perceived boundaries and are for everyone.\u201d\nCamilla McGregor, the arts and events planner at Canary Wharf Group, said: \u201cThe Short Story Stations at Canary Wharf are the first of their kind in the UK, having first gained popularity in the US, France and Hong Kong, with thousands of stories printed on recycled paper and read each week. Thousands of people visit Canary Wharf each month, which is a huge platform to showcase writing talent, so we\u2019re proud to be able to play our part in helping Bernardine Evaristo put the spotlight on black authors to help them get the recognition they deserve.\u201d\nAuthored by Gaverne Bennett and created with the British Library, this literary timeline explores the history of Black writing and literature in Britain through around 50 texts.

        "content": "Sykuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi share award for advancing climate knowledge\nThree scientists have won the 2021 Nobel prize in physics for their groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems \u2013 including how humanity influences the Earth\u2019s climate.\nThe winners, Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi, will share the award, announced on Tuesday, presented by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and worth 10m Swedish kronor (\u00a3870,000).\nOne half of the prize was jointly awarded to Manabe and Hasselmann for their physical modelling of Earth\u2019s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global heating. The other half went to Parisi for his discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales.\nCharacterised by randomness and disorder, complex systems are difficult to understand, but this year\u2019s prize recognised new methods for describing them and predicting their long-term behaviour.\nPaul Hardaker, the chief executive of the Institute of Physics, said: \u201cWhilst complex systems are difficult to deal with mathematically they are all around us and affect our lives in many different ways, not least through the way they affect the nature of our weather and climate.\n\u201cTheir work has laid the foundations for our understanding of the Earth system and the impact of our interactions with it. Never has this been more important than in what we are doing now to tackle the challenges of our changing climate and move toward a new green economy.\u201d\nManabe, a senior meteorologist at Princeton University, demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can lead to increased temperatures at the Earth\u2019s surface. During the 1960s he also led the development of physical models of the Earth\u2019s climate, laying the foundations for the climate models in use today.\nAbout 10 years later, Hasselmann, a professor at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, created a separate model that linked together weather and climate, helping to answer the question of why climate models can be reliable despite the weather being changeable and chaotic.\nHe also developed methods for identifying specific signals that natural phenomena and human activities imprint in the climate, demonstrating that increased atmospheric temperatures can be linked to human carbon dioxide emissions.\nProfessor Ralf Toumi, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, said: \u201cIt is almost impossible to imagine that there would be such widespread call for action on climate change without the work of many modellers, but particularly Manabe and Hasselman.\u201d\nParisi\u2019s groundbreaking work focused on identifying hidden patterns in disordered complex materials called spin glasses, making it possible to understand and describe many different and apparently entirely random materials and phenomena.\n\u201c[He] tamed this complicated landscape by building a deep physical and mathematical model which was so broad that it has impacted a vast range of fields far beyond spin glasses, from how granular materials pack, to neuroscience, to how we compute to random lasers, and to emergent phenomenon far beyond what he envisioned in the 1970s when he started this work,\u201d said the Nobel committee member John Wettlaufer, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Yale University in the US.\nThors Hans Hansson, the chair of the Nobel committee for physics, said: \u201cAlthough the prize is divided into two parts, there is the common theme that has to do with how disorder and fluctuations together \u2013 if you understand it properly \u2013 can give rise to something that we can understand and predict.\n\u201cThe discoveries being recognised this year demonstrate that our knowledge about the climate rests on a solid scientific foundation, based on a rigorous analysis of observations. This year\u2019s laureates have all contributed to us gaining deeper insight into the properties and evolution of complex physical systems.\u201d\nAsked about the timing of the award, Parisi, a professor at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, said: \u201cWe are in a situation where we can have a positive feedback that may accelerate the increase of temperature. It is clear that for the future generations, we have to act now in a very fast way and not with a strong delay.\u201d\nPhysics was the prize area that Alfred Nobel mentioned first in his will from 1895, dictating that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow \u201cprizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\u201d.\nThe other awards are prizes for physics and chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and the championship of peace.",

        "content": "Church asks for forgiveness as it accepts findings of \u2018appalling\u2019 abuse by clergy and lay members over 70 years\nThe French Catholic church has expressed \u201cshame\u201d and pleaded for forgiveness, after a devastating report found that at least 330,000 children were victims of sexual abuse by clergy and lay members of church institutions over the past 70 years.\nThe publication of the landmark report on Thursday, France\u2019s first major reckoning with what the Catholic church accepted was \u201cappalling\u201d abuse, has shaken the country with its horrific findings of a \u201cmassive phenomenon\u201d of sexual abusers of children operating for decades within the church and its associated institutions.\nThe two-and-a-half-year independent inquiry found that staggering numbers of children were subjected to sexual violence by priests and clergy while the crimes were covered up in a \u201csystemic way\u201d by a deliberate \u201cveil of silence\u201d in the church.\nThe president of the investigative committee, Jean-Marc Sauv\u00e9, told a press conference: \u201cUntil the early 2000s the Catholic church showed a profound and even cruel indifference towards the victims.\u201d\nThe report found an estimated 216,000 children were victims of sexual violence by French Catholic priests, deacons and other clergy from 1950 to 2020. When lay members of the Church, such as teachers and catechism supervisors, were included, the figure rose to at least 330,000 children sexually abused over 70 years.\nIt said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of victims were boys, who came from a wide variety of social backgrounds and who were attacked at a young age before reaching adolescence. Some sex offenders inside the church were \u201cpredators\u201d on a vast scale who targeted extremely high numbers of children over long periods, with some attacking more than 150 victims.\nSauv\u00e9 said the numbers of victims were \u201cdamning\u201d and \u201cin no way can remain without a response\u201d. He urged the church to pay reparations even though most cases were well beyond the statute of limitations for prosecution. He recommended the Catholic church overhaul its internal legal system, reform its governance, rethink training and look at the dynamics that allowed the abuse to take place \u2013 namely the overwhelming power of priests and \u201cthe identification of a priest to Christ\u201d.\nThe report made a \u201cminimum estimate\u201d of between 2,900 and 3,200 sexual abusers of children who operated in the French catholic church since 1950, yet it said only a handful of cases had prompted disciplinary action under canonical law, let alone criminal prosecution.\nFran\u00e7ois Devaux, who set up the victims\u2019 association La Parole Lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, told church representatives at the public presentation of the report: \u201cYou must pay for all these crimes.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cYou are a disgrace to our humanity \u2026 In this hell there have been abominable mass crimes ... but there has been even worse, betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children.\u201d He accused the church of cowardice and condemned a \u201cdeviant system\u201d, saying what was needed was a comprehensive response under a new \u201cVatican III\u201d council led by Pope Francis.\nLast year, Devaux\u2019s attacker, the now defrocked priest Bernard Preynat, was convicted of sexually abusing minors and given a five-year prison sentence. Preynat acknowledged abusing more than 75 boys for decades.\nArchbishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, president of the Bishops\u2019 Conference of France, which co-requested the report, expressed his \u201cshame and horror\u201d at the findings. \u201cMy wish today is to ask forgiveness from each of you,\u201d he told a news conference. He said: \u201cThe time for ambiguity and na\u00efvity is over\u201d, adding that he was \u201cshaken\u201d by the voices of survivors and the \u201cunbearable\u201d damage to the lives of children and young people.\nSurvivors who spoke out to report investigators included Claudette Couturier, 65, who told France TV that her first memories as a very young child were of being raped by three priests who took turns to attack her. She and her sister lived with her alcoholic grandmother. The priests would come to dinner then attack the children in their bedrooms. \u201cThey stole 13 years of my life,\u201d Couturier said. She added that before she and her sister were able to be interviewed for the independent report, they had lived in silence, which was extremely damaging.\nShe said: \u201cFrom the moment I didn\u2019t denounce what was happening, it was me who was the disgusting one, me who was the guilty one. ... With everything that happened to me, there was a profound thought that I was the one to blame because I let them do it.\u201d\nSauv\u00e9 and his team said victims had faced suffering, shame, isolation and often blame. In the report he wrote: \u201cIf the veil of silence covering the acts committed has finally been torn open ... we owe it to the courage of these victims. Without their testimony, our society would still be unaware or in denial of what happened.\u201d\nThe report found the huge scale of sexual abuse in the Catholic church was higher than in other institutions such as state schools, holiday camps and sporting organisations. \u201cThe Catholic church is, after the circle of family and friends, the environment that has the highest prevalence of sexual violence,\u201d the report said.",

        "content": "Global chip shortage helps push car registrations to lowest level for more than two decades\nThe number of electric cars sold in the UK last month neared the figures for the whole of 2019, with panic-buying at the petrol pumps expected to accelerate consumer appetite to switch to cleaner vehicles.\nNearly 33,000 pure electric cars were registered in a record month for EVs, almost 50% more than last year, as sales of new cars otherwise tumbled to the weakest September total for more than two decades.\nThe global shortages of semiconductors affecting car manufacturers was a major factor as only 215,312 new cars in total were registered last month, the worst number since 1998, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\nNumbers were a third down from even last September, when Covid-19 restrictions were dampening the buying and selling of cars, and down almost 45% compared with the 10-year average before the pandemic.\nSeptember is normally the second-busiest month of the year for the industry. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the headline figures were \u201cdesperately disappointing\u201d and further evidence of the impact that the shortage of semiconductors, especially from Asia, was having on the industry.\nBattery-powered cars took a record slice of the new car market in a month that ended with fuel supply issues dominating the news, as motorists struggled to find petrol or diesel to fill their tanks. About 15% of new cars sold were pure electric, up from 11% in August, with almost 7,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles alone joining Britain\u2019s roads as the bestselling EV.\nWith long lead times for most EV deliveries, analysts said it was too soon for the impact of the fuel crisis to show up in sales. However, Jamie Hamilton, automotive director at Deloitte, added: \u201cThe inconvenience of long queues and empty pumps has jump-started many motorists to explore the switch to electric.\u201d\nCar retail websites such as Auto Trader reported surging interest in electric cars after 24 September, when news that the shortage of lorry and tanker drivers was affecting forecourt fuel supplies led to widespread panic-buying at the pumps.\nJames Fairclough, the chief executive of AA Cars, said: \u201cFor those already thinking of going electric, the sight of electric vehicle drivers breezing past long queues at service stations during September\u2019s fuel crisis may have been a clincher.\u201d\nHawes called on the government to step up investment in charging points. \u201cThe rocketing uptake of plug-in vehicles, especially battery electric cars, demonstrates the increasing demand for these new technologies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHowever, to meet our collective decarbonisation ambitions, we need to ensure all drivers can make the switch \u2013 not just those with private driveways \u2013 requiring a massive investment in public recharging infrastructure. Charge-point rollout must keep pace with the acceleration in plug-in vehicle registrations.\u201d\nPlug-in hybrid cars also increased their share to 6.4%, meaning more than one in five new cars sold in September was capable of zero-emission driving.\nSales of diesel cars continued their steep decline, with 77% fewer sold than a year ago. Only one in 20 new cars sold in the UK was a pure diesel last month.\nOverall demand for new cars fell most among large fleet buyers, who bought 43% fewer vehicles than a year ago. Demand from private buyers fell 25% from last September. New car sales so far this year are only 5.9% better than 2020 figures \u2013 the worst year for three decades \u2013 and down 29% on the pre-pandemic decade-long average.\nSe\u00e1n Kemple, the managing director of Close Brothers Motor Finance, said it could be March next year before there was a real recovery in car sales.\n\u201cThe ongoing chip shortage, compounded by rocketing manufacturing costs, continues to present challenges for dealers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cConsumer demand is there, but choice is stifled. Buyers are turning to \u2018nearly new\u2019 options, a growing trend where vehicles up to 12 months old are outstripping the price of their new counterparts. The supply chain pressures are unlikely to ease up this side of Christmas and with secondhand vehicles going for premium prices, customers looking for a car are left in an unenviable position.\u201d\nTesla Model 3 \u2013 6,879\nVolkswagen ID.3 \u2013 2,056\nKia Niro \u2013 1,881\nRenault Zoe \u2013 1,337\nMercedes EQA \u2013 1,325\nAudi e-tron \u2013 1,318\nMG 5 \u2013 1,135\nNissan Leaf \u2013 1,066\nHyundai Kona \u2013 1,010\nPeugeot e-208 \u2013 946",

        "content": "Autumn internationals could prove dangerous for Eddie Jones, who needs to conjure up major improvements after last season\u2019s disappointments\nFor those scheduled to face South Africa on the world champions\u2019 northern hemisphere tour this autumn, the weekend was an ominous one. In producing easily their best performance since winning the 2019 Rugby World Cup the Springboks went back to the future in compelling fashion, narrowly edging out New Zealand in a tumultuous finale in the 101st meeting between the two proud rivals.\nIf it made for uncomfortable viewing for Wales, Scotland and England, who are all due to host the Boks next month, it was compounded by the subsequent social media footage of Rassie Erasmus dancing around in his boxer shorts at home in celebration. Very little Erasmus posts online happens accidentally and here was a timely nudge that South Africa\u2019s camera-loving director of rugby is not huddled in a darkened room fretting about World Rugby\u2019s still-pending inquiry into his well-publicised Lions tour antics.\nLet us pray it does not lead to a rash of copycat videos \u2013 Eddie Jones in his budgie smugglers, Gregor Townsend in a tartan onesie \u2013 regardless of how much the social media personnel at Twickenham and Murrayfield would love the viral hits. For Jones, though, an even more alarming scenario would be England being stripped tactically bare by a resurgent Bok squad and an improving Wallabies team also showing signs of renewed bounce.\nClearly, there remain some Covid uncertainties \u2013 and having spent so long in assorted bubbles who knows whether South Africa can sustain the kind of dynamism and momentum that ultimately undid New Zealand? But what if the return of Duane Vermeulen continues to have a similarly striking effect on those around him and a buzzing Cheslin Kolbe is back available? Suddenly the plodding Lions series will recede further still into the background.\nIf any further reminder was needed of how significant this autumn is becoming for Jones and his future plans, it has arrived in the shape of Siya Kolisi\u2019s autobiography, which details how rattled England were from early on in the World Cup final in Yokohama. According to Kolisi, South Africa had known in advance they might be. \u201cWhen they\u2019re under the cosh they start to lose it little by little,\u201d he quotes Erasmus as advising the squad in the buildup. \u201cPlay on that. Lean on them, wear them down, make them turn on each other.\u201d\nHistory records that is largely what happened. England can be brutal on the front foot but, as their fifth-placed finish in the last Six Nations underlined, the sum of their parts does not always add up to what it could. They have three new assistant coaches in Richard Cockerill, Martin Gleeson and Anthony Siebold, who have one preparatory game, against Tonga, to bed in their ideas. Any notion of a routine, low-key autumn for England is fading by the day.\nScotland and Wales also have some points to prove, but imagine the howls from English supporters, for example, if their side go down disappointingly to the Boks and the Wallabies.\nFirst up in the Six Nations in February is Scotland away. Murrayfield is never the easiest venue for an Englishman even if, like Cockerill, you were recently Edinburgh\u2019s head coach. Having supporters back at a full Twickenham will be great but not so much, from the management\u2019s perspective, if a torrent of boos is raining down from the stands.\nThe final England squad is due to be announced on Monday week and Jones\u2019s selection dilemma has, if nothing else, been sharpened by Saturday\u2019s events on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast. In theory, this is the time to be lobbing the keys to Marcus Smith, Adam Radwan, Max Malins, Freddie Steward and some other promising young English backs and accelerating their progress to the 2023 World Cup squad. But is that going to work if South Africa arrive with a pumped up \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and their forwards start grinding England into the same kind of Japanese pulp as two years ago?\nIf Jones plays safe and sticks with the old guard, however, the Boks will scent uncertainty and fancy reopening old scars. Kolisi is now on record saying that South Africa used their England-based players, such as Faf de Klerk, Schalk Brits and Vincent Koch, to supply inside knowledge of the habits and weaknesses of several of England\u2019s star men. Jones may be better off trying something for which the Boks may be less well prepared.\nThat said, maybe there is a bigger picture we are all missing. New Zealand, until the fateful last penalty by Elton Jantjies that clinched the 31-29 win, were again close to knocking over the world champions without Sam Whitelock and Aaron Smith and with the influential Richie Mo\u2019unga and Damian McKenzie on the bench.\nThe tries the All Blacks did score, particularly Ardie Savea\u2019s outstanding team effort, were prime examples of how lethal they remain off stolen set-piece or turnover ball; this was also the first time they have lost a Test to South Africa having led at half-time since 1998.\nThe moral of the story is twofold: New Zealand remain a good side and with France improving and the Wallabies reunited with some of their better overseas-based players the home unions have to up their games. The British and Irish public already wants reassurance the Lions was just a bad dream and they want it yesterday. Jones does not have to post videos of himself dancing without any strides on but England fans are desperate for a glimpse of something refreshingly different.",

        "content": "Condemnation by MEPs and Oxfam prompted by removal of Anguilla, Dominica and Seychelles\nEU finance ministers have removed Anguilla, Dominica and Seychelles from the bloc\u2019s blacklist of tax havens, ignoring critics in the European parliament who described the move as wrong and \u201cgrotesque\u201d after the Pandora papers revelations.\nMeeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, the bloc\u2019s 27 finance ministers approved a decision to remove the three jurisdictions, saying that while they \u201cdo not yet comply with all international tax standards\u201d, they \u201chave committed to implementing tax good-governance principles\u201d.\nThe EU tax-haven list, created in 2017 to clamp down on tax avoidance and tax evasion, now has nine jurisdictions blacklisted as \u201cnon-cooperative\u201d: American Samoa, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, US Virgin Islands, and Vanuatu.\n\u201cThe EU is shutting its eyes to real tax havens while considering blacklisting poor countries who do not sign up to the imminent global tax agreement,\u201d Oxfam\u2019s EU tax expert, Chiara Putaturo, said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision to delist Anguilla, the only remaining jurisdiction with a 0% tax rate, and the Seychelles, which are at the heart of the latest tax scandal, renders the EU\u2019s blacklist a joke.\n\u201cWhile the Pandora papers investigation blew the lid on how the super-rich continue to use tax havens to avoid paying their taxes, ordinary people are asked to foot the Covid-19 recovery bill.\u201d\nMEPs across the political spectrum have also criticised the EU blacklist for leaving out major tax havens. Ahead of the decision, the German Green MEP Sven Giegold said that removing the three jurisdictions was \u201cgrotesque\u201d.\nThe Pandora papers should be a wake-up call, Giegold added. \u201cThe Pandora papers show that the advances in international tax cooperation are not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe global minimum tax only applies to large corporations, but not to the letterbox companies of the wealthy and corrupt. We need full international transparency about the real owners of letterbox companies and real estate.\u201d\nPrior to the vast data leak, EU officials had begun discussions on whether to overhaul the criteria that determines which countries feature on the blacklist. Meanwhile, the European Commission has promised new legal proposals to crack down on shell companies before the end of the year.\nThe Pandora papers expos\u00e9 has touched two serving EU leaders, the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, and the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, who served as his country\u2019s finance minister. Neither man is accused of doing anything illegal.\nAlso in the firing line is Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra, who invested \u20ac26,500 (\u00a322,620) in the British Virgin Islands, an action that was not illegal, but has raised questions about his judgment. He sold his shareholding the week before he became finance minister in 2017 and told Dutch media he had given the profits to charity.\nFor critics, the Pandora papers highlight problems with the union\u2019s tax blacklist.\nMEPs and activists have criticised the exclusion of other low-tax jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, which features in the Pandora papers, but is not on the EU blacklist.\n\u201cSome of the world\u2019s most notorious tax havens are not even listed by the EU and tomorrow EU finance ministers are set to let even more off the hook,\u201d said French Socialist MEP Aurore Lalucq, who has drafted a resolution calling for a crackdown on tax havens, which MEPs will vote on this Thursday. \u201cSadly, the countries that remain blacklisted do not represent the most important financial flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to know exactly who is asking for what in the council, especially if some ministers are involved in tax evasion scandal,\u201d she added.\nGerman MEP Markus Ferber, who is the European People\u2019s party spokesman on economic affairs, said the revelations showed the EU blacklist had no teeth.\n\u201cThe Pandora papers show once more that the fight against tax havens and letter box companies is only making limited progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current approach of exchanging nicely worded letters simply doesn\u2019t cut it. We need to reset the EU blacklist and make sure that it contains all the usual suspects and come up with sanctions that are an effective deterrent.\u201d\nThe European parliament has no say in approving the blacklist, as EU ministers zealously guard their sole competence over EU lawmaking on taxation.\nResponding to criticism of the blacklist, Paolo Gentiloni, the EU commissioner for the economy, said: \u201cIs this working as it should? Well, of course, not completely because we all know that \u2026 tax havens are always looking for and finding new ways [to operate], but in principle I think this is the way to follow, to put pressure and use the leverage to impose changes.\u201d\nSlovenia\u2019s finance minister, Andrej \u0160ircelj, who chaired the meeting, struck a more fatalistic note about the EU\u2019s ability to compel non-EU jurisdictions to be transparent on tax. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s very difficult to avoid these tax systems, because they \u2026 don\u2019t want to recognise and adopt \u2026 international regulations, international rules.\u201d\nGentiloni described the Pandora papers as very important and promised an EU proposal to tackle shell companies before the end of the year.",

        "content": "With the Next Generation 2021 picks out this week we look at the final updates for the class of 2016. How did they fare?\nThere was a time when going abroad wasn\u2019t cool. It was a time when British footballers stayed at home, worried about how they might fare in Europe and beyond.\nGary Lineker helped to break the mould with his switch \u2013 and success \u2013 at Barcelona in the 1980s but Ian Rush\u2019s struggles at Juventus around the same time seemed to put off many players.\nIt would take 30 years before there was a significant shift in attitude, Jadon Sancho paving the way for a generation of players to try their luck abroad.\nIn 2016, Sancho was one of 20 players chosen by the Guardian as the most promising at Premier League clubs. Ten months later, in August 2017, he joined Borussia Dortmund, having turned down a lucrative contract with Manchester City. Pep Guardiola did not want to lose him but Sancho had made up his mind. The thinking was clear: at Dortmund there was an obvious path to the first team, whereas at City there was not.\nSancho was given the No 7 shirt and made a first-team impact straight away, featuring in 12 league games in 2017-18, scoring one goal and making four assists.\nAnother, less high-profile, case of a player moving abroad to further his career can also be found among the 2016 Next Generation picks: Angel Gomes. A huge prospect at Manchester United, he turned down a new deal in the summer of 2020 and joined Lille.\nIt was clear that in many ways he did not want to leave United but he said it was time \u201cto take the next step\u201d in his career. He posted the following heartfelt message on Instagram: \u201cIt\u2019s took me a while because it\u2019s not been easy to put my emotions into words. Sadly the time has come to end a beautiful chapter that has been my life for 14 years. Being from Salford, Manchester United is all I have ever known.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI want to thank every single individual at the club for the help and encouragement I received, from the very first time I signed at the club. I want to thank all the coaches from every age group that looked after me from six to now. To all the kit men, Kath the receptionist, the media team, the security, the staff at the Cliff, the staff at Littleton Road, the staff at Carrington to the cleaners, you all played a part in getting me to where I am today. It is time I take the next step in my career, I hope you can all be proud of what I go on to achieve.\u201d\nGomes had pretty much everything he could have wanted at United, apart from first-team minutes. During his first season at Lille he went on loan to Boavista, making an impressive 30 league appearances, scoring six goals and contributing six assists.\nHe is back at Lille and having made an impression in Ligue 1 and the Champions League got his first England Under-21 call-up last week.\nGomes is one of 10 players from the 20 selected for the Premier League 2016 Next Generation who have made a top-flight appearance. Interestingly, the four who have made the most \u2013 Sancho, Gomes, Reiss Nelson, who is on loan at Feyenoord from Arsenal, and AEK Larnaca\u2019s Simranjit Thandi \u2013 have had stints abroad.\nAs well as selecting 20 of the most promising first-year scholars in the Premier League, each year we pick 60 talents from across the world who we follow for five years. Previous picks have included Marcus Rashford, Youri Tielemans and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in 2014 and Trent Alexander-Arnold, Martin \u00d8degaard, Dani Olmo and Christian Pulisic.\nThe 2016 list provides a similar mix of hits and misses and is further proof of how hard it is to reach the top even if you are one of the most talented players in the world in that year. There is still a lot of blood, sweat and tears before that professional contract or sustained first-team run is secured.\nThe standout players from the 2016 list are Gianluigi Donnarumma and Kai Havertz, Euro 2020 and Champions League winners in 2021 respectively, with Matthijs de Ligt, Alexander Isak, Abdulkadir Omur and Brahim D\u00edaz also among the players who have had huge success.\nAlmost a third (18 of 60) of the players have gone on to win a senior cap, an impressive ratio considering all the pitfalls. Some have stayed at the same club for a long time, such as Vahan Bichakhchyan, who has been at Zilina since 2017 and progressed through their system to become a regular Armenia international.\nDujon Sterling, though, has been loaned out by Chelsea three times since 2016, currently to Blackpool.\nThere is no secret formula but it is heartening to see how some of these young players have recovered from serious injuries to make it to the top. Sometimes, though, it is simply not possible to beat the injuries and in May of this year one of our players from 2016, USA\u2019s Nick Taitague, revealed he would have to stop playing at the age of 22.\n\u201cWith a very sad heart, I write to you all today to announce my retirement from professional soccer,\u201d he posted on Instagram. \u201cWhile I tried my best to play through the pain and surgery it progressed to a point of no return.\u201d",

Video of his remarks was first published by the Daily Beast.\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t had the vaccine,\u201d the 66-year-old said, \u201cyou ought to think about getting it because if you\u2019re my age \u2026\n\u201cNo!\u201d yelled audience members.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to get it,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou ought to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d people in the crowd yelled again.\nGraham said he was glad he got the vaccine, and said 92% of people hospitalized in South Carolina with Covid-19 were not vaccinated.\n\u201cFalse!\u201d the crowd cried. \u201cNot true!\u201d\nThe overwhelming majority of hospitalisations and deaths from the coronavirus in the US are among unvaccinated people. The US death toll recently passed 700,000.\nGraham has been vaccinated. Other Republican senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin prominent among them, have not, and continue to spread misinformation. The GOP is fighting vaccine mandates, issued by government bodies and businesses, on the grounds that they violate individual freedoms and as an attack line against the Biden administration.\nGraham is not the first prominent Republican to be booed for suggesting an audience get a vaccine. It happened to Donald Trump in August, at a rally in Alabama.\n\u201cI\u2019m with you on \u2026 [vaccine] mandates,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m with you that it\u2019s probably unconstitutional \u2026 The truth is that unvaccinated people \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna lose my job in 60 days,\u201d a man shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop it now.\u201d\n\u201cFrom who?\u201d Graham asked.\n\u201cFrom the US government,\u201d the man said. \u201cThe navy.\u201d\n\u201cOK,\u201d said Graham, who was once an air force lawyer. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran too. How many of you have taken measles shots?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same!\u201d audience members cried.\nGraham pressed on: \u201cIn the military, they can say you\u2019ve got to get vaccinated.\u201d\nThe Department of Defense currently administers 17 vaccines \u201cfor the prevention of infectious diseases among military personnel, where appropriate\u201d. The Pentagon has mandated vaccination against Covid-19.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a dumb idea,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou know why? You shouldn\u2019t be driving people away from serving. Like if you\u2019re a healthcare worker and you don\u2019t want to get vaccinated. Why do you want to get people to quit being nurses? I trust you to make a decision that\u2019s good for you.\u201d\nAcross the US, healthcare systems have fired staff members, both frontline hospital workers and those who provide services in support, for refusing to get a vaccine.",

        "content": "Well-connected Old Etonian has shifted party towards accepting money from those with deep pockets \u2013 and offshore links\n\nA year into his premiership, with Covid restrictions easing, Boris Johnson invited a few friends round for a film night at his Downing Street flat.\nGuests included the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, Johnson\u2019s then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, Ben Goldsmith, brother of Tory peer Zac, and Ben Elliot, the Conservative party co-chairman.\nThey gathered to watch Fire in Babylon, a documentary about West Indies cricket in the 1970s and 80s produced by Elliot and Goldsmith a decade earlier. \u201cThey loved it,\u201d said Ben Goldsmith. \u201cThe PM grew up watching these guys.\u201d Goldsmith described Elliot as \u201ca very good friend of mine\u201d and \u201ca big cricket fan\u201d.\nThe summer evening was a much-needed break after months of national woe and Johnson\u2019s own serious brush with Covid-19. It was instructive too. It demonstrated the behind-the-scenes role played by Elliot, an Etonian and nephew of Prince Charles, who was appointed by the prime minister as co-chair of the Conservative party in July 2019.\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world\u2019s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d.\nWhy do people move money offshore?\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don\u2019t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong?\nNo. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.\nThe party has raised more than \u00a370m since Elliot took over at the helm, including the record sum of \u00a337m in the last quarter of 2019 as Johnson went to the polls, more than three times Labour\u2019s \u00a310m.\nBut as the party\u2019s cash continues to pile up, so do the questions for Conservative high command. The investigation by the Guardian, the BBC\u2019s Panorama and International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has put a spotlight on the links between Tory party coffers and offshore finance.\nElliot\u2019s appearance at the top of the Conservative party has left some in Tory circles feeling uncomfortable. It is not unusual to install a well-connected businessman into the role to persuade their moneyed contacts to back the party. Lord Saatchi performed the role for Michael Howard, while David Cameron made the same use of his old friend and tennis partner Andrew Feldman.\nBut something was different about Elliot\u2019s approach from the start. His connections, which span from royalty to his own high-net worth business clients at the luxury concierge service Quintessentially, appeared superior to anything the party has known before. \n At the heart of the concern is that Johnson and Elliot have expanded the Conservative party\u2019s reliance on a \u201ccash for access\u201d culture \u2013 leading to allegations that rich businessmen and women seeking influence can donate money and expect access to Boris Johnson and senior cabinet ministers in return.\n The party has long been criticised for allowing this elite tier of donors who have given more than \u00a350,000 to attend dinners with prime ministers from David Cameron to Theresa May.\nBut under Elliot\u2019s tenure, the party has taken the practice to the next level, with an \u201cadvisory board\u201d for major contributors, some of whom are reported to have given more than \u00a3250,000.\n\u201cTory donors are this mix of people who want to get ahead, to buy respectability and those who want something in terms of policy,\u201d says Peter Geoghegan, the author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Politics and Dirty Money, and editor-in-chief of OpenDemocracy.\nElliot took over as chairman at a time when some traditional captains of industry had stopped donating as much money because of unhappiness with Johnson\u2019s \u201cfuck business\u201d attitude over Brexit, while some of the pro-leave donors had stopped giving money because of frustration over Theresa May\u2019s attempts to soften the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.\nElliot\u2019s task was to restore the cash-pile again, ready for Johnson\u2019s bid for his own electoral mandate. \u201cBen\u2019s job is to squeeze the donors till the pips squeak,\u201d says one Tory minister.\nAnd how they have squeaked.\nSince taking over, Elliot has shaken up Conservative central office, CCHQ, running what one insider described as a \u201cseparate operation\u201d. Some staff are upset. Others are admiring. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely charming and puppyish,\u201d one said of Elliot. \u201cBut he belongs to a clique of the really rich.\u201d\n One former CCHQ staffer recalled him entering the room \u201clike a silverback gorilla, a lot of macho energy going on\u201d, and demanding results in what the staffer described as a brusque, aggressive tone during the 2019 election campaign.\nBut one former senior No 10 staffer offered another view.\nThey felt he \u201calways had time for people, was very personable and a breath of fresh air\u201d, adding: \u201cHe believes in the party and takes a lot of criticism for his work when it would be easier and more lucrative to do other things.\u201d\nMany hedge fund donors returned to the Tory fold, along with some new super-rich names, and gave more money than ever at the 2019 election. But how much due diligence was done on some of these donors in the rush to raise cash for Johnson\u2019s big election?\n\u201cHe seemed to be ruthlessly efficient at it,\u201d says Geoghegan. \u201cThe way Elliot operated in terms of going back to donors with very hard asks: it seems to be taking the traditional fundraising model and pushing it even further.\n\u201cBut there also seem to be more potential conflicts of interest as well with Elliot given his business, Quintessentially. He could be accused of building his business at the same time as Tory fundraising.\u201d\nThe charge is denied by Elliot. A spokesperson for him said his \u201cwork with Quintessentially is entirely separate from his voluntary role as Conservative party chairman\u201d.\nThe Pandora papers has highlighted the business dealings of Mohamed Amersi, who was one of those who paid \u00a315,000 a year to be a member of Quintessentially\u2019s elite tier.\nIn 2013, Elliot organised for him to meet his uncle, Prince Charles, over a dinner at Dumfries House in Scotland. Amersi has since donated to royal charities and given \u00a3750,000 to the Conservatives.\nIn an ironic twist, it was Amersi who revealed the existence of the higher-tier donor group. He told the Financial Times the advisory board was \u201clike the very elite Quintessentially clients membership: one needs to cough up \u00a3250,000 per annum or be a friend of Ben\u201d. Amersi said he was not a member.\nOver the summer, Amersi turned on the Tories \u2013 accusing them of \u201caccess capitalism\u201d.\n\u201cYou get access, you get invitations, you get privileged relationships if you are part of the set-up, and where you are financially making a contribution to be a part of that set-up. Absolutely,\u201d he said at the time.\nNow, a source of some of Amersi\u2019s own wealth and suitability as a donor have been called into question by the Guardian and BBC Panorama\u2019s investigation into offshore cash.\nAnother top tier donor who gave that sum in 2020 and 2021 is Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband, Vladimir, served in Vladimir Putin\u2019s government as a deputy finance minister.\nMrs Chernukhin won the star lot at the party\u2019s last fundraising ball \u2013 a game of tennis with Johnson and Elliot. Vladimir Chernukhin makes extensive use of the British Virgin Islands, with assets earned from his time in Moscow parked offshore, the Pandora papers show.\nThe Conservatives say Mrs Chernukhin has \u201clived in Britain for many years and is a British citizen, which gives her the democratic and legal right to donate to a political party\u201d.\nThen, there is Viktor Fedotov. Aquind, a firm he co-owns, has donated more than \u00a3400,000 to the Conservatives and some of its senior politicians since 2018. Before then, his company Offshore Group Newcastle was also a major donor.\nLawyers for Aquind have stressed Fedotov did not personally donate to the Conservative party, was not involved in the management of the company and had \u201cno influence\u201d over its donations. Fedotov\u2019s lawyers said he \u201chas never had any interest in British politics and has operated in an open and transparent manner throughout the course of his career\u201d.\nHis majority ownership of Aquind was only recently made public, after questions about who was behind its controversial bid to build a \u00a31.2bn subsea electricity cable to France and concerted lobbying of ministers. The Conservatives say government policy is \u201cin no way influenced by the donations the party receives \u2013 they are entirely separate\u201d.\nOutside of the Pandora papers, there is the scandal surrounding Petrofac, whose boss, Ayman Asfari, and his wife have donated almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party.\nThe multinational oil firm last week struck a deal to settle a corruption investigation with the Serious Fraud Office, admitting that its employees paid bribes to land contracts between 2011 and 2015. On Monday, it was fined \u00a370m after admitting it used \u201csystemic\u201d bribery to secure large contracts\nAll these cases are separate \u2013 and in every case, the allegations against those involved have been strenuously denied.\nCritics argue Johnson and Elliot have taken a far too relaxed approach to the reputational risk. The most notable of these was the fast-track planning approval for Richard Desmond, a Tory donor, property developer and former proprietor of the Express, who had been lobbying for a quick process to avoid \u00a340m in tax. This was speeded through by Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, and a \u00a312,000 donation was made by Desmond two weeks later.\nThe decision had to be rescinded, with Jenrick saying he regretted exchanging messages with Desmond after sitting next to him at a fundraising dinner, but claiming there was \u201cno bias whatsoever\u201d.\nCCHQ sources say Elliot did not invent the advisory board. But, they say, he has \u201creshaped\u201d it. He has transformed the party\u2019s funding model so it is now less reliant on donations from old-school entrepreneurs.\nConsequently, Tory insiders say, Elliot has targeted the international super-rich. The Tories insist all their donations are declared, and that fundraising is an integral part of the democratic process.\nThis is true \u2013 but the party\u2019s shift towards accepting money from those with deep offshore links means further scandal seems likely.\nThe Conservative party has previously claimed that it follows money-laundering guidance governed by the Financial Conduct Authority requiring registered firms to undertake beneficial owner checks on customers, and donors have to agree to checks on their backgrounds when signing up to give money.\nAll parties carry out \u201cpermissibility checks\u201d to make sure cash is given by UK-based voters, registered overseas voters, or UK-based organisations, which are governed by the Electoral Commission. However, there is no legal requirement for them to undertake the equivalent of anti-money-laundering checks on the source of the money. Some also question how thorough and professional their checks have been.\nDaniel Beizsley, research consultant at Spotlight on Corruption, says more should be done to ascertain the source of money \u2013 in line with those that apply to buying a house or art dealing \u2013 to prevent scandals engulfing party financing.\n\u201cSome parties claim to follow Financial Conduct Authority advice on checking the source of donations, but \u2026 basic anti-money-laundering checks should be mandatory for all parties with more guidance published on the triggers in place that would require further, enhanced due diligence checks,\u201d he says.\n\u201cEnhanced due diligence checks could look at whether the donor is subject to a law enforcement investigation at the time of donation, and whether the party wanted to take on the reputational risk of taking cash from an entity facing criminal prosecution.\u201d\nHowever, none of this reputational risk appears to faze a prime minister who feels at the peak of his powers.\nIn his new elections bill, Johnson plans to prevent the Electoral Commission trying to take on a prosecutorial function, and seeks to abolish a rule that currently prevents donors who live abroad for more than 15 years from making political contributions.\nAll the while, the merry-go-round of donors and politicians continues. Last month, Johnson was guest of honour at a Tory donor lunch, costing \u00a35,000 a table, held in a Mayfair hotel.\nDonors and businesspeople are paying \u00a32,900 a head to attend the Conservative party conference business day this week, including policy sessions with ministers and an appearance from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\nA Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cThe Conservative party is funded by membership, fundraising and donations. Donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them, and comply fully with the law,\u201d she added.\n\u201cFundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is more taxpayer-funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals.\u201d\nMargaret Hodge, the Labour former chair of the public accounts watchdog who has relentlessly campaigned against corporate tax avoidance, is not convinced.\nShe says things have changed since the \u201ccash for access\u201d scandals of the New Labour years in that there is less shock about such practices these days.\n\u201cThere is such a nonchalant attitude about it at the top from Boris downwards. There is complete acceptance. Cash for access has just become mainstream now.\u201d",

        "content": "Man, one of 150 staff who applied to be evacuated to UK, suffers fractured skull and hand in attack\nA former employee of the British embassy in Kabul has been badly beaten at his home by five armed men, in an attack linked to his 11 years working with UK diplomats in Afghanistan.\nThe British embassy driver, one of about 150 employees who applied to be evacuated in May, was at home with his family in a village on the outskirts of Kabul last Thursday when five masked men came to his house and attacked him, hitting him with their Kalashnikovs.\nThe attackers told him they had information he was still working for an international organisation. \u201cI told them I wasn\u2019t. They said: if we find out you are still working for those people, we will come back and kill you and your family,\u201d he said, speaking by telephone through an interpreter.\nThe driver, 44, who has asked for his name not to be printed, said his children, wife and neighbours saw the attack, and are now too afraid to leave their houses.\nX-rays showed his hand had been broken in two places and his skull fractured in three places. He said everyone in the village knew he had worked for the British embassy, and it was impossible to keep it secret. \u201cChildren ask each other what their fathers do. Why should they lie about it?\u201d he said.\nHe did not report the attack to the police, believing that the Taliban-run police would not have helped him.\nWhile he did not know the attackers, he suspected they were affiliated to the Taliban. Five years ago he had been targeted by Taliban militants because of his work with the British embassy, and was told he should leave his job. His son was hit in the head when a gun was fired during that attack, suffering brain damage.\n\n  Last month a pregnant Afghan policewoman was reported to have been killed by the Taliban, and there have been many other reports of attacks on people who worked for international organisations and the previous regime. Taliban officials have denied responsibility, citing the amnesty they announced for employees of the previous administration. It is not clear whether these attacks are officially organised and state sanctioned, or the work of fractured groups that know they can act with impunity.\nThe driver worked for the embassy for 10 years under a contract with G4S and then for 18 months in the same role employed by the Canadian security firm GardaWorld, which took over the embassy contract last year. He and about 150 colleagues applied to be evacuated in May under the UK Ministry of Defence\u2019s Afghan relocations and assistance policy, but his application was refused on the grounds that British embassy employees hired through subcontracted organisations were not eligible for help.\nThe Foreign Office reversed that position in August, announcing: \u201cWe will help all those Afghan security guards contracted through GardaWorld to protect the embassy. They will be granted the right to enter the UK and we are now working through the challenging logistics of getting them out of Kabul.\u201d However the evacuation process stopped before the guards could leave Afghanistan, with only one guard managing to make it to the UK.\nThe Foreign Office said: \u201cOur staff worked tirelessly to facilitate the swift evacuation of British nationals, Afghan staff and others at risk. We continue to make every effort to enable those eligible to come to the UK to come here.\u201d\nA GardaWorld source expressed regret at the news that a former member of staff had been attacked.\nAll the British embassy-contracted staff were dismissed in August when the embassy closed, and many are struggling financially. One former embassy guard, who was sacked in May after 12 years\u2019 service, said he and his family had been evicted from their home as they could not pay their rent. \u201cWe are passing the most difficult days of our lives both financially and mentally. Please pass on our concerns and difficulties to the relevant authorities and evacuate us before we further plunge into catastrophe,\u201d he wrote in an email.",

He became the council\u2019s chief monitoring officer in 1978 and, later, founder of the first legal practice led by black lawyers in Wales.\nWhen Tunji arrived in the UK in 1954 to study law in Cardiff, he was one of the few African students in the university\u2019s law school.\nA leading member of the UK\u2019s West African Students\u2019 Union, he spent weekends in London, and enjoyed listening to Ambrose Campbell and the West African Rhythm Brothers. He was called to the bar at Lincoln\u2019s Inn in 1967, and gained a master\u2019s from the London School of Economics in the same year, followed by further legal studies at University College London.\nTunji had intended to return to Nigeria with his family, but death threats and the Biafran war made this impossible. Instead, he held various appointments in local government, both in the UK and abroad, including service in the newly independent Zambia as a town clerk to one of the municipalities, and as a court officer until 1974 when he returned to Wales.\nAfter being appointed chief legal officer in Islwyn in 1974, Wales became his adopted home. Following local government reorganisation in 1996, Tunji established his own legal practice.\nA great humanist, Tunji was determined to use his skills to help others, including providing pro bono legal support both for complex immigration cases, and specialist advice for members of the Yoruba communities in the UK and beyond, and serving on the board of a London housing association that supported refugees.\nHe was founder and convener of the joint committee for ethnic minorities in Wales, and stood as a Labour candidate for the Welsh assembly in 2003 and 2007. In 2006, he was appointed MBE for services to the community in Wales and, three years later, he was granted freedom of the City of London.\nBorn in Abeokuta, Nigeria, to Saratu (nee Animashaun), a trader, and Hameed Atanda Mobolaji, an electrical and civil engineering contractor, Tunji attended Methodist boys high school in Lagos. It was in the city, in the late 1950s, that he met Viola Jumbo; they married in 1960 and went on to have four children. Tunji always carried Yoruba culture in his heart and had planned a final visit to Nigeria, feeling that the sacred odidere bird was calling him home.\nViola died in 2000 and one of his sons, Kayode (Ky), died in 2018. Tunji is survived by his other three children, Tina, Yinka and David, and his granddaughters, Katherine and Tolu.",

The instructions, laid down by government, are known as standard operating procedures, designed to ensure that animals are spared any avoidable pain or distress, including when they are being stunned or killed.\nFor killing on farm, a captive bolt gun is usedto despatch the animal instantly.\nPigs have a reputation for being heavy and boisterous and very difficult to restrain. This is part of the reason why farmers have been extremely reluctant to begin killing pigs on farms.\nA small number of pig carcasses could be burned in an incinerator, if the farm had access to one. However, people involved in dealing with dead animals \u2013 known as \u201cfallen stock\u201d \u2013 do not consider this likely, as incinerators require a lot of fuel to run, and could only deal with a few carcasses at a time.\nThe majority of pig carcasses are expected to be sent to Britain\u2019s rendering plants. There are six category 1 plants \u2013 the kind which would deal with pig carcasses \u2013 in Great Britain.\nThe practice of rendering animal by-products dates back to ancient times, when animal fat would be turned into tallow, from which soap and candles were made.\nNowadays, the rendering process involves reducing the size of the carcasses, before they are cooked and the fat and protein are separated, allowing them to be turned into a range of products\nBy-products from animals which are considered fit for human consumption find their way into items such as pet food, animal feed, fish feed and chemicals.\nHowever, the carcasses of any pigs killed on farm would not be inspected after slaughter, meaning they could not be assessed as being fit for human consumption. The carcasses from the current culling are therefore likely to be used only for products such as biodiesel.\nIt is against the law for dead animals to be buried or burned on farm, or for their carcasses to be left out to be eaten by certain types of birds. Burying or burning dead fallen stock is banned, because of the risk of disease being spread by contamination in the soil, in groundwater or through air pollution.\nDead animals are required to be collected by an approved transporter and taken for disposal at a certain number of locations, including a knacker\u2019s yard, an incinerator or a renderer.",

These claims were inevitably pounced on by the Israeli media.\nThat twist follows conflicting reports on the utility of the operation, with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 quoting the Mossad director, David Barnea, as initially saying that the mission was a \u201cfailure\u201d but later claiming it had been a success that he had asked Bennett to publicise.\nOther Israeli media suggested that the operation had achieved its aim in finding information about Arad, who sent three letters from captivity before Israel lost track of him. However, it remains unclear if the operation had solved the ultimate mystery of his fate.\nAmid the claims and counterclaims, Bennett\u2019s office later intervened to insist the operation had been a success.\n\u201cThe mission to obtain intelligence about Ron Arad was a successful one carried out while meeting exceptional operational objectives,\u201d a statement read.\n\u201cPresenting the information to Knesset members and the general public had value, expressing our great effort and commitment to the return of our sons home, even many years after they were captured by the enemy. Dissemination of any other information is a flat-out lie.\u201d\nThe existence of the cloak-and-dagger operation follows years of speculation over claims that he was moved to Iran before being returned to Lebanon before his supposed death.\nIntelligence reports have differed as to the circumstances and location of his death.\nIn 2016, a report in a Lebanese newspaper claimed that Arad had died in 1988 after being tortured to death in the town of Dhour Choueir, near Beirut.\nQuoting a witness who had been a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Movement \u2013 and whom it named only as Moufeed K \u2013 the Daily Star said the captive involved had been severely beaten and was found dead after being taken to a bathroom.\nIn 2004, however, an Israeli military commission suggested that Arad had died in the 1990s after being denied medical treatment for a serious illness and had been buried in Lebanon\u2019s Beqaa Valley. In 2008, a German negotiator, Gerhard Konrad, told Israel that Hezbollah said Arad died during a 1988 escape attempt.",

Sadly, it will probably add to voters\u2019 already\u00a0simmering resentment at the ability of the rich and powerful to live by a different set of rules from the rest of us.\nIn truth, lots has been done in recent years to clamp down on these activities. However, it is well past time that politicians acted decisively to end these tax\u00a0loopholes.\nBoris Johnson could use his majority in parliament today to lift the lid on opaque company structures. Legislation that would publicly name those who owned UK property through offshore companies has been gathering dust\u00a0since 2016.\nThe prime minister could instruct his officials to go after the lawyers, accountants and others who enable these schemes. He could properly fund HM Revenue and Customs to chase the tax dodgers. It\u00a0is\u00a0in his power to act.Robert Palmer Executive director, Tax Justice UK\n There is a magic money tree after all, but only for the super-rich who can avoid paying their fair share of taxation by ensuring that their assets are registered offshore beyond democratic control.\nThis is also true when a private equity firm buys a profitable company, as shareholders can claim\u00a0tax relief on their loans to buy the company. Once these loans are paid off, the company can be broken up by selling the most profitable parts to the highest\u00a0bidder.\nThis government\u2019s mantra of \u201ctaking back control\u201d does not embody the will of the people they have impoverished and burdened with increased taxation, but clearly means capital free from any democratic control whatsoever. Margaret Phelps Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan\n Even if it was without the secrecy, the reliance of political parties on rich donors would still be a problem for democracy (Tories facing calls to return cash from donors named in Pandora papers, 4 October).\nPopular and hugely beneficial policies, such as closing tax loopholes and shutting down tax havens, don\u2019t happen because parties literally cannot afford to lose the support of very rich people.\nThe solution is the state funding\u00a0of political parties, democratically allocated in proportion to votes received at the\u00a0most recent general\u00a0election.Richard Mountford Hildenborough, Kent\n A Tory MP\u2019s admission that London is \u201cthe money laundering capital of the world\u201d reminded me of the old-fashioned practice of \u201cblueing\u201d, whereby a small trace of blue iron salt, indigo or ultramarine was added to the wash\u00a0to give dingy\u00a0white fabrics a\u00a0whiter\u00a0and\u00a0brighter appearance. Christine Conlin Swynnerton Stone, Staffordshire\n The Blairs have only a walk-on part in the Pandora papers and, as you report, avoiding \u00a3300,000 of tax is not illegal (Tony and Cherie Blair bought property via offshore firm and saved \u00a3300,000 in tax, 3 October). However, given the tribute that Keir Starmer recently paid to the positive aspects of the New Labour years, those who will struggle to keep a roof over their heads this autumn after the universal credit cut may ask if Labour in 2021 really does stand for\u00a0the many rather than the few.Keith Flett Tottenham, London\n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

        "content": "The apparently unassailable Tory leader inspires meek tranquility at his party\u2019s conference\nThere is normally a prince over the water at Conservative conference, the alternative attraction members flock to see at fringes. For many years it was Boris Johnson, though Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss have contested for the crown.\nBut now, as one cabinet minister put it, it\u2019s all about \u201cKing Boris\u201d. Even among his MPs who remain deeply sceptical of his motives and his competence, there is an acknowledgment that his status in the party is untouchable and so far unimpeded by a petrol crisis, soaring energy bills, empty food shelves, a welfare cut and impending tax rises.\nAcross party fringes and at drinks receptions, there are displays of loyalty which can verge on the comic. When Truss was asked at a conference fringe event who her favourite foreign secretary from history was, she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cBoris Johnson,\u201d she said.\nAt a drinks reception on Tuesday evening, when the guests on stage had a gentle discussion about which rising star might have their eye on Number 10, the work and pensions secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey heckled from the back of the room: \u201cThere\u2019s no vacancy.\u201d\nOne backbench MP from the One Nation wing of the party claimed loyalty was the only means of advancement under Johnson \u2013 saying only those who \u201cbow to the King\u201d are promoted.\nJohnson has delighted in the display and joked to journalists on Monday evening that the lack of dissent must have made the conference hard to cover, offering to confect a row to spice up coverage.\nDespite the gloomy predictions about how chaos on the forecourt would overshadow his big conference moment, Johnson has bulldozed through the questions with a disciplined message on higher wages \u2013 no matter how many holes you can pick in the argument. \u201cIt\u2019s all going horribly right,\u201d he said of his conference week.\nThere is no better illustration of his total dominance than the room he has given to his cabinet ministers, a small white box seating just 600 where the hum of Tory activists buying scented candles from the exhibition hall sometimes drowns out their speeches. His own will be on a grand separate stage, built secretly in a separate arena space.\nBut even the most senior cabinet minister has had very little to say that would have suffered from being drowned out. The word that multiple cabinet ministers have been using to describe the conference \u2013 with a nod and a wink \u2013 is \u201clow key\u201d.\nEven the cabinet minister whose star is most in the ascendancy, Rishi Sunak, gave a conference speech that could have been delivered at a fringe event, with a modest announcement about a boost to jobs support.\nThe most eye-catching announcement, Priti Patel\u2019s inquiry into the murder of Sarah Everard and the culture of misogyny in the police, was more a consequence of an appalling circumstance than a calculated policy direction.\n\u201cYou would normally expect the chancellor to have a big rabbit to pull out of a hat, but the prime minister\u2019s emphasis has been on what we are delivering now,\u201d one cabinet minister shrugged, saying Downing Street had told them there was \u201cno pressure to make any announcements\u201d.\nA reshuffle has also helped avoid ministers being able to say anything too interesting. Those who have been in their new reshuffled briefs for a matter of weeks, such as Nadhim Zahawi, Oliver Dowden or Michael Gove, used their mere minutes on stage to tell their life story, fuel the culture wars or make gags at Labour\u2019s expense.\nThere are practical reasons, too. One senior minister said they thought it was \u201cgood to be focusing on delivery rather than new policy \u2026 we have enough on our plates \u2013 like where is the petrol?\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s speech on Wednesday will have precious little to add \u2013 apart from some rallying optimism and underlining his message on higher wages. It will coincide with the cut to universal credit \u2013 which campaigners and economists have warned will be devastating to the poorest \u2013 but which Johnson has repeatedly shrugged off in interviews with more soundbites on higher pay.\nHis speech is programmed to last a brisk 40 minutes, half the time of the Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s speech in Brighton a week earlier.\nAbove all there is a supreme sense of confidence in the party, among members and MPs. \u201cIt almost feels like a 2019 victory party which we never really got to have,\u201d one minister said.\nThat confidence has translated into a broad understanding that Johnson will not call an election until 2024. \u201cWe are definitely going long,\u201d one cabinet minister said. \u201cThe message you will hear over and over again over the next chapter is that we are fundamentally remaking the economy, we are changing Britain to a high pay, high skill country which has lagged behind for too long, and that is a generational project. That isn\u2019t compatible with a snap election \u2013 my guess is no earlier than 2024.\u201d\nThere are still a few Cassandras. One cabinet minister said they were more unnerved than some colleagues about the damage the autumn could inflict on the party\u2019s reputation for competence.\n\u201cMy view is that the public is still willing to blame the media or bad luck for what they are experiencing,\u201d said the minister. \u201cBut they want to see the government act, they want to see us get a grip. That\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary to land this message on pay. That\u2019s a message I fundamentally believe in, Boris believes in. But we\u2019ll see what the polls say in four or five weeks \u2013 I think that\u2019s the better time to make a judgment. I\u2019m quite concerned about complacency.\u201d",

But that opportunity was denied.\u201d\nBrown said when he went to fetch his pass from the collection point just outside the conference, he was initially told he needed an extra police check, before Stacey suddenly arrived.\n\u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re booked into the conference \u2013 what was it you wanted to do?\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, meet people, network, talk.\u2019\u201d\nStacey offered instead to give him access to \u201cany minister you want\u201d to discuss his campaign issues, an offer Brown said \u201cseemed a bit surreal\u201d.\nStill keen to go to the conference, Brown tried again to collect his pass, at which point Stacey again arrived, explaining that his offer of cooperation was dependent on Brown not going to the conference.\nEventually, Brown and Davidson were allowed in on Monday, but were constantly chaperoned by Stacey, who introduced them to attendees of his choice.\n\u201cIt was like when journalists go to China and they\u2019ve got a minder. I thought \u2013 is this for real?\u201d Brown said.\n\u201cMyles is a very nice chap, but we didn\u2019t get to do what we had come to do, which was meet up with our friends and be introduced to people. We were introduced to people Myles knew.\u201d\nDavidson asked if she could return on Tuesday, but was refused. An email to her from Stacey, seen by the Guardian, said she and Brown had been allowed in on Monday \u201cas day guests\u201d because there was capacity.\nIt added: \u201cWe will refund the payments you have each made for your passes. The passes you have won\u2019t work tomorrow or the day after.\u201d\nDavidson said that as well as the \u00a3225 spent on her pass, she had spent her own money on travel and five nights in a hotel, totalling many hundreds of pounds.\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. I\u2019m here to represent the community I serve. If there was a problem, why didn\u2019t they tell me when I applied for accreditation?\n\u201cHow can I go back to the organisation, and the people they\u2019re supporting, and tell them this?\u201d\nA Conservative party spokesperson said on Tuesday: \u201cWindrush Defenders Legal were able to attend Conservative party conference yesterday.\u201d\nThe party declined to say why the campaigners were not allowed into the conference independently, or whether they would be compensated for their other costs.\nThe Labour party spoke out in support of the campaigners later on Tuesday.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 treatment of the Windrush generation has been nothing short of dreadful, with a failing compensation scheme that has piled insult upon injustice.\n\u201cNow we hear that campaigners have been accredited for access to their party conference in advance and then denied entry without explanation.\n\u201cIt would be a disgrace if the campaigners have been turned away simply because the Tories are too ashamed to hear about their terrible record. The government must stop treating the Windrush generation so appallingly.\u201d",

        "content": "After countless hurdles and years of mounting expectations, Wallace has become the first Black Nascar driver to claim a checkered flag since Wendell Scott\u2019s Jacksonville win in 1963\nTo win in Nascar, it takes the right mix of skill and luck. At Talladega, it helps to have more of the latter.\nLike Daytona, Talladega is what\u2019s known as a superspeedway \u2013 the sport\u2019s biggest oval circuit, a banked, 2.66-mile strip in east-central Alabama that was once home to Air Force twin-engine fighters. For the better part of 500 miles Nascar\u2019s pilots wrestle to keep all four wheels planted while racing in giant packs that sometimes run four and five abreast. In these turbulent formations, emotions and tire temperatures run high. It doesn\u2019t take much \u2013 a momentary lapse in concentration, a betrayed alliance between pusher and pushee, a hot dog wrapper wafting in from the grandstand \u2013 to set off The Big One, the dreaded, accordion-style crash that shoots cars into the air, taking out the grid in chunks.\nAnd then on top of all that there\u2019s the weather. Persistent rain showers deferred the start of last week\u2019s Talladega Cup feature, the YellaWood 500, from Sunday and interrupted the race again after the green flag dropped on Monday. Add to that downpour the thundering stakes for the 12 pilots in Nascar\u2019s Cup \u201dChase\u201d \u2013 a 10-week, race-within-the-race to determine the drivers\u2019 championship \u2013 and what you have are powder-keg perfect conditions for not one but three Big Ones. The last came on lap 117 when the Chevrolet machine of Ryan Preece was shoved a bit too hard and turned into the outside backstretch barrier, triggering a four-car pileup just before the skies opened yet again.\nAs the yellow flag flew Bubba Wallace, who survived the initial wrecks and was just a few cars up from Preece before he was bumped out of line, led the field around in his No 23 Toyota machine and into the pits to duck the rain. But this time it didn\u2019t let up. And so Wallace was awarded his first Cup race from his pit box. He called it \u201ca huge weight lifted off my shoulders.\u201d But, likely, posterity will remember it by a different name: the perfect storm.\nAfter all, Wallace isn\u2019t just any driver. He is Nascar\u2019s Black driver, the third ever to land a fulltime drive in its top three series, its unofficial ambassador for diversity and inclusion \u2013 the guy who dared his sport to stop tolerating fans\u2019 confederate flag displays and got his wish. It was at this very track that Wallace reckoned with the full spectrum of consequences of that brave stand \u2013 from an FBI investigation into a noose-like garage door handle to what looked like the whole sport rallying around him in the wake of that hate-crime investigation to Donald Trump\u2019s White House essentially branding him a liar. That race was weather-delayed, too.\nNow here Wallace was, 15 months later \u2013 not just the first Black Nascar driver to claim a checkered flag since Wendell Scott\u2019s 1963 triumph in Jacksonville, but a Cup race winner for the first time in a car part-owned by Nascar rookie Michael Jordan. \u201cSome sleepless nights,\u201d Wallace said afterward, ticking off his mechanisms for dealing with the singular pressure of being Nascar\u2019s Charlie Pride and for pushing through his perfectionist streak. \u201cTalking to professionals to help me stay focused on the task at hand. But it\u2019s my family [and girlfriend Amanda] pushing me and knowing that as I\u2019m being the realistic, sometimes pessimistic person, they hold the optimism for me and help me show back up at the racetrack with a good mindset.\u201d\nOf course there are some who are crying foul on Wallace\u2019s diversity breakthrough, who see echoes of Danica Patrick\u2019s rain-delayed 2008 IndyCar victory at Motegi and Aric Almirola\u2019s rain-shortened 2014 Cup win at Daytona, who flock to social media to complain that the fix is in. But Wallace \u2013 who, it\u2019s worth reminding, was a multi-race winner in the truck series and an Xfinity series title fighter \u2013 isn\u2019t paying his detractors much mind this time. \u201cI\u2019ve been off the main pages for a handful of months now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped out a ton. I would go and read the comments. After a bad race I would become one of those haters that doesn\u2019t know anything. Just start telling myself a bunch of dark thoughts. It never helped anything.\u201d\nIf ever there was a time to doubt himself it was this season, which began with him joining 23XI\u2019s single-car team after four years racing for Richard Petty \u2013 Nascar\u2019s other Michael Jordan. And Jordan \u2013the other one, the one without a track record in the sport until this season \u2013 made no secret of his desire to succeed straight out of the box. And while 23XI has had no problem bringing Columbia Sportswear, DoorDash and other non-traditional sponsors into the sport, they\u2019ve mostly struggled to find consistency despite technical alliances with Toyota and Joe Gibbs Racing (a perennial frontrunner) and the technical leadership of 23XI co-owner and Joe Gibbs driver Denny Hamlin. Their maiden race at February\u2019s Daytona 500 \u2013 a frustrating, crash-marred affair that nearly saw Wallace miss the race entirely with car trouble \u2013 harkened memories of Dr J\u2019s doomed Nascar adventure. Excepting Monday\u2019s result and a redemptive second-place effort at Daytona in August, Wallace\u2019s average finishing position was 20th. That, he took personally.\nNow after all those hurdles, after years of mounting expectations, Wallace finally gets a moment to savor. He gets to revel in the fact that his maiden victory came on a track that was the pet project of former Alabama governor George Wallace, a noted racist. He gets to bask in an accomplishment that came two months after Scott\u2019s family finally got a trophy and victory lane celebration to show for Wendell\u2019s landmark win. He gets to tell his 23XI bosses that, indeed, the arrow is pointed up and that the Jordan and Hamlin-led franchise\u2014which will add a second car piloted by the former Cup champion Kurt Busch\u2014could very well have two cars in the title chase next season. And Wallace was already collaborating with Busch while running up front on Monday.\nBut most of all, he gets to stick it to his haters \u2013 the \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d with their thumbs ever poised to rain on his parade. \u201cI [decided] for good to get off the main pages there, go out and enjoy life, don\u2019t let people like that [in],\u201d he continued. \u201cIn high school I was always worried about what other people thought of me. I finally let that go once I graduated, matured a bit. I\u2019m not going to be able to please everybody. Doesn\u2019t matter if I won by a thousand laps or won a rain-shortened race. Not everybody is gonna be happy with it. That\u2019s OK because I know the one person that is happy, and that\u2019s because I\u2019m a winner and they\u2019re not.\u201d\nHad another driver won this week\u2019s Cup feature, it\u2019s a story but not a controversy. But because it\u2019s Wallace who came out on top, well, surely there must be some invisible hand in all this. That\u2019s the thing about Talladega. Sometimes it\u2019s a car that takes off at the track. Sometimes, it\u2019s a career. The difference comes down to making your own luck. For Wallace, that difference was historic.",

        "content": "Labour and SNP say investigation into \u2018failures\u2019 of Met police announced by home secretary lacks legal powers\nPriti Patel is facing demands from opposition politicians to announce a statutory inquiry into failings that allowed a serving Metropolitan police officer to kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard.\nAfter announcing that an investigation would examine why Wayne Couzens had not been identified by the force as a sexually aggressive predator, the home secretary was told by both Labour and SNP it would fall short because it would not have legal powers to compel witnesses to testify or disclose documents.\nCouzens was known among former colleagues as The Rapist and he had exposed himself on two occasions.\nAddressing the Conservative party conference, Patel said the killing \u201cexposed unimaginable failures in policing\u201d. She is yet to announce who will lead the non-statutory inquiry.\n\u201cIt is abhorrent that a serving police officer was able to abuse his position of power, authority and trust to commit such a horrific crime. The public have a right to know what systematic failures enabled his continued employment as a police officer. We need answers as to why this was allowed to happen,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI can confirm today that there will be an inquiry to give the independent oversight needed to ensure that something like this can never happen again.\u201d\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cLabour has been calling for a full independent inquiry for days. Now the home secretary has half-heartedly announced one, but not put it on a robust, statutory footing to ensure there are no barriers in the way to getting answers.\u201d\nThe SNP\u2019s justice and immigration secretary, Anne McLaughlin, said: \u201cRight now it is not set to be a statutory inquiry, and there must be a statutory inquiry.\u201d\nA source close to Patel said that a statutory inquiry would give Couzens the opportunity to apply to be a core participant in the inquiry, which would be wholly inappropriate. \u201cWe will start the process as a non-statutory inquiry and see where it goes,\u201d the source said.\nIn June, the chair of the inquiry into the unsolved murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, Baroness O\u2019Loan, said her inquiry was hampered and witnesses did not give evidence because it was not statutory.\n\u201cWe could not compel witnesses to testify, nor could we compel the Metropolitan police to disclose documents in a timely manner,\u201d she said.\nThe Labour peer Baroness Shami Chakrabarti has tabled an amendment to the police bill which would compel the home secretary to set up a statutory inquiry.\n\u201cIf we needed a judicial inquiry for racism in 1997, we certainly need as much for misogyny in 2021,\u201d she said.\nThe inquiry represents a change of direction for the government and will increase pressure on Cressida Dick, the Met police commissioner.\nBoris Johnson said on BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that there was no need for an inquiry.\nThe culture of the Met has been under scrutiny since it emerged that Couzens was known by colleagues to have a history of sexual aggression towards women. He was known as The Rapist while working at the Civil Nuclear constabulary in Kent by colleagues, who also knew he liked rape pornography.\nQuestions have been raised about the Met\u2019s vetting processes after it emerged Couzens was allowed to continue serving despite having been investigated by Kent police in 2015 for indecent exposure.\nHe used his warrant card and police-issued handcuffs to get Everard, 33, into a car before raping and strangling her and burning her body in woodland in Kent.\nThe first part of the inquiry would examine Couzens\u2019 previous behaviour and establish a definitive account of his conduct leading up to his conviction, as well as any opportunities missed, drawing on the ongoing Independent Office for Police Conduct investigations, a Home Office statement said.\nThe second part will look at specific issues raised by the first part, which could include vetting practices, professional standards and discipline, and workplace behaviour.\nLast week, it was revealed that five serving officers, including three from the Met, were under investigation for sharing racist and misogynistic messages with Couzens on a WhatsApp group.\nA freedom of information request showed that more than half of Met officers found guilty of sexual misconduct over a four-year period to 2020 kept their jobs, a total of 43 officers out of 83.\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, wrote to Patel on Friday with a request to work together to hold Dick and her force to account and to restore public trust, his office said. They spoke again on Sunday evening after it emerged that another Metropolitan police officer, PC David Carrick, had been charged with rape.\nKhan said the inquiry must address cultural issues within the force.\n\u201cAll police officers must adhere to the highest possible standards; we must stamp out misogyny, sexism, racism and homophobia, root out those who abuse their trusted position as officers,\u201d he said.\nPatel also plans to write to the independent police inspectorate to commission a thematic inspection, including police forces\u2019 ability to detect and deal with misogynistic and predatory behaviour. She has asked for initial findings by the end of 2021.\nDick, who was given a two-year extension to her contract last month, has rejected calls to resign over Everard\u2019s murder. On Monday she ordered a review of the Met\u2019s culture.\nIn a separate development, Johnson angered lawyers by claiming that the conduct of defence lawyers is responsible for the low level of rape convictions.\n\u201cThe defence is too often able to produce a spurious or otherwise reason why the defendant might have thought consent was given,\u201d he said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\nJonathan Black, a former president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors\u2019 Association, wrote on Twitter: \u201cDid I just hear @BorisJohnson on @BBCr4today blaming the delays in justice on defence seizing upon mobile phone evidence ? I flipping did.\u201d",

Wildman said he came to a consultative decision with his team. He was charged by the Liverpool County Football Association with bringing about the abandonment of a match and found guilty of the charge last week, a verdict he is appealing against. The player responsible for the abuse and his coach were also charged and found guilty.\nWildman says neither he nor his players received any support from the Liverpool County FA and that notice of his punishment was delivered via a message on the FA\u2019s online \u201cWhole Game System\u201d.\n\u201cI asked the FA to show common sense and I think they just need to admit they got this wrong,\u201d Wildman said. \u201cThe [FA] preach a mantra of zero tolerance and inclusion but what they\u2019re actually saying is that the most important issue is that you must play the game. Well, no actually. They put all these rainbow laces out, rainbow colours behind the badges, but the minute someone stands up to it they actively punish you for doing it.\u201d\nThe FA\u2019s guidelines on reporting discrimination make clear that any action against discriminatory behaviour during a match should be taken by the referee, who has the power to stop or abandon a game.

        "content": "Frances Haugen\u2019s animated remarks were a striking contrast to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s robotic testimony before Congress\nIt might, as one senator put it, be remembered as \u201cthe big tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth\u201d.\nThe truth-teller was former Facebook data scientist Frances Haugen, appearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to testify that the online platform knowingly harms children, just as cigarette makers did before they were brought to heel.\nThe whistleblower\u2019s inside knowledge and clear, crisp answers to senators\u2019 questions \u2013 with elaborate hand gestures for emphasis \u2013 was all the more damning because of her measured tone and lack of hyperbole.\n\u201cFacebook knows that they are leading young users to anorexia content,\u201d she said in a voice of authority that may prove a tipping point in government efforts to curb the power of big tech.\nShe was clearly preaching to the converted as senator after senator joined her in scathing criticism of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, for putting profits before people.\nZuckerberg was memorably played by Jesse Eisenberg (later the supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman) in the Aaron Sorkin-scripted film The Social Network. Should a sequel be made, the role of Haugen might go to a similarly top-notch actor like Reese Witherspoon.\nHaving burst into the public consciousness on the flagship 60 Minutes current affairs program on Sunday, Haugen passed a chorus of clicking cameras to enter the compact Senate committee room at 10.02am.\nThe 37-year-old sat down at a long table with a blue folder marked \u201cwhistleblower aid\u201d in gold letters. She unscrewed a green bottle of Mountain Valley water and took a sip. Above her hung a giant chandelier and ornately moulded ceiling and cornicing. Light shimmered off marble panels around the room. Haugen\u2019s face was beamed back to her from three giant TV screens. Her microphone came with a red digital countdown clock for each senator\u2019s questions.\nA former product manager on Facebook\u2019s civic misinformation team, she has come forward with tens of thousands of pages of internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in the company\u2019s civic integrity unit.\nThe impunity of Facebook, which has 2.8 billion users worldwide and nearly $1tn in market value, is a rare issue that unites Democrats and Republicans, so she was never likely to face a tough cross-examination.\nDemocrat Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Senate commerce subcommittee, gaveled the session in and argued that Facebook knows that its products are addictive, like cigarettes. \u201cTech now faces that big tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cOur children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror\u201d \u2013 but instead, he noted, Zuckerberg was going sailing.\nHaugen was a compelling witness. \u201cI joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am here today because I believe Facebook\u2019s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.\u201d\nShe described Facebook\u2019s lack of transparency and said it shows the need for congressional oversight. \u201cAlmost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside of Facebook. The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the US government and from governments around the world.\u201d\nThe hearing was taking place just a day after an extraordinary technical glitch put Facebook offline and, somewhat humiliatingly, forced it to communicate via Twitter.\nHaugen observed: \u201cYesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet. I don\u2019t know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn\u2019t used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies.\u201d\nShe agreed with the big tobacco analogy, noting that Facebook\u2019s own research into Instagram found children saying that it made them feel bad but they could not give it up and always craved the next click. She also warned that Facebook\u2019s engagement-based ranking system is \u201cfanning ethnic violence\u201d in Ethiopia and other countries.\nThe mood could hardly have been more different from when Zuckerberg himself has testified before Congress, offering robotic answers that exposed members\u2019 lack of digital savvy. Haugen observed: \u201cThere is no one currently holding Mark to account. The buck stops with Mark.\u201d\nShe argued that company should declare \u201cmoral bankruptcy\u201d if it wants to seek healing and reconciliation.\nHaugen\u2019s website says she was born in Iowa City, Iowa, the daughter of two professors and grew up attending the Iowa caucuses with her parents, \u201cinstilling a strong sense of pride in democracy and responsibility for civic participation\u201d.\nShe has a degree in computer engineering and a master\u2019s degree in business from Harvard. Before being recruited by Facebook in 2019, she worked for 15 years at tech companies including Google, Pinterest and Yelp.\nShe said: \u201cCongress can change the rules Facebook plays by and stop the harm it is causing. I came forward, at great personal risk, because I believe we still have time to act. But we must act now.\u201d\nAbout 30 aides, journalists and members of the public watched from two rows of seats behind Haugen and, as so often at such hearings, senators drifted in and out over the three hours. Senator Roger Wicker sought to reassure Haugen: \u201cYou see some vacant seats.

The plan is for the event to subsequently shift to Houston, base for more than 8,000 Chevron staff. Yet for now there is a bizarre lack of clarity, including over a move to later in spring after a deal was agreed for network television coverage. Chevron has agreed a six-year partnership.\n\u201cWe are working very, very hard with Chevron and the LPGA to find our future home and dates, likely in Houston, which by the way has an amazing track record in hosting and supporting world-class golf tournaments,\u201d said Ed McEnroe of IMG, which co-manages the tournament. \u201cSo, more to come on that in the coming months.\u201d\nPressed on the venue situation, McEnroe added: \u201cWe are taking our time on this. We have got to make the right decision and it\u2019s a collective decision. It\u2019s Chevron and the LPGA here. The golf course calibre has got to be major championship. It\u2019s got to work well for so many of those other things that we talked about, from weather to travel flow, network windows, what kind of experience can we create within that golf course, not just from an infrastructure standpoint but for volunteers and media and all fans.\n\u201cIf we are in Houston, the Chevron employee base is going to be important for us.\n\u201cSo bear with us. We are working hard but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to figure that through.\u201d\nThe good news comes in the form of a 60% increase in prize fund, to $5m (\u00a33.67m). Still, this is $800,000 less than the R&A paid out at this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Open and $500,000 short of this year\u2019s US Women\u2019s Open.\nThe PGA Tour\u2019s Houston Open found itself without a sponsor in 2018 and 2019. It has since moved from just before the Masters at the Golf Club of Houston to November at Memorial Park.",

I am just going to keep going on about my business and stay the same.\u201d\nWith her seeding of 17, Raducanu received a first-round bye and she awaits either the world No 71 Mar\u00eda Camila Osorio Serrano or Aliaksandra Sasnovich, who is ranked No 100, in the second round. Raducanu faces a potential third-round match with the 11th seed, Simona Halep, should both players win their opening tie.\nIndian Wells also marks Raducanu\u2019s first tournament since opting not to continue working with Andrew Richardson, who had temporarily coached her during the US hardcourt season. She is currently being helped by Jeremy Bates, the head of women\u2019s tennis at the LTA, and says she is confident she will handle herself well until she appoints a permanent coach. \u201cI know that even though I\u2019m quite young, I\u2019ve got a lot of experience banked,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end of the day you\u2019re out there on your own and you have to be your own coach on the court.\u201d\nThe enormous amount of popularity and attention Raducanu gained in New York has immediately led to appearances at events such as the Met Gala and the No Time To Die James Bond movie premiere, but she says that aside from the odd event, she has been focused on training since her time in New York.\n\u201cWhen I was at home I still didn\u2019t really go out,\u2019 she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to a restaurant or anything.

Another frontbencher said they were concerned about complacency, pointing out that the petrol shortage was still gripping their constituency.\nIn the US earlier this month, the prime minister insisted market forces would resolve petrol shortages, but within days of his return ministers had suspended competition laws in the energy sector and called in the army.\nJohnson and his top team have eschewed showy announcements at the four-day gathering in Manchester in favour of repeatedly hammering home the message that they are \u201cgetting on with the job\u201d of levelling up the UK.\nIn a nod to the concerns of southern Tories that levelling up is a hard sell in their constituencies, the prime minister will reframe it as a way of alleviating overcrowding.\nHe will claim the policy will \u201ctake the pressure off parts of the overheating south-east while simultaneously offering hope and opportunity to those areas that have felt left behind\u201d.\nBusiness groups have been irked by the government\u2019s insistence that it is up to the private sector to resolve the supply chain problems that have beset a string of industries.\nJames Martin, the director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusiness supports the government\u2019s ambition to move to a sustainably high-skilled, high-wage economy which does more to harness homegrown skills and talents, but this is a huge transition that will not happen overnight \u2026 Simply riding it out is not an option.\u201d\nBusiness groups pointed out that firms are facing massive increases in a number of upfront cost pressures, including raw materials and shipping, with an impending rise in national insurance contributions coming on top.\nMartin warned that prices would have to rise. \u201cGiven the strains that business is being placed under, it is almost inevitable that many will have to raise their prices to remain viable and our own data suggests that this process is already underway.\u201d\nJohnson played down fears about inflation on Tuesday, saying: \u201cPeople have been worrying about inflation for a very long time. I\u2019m looking at robust economic growth.\u201d\nInflation was running at 3% last month, and domestic energy prices are expected to continue rising sharply in the coming months. Cash-strapped consumers are also about to be hit by the \u00a320 a week cut in universal credit and the 1p increase in national insurance contributions.\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Union vice-president, Tom Bradshaw, said: \u201cFarm businesses have done all they can to recruit staff domestically, but even increasingly competitive wages have had little impact because the labour pool is so limited \u2013 instead only adding to growing production costs. A solution to this crisis will need the right people with the right skills and training available in rural areas where many roles are based.\u201d\nHe called for a short-term Covid recovery visa, alongside a permanent seasonal workers scheme, which would give farmers time to invest in the skills and recruitment of a domestic workforce.\nTony Danker, the director general of the CBI, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe\u2019ve got labour shortages, high gas prices, supply chain pressures, we need government and business working together to solve this. The idea that one side alone can solve what is a pretty significantly stressful moment for the global economy, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful.\u201d\nThe latest official figures showed average earnings increasing by 6.8% in the year to July; but the Office for National Statistics warned that \u201cinterpretation should be taken with caution,\u201d because the growth partly reflects workers returning from furlough.",

It probably had a body size similar to that of a modern-day chicken, but with its tail taking it to about a metre-long.\nStephan Spiekman, a research fellow at the Natural History Museum, said: \u201cPendraig milnerae lived near the beginning of the evolution of the meat-eating dinosaurs. It\u2019s clear from the bones we have that it was a meat-eater, but early in the evolution of this group these animals were quite small, in contrast to the very famous meat-eating dinosaurs like T rex which evolved much later.\u201d\nSpiekman and his colleagues gave it the name dragon chief to honour its probable position as the apex predator. The reference to Milner, who died in August, was apt as she played a vital role in relocating the specimen, as well as contributing significantly to the understanding of theropod dinosaurs.\nThe discovery of this new species could also provide evidence for potential island dwarfism. Spiekman said: \u201cThe area where these specimens were found was most likely an island during the time period in which it lived. Species which live on islands often tend to become smaller than those on the mainland in a phenomenon called island dwarfism.\u201d\nHe said that because Pendraig was not fully grown, it was not possible to reach conclusions on this. \u201cWe need more evidence from more species to investigate the potential for island dwarfism in this area during that time, but if we could prove it, it would be the earliest known occurrence of this evolutionary phenomenon.\u201d\nRichard Butler, co-author on a paper on the dinosaur and professor of palaeobiology at the University of Birmingham, said: \u201cDinosaur discoveries are really rare in Wales, and this is only the third dinosaur species known from the country. It\u2019s very exciting to learn more about the dinosaurs that lived here in the UK during the Triassic, right at the dawn of dinosaur evolution.\u201d\nThe remains were found in the 50s by the palaeontologists Pamela Robinson and Kenneth Kermack. They were studied, but the creature was not named.\nSusannah Maidment, a senior researcher in paleobiology at the Natural History Museum, was trying to track the specimen down and turned to Milner for help. \u201cShe went away and about three hours later she had it. She found it in a drawer with crocodile material.\u201d",

There is no medicinal benefit to Kambo, according to the TGA, and it can be lethal.\nThe TGA has listed it as a schedule 10 poison, in the category for \u201csubstances of such danger to health as to warrant prohibition of sale, supply and use\u201d.\nIt noted that Australians have adopted Kambo rituals from traditional indigenous ceremonies in South America.\n\u201cThere were reports of deaths arising from use of Kambo in ceremonies, and therefore it was declared not safe for human use,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\u201cUse of Kambo typically forms part of a ritualistic ceremony, involving burning of the participant\u2019s skin followed by direct application of the substance to the burned regions,\u201d the spokesperson noted, adding there had been \u201crare\u201d deaths, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, liver damage, stomach pain and other adverse effects.\nThere is no evidence of any medical benefit from Kambo, the TGA found.\nNew South Wales police investigated the death of a local woman after she suffered a cardiac arrest during a Kambo ceremony in 2019. Australian practitioners are listed on international \u201caccreditation\u201d sites and can be found easily online.\nGuardian Australia has seen users claim, without evidence, that it is a natural antibiotic and that a \u201ccleanse\u201d with frog poison can strengthen and heal the mind. Some promote it as a \u201cvaccine\u201d. Videos of the ceremony often include vision of people vomiting afterwards.\nIn its submission, the Australian Medical Association supported the ban, saying it considered Kambo to be a \u201csignificant health risk\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cIn addition to its harmful effects both intended and adverse, the act of blistering the skin and applying Kambo to the burnt area risks other health concerns such as infection,\u201d the AMA\u2019s submission said.\n\u201cThere is also a risk that using Kambo would prevent a patient from seeing a medical practitioner for their medical condition and delay diagnosis.\u201d\nThe South Australian health and community services complaints commissioner, associate professor Grant Davies, issued prohibition orders in 2019 against an Australian couple trading as Two Wolves \u2013 One Body for offering Kambo services.\nDavies said their advice was that the substance was \u201cvery dangerous to humans\u201d, and that he hoped the TGA ban would make people aware of the danger.\n\u201cAt a time when people are more aware of the significance of good healthcare to their overall wellbeing, burning holes into your skin and scraping a poisonous frog secretion into the wound to induce a \u2018cleanse\u2019 is dangerous,\u201d he said.\nWhile practitioners claim the frog is not harmed when Kambo is harvested, it must be stressed before it secretes the toxic mucus. This is done by stretching the frog or by putting it near a fire.\n This article and its subheading were amended on 8 October 2021 to remove references to \u201cfrog venom\u201d and \u201cvenomous secretions\u201d.

Charisteas argued that Walter\u2019s undisclosed communication with the barrister Gillian Anderson, who represented Ms Charisteas, gave rise to an apprehension of bias. There was no suggestion of actual bias and Mr Charisteas had been seeking a retrial.\nMr Charisteas appealed to the high court, which handed down its ruling on Wednesday. It granted the appeal, and set aside the orders of the full court of the family court made last year.\nThe Charisteas have been involved in family law proceedings for almost 15 years.\nIn submissions to the high court, Mr Charisteas says that despite a recusal application having previously been made against Walters, the judge failed to declare a relationship with Anderson.\nThe court heard that between 22 March 2016, when the Charisteas\u2019 trial was listed before Walters, and 12 February 2018, when Walters delivered his decision in the case, the judge and Anderson met for a drink or coffee about four times, exchanged numerous text messages, and spoke on the phone on at least five occasions, according to Anderson\u2019s evidence. Walters retired three days after handing down the Charisteas decision. The outcome was largely favourable to Ms Charisteas.\nAnderson disclosed the relationship after lawyers for Mr Charisteas asked her about gossip in Perth legal circles. She denied the relationship was intimate, and said that she had not discussed the \u201csubstance\u201d of the case with Walters.\nAccording to the ruling of high court chief justice, Susan Kiefel, and four other judges, it was clear there were no exceptional circumstances that warranted the communications taking place, and that it would be unlikely the opposing side would have allowed them to occur, even if they had been disclosed.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe court found that a fair-minded observer would reasonably apprehend that Walters might not bring an impartial mind to resolving aspects of the case because of the communications.\n\u201cThe lack of disclosure in this case is particularly troubling.\n\u201cIt is difficult to comprehend how the trial judge could have failed to appreciate the need to disclose the communications, particularly when he was dealing with the application to recuse himself on other grounds.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe court found that in several instances the reasoning of the full court of the family court in dismissing the application was erroneous. It was incorrect to conclude that an observer would accept that Walters and Anderson had adhered to \u201cprofessional restraint\u201d in their communications, or would accept that Walters may have mistakenly felt he did not need to disclose the communications, but that this failure was not sinister.\nThe Australian Law Reform Commission is reviewing the laws in relation to judicial impartiality as a result of the case.\nIts inquiry is examining whether the law about actual or apprehended bias relating to judicial decision-making \u201cis appropriate and sufficient to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice\u201d and whether it provides clarity to decision-makers, the legal profession and the community.\nIts final report is due in December.",

The revelation Elliot has a British Virgin Islands-based company \u2013 which he owns with Ben Goldsmith, the brother of the Tory peer and minister Zac \u2013 will raise fresh questions for the businessman, whose courting of ultra-wealthy but controversial political donors has already provoked widespread criticism.\nOn Monday, the Pandora papers \u2013 the largest leak of offshore data in history, which has been shared with the Guardian and other media by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists \u2013 helped expose how a series of substantial Conservative party funders are facing a range of allegations about their links to offshore finance. Today, the same leak shines a light on a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company Elliot and Goldsmith created to fund the making of Fire in Babylon, the pair\u2019s 2010 documentary film about the great West Indies cricket team of the 1970s and 80s. Analysis of financial disclosures suggests the duo\u2019s BVI company held a controlling stake in a British subsidiary that made the film. The UK company received a \u00a3600,000 loan from its BVI parent in 2008, plus \u00a3121,000 from a government scheme designed to incentivise film production in the UK between 2009 and 2011. The film made a small loss, and without the tax credits the subsidiary would not have been able to fully repay its offshore creditors, the largest of which was Elliot\u2019s and Goldsmith\u2019s BVI company, which had loaned the UK business most of its funds.\nWhile the arrangement does not appear to have breached any tax regulations or laws, it does raise questions about whether government film schemes should be helping to fund projects that are controlled in a tax haven. If Fire in Babylon had become profitable, then the structure might also have provided some tax advantages. Neither Elliot nor Goldsmith answered the Guardian\u2019s questions about whether any loan interest was paid by the UK production company to their offshore company, nor why the pair\u2019s names were initially kept off publicly available Companies House filings, which would have shown how they had a controlling stake in the UK production company via their BVI company. The connection only formally emerged in 2016, when Elliot and Goldsmith were registered as \u201cpersons of significant control\u201d of the UK firm, WIB Productions Ltd, which made the film. They said the idea they \u201cmight have attempted to conceal our involvement in the making or financing of Fire in Babylon is patently absurd, given our names were all over it from the start, in the credits, on the invitations, in newspaper and radio interviews and so on\u201d. Goldsmith added: \u201cIt is a love letter to one of the great sporting stories of all time.\u201d\nHere are responses, some of them edited, received from three offshore services providers \u2013 Alcogal, Asiaciti Trust and Fidelity \u2013 whose information appears in the Pandora Papers, and who were invited by the Guardian to comment on their activities and those of their clients.\nLevel up north \u2013 Michael Gove, the new levelling up secretary, will instruct his department to boost homebuilding in the north of England, after concerns among Tories that existing proposals targeted the south. It is understood Gove will drop the \u201czonal\u201d approach \u2013 which left local people unable to reject housing in areas designated for development \u2013 and overhaul the mandatory housebuilding targets that alarmed southern Tories. Separately, Dr Patrick Roach, the UK\u2019s most senior black union leader, has said the levelling-up agenda must not be \u201ccolour-blind\u201d or it will leave black workers behind. He called on the government to make employers much more transparent and accountable for things like addressing racism at work and ethnicity pay gaps. Boris Johnson will brush off petrol queues and empty shelves as evidence of a \u201cchange of direction\u201d towards a high-wage economy, as he closes a Conservative conference at which supply shortages have barely been acknowledged.\nBrexit fishing power play \u2013 The EU could cut Jersey and Britain\u2019s electricity supply over the UK\u2019s failure to provide sufficient fishing licences to the French, says France\u2019s EU affairs minister, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune. \u201cEnough already, we have an agreement negotiated by France, by Michel Barnier, and it should be applied 100%. It isn\u2019t being. In the next few days \u2026 we will take measures at the European level or nationally to apply pressure on the United Kingdom.\u201d The UK partly relies on electricity from France. Under the post-Brexit agreement struck on Christmas Eve, the EU can take measures \u201cproportionate to the alleged failure by the respondent party\u201d. That could be extended to the energy supply to the rest of the UK, but would need to be proportional and agreed to by other member states.\nBook thrown \u2013 Facebook puts \u201castronomical profits before people\u201d, harms children and is destabilising democracies, the whistleblower Frances Haugen has told the US Congress. The former employee said Facebook knew it steered young users towards damaging content and its Instagram app was \u201clike cigarettes\u201d for under-18s.\nHaugen is a former Facebook employee with 15 years in the industry as an expert in algorithms and design. She offered suggestions including changing newsfeeds to be chronological rather than algorithmic, appointing a government body for tech oversight, and requiring more transparency on internal research. Her testimony puts pressure on US lawmakers to take action after years of hearings and circular discussions about big tech\u2019s growing power.\n\u2018Stop diabetes in its tracks\u2019 \u2013 So many Britons are obese that almost one in 10 in the UK will have diabetes by 2030 amid alarming levels of obesity, putting millions at risk of \u201cdevastating complications\u201d including heart attacks, kidney failure, stroke, amputation and blindness, says Diabetes UK. The charity is calling for urgent action \u201cto stop it in its tracks\u201d including enrolling more people in the NHS diabetes prevention programme, greater access to weight loss programmes, and assurances that people with diabetes will get regular NHS checks to cut the risk of complications. Diabetes UK is launching a new TV campaign, This is Diabetes, featuring families across the UK living with the condition.\nWe all need a few more zeroes \u2026 Tina Turner has sold the rights to her music catalogue spanning six decades, including hits such as What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It, and Private Dancer, to the music publishing company BMG.\nThe \u201cqueen of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d sold her artist\u2019s and writer\u2019s shares of her recordings, as well as the management of her name, image and likeness, in the largest deal struck with a single artist in BMG\u2019s history. The sums involved were not disclosed. Turner, 81, will continue to be a recording artist on Warner Music\u2019s books.\nWith queues outside petrol stations and claims selfish punters are using jerry cans to stockpile fuel, one word has become synonymous with the supply chain crisis that has hit the UK in recent weeks: panic. But the social psychologist Clifford Stott says something different is going on.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2021/10/05-77480-TIF_panicbuying.mp3\nThe case of Meng Wanzhou poisoned Beijing\u2019s relations with Washington and Ottawa. Now the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei hopes the obvious bargain to release her in return for two Canadians may start a mending of the ways. Huawei is one of more than 300 Chinese companies kept on a banned entity list in the US, which claims the firm is capable or has used its equipment to spy on behalf of the Chinese state. Patrick Wintour writes that it seems unlikely that the aggressive atmosphere in Washington towards Huawei will ease.\nEngland\u2019s Ashes tour of Australia took a significant step towards being confirmed later this week following positive talks between players\u2019 representatives, the ECB, Cricket Australia and the Australian government. Barcelona ripped Arsenal apart in style to kickstart their Women\u2019s Champions League defence with a 4-1 win at the Johan Cruyff Stadium. Emma Raducanu says she will endeavour to continue working in exactly the same manner as before her shock US Open victory last month as she adjusts to the increased attention and her transformed status.\nA fifth of UK adults have increased their following of women\u2019s sport during the pandemic, research has found, with many citing the rise in coverage as a reason for their greater interest. News of a welcome and substantial boost in prize money for the first women\u2019s major of the golfing year has arrived with the not inconsequential footnote of no host venue being in place after 2022. Twenty-five men who claim they are victims of historical sexual abuse at Celtic Boys Club have launched group proceedings against Celtic Football Club. And a youth football coach has called for \u201ccommon sense\u201d after he was fined and suspended for leading his team off the pitch when they were exposed to homophobic abuse.\nAsian shares have slipped, defying a Wall Street rally where technology companies and banks erased most of the losses from the previous day\u2019s sell-off. Trading was closed in Shanghai for the Chinese national holidays. Futures trading puts the FTSE 40-50 points down ahead of its open. The pound is worth $1.360 and \u20ac1.174 at time of writing.\nThe Guardian\u2019s lead today is \u201cPandora papers: Tory co-chairs firm indirectly benefited from \u00a3121k tax credits\u201d. The Daily Mail has \u201cFrench threat to sink Xmas\u201d saying there is the threat of a \u201cCalais blockade\u201d in response to the fishing row. The i\u2019s lead is \u201cCovid vaccine mandatory for frontline NHS workers in Javid plan\u201d.\nNow for pretty much all the others \u2026 \u201cPM: I\u2019ve got the guts to make us a high-wage country\u201d says the Telegraph and the Express naturally laps that line up too: \u201cBoris: we\u2019ve got the guts to fix Britain\u201d. The Metro, though, sees it as an abrogation \u2013 \u201cCan he fix it? No he can\u2019t\u201d with the PM shown clambering out of a little earthmoving machine. The Mirror is more scathing: \u201cNo alternative \u2026 no heart\u201d as Johnson \u201crepeats idol Thatcher\u2019s lies to say he must snatch back \u00a320 a week from hard-up families today\u201d.\nThe Financial Times says \u201cJohnson steps up battle with business over immigration\u201d and the Times looks ahead in time: \u201cPM to reveal minimum wage rise in a few weeks\u201d.\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

But  the city\u2019s real pleasures are found in the urban-rural tension that you come across on this 78-mile route\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIt\u2019s Friday night on the Greenway path just outside the Olympic Park in east London. The last band of orange sky hangs lightly over the sleeping stadiums. Enough people linger in the gloom for the instincts to quicken. Far from the flash of trendier bits of town, a topless man dances solo to beats from his phone. An old lady wheezes between cigarettes, and a couple canoodle on a park bench.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nI wouldn\u2019t normally come here, particularly at this hour, but I\u2019ve given myself two and half days to walk the Capital Ring, a 78-mile pedestrian lap of London (click here for TfL map). I check my map to gauge progress just as a bike goes by, blaring hip-hop from a hidden speaker. Some kids join in the refrain and I do too, if only to myself.\nThe bushes fall away to the right and a magnificent building appears. It is municipal \u2013 somehow obviously so \u2013 but also boastful in that way Victorian civic buildings are; somewhere between an imperial train station and an Andalusian cathedral. The tingle of danger dissolves under the lamplight. I breathe out. \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I think.\nLater, I Google the building and discover it is actually Abbey Mills pumping station. Ah. That explains why this long path I\u2019m on is so straight: I\u2019m proceeding along the Northern Outfall sewer, a tube that funnels millions of litres of cockney effluent towards the Thames.\nI grew up in a steep, green valley in Devon before moving to London nine years ago. Soon after arriving, some atavistic urge for wildness drove me to walk as far as I could along east London\u2019s River Lea. After the herons and longboats of Walthamstow Wetlands, I saw some Coptic Christians in white robes doing full-immersion baptisms in waters officially designated ecologically \u201cbad\u201d by an EU directive. Each emerged from the murk smiling widely before dashing behind a bush to strip bare. A little further brought me to some scrubby woodland by the North Circular where some tents were strewn amid bonfire barrels and the air screamed with rubber. Finally, I reached Epping Forest with its great hallways of oak, hornbeam and holly.\n\u201cNice walk?\u201d my housemate asked when I got back. The components of a nice walk used to be obvious to me: fresh air, a body of water, woods, inclines, horizons. My Lea walk was materially different. \u201cWell,\u201d I began, before realising I had no idea how to reply. The feeling has remained. Beyond its landmarks, London \u2013 vast, stinking, dancing, decaying, beautiful London \u2013 defies easy categorisation.\nIn Wanderlust, Rebecca Solnit extols the virtues of city walking. While the country version is accepted as unquestionably good for the soul, she says, there are reasons certain thinkers and poets preferred urban strolls. Kierkegaard, Rousseau, Ginsberg needed for inspiration a ready supply of new experiences and unmediated interactions. US poet Frank O\u2019Hara even wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there\u2019s a subway handy or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life \u2026 The clouds get enough attention as it is.\u201d\nThe core of modern London, with its cafes and statues and fascinating folk, would sate any descendent of O\u2019Hara. Beyond the central tourist spots, though, there might be even more stimulation. In the sprawl, as the distinction between urban and rural blurs, clarity bends the knee to impression.\nAccording to one UN definition, anywhere with at least 20% tree coverage can be called a forest; London apparently has 21%. While trying to cross any road in one of the most congested cities in Europe, the idea of London as a forest feels at best trite semantics, at worst plain misleading. But walk the Capital Ring, which threads through the untrendy outlands and hops from common to copse to river basin, and the idea gains currency. Of course this is not the forest of naturalist homily, of campfires and marshmallows. It\u2019s different, but everywhere there is a whiff of the wild. Stags hold councils on misty hills, not a minute\u2019s walk from an A-road. Gangling trees fight developers in cracked pavements, sending scouts into every nook.\nIn his memoir The Tree, the novelist John Fowles wrote of needing to plunge into woodland. He was convinced that in the external world, wild nature was the closest reflection of the chaos of consciousness. Immersion fed his creativity. Walking in London\u2019s outlands, where order cedes to entropy, I did start to wonder if he would have thought this more nourishingly chaotic still.\nIt all means that a considered judgment of the Capital Ring is not straightforward. Every time I thought I had made my mind up, the scene changed. In one 15-minute period, I greeted families tending sunflowers in West Norwood, saw a drug deal in a playground, and watched parakeets cavort with crows in ancient oaks. Over two and a half days, the route took me through heath, pasture and dockland; it led me down boulevards in Wimbledon where the houses look down from great heights and across estates in Brent where the terraces crouch and gossip; it squeezed me through the Woolwich tunnel and thrust me out on the plains of Richmond Park.\nThe pleasure was in the juxtaposition, in the frothing urban-rural tension. In Beckton, I saw a man fishing for sea bass bothered neither by a plane gunning its engines 100 metres from him on the other side of the Royal Albert Dock nor the view to his right, the gleaming Emerald City of Canary Wharf. In Eltham, as I edged around a park being used for archery, two middle-aged men in Crystal Palace shirts were picking damsons in the scrub, scowling at the sourness. Sitting on the lush grass of Barn Hill in Fryent Country Park, my friend Mousa explained why so many of his mates live nearby: it\u2019s the only place you can get proper Iraqi falafel and kebabs.\nPeople like to call London a melting pot; it\u2019s entirely the wrong phrase. It suggests a sort of dreary sludge, of colours cancelling each other out. The city\u2019s various components \u2013 people, culture, nature \u2013 may mix but they remain discrete and unmelted, resisting homogeneity fiercely or extravagantly or dourly. I\u2019ve realised that walking is the best way to experience it all. Taking the tube might be quick, but it denies the senses London\u2019s staggering variety and conjunction, its record shops and its clouds.\nA couple of months ago, I walked a lap of the steep, green valley I grew up in. It was uncomplicatedly lovely. The sun was out, and I could see the sea, sparkling and fresh. London is different. The parks are huge and wild, the Thames majestic, the old buildings steepling and glamorous. But its loveliness is complicated.",

        "content": "Trillions of dollars a year are \u2018adding fuel to the fire\u2019 of the climate crisis, experts say\nThe fossil fuel industry benefits from subsidies of $11m every minute, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund.\nThe IMF found the production and burning of coal, oil and gas was subsidised by $5.9tn in 2020, with not a single country pricing all its fuels sufficiently to reflect their full supply and environmental costs. Experts said the subsidies were \u201cadding fuel to the fire\u201d of the climate crisis, at a time when rapid reductions in carbon emissions were urgently needed.\nExplicit subsidies that cut fuel prices accounted for 8% of the total and tax breaks another 6%. The biggest factors were failing to make polluters pay for the deaths and poor health caused by air pollution (42%) and for the heatwaves and other impacts of global heating (29%).\nSetting fossil fuel prices that reflect their true cost would cut global CO2 emissions by over a third, the IMF analysts said. This would be a big step towards meeting the internationally agreed 1.5C target. Keeping this target within reach is a key goal of the UN Cop26 climate summit in November.\nAgreeing rules for carbon markets, which enable the proper pricing of pollution, is another Cop26 goal. \u201cFossil fuel price reform could not be timelier,\u201d the IMF researchers said. The ending of fossil fuel subsidies would also prevent nearly a million deaths a year from dirty air and raise trillions of dollars for governments, they said.\n\u201cThere would be enormous benefits from reform, so there\u2019s an enormous amount at stake,\u201d said Ian Parry, the lead author of the IMF report. \u201cSome countries are reluctant to raise energy prices because they think it will harm the poor. But holding down fossil fuel prices is a highly inefficient way to help the poor, because most of the benefits accrue to wealthier households. It would be better to target resources towards helping poor and vulnerable people directly.\u201d\nWith 50 countries committed to net zero emissions by mid-century and more than 60 carbon pricing schemes around the world, there are some encouraging signs, Parry said: \u201cBut we\u2019re still just scratching the surface really, and there\u2019s an awful long way to go.\u201d\nThe G20 agreed in 2009 to phase out \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidies and in 2016, the G7 set a deadline of 2025, but little progress has been made. In July, a report showed that the G20 countries had subsidised fossil fuels by trillions of dollars since 2015, the year the Paris climate deal was reached.\n\u201cTo stabilise global temperatures we must urgently move away from fossil fuels instead of adding fuel to the fire,\u201d said Mike Coffin, senior analyst at the thinktank Carbon Tracker. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that governments stop propping up an industry that is in decline, and look to accelerate the low-carbon energy transition, and our future, instead.\n\u201cAs host of Cop26, the UK government could play an important global leadership role by ending all subsidies for fossil fuels, as well as halting new North Sea licensing rounds,\u201d he said. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in May that the development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year to meet climate goals.\nThe comprehensive IMF report found that prices were at least 50% below their true costs for 99% of coal, 52% of diesel and 47% of natural gas in 2020. Five countries were responsible for two-thirds of the subsidies: China, the US, Russia, India and Japan. Without action, subsidies will rise to $6.4tn in 2025, the IMF said.\nProper pricing for fossil fuels would cut emissions by, for example, encouraging electricity generators to switch from coal to renewable energy and making electric cars an even cheaper option for motorists. International cooperation is important, Parry said, to allay fears that countries could lose competitiveness if their fossil fuel prices were higher.\n\u201cThe IMF report is a sobering reading, pointing to one of the major defects of the global economy,\u201d said Maria Pastukhova, at the thinktank e3g. \u201cThe IEA\u2019s net-zero roadmap projects that $5tn is necessary by 2030 to put the world on the pathway to a climate-safe world. It is maddening to realise the much-needed change could start happening now, if not for governments\u2019 entanglement with the fossil fuels industry in so many major economies.\u201d\n\u201cFossil fuel subsidies have been a major stumbling block in the G20 process for years,\u201d she said. \u201cNow all eyes are on the G20 leaders\u2019 summit in late October.\u201d\nIpek Gen\u00e7s\u00fc, at the Overseas Development Institute, said: \u201c[Subsidy reform] requires support for vulnerable consumers who will be impacted by rising costs, as well for workers in industries which simply have to shut down. It also requires information campaigns, showing how the savings will be redistributed to society in the form of healthcare, education and other social services. Many people oppose subsidy reform because they see it solely as governments taking something away, and not giving back.\u201d\nThe G20 countries emit almost 80% of global greenhouse gases. More than 600 global companies in the We Mean Business coalition, including Unilever, Ikea, Aviva, Siemens and Volvo Cars, recently urged G20 leaders to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025.",

        "content": "Academic\u2019s appointment marks historic moment for Arab world but comes amid political and economic crisis, with some fearing she will be Kais Saied\u2019s pawn \nSara Medini, political analyst at the Tunisian feminist organisation Aswat Nissa, was in a meeting at work last week when she happened to glance at a news alert on her phone. What she saw left her at first flabbergasted, then delighted.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I thought I had misread it,\u201d she said. \u201cI told my colleagues: \u2018He\u2019s appointed a woman! He\u2019s appointed a woman!\u2019\n\u201cWe were all delighted. We had goosebumps. It\u2019s really a historic moment \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean they have a blank cheque.\u201d\nThe decision by the president, Kais Saied, to name Najla Bouden, a senior civil servant in the higher education ministry and lecturer in geological engineering, as the first female prime minister of Tunisia, or indeed of any Arab country, made waves around the world.\nAt home, it was greeted with a mixture of emotions \u2013 not least relief by those who hope it is a step on the road back to normality after Saied\u2019s shock move in July to sack his prime minister and suspend parliament in what many saw as a coup.\nThe jury is out, however, on what Bouden\u2019s appointment will mean for Tunisian women.\n\u201cThe fact that a woman has been appointed is excellent; it\u2019s a step forward [and] it breaks with stereotype. But it\u2019s not sufficient. The political programme of the government \u2013 her government \u2013 must follow egalitarian principles,\u201d said Medini.\n\u201cShe comes in at an incredibly critical moment. She has a lot of work to do.\u201d\nFor decades Tunisia has been considered a standard-bearer for women\u2019s rights in the Arab world, with a package of family laws \u2013 passed just months after independence in 1956 \u2013 abolishing polygamy and allowing women to file for divorce.\nWomen won the right to vote in 1957 and were able to run for office by 1959. In 2011, when the country led the first revolution of the so-called Arab spring, toppling the dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, women were on the barricades.\nBut some feel that progress towards full equality has stalled. Saied is against reforming laws to grant women equal inheritance rights, something the late president Beji Caid Essebsi said he would do \u2013 to the outrage of conservatives and religious figures.\nThere have been legislative victories since the revolution, notably a 2017 law aimed at cracking down on violence against women. But Medini said there was still a huge amount of work to be done \u201con a practical level\u201d to ensure the changes were implemented.\nOn top of all this, Tunisia\u2019s severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, has hit women disproportionately hard. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2020 gender inequality index, Tunisia dropped from 90th to 124th between 2006 and 2020.\n\u201c[The crisis] has accentuated women\u2019s economic weakness and thus accentuated their dependence on their families, on their husbands,\u201d said Medini.\n\u201cFor example, a woman [who] is the victim of violence at the hands of her husband can\u2019t escape the home or ask for a divorce, because she hasn\u2019t the necessary money.\u201d\nFor Halima Ouanada, an academic at the University of Tunis El Manar, some of the reactions last week to Bouden\u2019s appointment were proof of the challenges still facing women in power.\n\u201cRather than dwelling on her role as university professor, on her good international reputation as an academic, following more than 13 years of experience in the management of large-scale projects, the debate turned into reflections on her gender: the price of her shoes, her glasses,\u201d Ouanada wrote in Le Temps News\n\u201cShe was presented as the daughter of so-and-so and the wife of so-and-so \u2026 as if she owed nothing to herself, to her intelligence and perseverance.\u201d\nBouden\u2019s emergence into the spotlight did take many by surprise. Aged 63, she has spent her career at Tunisia\u2019s higher education and scientific research ministry and as a university lecturer.\nBut H\u00e8la Yousfi, sociology lecturer at Paris Dauphine University, said the appointment was not surprising, given Saied\u2019s own background as a law professor turned politician.\n\u201cKais Saied was brought to power by a popular extra-parliamentary movement, which expressed its total mistrust of the political class,\u201d said Yousfi. \u201cSo there is a consistency there with the nomination of someone from outside the political class. It\u2019s consistent with the Tunisian people\u2019s complete crisis of faith in the political class, which has failed for 10 years to fulfil the aspirations of the Tunisian revolution.\u201d\nThere are fears that Bouden will have little room for manoeuvre. Saied has kept in place the emergency measures he introduced in July, in effect ensuring that the prime minister will be solely responsible to him. Some have predicted she will be a mere pawn of the president.\nYousfi acknowledged the risk, but said it was too soon to tell how things would pan out in the country\u2019s unpredictable political landscape.\n\u201cIf my experience of Tunisian politics has taught me anything, it\u2019s to wait and see,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one thought Kais Saied could nominate a woman as head of the government. It\u2019s possible [her role could be constricted]: he has an organic conception of power.\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen. We must wait for the [political] programme, the vision, and also what is proposed in terms of an institutional roadmap. We are in limbo at the moment. We must wait and see.\u201d",

Concerns have been raised about the lack of essential items and support due to the lack of accurate information on many of the Afghan nationals and their children who were evacuated to the UK in August.\nAs a result, the Home Office made a military assistance to the civil authorities (Maca) request for assistance in improving the data on the families.\nThe military has been instructed to gather data on how best to match individuals and families into settled housing.\nThis includes gathering information on their levels of English and where their individual needs would result in the most successful integration, such as finding any local connections Afghans may have in the UK.\nHome Office officials have refused to guarantee that all Afghans would be moved out of hotel accommodation by Christmas.\nMore than 8,000 Afghan nationals were evacuated to the UK in August under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap).\nThe department has struggled to persuade local authorities to come forward to help, with the number of permanent homes offered by councils so far only enough to house around half of those evacuated to the UK under the Arap scheme.\nA report by the Refugee Council, which works with many of those who have fled Afghanistan, warned last month that many Afghans housed in hotels had no access to essentials such as sanctuary products, toothpaste, nappies or medicines.\nIn addition to the 7,000 Afghans, there are about 13,000 asylum seekers also currently living in \u201cbridging hotels\u201d due to the lack of available accommodation.\nOf these, about 70 are unaccompanied children, 16 of whom are under the age of 16.\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cIn the rush to evacuate people from Afghanistan it seems there were gaps in capturing important information which reflects how the government had to move at speed during a chaotic time and the Home Office were operating with no additional operational capacity.\n\u201cThese families, including young children, have had to deal with an incredible amount of trauma and upheaval in their lives. Their mental wellbeing is extremely precarious and it\u2019s critical that they get the support, advice and information.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history brought arouund 15,000 people to safety in the UK. A significant cross-government effort is under way to ensure the thousands of Afghans who were evacuated to the UK receive the support they need to rebuild their lives, find work, pursue education, and integrate into their local communities.\n\u201cIt is completely incorrect to suggest we do not know how many people are in hotels. Military personnel are supporting the Home Office to gather information that will help the government best match individuals and families into settled housing and support their integration into the UK.\u201d",

        "content": "Plus: the proliferation of yellow Premier League kits and can any club anthem beat Bubbles for longevity?\nMail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU\n\u201cAs a Derby fan this has been a somewhat miserable time,\u201d begins Mark Ward. \u201cWith the announcement of our 12-point deduction for going into administration, I was wondering whether any team had weathered a similar punishment without being relegated? If so, with the threat of another nine-point deduction hanging over Pride Park, what\u2019s the biggest penalty given to a club that avoided relegation?\u201d\nLet\u2019s start with a tale about a bouncebackable Old Lady. \u201cI suspect Serie B in 2006-07 isn\u2019t quite the reply your reader is looking for, but it\u2019s always interesting to remember Juventus\u2019s brief sojourn in Italy\u2019s second tier,\u201d writes Alan Gomes. \u201cJuve were relegated in the aftermath of the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal and deducted a whopping 30 points. That was later reduced to nine points. Juventus didn\u2019t just avoid relegation: they won the league, finishing six points ahead of second-placed Napoli.\n\u201cEven if the original 30-point deduction had stood, Juventus would have finished eighth \u2013 only four points off promotion, and a comfortable distance away from the relegation zone. That Juventus squad did have the likes of Gianluigi Buffon, Alessandro Del Piero, Pavel Nedved and David Trezeguet.\u201d\nDerby are currently 23 points off the leaders, Bournemouth, and sans World Cup-winners, but happily there are some more relatable precedents closer to home. \u201cThe best post-deduction performance in the EFL must be Leeds in League One in 2007-08,\u201d writes Matt Robb. \u201cDespite losing 15 points at the start of the season they reached the play-offs with 76 points. The on-pitch total was 91 which would have been enough for promotion.\n\u201cAlso in League One, Southampton just missed out on a play-off spot after losing 10 points in 2009-10. A year earlier, Rotherham and Bournemouth stayed in League Two despite 17-point deductions. One of them was pretty much guaranteed survival though, as Luton had lost 30 points. Chester were the other relegated side despite a 17-point head start. Grimsby also finished below Bournemouth, while Rotherham ended the season in a respectable 14th.\n\u201cFinally, in 2018-19, Birmingham stayed in the Championship despite losing nine points for profitability and sustainability breaches. The bad news for Derby is that all these were achieved by clubs who were out of administration at the start of the season. The record for clubs going into administration during a season is less encouraging.\u201d\nIt helps if you get off to a good start. \u201cIn 2009-10, Crystal Palace went into administration while in the Championship and were deducted 10 points in the January,\u201d writes Martin Jones. \u201cDespite this, and having to sell key players such as future European champion Jos\u00e9 Fonte and future Premier League-winner Victor Moses, the fact Palace were relatively handily placed in the league at the time of the deduction meant we eventually survived after a last-day draw at Sheffield Wednesday, who went down as a result.\u201d Palace finished 21st, two points ahead of Sheffield Wednesday. Without the deduction, they would have ended up in 13th.\nLet\u2019s finish where we started, in Italy. Juventus\u2019s class of 2007 aren\u2019t the only ones to overcome a handicap. \u201cPoints deductions are a typical punishment for match-fixing and let\u2019s say Italian football has had its fair share of those,\u201d says Alexandre Chesneau. \u201cIn that same 2006-07 season, only this time in Serie A, Fiorentina and Reggina were docked 15 and 11 points respectively. Both teams survived, and Fiorentina even qualified for the Uefa Cup by finishing sixth.\u201d Without the points deduction, they would have come third.\n\u201cThe other example is Lazio in Serie B in 1986-87, who stayed up after a relegation play-off despite a nine-point deduction,\u201d continues Alexandre. \u201cThat was back when a win was worth two points, so it was effectively a 13-point deduction (four wins and a draw) in today\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\u201cWest Ham fans have been singing \u2018Bubbles\u2019 since the 1920s. Has any other English club such a long standing anthem,\u201d asks Chris Grant.\nLet\u2019s be havin\u2019 you then, Norwich fans. \u201cI immediately thought of my beloved Norwich\u2019s \u2018On The Ball, City\u2019, which has been sung since the club\u2019s formation in 1902,\u201d writes Will Hedges-Tucker (and fives of other Canaries supporters). \u201cIn fact, the song is older than the club itself having been used by earlier Norwich-based teams since the 1890s.\u201d\n\u201cThere are an awful lot of yellow kits in this season\u2019s Premier League,\u201d begins Leon Wilde. \u201cDiscounting Manchester United\u2019s fetching yellow shorts seen earlier this season at Southampton the following nine teams all have (predominantly) yellow shirts as part of their lineup of kits for 2021-22.\n\u201cArsenal (away), Brentford (away), Brighton (third), Chelsea (away), Crystal Palace (away), Liverpool (third), Norwich (home), Southampton (away), Watford (home). Is this a record for the English top flight and does this question cut the custard mustard?\u201d\nWe\u2019ve not been able to find a season with a greater number of yellow outfield playing kits on show. The Premier League had seven in 2013-14 (eight if you allow Swansea\u2019s yellow and blue away kit) but there was a proliferation of yellow goalkeeping tops in the 2019-20 season to match the nine outfield ones this term, perhaps because looking like a six-foot-plus canary has been proven to put strikers off.\n\u201cThere is a long and embarrassing history of footballers releasing novelty singles (and more), but do any show a deeper commitment to music?\u201d asked James Hampson in October 2013. \u201cHas there ever been a footballer with a music qualification, for example?\u201d\nDavid Rae has an answer, of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll not be the only person to respond to this one with the name James Allan. I\u2019m not sure about the music qualification but James is currently the frontman for an extremely successful, popular beat-combo called Glasvegas but in a previous life he was a professional footballer, playing for such titans of the Scottish game as Cowdenbeath, East Fife, Queens Park, Stirling Albion, Gretna (RIP) and Dumbarton.\n\u201cHe was recently on BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s irreverent footballing show Off The Ball and stated that he is probably the only person to have scored a goal at Hampden Park when playing for Queens Park in a professional league and to have performed on stage at Hampden when Glasvegas supported U2.\u201d\n\u201cAfter eight matchdays of La Liga\u2019s season, Villarreal, the only unbeaten team left, sit in 11th place. They have played one game less than most teams, but even so, can any other side claim a more disappointing unbeaten start to the season?\u201d asks Eugene Francis.\nLooking at the Ukrainian Premier League table, I noticed at least three clubs named after bodies of water (Desna Chernihiv, Vorskla Poltava, Chornomorets Odessa)-- Does any other top league have more???\n\u201cRecently, Netherlands\u2019 national team manager and former Champions League winner Louis van Gaal went to manage Telstar, a second division side in the Netherlands, for one match to raise money for charity purposes. Did any other manager ever manage a side for one match only, apart from assistant managers temporarily taking over the job? Or even better: did any other manager ever have such a bizarre double-function?\u201d asks Fausto van Bronkhorst.\nWith Smalling and Abraham scoring for Roma. When was the last time two English players scored for a non British side in Europe/Top League\n\u201cI had a question that came to me after seeing the call up of Saint-\u00c9tienne goalkeeper Etienne Green to the England U21 side this week. Have there ever been any other instances of a footballer whose name incorporates both their club\u2019s name and colour so perfectly,\u201d asks Robert Newman.\n\u201cDejan Stankovic represented Yugoslavia at the 1998 World Cup, Serbia & Montenegro at the 2006 World Cup & plain old Serbia in 2010, which technically means he represented three different countries at the World Cup. If we were to throw the youth level tournaments into the mix, can any player beat that?\u201d asks Stephen Toal.\nArnar Gunnlaugsson had five separate spells with \u00cdA (also managing them on two separate occasions). Have any players had more with the same club? @TheKnowledge_GU pic.twitter.com/T9lDSknrrn\nMail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

Australia persisted with providing climate finance but delivered it through bilateral partnerships in the Pacific. Pacific nations are strong supporters of the UN-led fund.\nFiame said on Wednesday: \u201cWe are not meeting the financial targets that have been set. I think that is one of the burning questions \u2013 how do we meet that gap?\u201d\nShe said \u201cwe all know Australia\u2019s situation, their position regarding climate change\u201d but Fiame argued if Morrison could bring Australia \u201cback to the climate financing table \u2013 that would be a good start\u201d.\nThe Samoan prime minister\u2019s appeal was echoed by Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, at a separate forum on Wednesday. \u201cEverything we fought for at the Paris Agreement, the 1.5C target, affordable and accessible climate finance, the very survival of our reefs, islands and way of life is on the line in Glasgow,\u201d Bainimarama said.\n\u201cYet we know there are leaders who hope to sneak in and out of Glasgow without making a single serious commitment that will save our planet for coming generations. We cannot let them. I want the children of the Pacific to be the poster children for development, not disasters\u201d.\nThe calls for action come as Morrison is attempting to land an agreement within his government for Australia to adopt a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. Internal negotiations will enter the business end next week.\nLiberal MPs in metropolitan seats are pushing for both a net zero by 2050 target and a roadmap to reach it that would outline shorter-term milestones. But they face resistance from Nationals MPs, mostly from Queensland, who are firmly against the net zero target.\nMorrison has also been signalling he may not attend the Glasgow summit next month. On Tuesday, Australia\u2019s prime minister said his \u201cfirst responsibility\u201d was to explain any new climate commitments \u201cto Australians not to people overseas at overseas conferences\u201d.\nThe UK\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, has said the UK would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if Morrison did not attend the summit.\nOn Wednesday Treadell strengthened her long-standing calls for Australia to increase its medium-term emission reduction pledges, noting that many countries were \u201ccoming up with a revised interim target of between 40 and 50%\u201d by 2030.\n\u201cNo movement would not be acceptable - we would find that disappointing,\u201d Treadell told SBS News.\nFiame said it was up to Morrison whether or not he attended the summit. The Samoan prime minister said she wanted to go but \u201cwe ourselves are finding it very difficult to make our way to Glasgow and even more challenging on the way back\u201d.\nShe said it was important for Pacific leaders to have a significant presence in Glasgow. \u201cWe sincerely hope that the hosts entertain virtual participation in the workings of the Cop26.\u201d\nGiven the extent of the substantive disagreement between Samoa and Australia about the need for urgent climate action, Fiame was asked whether diplomatic relations were at risk. She said that was not the case.\n\u201cIn any relationship, there are things that you agree on and things you don\u2019t agree on,\u201d Samoa\u2019s prime minister said. \u201cYou carry on with what you agree on and continue the dialogue and negotiate on issues that still need work.\u201d\nFiame called on the leaders of the world not to squander the opportunity for action at Glasgow. \u201cWe must continue to push and demand more ambitious climate action from everyone,\u201d she said.\nThe coronavirus pandemic must not be used as an excuse to defer action, she said.\n\u201cThe development of Covid-19 vaccines was the fastest in history,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\u201cThe rollout around the world at large scale required a massive, global, coordinated effort. I often ponder on how we can push for this historical, united, urgent global response at the same massive scale to help us reach the 1.5C promise of the Paris agreement.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Joshua McDonald",

He said some systemic changes would need to be put in place.\n\u201cI know many, many incredibly dedicated police officers, men and women, who are appalled by this and are determined to fix this problem. But we do need to look at culture in the police and the second phase of the review, the inquiry the home secretary announced, is target at that issue,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking later on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Raab acknowledged that the long backlog of cases in the courts was due partly to cuts in the criminal justice system, adding that he hoped it could be cleared within six to 12 months.",

The \u201cmedium\u201d scenario means emissions start to decline by 2045, while under \u201chigh emissions\u201d there are no efforts to curb them, causing temperatures to rise more than 2C by 2040, and 3C after 2060.\nThe report said the cumulative bill for Australia would run into the trillions over the next four decades.\n\u201cOver the next 40 years, the cost of natural disasters to the Australian economy is expected to be at least $1.2tn in present value terms,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis cumulative cost would potentially increase by $125bn if a higher emission scenario eventuates.\u201d\nThe report found two-thirds of the cost will be borne by Queensland and New South Wales, with Melbourne vulnerable to flooding events due to its proximity to major rivers.\nAustralia is already heavily exposed to natural disasters \u2013 fire, flood, hailstorms and hurricanes \u2013 that currently cost the country $39b a year. This figure is expected to rise dramatically as property values increase and more people move into areas vulnerable to extreme weather events that hit harder and more often.\nThe \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario would be a change in weather patterns causing a hurricane to land in south-east Queensland, which has been heavily built up by development.\nIt adds to a growing body of work in Australia and elsewhere that has sought to measure the risks of the climate crisis, including another by London-based thinktank Chatham House in September that considered the impact from climate change tipping points.\nDan Gocher, the director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said even under a low-emissions scenario the figures in the report were \u201ceye-watering\u201d and should serve as a call to action.\n\u201cThis research quantifies the cost of doing nothing about climate change,\u201d Gocher said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect riposte to those who repeatedly question the cost of reducing emissions.\u201d\nErwin Jackson, policy director at the Investor Group on Climate Change, said Australia was highly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change and the government alone could not foot the bill.\nHe said the private sector would invest in resilience and adaptation measures but needed clear policy direction. That had begun with a positive response by government to the bushfire royal commission, and the creation of a National Recovery and Resilience Agency, but more was required, he said.\n\u201cWe look forward to more discussions with the government about how we unlock private sector capital to build resilience to the impacts of climate change,\u201d he said.\nIan Dunlop, from the thinktank Breakthrough \u2013 National Centre for Climate Restoration, said the report was \u201cvery useful in confronting decision-masters with the implications of climate change\u201d but the insurance sector was being \u201ccoy\u201d about the issue.\nHe said deep cuts in emissions were required now to limit the rise in temperatures. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s game over,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Unstable property rights mean Black southerners may survive a flood but lose their home, and it\u2019s causing the racial wealth gap to grow larger\nMargaret Alston doesn\u2019t remember the night that Hurricane Matthew hit, but she remembers how afraid she was of the flooding that followed.\nThe biggest hurricane to hit South Carolina since 1999, the storm caused massive inland flooding across large swaths of the south-east. In Bucksport, the small, unincorporated town where Alston grew up, the Wacamaw River overflowed, inundating the street Alston\u2019s house is on and making it impassable.\n\u201cThe water was everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when I say everywhere, I mean everywhere.\u201d She found refuge at a nearby community center, before moving in temporarily with her sister in Conway, 14 miles away.\nSix years later, she is still in Conway, her house sits abandoned and in disrepair, and the funding allocated to Hurricane Matthew victims has dried up. Alston did apply for and receive some assistance from Fema after the storm, but it was a fraction of what she needed to repair her house \u2013 and mold had set in quickly after the flood.\n\u201cI would be so glad to be back,\u201d Alston says. But she sees little hope in that happening.\nA contractor estimated the total cost to repair and elevate Alston\u2019s home. But in the process of applying for Fema funding, private loans and nonprofit help, Alston discovered that, in many cases, she was eligible for assistance only if the deed to the home and land was in her name. As it turns out, Alston was not eligible, because legally she is not considered the owner of her home.\nAlston\u2019s house \u2013 and the land it sits on \u2013 are what\u2019s known as heirs\u2019 property, meaning they were passed down informally, generation to generation. Alston shares a partial interest in the house with all living descendants of the original deed holder: her grandmother. With each generation, that interest is split again among the newest descendants  \u2013 but none of them hold the actual title.\nThat means that, because she doesn\u2019t legally own the home, she can\u2019t use it as capital for loans and mortgages as other homeowners might. She is also excluded from many federal and state grants historically given to homeowners to recover from disasters. She is now at risk of losing her home entirely. The US Department of Agriculture calls this unstable form of property \u201cthe leading cause of black involuntary land loss\u201d, and increasingly, scholars recognize it as a contributor to the growing racial wealth inequality in the US.\nHeirs\u2019 properties are disproportionately found in the Black Belt \u2013 a tract of more than 600 largely rural, underserved counties with higher-than-average African American populations and high poverty rates. But heirs\u2019 property can occur anywhere where property is passed on without a will.\nFor many, like Alston, living on heirs\u2019 property usually doesn\u2019t become an issue until disaster strikes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem until it\u2019s a problem,\u201d Laura Tuggle, executive director at South Louisiana Legal Services says. And by then, the problem can become very large \u2013 the difference between saving your home or having to abandon it altogether.\nFederal disaster assistance and other grants almost always require clear proof of title.\nAfter Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit New Orleans in 2005, 25,000 heirs\u2019 property owners were denied Fema assistance. Tuggle\u2019s organization assisted thousands of families who were trying to clear the property titles of their homes in order to access recovery dollars.\n\u201cThis is a critical issue for low-income people, especially when you live in coastal areas,\u201d says Tuggle.\nMajor hurricane and flooding events \u2013 from Hurricane Harvey to Maria to Sandy \u2013 have revealed the scope of the problem.\nRoughly 50,000 heirs\u2019 property owners in Puerto Rico were denied Fema assistance after Maria because they couldn\u2019t show proof of ownership, and thousands more surfaced after Harvey in Houston. When Hurricane Matthew hit South Carolina in 2016, more than 18,000 disaster assistance claims were denied. Half of those applications came from the counties with the highest prevalence of heirs\u2019 property in the state.\nDespite the scope of the issue, data on heirs\u2019 property is fractured and incomplete at best. What data does exist suggests that this form of land ownership disproportionately affects Black southerners, with some estimates suggesting that heirs\u2019 property makes up as much as a third of all Black-owned land in the south, and others suggesting it could be as high as 60%.\nThe legacy of explicitly racist housing policies and lack of access to legal services has meant that for many Black families, land passed down informally was often thought of as a secure way to manage property. But heirs\u2019 property doesn\u2019t just affect rural Black Americans. It is found all over the US, particularly in areas historically excluded from the legal system. Outside the Black Belt, heirs\u2019 property is frequently clustered in settlements along the US-Mexico border, tribal lands, and in Appalachia \u2013 but also in cities like New York.\nWherever they are, heirs\u2019 property owners lose out on more than just Fema assistance. Rob Young, who serves on South Carolina\u2019s Flood Water Commission, says the question of homeownership is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d for residents trying to access aid from government agencies like Fema, the Small Business Administration, Hud, and even USDA, in cases where families farm on the land.\n\u201cThe inability of individuals to show clear title,\u201d he says, becomes a roadblock to accessing federal funds for \u201cwhatever it is that they want to fix\u201d.\nWhen homeownership is a standard by which the state determines who does and doesn\u2019t receive aid, the system for cleaning up and preparing for disasters ends up reinforcing inequality.\nFew climate adaptation plans acknowledge the particular challenges that heirs\u2019 property presents. Other non-homeowner groups like low-income renters, who are disproportionately Black, Hispanic and Native American, are similarly excluded from aid and assistance. Experts say lack of attention to this kind of racial inequality when planning for climate change will increase wealth inequality and further the unequal distribution of climate impacts.\nAs of August, Fema has announced changes to the way they verify homeownership for disaster relief applicants unable to show clear titles, such as heirs\u2019 property owners.\nBut disaster relief is only the tip of the iceberg.\nExperts say heirs\u2019 property owners may struggle to unlock the funds that could help them prepare for the next natural disaster, from state and federal grants to private loans and mortgages. In a warming climate, the ability to build more resilient homes and towns, or sell and move to higher ground if needed, is crucial to surviving the effects of the climate crisis.\nAlston is already feeling those effects. Since Matthew, a handful of flooding events in addition to Hurricane Florence in 2018 have wrought further damage on her home. According to the latest estimate her sister received from a contractor, because of the ongoing damage to the house, the cost to repair and elevate it has doubled. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d says Alston. \u201cI just need it repaired.\u201d\nHeirs\u2019 property poses an additional problem to places like Bucksport, where many such properties are clustered together: heirs\u2019 property carries with it the looming threat of displacement, which affects the community as a whole. Now, they\u2019re racing to solve the problem before they get flooded out.\nKevin Mishoe, the president of the Association for the Betterment of Bucksport, is one of the people leading the effort. Among other things, his organization helps residents access Fema and Hud assistance \u2013 and for the last five years, they\u2019ve been busy.\nSince 2016, Bucksport has experienced two intense hurricanes and severe flooding almost every single year. And with every flood, heirs\u2019 property problems surface.\nLocated at the confluence of two of South Carolina\u2019s largest rivers, Bucksport was established by one of the state\u2019s largest slaveholders in the 1820s as a crucial mill and port. Now it\u2019s a small, close-knit community of 735 people.\nMany of the residents in this predominantly Black community can trace their ancestors back to the enslaved people that used to work in the mill, and their descendants who bought land in Bucksport after the civil war. Today, many of them are vested in heirs\u2019 property. \u201cIf I had to guess, I would say at least 40% or higher are in that situation,\u201d says Mishoe. \u201cFor such a small community, that\u2019s a lot.\u201d\nMishoe says the problems related to unresolved heirs\u2019 property have a ripple effect. At a community level, it can hinder development and be a challenge for improvements like creating ditches for flood mitigation. He has watched the population drop every decade in Bucksport, declining by 16% since 2010, and notes the high rates of poverty.\n\u201cAll of these things are interrelated and until you can resolve heirs\u2019 property, a lot of these things you can\u2019t fix,\u201d says Mishoe.\nHazel Bellamy, a Bucksport resident who lives on a few acres of lands that she owns with roughly a dozen other family members, knows these issues intimately.\nStanding in front of her elevated trailer, she points to empty spots where the homes of her relatives once stood. \u201cThis one went after Matthew,\u201d she says, gesturing to a spot next to her with an electrical service line emerging from the ground. Another empty spot nearby shows where her niece\u2019s trailer stood before it was wiped out after Florence.\nMany heirs\u2019 property owners live in manufactured homes on their land, often shared among family members. In an era where affordable housing is scarce, heirs\u2019 property can often fill a void. But it\u2019s an unstable form of land ownership. All it takes is one person with a fractional interest in the land to force a sale. And if the remaining owners can\u2019t buy the property, all of them can end up losing their homes.\nThe threat of a sale is heightened after flooding or storms, when the heirs\u2019 property owners are denied adequate financial assistance to repair their home.\n\u201cWhen something like that happens, you\u2019re more vulnerable as a family to speculation of your land,\u201d says Joshua Walden, head of operations at the Center for Heirs\u2019 Property Preservation in South Carolina. Land developers can acquire an interest in the property by buying it from, for example, an out-of-state heir and then force a sale.\nIn 2017, South Carolina, along with several other states, implemented a law designed in part to prevent developers from using this loophole to force a sale of the land. The Uniform Partition of Heirs\u2019 Property Act gives heirs\u2019 property owners the first right to buy another heirs\u2019 fractional interest if they want to sell, among other safeguards.\nBut partition sales have been and remain a significant source of Black land loss, from the Gullah Geechee barrier islands down the coast of the Carolinas and Florida, through to Black-owned farmland.\nThis has a growing number of climate activists concerned, considering that the south-east, south and central US have experienced more billion-dollar weather and climate disasters than any other region in the US and are expected to be especially hard hit by climate change.\nUnless they want to pay out of pocket, most heirs\u2019 property owners are dependent on pro bono legal services, state legal aid services or organizations like the South Carolina Center for Heirs\u2019 Property Preservation to clear up their titles. Bellamy once pooled together a few thousand dollars from her family to hire a lawyer \u2013 but was informed that her property difficulties were much more complicated and would require more time and money to resolve.\nYoung, who is also the director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University, says that without specific attention to this problem in both disaster planning and climate adaptation, heirs\u2019 property owners will continue to \u201cfall between the cracks\u201d.\nHe points out that the US still does not have a national climate adaptation strategy; instead, states and cities have largely been at the forefront of adapting to the climate crisis. But the vast majority of the money for climate adaptation comes from federal disaster assistance programs at Fema, Hud and the Army Corps of Engineers. And inequalities persistent in disaster assistance programs will be carried over to those programs meant to address climate adaptation.\nBut recently, experts say they see some signs of change.\nThe American Flood Coalition, a non-partisan coalition advocating for solutions to flooding and sea level rise, has singled out heirs\u2019 property as a critical barrier to equitable flooding and disaster recovery policy. The Florida Housing Coalition\u2019s newly launched Center for Racial Equity has stated that resolving heirs\u2019 property will be their first climate justice goal. And some organizations are calling for a comprehensive federal strategy for protecting heirs\u2019 property.\nFor his part, Mishoe is tackling this issue headfirst. In May, together with the Center for Heirs\u2019 Property Preservation he helped to organize a workshop in Bucksport on will creation, estate management and title clearing. Dozens of participants attended. Now, his organization has hired a dedicated point person to help residents file wills. He hopes this will help residents maintain their lands and homes, and build a more resilient community in the face of more intense flooding, which scientists say is practically guaranteed.\n\u201cWe have to really make this grassroots effort in getting the people to understand that if they\u2019re going to keep it, and build a stronger community, they have to resolve heirs\u2019 property issues and they have to look at flood mitigation and force our officials to address the issues of flood mitigation in the community.\u201d\nThe way he sees it, the failure to recognize the obstacles that heirs\u2019 property poses to respond to future climate disasters like floods spells trouble for the collective. \u201cThe survival of this community [is] very much in jeopardy,\u201d he says.\nThis story was written with support from the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.",

        "content": "It is refreshing to return to the world of Battlefield: two big sides and lots of multi-level combat\nIn the distance, a skyscraper towers above the island foliage, its lights flickering on in the stormy twilight. This is the target, the final objective our side needs to take to achieve total dominance of the map. The only problem is, we have to get to the top of the tower and from the silent muzzle flashes erupting from its rooftop, it is well defended. We will need air support as well as coordinated infiltration by a range of skilled operatives. Meanwhile, I have got my jeep lodged between two garages.\nThis is the world of Battlefield, really as we have always known it. A vast landscape, a range of different character classes, aircraft zooming overhead and moments of both astonishing skill and ludicrous incompetence. But judging by the hands-on session I attended two days before the public beta, Battlefield 2042 takes all these elements and seeks to ramp up the tactical possibilities and disparities even further.\nThe map we played was Orbital, described by developer EA Dice as a medium-sized location, set in Kourou in French Guiana. There is a giant rocket launch site, a few skyscrapers dotted about, a cryogenics laboratory and an industrial centre with complex buildings entwined by raised metal walkways. The mode we\u2019re playing is Conquest \u2013 the classic Battlefield option, where two huge teams battle to control objective points all over the map. The difference now is that that the map is split into sectors which each contain more than one objective point, so teams have to control them all to claim the sector.\nIt\u2019s an interesting evolution, no doubt intended to encourage more coordinated attacks rather than the chaotic mass brawls we tend to see over specific points. What\u2019s clear is that Battlefield 2042 is about tactical agility. It\u2019s set amid a futuristic global conflict where a combination of ecological disaster and a satellite-killing space storm has plunged the world into anarchy, but the tech is still cutting edge. So now we can call in vehicles to our position wherever we are on the map \u2013 that might be a light-armoured vehicle, a tank or a scout robot, which looks like one of those terrifying canine things that Boston Dynamics has made, and it trots happily after you across the landscape spotting and firing at enemies.\nYou\u2019re also able to change your weapon loadout on the fly within the game. Hit a button and an AR display pops up on screen from your character\u2019s wrist, showing all your gun\u2019s current add-ons. Right there, you can change the scope, the barrel, add a grip, suppressor or a flashlight, all in a couple of quick moves. There\u2019s already some debate over how useful this will be, but I found it advantageous when packing a sniper loadout. While you\u2019re running through the field to get to a good vantage point, you can switch to a standard scope and use your gun like a standard one-shot rifle, which will keep you alive longer than a handgun. Also, wrist-based AR interfaces are fun and make you feel like you\u2019re in a Tom Cruise movie.\nThe four character classes \u2013 recon, assault, support and engineer \u2013 are very familiar but they bring some new benefits. The assault operative has a neat grapple gun that lets him reach vertical positions at lightning speed, while the support character has a S21 Syrette Pistol which lets her fire meds at teammates from distance. More standard are the engineer who has a sentry turret and the recon chap who can control an armed drone over the field \u2013 he also has a sensor which warns you of nearby enemies, which is useful amid heavy foliage or inside dark buildings.\nOn the PC the conquest mode is going to support 128 players at once (64 on consoles), but EA Dice has said that matches may well utilise AI bots to fill in spaces if they are short of players. I don\u2019t know how many were playing in my matches, but they weren\u2019t hard to spot or kill, moving deliberately, and reacting with treacly nonchalance when under fire. Perhaps they will improve as they\u2019re exposed to more player data.\nEA has also made a big deal of the game\u2019s live scenic events. There are tornadoes that swirl in from the sea, ripping up buildings and vehicles as they go \u2013 and it\u2019s a truly mesmerising sight. The Orbital map also has a space rocket that will prepare for take off during a match. Players are apparently able to damage it with heavy fire during this process so that it explodes on the launch pad causing catastrophic damage. We\u2019ve seen both Call of Duty and previous Battlefield games experimenting with these sorts of in-match events and it\u2019s always difficult to know if the initial novelty will lead to anything strategically interesting or just get in the way.\nAs for visual performance, EA Dice is touting the latest iteration of its Frostbite game engine as a groundbreaking move forward and on my PC (Intel i7-9700F, 3Ghz, 32GB ram with a Geforce RTX 3060 graphics card) the world looked sharp and filled with detail, from birds scattering amid the trees to astonishing mid-air fighter jet explosions \u2013 all on the highest graphical settings. There were a few sluggish moments during intense firefights, but I didn\u2019t get chance to really interrogate the settings menu which is extremely comprehensive. The game also supports Nvidia\u2019s DLSS and Reflex Low Latency modes to improve responsiveness, but again, with only three hours of play it was tough to figure out how much this was doing. What I do know is that the dynamic weather is pretty incredible, the rain coming in over the hills turning the sky slate grey, leeching out all the light and leaving you squinting into what was just a few minutes ago, a well-lit goods yard.\nOne thing is certain: this is wholeheartedly a classic Battlefield game. The map is large and varied, with clustered pinch points and vast open areas for tank battles; it even has a long tunnel section like the old Damavand Peak map in Battlefield 3 so you reach the frontline at considerable speed. You can play close to your four-player squad, spawning in on each other and working as a team, or you can go off by yourself, circling behind enemy control points to sneakily claim them without anyone noticing. It has a similar gritty documentary look and feel as the last two titles, with its high-pitched gunfire and the instant deadliness of some weapons. Often you don\u2019t know where the fire came from.\nThe gaming world has been so caught up in battle royale dynamics over the last two years, it is refreshing to be back here in the world of Battlefield: two big sides, lots of multi-level combat with vehicles everywhere, and those moments where seven strangers suddenly come together in an instantenously choreographed attack, and you can forget about that moment, a few minutes before, when you accidentally drove your tank off a cliff.\n Battlefield 2042 is released on 19 November for PC, PS4/5 and Xbox One/Series X/S.",

The tactic comes amid a battle for lorry drivers that led Tesco to offer new sign-ups a \u00a31,000 incentive this summer.\nTesco\u2019s rail service already includes five trains a week that bring fresh produce to the UK from Spain. From next month, Tesco will add two new UK food transport train services, including one that will link Spain with Scotland.\nMurphy said Tesco was one of only three retailers that used a significant amount of rail freight. \u201cThis is a fantastic story from a sustainability point of view but it has really come into its own helping our supply chain resilience,\u201d he said.\nThe UK\u2019s biggest supermarket doubled profits in the first half of the year as it reduced costs related to the coronavirus pandemic and said its strong supply chain had meant it experienced fewer shortages than rivals despite the industry\u2019s widespread delivery problems.\nSales rose 3% to \u00a327.3bn in the six months to 28 August and profits soared by 107% to \u00a31.1bn.\nTesco said its shoppers had sought out clothing and other household goods while it got a boost from more families holidaying in the UK because of travel restrictions and the Euro 2020 football tournament, which was postponed to the summer of 2021.\n\u201cAs industry supply chains came under increasing pressure, we were able to leverage our strong supplier relationships and distribution capability to maintain good levels of availability for customers, contributing to our market outperformance,\u201d it said.\nTesco\u2019s online business continued to grow \u2013 by 2.3% \u2013 and shoppers stuck to big shops and large supermarkets as Covid concerns remained. Sales in its convenience stores fell as those in commuter areas lost out from the switch to working from home. The company is testing out a fast-track grocery service \u2013 Whoosh \u2013 from its convenience stores and this is now in 60 shops.\nMurphy said Tesco was launching a \u00a3500m share buyback for investors as it expected to make up to \u00a32.6bn of profits for the full year, about \u00a3700m more than previously anticipated.\nShares in Tesco jumped 5.9% to 268.05p, the top riser on the FTSE 100 index.\nThe profits upgrade came despite a \u00a3193m payout to shareholders related to a legal case linked to an accounting scandal at Tesco from 2014. A recovery at Tesco\u2019s bank, which returned to profit, helped offset continued additional costs relating to Covid-19 and the repayment of business rates relief to the government.\nMurphy said sales growth continued to be strong and he did not expect any significant stock shortages in the run-up to Christmas because Tesco would use its strong relationships with suppliers to secure enough goods.\nThe supermarket has secured 10% more turkeys for Christmas than last year, for example, with sales of frozen birds already running ahead as shoppers aim to secure a festive centrepiece early.\nFuture profits will be partly boosted by a new target of \u00a31bn in cost savings over the next three years. Tesco\u2019s finance director said this would not be about significant job cuts but about many efficiencies, including more automation in warehouses and considering the closures of some head office space now that more staff were working from home.\nThe group will take on 30,000 temporary staff in the run-up to Christmas and Murphy said half of those were already in place and he did not expect major problems with recruiting the rest.",

A plant-based version of Cadbury\u2019s classic bar is to go on sale in the UK next month as part of a drive by major food companies to expand their vegan ranges.\nThe company, which used to make much of the \u201cglass and a half\u201d of milk in every bar, is using almond paste in the Cadbury Plant Bar, which has taken two years to develop. It said the new recipe \u201cprovides a similar taste and texture to milk ingredients while offering a hint of nuttiness\u201d.\nTwo flavours will be available, smooth chocolate and smooth chocolate with salted caramel pieces, and will come in 100% plant-based packaging from renewable sources.

At Mondel\u0113z, evolving consumer demands have long informed our ambition to provide a wide range of products that work for everyone and the new Cadbury Plant Bar range is the latest stop on this journey.\u201d\nThe restaurant chain Wagamama said on Wednesday that half of its menu was now plant-based after it added new vegan options for customers.\nAmong the new dishes are a spicy vegan \u201cshort rib\u201d ramen using mushroom and soya, a jackfruit option and several based on a chicken alternative that it said \u201cmirrors the taste and texture of pulled chicken\u201d.",

She is struggling to make ends meet even before the cut comes into effect. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely terrified. At the moment, I end up with no money at the end of the month, and that\u2019s with this uplift. I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t smoke, I don\u2019t have Netflix, but I still run out of money. I want to work, but I can\u2019t at the moment \u2013 I just look after my son, that\u2019s a full-time job.\u201d\nBowden is worried about the cut coinciding with the beginning of winter, especially amid rising fuel and food prices. \u201cLife is going to cost more,\u201d she says. Bowden has used food banks before, but worries about the lack of fresh food on offer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for pasta and stuff like that but all you get is tinned and processed stuff \u2013 you can\u2019t live off that. I want my son to be healthy. \u201d\nScott Edwards, a 46-year-old single father in Nottinghamshire, said the uplift had allowed him to access better employment opportunities. \u201cI have a part-time job as a technical assistant, which I managed to get because the uplift helped me travel to a different town and get a better job,\u201d Edwards said. The rise meant he could pay for petrol to drive to work and buy a car from a charity. \u201cIt helped me move away from poverty. A simple \u00a320 a week makes a massive difference in my life because I\u2019m not on that much money anyway, but it allowed me to get out of debt.\u201d\nAs the sole carer for his four-year-old daughter, Edwards is not able to take on more hours to make up the difference. \u201cI\u2019m on \u00a39.60 an hour, but for me to earn that extra \u00a320, I\u2019d have to actually work a whole day,\u201d he said, owing to the universal credit system\u2019s 63% taper rate, which means that for every pound someone is paid above a work allowance, their benefit is reduced by 63p. \u201cBecause of my situation with looking after my child, that\u2019s not possible.\u201d\nEdwards said the cut meant he would have to return to using food banks. \u201cMy daughter will be fine, it\u2019s me that will go without. I\u2019ve used food banks to the point of them knowing me by name. It\u2019s highly embarrassing because of the way people look at you. I\u2019m proud to be a single father and making the right moves in life for my daughter, but this feels like a massive step back.\u201d\nPeter, 52, in Caithness, Scotland, began receiving universal credit in 2019, after he became ill with sepsis after an accident. Unable to work, his relationship fell apart and he found himself homeless within six months. \u201cI went to the Highland council and they told me there was a five-year waiting list for housing in Inverness, so I had to relocate 100 miles away from family and friends,\u201d he said. He has struggled to find work there due to lack of employment opportunities on offer in the town. \u201cIt\u2019s a catch-22 between housing and employment.\u201d\nPeter, who had previously worked as an administrator, said the change in his circumstances was sudden. \u201cI was a professional person with a home, a partner and a life. The wheels can come off very quickly for anyone. Life on universal credit is not a life at all \u2013 it is a barely tolerable existence.\u201d\nMoney will be even tighter after the cut. \u201cAfter my overheads, which themselves are cut to the bone, I have calculated that I will have \u00a37.92 a day for food, toiletries, travel, clothing and life in general,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery week I have to make some very basic choices, between showering and using the oven or washing machine.\u201d As it comes in at the start of winter, the cut will be a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d along with rising utility bills. \u201cI\u2019ve got to try and stay employable, try to stay positive and communicative, but it grinds you down. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\nDavid Taylor, 45, has been on universal credit for the last four years and has been caring for his 75-year-old uncle. \u201cHe is seriously disabled \u2013 he\u2019s got Parkinson\u2019s and dementia. He needs 24 hour care, because he can\u2019t walk, or talk. He needs help bathing, dressing and eating, he has constant falls. I haven\u2019t been able to leave the house for the past two years, I can only get deliveries, I have no life left. It\u2019s inhuman and disgusting. How am I supposed to leave a seriously disabled person on his own in order to rejoin society?\u201d\nCombined with surging energy and food costs, the \u00a320 cut will leave Taylor in a dire position. \u201cWe\u2019re barely surviving. Bills are just about to go up \u2013 I started off paying \u00a3120 a month, and it\u2019s now \u00a3270. My weekly shop has also doubled since the pandemic started. I\u2019ll have to miss meals.\u201d\nTaylor is worried that he will have no longer be able to support his uncle. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to consider putting my uncle into a home against his will, which is something I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d",

Which impulse will win?\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAlessia Teresko, a 21-year-old student from Nottingham, seldom wears the same outfit online twice. Which is why, last month, for a friend\u2019s birthday, she bought a minidress: a 70s-style Zara dress in a swirling print, for which she paid \u00a327.99. On Instagram, she posted a photograph of herself in her new dress, with a caption that read \u201cBesties wknd\u201d. The post racked up 296 likes and with it, Teresko\u2019s Zara purchase was sent to the giant wardrobe in the sky. (Namely, the Depop account, where she resells the clothes she no longer wears.) \u201cI can\u2019t take another picture in it because I already posted it,\u201d says Teresko. \u201cI know that sounds very superficial.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIn Edinburgh, 23-year-old Mikaela Loach, a student and climate justice activist, understands the pressure that Teresko is under. \u201cHonestly,\u201d she says, \u201cas someone with a platform, even I feel pressure to be wearing different clothes online.\u201d She buys her clothes secondhand. \u201cOnly if I can\u2019t find it secondhand,\u201d Loach says, \u201cwill I buy something new and then make sure I\u2019ve done rigorous research on the company.\u201d\nJust two years and a few hundred miles separate these women, but in their perspectives on sustainability, they might as well be speaking different languages. Teresko and Loach represent a dichotomy within Generation Z that is becoming increasingly pronounced. Whereas Gen Z, a term used to refer to people born between 1997 and 2012, is typically thought of as socially progressive and environmentally aware, it is also a rapacious consumer of fast fashion, one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries, often linked to human rights abuses in the global south.\nA 2020 Vogue Business survey of 105 members of Generation Z found that more than half reported buying most of their clothes from fast-fashion brands. Around half the young people they surveyed said that they would continue to purchase from Boohoo, even after learning that workers in Leicester factories that supplied the fast-fashion giant were paid less than \u00a34 an hour. Data from the market research firm Mintel suggests that Gen Z out-consumes older generations when it comes to fashion purchases: 64% of British 16- to 19-year-olds admit to buying clothes they have never worn, compared with 44% of all adults surveyed. And yet Mintel data also shows that Gen Z claims to care more about the environmental impact of their purchases: 70% of 16-19-year-olds agree that sustainability is an important factor when purchasing fashion items, compared with just 20% of 65- to 74-year-olds.\nHow to explain this schism, and the fact that a generation that has given the world Greta Thunberg, the climate change activist who excoriates the fashion industry from the pages of Vogue Scandinavia, also produced Love Island runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, recently announced as the creative director of the ultra-low-cost fast-fashion brand PrettyLittleThing in a rumoured seven-figure deal? \u201cIt did seem paradoxical to us, which is why we wanted to shed some light on it,\u201d says Malthe Overgaard, a former researcher at Aarhus Business School. In 2020, Overgaard co-authored a paper with fellow researcher Nikolas R\u00f8nholt which surveyed members of Gen Z to find out why they consumed fast fashion while professing to care about sustainability and the environment.\n\u201cYoung people have this feeling of complexity and ambiguity related to sustainability,\u201d says Overgaard. \u201cThey all agreed that they thought of themselves as conscious consumers, but on the other hand, they were incentivised to buy more and consume more because of the need to stay trendy.\u201d\nScott Bowden, 23, a delivery driver from Saltash, has online shopping delivered to his house so frequently that his dad has a running joke with the postman. \u201cThe guy who delivers to my house finds it funny how many clothes I\u2019ve ordered,\u201d Bowden says. Bowden estimates he spends around \u00a350 a week on clothes, usually from Asos, but occasionally from the ultra-low-cost retailer Shein. Bowden is aware of some of the ethical issues around purchasing fast fashion. \u201cRecently, when all the stuff came out about people [at other companies] not being paid the minimum wage,\u201d he says, \u201cstuff like that makes you feel awful, if it\u2019s true that they are getting paid that little.\u201d\nBut Bowden is a regular young person, working, seeing his friends, and conforming to the pressure we all feel \u2013 young and old \u2013 to look fashionable. He is not familiar with the ins and outs of fast fashion\u2019s supply chain. \u201cIf it came out that people were being mistreated or underpaid,\u201d says Bowden, doubtfully, \u201cit would make me think twice about buying from a brand.\u201d This, says Overgaard, is a common response among the Gen Z members surveyed. \u201cThey feel that they don\u2019t have enough information about the products, and how they are being produced.\u201d\nLoach can relate to this sentiment. \u201cWhen I was at school,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019d buy new things all the time and I never really considered the impact of my habits or how harmful the industry was.\u201d What changed for Loach was watching the 2015 documentary The True Cost, which explored the environmental damage and labour violations inherent within the global garment industry. \u201cIt was transformational,\u201d she says. But she feels empathy for people who, as she once did, choose not to engage with the reality of fast fashion. \u201cThe fashion industry is designed to be exploitative and that opaqueness, the lack of transparency, is what allows it to exist,\u201d says Loach.\nOf course, not all young people would stop buying fast fashion if they were forced to confront the reality of the industry they are supporting. Some do know, and choose to purchase anyway. When I ask Teresko if she knows that people are being exploited to make her clothes, she is honest. \u201cI am aware but I don\u2019t really actively think about it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I buy something online, I\u2019m not thinking, \u2018that\u2019s fast fashion, I shouldn\u2019t buy it\u2019. Has she ever felt guilty about buying fast fashion? \u201cI have never felt like that. I only feel guilty if I spend a lot of money.\u201d\nMoney: when it all comes down to it, this is what keeps the fast fashion water-wheel turning. Every generation of young people has embraced the newest fashions, whether it was the flappers of the 1920s or the hippies of the 1970s. But before the advent of brands such as Boohoo and Missguided, which had the effect of pushing down prices across the entire industry, it was too expensive for young people to buy new clothes every week. Nowadays, \u00a33 party frocks and \u00a315 tracksuits are routine. \u201cI would rather buy 20 things for \u00a350,\u201d Teresko says, \u201cbecause I feel like I am getting more worth than from two things.\u201d\nSocial media has intensified the pace at which young people are encouraged to consume. \u201cHaul\u201d videos, in which people unpack large orders of clothes, are ubiquitous on YouTube and TikTok. Because social media thrives on novelty \u2013 no one wants to see the same outfit posted dozens of times \u2013 trends that would have stuck around for months, even years, disappear in weeks. \u201cPlanned obsolescence is such a feature of fast fashion,\u201d says Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University. \u201cThe marketing machine makes us feel that last season is not quite right for this season, if you want to look hot.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you think about how fast fashion has sped up,\u201d says Aja Barber, author of Consumed: the need for collective change: colonialism, climate change, and consumerism, \u201cif you think about the popularity of social media, there\u2019s a huge connection there. I don\u2019t remember being encouraged to spend and buy the way that teenagers are spending and buying today, because social media didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nInfluencers fuel this cycle of overconsumption. The footballer Jack Grealish and the rapper DaBaby have both released collections with BoohooMan. Teresko is a fan of Molly-Mae Hague and Kylie Jenner. \u201cKylie is such an icon,\u201d she says. But Loach believes that we need to hold the public figures collaborating with fast-fashion brands to account. \u201cThe fast fashion industry is not being propped up by people who need to shop there,\u201d Loach says. \u201cIt\u2019s being propped up by people who want to wear a new outfit every week, or by influencers who promote people buying huge amounts of clothing.\u201d\nMany Gen Z teens do prefer to buy secondhand, often using the reselling app Depop (recently sold to Etsy in a $1.6bn deal). \u201cThe Post Office hates me,\u201d sighs Evan Sellick, 16, a student from Cwmbran, south Wales. Sellick is a Depop reseller: his online secondhand store, Clothing View, has nearly 6,000 followers. \u201cPeople say that vintage is expensive,\u201d Sellick says, \u201cbut in reality it\u2019s well under retail price, the quality is better and it\u2019s not made cheaply in factories.\u201d\nBut buying vintage or secondhand is not always an option, particularly for young people who want to dress fashionably but do not fit into so-called straight (meaning six to 18 ) sizes. While there are size-inclusive sustainable brands, including Birdsong and WithLoveEvie, many ethical brands stop at size 18. \u201cPrettyLittleThing just did a catwalk show,\u201d says Sophie Coates, 20, a student from east Yorkshire. \u201cHonestly, it looked incredible. There were models of all sizes and shapes. You feel like you\u2019re wanted in those sorts of brands.\u201d\nCoates struggles to shop secondhand. \u201cVintage stores don\u2019t have curve sizes,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are all standard fittings \u2013 and with the outfits that do fit your size, they are not very body-positive. They don\u2019t show off your skin. They are oversized and baggy.\u201d She would prefer to buy sustainably, but as there are limited options in her size, she shops at Boohoo, Misguided and Shein. \u201cI wish there were sustainable brands that did the new trends,\u201d she says.\nIronically, reselling apps may also facilitate overconsumption. \u201cI resell a lot of my clothes on Depop,\u201d says Bowden. \u201cSales are usually pretty quick.\u201d Teresko uses the money from her Depop sales to subsidise her \u00a3100-a-month fast-fashion habit. But Perry warns against clearing out your wardrobe to recoup more money to spend on fast fashion. \u201cWe can\u2019t shop our way to sustainability,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to slow down our consumption. The whole idea of buying stuff, wearing it once and sticking it on eBay or Depop \u2013 that needs slowing right down.\u201d\nWhat also becomes apparent from speaking to Gen Z is that many buy from sustainable or eco-friendly ranges within fast-fashion brands because they believe that these products are more ethical. Coates has started shopping more from H&M Conscious and New Look Kind, for this reason. \u201cI want to play my part,\u201d she says.\nBut even these ranges fuel the same monstrous over-consumption. \u201cImpulse-buying something that is made with slightly more sustainable fibres is not going to help,\u201d says Perry. Overgaard tells me that the young people he surveyed \u201clacked awareness of the sustainable alternatives to the products they were consuming from the fast-fashion producers\u201d. Some ethical brands they might wish to consider would be Finisterre, Lucy & Yak, Baukjen, They May Be, Community Clothing, Raeburn, Passenger, Rapanui, Ninety Percent, AYM, Form & Thread and Story MFG.\nWhen it comes down to it, it is unfair to condemn Gen Z for being consumers of fast fashion, when people of all ages keep the system going, or at least fail to challenge it. Gen Z did not create fast fashion and are often funded by their parents, who also sign for the packages. \u201cI can think of millennial parents that allow their kids to buy Shein without ever talking to them about it,\u201d says Barber. The truth is that we should all be held accountable, regardless of age, because we are all complicit. \u201cI don\u2019t think this system is good for anyone,\u201d says Barber. \u201cNot the garment workers. Not the environment. And not the person buying the clothing. This is a bad system that needs to change on all fronts.\u201d",

        "content": "Survey also finds three-quarters are comfortable talking about their own deaths in marked cultural shift\nFor several years Alison lay awake at night wishing her husband dead. Trapped in a miserable marriage, her preference was for a straightforward heart attack or massive stroke. But she also fantasised about a car crash or a fishbone getting stuck in his throat.\n\u201cI thought death would be a good outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d be free, yet everyone would feel sorry for me.\u201d Eventually the couple went through an acrimonious divorce, but both remain in good health.\nAlison\u2019s thoughts may sound extreme but she is among a third of Britons who have seriously wished death upon someone, according to new data. More men than women have harboured such thoughts, and three-quarters said they had no regrets. People were not asked why they wished someone dead.\nThe finding is part of an extensive survey of attitudes to death carried out by YouGov and shared exclusively with the Guardian. It provides a fascinating insight into the range of views held by the public as taboos on talking about death continue to be broken down.\n\u201cThe survey illustrates the misconception that the public doesn\u2019t want to talk about death or dying. People really do \u2013 this is a topic people care about,\u201d said John Troyer of the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath.\nAccording to the poll, almost three-quarters of Britons say they are comfortable talking about their own death \u2013 with over-40s markedly more at ease than younger people. This reflects a cultural shift towards greater openness about terminal illness and grief in recent decades, and an increase in support organisations helping people come to terms with impending death and planning their own funerals.\nPop-up \u201cdeath cafes\u201d have emerged in dozens of countries, drawing in thousands of people to discuss death. Television programmes and books have embraced the issue, sometimes with humour. Debates on assisted dying have raised issues around end-of-life care. Some have suggested that the boomer generation, facing its own mortality, is freeing death from the shackles of taboo in the same way it championed sexual liberation in the 1960s.\nAccording to the poll, almost one in 10 Britons think about death \u2013 their own or in general \u2013 every day, with another 20% thinking about it several times a week. Only 4% say they never think about it. Two-thirds say there are worse things than death, citing living in pain, having a serious incapacitating illness, being tortured, or losing a loved one, particularly a child.\nPeople taking part in the survey were fairly evenly split over fear of dying: 41% said they were afraid, with 43% saying they were not. Young women were most likely to be fearful, and men over 60 least afraid. People who practise a religion were less likely to be fearful than non-religious people \u2013 but not by much: 51% compared with 42%.\nNine percent of people thought they would live beyond their 90th birthday, and 8% thought they would die before reaching 65. The biggest group, a third, expected to die between the ages of 81 and 90.\nAlmost half (49%) have pictured their own funeral, with 8% thinking about it in detail. Cremation is the preferred option for 45%, with only 15% saying they want to be buried and one in eight (13%) saying they would like to donate their body to research.\nA third of Britons believe in an afterlife. Among those, the biggest group (43%) think a soul goes to heaven or lives on in some way, 16% believe in reincarnation, and 6% think they will become a spirit. A majority of those questioned (54%) do not believe in heaven or hell, but 10% of non-religious people believe in both.\nSurprisingly, the Covid pandemic, which by the end of last month had claimed almost 160,000 lives in the UK, has had no impact on a large majority (69%) of people\u2019s perception of death. Among the one in four people who said it had affected the way they viewed death, most had become more worried about losing someone close to them.\nMore than half (56%) said it was acceptable to celebrate or rejoice at someone\u2019s death, with young men significantly more likely to think cheering someone\u2019s demise is OK than any other group. Almost one in four people said someone\u2019s death could never be a cause of celebration.\nThree-quarters said they would be prepared to die to save someone\u2019s life. For one in 10, there is no one for whom they would sacrifice their life.\nYouGov questioned 2,164 UK adults earlier this year",

The employment tribunal\u2019s findings lay bare the misogynistic attitudes and culture within armed policing and the hostile treatment police officers face when they try to call it out.\u201d\nFollowing the judgment, Malone \u2013 who claimed Police Scotland had offered her a payout if she signed a non-disclosure agreement \u2013 said she was \u201cabsolutely delighted at finally obtaining justice\u201d.\nThe tribunal also accepted evidence that Malone\u2019s senior officer, Insp Keith Warhurst, copied her in on an email in January 2018 saying two female firearms officers should not be deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty, referring to \u201cthe obvious differences in physical capacity\u201d and suggesting this made \u201cmore sense from a search, balance of testosterone perspective\u201d.\nBut the tribunal found that Warhurst\u2019s instruction was not carried out, with staff told it did not represent the views of senior management and, as a result of this it dismissed Malone\u2019s direct discrimination claim.\nDescribing Malone as an \u201centirely credible and reliable witness\u201d, the tribunal found that Warhurst posted images of topless women to a WhatsApp group of male sergeants, that two other female officers left the division because they \u201cfelt their sex was always going to be a barrier to promotion\u201d, and that when one woman asked if female firearms officers could wear trousers and a top rather than a one-piece, so that it would be easier to go to the toilet, the chief firearms instructor swore at her.\nMalone told the Guardian that since taking her case she had been approached by many other female officers who had faced similar experiences. \u201cThe unconscious bias in Police Scotland is so deep that they don\u2019t even realise. Misogynist banter is nurtured and no one steps in to say this is wrong. So that poisonous culture is just going to grow.\u201d\nShe said Police Scotland management had a duty to hold other senior officers to account. \u201cThey are promoting the wrong people, and those who speak up are made to look like they are the problem.\u201d\nLast November a review of Scotland\u2019s widely criticised police complaints system by Dame Elish Angiolini, a former lord advocate, heard \u201cvery worrying evidence\u201d of discrimination against female and LGBTQ+ officers, and the mistreatment of black and minority ethnic police officers, concluding that a further, fundamental review of equalities within the force was needed.\nPolice Scotland has been approached for comment.",

Under the Ibac Act, it can be an offence for an individual to confirm they are being examined.\n\u201cIf you want to know what Ibac is doing and who they\u2019re doing it with, then you need to speak to Ibac. I cannot provide you with any other answer,\u201d Andrews told reporters. \u201cI behave appropriately at all times and I\u2019m focused on always doing what is the appropriate thing to do.\u201d\nVictoria\u2019s opposition has called on the premier to resign if his role was being investigated.\n The shadow attorney general, Tim Smith, told reporters: \u201cThe former premier of NSW resigned because she was under investigation by Icac. The premier of Victoria is under investigation by our anti-corruption commission, Ibac, why hasn\u2019t the premier stood down?\u201d\nWhen asked if he would stand down pending the outcome of any Ibac investigation, Andrews replied: \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d.\n \u201cI will not be doing anything other than my duty and what I\u2019m sworn to do and that is to work as hard as I can to deliver on my commitments to the community, keep the community safe and make sure that we can deliver our roadmap to opening,\u201d he said on Wednesday.\n  Ibac refused to comment on the Age report. \u201cAs a matter of practice, Ibac does not comment on whether it has a complaint or investigation before it,\u201d it said in a statement on Wednesday.\nA spokesperson for the UFU also declined to comment.\nThe genesis of the Ibac investigation is a 2014 dispute between the United Firefighters Union and the Country Fire Authority (CFA).\nThe CFA had been concerned that the UFU would be handed undue control over country firefighters under a proposed enterprise bargaining agreement.\nAndrews was elected premier in late 2014 when the brawl was still in its early stages.\nOver the next three years, the dispute became increasingly toxic, claiming Andrews\u2019 emergency services minister, Jane Garrett, and many senior officials in the firefighting services, both the volunteer-based CFA and the professional Metropolitan Fire Brigade.\nAndrews subsequently announced a solution: he would merge the two fire services under a new body now called Fire Rescue Victoria. The move was seen largely as a way of appeasing Marshall and the union.\nBut senior figures within the fire authorities continued to resign as the reforms were pushed through, culminating in the official merger of the services in 2020.\nThe news of Andrews\u2019 involvement in an Ibac investigation came days after the anti-corruption body confirmed it would hold public hearings as part of a separate inquiry into the conduct of former Labor ministers.\nLast Thursday, Ibac confirmed it would hold public hearings as part of its investigation into alleged branch stacking by Adem Somyurek which he denies. Those hearings are due to start on Monday.\n- with Australian Associated Press",

Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to explain exactly what\u2019s so fab about it without spoilers, so just take our word for it as long as you have the stomach for lots of fake blood and jump scares. Suffice to say that Thongkham is nimble when it comes to wrongfooting the viewer, and there\u2019s some pleasingly pointed satire here as well, sticking it to rich, snobby people who think domestic workers are as disposable as empty washing up bottles.\nThe maid of the title is Joy (bob-haired ingenue Ploy Sornarin), a country girl who gets hired to schlep tea trays up and down the stairs in service to super-wealthy Uma (actor-model-singer Savika Chaiyadej), a woman so ridiculously haughty she dresses like a gameshow hostess for breakfast and always uses a cigarette holder \u2013 presumably so the butts don\u2019t touch her lips. Joy has worked out that she\u2019s but the latest in a long line of maids who don\u2019t last long in that household, but when she asks the other servants they get all squirrelly and tell her she\u2019s not to ask any questions.\nAside from tea tray transport, Joy\u2019s other job is looking after Uma\u2019s young daughter Nid (Keetapat Pongrue), a sweet little moppet with a sinister monkey toy that may or may not come to life when no one is looking. But pseudo-simian playthings aren\u2019t all there is to worry about here: there\u2019s another shadowy figure, usually visible only to the audience but also sensed by the characters, who skulks about auguring third-act mayhem once all the backstory has been explained.\nSome viewers may not groove to the film\u2019s lurid melodrama, exaggerated performances and stylised sets and costumes and, as with some other Thai films that have found distribution outside Asia, such as the super-saturated Thai \u201cwestern\u201d Tears of the Black Tiger back in the early 00s, this lies just on the cusp between naivety and camp.

Everyone else would each be permitted up to 12 rented car journeys a year \u2013 in case they need to move house, for example.\nBut is banning cars necessary, and what is wrong with electric vehicles? \u201cWe would need about half of cars to go electric next year in order to meet the federal government\u2019s own targets for transportation emissions,\u201d said Nik Kaestner, from the campaign. \u201cThat clearly isn\u2019t going to happen \u2013 currently only 1.3% of vehicles in Germany are electric. So the only solution is to reduce the amount of driving that\u2019s happening, not just to change how we drive.\u201d\nManuel Wiemann, a spokesperson for the initiative, said cars also polluted through tyre wear, \u201coccupy far too much common space and unnecessarily endanger human lives, whether electric or diesel\u201d.\nA 2014 report commissioned by Berlin\u2019s regional parliament found that 58% of traffic space was devoted to cars, even though only a third of journeys on Berlin streets (and only 17% within the S-Bahn ring) were made by car. Only 3% was set aside for bicycles, which accounted for 15% of journeys (18% within the ring).\nParked cars took up 17 sq km. In total, almost 20 times more space was dedicated to cars than to bicycles in one of Europe\u2019s most renowned cycle-friendly cities. Three-quarters of road deaths are pedestrians or cyclists.\nNina Nobl\u00e9, one of the initiative\u2019s founders, said: \u201cIt\u2019s as much about our immediate environment as it is about the environment at large. It\u2019s about how we all want to live, breathe and play together. We want people to be able to sleep with their windows open, and children to be able to play in the street again. And grandparents should be able to ride their bicycles safely and have plenty of benches to take a breather on.\u201d\nAlthough historically anti-car campaigns in Europe have tended to have very limited success, Berlin Autofrei may prove different. The campaign is using a special form of direct democracy enshrined in the German constitution. Another people\u2019s referendum led to the recent landmark vote to expropriate thousands of houses from Berlin\u2019s biggest landlords.\nIn the first stage of a three-part process, a group must collect the signatures of 20,000 citizens in favour of a proposed law change in a given timeframe. In the second stage, 170,000 signatures must be collected. If the government refuses to implement the law after these two stages, the question is put to a public vote.\nHaving collected 50,333 signatures in the first stage, the campaigners are feeling confident.\n\u201cThe federal environmental ministry did a study recently and 91% of people said they would be happier without a car. Moreover, only a third of individual Berliners actually have a car,\u201d said Kaestner.\nBut he admitted this \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean people will automatically be in favour. If it does get to a final vote, it will be about motivating the base just like in every other tight election.\u201d\nA previous referendum initiative calling for a cycle-friendly mobility law never had to go to a public vote, because the government adopted the proposed law after stage two of the process. There is a possibility that it may do the same with Autofrei, as the Greens will play a significant role in the next governing coalition after their vote share increased to 18.9% in Berlin in September\u2019s elections.\nFor the moment Berlin Autofrei still has a long way to go. But if there was ever a chance for a radical transformation of road space, then when if not now? \u201cAnd where,\u201d said Wiemann, \u201cif not in Berlin?\u201d",

        "content": "French club have already witnessed Challenge Cup success but now they could take the ultimate prize overseas\nWhen Catalans Dragons walk out in their first Super League Grand Final on Saturday evening, those who have been on the French club\u2019s journey since the beginning will perhaps allow themselves a moment to reflect. Every sporting story has a pivotal moment and for Catalans, who are on the verge of creating yet more rugby league history this weekend, that came almost four years ago to the day.\n\u201cI was numb,\u201d says Alex Chan, the club\u2019s chief executive, recalling his emotions from the 2017 Million Pound Game. \u201cI remember everything about it because I knew the consequences if it had gone wrong.\u201d It had been another disappointing season for Catalans, but this time the Dragons were in real danger of relegation from Super League.\nTrailing Leigh at half-time in the play-off to determine which side would drop into the Championship, for a moment the sport\u2019s last great hope of expansion looked to be about to collapse. A sport confined to its northern heartlands was about to lose its bastion of possibility in France.\nHowever, that day ended in relief. Catalans battled back to beat Leigh, securing their place in Super League. Then, just eight months later, they lifted the Challenge Cup at Wembley and, since that day, they have not looked back. But for club stalwarts such as Chan, a Grand Final debut on Saturday has been years in the making.\nThree months before that Million Pound Game, Catalans had appointed the former England coach Steve McNamara as head coach. Tasked with keeping the Dragons in Super League, he was already looking further ahead. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in the best spot when I got there,\u201d McNamara recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask too many questions, simply because I didn\u2019t want to know the answers. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job. But I knew there was potential given the passion the people of Perpignan have for rugby league.\u201d\nMcNamara had inherited a club with deep-rooted culture issues, dating back to the launch of Les Dracs in 2006. \u201cThis is clearly a superb place to live, work and bring your family to experience,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re here to work, and if you\u2019re doing well then you enjoy the lifestyle. For a long time it was the other way around for the overseas players who came.\n\u201cReputations stick. Perceptions stick. We\u2019ve had to work incredibly hard to convince people that it isn\u2019t how it used to be, and we\u2019re not flooding the beach bars in June and July instead of working hard and knuckling down. That was one of the first things we had to tackle, and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\nSlowly but surely, McNamara\u2019s Catalans eroded the notion that a contract in Perpignan doubled up as a holiday or, if you were arriving from the southern hemisphere, a place to wind down your playing career with a lucrative pay cheque. Signings such as Sam and Joel Tomkins, plus established Super League stars such as Michael McIlorum, have gradually shifted the mentality in the south of France.\n\u201cThe appetite in this region for rugby league is huge,\u201d says Joel Tomkins. \u201cEvery village and town has got a club, it\u2019s frighteningly similar to places like Wigan and St Helens in England.\u201d The unwavering support of the owner, Bernard Guasch, who secured Catalans\u2019 entry to Super League in 2007, has been vital.\nBut the Dragons limped along in relative mediocrity, with a raft of big-name overseas signings in the autumn of their career failing to deliver: things needed to change. McNamara\u2019s arrival heralded a fresh approach and, less than a year later, they answered their critics in the summer of 2018 by beating Warrington at Wembley.\n\u201cWe\u2019d been to the Challenge Cup final in 2007 but lost, and before three years ago we were looked upon as a bit of a bridesmaid,\u201d Chan says. \u201cThat day changed rugby league in the UK. My goal has always been to take the game away from just the heartlands and strengthen it. It exploded over here in France after winning the cup, and the snowball effect has been huge.\u201d\nWith an increased investment and focus into developing young French talent \u2013 such as Arthur Mourgue, the livewire full-back or hooker who will feature at Old Trafford \u2013 plus the success of Toulouse, who are overwhelming favourites to join Catalans in Super League in 2022, French rugby league is thriving.\nCatalans finishing top of Super League for the first time was one thing, but a sold-out crowd roaring them to victory against Hull KR last week to secure a maiden Old Trafford appearance is another. Victory in the game\u2019s showpiece stands to elevate its appeal beyond its heartlands in the northern hemisphere.\n\u201cThere are English rugby league clubs who\u2019ve been around for decades who haven\u2019t had the success Catalans have had,\u201d Chan insists. \u201cThis could change the game as we know it. If we can take the league title away from the so-called heartlands and back to Perpignan, I can\u2019t put into words what that could do for rugby league all across the world.\u201d\nMcNamara, whose only previous Grand Final appearance was in 1999 as a player with Bradford Bulls, agrees. \u201cWembley put us on the map. The interest has gone to another level all across France in recent weeks, though. This club is only 16 years in to its story. We have an infrastructure as good as any in Super League.\n\u201cWe have young players as good as any in Super League. Four years ago feels a lifetime ago in some respects, but we\u2019ve worked so hard to reach this point. It\u2019s an historic moment for the sport, not just for Catalans Dragons. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t ask those questions of the board four years ago but now, we\u2019ve got a chance to do something that could change the sport forever. It\u2019s an honour to be part of it.\u201d",

Children have already been waiting far too long to have their rights properly protected. Finding a way to address the issues raised and return the bill to the Scottish parliament must be a priority for Scottish government.\u201d\nAnnouncing the ruling, Lord Reed said the court agreed that two bills \u2013 which incorporate treaties on children\u2019s rights and local government in Scots law and were unanimously backed by MSPs before May\u2019s Holyrood election \u2013 could affect Westminster\u2019s ability to make laws for Scotland, in breach of the Scotland Act.\nWhile UK law officers insisted their challenge was not based on the substance of the legislation, both bills must now return to Holyrood for a \u201creconsideration stage\u201d to bring them into line with the court\u2019s ruling.\nChildren and young people\u2019s groups called on the Scottish government to get on with the job. Josh Kennedy, the chair of the Scottish youth parliament, said: \u201cThe onus is now on the Scottish government to address the judgment made by the supreme court and work to bring forward a revised bill to parliament as soon as possible.\u201d\nJuliet Harris, of Together, the Scottish Alliance for Children\u2019s Rights, coordinated a response from 65 organisations urging the Scottish government to address the court\u2019s concerns quickly.\nShe said: \u201cScotland\u2019s children and young people have been campaigning for this for decades, so to have this final hurdle is extremely frustrating. The Scottish government should proceed at pace to address today\u2019s judgment with the maximalist approach to incorporation \u2013 one that takes every step possible within the powers of the Scottish parliament to protect children\u2019s rights \u2013 that every party at Holyrood supported.\u201d\nIn a statement to Holyrood on Wednesday afternoon, Swinney told MSPs the ruling was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said his government remained \u201cabsolutely committed to the incorporation of the [convention] to the maximum extent possible\u201d.",

The inquest heard that Port was also found guilty of the drugging and sexual assault of seven living victims at his Old Bailey trial. Richards said that in addition, there were between five and seven other living victims identified by police who did not wish to take part in the prosecution.\nAsked if police could be certain Port had not murdered more people, Richards said: \u201cWe had to be 100% sure that he hadn\u2019t killed anyone else\u201d. He added that \u201cextensive inquiries\u201d had been made and police had reviewed 58 or 59 other deaths to see if there was any connection, but had found none.\nThe long-awaited inquests, held at Barking town hall, will examine whether the series of police investigations into the men\u2019s murders were adequate and whether lives could have been saved.\nRichards described Port\u2019s pornography obsession as \u201cabsolutely incessant\u201d.\n\u201cIt was all day, every day,\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThere were hundreds of thousands of lines of messages.\u201d Port would watch \u201ca considerable and extensive amount\u201d of drug rape material, viewing it for hours at a time on his laptop. He had a real obsession with drug rape pornography.\u201d\nPort would pause messaging or watching the footage for about half an hour to go and meet men at Barking railway station and bring them back to his flat, then would continue viewing the material once the men were in his home.\nPort disposed of his phone handset or sim card after each of the deaths, Richards said.\nHe would never reveal his address online when messaging men, but instead preferred to met them at Barking station then take them back to his nearby flat, Richards said.\nPolice still did not know how he had dumped his victims\u2019 bodies, but believed that Port, who was described as 6ft 5ins and of big build, had wrapped them in bed sheets and carried them to the nearby sites where they were found.\nThe inquests, which are expected to last up to 10 weeks, continue.",

It\u2019s a boast, of sorts: far from being cowed by the criticism (including transphobia and homophobia) of previous specials, he\u2019s tripling down on that hot-potato content. After a palate-cleanser about his brush with coronavirus, the show mainlines our host\u2019s relationship with women, transgender people and \u201cthe LGBTQ community\u201d. He cracks abusive jokes about all of them, but this isn\u2019t \u201cpunching down\u201d, insists Chappelle who sees all these groups as more privileged than, and often racist against, black people.\nIs there, in this tangle of shit-stirring, accusation and special pleading, any space left for light-heartedness? Plenty, if you\u2019re Chappelle\u2019s Detroit audience, who not only chuckle at but cheer his charmless tale of beating up a lesbian in a nightclub. But I found the show heavy going.\nI respect Chappelle\u2019s refusal to let matters lie, and one can imagine the good, knotty show \u2013 confronting the blind spots within and between modern gender and racial thinking \u2013 that his truculence might have engendered. But The Closer only occasionally gets close. Regarding his transphobia, we find a friend warning Chappelle: \u201cCareful Dave, they after you\u201d. Replies Dave: \u201cOne they or many theys?\u201d That\u2019s amusing enough as a standalone joke, and so too, sometimes, is the self-irony in which Chappelle drenches his supposed status as a \u201ctransphobic comedian\u201d.\nThe trouble is, the phobic jokes keep coming \u2013 and Chappelle\u2019s efforts to ironise them, to dance around rather than wallow in the boorishness, are derisory. They\u2019re often plain weak, like the predictable \u201csuck my dick\u201d punchline to his joke about feminism needing male leadership.\nIn practice, The Closer toggles between two modes: aggressive gags about Chappelle\u2019s antagonists, and feeble protests that he never said anything prejudiced in the first place. There\u2019s also much self-regarding commentary on how brave he\u2019s being. \u201cOh buddy I\u2019m in trouble now,\u201d says the man who was Emmy-nominated for, and won America\u2019s prestigious Mark Twain prize, after his last round of anti-trans humour. He ends promising no more jokes about LGBTQ+ people \u201cuntil we\u2019re sure we\u2019re both laughing together\u201d. On this evidence, that may be a long time coming.\n Dave Chappelle: The Closer is on Netflix.",

        "content": "Spill off California coast will be difficult to clear from areas that are home to diverse array of birds and endangered plants and animals\nThe full scale of the ecological damage from the Huntington Beach oil spill will take some time to become clear, with birds and marine mammals hardest hit in the short term.\nThat\u2019s the view of experts with experience of other incidents as they consider a suspected underwater pipe leak that spilled roughly 126,000 gallons of crude oil just miles off the southern Californian coast.\n\u201cThe recovery is going to be very uneven,\u201d Steve Murawski, a fisheries biologist and marine ecologist at the University of South Florida, said.\nDead birds and fish reportedly washed up along the miles of black-splotched shore as rescue workers rushed to recover oiled animals. Seven birds have been saved from the scene and another, a pelican, had to be euthanized. So far, there are no official reports tallying fatalities of animals or invertebrates.\nMurawski has spent years studying the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill \u2013 the largest offshore spill in US history, which dumped 134m gallons into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days in 2010, contaminating 1,300 miles across five states. Thousands of animals perished in that spill and the effects can still be seen and felt today, more than a decade later.\nThe situation unfolding in Huntington Beach is not on the same scale as the Deepwater Horizon disaster but there are still important takeaways and lessons learned, Murawski said.\nHe said birds and marine mammals will be harmed, especially those that congregate along southern California\u2019s offshore islands or pass through its coastal wetlands. Smaller creatures like plankton could take a hit, but their fast lifecycle will likely ensure they bounce back quickly. \u201cThe longer alive and the slower growing things, like abalone and other things that can\u2019t get out of the way,\u201d he said, \u201cthat might be more problematic.\u201d\nThe effects could be felt long after the sand is cleared of the black sludge, especially in the affected marshes and wetlands \u2013 critical habitats for migratory and shorebirds and several endangered species.\nResearchers have found that oil deposits don\u2019t always float. Tar balls can find their way into underwater sediment or collect against sand banks where the waves crest near the shore, complicating cleanup efforts. Winter storms may continue to drudge up contamination long after the spill is contained.\n\u201cYou will have to go through a number of rounds of beach cleanup and every time you have a storm you are going to see those tar balls back up on the beach,\u201d Murawski said, noting that British Petroleum, the company responsible for Deepwater Horizon, was pulling up huge nets of tar and sand for years after the disaster. \u201cI would imagine that that\u2019s going to be a persistent headache for the people who are supposed to clean the beach up.\u201d\nClearing oil from the sand and surface waters is a somewhat straightforward process, but it gets far more complex in the delicate marshes and wetlands. These areas, which arehome to a diverse array of species including migratory birds and endangered plants and animals, might be permanently affected by the oil spill.\n\u201cOnce the oil is in the marsh and it gets down below the level of the sediments,\u201d Murawski said, \u201cit is there pretty much forever.\u201d\nOil has already seeped into three marshes operated by the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, a local nonprofit that restored them to the refuges they are now. \u201cIt is heartbreaking,\u201d said John Villa, the executive director, lamenting the efforts he and others have gone through to keep their 127 acres of preserves pristine.\nAfter hearing reports of the spill on Saturday, he jumped into action, trying to stop the spread of the sheen at the shoreline. He and Orange county public works officials created a berm out of sand to block the contaminated water from entering the marshes \u2013 but it was too late. \u201cSome of the oil still came in and it is still seeping in,\u201d he said, adding that they are working to clean the water to the best of their ability.\nThe Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, which includes the Talbert, Brookhurst, Magnolia and Newland marshes, cultivates a rich biodiversity. Between 85 and 90 species of birds call the wetlands home or stop there along their migratory routes, 10% of which are on the endangered or threatened species list, according to Villa. The organization also created a space where endangered plant species can thrive.\nBut over the weekend, the sheen could be seen in the shallows. Eelgrass, once growing in the water, was dead and floating to the sides. Villa is unsure about what the impact will be going forward, as more birds make their way into the area. Thousands of birds migrate through or overwinter in the area, including brown pelicans, Pacific loons, ospreys, and federally endangered western snowy plovers, who breed on the beaches, according to Audubon California.\nAlong with cleanup, there are concerns about how long the inlet can stay blocked before fish and plants in the marsh start to become starved of oxygen brought in salt water flows from the ocean. \u201cDo we open up the inlet, which means we could get more contaminated salt water in there?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a careful dance.\u201d\nIt only takes a tiny amount of exposure for a seabird to succumb, according to researchers. In a 2020 report on the effects on the Refugio Beach Oil Spill \u2013 which occurred in 2015 after a pipeline ruptured and poured more than 100,000 gallons of crude near Santa Barbara \u2013 researchers found that all it takes is an amount the size of a nickel to kill some species that forage in the water.\n\u201cLike a hole in a wetsuit, the oil destroys the feathers\u2019 ability to insulate the bird, thus allowing cold ocean water to spread against the bird\u2019s skin,\u201d the report said. \u201cBirds that contact oil typically die of hypothermia and starvation.\u201d Because many birds preen, using their beaks to clean their feathers, they are also at higher risk of ingesting the toxins. Others may be rendered immobile if their feathers are smothered in sticky substance.\nResearchers documented close to 560 bird deaths in the aftermath of the Refugio Beach Oil spill, spanning 28 different species. The actual toll is believed to be even higher.\nSome populations of birds were affected not by deaths but by births. The western snowy plovers \u2013 tiny, rotund, endangered dune-dwellers \u2013 were exposed on the beach or when foraging in contaminated shallows or around washed-up kelp. In the first breeding season after the spill, scientists noted their egg infertility rate quadrupled and close to 10% of eggs were unviable.\nHundreds of invertebrates \u2013 from hermit crabs to sea stars \u2013 perished in that spill as well.\nThe extent of the ecological damage from the 2015 spill has only recently begun to come into focus and researchers expect the impact from this new spill may also take years to understand.\n\u201cIt is really impossible to effectively clean up an oil spill,\u201d said Miyoko Sakashita, director of the the advocacy organization Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s oceans program, adding that she was devastated to see the oil reach sensitive habitats. \u201cBirds migrate through there and use it for nesting and resting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to have longstanding impacts on a lot of the animals \u2013 we are going to see oil damaging beaches and ecosystems for many years to come.\u201d",

The measure means Wales or Ireland would have to change jerseys if drawn to play against each other in the tournament or in future fixtures.\nMore than 300 million people worldwide suffer from some form of CVD. The condition is far more prevalent in men, with around one in 12 globally affected by the condition compared to one in 200 women. Red-green colour-blindness is the most common form and is experienced by around 8% of male rugby fans and 0.5% of female supporters.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, if you\u2019re potentially limiting eight per cent of your male audience, that\u2019s a huge number of people who are suddenly switching off,\u201d World Rugby\u2019s research, turf and equipment manager Marc Douglas told the i newspaper.\nWorld Rugby has identified seven main areas which can be challenging for people who are colour-blind. These are kit clashes, equipment colours, stadium and ticket information, TV coverage, workplace issues and external information such as sponsorship and emergency services.\nSir Bill Beaumont, chairman of World Rugby had announced new measures on last month\u2019s Colour Blind Awareness Day, saying: \u201cColour-blindness is largely misunderstood and the challenges for those who play, coach, officiate and support our sport is often overlooked.\n\u201cAs someone who experiences those challenges first hand, I am delighted that World Rugby is marking Colour Blind Awareness Day 2021 by launching comprehensive guidance for all levels of the game that place visually-impaired considerations at the heart of our decision-making.\n\u201cThrough this guidance, we hope to raise awareness and change culture through positive actions that don\u2019t just address some of the more obvious challenges such as kit colours, but consider the whole match-day experience whether that be wayfinding, digital signage, branding or ticketing.\u201d\nHighlighting the problem of sufferers, Scottish Rugby ambassador, Chris Paterson, said: \u201cI remember playing at night-time when we played for Edinburgh and Scarlets would come up in their dark red. I remember a couple of times making a line-break on a counter attack, running into what I thought was space between two of my own men and just getting totally smashed.\n\u201cYour focus is on the ball, you\u2019re running and scanning the whole time \u2026 [it\u2019s] because there\u2019s not that real clear division in our eyes, I suppose.\u201d",

        "content": "The PM aimed to buoy Tory activists despite concerns over inflation and national insurance\nBoris Johnson let the bombast flow as he delivered a speech designed to buoy Tory activists despite their nerves about the forthcoming national insurance increase and the risk of dangerously high levels of inflation.\nIn a specially constructed auditorium, the prime minister announced only one new policy \u2013 spending the remainder of his 45-minute address fleshing out in colour and tone how he plans to hold on to the swathes of voters who voted Conservative for the first time at the last election and meandering between some of his other favourite subjects.\nThis is what he said \u2013 and its significance:\nWe have one of the most imbalanced societies and lopsided economies of all the richer countries. It is not just that there is a gap between London and the south-east and the rest of the country: there are aching gaps within the regions themselves.\u201d\nJohnson knew the pressure was on to start implementing what some Tories say is a nebulous concept that has not been fleshed out in the nearly two years since the last election. He chose not to \u2013 given the white paper on levelling up is expected to be produced within months and also mindful of saving some fanfare for the budget and spending review. Unlike the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who used his speech this week to effusively pay tribute to his Tory predecessors\u2019 management of public finances, Johnson instead took aim at prime ministers over the past few decades \u2013 including three Conservatives \u2013 in an effort to disassociate himself from their austerity drive, and reinvent the party. Johnson specifically name-checked Buckinghamshire as a region that has been levelled up \u2013 a careful choice, given it was home to the Chesham and Amersham constituency where a huge Tory majority was overturned at the byelection in June.\nWhen this country was sick, our NHS was the nurse. Frontline healthcare workers battled against a new disease, selflessly risking their lives, sacrificing their lives. And it is right that this party \u2013 that has looked after the NHS for most of its history \u2013 should be the one to rise to the challenge.\nThe Conservatives have always claimed to be safe stewards of the NHS and Johnson clearly tried to take this narrative further. He understands its salience to Labour voters and wants to be seen to praise it, particularly in the light of Covid. Recalling his own personal experience being hospitalised with Covid in March 2020, Johnson wanted to show he had an emotional connection with one of the nation\u2019s most beloved institutions. However, he sought to manage expectations, also admitting that waiting lists will go up before they come down.\nIt has become clear to me that this isn\u2019t just a joke \u2013 they really do want to rewrite our national story, starting with Hereward the Woke. We really are at risk of a kind of know-nothing cancel culture, know-nothing iconoclasm. We Conservatives will defend our history and cultural inheritance not because we are proud of everything, but because trying to edit it now is as dishonest as a celebrity trying furtively to change his entry in Wikipedia, and it\u2019s a betrayal of our children\u2019s education.\nJohnson threw his supporters some red meat by signalling he was seriously concerned about the creep of culture wars \u2013 though seemed to blame the \u201cwoke\u201d re-examination of historical figures for this, rather than allies on his own side stoking the flames. Some Conservatives feel that they have a better chance of captivating disaffected former Labour voters by appearing in step with them on social issues \u2013 be it statues, trans rights or taking the knee \u2013 so Johnson showed he is not afraid to plough this furrow further.\nIt was the private sector that made it possible. Behind those vaccines are companies and shareholders and, yes, bankers. You need deep pools of liquidity that are to be found in the City of London. It was capitalism that ensured that we had a vaccine in less than a year and the answer therefore is not to attack the wealth creators, it is to encourage them \u2013 because they are responsible for the aggregate increase in the country\u2019s wealth that enables us to make those Pareto improvements.\nAware of the fragile coalition of voters he must hold together \u2013 traditional low-tax Tories and newer supporters who want higher public spending \u2013 Johnson was at this point speaking to the former. His full-throated defence of capitalism and praise of bankers was meant to encourage wealth creators to stick with the party, and probably help top up its coffers with donations. However, the prime minister\u2019s lavish praise for the private sector in helping produce the AstraZeneca vaccine was notably more restrained than comments he made in private to Tory MPs earlier this year, when he credited \u201cgreed\u201d.\nTired old Labour \u2026 Did you watch them last week in Brighton? Hopelessly divided, I thought they looked, their leader like a seriously rattled bus conductor, pushed this way and that \u2026 by a Corbynista mob of Sellotape-spectacled sans-culottes. Or the skipper of a cruise liner that has been captured by Somali pirates desperately trying to negotiate a change of course and then changing his mind.\nJohnson is most in his element when he\u2019s insulting the opposition \u2013 reaching for the most bizarre and colourful metaphor that will leave supportive spectators howling. To keep up the energy in the room, the prime minister reached for ever-more odd descriptions of Keir Starmer. But his more serious intention was to try to brand Starmer as hamstrung by his party and therefore unreliable on policy \u2013 subject to the whims of divided Labour members.\nWhen I became leader of this party, there were only \u2013 can you remember what percentage of households had gigabit broadband when you were so kind as to make me leader? Only 7%. And by the new year that will be up to 68%. Thanks to Rishi\u2019s super-deduction, the pace is now accelerating massively as companies thrust the fibre-optic vermicelli in the most hard-to-reach places.\nThe single most important message Johnson wanted to hammer home was that the government has been delivering on pledges made in 2019, despite the obvious distraction of dealing with Covid. Tories are restless when it comes to the rollout of gigabit broadband \u2013 aware that in an increasingly digital age, the difference in internet speed significantly holds back some parts of the country more than others. Pointing to the success that has been achieved in bringing that gap was one of the key ways Johnson tried to demonstrate ministers were \u2013 in the words of the conference\u2019s slogan \u2013 \u201cgetting on with the job\u201d.\nDoes anyone seriously imagine that we should not now be raising the funding to sort this out? Is that really the view of responsible Conservatives? I can tell you something \u2013 Margaret Thatcher would not have ignored this meteorite that has just crashed through the public finances. She would have wagged her finger and said more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later.\nCiting the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher is usually a guaranteed way at Conservative conference to get a rip-roaring round of applause, and Johnson reached for that to try to defend raising national insurance to pay for getting through the NHS backlog and social care. Despite professing himself to be a low-tax Tory, Johnson knows many of his MPs believe he has abandoned \u201cConservatism\u201d \u2013 so what better way to try to paper over that than by invoking Thatcher, who redefined the term herself?",

If we had succumbed to pressure of foreign countries objecting the construction of the Russian pipeline we would have had problems this winter, with no more gas for Serbia coming via Beregovo.\u201d\nVu\u010di\u0107, a one-time minister for information in Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s Yugoslav government, added: \u201cThey [European countries] have run out of their supplies, and did not sign long-term purchase deals with the Russians, and now Putin is the absolute \u2018kingmaker\u2019, with the possibility to decide who [will buy] at what price, and how a price should be raised.\u201d\nThe price of European gas contracts for delivery in November hit record highs this week, rising by 23% to \u20ac117.50 (\u00a399.80) a megawatt hour, up from \u20ac18 six months ago.\nEU leaders \u201creaffirmed\u201d in a post-summit communique that they were committed to enlargement of the bloc but unceremoniously ditched a proposal made by the Slovenian government to put a 2030 deadline on accession of the western Balkans six \u2013 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.\nVu\u010di\u0107 said he had no regrets over his foreign policy choices.\nHe said: \u201cI have no illusions about a quick accession to the EU. The political needs of the EU are such that Balkan enlargement is neither a dominant nor a popular issue.\u201d\nThe comments fuelled concerns in Brussels that the EU\u2019s reticence in acting on its rhetoric on enlargement is pushing prospective member states towards systemic rivals.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, repeated that the western Balkans six were destined to be part of the EU but she conceded that there was growing \u201cfrustration\u201d.\nIn the communique by the 27 member states, the EU offered an \u201cunprecedented\u201d \u20ac30bin economic investment package for the region \u2013 but also added an appeal.\n\u201cThe EU is by far the region\u2019s closest partner, main investor and principal donor,\u201d they said. \u201cThe unprecedented scale and range of this support must be fully recognised and conveyed by the partners in their public debate and communication.\u201d\nThe European council president Charles Michel admitted at the end of the summit that the EU was divided over whether it has the \u201ccapacity\u201d to take on further member states.\nSceptical governments include the French and Dutch, who want to focus on improving the current institutions and decision-making, although French president Emmanuel Macron offered an olive branch by suggesting there should be a discernible \u201cpathway\u201d to accession.\nFormal talks with North Macedonia and Albania were due to start in 2019 but are being held up. Bulgaria has been blackballing talks with North Macedonia due to a dispute over history and language.\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, said that if EU promises failed to be fulfilled, \u201cpeople in the Western Balkans will feel big disappointment that will create huge damage to the European idea of unity and cooperation\u201d.\nVon der Leyen conceded that the failure to progress on the accession of North Macedonia was damaging the EU\u2019s credibility.\nKosovo\u2019s prime minister, Albin Kurti, also expressed his frustration at the slow rate of progress. \u201cIt has been a great injustice, a lack of fairness towards citizens of our country,\u201d Kurti said, noting that five EU member states still did not recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state. \u201cI advocate for a lack of fear on the EU\u2019s side, and a lack of bitterness on the side of the Balkans. I am still hopeful.\u201d\nSebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s chancellor, said: \u201cIf the European Union does not offer this region a real perspective, we have to be aware that other superpowers \u2013 China, Russia or Turkey \u2013 will play a bigger role there. The region belongs to Europe geographically, and it needs a European perspective.\u201d",

        "content": "Greens and liberals say they are willing to enter formal coalition talks with Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic party\nOlaf Scholz has come a step closer to succeeding Angela Merkel as German chancellor after the Greens and liberals announced their readiness to enter formal coalition talks with his Social Democratic party (SPD).\nScholz, who is also the serving finance minister, welcomed the agreement, triggered by an invitation from the Greens to the Free Democrats (FDP) for the three parties to start talks on Thursday. It makes the prospect of a centre-left government replacing the centre-right-led one which has been in power for 16 years more likely than at any time since the 26 September election.\nScholz said the talks would focus on forming a government which would \u201cbring about progress and the necessary modernisation in Germany\u201d and added he was \u201cgrateful for the very professional and serious manner in which the Greens and the FDP have expedited the formation of a government\u201d.\nThe Greens\u2019 co-leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, called an impromptu press conference earlier on Wednesday morning at which they declared their willingness to enter serious negotiations, 10 days after the national election.\nChristian Lindner of the FDP followed about an hour later with a declaration before journalists that he had accepted the Greens\u2019 invitation. He said his party would not be holding parallel talks with the Christian Democrats (CDU) whose leader, Armin Laschet, has not given up his hopes of succeeding Merkel.\nNo party won an overall majority in the 26 September election, but the SPD narrowly beat the outgoing chancellor\u2019s conservatives for first place.\nHabeck said the Greens \u201cdo not want to play an artificial poker game\u201d and that owing to the \u201clarge amount of content overlap\u201d between the parties, they were therefore \u201cproposing to the FDP to approach the SPD together and from there to move from an exploratory negotiation phase to one of three-way talks\u201d.\nHe admitted there were many areas in which the parties had to find agreement. \u201cMany things have yet to be discussed,\u201d he said.\nBaerbock said that with a three-way coalition, the first on the federal level, Germany would be \u201clearning a new form of politics\u201d.\nLindner, appearing slightly caught off-guard, signalled that the impetus for reform was what gave his party and the Greens the biggest motivation for making a coalition work.\n\u201cWe have accepted the suggestion to talk to the SPD,\u201d he said. \u201cDue to the common understanding that this country needs reform, this common interest [between the FDP and Greens] has emerged, despite the differences between us.\u201d He said he was hopeful the sense of urgency could lead to a \u201cprogress-friendly focal point \u2026 which will trigger the powers of imagination\u201d.\nLaschet has refused to bow to pressure from within his own party to relinquish the idea of being able to form a government under his leadership. \u201cWe have signalled that we are ready to hold further talks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the decision as to which order one chooses to speak to whom, lies with the FDP and Greens.\u201d\nBut Markus S\u00f6der, head of the CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, appeared more willing to concede defeat.\n\u201cA clear direction has been decided on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CSU respects this decision. The new government is not yet decided on for sure, but the Union will not stand around on the back burner.\u201d\nIn the past week the four main parties have pursued a flurry of two-way confidential talks, prompting a large degree of speculation and rumour, fuelled in part by leaks from within the CDU of behind-the-scenes discussions, which drew widespread condemnation from across the parties.\nOn Tuesday the possibility of a coalition between the CDU, Greens and FDP, considered far less likely based on the election results, was given a degree of momentum after the Greens and CDU leadership concluded a two-hour discussion by saying talks had been constructive and would continue.\nBut by clearly signalling their direction of travel on Wednesday, the Greens have given the talks a focus they had lacked until now.\nThe Social Democrats secured 25.7% of the vote, the CDU 24.1%, the Greens 14.8% and the FDP 11.5% in last month\u2019s election, making the Greens and FDP kingmakers in any potential coalition.\nIn polls before and since, Germans have consistently said their preference is for a so-called \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition between the SPD, Greens and FDP, whose trademark colours are red, green and yellow respectively.\nA \u201cJamaica coalition\u201d of the CDU, Greens and FDP \u2013 their party colours coinciding with those of the Jamaican flag \u2013 is, while a mathematical possibility, far less popular.\nHowever, FDP leaders said a Jamaica coalition should not be ruled out in the case that traffic light talks stalled.\nA repeat of the grand coalition between the CDU and SPD, which has governed Germany for 12 of the past 16 years under the chancellor, Angela Merkel, is seen as an administration of last resort that has very little public backing.\nHowever, there remains a high degree of wariness at this stage as to whether talks will lead to a successful conclusion, owing to the months of heated wrangling between the CDU, Greens and FDP after the last election in 2017, which ended in stalemate. It took about six months after the election for the grand coalition government to be formed.\nThis time around all the main parties have been at pains to stress the need for urgency. Huge challenges face Europe\u2019s largest economy, not least how to drive a post-pandemic recovery at the same time as catching up with digitalisation and taking a global lead in pursuing innovative, sustainable and economically viable policies to tackle the climate emergency.\nThe first round of talks between the three viable coalition partners, the so-called Ampelsondierungen \u2013 literally \u201ctraffic light probings\u201d \u2013 are expected to begin on Thursday.\nMerkel, who has been in power since 2005, will continue in a caretaker role as German leader until a new government is in place.",

        "content": "Court judgments reveal how Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s use of Pegasus spyware against his ex-wife was uncovered\nEleven court judgments, covering 181 pages, plus hundreds of other pages of legal documents have revealed an extraordinary spying scandal: state-sponsored mobile phone hacking conducted on behalf of the ruler of Dubai against his fearful sixth and former wife, Princess Haya, Britain\u2019s most famous divorce lawyer and her associate, plus three others \u2013 against the backdrop of a bitter child protection battle being played out day after day in the English courts.\nThe conclusion, after just over a year of intense and costly legal arguments, is that \u201cservants or agents\u201d of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, engaged in \u201cthe surveillance of the six phones\u201d in Britain using technology supplied by Israel\u2019s NSO Group, a company already embroiled in a string of hacking scandals, apparently to further his cause in the welfare battle.\n\u201cThe surveillance occurred with the express or implied authority of the father,\u201d writes the judge Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family court, in one key ruling \u2013 although the stark conclusion he made was challenged again and again by Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s lawyers, trying to argue the court had no right to find against a foreign ruler, or that it could not prove the hacking had taken place.\nEach time, the sheikh\u2019s lawyers were defeated, until the final permissions to appeal again to the supreme court were refused.\nYet, according to the judgments released on Wednesday, the story of how the phone hacking was discovered is remarkable in itself. It starts with the work of a digital detective, a specialist in computer forensics, but brings in Cherie Blair, a successful QC and wife of the former prime minister Tony, into an already acrimonious court battle that began after Princess Haya, half-sister to King Abdullah II of Jordan, fled to London in May 2019 with her two children as her marriage to Sheikh Mohammed began to fall apart.\nWilliam Marczak, an expert in the use of mobile phone surveillance software by nation states, had been monitoring the use of NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware around the world. Pegasus is sold by NSO only to governments, ostensibly for use against terrorists and organised criminals. The software has the power to remotely take control of a person\u2019s phone, secretly reading and downloading data and even covertly turning on the microphone to record nearby conversations. In some cases the owner of the phone does not even need to click a link to be infected.\nBut a repeated accusation is that Pegasus has been misused by countries against a far wider range of targets \u2013 including journalists and dissidents. The claims are normally denied by the company. For some time, Marczak had been examining signs of unusual activity on the phones of Middle East human rights campaigners, many of whom had fled abroad, and had been focusing on a phone belonging to \u201ca UAE activist\u201d known only to the English courts as Mr X.\nPegasus is normally deleted after use. But Marczak had found telltale signs of its activity.\nOnce a target phone has been infected, Pegasus is directed by \u201ccommand and control messages\u201d. These are sent to the hacked device from remote servers which \u201cin common with any other internet connected device, have its own individual IP address\u201d, a judgment explains.\nLinking the activity of Pegasus to internet addresses allowed the researcher to spot something surprising: it wasn\u2019t just Mr X who was being targeted \u2013 but also another internet address linked to a prestigious British law firm, Payne Hicks Beach (PHB).\nIts star lawyer is Fiona Shackleton, who had represented Prince Charles in his divorce from Diana and Paul McCartney when he split from Heather Mills. It was no surprise that PHB\u2019s best known partner had been retained by Princess Haya as she battled with her ex-husband; but what would have been surprising was what happened on 5 August last year.\nVia an intermediary, Lady Shackleton was informed of Marczak\u2019s concern that \u201csomeone at PHB\u201d was \u201cbeing possibly targeted by UAE directed spyware\u201d. But it was not the only warning that Shackleton received \u2013 because on the evening of the same day, 5 August, Shackleton was also contacted by Blair, who was passing on another warning of mobile phone surveillance.\nThe second warning was more specific.\nBlair, a successful barrister who carried on practising as much as she could when her husband was prime minister, had stepped up her professional activities again after leaving Downing Street, starting a law firm, Omnia Strategy. Recent work included acting as an adviser to NSO Group, a company repeatedly embroiled in ethical crises, on business and human rights matters. Well into the evening, according to one of the judgments, Blair\u2019s phone rang.\nOn the line \u2013 \u201cat nearly midnight Israeli time\u201d \u2013 was a \u201csenior member of the management team of NSO Group\u201d with a message to pass on.\nThe senior manager is not named by McFarlane, but he recounts what Blair was told: \u201cIt had come to the attention of NSO that their software may have been misused to monitor the mobile phone of Baroness Shackleton and her client, Her Royal Highness Princess Haya.\u201d Blair made contact with Shackleton to pass on the information; the alarm was raised and it quickly became clear that the hacking allegation would form part of the welfare battle, whose truth would have to be determined by the courts.\nShortly after Princess Haya had fled to Britain, in May 2019, she became embroiled in the legal battle over their two children, the youngest of Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s 25 from six marriages. Suspicions between them grew rapidly and Haya had already successfully argued, in front of the family court, that there were questions to be raised about the sheikh\u2019s treatment of two of his other daughters.\nOne of whom, Shamsa, McFarlane determined, was abducted from the UK in August 2000 after she had tried to separate from her family. Another daughter, Latifa, the court concluded, had been captured by Indian commandos on a yacht 30 miles (48km) off the coast of Goa, where she had fled in an attempt to escape Dubai.\nThe sensational ruling was issued in November 2019, but not made public until March of the following year. Sheikh Mohammed said it told only \u201cone side of the story\u201d but Haya was already saying she was the victim of a \u201ccampaign of fear and intimidation\u201d before the phone hacking had taken place.\nSomething of Haya\u2019s fear of her ex-husband and his agents can be seen in another of the judgments released on Wednesday from McFarlane, who made his findings on the balance of probabilities, the standard of proof for civil courts.\nIt described how Haya had learned that agents acting for Sheikh Mohammed were seeking to buy a property near Windsor that overlooked a house she owned nearby, which had been left to her by her father, King Hussein of Jordan. Eventually, last November, \u201cthose acting for the father [Sheikh Mohammed]\u201d indicated the purchase of the house would not go ahead \u2013 but even so, Haya\u2019s fears remained.\nA passage from her witness statement, cited in a judgment made in December last year, sums up her mood.\nBy this time, the phone-hacking allegations were also being considered by the court. \u201cIt feels like the walls are closing in on me, that I cannot protect the children and that we are not safe anywhere. I feel like I am defending myself against a whole \u2018state\u2019. Even in our own home they will be towering over us,\u201d Haya told the court, which in turn ruled that Sheikh Mohammed or his agents could not buy the adjoining property or enter a restricted zone surrounding her own property \u2013 or even the airspace to a ground level of 1,000ft above it.\nMeanwhile, the phone-hacking battle was ongoing. At first, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s legal team argued the English courts had no jurisdiction because any alleged hacking was \u201ca foreign act of state\u201d. The claim was thrown out by both the high court last October and again by the court of appeal in February. During those hearings, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s lawyers said \u201cin relation to intelligence or security matters\u201d it was the UAE\u2019s policy to \u201cneither confirm or deny\u201d what practices it engaged with.\nUltimately, however, as the high court concluded, it was the court\u2019s duty to make a decision: \u201cA decision to abstain from adjudicating on these allegations would seem to us to undercut the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\nSheikh Mohammed\u2019s legal team then sought to challenge the conclusions of Marczak, who first raised concerns. The court appointed its own independent expert, Alastair Beresford, professor of computer security at the University of Cambridge, who validated Marczak\u2019s conclusions in evidence accepted by the court. There was \u201ca unanimity of opinion between them\u201d, McFarlane concluded.\nThat was endorsed, too, by statements made by NSO to the court, an effective admission by the company that it believed its software had been misused to target both Princess Haya and Shackleton.\nIn a letter to the court, NSO said on 4 August 2020 it had become \u201caware of a possible use of the technology by a customer that was not in accordance with the contractual terms applicable to it\u201d and that \u201cinformation was provided to NSO that raised the possibility that Baroness Shackleton\u2019s mobile phone, that of another unnamed member of her firm and that of her client (the Respondent Mother), may have been compromised\u201d.\nNSO told the court it had terminated its contract with \u201cthe customer\u201d \u2013 a state, most likely Dubai rather than the whole UAE.\nWhether there were any wider political repercussions is not recorded in the court papers. The UAE, a federation of seven emirates, remains a close political ally of the UK, with its ruler, Mohammed bin Zayed, being received by Boris Johnson in Downing Street in September. Although a few months earlier, the Guardian reported that the UAE, including Dubai, had already been linked to 400 Britons whose UK mobile phone numbers appeared in a leaked list of numbers identified in the Pegasus project leak and believed to indicate persons of interest selected by government clients of NSO.\nTaken together, McFarlane concluded the evidence was compelling: \u201cI therefore find that all six of these phones have either been successfully infiltrated, or at least the subject of an attempted infiltration, by surveillance software. I find that the software used was NSO\u2019s Pegasus software.\u201d\nAs much as 265 megabytes of data was secretly extracted from Princess Haya\u2019s phone last summer, the judge noted, a demonstration of the power of the technology.\nAs for who did it, the conclusions were clear in the judge\u2019s mind, despite efforts from Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s legal team to suggest that other nations, from Israel to Saudi Arabia and in particular Jordan, might have been responsible. \u201cFirstly, it is obvious that the father, above any other person in the world, is the probable originator of the hacking. No other potential perpetrator, being a person or government that may have access to Pegasus software, can come close to the father in terms of probability,\u201d McFarlane concluded.\nWhich meant that surveillance of the British phones belonging to Princess Haya, her two principal divorce lawyers and some of her associates \u201cwas carried out by servants or agents of the father, the Emirate of Dubai or the UAE\u201d \u2013 a stark conclusion of state spying that, along with McFarlane\u2019s others, was upheld by the court of appeal.\nYet, despite these developments, the legal battle between Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya is not over. The courts are yet to make their final decisions over the children\u2019s welfare, but McFarlane argued that trust between the parties was at a fresh low.\nIn a striking phrase, the judge summed up the issue: \u201cIt is often said that the most important thing that a house burglar steals is the peace of mind of the householder. The same must surely be true of phone hacking.\u201d",

She was dying of a rare heart condition\nAn Indigenous woman who was taunted by nursing staff as she lay dying in a Quebec hospital would probably be alive today if she were white, a coroner has concluded.\nThe death of Joyce Echaquan was an \u201cundeniable\u201d example of systematic racism in the province, the Qu\u00e9bec coroner G\u00e9hane Kamel told reporters on Tuesday.\n\u201cFrom the first minute she entered the hospital, a label was placed on Ms Echaquan,\u201d she said.\nIn September 2021, Echaquan, 37, entered a hospital in Joliette, where she told staff she had a heart condition. As her pain escalated and staff appeared indifferent to her pleas for help, Echaquan started livestreaming her experience on Facebook.\nIn the footage, she grimaced as nurses call her \u201cstupid as hell\u201d. \u201cAre you done acting stupid? Are you done?\u201d asked one nurse in French as Echaquan moaned in pain.\n\u201cYou made some bad choices, my dear,\u201d another nurse said. \u201cWhat are your children going to think, seeing you like this?\u201d\nEchaquan, an Atikemekw mother of seven, died of pulmonary oedema linked to a rare heart condition.\n\u201cWithout the video, Ms Echaquan would never have been heard. This observation sends chills down the spine,\u201d said Kamel.\nThe coroner determined that medical staff assumed Echaquan was experiencing opioid withdrawal and thus failed to properly evaluate the medications she was taking. They also ignored the symptoms she described, including heart palpitations.\nKamel concluded that Echaquan\u2019s initial diagnosis was based on prejudice and that she was not properly monitored before staff transferred her to intensive care.\nKamel told reporters that she believed Echaquan would be alive today if she were white, adding that \u201clarge sections of our society deny such a well-documented reality\u201d that systemic racism is pervasive.\nDespite Kamel\u2019s recommendation that the provincial government recognise systemic racism, the premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, steadfastly denied that systemic racism exists in the province. Legault said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Echaquan\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d treatment \u2013 but he denied it was an example of systemic racism.\n\u201cIs the entire education system, or health system racist? I believe the answer is no,\u201d Legault said. \u201cBut it\u2019s possible that at certain places, there are employees, groups of them, who have discriminatory approaches. But to say that the entire system is racist, I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d\nEchaquan\u2019s family have said they intend to file a lawsuit against the hospital.\n\u201cShe was judged and not listened to and treated accordingly,\u201d the family\u2019s lawyer, Patrick Martin-M\u00e9nard, told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that we have all the evidence.\u201d\nDetails of the lawsuit are expected in the coming days.\nCarol Dub\u00e9, Echaquan\u2019s husband, said he was committed to changing a system that discriminates against Indigenous families \u2013 and one that he believes judged his wife for having had multiple children.\n\u201cJoyce is dead because she was Indigenous,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman with seven marvellous children \u2013 what she had that was most beautiful was used against her in a system that still allows this kind of tragic situation to happen.\u201d",

        "content": "Labour says levelling-up premium for teachers is less generous version of old policy scrapped last year\nBoris Johnson has faced criticism after it emerged that the single notable policy announcement in his conference speech was not new, and was one of three sections on education that failed to properly stand up to scrutiny.\nIn his speech in Manchester the prime minister said he was \u201cannouncing a levelling-up premium of up to \u00a33,000 to send the best maths and science teachers to the places that need them most\u201d. While billed as new, the policy was launched in 2019 but then phased out.\nKate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe premium announced today is a less generous recycling of an old policy that Boris Johnson\u2019s government scrapped just a year ago.\u201d\nWhen asked about this on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, did not reject the idea that the policy was a revived one.\n\u201cIf we have policies that work, I\u2019m a pragmatist when it comes to these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something has worked then why not, when you have teacher shortages in core subjects, focused very much on particular parts of the country that really need them, focused very much on years 1 to 5, then let\u2019s try and encourage those teachers to stay in the profession or join the profession.\u201d\nElsewhere in the speech, Johnson hailed as an example of \u201cunleashing potential\u201d the achievements of Brampton Manor academy in east London, which despite its deprived location sends more children to Oxford or Cambridge than Eton does.\nJohnson described it as \u201ca new school that anyone could send their kids to\u201d. This is correct in that it is a state school. However, the school\u2019s sixth-form is highly selective, taking 300 students a year from about 3,000 applications. Johnson did not mention this.\nIn another education reference, Johnson took aim at Islington, the north London borough where he used to live, saying schools there \u201clike kids to run races where nobody actually wins\u201d.\nThis was another notable oversimplification. There has been a long-running debate over the idea of non-competitive school sports, particularly for younger children, for many years, based in part on the idea of instilling a love of physical activity in pupils without putting some off because they are less good at sports.\nHowever, this has been widespread and there is no evidence of it being unique to, or even particular to, Islington.",

        "content": "Ahead of her session at our upcoming one-day MBA, Dr Sunny Lee tackles three myths about negotiation, and presents some alternative perspectives.\nTeaching negotiations for the past seven years, I have heard from many people that they simply don\u2019t like negotiating. Surveys show similarly negative attitudes about negotiations in the workplace. According to a recent Glassdoor survey, about 60% of workers do not negotiate their salary. Another survey found that about 50% of workers felt uncomfortable initiating negotiations.\nGiven that negotiations are essential tools in every domain of our lives, it is important to understand why many of us feel negative and even repulsed by negotiations. Here, I identify three myths we might have about negotiating and discuss what alternative perspectives we can have about it.\n1. Negotiations are purely competitive.\nThe outcome of a negotiation typically includes dividing a pie between two parties. In other words, it is, in part, competition in which one party\u2019s win may likely mean the other party\u2019s loss. Competition, especially for women or individuals who have grown up in a collective culture, is seen as negative and distressful.\nHowever, I suggest that we pay more attention to win-win processes, such as joint problem solving and collaboration, that can occur in the earlier stages of a negotiation. In an attempt to understand each other\u2019s goals and underlying needs, negotiators often develop creative solutions that benefit both parties much more than an impasse would. For example, addressing a violent conflict between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party, Nelson Mandela spent a lot of time understanding the needs and challenges of the Freedom Party. In the end, Nelson motivated the party leader to join his new government. Depending on what we do in it, a negotiation can be value-creating, collaborative, and creative, rather than consistently, purely haggling.\n2. Talking about money is greedy.\nGreed is one of the words most associated with the act of negotiating. Money topics are taboo in many societies across the globe, and thus we often feel greedy and shallow when talking and asking about money.\nHowever, I would like to remind you that talking about money in negotiations is not necessarily a greedy and selfish act. Recently, in developing new academic programs at my institution, I initiated negotiating a fee structure. Through discussions with many stakeholders, this negotiation helped our school more effectively consider the principle of equity in our fee structure. Likewise, your negotiation on a salary, fees, or the price of a product can create great opportunities to evaluate and improve fairness issues in organisations. Of course, we must be careful not to be too narrow-focused on money itself.\n3. Great negotiators are born.\nIn the past, before entering academics, I used to cast serious doubt on the promises of seminars and workshops about behavioural changes, thinking, \u201cOnce I hit the age of 30, I am a fixed entity.\u201d\nBut after spending a decade researching human behaviours, teaching negotiation courses, and discovering myself, I am now a big believer in change and growth, regardless of our age. Twin studies and related research have shown that more than 50% of our intelligence, personality, and behaviours can be shaped and reshaped constantly. Renowned brain scientists, such as Lara Boyd, have recently found that our brains are capable of changing throughout life.\nThus, to feel and perform better in negotiations, you can consider participating in training. Training does not have to be part of an expensive degree. You can take a short-term course, or you can grab a great book to do role-playing with your friends. The more you expose yourself to systematic tools and simulation opportunities, the more fun and meaningful learnings you will find in negotiations.\nDr. Sunny Lee is an associate professor of organizational behaviour and the head of diversity at the School of Management, University College London, and will lead an interactive session on negotiation skills at The one-day MBA on Sunday 24 October 2021.

Some may wonder why the company does not appear to have acted so decisively against many other of its clients accused of abusing its technology.\nIn a statement in response to the stories published in July, NSO denied \u201cfalse claims\u201d, adding: \u201cThe fact that a number appears on that list is in no way indicative of whether that number was selected for surveillance using Pegasus. NSO is not related to the list [of numbers], it is not an NSO list, and it never was. It is not a list of targets or potential targets of NSO\u2019s customers.\n\u201cNSO Group will continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action based on the results of these investigations. This includes shutting down of a customer\u2019s system, something NSO has proven its ability and willingness to do, due to confirmed misuse, has done multiple times in the past, and will not hesitate to do again if a situation warrants.\u201d\nPast controversies involving Blair include when she lobbied Hillary Clinton, then US secretary of state, on behalf of the crown prince of Qatar, which the QC characterised as harmless. She also faced criticism for representing the government of the Maldives in its case against the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed, who was jailed for 13 years for terrorism after a trial ruled to be unfair by a UN working group.\nShe declined to comment on her role with NSO.",

A separate charge against Maxey of damage to a mobile phone was also dismissed.\nAn HS2 spokesperson said they were \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d with the outcome of the case.\nThe protesters dug a 100ft tunnel network secretly over a period of months and stored up enough food and water supplies to last throughout the subterranean protest. During the tunnel occupation they spent much of their time digging and shoring up the structure they had created.\nDistrict judge Susan Williams dismissed the charges in relation to the high-profile protest on the basis that HS2 was not carrying out any construction work on the site at the time the charges were levelled against the protesters. Instead, their aim was to clear the site of protesters and then begin the construction work.\nShe said: \u201cThere is no evidence of any constructor or construction taking place on the land at that time.\u201d\nThe subterranean environmental protest lasted for 31 days, one of the longest in UK protest history, although not quite breaking the record of a 40-day tunnel protest in Essex in 2000.\nThe court heard that the disruption to HS2\u2019s work at the Euston site cost about \u00a33.5m.\nBrett Easter, of high court enforcement, working with HS2 and a specialist in working in confined spaces, used the protesters\u2019 term \u201cBuckingham pallets\u201d to describe the structure the activists erected above the tunnel to conceal it during the covert construction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a game of cat and mouse. It was a very high-profile eviction,\u201d he told the court.\nThere were nine activists involved in the tunnel protest, ranging in age from 16 to 48. The two under-18 were not charged and a third activist was unwell and unable to attend this week\u2019s court hearing.\nAll say that the HS2 project is causing environmental damage, including to 108 ancient woodlands.\nHS2 disputes this and says that according to its assessments, 43 of the country\u2019s 52,000 ancient woodlands will be affected by HS2\u2019s route between London and Crewe, with 80% of the total area of these remaining untouched, meaning just 0.005% of ancient woodland will be lost, a fraction of losses from comparable road projects.\nThe protesters celebrated when they walked free from court and welcomed the judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the case against them.\nHooper said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have been in court in the first place because HS2 shouldn\u2019t have been happening. Our plan is to stop HS2. Aggravated trespass charges were completely the wrong ones to level against us.\u201d\nMaxey said: \u201cThis is a victory for the right to protest.\u201d\nSimon Natas, of ITN Solicitors, who represented the protesters, welcomed the judge\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThe protesters always maintained they never committed the offence of aggravated trespass. They have now been vindicated. We are extremely pleased,\u201d he said.\nAn HS2 spokesperson said: \u201cThe actions of these illegal trespassers put their own lives at risk, as well as the lives of our staff, agents and those of the emergency service personnel who worked around the clock to ensure the wellbeing of people who placed themselves in such a dangerous situation underground.\n\u201cThis action was an enormous waste of public money, especially during the pandemic, and we are bitterly disappointed that the court has not found fit to convict these individuals for their dangerous and irresponsible actions.\u201d",

But the scope they showed us those stories through was very narrow,\u201d Samuel said ahead of the film\u2019s gala. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really leave a way either side for any other interpretation. Women were always subservient. If you were a person of colour, you were less than human.\u201d\nLondon-born Samuel, known for his work as a songwriter and music producer under his stage name the Bullitts, assembled an all-black main cast including Jonathan Majors, Regina King and Idris Elba. Music was written by Jay-Z, who Samuel had previously worked with on The Great Gatsby film and a Jay Electronica album.\nThe Harder They Fall centres on Nat Love (Majors), an African American cowboy and former slave in the period following the American civil war, who reunites his gang to seek revenge against Rufus Buck (Elba) \u2013 the man who murdered his parents.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a uniqueness to a man from London, from the Harrow Road, making a western,\u201d Elba said. \u201cI grew up watching westerns. To have this moment to redefine the genre is definitely special.\u201d\nFor some of the cast, who had never previously been fans of westerns, it was Samuel\u2019s vision that convinced them to join the project \u2013 including the depiction of women in the film. \u201cThe agency of the character is important,\u201d said King, who plays Trudy Smith.\n\u201c[The women\u2019s] existence is not based on any man or child or parent, or some story that has to connect them to something, other than being who they are. And to have three women that are so different and so sure and still have those layers, not be one dimensional, was exciting to see. For a man to be the one to write it is so special.\u201d\nThe coronavirus pandemic played an important role in the cast and crew\u2019s thinking. Majors, who rose to prominence following his role in HBO series Lovecraft Country, said Covid had put everyone \u201cin the same bucket\u201d. \u201cWhen there is no enemy, we do have a way of separating ourselves. I grew up Methodist, they\u2019re Baptists down the street \u2026 That\u2019s Rufus Buck and Nat Love\u2019s game. It\u2019s through storytelling, and figuring out what brings us together, that we overcome it.\u201d\nElba said his performance \u201cwould be different had we not gone through Covid, it changed and matured me. We were thinking the world was going to die. But we stood back up. I was healthy and well. It really gave me a life-changing perspective.\u201d\nThe Luther star was one of the first public figures to declare he had Covid in March 2020, and he has previously spoken about the \u201ctraumatic\u201d impact on his mental health.\nThe Harder They Fall is released in cinemas on 22 October, and hits Netflix two weeks later. Samuels said they opted for the streaming platform because they wanted everyone to experience it at the same time. James Lassiter, who co-produced the film with Jay-Z, said: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to tell a story like this with this cast, the goal is to allow as many people around the world to have access to it. When you have a theatrical release there are built-in biases \u2013 some people won\u2019t want to see an all-black cast.\u201d\nThe Harder They Fall is one of 21 premieres at this years London film festival. The festival will screen 159 feature films, deliberately down on the 220-plus of previous years.\nThey include The Lost Daughter, which is Maggie Gyllenhaal\u2019s directorial debut and an adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s novel, Joanna Hogg\u2019s The Souvenir: Part II, Eva Husson\u2019s Mothering Sunday, and Jane Campion\u2019s 1920s western The Power of the Dog, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch as a ruthless Montana cattle rancher.",

Today is a celebration of my profession.\u201d\nCollaery is facing five charges of disclosing protected intelligence information to ABC journalists and of conspiring with his former client, ex-Australian Secret Intelligence Service officer Witness K, to communicate information to the Timor-Leste government.\nWitness K\u2019s actions helped expose a 2004 Australian bugging operation against an impoverished ally, Timor-Leste, which was designed to give Canberra the upper hand during sensitive negotiations to split oil and gas resources in the Timor Sea. A collection of oil and gas companies, led by Australian corporate Woodside, was hoping to exploit the natural resources in the Timor Sea.\nThe operation diverted intelligence resources during a period of heightened terror threat after the Bali bombings.\nCollaery and Witness K had their homes raided by Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency in 2013 as they were preparing to help Timor-Leste lodge a case in the international courts, alleging Australia\u2019s spy operation meant it had negotiated in bad faith.\nWitness K\u2019s passport was taken and he was prevented from leaving to give evidence.\nThe proceedings at The Hague were never finalised but eventually a new deal over the Timor Sea resources was struck, giving a far better outcome to Timor-Leste.\nThe Australian government then signed off on prosecution of Collaery and Witness K. The former attorney general Christian Porter subsequently invoked the NSI Act to keep significant parts of Collaery\u2019s trial secret.\nLabor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said on Wednesday that the court of appeal\u2019s judgment was a \u201chumiliating rebuff to the Morrison government\u201d.\n\u201cLabor strongly supports the principle of open justice and believes Mr Collaery, like any other Australian, has a fundamental right to a fair trial,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor reasons that still remain unclear, the former attorney general Christian Porter personally authorised the prosecution of Mr Collaery. After today\u2019s decision the current attorney general must now provide a detailed explanation as to why this prosecution remains in the public interest.\u201d\nHuman Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said the case represented a rare win for an accused against the use of the NSI Act, which typically weigh in favour of secrecy.\n\u201cBecause the NSI Act tilts the scales towards secrecy, defendants have typically failed to overcome the high bar in making the case for open justice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut before the court, Collaery has done just that.\u201d\nPender joined Labor in calling for a reconsideration of the prosecution, and separate cases against former military lawyer David McBride and tax office employee Richard Boyle, both of whom blew the whistle.\n\u201cThere is no public interest in prosecuting whistleblowers \u2013 the CDPP can and should drop these cases,\u201d he said.",

So when one officer asked to see his ID, James was confident he hadn\u2019t broken any rules.\nBut after he asked why he was being stopped, an officer told him he was being handed a $1,000 on-the-spot fine.\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me the reason \u2026 they just said I was breaching the public health orders,\u201d James, a frontline health worker who has asked to remain anonymous, said.\nJames is just one of many cases being handled by community legal centres in NSW, who say they are being \u201cbombarded\u201d by people who believe they have been issued unfair fines.\nSamantha Lee, a police accountability solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre, believes \u201cthe majority\u201d of cases her centre are handling \u201chave a legal argument for the fine to be withdrawn\u201d.\n\u201cWe are of the view that in the majority of the cases coming to us, the police have applied the law incorrectly,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI believe that we\u2019re not even at the tip of the iceberg. I think we\u2019re looking at a systemic failure by the police. There will be I think thousands more fines that have potentially been issued incorrectly.\u201d\nStatistics from Revenue NSW, detailed in an open letter, show more than 10,000 fines have been issued for breaches of Covid rules between March 2020 and July 2021, totalling over $9m.\nIn July alone, 6,815 fines were issued, more than three times the total amount of fines issued in the last financial year.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nA spokesperson from NSW police said officers have been using their discretion when handing out the fines.\n\u201cPolice have a number of powers to allow officers to carry out their law enforcement functions; arguably the power for police to use discretion is the most significant,\u201d they said.\n\u201cPolice have been using and will continue to use discretion as they enforce the Covid-19 Public Health Orders.\u201d\nA number of community legal centres across New South Wales are now calling on the state government to revoke all fines issued under Covid public health orders.\nRedfern Legal Centre, along with the Aboriginal Legal Service, Community Legal Centres NSW and Public Interest Advocacy Centre, also raised concerns that \u201cfines have been incorrectly issued by police\u201d in an open letter published last month.\n\u201cWe call on the government to reduce the use of policing and fines to ensure compliance with public health orders and invest more heavily in non-punitive approaches,\u201d it said.\nThe incident left James shaken up.\n\u201cI felt intimidated by the way they treated me. I was sitting in a public space, with no proximity to anyone else, there was no danger,\u201d he said.\nHe lodged a review for the fine, but had his application rejected by Revenue NSW. He has decided to take the fine to court, something he feels is \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cTo be honest, it feels a bit ridiculous, it\u2019s putting additional stress on myself, I have to take time off work, and I\u2019ll lose money on that day. Having to try and figure out how to pay or go to court is just an ongoing stress that I didn\u2019t need right now,\u201d he said.\nSamantha Lee from Redfern Legal Centre describes the situation as an \u201cadministrative disaster\u201d.\n\u201cThe public health orders should never have been an on the spot fine,\u201d she said.\n \u201cThere are so many rules, that are changing constantly, and that require the police to interpret what they mean. It is unjust to turn these into an on-the-spot fine.\u201d\nKeisha Hopgood, the acting principal solicitor at the Aboriginal Legal Service, said her organisation, which operates in NSW and the ACT, had also seen a raft of young people targeted.\n\u201cI think that there is absolutely a failure of police in certain circumstances to exercise their discretion appropriately. I have no doubt about that.\n\u201cWhen you have a young person with a mental health issue, or with difficult circumstances at home, and they\u2019re 14 years old, and they\u2019re out with a mate, there is a much more appropriate way to deal with that than by way of a $1,000 fine.\n\u201cThe police had in their arsenal the option of cautioning a young person, but I\u2019d be very hard pressed to see a circumstance where it was appropriate to fine a child, who wasn\u2019t having a party, wasn\u2019t deliberately being reckless. It\u2019s nonsensical, it doesn\u2019t act as a deterrent. It just sets up a future exacerbation of the situation these kids are in.\u201d\nHopgood explained that fines can accumulate for young people who may be unable to pay them, with the ripple effects including preventing them from obtaining a drivers licence.\n\u201cYou\u2019re really putting another layer of disadvantage on a kid who really, really doesn\u2019t deserve it and doesn\u2019t really need it.\u201d\nThe NSW government has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "World Health Organization\u2019s director general hails \u2018historic day\u2019 in fight against parasitic disease\nThe World Health Organization has recommended the widespread rollout of the first malaria vaccine, in a move experts hope could save tens of thousands of children\u2019s lives each year across Africa.\nHailing \u201can historic day\u201d, the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that after a successful pilot programme in three African countries the RTS,S vaccine should be made available more widely.\n\u201cI started my career as a malaria researcher, and I longed for the day that we would have an effective vaccine against this ancient and terrible disease. And today is that day, an historic day. Today, the WHO is recommending the broad use of the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine,\u201d Tedros said at a press conference in Geneva.\nThe RTS,S vaccine, also known as Mosquirix, was developed by the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and has been administered to more than 800,000 children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi since the pilot programme began in 2019.\nThe vaccine, which went through lengthy clinical trials, has limited efficacy, preventing 39% of malaria cases and 29% of severe malaria cases among small children in Africa over four years of trials.\nHowever, in August a study led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) found that when young children were given both the RTS,S and antimalarial drugs there was a 70% reduction in hospitalisation or death.\n\u201cUsing this vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year,\u201d said Tedros on Wednesday. \u201cIt is safe. It significantly reduces life-threatening, severe malaria, and we estimate it to be highly cost-effective.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cMalaria has been with us for millennia, and the dream of a malaria vaccine has been a long-held, but unattainable dream. Today, the RTS,S malaria vaccine, more than 30 years in the making, changes the course of public health history. We still have a very long road to travel. But this is a long stride down that road.\u201d\nThere have been fears that decades of progress towards ending malaria has stalled, with some countries, such as Eritrea and Sudan, seeing significant resurgences in recent years. In 2019, 409,000 people died from the mosquito-borne parasite disease, most of them in Africa. More than 270,000 of the victims were children under five.\nBut experts hope the WHO\u2019s announcement will re-energise the race to find other vaccines, a quest that has been going on for almost a century.\nEarlier this year, scientists at the Jenner Institute of Oxford University said a vaccine they had developed had shown results that would make it the first to meet the WHO goal of 75% efficacy. Over 12 months the vaccine showed up to 77% efficacy in a trial of 450 children in Burkina Faso. Larger trials are now beginning, involving 4,800 children in four countries.\nThomas Breuer, GSK\u2019s chief global health officer, said: \u201cGSK is proud that RTS,S, our groundbreaking malaria vaccine, developed over decades by our teams and partners, can now be made available to children across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\u201cThis long-awaited landmark decision can reinvigorate the fight against malaria in the region at a time when progress on malaria control has stalled. Both real-world evidence and clinical trial data show that RTS,S, alongside other malaria prevention measures, has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d\nGSK said it was committed to supplying up to 15m doses a year at no more than 5% above the cost of production, and would now work with partners, funders and governments to support additional supply of the vaccine.\nProfessor Sir Brian Greenwood from the LSHTM said: \u201cThe RTS,S vaccine does not provide complete protection but this decision is testament to the global health community\u2019s drive and vision to find a way forward. As part of a tailored approach it has great potential to reduce death and illness in high burden areas, especially when combined with other interventions such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention and bed nets, and be a huge boost to malaria control efforts.\u201d\nGareth Jenkins, director of advocacy at the charity Malaria No More, said the announcement was \u201ca truly historic moment\u201d and \u201canother critical step in building our armoury of weapons\u201d against malaria.\nNoting the role played by GSK in the development of the RTS,S vaccine, he called on the UK government to continue to invest in cutting-edge research that could \u201cfinally bring about a zero-malaria world\u201d.\n\u201cThis complex, but preventable and treatable disease, causes hundreds of millions of infections each year, risking lives and livelihoods, trapping people in poverty in some of the poorest countries in Africa, and creating \u2018disease blind spots\u2019 which threaten our own health security at home. If we save lives from malaria today, we can also protect ourselves against the diseases of tomorrow,\u201d he said.",

Worcester\u2019s Ted Hill and Leicester\u2019s Dan Kelly have both received three-match suspensions but the two cases underline the slim disciplinary margins under which players now operate.\nHill, Worcester\u2019s captain, was handed a red card five minutes from the end of the defeat against Gloucester for a tip tackle immediately after taking a raised boot to the neck from the Cherry and Whites\u2019 replacement Lloyd Evans. The 22-year-old flanker\u2019s actions were accepted to be unintentional, with the disciplinary panel admitting it was \u201ca slightly unusual\u201d incident which had caused no injury to his opponent, but he was still handed a three-game ban.\nKelly\u2019s ban was for striking with the shoulder or arm after he was cited following the controversial conclusion to Leicester\u2019s game against Saracens at Welford Road. The Tigers were six points behind when Guy Porter was bundled illegally into touch by the opposition scrum-half, Aled Davies. Following a TMO review a penalty was awarded to the home side and they went on to clinch victory but no heed was taken of the subsequent challenge by Kelly on Davies which was later ruled to be worthy of a red card.\nSaracens may well consider the verdict of the independent disciplinary panel comprising Mike Hamlin, Rob Vickerman and Martyn Wood is a case of the door being shut after the horse has bolted. Either way, with the two banned players now available for potential inclusion in England\u2019s autumn international squad, at least one leading Premiership coach says he hopes clearer distinctions will be drawn this season between accidental and cynical collisions.\nExeter\u2019s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, is among those who argues players who make only accidental contact with the heads of opponents should not necessarily be shown a red card, either at the time or upon review. The Chiefs had two players, Dave Ewers and Sam Skinner, banned from the Premiership final last season for semi-final offences which Baxter still believes deserved only yellow cards.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got to be aware of the process of protecting players but we also see instances where you go: \u2018That\u2019s just a complete accident,\u2019\u201d argues Baxter, encouraged by summer conversations on the subject with the Rugby Football Union and the Rugby Players\u2019 Association.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing process that is a lot more along the lines of how I\u2019d like to see it. We\u2019re starting to see a levelling out. I\u2019m a great believer that a red card should look like a red card. Hopefully we\u2019ll start seeing that a bit more now.\u201d\nBaxter, meanwhile, is looking forward to welcoming back his Lions tourists against Worcester on Saturday but may choose to delay Jack Nowell\u2019s latest comeback from injury for another week.",

The 14-year-old denies having a gun with intent to endanger life.\nProsecutor Michael Burrows QC said the attack had been captured on CCTV, with the attackers clad in masks and gloves at the height of a coronavirus lockdown. \u201cThey all wore their hoods up so their faces could not be seen. The CCTV shows one of the individuals had a gun and shot at Keon Lincoln twice. One of the shots hit Keon Lincoln in the stomach and caused fatal injuries,\u201d he said.\nBurrows added: \u201cThe prosecution say the gunman was \u2026 and is 14 years old. He is charged with murder and with possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. As I understand, he disputes that he was present and was the gunman.\u201d\nThe accused include a 14-year-old from Birmingham and a 16-year-old from Walsall, who are too young to be named. Also on trial are Kieron Donaldson, 18, of Perry Barr, who is alleged to have supplied the weapons but not to have been at the scene of the attack. Tahjgeem Breakenridge, 18, of Balsall Heath and Michael Ugochukwu, 18, of Edgbaston, are also accused of murder.\nThe \u201cgang\u201d of attackers are alleged to have been armed with large knives, with Lincoln suffering stab wounds to the legs and back as well as being shot in the abdomen.\nThe prosecutor said: \u201cHe was shot at whilst he was on the ground. Still, the group continued to attack him, stabbing and hacking at him with large knives. Eventually, the group ran away and got back into a white Ford S-Max and that car was driven away from the scene.\u201d\nThe car was stolen, the jury heard, and it was crashed soon after the attack. The jury were told forensic evidence tied defendants to the attack.\nBurrows told the jury: \u201cThe car they were going to use was a stolen car on false plates. When they got out of the car, they wore face masks and gloves. They also made sure that their phones did not betray their movements.\n\u201cPlainly, it\u2019s obvious this attack was planned. The attackers were out together armed with weapons.\n\u201cIn the case of [the 14-year-old], he was armed with a gun loaded with ammunition.\n\u201cIn short, the prosecution say, when you consider all the evidence from the CCTV and phone records, it is clear that these defendants are those shown in the CCTV, and that they were all involved in the murder of Keon Lincoln.\u201d\nThe trial continues.",

That had been a significant stumbling block when the initial deal hit the rocks in July last year, with the Premier League considering the PIF de facto the Saudi state when it came to passing its Owners\u2019 and Directors\u2019 Test.\nThat issue has been the subject of a long legal dispute by Ashley, which was expected to be resolved in an arbitration hearing in January, but will now be dropped.\nNews of the incumbent Newcastle owner\u2019s impending departure will provoke joy and relief among long\u2011suffering fans, who believe the retail magnate has run the club into the ground during his no-frills tenure. The prospect of the club being revitalised by new investors with deep pockets is now tantalisingly close to becoming a reality.\nThere is, though, likely to be a strong backlash from human rights groups, most notably Amnesty International, who have long warned that the Saudi regime is trying to \u201csportswash\u201d its reputation.\nAmnesty has also cautioned that civil society has also been silenced in Saudi Arabia and \u201canyone critical of the regime has been exiled, arrested, or threatened\u201d.\nThe US intelligence department has, significantly, named Prince Mohammed as having approved the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia\u2019s Turkish embassy in October 2018.\nThe Saudi consortium will own 80% of the club, with 10% going to the property developers Simon and David Reuben and the remaining 10% going to Staveley\u2019s PCP Capital Partners.\nOne of the new board\u2019s first tasks is likely to appoint a new manager to replace the deeply unpopular Steve Bruce. Although the former Manchester United centre-half has kept Newcastle in the top tier since succeeding the widely adored Rafael Ben\u00edtez in July 2019, he is regarded as an \u201cAshley puppet\u201d by large elements of the fan base and is still to oversee a league win after seven games this season. With his team currently second bottom, Bruce is almost certainly on borrowed time.\nIt is an open secret that the Saudis originally planned to reinstall Ben\u00edtez in the manager\u2019s office at St James\u2019 Park had the takeover proceeded as planned last year but the Spaniard has since taken charge of Everton and will not, after all, be making an emotionally charged return to Tyneside.\nThe former Italy, Chelsea and Internazionale coach Antonio Conte and the former Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane were among the decorated names being connected with the post onWednesday night. However sources close to the Saudi led deal have always maintained that, while relegation would be unthinkable, they would initially concentrate primarily on updating and improving the club\u2019s tired infrastructure.\nWhile a new training ground and enhanced academy are likely to be among the early priorities so, too, are hundreds of millions of pounds in investment in wider community and regional regeneration projects in the north east.\nLocal MPs and council leaders have long supported a potential takeover that chimes with the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda. Indeed it is understood that discreet discussions about how best to revive the buyout have taken place between British government intermediaries and their Saudi counterparts in recent weeks.",

My mum turned it off and said: \u2018OK. The moment\u2019s come for me to tell you. Sit down, I think you\u2019re ready to hear the story of papa and me now. When she told me I was left cold. Hearing that leaves a deep impression. Wow. It\u2019s like something in a film and my parents lived it.\u201d\nI\u00f1aki Williams stops and takes a breath. He was 20 that day, already playing for Athletic Club. Pushed into the public eye, he had been asked his story but couldn\u2019t tell it properly because he didn\u2019t know. Parts had been written wrong, but he didn\u2019t really know that either. He too had asked, desperate to find out exactly where he was from. \u201cIt ate away at me,\u201d he says. Until, at last, Maria told him.\nShe told him how they had left Ghana and crossed the Sahara without food or water, about those who didn\u2019t make it and how that could have been them. How they hid things the only place they could. How, pregnant with him, she climbed the fence into Melilla, Spain\u2019s north African enclave. And how she and Felix were arrested, a lawyer whose name he still doesn\u2019t know and, to his regret, never will providing a lifeline, a way of reaching the city where he was born. His place, where he has made history.\nLast Friday night, 28 years on, I\u00f1aki Williams played his 203rd consecutive league game, a record and the culmination of a journey that began before he was born. \u201cHearing my parents\u2019 story makes you want to fight even harder to give back everything they sacrificed for us. I couldn\u2019t ever repay them \u2013 they risked their lives \u2013 but the life I try to give them is the one they dreamed of giving us. And, in some way, we can say: \u2018We\u2019ve done it.\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019d watch the news and see boats arriving from Africa, people climbing the fence [into Melilla] and I realised I didn\u2019t really know how we got to Spain. It\u2019s something I always asked but my mum avoided it because I was just a kid. And maybe she then thought if she\u2019d told me when I started at Athletic at 18 it would have been a weight on my back. I knew my life was different to my friends\u2019 and I could imagine, but when you hear the details \u2026\n\u201cDetails like: I didn\u2019t know they had crossed the desert by foot. I knew my dad had problems with the soles of his feet but not that it was because he had walked barefooted across the Sahara sand at 40, 50 degrees.\n\u201cThey did part in a truck, one of those with the open back, 40 people packed in, then walked days,\u201d Williams continues. \u201cPeople fell, left along the way, people they buried. It\u2019s dangerous: there are thieves waiting, rapes, suffering. Some are tricked into it. Traffickers get paid and then halfway say: \u2018The journey ends here.\u2019 Chuck you out, leave you with nothing: no water, no food. Kids, old people, women. People go not knowing what\u2019s ahead, if they\u2019ll make it. My mum said: \u2018If I knew, I would have stayed.\u2019 She was pregnant with me but didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cThey reached Melilla, climbed the fence and the civil guard detained them. They didn\u2019t have papers and came as migrants, so you get sent back. When they were in jail a lawyer from [the Catholic aid organisation] Caritas who spoke English said: \u2018The only thing you can try is tell them you\u2019re from a country at war.\u2019 They tore up their Ghanaian papers and said they were from Liberia to apply for political asylum. Thanks to him, we arrived in Bilbao.\u201d\nWilliams smiles. Bilbao, of all places. \u201cDestiny,\u201d he calls it. Born there, the doors opened to Athletic with their Basque-only policy. His club. \u201cMy friends and I talk about it: bloody hell, incredible. Everything happens for a reason. If I hadn\u2019t been born in Bilbao, I could never have played for Athletic. My parents crossed the desert and were taken to the Basque country. That doesn\u2019t feel like chance.\u201d\nMaria and Felix moved to Pamplona, 150km south-east, getting state housing in \u201ca humble, hardworking barrio with lots of races where people made ends meet however they could\u201d. They met I\u00f1aki Mardones \u2013 which is where Williams got his name \u2013 a priest who became his godfather and their guardian. Clothes came from the church. There wasn\u2019t much, but Williams insists: \u201cI had food, something to wear, and compared to a many, many, people, I was rich. My parents\u2019 story told me that.\u201d\nWilliams\u2019s dad worked as a shepherd, a cleaner on a building site, anything he could find which wasn\u2019t always anything at all, later heading to London alone. \u201cHe worked in a shopping centre near Chelsea clearing tables in the food halls or as a security guard, tearing tickets at Stamford Bridge. Any job no one wanted.\u201d I\u00f1aki was 10 or 11. His brother Nico was two or three. Felix was gone a decade. Maria did two, three jobs at a time when there was work. I\u00f1aki became almost a father to Nico.\nAnd of course, he became a footballer, his first memory a kid called Xabi calling him down to the street to play at four or five. For a while, he even became a referee in local leagues: at \u20ac10 a game, it was valuable to him, although he needed more. He had promised his mum he would become a professional and at 18 joined Athletic, making his debut in December 2014 aged 20. \u201cI knew making it would fix many things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the debut itself, it was what it brought. It meant bringing my dad back from London, reuniting my family after 10 years, my little brother having the paternal figure, stability, the family we wanted so badly. I dreamed of being a footballer but also reuniting my family.\u201d\nWilliams was only the second black footballer to play for Athletic, after Jonas Ramalho. He is the only black player to have scored for the club but hopefully not for long: Nico, eight years younger, has joined him in the first team. The symbolic power is huge, a role he embraces. Subjected to racist abuse that convinced him and his teammates they would walk if it happens again, he has backed demonstrations and spoken with firm eloquence, beyond the game. Charismatic, direct, funny, his message reaches people. The pride is palpable at Athletic.\n\u201cPeople empathise with my story, identify with the sacrifice,\u201d he says. \u201cMy arrival opened minds. Athletic have done me a lot of good and I hope I\u2019ve done Athletic good. Footballers often don\u2019t speak out, but it\u2019s good for society. If you have the power to reach people you should. Racism is a stain, an illness to be eradicated. Not talking about discrimination allows it to exist, being permissive allows it to continue.\n\u201cSociety is changing: it\u2019s more open, there\u2019s more immigration, more diversity. When I arrived, there were very few black kids; now there are more in the youth system. Diversity, movement, brings that and we\u2019ll see it in the national team. England and France have many black players. Adama [Traor\u00e9] is here now, it\u2019s changing. We\u2019re going to get more used to seeing different faces in the same national team.\u201d\nIncluding his? the forward has played only once for Spain, a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2016. It remains his target, approaches from Ghana turned down. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to where I grew and became who I am. Ghana tried to convince me, but I was born in Spain, in Bilbao. I won\u2019t ever forget my family roots, but I feel Basque and can\u2019t con anyone. I would be comfortable with Ghana, I\u2019m sure, but I shouldn\u2019t be there \u2026\u201d\nThere\u2019s a grin. \u201cAnd my mum knows how people live football there: it\u2019s quite something, and she\u2019d be worried about me,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\u201cWhen my mum\u2019s angry, she swears at us in Ghanaian but we speak Spanish. When my parents came, it was English but we lost that. I could have a conversation in English but it\u2019s not fluent now. When my grandparents call, I speak to them in Twi. I admire and love Ghana, the culture, food, tradition. My parents are from Accra and I really enjoy going. But I wasn\u2019t born or raised there, my culture\u2019s here, and there are players for whom it would mean more. I don\u2019t think it would be right to take the place of someone who really deserves to go and who feels Ghana 100%.\u201d\nThe way that he feels Athletic, the club he supported and one that can feel almost like an unofficial national team sometimes. For whom he scored the winner in the Spanish Super Cup \u2013 only the second trophy they have won in 35 years. Williams always knew just one game for them would change everything; now there have been 304, 203 league matches in a row.\nThe last time he didn\u2019t play was 17 April 2016, when his teammate Yuri Berchiche injured his left ankle \u2013 and, yes, he has made sure Yuri knows that. Since then, five and a half years passed without Ernesto Valverde, Cuco Ziganda, Toto Berizzo, Gaizka Garitano or Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral leaving him out, without suspension or injury. Despite Williams being Spain\u2019s fastest player, the explosivity usually coming at the cost of torn muscles.\n\u201cThe doctors and physios say it\u2019s incredible, that it\u2019s impossible for there to be a case like this again, especially playing high-intensity games every three days,\u201d he says. \u201cThank my parents for the genes: I don\u2019t know what it is but there\u2019s something inside me.\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t played with knocks or pain; I\u2019ve played on medication with injections, moments the manager and the team needs you. And I had two seasons going into the final weeks with four yellows. \u2018Buah, if there\u2019s a fifth, that\u2019s a ban.\u2019 But I don\u2019t protest much or kick anyone,\u201d he admits, laughing.\n\u201c[But] it wasn\u2019t really until the last week that it was on my mind, when there were three games in seven days to break the record: home, away, home. You\u2019re so close, there\u2019s a risk, you think: \u2018Woah, something could happen, I could lose this.\u2019 Until then, you don\u2019t think of it. Destiny is written.\u201d\nHistory is too, especially here. Across the training pitch where Williams sits at Lezama, under the famous arch brought from the old San Mam\u00e9s, are two busts: Piru Gainza and Telmo Zarra. At the stadium, there is another of Pichichi. There may be no club with the liturgy of Athletic, no club that celebrates its tradition, its community, its past, like them. Somehow breaking the record here seems even more significant, Williams part of something bigger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hostia, bloody unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cMe and my teammates dreamed of being part of Athletic. I\u2019ve lived that dream. So many people would give anything to be where we are. Athletic is a union, a family. Together, we\u2019re strong. To be where I am, represent what I do, is incredible. To be able to say to my mum and dad, \u2018We did it\u2019, because everything they did was for us, to represent this club, wear this shirt, and for people to feel proud that I\u2019m part of Athletic\u2019s history.\u201d\nNow so is Nico. \u201cI have a history I started to write seven years ago; he has to write his own,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe\u2019re living this together, I\u2019m proud of him and he\u2019s doing very well, progressing fast, but he still has a lot, a lot, to prove and a lot, a lot, of work ahead. Let him be, let him grow, let him earn whatever comes.\u201d\nJust so long as that\u2019s not 204 games in a row. I\u00f1aki Williams laughs. \u201cWell, if someone has to take the record off me, let it be my brother.\u201d",

It comes with the Met in crisis after the sentencing last week of Wayne Couzens to a whole life sentence when details of the extent of his crimes emerged.\nLast March, Couzens, then a Met officer, abused his police powers, equipment and training, to trick Everard into getting into a car, where handcuffed she was driven away to be raped, murdered and her body burned as he tried to hide his crimes.\nOver a week later, after Couzens had been charged with the murder, a scheduled vigil on Clapham Common, south London, close to where Everard was kidnapped, was cancelled because of pandemic lockdown restrictions. But a crowd, comprised largely of women, still gathered to pay their respects to Everard and protest over male violence against women.\nStevenson was handcuffed and later fined. She is suing the Met over her treatment. She told the BBC about 50 police officers and security guards had liked her profile on Tinder: \u201cThey were all in uniform on their profiles or it said \u2018I\u2019m a police officer\u2019.\n\u201cIt is almost like an intimidation thing, saying, \u2018Look we can see you\u2019, and that, to me, is terrifying.\n\u201cThey know what I went through and they know that I\u2019m fearful of police and they\u2019ve done that for a reason.\u201d\nStevenson\u2019s photo appeared in countless news outlets. The Met\u2019s actions in breaking up the vigil were initially condemned but later exonerated completely by a report from the policing inspectorate.\nThe Met said: \u201cWe have contacted the individual who has spoken about these concerns to offer our support and make enquiries. At this time we have not received complaints in relation to this incident, but we will to continue to liaise with them about the circumstances so we can establish whether any misconduct may have occurred, and determine the appropriate next steps.\n\u201cOfficers must abide by our high standards of professional behaviour both on and off duty. If someone believes that an officer\u2019s conduct or behaviour on any social media or internet platform falls below these standards we would urge them to please contact us so that it can be properly investigated and appropriate action taken.\u201d",

NSW is looking forward to some freedoms now that it has reached 70% double-dose vaccination coverage of the adult population but police have been accused of handing out unfair Covid fines \u2013 to the tune of $9m. The US faces another debt impasse.

But community legal centres have accused police of \u201csystematic failure\u201d over the \u201cridiculous\u201d proportion of on-the-spot Covid fines handed down to younger Australians. More than 10,000 fines were issued for alleged Covid infractions between March 2020 and July 2021, with a blitz of 6,815 fines being handed out in July 2021 alone.

The two officers who were present at the scene did not have their body cameras turned on.\nLynch\u2019s father filed a $50m wrongful death lawsuit in June. In its response, the city said Lynch, who was Black, pointed a gun at the officer who shot him. The officer, who also is Black, \u201cfeared for his life and the lives of other officers and citizens in the vicinity\u201d, the city said.\nAccording to the city, the total economic impact of the festival in 2019 was $24.11m and was worth a lot more besides.\n\u201cAs impressive as those figures are, they are just that \u2013 numbers. We have not lost sight of the intangible, unquantifiable impact the festival has had on the social fabric of our community,\u201d wrote Patrick Duhaney, Virginia Beach city manager.\nBut Williams\u2019s letter to city leaders stated: \u201cI wish the same energy I\u2019ve felt from Virginia Beach leadership upon losing the festival would have been similarly channeled following the loss of my relative\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s appeal to Williams has been met with criticisms on social media.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this straight. His cousin was murdered. They do nothing about not only his cousin but to help make black residents feel safe and welcome, but he should ignore it and help the city be enriched with his festival. They are not even reasonable,\u201d was one tweeted response among others.\nMayor Bobby Dyer appealed to Williams for a meeting to discuss the situation.",

        "content": "Trescothick threw light on to the mental health problems in cricket, and we need better understanding more than ever\nTime flies. It\u2019s been 15 years since Marcus Trescothick last played for England, in a warmup match against New South Wales in November 2006. He broke down in the dressing room on the last day of the game \u2013 \u201cAll the same feelings of irrational fear, despair and panic came back in wave after bloody great wave\u201d \u2013 and flew back to England that same evening. The team management described it as a \u201crecurrence of a stress-related illness\u201d. There were a lot of accusations, jokes and innuendoes, which were only put straight when Trescothick published his autobiography in 2008, and people at last began to understand how badly he was suffering.\nIt was a turning point for the sport. Right now Ben Stokes is on an indefinite break while he treats his mental health, and an entire Ashes tour has been in the balance \u2013 it is all set to go ahead, according to the latest reports \u2013 while his teammates have been trying to decide whether their employers could guarantee proper care and protection for their mental health. After Trescothick, after Mike Yardy, after Jonathan Trott, after Sarah Taylor, and so many others, you would think we\u2019d all understand their argument by now. But the game has changed so much, so fast, not everyone does.\nYou can hear it in the remarks made by some players and pundits, and read it online, in the comment sections and on social media. It\u2019s a privilege. They\u2019re being paid to play. They should be proud. Fans who can only dream of what a player\u2019s life must be like expect them to be happy with their lot.\nI\u2019ve suffered with depression myself, have interviewed, and written about, many of those same players and, if I\u2019m honest, there are times when even I can\u2019t quite wrap my head around this radical shift in the way we think about sport, which belies the old idea that the admirable thing is persisting through the suffering, that strength is always in the overcoming.\nResearchers are only just beginning to flesh out all the anecdotal evidence about the mental health problems in cricket. The British Medical Journal recently published a review of the existing literature in the field. The authors concluded that elite cricketers are \u201cat high risk for distress, anxiety, depression and adverse alcohol use\u201d and are \u201cmore likely to experience anxiety and depressive symptoms\u201d than members of the general population.\nThe most interesting of the studies included was published in South Africa in 2017, on a group of 116 current and former professional cricketers, all under the age of 45.\nAmong that group, 38% were suffering with distress, 38% with sleep disturbance, 37% with anxiety/depression and 26% with adverse alcohol use. These figures weren\u2019t just higher than you would expect to find in the general population, they were higher than have been found in similar studies of elite athletes in other sports such as rugby union and football. The authors of the BMJ study talk specifically about the effects of long tours. The authors of the South African study mentioned in particular \u201cthe constant feeling of guilt from balancing a professional career as sportsmen and their family commitments\u201d. And that was before the pandemic.\nThe British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine started the job of unpicking the effects of the past two years in its latest magazine, which was devoted to mental health in cricket. In it Ian Thomas from the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association reported a dramatic rise in the number of members accessing mental health support, from 34 cases in 2015 to 94 in 2020. He suggests the spike is because of a rise in awareness, and more recently by the stress caused by pay cuts, employment uncertainty and biosecure bubbles. Until you\u2019ve been in one, Thomas says, it\u2019s hard to imagine how hard life in a bubble can be.\nIt\u2019s not just the isolation, Thomas explains, it\u2019s the boredom. It makes people more vulnerable. They drink more, gamble more and exercise less. The magazine also includes an article by two members of Cricket Australia\u2019s medical staff, Matt Burgin and Dr John Orchard, who say that, while the symptoms caused by bubbles may be subclinical (so, easy to dismiss) they are also cumulative \u201cand it is possible that the negative effects were experienced weeks and months after the event\u201d. Orchard and Burgin write about \u201cthe widespread acceptance of players making personal decisions to prioritise their mental health\u201d as \u201ca cultural shift for Australian sport\u201d. And beyond.\nLike so much else that has happened in the past 18 months, this may be a permanent change. There\u2019s a sense that priorities have shifted irrevocably during the pandemic. The stand over the Ashes may be another sea change in the sport, brought about by players who have more options, so more power, than they did in Trescothick\u2019s day.\nThe PCA, which recently ran an independent review of its mental health provision, has already cottoned on to this shift in the way players think about their health. So have the administrators. The England and Wales Cricket Board has been trying its best, in its way, to manage the problem by running a rotation policy on tour. And soon as England lost, the ECB was nailed for it.\nThe ECB may have made mistakes along the way (using mental health as justification for pulling out of the tour to Pakistan was one) but reading some of the coverage, and comments, it feels like it\u2019s the rest of us who are still catching up to the fact that things are different now.\nAt the start of the last decade, progress was in understanding that some people were struggling; at the start of this decade, it\u2019s in understanding that almost everyone is.",

Fikayo Tomori, the Milan defender, declined on Wednesday to say whether he was jabbed and, with England\u2019s manager Gareth Southgate revealing last weekend that he did know not how many members are vaccinated, it was notable that Abraham was open about his status.\n\u201cIt is a personal choice,\u201d the Roma striker said. \u201cPeople are entitled to do what they want to do with their bodies. For me it was a different situation. I am vaccinated. That is a personal choice. I have contracted the virus before, I am in Italy and for me it is the right thing to do. Everyone is entitled to do what they want to do and what is personal to them. They should make the decision to what they want to do.\u201d\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, launched a stinging attack on people who refuse vaccinations, comparing them to drink-drivers and arguing that they are to blame if people catch Covid from them. It has become a difficult debate in football, with many Premier League clubs reportedly struggling to convince their players to get jabbed.\nAbraham\u2019s openness was accompanied by Tomori\u2019s reluctance to talk about whether he has been vaccinated. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal issue,\u201d the former Chelsea defender said. \u201cIt varies from Italy to England. I want to keep it to myself \u2026 for every personal individual it\u2019s their own prerogative to take it or not take it.\u201d\nTomori, who has returned to the squad for England\u2019s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Hungary, was asked whether it was important that elite footballers are vaccinated. He said: \u201cIf I want to do what I want to do then that is it. If another player wants to do that it is a personal issue \u2013 not just for every athlete but for people who are not athletes.\u201d\nThe 23-year-old accepted that people want to know which way players are swaying on the topic. \u201cWe\u2019re public figures so I definitely see why people are wondering or asking: \u2018If they\u2019re going to take it, I\u2019m going to take it. If they\u2019re not going to take it, I\u2019m not going to take it\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to put it out there if I\u2019ve done this or done that to influence people. It\u2019s to leave people to their own if they want to do it or not.\u201d\nThere have been reports that players are worried about the vaccine affecting their virility. Tomori said: \u201cI haven\u2019t had any conversations about the vaccinations or anything like that \u2026 it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re really talking about.\u201d",

        "content": "Gielgud theatre, LondonThe climactic play based on Hilary Mantel\u2019s magisterial trilogy has wit and grace but no great dramatic release\nIt\u2019s a truism all too well known to Thomas Cromwell that history is written by the victors. By the final volume in Hilary Mantel\u2019s magisterial trilogy, Cromwell is on his way out, yet the dark magic of Mantel\u2019s pen is such that the blacksmith\u2019s boy from Putney has dominated the cultural landscape of the early 21st century \u2013 on page, stage and television \u2013 for almost as long as he did the political one of the 16th.\nBut all good things come to an end, and the evidence of this third and final play is that the spell is broken. We know that Cromwell\u2019s failure to broker a successful fourth marriage for Henry, to Anna of Cleves, will lead to his execution. But this biographical inevitability sucks the life out of the project, returning the Tudor court to a parade of stuffed doublets. There are seven of them on stage within minutes of the curtain rising on Jeremy Herrin\u2019s production, and it took most of the first half to work out which was which.\nIt\u2019s not that the play is lacking in wit or grace. Co-written by Mantel with its star, Ben Miles, it mines some of the novel\u2019s best scenes: when a newly wed Jane Seymour (a nicely po-faced Olivia Marcus) complains about the unreasonable demands of her husband, Cromwell and her retinue squirm with embarrassment before the reason is revealed: he wanted her to ride with him to Dover to inspect the fortifications. But this is more an interlude than part of a dramatic engine.\nThe Cromwell of the novel is a clerical genius, whose obsessive stocktaking illuminates not only his own interiority but the whole world of Tudor England. Here, ghosts stand in for colour and psychology: his father, in workman\u2019s brown, heckles him for his failings, while Cardinal Wolsey drifts around in a haze of scarlet, reminding him of his duty to his better nature.\nAt the heart of it all is the relationship between an increasingly despotic monarch and the operator he cannot do without. Miles\u2019s lean, silver-haired Cromwell mothers the king through his tantrums, but his shrewd eye becomes increasingly darting as he sees his advantage slipping away. Though Nathaniel Parker\u2019s Henry is not as repulsive as the text suggests, age has puffed out his girth while shrinking his temper to a childish petulance as he drags his gammy leg around.\nAfter the death in childbirth of Jane Seymour, the pace quickens, the tone darkens and the production belatedly finds its mojo. Christopher Oram\u2019s monumental concrete set, which at first seemed a blockade against the very porousness that is the key to Cromwell\u2019s genius, is criss-crossed with light as the court dissolves into a ghastly masquerade. The beaky masks of all the aristocratic revellers mirror an earlier shadow play of the scythes and swords of the Pilgrimage of Grace, the popular uprising that was the start of Cromwell\u2019s fall from grace.\nThe costumes enact a commentary of their own on the vagaries of the body politic: Nicholas Boulton\u2019s wayward Duke of Suffolk sports ruched breeches, in pointed contrast with the mothy velvet of Nick Woodeson\u2019s pompous Duke of Norfolk. Jane Seymour and Mary Tudor (Melissa Allan) are virtuous triangles, while Rosanna Adams\u2019 refreshing Anna of Cleves is a resolute, and perfect, square. This is all very fine, but there\u2019s no grief, no great release at the end, just a dull sense of a historical juggernaut juddering to a halt.\n At the Gielgud theatre, London, until 23 January.",

        "content": "Epidemiologist Michael Baker also recommended people get their second vaccine dose after three weeks rather than six\nNew Zealanders who have managed to escape coming into contact with Covid-19 should ready themselves to encounter it by Christmas, a leading epidemiologist has warned, as the country ramps up its vaccine rollout.\nThe prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced on Monday that the ambitious elimination strategy would soon be phased out as vaccination rates increase. The move has caused some alarm among experts, who warn that a change in strategy and a loosening of restrictions while the vaccination rates are still low could disproportionately affect communities who are vulnerable to the virus, including M\u0101ori and Pasifika.\nThe country reported 29 new cases of the Delta variant in the community on Thursday, bringing the total in the latest outbreak to 1,448. Five of Thursday\u2019s cases are in Waikato, the region immediately south of Auckland\u2019s border, with the rest in Auckland.\nJust over 77% of New Zealanders over the age of 12 have had their first dose of the vaccine, and 49% are fully inoculated.\nSpeaking to RNZ on Thursday, epidemiologist Michael Baker said: \u201cBasically I think \u2026 all New Zealanders should plan to encounter this virus in the next couple of months and act accordingly.\u201d\nBaker added that now is the time to fight it and the best way to do this is through vaccination.\nOn Thursday the government encouraged people to reduce their time between vaccine doses to three weeks rather than the earlier recommended six weeks, which Baker said is the right move.\n\u201cFor example, if you have your first dose next week you\u2019d get your second dose three weeks after that at the start of November, and you\u2019d be fully protected by mid-November, so I think that\u2019s really what people should plan to do, and the trouble is, if you have a six-week gap between your two doses, that really pushes that protection right into December, and some people might miss out at that stage.\nOn Wednesday, the Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, announced further measures to boost vaccination rates, including a \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d national day of action on 16 October.\n\u201cOn that day, we will have vaccine clinics open all through Aotearoa all day and into the evening and a bit like election day, we will be asking all our civic and political leaders to contribute to a big effort to turn people out.\u201d\nCommunities and health centres are coming up with innovative solutions to help the push, including an Auckland vaccination centre that will pull an all-nighter this weekend.\nThe T\u0101maki Vaccination Centre, led by Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014crakei, Auckland central\u2019s M\u0101ori tribe, will open at 8am on Friday and continue vaccinating until 6.30am on Saturday, with a DJ spinning tunes on Friday evening and staff running a barbecue.\nThe centre aims to reach people who struggle to get to vaccinated during the day, including those who work night shifts.\nMeanwhile, Auckland teachers have told RNZ they are deeply worried about the prospect of schools reopening on 18 October, after the school holidays.\nThe Post Primary Teachers\u2019 Association Auckland region deputy chairperson, Paul Stevens, said he was unhappy about it when there was still community transmission of Covid-19.\nThe government was essentially asking schools to operate at alert level 2 while the rest of Auckland was operating at level 3, he said.\n\u201cThe 18th of October is coming up very fast, and I think the main thing teachers are feeling at the moment is trepidation about the uncertainty of what it\u2019s going to look like once we go back.\u201d\nHipkins, who is also the education minister, said cabinet would vote on Monday on making Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory for teachers.",

        "content": "Even if her appeal against sexual harassment verdict is unsuccessful, Xianzi is proud that more women now feel they can share their experiences \nSitting inside a Beijing courthouse late at night last month, Zhou Xiaoxuan and her lawyers came to a quick decision. Their years-long effort to seek justice for her alleged sexual harassment by one of the country\u2019s most popular celebrities was clearly not going to go their way. In a short statement the court ruled she had tendered insufficient evidence.\nOn Weibo she wrote to her supporters with a list of criticisms of the judgment and process. \u201cFailure is not shameful, and I am honoured to have stood with you together in the past three years \u2026 Thank you very much, everyone, I will definitely appeal.\u201d\nThe next day her social media accounts were shut down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the only ones who can speak are the other side,\u201d she tells the Guardian, through a translator. \u201cIt\u2019s the same feeling from 2014 [the year of the alleged assault]: people telling you that you are not important and you should shut up. Like I\u2019m not someone who lost their case in the sexual harassment case, but instead I am the criminal.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a few weeks after that long day in court, and the furore around this young woman who never planned to be famous is starting to ebb. Cut off from communication with her supporters and planning her next move, Zhou \u2013 widely known by her nickname Xianzi \u2013 speaks with determination.\nIn the seven years since the alleged incident and three since she went public with her claims, Xianzi, now 28, pushes back on the descriptor she\u2019s been given \u2013 the face of China\u2019s #MeToo movement. But years later she does feel a \u201cresponsibility\u201d now, to continue. \u201cI cannot even imagine how we were all insistent for so long,\u201d she says.\n\u201cFor others the fact that we lost the case is very frustrating, but for me, this is the result of every single person doing all they can do and making all the effort. This is a miracle.\u201d\nXianzi didn\u2019t plan on her accusations going viral. In mid-2018, as many women in China began sharing their own #MeToo stories online, she saw that a close friend had posted her own story to WeChat.\n\u201cBack then, we still had those strong feelings of shame,\u201d she says. \u201cI told her that I thought she was very brave and I hoped to write an article too, to stay with her and support her and share the shame. Just to let her know that what she wrote was not in vain.\u201d\nBut Xianzi\u2019s 3,000 character long essay about Zhu Jun, a famous state broadcasting host and member of China\u2019s political advisory body, was never going to go unnoticed, even as censors went to work on the flood of stories online. Her post, and a subsequent one, spread like wildfire across China\u2019s social media.\nIn it, she alleged that in 2014 Zhu Jun sexually harassed her, forcibly groping and kissing her for almost an hour when she went to his dressing room to try to interview him. She was a 21-year-old intern on his show, and she says she was terrified and unable to respond.\nThe following day she went to the police to report it but, she says, they told her he was a famous person of good reputation and \u201cpositive energy\u201d for the country, so she should leave it alone. They also contacted her parents \u2013 party members with government jobs \u2013 and warned them that she shouldn\u2019t speak out.\n\u201cWhat they did was deny my existence,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt was like telling me: what you\u2019re feeling and what hurt you are less important than the other person. That your social impact is less important than the other person. In 2014, I was a college student, I didn\u2019t know anything and gave up easily.\u201d\nAfter Xianzi\u2019s essay came out, Zhu \u2013 who strenuously denies the allegations \u2013 sued her for defamation and damages of 650,000 RMB ($100,000). She countersued for \u201cviolation of personality rights\u201d, using the only available law at the time, as China was yet to introduce legislation on sexual harassment. The Guardian\u2019s attempts to contact Zhu, who has not spoken publicly about the case since 2018, were unsuccessful. The defamation case is still active.\nThe civil case went through two delayed and ultimately unsuccessful trials. The court experience was frustrating for Xianzi, and she claims she was denied sufficient chances to speak, and supporting evidence was rejected. Observers and press were barred, and Zhu\u2019s presence was not mandated. The court also denied her application to alter her case to use the since-enacted law against sexual harassment.\nIn the drawn-out process, Xianzi\u2019s case became one of the most watched in China, despite the closed-door hearings and online censorship, drawing international attention and lighting up China\u2019s online feminist movement. Supporters braved the heavy police presence outside court to show up with placards of support.\nOutside an earlier hearing, Yang Ruiqi, a third-year university student, told the Guardian the #MeToo movement had been an inspiration. It had made her \u201crealise that things which made me feel uncomfortable before were wrong, it wasn\u2019t because I was being too sensitive.\u201d\nBut Xianzi also drew anger. She was abused and trolled online, harassed, called a liar and slut-shamed, even accused of working for a foreign power. As she arrived for her final day in court, she was shoved by antagonistic bystanders who tried to prevent her speaking, while a man questioned whether it was appropriate for her to speak alone.\n\u201cThe public opinion, the attacks indeed bothered me,\u201d she says. \u201c[But] it is not a threat, those people who attack me online probably would not dare to hurt me offline.\n\u201cThey attacked me personally, but for me, the more hurt I am, the more I want to insist on things \u2026 It is more meaningful to work hard in this bad situation.\u201d\nOne day after Xianzi\u2019s case was dismissed, the Weibo account with which she had amassed a following and communicated with supporters and victims, was suspended.\n\u201cWhen you speak about feminism on the internet, it is very easy to be banned and it has always been like this, they don\u2019t even need a reason to ban you,\u201d she says.\nAmid an ongoing purge of online subculture groups and expression, the years-long targeting and censorship of feminists and feminist organisations has continued, with cyber-attacks and pile-ons linked to increasing nationalism on Chinese social media. In April, in response to waves of online attacks on women, social media platforms shut down the accounts of victims and their supporters.\nWith high rates of violence against women and gender discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, and general complaints of a lack of enforcement or accountability, Xianzi\u2019s case was being watched closely by women across the country who felt the system did not support them. There had been some wins during the height of the #MeToo discourse, but there was still a long way to go.\nIn reality, very few cases make it to court. Legal analysts have pointed to a high burden of proof and general requirements for physical evidence. A week before the court threw out Xianzi\u2019s case, prosecutors dropped a case against an Alibaba manager accused of sexually assaulting an employee, saying he committed \u201cforcible indecency\u201d but that it did not constitute a crime.\nXianzi says she doesn\u2019t regret coming forward with her allegations or pursuing legal action.\nShe says work on the appeal regarding her sexual harassment case is consuming her days, but that the conversation the movement \u2013 and her case \u2013 has started has been worthwhile, even if she does not succeed.\n\u201cPeople are willing to speak publicly about what happened to them and share their experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that we can discuss publicly, is already very valuable. It not only can comfort other women but also make the general public understand more about sexual harassment and sexual assault. This is the most important thing \u2013 young girls no longer feel guilty and ashamed.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Chi Hui Lin",

On Wednesday the court heard submissions on the tweet\u2019s meaning and evidence from Dutton that he was deeply offended by it.\nOn Thursday, Justice Richard White heard arguments on Bazzi\u2019s case that if he did defame Dutton, defences of fair comment and honest opinion should apply. Dutton has argued the tweet is not protected by honest opinion because Bazzi was \u201cactuated by malice\u201d.\nDutton has cited a tweet on 4 March, in which Bazzi said: \u201cDutton is a rape apologist and a fascist who abuses women and children\u2026 Fucken scumbag.\u201d\nFerrett began Thursday\u2019s hearing by rhetorically querying \u201cwhere is Mr Bazzi?\u201d\nAlthough Ferrett accepted the onus was on Dutton to prove malice, he said \u201cone might have thought \u2026 [Bazzi] might want to explain\u201d why the 4 March tweet did not indicate an intention to aggravate Dutton.\nFerrett noted earlier on 25 February Bazzi had called Dutton a \u201cfascist and a torturer\u201d, and said this was \u201cthe sort of thing I would have liked to put to him to have him explain why that oughtn\u2019t be seen as evidence of his intention not just to discuss something of public importance but specifically to wound Mr Dutton\u201d.\nFerrett noted Bazzi was \u201cwell-represented\u201d and submitted that the \u201cfailure to give evidence might be seen as tactical\u201d and allowed the court to draw an inference on malice.\nOn the merits of the defences, Justice White intervened to question whether rape apologist \u201cinvolves some element of characterisation and evaluation of [Dutton\u2019s] conduct\u201d and suggested it did not describe an \u201cobjective feature\u201d such as \u201cMr Dutton is tall\u201d. Ferrett responded that the tweet was a \u201cbald accusation\u201d that did not involve any evaluation.\nOn damages, Ferrett said they were \u201cparticularly important \u2026 not only to salve hurt feelings but as vindication\u201d. \u201cOne of the things about this medium \u2026 is that once something is said, particularly something inflammatory, it is republished over and over.\n\u201cVindication \u2026 is more necessary for the person who has been to defamed to be able to say \u2018this lie has been nailed\u2019 and here is the judgment which says as much.\u201d\nBazzi\u2019s case on \u201cfair comment\u201d argues the tweet was \u201cbased on facts which were stated, sufficiently indicated or notorious\u201d.\nFerrett submitted that Dutton\u2019s comment on 25 February that he did not know the \u201cshe said, he said\u201d detail of Brittany Higgins\u2019 sexual assault allegation was not sufficiently notorious to be relied on by Bazzi for the purpose of the defence.\nBazzi\u2019s counsel, Richard Potter, responded that the remark, made at a press conference and reported in at least two news items, was sufficiently notorious to ground the opinion.\n\u201cIn the world of this social media platform it is common \u2026 that it is taken for granted that the news of the day is capable of being commented on without reciting the whole news of the day,\u201d he said.\nBazzi\u2019s tweet included a link to a June 2019 Guardian Australia article reporting comments the then-home affairs minister had made on Sky News alleging women had been \u201ctrying it on\u201d in claiming they were raped and needed an abortion as part of a ploy to get to Australia for medical treatment from refugee centres on Nauru.\nPotter submitted the link allowed readers to \u201cclick through and judge for themselves\u201d the basis of the opinion expressed.\nPotter noted that article included the fact that in 2016 the federal court found Dutton had breached his duty of care to a woman who became pregnant as a result of rape, and exposed her to serious medical and legal risks in trying to avoid bringing her to Australia for an abortion.\nOn Wednesday Bazzi\u2019s counsel, Potter told the hearing the ordinary, reasonable reader \u201cwould not understand\u201d the tweet to mean Dutton was condoning or excusing rape when read in conjunction with the Guardian Australia news link.\nFerrett responded on Thursday that \u201cnobody \u2013 whether it is lawyer, a priest, or a man walking down street \u2013 thinks \u2018rape apologist\u2019 means anything other than excuse or condones rape\u201d.\nThe hearing concluded late on Thursday morning. Justice White reserved his decision. Guardian Australia contacted Bazzi for comment.",

The sandstone cone of Colmer\u2019s Hill rises in the mid-distance, shawled\u00a0in bracken and topped with a clump\u00a0of pine trees, like sprigs of holly on a Christmas pudding. Over the years, it has become the town\u2019s unofficial emblem, reproduced on everything from jam pots to websites. Named after the Rev John Colmer, a 19th-century landowner, the landmark is about a mile outside Bridport in the small, golden-stone village of Symondsbury.\nThere\u2019s a path that goes up and over Colmer\u2019s, which I take early on a crisp, russeting morning. Hardy\u2019s sheep are here still \u2013 the grass is slippery with dew-wet droppings turned green by the autumn flush of grass. The bracken may be browning and crumpling, but nostalgic reminders of spring remain: a song thrush singing in the top of a holly tree, a chiffchaff calling, and wrens drilling their songs through the hedgerows.\nHalfway up the hill\u2019s steep north\u00a0side, the Channel heaves into\u00a0view, a mild denim blue infill where the cliffs dip to shingle at Eype\u2019s Mouth.\nThe number of trees at the summit always surprises me. From\u00a0afar, it looks like there are only four or five, but they are actually too numerous to count. Colmer\u2019s was bare until 1918, when\u00a021 Caledonian pines were planted in memory of local men who had died during the first world\u00a0war. Then a few years ago\u00a0the\u00a0landowners added Monterey pine saplings. Today, the grove sighs\u00a0sweet and resinous around a white flagpole and concrete trig\u00a0point.\nI pause to watch a shoal of swallows and house martins skim over the grass, picking off stumbling craneflies, their white bellies flashing silver in the sunshine as they swoop and turn.\nFar below, children are racing around the school playground, wheeling in wide circles, shrieking\u00a0and laughing. At three\u00a0minutes to\u00a0nine, a handbell\u00a0rings and the\u00a0day begins.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

An estimated 400 to 600 police stations were closed or sold off.\nBabu said that while an additional 20,000 police officers had been promised by the current government, civilian staff supporting officers to analyse trends and data were not getting a similar boost.\n\u201cEffectively, in the last 10 to 11 years you\u2019ve had police officers taken off the street, poorly trained, not necessarily with the right skills, then trying to do the job of professional analysts and intelligence experts,\u201d he said.\nBetsy Stanko, an academic who worked in the Met for 11 years, setting up its social science research unit, said that while many police officers were \u201cdesperately trying to do a good job investigating violence to women\u201d, it was time for policing to recognise the scale of the crisis and called for a publicly consulted roadmap to transform the organisation.\n\u201cThe systematic underfunding of policing over the past 10 years has resulted in cuts particularly to the policing of violence against women and girls,\u201d she said. \u201cThe specialist investigative skills identifying patterns of offending have been severely diminished through austerity. Crimes of violence against women and girls need police officers who have specialist skills and knowledge about offenders \u2013 underfunding undermines good policing and demoralises good police officers.\u201d\nBabu said the home secretary, Priti Patel, risked \u201ctinkering around the edges\u201d after announcing an investigation to examine why the former Met police officer Wayne Couzens, who was last week given a whole-life sentence for the murder of Sarah Everard, had not been identified as a sexually aggressive predator. He added his voice to calls for a judge-led public inquiry into wider issues of sexism and women\u2019s access to justice.\n\u201cShockingly, there is not a single person who I meet who does not know a woman who has been the victim of some kind of abuse. That is absolutely appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a Stephen Lawrence moment here, where we acknowledge the way that we\u2019re failing women and young girls. We need a proper inquiry that looks at the wider criminal justice issues and addresses how you make a real change as opposed to tinkering at the edges.\u201d\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, has rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry.\nVictor Olisa, formerly the Met\u2019s most senior black officer and now a criminologist and lecturer, said there had been a \u201cdeafening silence\u201d from police leaders about how they would tackle the failure to address crimes against women and girls.\n\u201cOne of the significant worries about this set of incidents, with Sarah\u2019s tragic murder being the centre of that, is the silence from the chief officers across the country,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard sorry, I\u2019ve heard that Couzens let us down \u2013 but as a public institution, we haven\u2019t heard what the police are going to do about it.\u201d\nHe accused the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, of being slow to reassure the public that action was being taken, adding that the six months between Couzens\u2019 admission of guilt and his sentencing should have been enough time to create a plan of action. The Met has announced an independent inquiry and said it would publish a strategy for tackling violence against women and girls soon.\n\u201cThey need to reassure us that they\u2019re doing something, that they have got a grip, that they have got a plan \u2013 they need to tell us they see a different future,\u201d said Olisa.\nA Home Office spokesperson said the government was recruiting 20,000 police officers, with 9,814 currently in place, had increased funding for policing by up to \u00a3600m in 2021-22 compared to 2020-21, funded a new national policing lead for tackling violence against women and girls and committed \u00a370m to the Safer Streets Fund.\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cProtecting women and girls from violence and abuse is a top priority for this government. That is why the VAWG Strategy, published this summer, sets out the government\u2019s ambition to increase support for survivors, bring perpetrators to justice, and, ultimately, reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls.\u201d",

He was 14 when he made a splash at his first Olympics, in 2008, and at 15 he became a world champion. This year in Tokyo, at his fourth Games, he finally won a longed-for gold, with his synchronised diving partner, Matty Lee. In 2013, Daley came out \u2013 a rarity among professional sportspeople \u2013 and he has become a campaigner for LGBTQ+ rights. Now 27, he is married to the screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, with whom he has a three-year-old son.\nIn a new autobiography, he describes struggles with injury, debilitating anxiety and coping with the death of his father, his biggest champion. Here, one of Britain\u2019s best-loved athletes gamely answers questions from our writer and Guardian readers on all of the above, as well as his other great passion: knitting.\nWhich do you think has had a greater role in your success \u2013 hard work, luck or talent? (Sam, UK)I think it\u2019s work, talent and luck, if I was to put them in order. It\u2019s a lot about hard work, having the right mindset and being able to nurture what nature has given you.\nWhat was your mindset when it came to each of your four Olympics? (Margaret, Canada)In 2008, I didn\u2019t have many expectations; I just wanted to give it my best shot. In 2012, it was about the experience and the home crowd. There was a performance goal, but I also knew that I had more Olympics in me. Going into 2016, it felt like my best chance \u2013 I was in the best possible shape. I put unbearable pressure on myself [Daley won bronze with Dan Goodfellow in the synchronised 10-metre, but didn\u2019t make the final in the individual event]. When I went to 2020, my perspective shifted and the most important thing for me was my family \u2013 knowing they love me and support me, regardless of how I do.\nHow do you stay motivated for so many years? What techniques do you use to get into the zone on competition day? (Meena, US)I try to do 10 minutes\u2019 meditation every day, whether that be breathing work, guided meditation or knitting or crochet. The elusive Olympic gold medal was what was keeping me going, but there\u2019s always something to motivate me. It\u2019s difficult some days, like it is for everyone, but I want to set a good example to [my son] Robbie of working hard, that you don\u2019t just get given things and that your best is OK.\nMy dad said: \u201cIf you go into a competition with 18 people in it and you come last, as long as you do your best, you\u2019re 18th-best in the whole country. How cool is that?\u201d I want to be able to pass that on to Robbie \u2013 it\u2019s not about which medal you win, it\u2019s about the attitude you have.\nWhat does a bad day look like for you? How do you stay optimistic? (Kerish, the Philippines)I need a lot of sleep and I like to eat, so if there\u2019s no food in the house then I will definitely be slightly cranky. Working out, or just going for a walk, turns my mood around. Knitting can also help, or doing something with Robbie.\nOn a bad training day, I used to spiral, but my coach told me to be like Peter Pan and fly out of it. One bad day is a day in a week, in a month, in a year, in a whole career of things that have also gone really well. I try to acknowledge it and then move on. In a competition, each dive is an independent event. You just have to be in the moment.\nHave you ever dived from a board higher than 10 metres? (Adam, UK)Absolutely not. Going up to those 27-metre boards is terrifying. I went up there in Barcelona after the 2013 world championships and it was so high. I was like: how does somebody even jump off this? But it\u2019s extremely exciting to watch.\nYou had BBC Sports Personality of the Year sewn up until the US Open. As a former teenage sports star, what is your message for Emma Raducanu as she begins her life in the spotlight? (Allan, UK)Stay true to who you are and keep working hard. Don\u2019t get distracted by anything and keep striving towards your goals.\nWhat are your views on the sexualisation of athletes in sport, having been pushed as a poster boy and not wearing very much? (Milly, UK)You have these body issues as an athlete. Lots of people would look at athletes and be like: \u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re an athlete, you\u2019re in shape, you have nothing to worry about.\u201d But especially as a diver, you\u2019re up on the diving board and you\u2019re so naked, so visible, so it\u2019s quite hard to be content with your body, because you always want to be better.\nYou wrote about this in your book. Is it fair to say you developed an eating disorder? Would you call it that? (Emine Saner)I used to make myself throw up, in 2012. I weigh myself every day. I\u2019ve had a very strange relationship with food and my body image. I guess it is a mild form of that. Men always seem to not have eating disorders, and it\u2019s hard to talk about it. But I would consider myself to be someone that has very much struggled with body image, and eating, and feeling guilty and shameful of the things that I eat.\nYou also wrote that some of the magazine shoots you did when you were young perhaps wouldn\u2019t be appropriate now. (ES)I don\u2019t know if there would be shoots of maybe 14-, 15-, 16-year-old boys in their trunks, with water thrown all over them, now. I know there definitely wouldn\u2019t be girls doing that. It\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. Looking back, it made me feel more mature; I never felt taken advantage of in any way. I don\u2019t think the body image issues come from anything to do with the media. My body image [issues] came from within my sport \u2013 it was hammered into me that I was overweight and needed to lose weight in order to perform.\nYou have talked about the importance to young people of having LGBTQ+ sporting role models. What effect did it have on you when the Australian diver Matthew Mitcham came out in 2008, before winning gold in Beijing? (Kathryn, UK)He\u2019s been a massive source of inspiration \u2013 he was the first openly gay man to win an Olympic gold medal. He lives in London and we hang out quite often. Being able to have role models is so important; seeing someone like you do well does help motivate you and make you think: \u201cI can do that, too.\u201d\nWhat was life like before and after coming out? (Ian, Singapore)I had to figure out my sexuality very much in the public eye. For me, coming out lifted a weight off my shoulders. It eats you up inside when you\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not, or not even trying to be someone you\u2019re not, but not necessarily being honest. It was terrifying, but at the same time it was like: now I no longer have to hide. It was very much wanting to take control of the situation.\nYou and Lance are vocal about LGBT rights in the UK, the US and the Commonwealth. If you could bring one issue before any politician of your choice, what would it be? (Dorothea, Germany)In terms of sport, I think no country should be able to host any kind of international event unless they have equal rights for LGBT people, for women, for people of colour. There should be a standard, where anyone that wants to go there is going to be safe, supported and not feel threatened for their life. The 2022 football World Cup is in Qatar \u2013 for women and queer people, that can be a dangerous place. After I came out, I didn\u2019t go to Russia [which has homophobic laws] to compete, because I was worried, and then [for the next competition there] I was like: \u201cYou know what? I want to go, to be visible.\u201d That, I think, is more powerful than not going at all. As an athlete, I\u2019m in a safer position, but for people just living their lives in many countries, it\u2019s a scary place to be.\nHow did you meet Lance? (Stefanos, Germany)At dinner in Los Angeles, in March 2013. Our mutual friend brought some friends, of which Lance was one. In that first week, we said we loved each other and we named our children. And here we are, four years married and with a three-year-old son.\nDo you sometimes feel the 20-year age gap between you? (Evgeniya, Russia)Never. If anything, Lance is very much the big kid in the house. I consider myself to be an older soul, hence I have nearly 200 houseplants, and I knit, and I like to be able to have conversations with people who have experienced a similar amount as I have. That\u2019s where Lance and I connected a lot \u2013 he had lost his brother, I\u2019d lost my dad, and then he lost his mum. We\u2019d also experienced the highs of a career [Black won an Oscar in 2009 for his screenplay for Milk] and having that comedown afterwards. That was something we really were able to connect on.\nDo you have any plans for new additions to the family? (Cindy, Myanmar)It\u2019s not quite as easy as a bottle of wine and a good time. A lot of thought has to go into it, but absolutely, I\u2019d love more kids.\nHow difficult was it for you to remain focused on diving during your dad\u2019s illness and death? [Daley\u2019s father, Robert, died in 2011 from a brain tumour.] (Cliff, Mexico)I didn\u2019t allow myself to believe that it was going on, and diving was my outlet to escape from it all. Even after my dad died, I was very much \u201cdiving, diving, diving\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until I met Lance and he said: \u201cYou need to deal with this, you can\u2019t just carry on and pretend that nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d Now I\u2019m able to share memories, do some of the things we used to do together, rather than be like: \u201cI can\u2019t do this, it makes me too sad.\u201d It was extremely tough at the time, all very public, and I felt like I had to be strong for my family. Everybody grieves differently, but I definitely had a delayed grief moment.\nI was so moved to read in your book that your dad\u2019s ashes are buried by the diving board at the London Aquatic Centre. (ES)It was one of those things that only I knew during London 2012. That\u2019s why I put my water bottle there; I still put my bottle there whenever I train. He got the best seat in the house \u2013 no parents are allowed poolside during diving competitions, let alone the Olympics. It was very special to me that I won my first Olympic medal in that pool.\nThe diving facilities at my local pool closed and a new leisure centre was built without one. There is no chance that my children will take up diving. What can be done to make diving accessible to the next generation of Olympians? (Richard, UK)There are more 10-metre diving facilities than ever before in the UK, but lots of smaller facilities are being closed. I started the Tom Daley Diving Academy, which is now across pools without diving boards, teaching people the basics off the side. You can get a feel for diving and then if someone is good and is talent-scouted, they can move to diving pools. I\u2019d like to see more leisure centres that have, not even 10-metre facilities, but if you can have 1-metre, 3-metre and 5-metre boards, that is great for beginners.\nHow did you keep up training during lockdown? (Sarah, UK)I was doing somersaults on to sofa cushions. I had a spin bike, a treadmill; I would occasionally go for runs, do Zoom workouts. I ordered things to be delivered, like weights, but they took for ever because everybody wanted them. It allowed me to focus on things I never would usually, like time to stretch and all those things that really help.\nHow often do you and Matty Lee speak? And have either of you decided on 2024? (Curtis, US)Matty is actually living in my house [in London] while I\u2019m in Calgary [where Black is making a TV show]. He was meant to be out by the time I get back, but I\u2019m going to be living with him for a month. We speak all the time. An individual gold would have been amazing, but there\u2019s almost something more special about the synchro, because you get to share that moment with someone.\nNo decisions have been made about 2024. If I\u2019d won a gold medal in 2016, I planned to retire, because I didn\u2019t think, as an older athlete, I was ever going to be as good. I\u2019m still very much on an upward trajectory.\nWhat got you into knitting? (Matilda, UK)My coach always wanted me to sit down, rest, recover. Because I\u2019m one of those people always up doing something, Lance said some people on [TV sets], while they\u2019re waiting between takes, will knit. I was terrible at it, got a bit of info from YouTube and a couple of divers on the international scene helped me, and then all of a sudden I was obsessed with it. Every new project was a new technique to learn. It\u2019s what I do whenever I have a moment. I used to be a massive nail biter and now I don\u2019t bite my nails, because that fidgeting is gone.\nIf you had to give an athlete one of your knits, what would it be? (Lauriane, France)Maybe I\u2019ll knit Usain Bolt a full running leotard \u2013 green, gold and black. It might be a bit heavy, though.\nWill you be competing in next year\u2019s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham? (Roseanne, UK)I want to take a longer break and I think, by the time I get back to training, I will have missed the qualification event. Unless our director says: \u201cWe know you can do it, so you\u2019re qualified already,\u201d but, otherwise, probably not.\nWhich other Olympic sports would you most and least like to compete in? (Susan, UK)Something I\u2019d already have some ability in would be gymnastics, but I\u2019d love to do luge or skeleton, or bobsleigh. Least appealing? Swimming. Watching it is fine, but the training \u2013 swimming up and down, looking at a black line on the bottom of the pool \u2013 is not appealing to me.\nDo you plan to turn your knitting hobby into a business? (Netasha, Malaysia)I\u2019d love to work out a way of getting more people into knitting, just for the mindfulness element \u2013 and to be able to make your own clothes would be better than all the fast fashion.\nWhere do you see yourself in five years? (Alexandra, Canada)I\u2019d love to have a successful knitwear business and be established as a TV host.

Faced with large sections of the coastline it owns being undermined and overwhelmed by the sea, it is creating salt marshes and allowing sand dunes to migrate inland.\nMany of its rangers go about on electric bikes and use battery-powered tools rather than diesel or petrol, thus cutting pollution and giving visitors a quieter time. It is all part of the ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030.\nPlanting 20m trees in the next 10 years is not just a token carbon capture plan but a way of reducing flood risk, preventing landslides, creating shade at properties that overheat in summer and providing more homes for wildlife.\nWhat the National Trust has never been a campaigning organisation. It has been careful to avoid politics, fearing a backlash from governments. However, a greater danger is now the future of its properties. It has tried the gentle approach by inviting ministers to threatened sites to see what can be done, but now, impatient with government indifference, is supporting the Climate Coalition.

        "content": "Hans Grundberg must recognise more than two factions involved in conflict,  says pro-independence group\nThe new UN special envoy to Yemen has been urged to broaden negotiations to end the country\u2019s seven-year civil war and include the pro-independence Southern Transitional Council and other factions.\nSpeaking to the Guardian from Aden, the head of the STC foreign affairs directorate, Mohammed al-Ghaithi, said the UN must recognise that outdated security council resolutions were restricting their efforts.\nThe current mandate of the UN envoy Hans Grundberg \u2013 based on a resolution passed in 2015 \u2013 focuses on the internationally recognised Yemen government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the leadership of the northern-based Houthi leadership.\nMany observers say the conflict has long stopped being a battle confined to two forces within Yemen but involves a variety of actors, making a single national solution harder to achieve.\nAppointed special envoy last month, Grundberg, a Swede and former EU ambassador to Yemen, travelled to the southern capital Aden this week despite weekend fighting in the city that left six dead and 30 injured.\nGrundberg made a point of not just meeting the prime minister of the Saudi-backed Hadi government but also the STC chairman Aidarous al-Zubaidi, as well as other actors. He stressed his commitment to inclusivity afterwards, saying \u201cYemen has a rich history of political and social diversity. A durable solution is one that reflects the interests of diverse and broad segments of Yemeni society.\u201d\nUnder an agreement with Hadi signed under Saudi supervision in 2019, the STC was supposed to join a power-sharing government in the south, merge security forces and form a joint body to negotiate with the Houthis.\nRivalries have stopped most of this happening, arguably making it easier for the Houthis to advance towards strategically vital towns in the north such as Marib, a city of 3 million Yemenis.\nYemen was unified in 1990, and elements across the six governates in the south have always resented the loss of independence from the north.\nAl-Ghaithi said: \u201cIt is crucial that the negotiations need to reflect the realities on the ground. Without southern representation there can be no practical peace plan in Yemen \u2026\n\u201cThe problem with UN resolution 2216 is that it presumes there are only two warring parties on the ground when the reality is otherwise. When the UN is seriously thinking about ceasefire, safe passage of humanitarian workers and the country\u2019s economic future, it is imperative that it takes into consideration all the parties on the ground and amongst them is the STC.\u201d\nThe STC said it is willing to test opinion in the south in a binding referendum. It argues: \u201cIf the British government was able to give a referendum to the people of Scotland so the people of the south in Yemen can have one.\u201d\nThe STC also warned that the Iranian-backed Houthis were making military progress in some parts of the south under the control of the Hadi forces, endangering the routes into Marib \u2013 the last strategically important town not under Houthi control in the north.\nThe city and province has been under some form of bloody Houthi assault for more than a year. Marib lies about 120km (75 miles) east of the capital Sana\u2019a, which the Houthis seized along with most of north Yemen in 2014 when they ousted Hadi.\nThere have been many thousands of casualties on both sides, with the Iranian-backed Houthi advance held back by Saudi air power and resistance within the city.\nAl-Ghaithi said the stakes are high for the Saudis. \u201cIf the Houthis win, it will represent a threat to American energy interests, to Saudi Arabia and to the whole of the Gulf. The Iranians that back the Houthis will not stop at Sana\u2019a. They want to go all the way to Mecca, and they think the road to Mecca lies through Aden. The Saudis know very well what comes after the fall of Aden.\u201d",

Then finally, sensationally, he experimented on himself by having an electrode implanted inside his brain in a Belize clinic that specialises in medical tourism.\nKennedy did this to measure the ways in which brainwaves can be harnessed to external computing capacity, helping people with locked-in syndrome or ALS, for example, although what was specifically achieved by implant surgery on himself isn\u2019t clear. This brief documentary is a partial introduction to the man and his work and it seeks to rescue Kennedy from his wacky reputation, to downplay the maverick side of his personality (there is no mention of his self-published sci-fi novel called 2051) and it doesn\u2019t dwell on the fact that Kennedy is now regarded as somewhat eccentric by mainstream neuroscientists \u2013 although disruptors, pioneers and original thinkers are very often people just like him.\nThis film about him provides food for thought, though: authors such as Mark O\u2019Connell are interviewed about the prospects for techno-homo sapiens, a transhuman evolutionary phase in which human beings become, effectively, wedded to computers. \u201cCellphones inside our heads\u201d, is how someone imagines the future. So there are two implications: for sick people with ALS whose lives can be made better, and perfectly healthy people whose lives can be made \u2026 what? Even better? Superhuman? Or less than human? Dangerously dependent for outsourced memory and cognitive capacity on computers which could go wrong?\nWell, Kennedy says these ideas are here to stay.

        "content": "From atmospheric Berlin to Joyce\u2019s Trieste, via Marseille\u2019s markets and a wellbeing walk in Copenhagen, city strolls reward the curious rambler\nThe art of fl\u00e2neur-ing might be French and its most famous practitioners Parisians, but other European cultures have walking traditions, from the Italian passeggiata and Spanish paseo \u2013 social promenades to take the air as dusk falls \u2013 to German wanderlust: hiking with desire. Nothing opens up a city like a long ramble on foot. It\u2019s the only way to make a place your own and unearth discoveries not listed in guidebooks or apps.\nFor all that it is mainstream, even fashionable, and was a favourite with no-frills flying weekenders before the pandemic, Berlin remains a strange, sometimes alienating city. This is especially the case when you go walking around its historic heart, where the Berlin Wall stood from 1961 to 1989. While unified Germany has thrown many millions at the city and tried to fill this former site of espionage, tension and trauma with newbuilds and showy upgrades, such as Norman Foster\u2019s glass dome for the Reichstag, swathes of the area remain open to the sky. This accentuates a feeling of emptiness in what is a relatively unpopulous capital city \u2013 3.6 million, around a third of London \u2013 and also allows the mental space to conjure Berlin\u2019s many ghosts.\nVague, unplanned walks around the former East and West will still evince differences \u2013 the tank-friendly width of Karl-Marx-Allee, the glitzy shops along the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm \u2013 but if you want to chart a route, I\u2019d recommend a wander taking in the following: the Hansa Quarter (Hansaviertel), a showcase estate where renowned architects (including Alvar Aalto, Walter Gropius, Arne Jacobsen and Oscar Niemeyer) designed modernist residential buildings at a site destroyed in the second world war; the Tiergarten inner-city park; Alexanderplatz, which still exudes something of the old East; and Prenzlauer Berg, where there are nice coffee shops and lunch spots. Berlin is big, but you can always hop on an S-bahn train for the return journey. If you fancy a hike outside the central districts, wander down to former Tempelhof airport, where the narratives of Nazi Germany, the Berlin airlift and modern migration crisscross like contrails.\nWhile he was imagining the Dublin perambulations of Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus that would provide the two plotlines of Ulysses, James Joyce was doing his real walking around the city of Trieste. The august, oft-overlooked port on the Adriatic is a perfect place for the activity, partly because it has much-loved cafes \u2013 some beautiful, all convivial \u2013 that serve as pit-stops, but also because it has such a splendid seafront.\nOne of the grander cafes, the Caff\u00e8 degli Specchi stands on the main square, the Piazza Unit\u00e0 d\u2019Italia. This is a natural place to start a zigzagging walk, taking in the Joyce museum, the art collection and sumptuous interiors at the Museo Revoltella, the graceful Borgo Teresiano, named after the 18th-century Habsburg ruler Maria Theresa, and the Caff\u00e8 San Marco, a spacious bookshop-cafe with an interior in the Vienna secession style (and upwards of 50 types of cups of coffee available \u2013 as Trieste has long been at the centre of the bean-importing trade). From the centre, it\u2019s a short, steep walk up to Villa Opicina for a view over the Gulf of Trieste. If you have energy for more walking, continue along the wooded gravel path of the Strada Napoleonica towards Prosecco. It\u2019s 5km if you go the whole way; you\u2019ll see the Castello di Miramare, the summerhouse of Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and his wife, Charlotte, at the foot of the cliff. You can come back along a different footpath.\nThe ancient French city has it all: the sea-facing Vieux-Port, the narrow, winding streets of the Le Panier neighbourhood, the sweeping view from the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde, and the Rue de la Re\u0301publique quarter, with its Haussmannien girth and grand mid-19th-century buildings. Just three blocks in from the port is march\u00e9 Noailles, where you can sample fresh produce and sniff the spices at the daily march\u00e9 des capucins, and have mint tea or a kebab, flatbread and couscous. Follow the front round to the Mucem (Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations) \u2013 but make sure to check out some of the city\u2019s smaller museums, too.\nIn his essay Hashish in Marseilles, philosopher and urbanist Walter Benjamin recounted an evening strolling around cafes after consuming the drug: \u201cI now suddenly understood how to be a painter \u2013 had it not happened to Rembrandt and many others? \u2013 ugliness could appear as the true reservoir of beauty, better than any treasure cask, a jagged mountain with all the inner gold of beauty gleaming from the wrinkles, glances, features.\u201d Visitors today are unlikely to find Marseille particularly ugly, but it is a somewhat disorderly city and run-down districts rub up against more well-heeled ones. If hashish isn\u2019t your thing, then artisanal pastis \u2013 all the rage right now \u2013 will do just as well to blur the edges.\nTowns spread out over steep hills can make for arduous ambling, especially if dressed in your best city gear and the sun is up. The streets that climb up and down Alfama, Bairro Alto and Chiado benefit from their narrowness \u2013 you can usually find shade. Lisbon is one of those cities where the least attention-seeking restaurants serve some of the best food, and it pays to stray away from the honeypots and find where locals are having lunch. Fish is usually excellent, and for comfort food it\u2019s hard to top dishes such as bacalhau \u00e0 br\u00e1s (salt cod with egg and potatoes), grilled sardines or cataplana (white fish and seafood stew).\nOn your wanderings, you\u2019ll come upon lovely bars and cafes, some of which fill with the melancholy strains of live fado after dark. The late, great fado singer Carlos do Carmo, on his landmark 1997 album, Um Homen na Cidade (A Man in the City), intones on the title track, \u201cI grab the dawn, as if it were a child \u2026 I go down the street of the moon.\u201d The Portuguese capital is at its best at the top and bottom of the day, before the streets steam with people and sunshine. Lisbon has suffered the woes of overtourism in recent years. Do Carmo\u2019s album namechecks many city landmarks and if your Portuguese is up to it, you might try out a situationist experiment and use fado lyrics as your map and guide \u2013 it\u2019s sure to take you away from the hubbub.\nA local academic told me that S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard always enjoyed walking on the shady side of the street. Even if it\u2019s an apocryphal anecdote, it chimes with the moodier, morose side of the famous Danish theologian and proto-existential philosopher. For all that, he did once write, \u201cAbove all, do not lose your desire to walk. Every day, I walk myself into a state of wellbeing and walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.\u201d His home city, famous as being among the most cycle-friendly in the world, is also kind to those who take off on two feet.\nStart a bookish walk at the Assistens Cemetery. It\u2019s not the least bit gloomy; locals come here to relax, have picnics and enjoy the lush foliage. Kierkegaard and Copenhagen\u2019s other \u2013 even more famous \u2013 writer, Hans Christian Andersen, are buried here. Beyond the walls is the N\u00f8rrebro district, full of designer clothing stores and galleries, murals and craft beer outlets \u2013 the kind of superficial, fun things Kierkegaard would have hated. From here, drift thoughtfully towards the harbour area, passing through the delightful green space of the Royal Library Garden en route and popping into the Royal Library, AKA Black Diamond library, due its dramatic form, which has a great collection of manuscripts on show. For a bite to eat or a drink, choose between the Paludan Bogcaf\u00e9 and the opulent Library Bar at the Plaza hotel \u2013 known for its Chesterfield chairs, jazz gigs and excellent cocktails.\nThe historic core of Seville is quite compact, but if you take in Triana, across the Guadalquivir, and the Isla de la Cartuja, which hosted the 1992 Expo, you have a sprawl to take on. As with all of Andaluc\u00eda\u2019s tourist-friendly spots, Seville gets its fair share of moochers and souvenir-browsers. It\u2019s all too easy to join the throng of lost souls. One way to impose a degree of design on your outing is to undertake part of the route for which the city is famous: the Holy Week procession. The cofrades (religious fraternities), in their disarming pointed hats, gravitate to the centre from parishes all over the city, but are all funnelled into the last few streets, from Calle Campana, down Calle Sierpes, across Plaza de San Francisco, along the Avenida de la Constituci\u00f3n, concluding at the cathedral. Next door is the Real Alc\u00e1zar, a complex of palaces, fortifications, patios, reflective pools and beautiful gardens and olive groves laid out on a neat grid. A complicated melding of mud\u00e9jar and other European architectural styles, the site was developed in the 11th century, when Seville was under the rule of the Arab Muslim Abb\u0101did dynasty; it was added to and modified many times on its way to becoming a Christian royal residence.\nCross the river to enter Triana for contrast: once extra muros, this insular district has links with Seville\u2019s glory days as a port, as well as its ceramics industry, matadors, flamenco artists and Roma people. Local cults honour the Virgen de la Esperanza (Virgin of Hope), whose image is kept in the Sailors\u2019 Chapel, and the Cristo de Expiraci\u00f3n (Christ of the Last Breath) \u2013 whose statue in the namesake church on Calle Castilla is said to be the likeness of a stabbed Roma man, the sculptor Francisco Ruiz Gij\u00f3n, found in the streets here in the 1680s. Triana is loveliest from dusk, when you can get a fino or a cold beer on the riverside of Calle Betis before heading into the bowels of the barrio to find tapas and flamenco.\n The headline to this article was amended on 7 October 2021.

He said China\u2019s recent incursions into Taiwan\u2019s air defence zone made it even more important that \u201cfellow democracies stand shoulder to shoulder with you\u201d.\nThe ex-prime minister, speaking a day before he is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech to a regional conference, appeared to describe Taiwan as a \u201ccountry\u201d \u2013 a position opposed by China which considers it a renegade province.\n\u201cIt is in large measure to try to help to end this isolation from which Taiwan has been suffering for so many decades that I am here in this country and I do hope that this will be the first of many visits,\u201d Abbott said.\nUnder the Australian government\u2019s one-China policy, Australia does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state, and therefore dealings between government officials take place unofficially. But Canberra has flagged its support for deeper ties, particularly on the economic front.\nThe Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters in Canberra on Thursday that Abbott was \u201ca private citizen\u201d visiting Taiwan in a private capacity.\nBut Taiwan considered the trip significant enough to grant Abbott a meeting with Tsai on Thursday and the event was also attended by Jenny Bloomfield, the representative of the Australian Office in Taipei.\nDuring an exchange broadcast by the presidential office, Tsai said she wanted to extend a warm welcome to Abbott on his first trip to Taiwan. She hoped the visit would \u201cfacilitate even more cooperation and understanding between Taiwan and Australia\u201d.\nTsai thanked Abbott for voicing support for an economic cooperation agreement between Australia and Taiwan and for backing Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\u201cYour statements on the importance of a secure and peaceful Taiwan Strait are also greatly appreciated,\u201d she said.\nAbbott, in turn, described Taiwan as a model for the wider world and \u201ccertainly a model for so many countries in this part of the world\u201d.\nTaiwan, he said, had \u201ctransformed from an impoverished dictatorship into a vibrant, dynamic, pluralist democracy\u201d.\n\u201cYou have demonstrated to all of the countries of this region that it is possible to be both rich and free and it is possible to have both liberty and democracy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOf course not everyone and not everywhere is pleased [by] Taiwan\u2019s progress and I do note that Taiwan is challenged on an almost daily basis by its giant neighbour. It\u2019s more important than ever, under such circumstances, that your fellow democracies stand shoulder to shoulder with you.\u201d\nAbbott said the best thing that countries like Australia could do for Taiwan was to try to build an \u201cever deeper relationship across the board\u201d but particularly in trade.\n\u201cIf I may say so, perhaps in recent times countries like Australia have overemphasised fostering democracy in places where it has never taken root and underemphasised protecting democracy in places where it has. It\u2019s important that we get the balance right in the future.\u201d\nAbbott said he could not think of a stronger signal of democracies standing shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan than accepting Taiwan\u2019s accession to the CPTPP.\n\u201cObviously I can\u2019t make specific commitments on behalf of the Australian government, but I am confident that I do speak for the entire Australian people when I say that as a people we wish the people of Taiwan to continue to flourish in peace and in freedom.\u201d\nTsai had earlier noted the Australian government had been \u201cactively adjusting its strategies in response to geopolitical changes in the Indo-Pacific region\u201d and had backed Taiwan\u2019s international participation.\n\u201cTaiwan is willing to contribute to upholding regional peace and stability,\u201d she told Abbott, who was Australia\u2019s prime minister from 2013 to 2015. \u201cWe seek to deepen collaboration with other freedom-loving democracies in such areas as vaccines, emerging technologies, climate change and supply chains.\u201d\nAbbott began his remarks by thanking Tsai for her \u201cwonderfully warm and deeply courteous welcome\u201d but also took a swipe at face masks.\n\u201cI am looking forward to my next trip to Taiwan, a trip where I\u2019m sure it will be possible to enjoy the bounty of this wonderful place, where, please God, we won\u2019t be required to wear these wretched masks any more,\u201d he said on Thursday.\n\u201cOn that note though, I should congratulate Taiwan for being the one place on Earth which has best tamed this Covid beast and has managed to do it without any major restrictions on economic activity and human freedom.\u201d\nTaiwan remained largely Covid-free during the pandemic, after shutting its borders to non-residents early, enacting strict quarantine measures, and encouraging widespread mask-wearing. Taiwan currently requires all entrants to quarantine in a hotel at their own cost or in a government facility.\nDuring its largest outbreak earlier this year, Taiwan went into a soft lockdown, ordering public sporting venues, adult and entertainment venues, and restaurants to close \u2013 except for takeaway. The more than three-month shutdown was widely followed but did prompt complaints from some business owners, particularly in hospitality, who were devastated by the economic hit.\n\u2013 additional reporting Helen Davidson in Taipei",

        "content": "Courtney Vandersloot and the Chicago Sky are back in the WNBA finals for the first time since 2014 thanks in big part to Candace Parker\u2019s decision to come home.\nVandersloot scored 19 points and Kahleah Copper added 18 to help the Sky beat the top-seeded Connecticut Sun 79-69 on Wednesday night.\n\u201cWe were missing one piece, and it was Candace Parker,\u201d Vandersloot said. \u201cWe knew what she brought to us. She was going to take us to this point right here. Whether we win a championship or not, she changed this franchise.\u201d\nParker, who returned home to Chicago this season after spending the first 13 years of her career in Los Angeles, finished with 17 points, nine rebounds and seven assists.\n\u201cIt feels unbelievable,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a full circle moment. To look up in the stands and just see all the people that I started playing basketball in front of. It\u2019s super special.\u201d\nChicago was .500 during the regular season, but a big reason was that Parker was sidelined for the first part of the year with an ankle injury. Once she returned, the team started to get going.\nThe Sky jumped all over Connecticut behind Vandersloot. She hit two threes to help build a 13-2 advantage less than three minutes into the first quarter. Her ability to connect from long-range helped transform Chicago\u2019s offensive approach in the game.\n\u201cShe was knocking down the three, and I think it just makes us a different ballclub,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe always preach to be aggressive. We\u2019re a different team when that happens, and I just love the way she adjusts.\u201d\nThe Sky, who held a seven-point lead heading into the fourth quarter, opened the period with an 8-2 run to put the game away.\nJonquel Jones led the way for the Sun with 25 points and 11 rebounds. Natisha Hiedeman added 16 points off the bench, hitting five 3-pointers.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say exactly why we didn\u2019t come out with that enthusiasm and energy that we needed,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think it was definitely a big factor. Shots just weren\u2019t falling.\u201d\nConnecticut were able to trim the deficit to three in the second quarter, but the Sky then finished the half on a 16-6 run. The Sun would never get closer than that the rest of the way.\nIt was the first time that the No 1 seed hasn\u2019t reached the finals since the WNBA changed its playoff format in 2016.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a sad and disappointed locker room,\u201d Sun coach Curt Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a disappointing eight-day stretch where we just were out-coached, we were out-played. It just felt like we were always on our heels this series.\u201d\nChicago native Chance the Rapper and Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen took in the game from courtside.\n\u201cScottie Pippen was at our game today. He\u2019s the next best thing to Ron Harper in my eyes since Ron Harper was my hero growing up,\u201d Parker said. \u201cChance the Rapper, Jessie Jackson. We had people come out constantly to our games.\u201d\nOn the other side of the bracket, the Las Vegas Aces are back in business after staving off elimination in their own WNBA semi-final tie.\nChelsea Gray scored 22 points and the Aces used a massive third quarter run to beat the Phoenix Mercury 93-76 on Wednesday night, evening their best-of-five series at two-all.\n\u201cIt was just a change in attitude,\u201d said Aces guard Kelsey Plum, who had 20 points and six assists. \u201cFor us to get beat the way we did the previous two games, it\u2019s humbling. You have to look at what can I do better as an individual, what can I do to help the team and I\u2019m really proud everyone just bought in tonight.\u201d\nThe Aces got off to a good start for the first time in three games and ran away from the Mercury with a 26-2 run to begin the third quarter.\nA\u2019ja Wilson bounced back from a shaky Game 3 with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Riquna Williams provided a lift with 17 points. Gray hit four 3s and Las Vegas shot 11 of 22 from the arc to set up a decisive Game 5 Friday in Las Vegas. The winner faces the Chicago Sky after they took out the Connecticut Sun in four games.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we play basketball,\u201d Aces coach Bill Laimbeer said.\nPhoenix had to play without guard Sophie Cunningham due to a calf strain, then lost guard Kim Nurse to a right knee injury 39 seconds into the game.\nThe Mercury were sharp early, thanks to a lift from Shey Peddy (13 points), but were disjointed at both ends during the Aces\u2019 third-quarter run.\nDiana Taurasi and Skylar Diggins-Smith had 14 points each to lead Phoenix.\n\u201cYou knew they were going to respond and today we knew that coming,\u201d Taurasi said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t the things done that you need to beat a really good team.\u201d\nLas Vegas won the series\u2019 first game, but the Mercury won in consecutive routs to take a 2-1 series lead.\nPhoenix set WNBA records for points (117) and points in a half (68) to win Game 2, then played one of its best all-around games of the season to move within one win of its first WNBA finals since winning the 2014 title.",

Lord Monckton and Prof Plimer were only given a comparatively short time to speak \u2026 at the end of their speeches, the question [about] human-induced climate change was re-asked, and the hands changed, about 30% put their hands up.\u201d\nRinehart called for the school to \u201cstrongly guard against propaganda intruding on real education and rational thinking\u201d, and told students to \u201cdo their own independent research\u201d on \u201cwhich comes first \u2013 global warming, or an increase in carbon?\u201d.\nShe concluded the speech by extensively quoting the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, including the line that the \u201cproblem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people\u2019s money\u201d.\nBut the speech was not run in full by the school, prompting claims of censorship by spokespeople for the mining billionaire.\nIn a statement to the West Australian newspaper, her spokesperson said it was \u201cvery unusual for Mrs Rinehart to be asked to give the keynote speech, then the morning of the speech be told it would in effect be censored\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very sad to see after the school\u2019s fine history of education over more than a century [that it is now] subject to the political views of its new headmistress,\u201d the spokesperson reportedly said.\nBut the school said the video sent by Rinehart had been \u201cmuch longer than the allotted five minutes\u201d and the school was \u201conly able to play the first five minutes which shared her recollections of her time at the school\u201d.\n\u201cI can confirm that the messaging in the video was not shared in its entirety with the students at this assembly,\u201d a school spokesperson said in a statement.\n\u201cThe School encourages our students to think critically and analyse all facts presented to them, particularly in this age of the internet. The School does not endorse the personal views shared in the full video.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\n \u201cWe encourage critical thinking and discussion on controversial topics, ensuring that there are opposing views to motivate purposeful conversation. An historical birthday celebration assembly was not the context or the time.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said the school\u2019s science curriculum \u201cfollows the guidelines set out by the West Australian School Curriculum and Standards Authority\u201d.\nRinehart\u2019s speech has been criticised by climate change experts, including the Climate Council spokesperson and ANU emeritus professor Will Steffen, who said \u201cthe science is settled on climate change\u201d.\n\u201cAustralia prides itself on having a quality education system \u2013 one of the best in the world. It is important that schools stick to the most reputable science about climate change, as embodied in the latest IPCC report,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn this case, the school stuck to the science-based curriculum, which is increasingly important with the amount of misinformation flying around.\n \u201cYoung people have so much moral authority because it\u2019s their future that we\u2019re risking by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\u201d\n \u201cA few weeks out from Cop26, the rest of the world, our states and territories, farmers, industries, parents, and most importantly, the young people of Australia want to see stronger action on climate change. That means committing to strong and urgent emissions cuts this decade.\u201d",

But the ESO said a worst-case scenario, such as multiple power plant outages, low wind speeds, and a bitterly cold winter, could cause the margin plunge to just 4.2%, or 2.5GW.\nThat would be well below the 5.1% it forecast in 2015, before a notoriously difficult winter when National Grid was forced to ask businesses to reduce their electricity usage to keep the lights on.\nWith margins likely to be tighter than the Grid would like, it expects to issue a similar number of electricity market notices to last year, when it sent six of the official pleas to energy suppliers to increase the amount of electricity they make available.\nThe ESO took the unusual step this year of issuing an early version of its Winter Outlook, its annual assessment of Great Britain\u2019s electricity safety net.\nIt said at the time that the margin could fall to 5.3%, owing to the retirements of the Dungeness B and Hunterston B nuclear power stations and shutdowns at the Baglan Bay, Severn Power and Sutton Bridge gas power stations.\nBut its worst-case scenario has worsened since September, when a large fire affected the IFA high-voltage power cables importing electricity from France. Half of the 2GW cable is expected to be unavailable until March.\nDespite the downgrade, National Grid said there was no risk of blackouts as a result of the tighter margin.\nFintan Slye, the executive directive of ESO, said: \u201cThe Winter Outlook confirms that we expect to have sufficient capacity and the tools needed to meet demand this winter. Margins are well within the reliability standard and therefore we are confident that there will be enough capacity available to keep Britain\u2019s lights on.\u201d\nHowever, speaking at an event hosted by the Financial Times on Wednesday, the National Grid chief executive, John Pettigrew, said the gap between supply and demand could be smaller than in recent years.\nTighter margins can lead to higher bills as the Grid faces the excess cost of paying energy suppliers more for extra supplies to top up the backup margin.",

        "content": "Competition and Markets Authority ends four-month investigation saying it cannot justify expense\nThe competition regulator has dropped its investigation into whether British Airways and Ryanair broke the law by failing to offer refunds to customers who could not legally take their flights because of coronavirus restrictions \u2013 but said the airlines should have given them their money back.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was scrapping its four-month investigation because of a \u201clack of clarity in the law [which] makes it insufficiently certain that it would be able to secure refunds for customers\u201d.\nDuring periods of lockdown, when non-essential travel was banned in parts of the UK, the two airlines refused to give refunds to customers. Instead British Airways, which is owned by IAG, offered vouchers or rebooking, while Ryanair offered travellers only the option to rebook.\nThe CMA launched the investigation into BA and Ryanair in June, citing concerns that failing to offer refunds might have breached consumer law.\nHowever, the regulator said on Thursday the protracted time a court battle would take, coupled with the uncertainty of winning, meant it could no longer justify the expense of pursuing the case.\n\u201cWe strongly believe people who are legally prevented from taking flights due to lockdown laws should be offered a full refund and we launched this investigation in the hope that we would be able to secure a positive outcome for consumers,\u201d said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA.\n\u201cHowever, after considering the relevant law and gathering evidence in our investigation, we have concluded that the length of time that would be required to take this through the courts, and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money.\u201d\nThe CMA added that given the importance of the failure to refund consumers who had \u201cunfairly lost out\u201d it hoped consumer law in this area would be clarified.\nWhich? was scathing in its assessment of the airlines\u2019 behaviour and said the CMA should be given greater powers, including the ability to fine airlines.\nRory Boland, the travel editor at the consumer watchdog, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hugely unfair that passengers have been left to shoulder the bill for following the law and protecting public health by staying at home.\n\u201cMeanwhile British Airways and Ryanair have been allowed to hold on to their cash for flights people could not legally take. The government must urgently set out how it plans to review travel regulations and strengthen consumer protections. Consumers are being let down.\u201d\nBritish Airways said it had acted lawfully at all times during the pandemic, issuing nearly 4m refunds and offering \u201chighly flexible booking policies enabling millions of our customers to change their travel dates or destinations\u201d.\nRyanair welcomed the decision to end the investigation, pointing out that \u201cpassengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee, and many availed of this option\u201d.\nThe CMA originally launched an investigation into the wider airline sector in December 2020, after reports that consumers were being denied refunds for flights they were not legally able to take.",

        "content": "The Florida-based athlete has the fastest-known marathon time for a double-leg amputee\nMarko Cheseto will line up for Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon with justified confidence: he has the fastest known time for a double-leg amputee: 2 hours 37 minutes and 23 seconds. In other words, Cheseto is capable of running six-minute miles for just over 26 miles.\nThe journey he took to get to this stage took him across two continents and through immense physical and emotional pain.\nCheseto\u2019s athletic career began as a boy in Kenya, when he still had both of his feet. He was inspired by Tegla Loroupe, the first African woman to hold the world marathon record and win the New York City Marathon, who also happened to be his aunt.\nCheseto was later recruited to run at the University of Alaska, where he ran the 5k and 10k. He also convinced his coach to recruit his cousin and close friend, William Ritekwiang. But in 2011 Ritekwiang took his own life, and Cheseto blamed himself for not being able to help.\nOne night, deep in grief, Cheseto took some antidepressants, went for a run in the woods, and blacked out. He had overdosed. He woke up in the snow three days later, unable to feel his legs. His feet were frostbitten and developed gangrene, and his legs had to be amputated below the knee.\nHis world had shifted. He was fitted with walking prostheses. At first, Cheseto didn\u2019t think running would be in his future. He had never seen anyone wearing prostheses, and he had never heard of the Paralympics.\nBut he started running again in 2012 on his walking prostheses. Although they were not made for running, it felt good, he says. He decided not to let the trauma of losing his cousin and his feet get the best of him. \u201cI was trying to find a purpose in life, something that I could be proud of,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd running was that.\u201d\nIn 2013, he received his first running prostheses from the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF). Running blades can cost $15,000 each, and they need to be highly specialized for each person.\nCheseto decided to try to qualify for the 2016 Paralympics in sprinting events, but that didn\u2019t work out, so he shifted course to the marathon. His first was the 2018 New York Marathon, and his second was Boston in 2019.\nRunning is not merely an athletic pursuit for Cheseto, however. CAF and the prosthesis maker \u00d6ssur hold running clinics around the country, and Cheseto has volunteered at them over the years, helping amputees learn to run.\n\u201cAt first, running was for me. I wanted to do this for my own sanity,\u201d Cheseto says. But he soon realized that other people related to what he had been through. \u201cThe only difference between me and so many people that I have talked to and have shared their pain is that mine is physical pain. I am not saying I don\u2019t have internal struggles and pains just like everyone else \u2026 but my physical wounds helped people to feel comfortable sharing their pain.\u201d\nBob Babbitt, co-founder of CAF, is a keen admirer of Cheseto. \u201cWhen somebody is going through trauma, somebody is lying in a hospital bed and they turn on the TV and they see Marko running, it gives people hope,\u201d he says. \u201cNot every double amputee is going to run a 2:37 marathon, but knowing the opportunity is there \u2013 that is huge.\u201d\nCheseto also works with amputees in his job as a technician at Prosthetic & Orthotic Associates, a company that fits patients with prostheses and that he joined after receiving his own prosthetic care there for years. \u201cThat ability to be able to help someone else get a walking or running leg was just so rewarding,\u201d he says.\nBut Cheseto knows there are still challenges for athletes like him. One example came in February 2020, when he was competing at the Disney Princess Half Marathon, which he had hopes of winning. The race has separate categories for athletes with disabilities and those without. Cheseto said that before the race, the race director, Jon Hughes, told him that if he finished first overall, he wouldn\u2019t be recognized as the overall winner.\nFor his part, Hughes says he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to have Cheseto in the race but there were concerns his prostheses might give him an unfair advantage. Hughes says he reached out to USA Track & Field for guidance, \u201cand the bottom line is, we could not get anything definitive.\u201d In the end, Cheseto finished fourth overall despite one of his prostheses coming off during the race.\nCheseto is adamant that victory would have been deserved. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing advantageous about me losing my feet, and I\u2019m talking from an experience of having been an able-bodied athlete for more than 20 years.\u201d\nStan Patterson, who owns Prosthetic & Orthotic Associates (POA), the company Cheseto works for, backs up the athlete\u2019s stance. \u201cAnyone saying that an amputee has advantages running a marathon on a portion of their anatomy that is not meant to have loading forces applied, and on a unstable platform, really does not understand biomechanics and prosthetics,\u201d Patterson says.\nAt major marathons, where the presence of the best runners in the world means overall victory is out of reach, the problem is different. Cheseto has never run in a marathon that recognizes him as the fastest in his classification. At the 2019 Chicago Marathon, when Cheseto ran a world best, no race officials acknowledged his achievement when he crossed the finish line. That will change in Boston, which has added its first-ever competitive para athletics divisions, alongside its existing competitive wheelchair division.\n\u201cYou can have Paralympic gold medalists or athletes who have competed in the World Para Athletics Championships, and yet they come to a major marathon, and they\u2019re just tossed into more of a participatory or adaptive program\u201d and not recognized as the world-class athletes they are, said Marla Runyan, an Olympian and Paralympian, and formerly the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) para athlete manager.\nThe new para athletics divisions are vision impairment, upper-limb impairment, and lower-limb impairment, and each includes various classifications. Cheseto\u2019s classification is T62, for double-leg, below-the-knee amputees.\n\u201cMarko is a fantastic athlete,\u201d said BAA communications manager Chris Lotsbom. \u201cIt truly is an honor to have the fastest T62 athlete in the world competing in Boston and supporting the para athletics divisions.\u201d\nThese divisions create a space for para athletes to be recognized for their achievements with awards and prize money. They also create a physical space: the ambulatory para runners will have a separate start time, no longer mixed in with the main crowd. Cheseto runs on prosthetic blades that are curved in the back, which means he can\u2019t stand still on them without rolling backward. He needs to keep stepping back and forth, which can be a problem in a crowded starting area.\nThe Paralympic Games do not include a marathon for ambulatory lower-limb amputees. So, for Cheseto and other amputees like him, this Boston Marathon is the highest-profile competition there is. Cheseto said he hopes the amputees running Boston will open the door for a Paralympic marathon. \u201cThere are many out there that would come out if there was that event,\u201d he says.\nThe future looks secure for Cheseto. As well as his job with prosthetics, he is sponsored by \u00d6ssur and Nike. He says that their help, and the ongoing support he gets from POA and his wife, Amanda, and the rest of his family have allowed him to reach this point.\nIn the process of sharing his story, Cheseto has become an advocate for mental health. \u201cI have struggles every day about what I went through and losing my feet. But then, at the same time, I\u2019m asking myself: How have I been able to will myself this far, still having a positive attitude toward life? \u2013 most days, anyway,\u201d he says. The answer was being able to \u201ctransition from your old self to your new self,\u201d which many people struggle to do, he says.\nCheseto decided he could shine a light on others who have gone through challenges, so he has been interviewing people and sharing their stories through his YouTube channel. \u201cI felt like I needed more angles to tell the same story of: You know what? Falling down is OK. But the most important part is how many times you get up,\u201d he says.\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "content": "The striker looked like he could be the future of soccer in America. But fans never got to discover how far he could go\nDuring a locker room celebration after a World Cup qualifying win over Canada on 20 October 1976, Miro Rys could not have been more elated. The 19-year-old striker not only scored the opener of the US\u2019s 2-0 triumph but also his first international goal.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the ball right here,\u201d Rys proudly told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m going to take it home and hang it on the wall. I predicted before the game I would score, but when I scored, I felt incredible.\u201d\nRys never had an opportunity to score his second international goal. He was dead less than a year later. Last month marked the 44th anniversary of Rys\u2019 passing.\nWe\u2019ll never know what Rys could have accomplished for club (Chicago Sting and Los Angeles Aztecs) and country. He was the first American teenager to score goals in the North American Soccer League.\n\u201cHe was a special talent,\u201d his USMNT teammate, defender Jim Pollihan said. \u201cHe would have been one of the top American players, probably the top American player in a year or two, had he not passed. Coming out of high school and going right to the pros is obviously a huge step. But to do that and get on the field and score goals, the US at that time didn\u2019t have a whole lot of players that had the ability to score. That was a concern when we were playing qualifying games.\u201d\nThough Rys played only three matches for the US, the team\u2019s manager, Walt Chyzowych, gave the budding star a special tribute, dedicating his 1982 book, The World Cup, to a \u201cyoung player of brilliance cut down tragically in his prime\u201d.\n\u201cIt was absolutely sad,\u201d said Willy Roy, who was the Sting assistant manager at the time. \u201cEverybody was looking for a kid that that\u2019s going to make it. He was not ready to play on the first team.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Pele. He was a good kid, lovable kid under the wrong circumstances. We have to look at things, same as [Christian] Pulisic. All the pressure, all the money, all the stuff that\u2019s going around. They\u2019re very good players in the right situation, but they\u2019re not superstars.\u201d\nOthers felt otherwise.\n\u201cHe was just so athletically talented,\u201d former Sting general manager Jim Walker said. \u201cHad a really good shot. He was left-footed, and he was fast. He was very quick and very aggressive and played a little headier than you would have expected a teenager to do.\u201d\nSting manager Bill Foulkes, a survivor of Manchester United\u2019s 1958 plane crash, told me in May 1976 that he expected Rys to be a regular by the end of the season.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how he can fail as a star,\u201d Foulkes said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many things wrong about him. He has a cannon-like shot and a tremendous desire. He\u2019s very quick and mature for his age.\u201d\nRys\u2019 father, Miroslav, butted heads with Foulkes. \u201cFoulkes was kind of a hard-minded guy and Miro\u2019s father was very strong minded,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey knocked heads a little bit on what Miro\u2019s future should be. We had Miro go to Manchester United and work. Miro\u2019s father wasn\u2019t happy with that.\u201d\nBorn in Czechoslovakia on 18 July 1957, Rys grew up in Kladno, a city of 60,000 about 20 miles outside of Prague. Miroslvav, starred for the Kladno football and ice hockey teams.\nWanting a better life following the 1968 Soviet invasion, the Rys family emigrated to the USA, settling in Cicero, Illinois. Miroslav played for Sparta of the Chicago National Soccer League. Father and son eventually played together on amateur teams.\nRys led Morton East High School to three league titles and runner-up in the Illinois state championship. In one season he scored 27 goals, finishing his career with 58 while earning All-America honors. He skipped college in favor of a professional career, though the Sting tried to convince him otherwise.\n\u201cWe told him, \u2018We\u2019re still going to be here after you get out,\u2019 but he wanted to play,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI told his father, \u201cHere\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. Your son won\u2019t be able to play in college in the later years or for the Olympic team.\u2019 They understood.\u201d\nRys, then 18, had much on his plate. He attended school before training with the Sting later in the day. He earned $170 a week in 1976 (the equivalent of around $820 today). It was perfect timing because his father was laid off as a mechanic by Western Electric several weeks prior.\n\u201cI\u2019m not in it for the money,\u201d Rys said. \u201cI still play soccer for pleasure. Since the time I started kicking when I first walked, I always wanted to be a soccer star.\u201d\nRys realized he had responsibilities.\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m supporting my family a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a big spender, so most of my money goes to the family. We\u2019re getting unemployment compensation, but that\u2019s not enough. My parents don\u2019t mind me supporting them. They\u2019ve been supporting me for 18 years and now I guess it\u2019s my turn.\u201d\nHe hardly lacked in self-confidence. \u201cI\u2019m an all-around player,\u201d Rys said. \u201cI can do everything well. I don\u2019t have any glaring weaknesses. I think I can score because when I get in front of the net, I don\u2019t miss.\u201d\nAgainst the New York Cosmos, Rys covered Pele on a corner kick. \u201cThings were running through my head,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt kind of funny standing next to him. I didn\u2019t freeze. My pride is there. I didn\u2019t want him to score on me. He didn\u2019t.\u201d\nIn the season opener against defending champion Tampa Bay Rowdies, Rys turned heads when he scored as a substitute for Chicago in a 2-1 loss. He finished the season with four goals and two assists in 17 matches.\nWith the USMNT desperately needing a true goalscorer to help end a World Cup drought dating back to 1950, Rys was called up.\nHe scored in two unofficial friendlies \u2013 in a 2-2 draw against a local professional all-star team in Peru and in a 2-0 victory over the Central California League all-stars in Sacramento.\nChyzowych started the teenager in the qualifier and got immediate results. Fifty-four minutes into his debut, Rys scored before 17,675 at the Kingdome. Rys played two more games with the USMNT in scoreless draws against Haiti.\nWhen he didn\u2019t get enough playing time with Chicago in 1977, Rys asked to be traded. He got his wish, in an unusual three-way trade that spanned two leagues. The Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League dealt center-back Steve Ralbovsky to Chicago, which sent Rys to the Aztecs. The Aztecs dispatched defender Miguel Lopez to the Skyhawks.\nOn a team that boasted George Best and Trinidad & Tobago international Steven David, Rys didn\u2019t see much action until the latter was injured. He scored twice in four regular-season appearances, once in the playoffs.\nWanting greater challenges, Rys declined an invitation to play with the US on a Central American tour and ventured to West Germany.\nRys was sent a stand-by ticket by a club, but the flight was full. Rys was told to return to O\u2019Hare Airport the next day. On the drive home, Miroslav told his son, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: \u201cI don\u2019t like it. They send you a cheap ticket, a cheap flight. They\u2019re not going to make everything good for you. Don\u2019t go to Germany. Stay here. In December, you\u2019ll be a free agent.\u201d\nRys left the next day and eventually tried out with Hertha Berlin.\nOn 12 September 1977, Rys was a passenger in a car that was involved in a two-vehicle accident outside Dortmund. Both drivers and Miro were killed. Rys was buried with a soccer ball and shoes. \u201cI\u2019ll give that to him, the two things he loved,\u201d his father told the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIt was not known whether it was the same ball Rys scored with against Canada. It would have been quite fitting for US football\u2019s first teen star.",

He was promoted into the cabinet from vaccines minister in last month\u2019s reshuffle, replacing Gavin Williamson.\n\u201cThe good news is that \u2013 and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children \u2013 99% of schools are open,\u201d he said on Thursday.\n\u201cAttendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, that obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open.\u201d\nThe plan for schools in case Covid infections and serious illnesses soar \u201ccontains lots of contingencies, including masks\u201d, Zahawi confirmed \u2013 though he stressed ministers hoped to avoid reintroducing mandatory measures.\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to return to bubbles because, actually, you saw the fall-off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children.\u201d\nZahawi\u2019s comments came as the UK recorded 39,851 new cases of Covid on Wednesday, up by 5,982 compared with Tuesday.\nSchoolchildren\u2019s learning and wellbeing have been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, as they were forced to abandon in-person teaching during two national lockdowns in England, with most taught at home by struggling parents trying to balance work and home-schooling.\nMinisters came in for criticism after the resignation of the government\u2019s education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, over their failure to come up with sufficient funding for his ambitious proposals to help children who have lost months of learning through Covid disruption.\nZahawi said he wanted pupils to catch up with missed schooling as quickly as possible, and told ITV that for those at primary school it was \u201clooking really positive\u201d, but voiced concerns about \u201cthe children who have the least time to recover, so the 16 to 19-year-olds and secondary school children\u201d.\nHe also conceded the rollout of CO2 monitors to schools to monitor ventilation in classrooms had been slower than hoped \u2013 but blamed supply issues and said the 300,000 devices promised in August would be delivered by the end of November.\nAnd Zahawi defended criticism that the sole policy announced by Boris Johnson in his Tory conference speech on Wednesday was recycled from 2019. The prime minister said he was \u201cannouncing a levelling-up premium of up to \u00a33,000 to send the best maths and science teachers to the places that need them most\u201d. But while billed as new, the policy was launched in 2019 but then phased out.\nZahawi said it was a different version of the old policy, explaining: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem saying, look, I\u2019ll bring something back and improve it.\u201d",

We\u2019re testing prompts on Android and iOS that give you a heads up if the convo you\u2019re about to enter could get heated or intense.This is a work in progress as we learn how to better support healthy conversation. pic.twitter.com/x6Nsn3HPu1\nThe trial is being conducted with a small group of users, on English-language settings, on Apple\u2019s iOS platform.\nIn testimony to US senators this week, the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen referred to Twitter\u2019s attempts to take the heat out of some interactions as an example that her former employer could follow. Haugen, who said Facebook was too focused on making its platform \u201ctwitchy\u201d and \u201cviral\u201d, said Twitter had reduced angry interactions by introducing a feature that asked users whether they wanted to tweet a link they had not tapped on.\nThe \u201cintense\u201d conversation test is Twitter\u2019s latest attempt to limit abuse on its platform, an issue that came into renewed focus in the UK this year after England football players were racially abused by Twitter users during the Euro 2020 tournament.\nOther initiatives being tested by the US company include: a feature that allows users to remove unwanted followers without officially blocking them; and a \u201csafety mode\u201d that blocks accounts for seven days if the tech firm\u2019s systems spot them using harmful language or sending repetitive, uninvited replies and mentions. The safety mode feature is being trialled initially among a small group of users, with a particular emphasis on female journalists and members of marginalised communities.\nTwitter is also considering giving users the ability to archive old tweets and remove them from public view after a set period of time, such as 30, 60 or 90 days.\nOnline abuse is coming into sharp legislative focus in the UK with the draft online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on social media companies to protect users from harmful content. Social media firms are required under the draft bill to submit to Ofcom, the communications watchdog, a \u201crisk assessment\u201d of content that causes harm. A joint committee of MPs and peers is scrutinising the bill and is due to report at the end of the year.",

        "content": "City\u2019s leader announces initiative as thousands still await trial, and also reveals project for new metropolis\nHong Kong will build a new megacourt to address a shortage of space as it works through a backlog of the thousands arrested during the 2019 mass protests, and the more than 150 arrested under the national security law.\nThe city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, announced the initiative on Wednesday in a policy address, which also included plans for a new metropolis on the border with mainland China and further tightening of national security laws.\nLam said the megacourt would be established in an existing government building \u201cto handle cases involving a large number of defendants\u201d until a planned new district court is commissioned in late 2027. She said work on the court, as well as supporting facilities, would begin early next year.\n\u201cI have asked relevant departments to fully assist the judiciary in tackling the problem of courtroom shortage,\u201d she said.\nDuring demonstrations in 2019 when millions took to Hong Kong\u2019s streets, police arrested more than 10,200 individuals. There was a 70% increase in the number of 16- to 20-year-olds arrested compared with the previous year, according to police statistics.\nBy April this year, when government figures were published, about one-quarter of the 10,200 had begun or completed judicial proceedings. Among those being processed, 720 people had been charged with rioting offences, while others were accused of unlawful assembly, desecration of the flag, weapon possession, stopping vehicles on an expressway, or assaulting a police officer, the South China Morning Post reported at the time.\nThere have also been single cases with large numbers of defendants. In March a bail hearing for 47 defendants \u2013 the bulk of those arrested over the staging of unofficial primaries for the pro-democracy camp \u2013 was criticised as lacking judicial fairness.\nThe first day of the hearing ran until 3am the following morning, ending with at least four defendants taken away by ambulance amid claims of a lack of food, rest, or opportunity to change clothes between sessions. The individuals and various legal teams struggled to fit in the courtroom.\nThat case has since been delayed multiple times, with most defendants \u2013 including former politicians and activists \u2013 remaining in jail on remand.\nThere have been growing concerns about the independence of Hong Kong\u2019s once-vaunted court system, as it seeks to navigate increasing government pressure and the 2020 introduction of the national security law that included a separate police department, and provisions for the chief executive to handpick judges for sensitive cases. Trials can also be transferred to the mainland in special instances, but this power has not yet been used.\nIn her speech, Lam defended the judicial system, saying a fair trial and due process were \u201cessential elements of the rule of law\u201d, and that the judiciary played a \u201cpivotal role\u201d.\nThe lengthy policy address also flagged plans for a new city in the northern and rural areas near the border with mainland China. Lam said the metropolis could house up to 2.5 million people eventually, and serve as an international IT hub.\nShe also outlined plans to continue tightening security in Hong Kong, including implementing national security legislation in addition to the already active Beijing-imposed law, bringing in a \u201cfake news\u201d law, increasing national security education in schools, introducing programmes to help young people \u201cdevelop positive thinking and law\u2011abiding awareness\u201d, and expanding mandatory oath-taking for public servants.\nOn Thursday, Lam also said Hong Kong needed to consider banning insults, with a law covering the police, officials and potentially the general public, the broadcaster RTHK reported.\n\u201cIn Singapore, they\u2019ve recently enacted a piece of legislation to protect security guards in the private sector, so they won\u2019t be insulted or injured,\u201d Lam told the legislature. \u201cSo, give us some time to consider the scope of the legislation.\u201d",

Reduced rainfall, rising temperatures, the mismanagement of public land and poor agricultural practices have caused water levels, even in the Middle East\u2019s second largest lake, Lake Van, to recede by as much as 200 metres.\nMigratory birds have been particularly affected by the change \u2013 between 3,000 and 5,000 young flamingos died of starvation in July after the waters of Lake Tuz, in central Anatolia\u2019s Konya basin, receded too far for them to reach the shore from their nests. The impact on ecosystems has also caused mass gull deaths and birds of prey are falling sick from infections caused by changes to their diet.\nAgit, who works at Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l University\u2019s Wild Animal Protection and Rehabilitation Centre in the city of Van, said this year\u2019s fish migration lasted two and a half months \u2013 half its usual length \u2013 because of the lack of rain. As a result, gulls and other birds have turned to eating unnatural foods such as rubbish and dead animals, which can ultimately kill them due to parasites.\n\u201cBirds don\u2019t have enough food, so some are attacking each other,\u201d says Agit. \u201cHawks and eagles don\u2019t usually eat crows, but now they do and sometimes they carry diseases of ticks, which might be lethal.\u201d\nHe is preparing to release the long-legged buzzard, whose wing was wounded in a fight with other birds over food \u2013 it couldn\u2019t hunt and was starving before being brought to Agit at the rehabilitation centre.\nNow fit and healthy, Agit holds the bird in the air before letting go. It soars off towards the last patch of lake, flying over dry ground strewn with bird bones. \u201cTwo years ago, this mud was not here and it was all wet,\u201d says Agit.\nProf Lo\u011fman Aslan, director of the centre, says that stress was also a factor in the bird deaths. The drop in food sources and changes to the natural environment were stressing the animals and making them more susceptible to parasites. Other experts have blamed emissions from coal power plants as a contributing factor \u2013 Turkey is among the main contributors to Europe\u2019s air pollution levels.\nAccording to the UN, Turkey is highly vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. This year, the Sea of Marmara has experienced an explosion of \u201csea snot\u201d, or phytoplankton, caused by rising temperatures, and the largest forest fires in living memory ravaged the country\u2019s south coast. In July, the eastern city of Cizre recorded the country\u2019s highest ever temperature at 49.1C.\nMany think of Turkey as Europe\u2019s rubbish dump, as plastic waste is exported there for recycling, but much of it ends up illegally dumped, burned or left to pollute the seas.\nAnother lake in eastern Turkey, Lake Akgol, completely dried up this year. Shepherds in the area said that, although drought has been a problem in the region for the past 10 years, this year has been the worst, as there was little snow in the winter due to warmer temperatures, and therefore little meltwater.\n\u201cIt used to be very beautiful here and everywhere was grass. Now it doesn\u2019t grow,\u201d says Yakub, 20, a farmer from a village close to Akgol, which is now a greenish patch of parched earth.\n\u201cIt just happened this year and it was really fast. We used to swim here at this time of year. There were a lot of ducks and pelicans, but now there\u2019s almost nothing.\u201d\nAside from drought and rising temperatures, one of the biggest challenges facing Turkey\u2019s water supplies is that, with the ground so dry, farmers are rerouting water sources for their land and animals. Groundwater supplies are becoming depleted as a result, and little is being done to address the issue.\nPoor agricultural practices, along with the use of lake water for large construction projects, and pollution, mean that wetlands are drying out \u2013 and they are a key habitat for migratory birds that come to Turkey from central and north Africa each spring to breed.\nAccording to Turkey\u2019s Do\u011fa Derne\u011fi, a group of conservation volunteers, almost half of Turkey\u2019s wetlands have been irreversibly lost over the past 70 years. It says that currently there are water management plans in place for only 24 of the 76 registered wetlands.\nSafak Arslan, a bird of prey specialist with the group, says poor practices and a lack of government policy are destroying the land, and that needs to change. According to Arslan, only a return to traditional Anatolian farming methods, using irrigation terraces and planting indigenous crops such as oregano and lavender, which require little water, can help save the landscape, and therefore the birds.\n\u201cExperts are telling us that there will be more unseasonable rains and droughts, yet we haven\u2019t taken any precautions against them so far,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are a water-poor country. We need to take action before the fire breaks out, before the forests disappear and before the wetlands dry up.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "content": "The Afterlight is a collage of fragments with a single 35mm print \u2013 but it has more in common with digital media than the illusion of instant access suggests\nFor as long as there have been films, there have been lost films. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of them \u2013 and not just unloved obscurities but key works by Hitchcock, Ozu and Warhol, all left to decay in their canisters, burned up in archive fires, or simply misplaced and never recovered. One day my new film, The Afterlight, will be among them.\nAssembled from fragments of hundreds of old films from around the world, The Afterlight is a found-footage collage that brings together a vast ensemble cast of actors with one thing in common: everyone who appears on screen is no longer alive. In the film, they live on through the performances they left behind, as though preserved in the amber of cultural memory.\nLike cultural memory, however, The Afterlight is continually fading. The film exists as a single 35mm print, with no digital copies whatsoever: no DVD, no Blu-ray, no streaming. Every time it screens, that lone print will further erode: a living record of its own life in circulation. Eventually it will deteriorate to nothing.\nThat prospect was easier to stomach when the film existed only in my imagination, before it was a tangible object representing countless creative obstacles, breakthroughs and discoveries. Its future non-existence is especially daunting after two years filled with so many other losses, during which on-demand home viewing became a rare source of comfort and stability.\nEven 15 years ago, when my own passion for cinema was cultivated by a LoveFilm subscription and the imports section of play.com, I was accustomed to waiting a few days for a film to arrive in the post. Today, the barriers to home viewing \u2013 browsing and buffering \u2013 are measured in seconds. One might expect a commensurate expansion in the scale and scope of contemporary cinephilia.\nInstead, it often seems as though the evident potential of streaming to open up new audiences, and diversify cultural palates, has become an excuse to forgo the work that might usher in a more complex, curious film culture. After all, Mati Diop\u2019s acclaimed Cannes prize winner Atlantics is technically available to every one of Netflix\u2019s 200 million global subscribers, so don\u2019t complain if every time you load up the app, you see Hubie Halloween.\nIn a sense, this is nothing new: even film archives \u2013 whose existence is predicated on the value of making the moving image available to current and future generations \u2013 are filled with prints that will never be screened, films that will never be seen. Jurij Meden, a curator at the Austrian Film Museum, calls such holdings \u201cliving-dead surplus\u201d and estimates that they account for 90% of archive collections.\nSuch films are at least well preserved, lest they one day cross over into that lucky 10% that commands public attention. Not so in the wilds of streaming. Any film \u201cbought\u201d on Amazon Prime is yours to view for only as long as Amazon retains the permission of the copyright holder to show it to you. And if those same copyright holders could not be trusted to protect our cultural heritage back when films were physical things that could be organised and inventoried, they seem unlikely to prove more reliable in the digital era.\nA physical film print, properly stored, can last for hundreds of years. Digital media, for all its flexibility, is vastly less stable, requiring constant migration to evade data degradation and format obsolescence. One infamous cautionary tale concerns Pixar\u2019s efforts to release Toy Story on DVD for the first time in 2000. Though just five years had elapsed since the film\u2019s cinema release, the original animation files had become so thoroughly corrupted that animators were forced to recreate as much as a fifth of the film from reference copies. It\u2019s safe to assume films that didn\u2019t spawn multi-billion dollar franchises have not fared better.\nA new age of lost films may just be beginning. Only now, we won\u2019t even see them go, cocooned in an illusion of instant and perpetual access. Today, a film might look just as good the last time it screens as the first \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be a last time. For all the obvious limitations placed on the lifespan of my film, it might have more in common with the cohort of 2021 releases than first impressions suggest.\nIn the case of The Afterlight, at least, the fragile equation at the heart of film culture is laid bare. The scratches and blemishes that accumulate on the print will irrevocably alter the film itself, but they\u2019ll also stand in for something larger: the projection during which they occurred, and the audience there to witness it. In the process, the act of viewership itself will be made material, in an era when it\u2019s usually anything but.\nThe Afterlight will screen at London film festival on 15 and 17 October, before screenings at the Cambridge, Leeds and Cinecity Brighton film festivals next month.

        "content": "Forty-four years after The Duellists, Ridley Scott draws swords again with his star-studded swashbuckler The Last Duel. But which one-on-one fight film is the champion? Let mortal combat begin \u2026\nInspired by Ridley Scott\u2019s The Duellists, Gregory Widen wrote a screenplay about immortals trying to hack each other\u2019s heads off with big swords. Former Olympic fencer Bob Anderson choreographed the showdown between Christopher Lambert and evil Clancy Brown, who is clearly having too much fun to live. \u201cThere can be only one!\u201d Followed by a zillion sequels and TV spin-offs.\nSo unending is the carnage in the six-film Baby Cart series that it\u2019s hard to single out just one sword fight, but let\u2019s go with the 50th kill from the first film, when wandering ronin Itt\u014d (Tomisabur\u014d Wakayama), infant son strapped to his back, takes a leaf out of Archimedes\u2019 book by using reflecting sunlight to blind his opponent.\nAll the fights in Zhang Yimou\u2019s wuxia film, with its unreliable narrator and politically ambiguous subtext, are exquisite exercises in colour-coded gorgeousness. But with its swirling autumn leaves, Maggie Cheung serenely facing off against headstrong Zhang Ziyi is probably the prettiest duel of them all, albeit not very useful for anyone looking for practical sword fighting tips.\nThe exhibition match at the start of Philippe de Broca\u2019s swashbuckler (adapted from Paul F\u00e9val\u2019s much-filmed novel) showcases the irresistible swagger of Vincent Perez\u2019s Duc as he demonstrates his secret sword thrust (we might as well call it Chekhov\u2019s sword thrust) on the protagonist (Daniel Auteuil). Floppy shirts and age-inappropriate romance galore!\nScott\u2019s debut, an adaptation of a Joseph Conrad short story, arguably kickstarted a mini-trend for men wearing their hair in plaits, as seen later on Adam Ant. The second duel is notable for Keith Carradine turning aside to sneeze, and Harvey Keitel exclaiming \u201cL\u00e0!\u201d The sword fights were staged by William Hobbs, of whom more later.\nFor many non-Asian film fans, Ang Lee\u2019s romantic fable was their first taste of the Chinese martial fantasy world of wuxia. Taking his cue from the King Hu classic A Touch of Zen (1971), Lee set one of his gravity-defying duels high among the branches of a bamboo forest, where Chow Yun-fat tries to teach Zhang Ziyi a lesson.\nThe bittersweet romance between the older but no wiser Robin (Sean Connery) and Marian (Audrey Hepburn) is almost eclipsed by the frenemy bromance between Robin and his nemesis \u2013 Robert Shaw as cinema\u2019s most sympatico Sheriff of Nottingham. Which means, of course, they have to cross swords, with choreographer Hobbs showing how exhausting fighting can be for oldsters.\nOn a corpse-littered bridge, differently abled David Chiang devises a cunning way of wielding multiple weapons with just one hand to defeat the evil teacher who killed his best buddy. Directed by Chang Cheh, master of heroic bromance, but choreographed by Lau Kar-leung, who would go on to become one of Shaw Brothers\u2019 finest action directors.\nHollywood swashbuckling at its most flamboyant, with Stewart Granger performing most of his own stunts in stripey commedia dell\u2019arte trousers as he and Mel Ferrer parry and riposte all over a packed theatre, making full use of balustrades and seatbacks in a thrilling duel staged by fencing master Fred Cavens.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of swordplay in Japan\u2019s longest-running film series (1962-89), but for convenience\u2019s sake let\u2019s go with Takeshi Kitano\u2019s lively remake/homage, in which the writer-director takes the blind swordsman role. He and a ronin (Tadanobu Asano) rehearse moves in their heads (pre-Guy Ritchie\u2019s Sherlock Holmes) before Zatoichi confounds the opposition by changing his grip.\n\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d Mandy Patinkin gets one of cinema\u2019s most satisfying revenges in his showdown with \u201cthe six-fingered man\u201d, an unrecognisable Christopher Guest, in a fight choreographed by Anderson.\nThe most memorable duels in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s adaptation of Thackeray\u2019s tale of a bounder are probably the ones with pistols, but the glorious natural lighting, Steven Berkoff\u2019s perfect twirl and Ryan O\u2019Neal\u2019s foil-deflection and grab, coached and choreographed by Anderson, make this one a keeper.\n\u201cHow senseless,\u201d says Kanbei, leader of the samurai, as he watches this duel. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious what will happen.\u201d But maybe not so obvious to the greenhorn, or to first-time viewers of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s masterpiece. The aggressor is full of sound and fury, but he is no match for the badass master swordsman (Seiji Miyaguchi) who fells him with one perfect stroke.\nBasil Rathbone, the finest fencer in Hollywood, was invariably cast as villains, so always had to lose. But he said Tyrone Power was \u201cthe most agile man with a sword I\u2019ve ever faced before a camera. Tyrone could have fenced Errol Flynn into a cocked hat.\u201d Their superb duel here was staged by Cavens.\nTakashi Miike\u2019s 2011 remake has its moments, but nothing to equal the impact of the graveyard duel in Masaki Kobayashi\u2019s original masterpiece, a scathing critique of institutional hypocrisy. Black and white widescreen plus Dutch tilts (a crafty way of getting an entire katana sword into frame) plus the great Tatsuya Nakadai at his frowniest add up to a classic showdown.\nAnother Hobbs \u2013 choreographer extraordinaire \u2013 special. The final duel between a hero (Michael York) mad with grief-stricken fury after the murder of his mistress, and his scheming nemesis, played by Christopher Lee, follows the fight into a church (cue shocked nuns) and shows the physical exertion progressively taking its toll on the combatants.\nKing Hu, in the Shaw Brothers film that put him on the map, revolutionised wuxia by filming his combat scenes like dance, with a leading lady (Pei-Pei Cheng, later Crouching Tiger\u2019s villain) who had trained in ballet. In the temple duel she holds her own even when the villain cheats by trying to wear her down with his expendable minions.\nFresh off his work on Captain Blood (1935), Cavens was hired to add pep to the fight scenes in Michael Curtiz\u2019s classic swashbuckler, and you don\u2019t get much peppier than Errol Flynn versus Rathbone in fabulous three-strip Technicolor. More parrying and lunging than might have been found in authentic medieval swordplay, perhaps, but one of the all-time great cinema duels.\nIn another of Kurosawa\u2019s minimalist but thrilling duels, Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai stare at each other for what seems like hours before matters are settled with a single rotating draw that sword fight fans never tire of analysing. The blood was a pressurised mixture of chocolate syrup and carbonated water; the hidden mechanism reportedly malfunctioned, with geyser-like results.\nExhibit No 1 in demonstrating Hobbs\u2019s ability to ground his fight choreography in character is this brilliant showdown in which the combatants\u2019 personalities are reflected in their duelling techniques. Aristocratic Cunningham (Tim Roth) is skilled with the rapier, but sadistic and overconfident, whereas honest Rob (Liam Neeson) is all blundering around with a broadsword. Guess who wins?",

        "content": "Gavin Newsom\u2019s survival as California\u2019s governor was just one of hundreds of recall attempts on the west coast this year\nRecall attempts across the US in recent months have hit a fever pitch in response to Covid-19 and racial justice disputes, and a socialist city council member in Seattle has become the latest prominent seat to be targeted.\nOpponents of Kshama Sawant have spent months collecting thousands of signatures in an attempt to unseat the council member, who became the first socialist on the Seattle council in nearly a century after she beat a Democrat in 2013. Last week, the recall effort officially qualified for an election in December.\nThe attempt to oust Sawant during her third term was based on claims that she opened city hall to demonstrators during a protest, disregarding Covid-19 restrictions, used city resources for a \u201cTax Amazon\u201d effort and led a march to Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan\u2019s home despite the address being protected under state confidentiality laws.\nAcross the US, there have been at least 500 recall attempts this year, with the majority in the west, according to Joshua Spivak, a senior fellow at the Hugh L Carey Institute at Wagner College, and the author of Recall Elections: From Alexander Hamilton to Gavin Newsom. Although many have not qualified for the ballot, he said the number of attempts is already one of the highest in more than a decade.\n\u201cIt appears that the restrictions around the pandemic have fueled a boost in recall attempts,\u201d he said. \u201cTo a significantly lower degree issues surrounding the Black Lives Matter protests and other social justice related matters, such as the teaching of critical race theory, have led to recalls that we normally don\u2019t see \u2013 more of a national level issue as opposed to a strictly local level policy debate.\u201d\nJust last month, California governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, defeated a recall bid that was spurred in part by safety measures in response to Covid, to remain in office. In Washington state, Durkan also faced a recall effort, after she was accused of mishandling protests, but last fall the state supreme court nixed the effort.\nSpivak said: \u201cThey see the Gavin Newsom recall, and they also maybe remember the Scott Walker recall, and feel this is a good weapon. Part of the problem, of course, is that the Scott Walker and Gavin Newsom recall \u2026 neither of them worked in the end. And arguably both of the governors were strengthened by the recall effort.\u201d\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 19 states and Washington DC allow the recall of state officials, while at least 30 states allow the practice in local jurisdictions.\nThe push to oust Sawant was launched last summer by a Seattle resident, less than a year after she beat out an opponent with unprecedented financial support from Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle.\nIn April, Washington\u2019s supreme court allowed the effort to move forward, stating that three of the recall petition\u2019s charges against Sawant \u201care factually and legally sufficient to support recall\u201d.\nKing county elections announced it had accepted more than 11,000 signatures collected through the recall process, and it would be on the ballot during an election on 7 December. The effort needed about 10,700 signatures to move forward.\nSawant\u2019s supporters have framed this as her latest fight against big business, the right wing and the political establishment as a whole. They have also argued that the timing of the election is akin to voter suppression, saying her opponents coordinated their effort so it would be during an election that they anticipate will have a lower turnout rate.\nIn response to the charges, Bryan Koulouris, the Kshama Solidarity Campaign spokesperson, said that the crowd was masked in the after-hours visit to city hall, Sawant didn\u2019t lead the protest to the mayor\u2019s house and doesn\u2019t know her address. He also said that the \u201cTax Amazon\u201d claim is misleading and that Sawant \u201cwas doing exactly what she was elected to do, which was use her council office to build the type of movements that are necessary for working people\u201d.\nSawant told the Guardian she is not surprised her seat on the city council is being threatened.\n\u201cI think the fact that it is happening now obviously has a lot to do with our Marxist approach and the way we have used our position so effectively, absolutely refusing to be marginalized and at the same time absolutely refusing to sell out \u2026 In that context we should expect attacks like this,\u201d she said.\nHenry Bridger II, campaign manager and chairman of Recall Sawant, said that he is not a billionaire and is in fact a Democrat. He also said the timing of the election came down to how long it took to collect the signatures and validate them.\nBridger said he was happy to see that the recall was moving forward, as it already shows just how many people in her district are not supportive of the council member.\n\u201cShe thinks she\u2019s above the law, and she is not,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that we\u2019re really excited that the citizens \u2013 she gets to face her constituents now. And they get to decide if she broke the law or not. And with all of these signatures, it shows that there\u2019s a huge support to remove her from office and hold her accountable.\u201d\nThe Seattle Times reported this may be the first time a push to recall a member of the city council has reached voters.\nThe recall proponents have raised over $637,000, while the Kshama Solidarity Campaign has raised over $687,000, according to the Seattle ethics and elections commission.\nThe yes or no recall question is expected to be the only one on the ballot in December, according to King county elections. If Sawant is ousted, voters will not choose a replacement candidate, the seat will instead be filled through an appointment process.\nDuring Sawant\u2019s time in office she has helped lead the push to boost Seattle\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour \u2013 a first for a major US city \u2013 and helped to secure more rights for renters.",

The firm was described as being the centre of a multimillion-pound money laundering business, according to crown court proceedings that followed.\nThe FCA prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC told Westminster court that when Fowler Oldfield was taken on as a client by NatWest its predicted turnover was said to be \u00a315m a year. However, it deposited \u00a3365m in just under five years.\nShe said: \u201cThe turnover of Fowler Oldfield was predicted to be \u00a315m per annum. It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited \u00a3365m, with around \u00a3264m in cash.\u201d\nShe said at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to \u00a31.8m a day.\nNatWest admitted three offences under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. The criminal action, announced by the FCA in March, is the first against a bank under the legislation.\nNatWest will be sentenced at Southwark crown court on or before 8 December.\nThe FCA said it would not take action against any current or former employees.\nThe bank said it was not anticipating any other authority investigating this conduct.\nNatWest\u2019s chief executive, Alison Rose, said: \u201cWe deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016.\n\u201cNatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties. In the years since this case, we have invested significant resources and continue to enhance our efforts to effectively combat financial crime.\n\u201cWe work tirelessly with colleagues, other banks, industry bodies, law enforcement, regulators and governments to help find collaborative solutions to this shared challenge. These partnerships are crucial to counter the significant and evolving threat of financial crime to society.\u201d",

        "content": "Declaration, part of the Business Leaders Against the Death Penalty campaign, first launched in March by Sir Richard Branson\nMore than 150 global business leaders have signed a declaration calling for the end of the death penalty around the world and criticizing capital punishment for perpetuating inequality.\nThe declaration, part of the Business Leaders Against the Death Penalty campaign, was first launched in March at the virtual South by Southwest festival by Sir Richard Branson, one of the campaign\u2019s founders. Initial signatories included the billionaire fashion mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Arianna Huffington, and the leaders of Unilever and Bayer.\nAhead of World Day Against the Death Penalty on 10 October, the campaign announced on Thursday that over 100 additional signatories have signed the declaration. Among the new signatories are Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, and Sally Jewell, former US secretary of the interior and former chief executive of recreational goods company REI.\n\u201cAs an irreversible and extreme form of punishment, the death penalty is inhumane, and it is irreconcilable with human dignity. Its worldwide abolition is a moral imperative that all of humanity should support,\u201d reads the declaration.\nMore than 170 UN member states have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. In the US, 23 states have outlawed the death penalty and four have moratoriums on executions. Over a dozen have not used the death penalty in years.\nWhile executions have become rare in the United States, a handful still happen every year. Seventeen people were executed in 2020, including 10 people who were executed on federal charges. This year has seen seven executions to date, including the execution of Ernest Johnson in Missouri on 5 October despite pleas for clemency, including from Pope Francis.\nCelia Ouellette, the chief executive of the Responsible Business Initiative for Justice, a nonprofit who helped coordinate the campaign, said she hopes the new batch of signatories will give momentum to campaigns to end the death penalty in the US.\n\u201cThe controversiality of the death penalty has been massively reduced,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cThe death penalty used to be this very politically touchy subject that people would run away from as fast as they could.\u201d\nActivists against the death penalty have been focusing on pressuring Joe Biden to follow up on his campaign promise of passing legislation that would end the death penalty at the federal level. While Biden\u2019s justice department reinstated the moratorium on all federal executions, which the Trump administration had previously lifted to carry out a wave of controversial executions, the president has so far not taken further action to address the death penalty.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve yet to see any kind of meaningful and enduring action come out of his administration,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cNot executing people now doesn\u2019t mean that the next president will not execute people.\u201d\nWhile there has been little legislation on the federal level, state governments have been for years slowly outlawing the death penalty, particularly as ending capital punishment has become an increasingly bipartisan issue. Most recently, Virginia became the first southern state to ban the death penalty in February. Similar legislation is currently going through the state legislatures in Utah and Ohio.\n\u201cI have a lot of hope in our state that we\u2019re going to end the death penalty,\u201d said John Rush, a business owner based in Columbus, Ohio, and one of the new signatories to the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that the momentum be kept up by the business community \u2026 to kind of keep pushing the momentum forward.\u201d",

        "content": "Now 73, the star of Hannah and Her Sisters shines in Jason Blum\u2019s new horror. She talks about why audiences are hungry for mature movies, and her unhappiness at becoming an accidental poster girl for cosmetic surgery\nIn 1973, Barbara Hershey \u2013 then known as Barbara Seagull, for reasons we\u2019ll get into shortly \u2013 went on the popular US talkshow The Dick Cavett Show and torpedoed her career. She was on alongside her then partner, the actor David Carradine, but when Hershey/Seagull walked out on stage, she could hear their eight-month-old baby crying off-camera. So she ran off and returned with the little boy, named Free. Unfortunately, Free continued to fret. So Hershey/Seagull breastfed her baby live on air. Cavett was stunned and so, clearly, were the producers, who cut to commercials.\n\u201cDid you breastfeed the baby earlier or was that my imagination?\u201d Cavett asked when they returned, Free now fed. \u201cI did it,\u201d Hershey, then 25, replied, entirely unabashed.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it several times in my life. I think I\u2019ve learned now to be cool about it, but it does bother me a bit. Does it bother you?\u201d he asks Carradine, who shrugs noncommittally. \u201cWell, we presented the censor with a unique problem that will keep him up for days,\u201d Cavett concludes.\nAnd not just the censor. After the show was aired, Hershey was widely criticised for breastfeeding on TV, and this was seen as final proof of her unreliable hippy wackiness, even more so than her decision to change her name to Seagull after a seagull was killed during the making of a film. Cavett was clearly far less weirded out by that revelation than he was by breastfeeding.\nWatching this clip now, I tell Hershey, I couldn\u2019t help but delight in how gloriously badass she was. \u201cOh that makes me feel good!\u201d she hoots. \u201cI wish that I could say I [breastfed on TV] for some political or badass reason, but I was an innocent. I knew what my son needed, so I just gave it to him.\u201d\nHershey has been acting since the mid 1960s, but her career was undeniably hampered by the public and media scepticism of her in the 70s, and the assumption that she was merely Carradine\u2019s dippy girlfriend. It wasn\u2019t until the 80s, after she had broken up with Carradine (and dropped Seagull) that things really took off for her. Does she resent the sexism of the 70s, when she was frequently dismissed as some flaky airhead?\n\u201cI\u2019m not resentful at all, because the reactions were honest and my reactions were honest. But when you\u2019ve been acting for 50 years, you do a lot of growing up publicly, and a lot of that is misinterpreted, so that\u2019s difficult. I think I was going through what a lot of young people were going through in that period. I just happened to do it in public,\u201d she says.\nHershey, 73, is in Los Angeles, talking to me by video chat, and even at this distance you can still see the same grace and self-possession that she had when facing down Cavett\u2019s disapproval, and when she played the wealthy Hilary Whitney in 1988\u2019s classic Beaches, and as the mysterious Madame Serena in Jane Campion\u2019s 1996 film The Portrait of a Lady, for which Hershey got an Oscar nomination. She has the perfect posture of former dance teacher, which is exactly what she plays in her new film, The Manor, the latest horror movie from Jason Blum\u2019s Welcome to the Blumhouse series for Amazon.\nThe film has a great premise: what if the older people who say people are trying to kill them in their assisted living centre aren\u2019t suffering from dementia but telling the truth? Hershey plays Judith, a spunky grandmother, who is ignored by her daughter and treated like a naughty toddler by the staff of the centre. Even her adored grandson thinks she\u2019s losing her mind when she begs him to get her out before she is murdered. The film clearly wants to do for older people what Get Out did for people of colour, showing how they are ill-treated by wider society and literalising their worst fears, and it does this pretty well in the first half, but goes utterly bananas in the second (Hershey says the ending is \u201cprovocative, and I\u2019m all for it\u201d). I ask if part of the appeal of the film was how it overturns stereotypes about older people.\n\u201cYes. I believe in age but I don\u2019t believe in numbers. I\u2019m 73 \u2013 this is the truth!\u201d she says. I tell her she looks about half that, which is true, but she waves the comment away. But they must have aged her in the movie because she looks about twice as old in it, I say. \u201cUm, I yellowed my teeth, and that was the only ageing we did. I think it was the lighting,\u201d she says.\nHershey may not believe in age but, sadly, others do, and it is she says, \u201cdefinitely\u201d harder for an female actor to find good roles the older she gets. \u201cThere are a few actresses who seem to get all of them and the rest of us are scrabbling. I hope if audiences like this film, it will encourage film-makers to see that we\u2019re not going to repel audiences because we\u2019re older. We can be more interesting because we\u2019re older.\u201d\nSexism and sneering at women was, of course, not just confined to the 70s. Hershey talks about how one of her favourite things about the film is the close relationship between Judith and her grandson, Josh (Nicholas Alexander). \u201cIt\u2019s not a relationship between an older person and a younger person, it\u2019s a relationship between two people who are crazy about each other, and I love that,\u201d she says. It\u2019s hard not to hear in this a reference to the attention she got when in a relationship, first, with the older Carradine in the 70s, and later, with Lost\u2019s Naveen Andrews, 21 years younger than her. They were together from 1999 to 2009. Hershey describes herself as a private person, so I ask how she found the spotlight on her love life. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. I accept it, because what else can you do? But I don\u2019t encourage it,\u201d she says.\nIn one scene in The Manor, some of the residents of the home snicker at an older woman who has had plastic surgery, and Hershey\u2019s character admonishes them gently, saying: \u201cI understand people\u2019s choices.\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to see this as a nod to the criticism Hershey got in the 80s when it was alleged she\u2019d had collagen injected into her lips. Did she want to address that in the movie?\n\u201cWell, what was said about me was really silly. What I did was for a role, and it was a temporary thing. I didn\u2019t do surgery. I wish I hadn\u2019t done it now because I didn\u2019t want to attract attention in that way and I became the poster child of plastic surgery and it wasn\u2019t fair, it wasn\u2019t what I was about or what I had done. Look at my face! I haven\u2019t altered it,\u201d she says.\nI tell her that, given The Manor is about a protagonist who begins to doubt her own sanity, and is a former dancer, I imagined that she was playing the similarly visionary Nina (Natalie Portman) from 2010\u2019s Black Swan, in which Hershey played Portman\u2019s mother, but now as a grandmother.\n\u201cOh my God! Natalie! What an ending for that character! Well, in Black Swan, it\u2019s not clear if Nina dies or not in the last scene. I always chose that she died there,\u201d says Hershey, definitively ending a decade of fan speculation.\nHershey was born and raised in Hollywood, the daughter of a second-generation Jewish immigrant and midwestern Presbyterian. From an early age, she wanted to act and I ask why.\n\u201cThe truth is repression. I had a repressed childhood. I wasn\u2019t allowed to say anything negative, so I would go out in the back yard and act out the wicked witch and there was this release and freedom. I could be anybody and say anything and I was safe and free and happy. Most creative people I know had conflicted childhoods, which I think drives them to need to express something. I don\u2019t think talent\u2019s very rare, I think the need to express something is,\u201d she says.\nHer brief switch to Seagull in the 70s was not the first time she changed her name: her original surname was Herzstein, but her (Jewish) agent told her it sounded \u201ctoo Jewish\u201d, so he changed it to Hershey, \u201cwhich I hated because it made me think of chocolate, and I thought, oh my God, so sweet! I accepted it, but it wasn\u2019t my choice,\u201d she says.\nChanging names runs in the family: when her son Free was six, he asked her what his name meant. \u201cI said to him, \u2018It means you\u2019re free to change your name when you want,\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt had become a symbol of the 70s and I was embarrassed for him every time he introduced himself: \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Free.\u2019 That\u2019s a hard thing to live up to. So we got a book of names and he chose Tom. But when he became an adult, he changed it back to Free,\u201d she says fondly. Free now works as a nurse in Los Angeles.\nHershey worked with some of the best directors around in the 80s, including Martin Scorsese (Last Temptation of Christ), Barry Levinson (The Natural, Tin Men) and Woody Allen, who offered her the role of Lee in his masterpiece, Hannah and Her Sisters, three days after she moved to New York. Hershey is terrific as the fragile sister who falls into an affair with Elliot (Michael Caine), the husband of her sister Hannah (Mia Farrow). I ask Hershey if it struck her later that Allen sort of predicted his own life in that film, given that Farrow\u2019s partner betrays her with a female relative, as Allen would soon do, when he infamously cheated on Farrow with her daughter, Soon-Yi Previn (who appears in the film). The polite smile dies on Hershey\u2019s lips.\n\u201cI never looked at the film that way, I just looked at it purely for itself. You know, yeah. I don\u2019t really have a lot of comment about that,\u201d she says carefully.\nI ask what she thinks of the vilification of Allen over the past decade, with the public and media largely assuming he molested his daughter Dylan, despite his having been cleared by two investigations in the 90s.\nShe sighs, considering her answer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame. I think people should have fair trials and I don\u2019t know if he did. People rushed to all kinds of judgments and that probably says more about them than what happened \u2013 nobody knows what happened, really. I like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I don\u2019t know what happened either,\u201d she says.\nDespite the difficulty in finding roles once a female actor dares to go north of 40, Hershey has never stopped working. Yet the film she\u2019s probably best known for today is Beaches, in which she starred alongside Bette Midler. The 80s was the great era for weepy movies about women, with Terms of Endearment, Steel Magnolias and Beaches, and I ask Hershey if she thinks they could be made today. \u201cHmm. I\u2019m not sure. I like to think so, but they might need another hook,\u201d she says.\nLike many films about and for women, Beaches was critically panned when it came out. \u201cThey called it a \u2018chick flick\u2019, which really offended me, because a movie with two men is called a film,\u201d Hershey says drily. \u201cBut when we were making it, I felt that it was important because it showed that friendship between women is powerful and important, and as the years have gone by, people keep coming up to me saying: \u2018I saw it with my best friend and it changed my life\u2019, \u2018I saw it with my mother \u2026\u2019 The repercussions are so strong and that pleases me a lot.\u201d\nMost pleasingly, she and Midler stayed close after the film and would often go out to dinner together when they lived near to one another. \u201cYou see people do a double take at us, and that\u2019s fun. I\u2019ll always love her,\u201d she says.\nI ask Hershey if she\u2019s going to take a little break after The Manor, and she laughs. \u201cI love when people say that to actors, \u2018Take a break,\u2019\u201d she says, clearly thinking about the aforementioned scrabbling for roles. I ask what she does when she\u2019s not scrabbling. Painting, mainly, she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m learning Italian now. I like learning. I\u2019m not closing doors, I\u2019m opening them.\u201d\n The Manor is part of the Welcome to the Blumhouse series and available on Amazon Prime from 8 October",

Ramsey will captain Wales in the absence of the injured Gareth Bale on Friday in their crucial World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic in Prague but arrives undercooked after starting one Serie A game this season.\nRamsey has featured four times for Juventus this seasonMassimiliano Allegri\u2019s side this season, playing 105 minutes, 59 on the opening day when he started against Udinese, and preparation has not been ideal for a match that will probably decide whether Wales or the Czech Republic finish second behind Belgium in Group E and secure a spot in the play-offs for Qatar 2022.\n\u201cI know what I can do and with the right management I can stay fit for a long period of time and play a lot of games,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI\u2019m still feeling good, when given the opportunity and managed correctly. It has been frustrating, that I have picked up these little niggly injuries which have cost me a lot of games and meant I have missed some important games for Wales in the last couple of years.\u201d\nRamsey started every game as Wales reached the last 16 at Euro 2020 in the summer but has not played a qualifier since his double secured passage to those finals against Hungary in November 2019. The 30-year-old midfielder has struggled to make a regular impact at Juventus, whom he joined after leaving Arsenal on a free that year.\n\u201cThe training philosophy and methods are different at my club than they are here [with Wales],\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of people here who have a number of years of managing me so they know how to get the best out of me and so I am able to play a number of games in a row. As I showed in the Euros this year, I\u2019m capable of doing that and producing good performances.\n\u201cMy outputs in games are pretty high and maybe I need a bit more rest and recovery throughout the week rather than being on the grass for a long period of time and carrying more fatigue into games. Recovery is a big part of that for me.\u201d\nRobert Page, the Wales interim manager, said it was a \u201ccrying shame\u201d that Ramsey was not playing regularly. Bale has a hamstring injury but is expected to return for November qualifiers at home to Belarus and the group leaders, Belgium, and Ben Davies and David Brooks are absent for trips to the Czech Republic and Estonia, who Wales face on Monday, because of illness.",

And secondly, that we do not assume that any organisation in our society, however well respected, is somehow immune from the misogynistic culture that pervades our whole society.\u201d\nSturgeon told MSPs there had been \u201ctoo many painful reminders\u201d in recent weeks of the spectrum of abuse that women experienced, from inappropriate comments through to discrimination in the workplace through to violence and serious sexual assault.\n\u201cI hope we are finally at a turning point where we stop expecting women to fix these problems, and we put the full glare where it belongs, on men who behave in a deeply unacceptable and misogynistic way.\u201d\nTo applause from across the chamber, she concluded: \u201cI would say to all men in this chamber and all men across the country: challenge it if it\u2019s on the part of other men that you know, challenge your own behaviour, and then let\u2019s collectively turn the corner so that women can live free of the fear of harassment, abuse, intimidation, violence, and in the worst cases, death.\u201d\nHer remarks come amid ongoing institutional soul-searching about how best to tackle street harassment and violence against women following the deaths of Sarah Everard, Sabina Nessa and countless others. In Scotland, Malone\u2019s case, which concluded earlier this week, has likewise heightened concerns about sexism within the police force.\nA Scottish government working group led by Helena Kennedy is considering whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime, and last weekend the Scottish justice secretary, Keith Brown, said he believed such a move would be a \u201cvery important signal that these behaviours are not acceptable in society from men\u201d.\nThere have been calls for similar legislation in England and Wales, spearheaded by the Labour MP Stella Creasy, and in March the UK government announced it would require police forces across England and Wales to collect data on crimes apparently motivated by hostility towards women.\nThis week, Boris Johnson said he did not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, saying there was \u201cabundant\u201d existing legislation to tackle violence against women.",

        "content": "While the US has been engulfed in a heated battle to prevent people from contracting and dying from Covid-19, another pandemic has been raging behind closed doors among children who have lost one or both parents, or their caregivers, to Covid.\nA new study, published on Thursday in the journal Pediatrics, estimated that from April 2020 through 30 June this year, more than 140,000 children under the age of 18 lost their mother, father, or grandparent who provided their housing, basic needs and daily care to the disease.\nThe study reveals that Covid is not only disproportionately killing adults from communities of color, but the children in these communities are bearing the brunt of the aftershock of this \u201chidden pandemic\u201d, said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Nida), which co-funded the study.\nAlthough people of racial and ethnic minority groups make up 39% of the US population, the study shows about 65% of children who lost a primary caregiver as a result of Covid are from minority Hispanic, Black, Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native families. Thirty-five per cent are white.\n\u201cThe death of a parental figure is an enormous loss that can reshape a child\u2019s life,\u201d Volkow said. But researchers say the needs of these children have been largely overlooked.\n\u201cCompared to white children, American Indian/Alaska Native children were 4.5 times more likely to lose a parent or grandparent caregiver, Black children were 2.4 times more likely, and Hispanic children were 1.8 times more likely,\u201d Nida said.\nThe study was a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Imperial College London, Harvard University, Oxford University and the University of Cape Town. Researchers used mortality, fertility, and census data to estimate Covid-associated orphanhood, which they define as the death of one or both parents, or the death of a custodial or co-residing grandparent who was primarily responsible for caring for a child or lived in the same household as the parent and assisted in caring for the child.\n\u201cAddressing the loss that these children have experienced \u2013 and continue to experience \u2013 must be one of our top priorities, and it must be woven into all aspects of our emergency response, both now and in the post-pandemic future,\u201d Susan Hillis, a CDC researcher and lead author of the study, said.\nThe study also revealed startling geographic disparities among minority children who have been affected by a Covid death.\nCalifornia, Texas, Florida and New York, the states with the largest populations, have the highest number of children who have lost a primary caregiver directly or indirectly from Covid. Researchers also found that \u201cin southern states along the US-Mexico border, including New Mexico, Texas, and California, between 49% and 67% of children who lost a primary caregiver were of Hispanic ethnicity\u201d.\nIn contrast, 45-57% of children in the southeastern states of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, who lost a primary caregiver, are Black. And, most of the American Indian/Alaska Native children who lost a caregiver reside in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Montana and South Dakota.\nMississippi\u2019s health department recently reported a decrease in the number of Covid cases and deaths after reaching an all-time high in August and early September, but as of Wednesday, the state continues to have the highest Covid death rate per capita than any other state, with 328 deaths per 100,000 residents. New Jersey has the second-highest death rate followed by Louisiana and Alabama.\nMississippi\u2019s vaccination rate, which was also the lowest in the nation at one point, has increased along with Alabama and Louisiana, but this trio still has among the lowest vaccination rates in the US.\nVolkow said children who experience orphanhood and other adverse events at an early age are at a greater risk for multiple physical and mental health conditions including suicide. They are also at an increased risk for drug abuse, sexual abuse and exploitation, and engaging in sexually risky behavior, dropping out of school or joining a gang.\nVolkow, the authors of the study and child advocates say the US must take swift action to include caring for children in the country\u2019s Covid response strategy by creating an effective plan to protect them, support their families, and address underlying structural inequities and health disparities. This plan must prioritize keeping children in their families. If that is not possible, Volkow said, there must be careful oversight of the foster family to avoid neglect and abuse \u2013 \u201cotherwise these children do not have a chance\u201d.\n\u201cWhen a child cannot live with their birth parent, almost always the preference would be to place the child with a relative,\u201d said Tyreasa Washington, Child Trends\u2019 senior program area director for child welfare. Family placement, known as kinship care, provides more stability and is less traumatizing for a child than putting the child with non-kin foster parents, said Washington, a clinical social worker.\n\u201cChildren also have better behavior and academic outcomes, and they are more likely to stay connected with their birth parents and siblings, as well as their culture,\u201d she added.\nThis article was amended on 10 October 2021 to clarify that although people of racial and ethnic minority groups make up 39% of the US population, about 65% of children who lost a primary caregiver as a result of Covid are from minority Hispanic, Black, Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native families.",

After Ensing was caught by the peloton, Lourdes Oyarbide of Movistar Team launched a lone attack of her own with Anna Christian (Drops-Le Col s/b Tempur) trying to bridge across.\nOyarbide was eventually swallowed up by the peloton before Wiebes won the second intermediate sprint at Woodham Ferrers with 92.3km raced. There were numerous late attacks and Elise Chabbey (Canyon-SRAM) won the only categorised climb of the day at Hambro Hill.

It was a chaotic final and at one point before the downhill we lost each other but I found my way and was able to finish the teamwork off and win the stage.\u201d\nWiebes\u2019s Dutch compatriot Demi Vollering (Team SD-Worx) stayed out of trouble to maintain her 1min 9sec general classification lead over Juliette Labous (Team DSM), with Clara Copponi (FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope) in third place overall.

I just don\u2019t worry about those things. I have been very fortunate in the past, I have had lots of ups and downs but had an amazing time, a lot of growth. I just don\u2019t worry about \u2018what if?\u2019 That\u2019s up ahead, I just try and prepare for now.\n\u201cUltimately you\u2019ve got to enjoy it. What an amazing season it has been so far, it has been super-exciting for fans. We finally see two teams neck and neck, which is amazing.\u201d\nHamilton leads Verstappen by two points after the Dutch driver made a superb recovery for Red Bull at the last round in Russia, finishing second after starting at the back of the grid because of a penalty for fitting a new engine.\nVerstappen is 24 and in his first title fight but insisted he was similarly unperturbed by the closest competition between teams F1 has seen since 2014. \u201cEven if we finish second we have still had a great season and it\u2019s not going to change my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy what we are doing so for me there is not much to worry about.\u201d\nWith seven races remaining Mercedes are considering installing a new power unit for Hamilton in Turkey, which would be his fourth, so as with Verstappen at Sochi he would start from the back of the grid.\nThe principal, Toto Wolff, confirmed Mercedes were looking at their options. If they are to take the penalty, selecting where they can minimise the potential points lost will be imperative. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen and how is not yet decided. Most important is that you don\u2019t DNF because of a reliability issue.\u201d",

Sign up now!\nSo imminent it may already have been signed and sealed by the time you\u2019re reading this, Mike Ashley\u2019s sale of Newcastle United to a Saudi Arabia-led consortium has provided grist to the mill of daily football emails so desperate for #content during the international break that Wednesday\u2019s fun-filled epistle was about austerity, welfare cuts and Boris Johnson telling fibs at the Tory party conference. But with the Newcastle takeover the only show in town, today it behoves us to put such depressing pontifications on the back-burner and address far more cheery topics. Specifically, the reprehensible human rights abuses, torture, executions, state-sanctioned assassinations and bombings for which the Premier League club\u2019s prospective new owners are responsible.\nBut first, a pre-emptive strike in an almost certainly futile bid to halt the inevitable whataboutery of Geordies who will of course complain that they alone are being picked on by the Fiver and Big Paper, while the moral shortcomings of owners of clubs like PSG, Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Leicester and others go unremarked upon. They haven\u2019t gone unremarked upon; they have been remarked upon repeatedly at great length and will continue to be remarked upon long into the future. The evidence is there, freely available and easily accessible on Big Website.\nThe latest development in this ongoing, acrimonious saga came about when Saudi Arabia resolved its TV piracy row with Qatari network beIN Sports, and provided questionable assurances that the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund (headed by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Salman), not Saudi Arabia (headed by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Salman) itself will be in charge of the day-to-day running of Newcastle. The same PIF, incidentally, that friend of the Fiver and Big Boy writer Tariq Panja pointed out owns the airplanes in which members of a murder squad were flown to and from Istanbul in order to assassinate journalist Jamal Khashoggi, before chopping him into tiny pieces with a bone saw. We can but presume the Premier League considered this a massive coincidence.\nFed up with seeing their club reduced to shuffling zombie status under the stewardship of the hated sports tat tycoon Mike Ashley, some Newcastle fans are prepared to look past the myriad moral shortcomings of the new regime of sports-washers, if it means replacing Ashley with somebody even more loathsome who might buy them expensive upgrades on Sean Longstaff and Matt Ritchie. Celebrating Ashley\u2019s departure is all well and good, but actively cheerleading on behalf of a replacement responsible for far worse atrocities seems more than a little grim.\nThe Fiver gets it. We really do. Newcastle fans love their club and hordes of them have remained loyal to it through thick and an awful lot of recent thin. They are desperate for a change of ownership and have no say whatsoever in who gets to take over from Ashley. And if this desperation means being exploited as unpaid propagandists by a tyrannical regime trying to buff and polish its global image, then so be it. It would, however, be mildly reassuring if the only dilemma most Geordies find themselves grappling with now they\u2019ve hit the jackpot didn\u2019t solely revolve around which \u00a3100m player to spend their winnings on first.\nUpdate: Twenty minutes late \u2013 not bad for a Fiver prediction\nIt\u2019s Thursday, it must be Belgium 1-2 France in the Nations League semi-final.

The Biden administration argued that Texas has waged an attack on the constitutional right to abortion.\nSB 8, passed last month, bars abortions after six weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest and also allows private citizens to sue anyone they suspect of \u201caiding or abetting\u201d the procedure.\nBut questions remain if the ruling will hold. The state of Texas has already filed a notice that they will appeal the decision to the fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans, a notably conservative court. The appeals court previously denied a request from abortion clinics to block the law.\nEven with the law on hold, abortion services in Texas may not instantly resume because doctors still fear that they could be sued without a more permanent legal decision.\n\u201cSB8 has wreaked havoc on Texans. We\u2019ll continue to fight until our right to abortion care is permanently restored,\u201d tweeted the Texas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nMany have voiced their approval with Pitman\u2019s decision, including reproductive rights groups and prominent figures in the Democratic party.\n\u201cWhile this fight is far from over,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in a statement, \u201cwe are hopeful that the court\u2019s order blocking SB 8 will allow Texas abortion providers to resume services as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe US attorney general, Merrick Garland, called the decision a \u201cvictory for women in Texas and for the rule of law\u201d. \u201cIt is the foremost responsibility of the Department of Justice to defend the constitution,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to protect constitutional rights against all who would seek to undermine them.\u201d\n\u201cThis is good news. Judge Pitman\u2019s ruling is the right one. Women\u2019s freedom to decide over their bodies needs to be protected, not put to the criteria of private individuals seeking a bounty. We must continue fighting to protect Roe v Wade,\u201d tweeted Texas representative Sylvia Garcia.\nThe White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, described Pitman\u2019s decision as \u201can important step forward toward restoring the constitutional rights of women across the state of Texas\u201d and confirmed that Joe Biden supports \u201ccodifying\u201d the supreme court\u2019s Roe v Wade ruling.\n\u201cThe fight has only just begun, both in Texas and in many states across this country where women\u2019s rights are currently under attack,\u201d Psaki said.\nPlanned Parenthood on Friday released a report saying that if Roe v Wade were overturned, 26 states are primed to ban abortion. This year alone, nearly 600 abortion restrictions have been introduced in statehouses nationwide, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood.\nAn even bigger challenge to abortion access could come later this year when the supreme court is set to hear Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a case from Mississippi on if states are able to ban abortions before fetal viability.\n\u201cThe fight is far from over, but this is seriously good news,\u201d tweeted Naral Pro-Choice America in response to the block.\nIn the face of the decision, some Texas abortion clinics announced their plans to resume abortions that were previously barred under Texas\u2019s rule. Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a network of abortion clinics, has said they plan to resume abortions up to 18 weeks \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\n\u201cThis is the justice we have been seeking for weeks and we are grateful that the court has finally stepped in to curb some of the harm Texans have faced,\u201d said Whole Woman\u2019s Health founder and CEO, Amy Hagstrom Miller.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting.",

They were showing solidarity with the two women who have made allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Paul Riley, the North Carolina Courage coach.\nSinead Farrelly and Mana Shim, who are both former NWSL footballers, made the claims in a report published in The Athletic last month. Riley, who was subsequently sacked by the Courage, denies any wrongdoing.\nSkinner, who took over at United in the summer, formerly coached the NWSL\u2019s Orlando Pride. He was asked about the show of support, in which players linked arms in the sixth minute of games on Wednesday.\n\u201cOne of the things I absolutely adored about the NWSL was how players will stand up for what they believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all the allegations are true and everything: absolutely those players [should] want to be protected. It should not happen. I thank the players for standing up for what they believe is right and getting the justice they deserve.\u201d\nThe 38-year-old, whose side host Manchester City in the derby at Leigh Sports Village on Saturday, also talked about the procedures he employs as a man working in women\u2019s sport. He was previously a teacher and his partner is the former England defender Laura Bassett.\n\u201cI was a teacher before a soccer coach \u2013 so I\u2019ve always done that because we always did safeguarding training,\u201d he said. \u201c[For example] you don\u2019t lock yourself in a room on your own [with anyone], you\u2019re always visible. You don\u2019t inappropriately touch players in terms of any contact that\u2019s not welcome \u2013 a fist bump, something like that [is OK].\n\u201cI like to say it\u2019s common sense but I know it\u2019s not. You have to train it. It\u2019s absolutely a part of everything I do. I made a deal I would never work with my partner in football, because I felt that it would cross the divide.\u201d\nUnited have won three of their four Women\u2019s Super League matches and are fourth. Manchester City, on the other hand, have won only once and sit third-bottom. \u201cI expect it to be a wonderfully electric kind of moment,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cFor us it\u2019s another team we have to play with the added emotion of it being one of these games. Where I want us to get is that we are ruthless regardless of the opponent.\u201d",

        "content": "Sadler\u2019s Wells, LondonA zany array of characters gather in a 1930s pub for a poignant, chilling and understated portrait of love, lust and longing\nThe Midnight Bell is Matthew Bourne\u2019s bleakest work to date but it\u2019s up there with his best. The mood is fitting given that the source material is the novels of Patrick Hamilton, chronicler of the lonely, needy and seedy in alcohol-soaked 1930s Soho. Turning the likes of Hangover Square and The Slaves of Solitude into dance is a tall order, the gap between the books\u2019 grim realism and dance theatre\u2019s artifice awkwardly wide, but he pulls it off (if not quite plunging to the dank depths of the originals \u2013 you can\u2019t send people home that hopelessly depressed). Rather than staging the novels, Bourne collects Hamilton\u2019s characters, plus a few of his own making, in the smoke-stained pub The Midnight Bell, where they gather in search of a drink and desperate connection.\nTheir eyes and bodies meet, but their duets are full of resistance too and humiliation is never far away. There\u2019s the fresh-faced barmaid, too polite to extricate herself from an admirer; the spinster attracting the attention of a cad, who thaws her froideur and steals from her purse; there\u2019s the chirpy barman, puppyishly in love with a sex worker (an autobiographical storyline based on Hamilton\u2019s own doomed love affairs); the two men furtively finding each other; and most chillingly, George Harvey Bone (from Hangover Square), a man with schizophrenia who fantasises about strangling the woman who eludes him.\nThe dancers move in ever-shifting permutations, like chess pieces on a crowded board, artfully skirting out of one another\u2019s way or falling into tense entanglements. The Midnight Bell belongs to the same school as Play Without Words: it\u2019s not the danciest of Bourne\u2019s works but the characters\u2019 physical signatures are clearly defined. It\u2019s all there in their gait, whether the slight stoop of Bone (a very good Richard Winsor, never overegging it), the tightly held body of Miss Roach (Michela Meazza, with plenty of subtlety playing out on her face), or the rubbery bounce of waiter Bob (an endearing Paris Fitzpatrick), optimistically kicking his heels.\nAlthough in a way little happens, the show is well paced, the characters\u2019 small journeys both seismic and insignificant, like most lives. It works because Bourne is all over the small details, from the way Jenny (Bryony Wood) slouches on the bed to the timing of a hiccup. The choreography is tight and the cast are strong. Liam Mower and Andrew Monaghan have the most to explore dance-wise \u2013 and emotionally too, navigating a gay relationship on the fringes of acceptability, even to Monaghan\u2019s own character.\nThe show\u2019s success owes much to the atmosphere created by Bourne\u2019s collaborators: Paul Groothuis\u2019s sound design, the birdsong and footsteps and car engines that make the city hum even in the early hours; and Lez Brotherston\u2019s designs, cleverly shifting to indicate a warren of Soho streets, just a red roof and a receiver to represent a telephone box; all enhanced by Paule Constable\u2019s lighting. Fundamental is Terry Davies\u2019 unusually textured score, which becomes heady and maudlin: the sound of three or four whiskies. In between, the characters lip-sync 1930s songs as monologues addressed to the audience: Leslie Hutchinson\u2019s recording of What Is This Thing Called Love stands out, sounding hollow, mournful and perfectly pitched for this show\u2019s searing portrait of love\u2019s pathetic disappointments.\nAt Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 9 October. Then touring until 27 November.",

It said 71% of forecourts in the region had both grades, compared with 90% elsewhere.\nThe industry group said the shortage was proving harder to tackle in London and the south-east because there are typically more vehicles per station in the region due to the density of the population.\n\u201cThe recovery is simply not happening quickly enough,\u201d said Brian Madderson, the PRA\u2019s chairman. \u201cWe are into our 15th day of the crisis. There needs to be an independent inquiry into the crisis so that motorists are protected from such acute fuel shortages in the future.\u201d\nHe said forecourts in the capital and the south-east were reporting \u201cchaotic delivery schedules\u201d, citing one case of a tanker having to return to the depot full because it had arrived at a filling station that had just been stocked.\nMadderson said the government\u2019s decision to suspend competition law had been \u201ca failed experiment\u201d. The move allowed oil companies to share data to target deliveries to the areas hit hardest by the fuel shortage, but he said the PRA had not been involved in the information sharing.\nMeetings are understood to have taken place between the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and specialist hauliers and oil companies.\n\u201cIt is now time for the government to step back, reimpose competition law and restore market disciplines so that ordinary business incentives drive the fuel to the filling stations which need it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lesson for us all may be that, however well-intentioned the government is, regrettably officials do not have the ability nor the capacity to command and control a crisis such as this.\u201d\nThe PRA\u2019s executive director, Gordon Balmer, when asked how quickly the situation would be resolved, replied: \u201cOne would hope days.\u201d\nPetrol station stocks were already lower than normal before the panic-buying left many forecourts dry, figures from BEIS show. Average stock levels dropped to 33% for several days up to 22 September, down from the more normal level of 40-45%. Stocks dipped to 32% on the 23rd when reports that BP was preparing to ration fuel deliveries due to driver shortages hit the media.\nOn the 24th when queues began, stock levels shrank to 20%, and they slumped again to just 15% on the 25th when panic-buying gripped the UK.",

Many magistrates courts, after a period of fantastic commitment by volunteer magistrates throughout the pandemic, have little or no backlog of cases.

The manager is expected to be sacked, with Antonio Conte understood to be the top target to replace him. The Italian, who led Chelsea to the title in 2017, is out of work after leaving Internazionale. He has also won Serie A with Inter and Juventus.\nStaveley said: \u201cOur ambition is aligned with the fans \u2013 to create a consistently successful team that\u2019s regularly competing for major trophies and generates pride across the globe.\u201d She was forthright when asked whether the Premier League title was the long-term aim, telling Sky Sports News: \u201cAbsolutely \u2026 Newcastle United is the best team in the world. We want to see it get those trophies, obviously. At top of the Premier League, in Europe, but to get trophies means patience, investment, time.\u201d\nNewcastle have not won a major trophy since 1969 and the priority is to pull the team out of the relegation zone, starting at home to Tottenham a week on Sunday. Staveley declined to confirm Bruce would be in the dugout but said: \u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of Steve and we\u2019ve spoken to him.\u201d\nAfter a difficult two years in charge, Bruce seemed resigned to his fate, telling the Telegraph: \u201cNew owners normally want a new manager. I\u2019ve been around long enough to understand that. That decision is not up to me. I accept that and I will accept what comes my way. I have to wait to have those conversations with people when the time is right.\u201d\nStaveley and Jamie Reuben \u2013 the son of David Reuben \u2013 have been confirmed as directors and Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, will be the nonexecutive chairman. He is the only Saudi presence on the board even though PIF, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, owns 80% of the club. The remaining 20% is split evenly between RB Sports & Media, part of the Reuben Brothers empire, and PCP Capital Partners, led by Staveley and her husband, the British-Iranian financier Mehrdad Ghodoussi.\nRumayyan said: \u201cWe are extremely proud to become the new owners of Newcastle United, one of the most famous clubs in English football. We thank the Newcastle fans for their tremendously loyal support over the years and we are excited to work together with them.\u201d\nA new training ground and enhanced academy are expected to be among the early priorities, and hundreds of millions of pounds is in line to be invested in wider community and regional regeneration projects in the north-east. If many Newcastle fans are conflicted about the club having fallen into Saudi hands, Ashley\u2019s departure saw thousands crack open the stashes of alcohol stockpiled in readiness for a long-dreamed celebration marking Newcastle\u2019s sale.\nThere was a strong backlash from human rights groups, with Amnesty UK\u2019s chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh, saying the deal represented \u201ca clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football\u201d.\nStaveley defended her Saudi allies, saying PIF was \u201can autonomous, commercially-driven investment fund\u201d and \u201ca great partner for Newcastle\u201d. She said: \u201cAnybody that has any issues they know we\u2019re here and they need to come talk to us.\u201d\nThe keys of St James\u2019 Park were handed to owners capable of transforming Newcastle into one of the world\u2019s wealthiest clubs after Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on the Qatar-based beIN Sports. This allows Premier League, Uefa and Fifa matches to be broadcast legally again, and the Gulf kingdom has also promised to close pirate websites operating in the country.\nThe Saudi commerce minister and acting media minister, Majid bin Abdullah al-Qasabi, is understood to have played a key role in brokering the takeover. Once the Premier League was satisfied the Saudi state would not be involved in the day-to-day running of Newcastle the consortium passed its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test. \u201cAll parties are pleased to have concluded this process,\u201d the league said.",

Effectually she said gender was fact, the trans community got mad as shit, they started calling her a Terf \u2026 I\u2019m team Terf,\u201d the comedian said in the special, which is one of the most watched pieces of content on the streaming site.\n\u201cGender is a fact. Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. This is a fact,\u201d Chappelle added, before saying that \u201ctrans women\u2019s\u201d genitalia are \u201cnot quite what it is\u201d.\nThe 48-year-old comedian went on to say that he would like to \u201cnegotiate the release of DaBaby\u201d, the rapper who faced widespread criticism in July over his discriminatory comments towards people living with HIV/Aids.\nChappelle, who has previously been criticized for his trans-attacking comments in earlier comedy specials, has been widely condemned on social media since Tuesday.\nNetflix subscribers have urged the streaming platform to take down the special, with the National Black Justice Coalition saying, \u201cWith 2021 on track to be the deadliest year on record for transgender people in the United States \u2026 Netflix should know better. Perpetuating transphobia perpetuates violence.\u201d\nThe rights group went on to add, \u201cNetflix should immediately pull The Closer from its platform and directly apologize to the transgender community.\u201d\nJaclyn Moore, an executive producer of Netflix\u2019s show Dear White People, announced that she will no longer be working with Netflix after Chappelle\u2019s special, arguing that the company \u201ccontinue[s] to put out and profit from blatantly and dangerously transphobic content\u201d.\nGlaad, a media monitoring organization that was founded as a protest against defamatory coverage of the LGBT community, tweeted, \u201cDave Chappelle\u2019s brand has become synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities.\u201d\nTowards the end of The Closer, Chappelle joked that he would no longer make jokes that target the LGBTQ+ community, saying, \u201cI am not telling another joke about you until we are both sure that we are laughing together.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s done, I\u2019m done talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I ask of your community, with all humility: Will you please stop punching down on my people?\u201d he said in reference to DaBaby and other Black celebrities such as Kevin Hart who have faced criticism for homophobic comments.\nYet despite his pledge, users were quick to argue that Chappelle failed to recognize that Black and LGBTQ+ identities are not mutually exclusive.\n\u201cMake no mistake: Black LGBTQ+ and same gender people exist \u2013 and have always existed. The fight against oppression is not a zero sum game, and the pervasiveness of white supremacy in the United States is not an excuse for homophobia or transphobia,\u201d said the National Black Justice Coalition statement.",

We respected the contract. The contract foresaw this situation and obviously the company will defend its interests firmly.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Pommellet and Bernard Emi\u00e9, head of France\u2019s external intelligence and security agency, the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure (DGSE) in France, gave evidence to the Senate committee looking into the defence debacle.\nEarlier, at a cross-party meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced the French ambassador to Australia Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault would be returning to Canberra but did not give a date when.\nAs a response to the Aukus announcement, Th\u00e9bault was recalled along with France\u2019s ambassador to Washington in an unprecedented move.\nThe Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he welcomed France\u2019s decision to return its ambassador to Canberra, adding that he looked forward to \u201ctaking the relationship forward\u201d.\nMorrison told reporters on Thursday the Australia-France relationship was \u201cbigger than a contract\u201d. Australia welcomed France\u2019s presence and influence in the Indo-Pacific, he said.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a matter of basically picking up on all the things we were working on and continuing on with them because they\u2019re very significant. They\u2019re wide-ranging. They\u2019re very much in our interests and France\u2019s interests and we look forward to just getting on with that job.\u201d\nMacron is not believed to have spoken to Morrison since the fallout over the contract; an Elys\u00e9e spokesperson said the country\u2019s ambassador would return to Canberra with a clear framework for future talks.",

        "content": "Tour operators welcome lifting of Covid restrictions on 47 countries and urge government to simplify testing protocols \u2013 and resist U-turns\nTravel industry insiders predicted a surge in bookings for October half-term as ministers cut England\u2019s travel red list to just seven countries, all in Latin America: Peru, Colombia, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Venezuela. Travellers from other destinations will no longer have to quarantine in a hotel on their return to the country.\nThe decision to reduce the red list from 54 countries to seven was taken at a meeting on Thursday morning, after discussions about the safety of opening the country\u2019s borders.\nUPDATE: From Monday (11th Oct) \ud83d\udcc5 I\u2019ll be cutting 47 destinations from our red list \u2013 including South Africa, with just 7 countries and territories remaining \u26a0\ufe0f - all others will be included in the \u201crest of world\u201d category \ud83c\udf10 [1/3]\nTravel rules changed earlier this week to scrap the traffic-light system that graded countries red, amber or green. Now there are just two lists: \u201cred\u201d and \u201crest of the world\u201d.\nPaul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, said the announcement was \u201cmajor progress\u201d for the industry, but called on the government to further simplify the rules on testing for holidaymakers.\nHe predicted that there would be an almost \u201cimmediate surge\u201d in holiday bookings. \u201cThis is a highly significant moment and it will give people the confidence to go abroad again. It really is encouraging for the travel industry and it shows that it is perfectly safe, as long as you are vaccinated, to start travelling again. But what we need the government to do now is to remove any layers of complexity around testing.\u201d\nDiscussions are currently taking place on when PCR tests can be replaced with significantly cheaper lateral flow tests with the government only saying the change will take place by the end of October. Currently, fully vaccinated travellers need a negative PCR test to avoid isolation from non-red list countries.\nLiz Matthews, UK general manager of Flight Centre, said the decision was a \u201cmassively positive step\u201d: \u201cThe vast majority of the world is now open to UK travellers, with just a few destinations off-limits.\u201d\nFlight Centre bookings doubled after the scrapping of the amber list last month, and now the company anticipates high demand for winter sun destinations including Mexico, Bali and South Africa. Looking ahead to January, peak sales month for flights, Matthew said: \u201cBy far the most important thing now is that we don\u2019t see any backtracking or U-turns.\u201d\nPablo Caspers of online agency Opodo said there was clear evidence of \u201can appetite to travel more widely\u201d in the week leading up to the announcement. UK searches for travel to Brazil were up 184% on the previous week and searches to South Africa increased by 163%.\nTeresa Bennett of the Natural Travel Collection said previous changes to travel rules had had an immediate impact. \u201cWhen Egypt and the Maldives came off the red list [on 22 September], we had calls and emails from customers within hours. The increased business to just two destinations meant I could increase the hours of my sales staff.\u201d\nHowever, she cautioned that travel to some destinations not on the red list may remain difficult, either because they are not yet open to UK travellers or for logistical reasons. \u201cThe government lifted its advice against non-essential travel to Madagascar on Wednesday, for example \u2013 but there are no flights there from the UK.\u201d\nEmma Coulthurst of price comparison site TravelSupermarket said bookings this week remained at nearly double the level seen before the dismantling of the traffic light system. Popular destinations included Tenerife, New York, the Costa Blanca and Fuerteventura.\n\u201cThe scrapping of pre-departure tests from 4 October continues to have a major impact on bookings,\u201d she said, \u201cwith many people booking late-season trips to the Med. Fully 40% of all bookings in the past week are for October get-aways. People are really keen to get away.\u201d\nTom Power of Pura Aventura, which specialises in holidays to Latin America, was \u201cdelighted\u201d to see several countries removed from the red list. He said the timing was particularly good for Chile, which is reopening to international travellers this month.\nPower believes people remain nervous at the prospect of long-haul flights, partly for fear of the rules changing while they are away. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for people to get used to travelling again,\u201d he said. For adventure travel, he expects the latest announcement to most benefit those whose trips to, say, Patagonia or Antarctica were deferred during the pandemic.\nSue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators said that with half-term in England and Wales just two weeks away, the announcement had come too late. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to give a boost to the travel industry \u2013 people aren\u2019t just going to go out and book a safari tomorrow.\u201d She criticised transport secretary Grant Shapps for a lack of consultation with industry experts and accused him of \u201ctrashing travel and tourism\u201d.\nThe red list is next expected to be updated on 28 October.",

She said Energy UK had \u201cresisted saying \u2018I told you so\u2019 until now\u201d.\nAt the annual energy conference, leaders from across the sector gathered together in the midst of a period of huge upheaval.\nAlso on the agenda were government pledges to eliminate net carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2035 \u2013 meaning gas, which provides more than 50% of the UK\u2019s power on windless days, must be almost entirely removed from the system.\nEnergy UK said it supported the end of investment in \u201cunabated\u201d gas, meaning plants that do not use technology such as carbon capture and storage to reduce emissions.\nPinchbeck said she supported the 2035 plan, which analysts have said could cost \u00a3200bn, but warned that government needed to back up its rhetoric with \u201cambitious\u201d policies. \u201cPledges are exciting but we want government to turn them into action,\u201d she said.\nOfficials at the department for business, energy and industrial strategy are understood to be considering measures to speed up the UK\u2019s transition to renewable energy, including more frequent wind farm auctions.\nConcrete proposals for reaching net-zero electricity by 2035 are expected to be included in an energy bill, building on a white paper published in December last year.\nThe bill is not expected before the end of 2021.",

        "content": "Explainer: Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund will control the Premier League club and can spend big in the transfer market\nA consortium of PIF, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media are taking over the Premier League club from the British billionaire Mike Ashley. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) is expected to hold 80% of the shares. The PIF is a sovereign wealth fund that since the early 1970s has taken the bulk of Saudi Arabia\u2019s savings from the sale of oil. It is worth about $430bn (\u00a3315bn), underscoring how little the \u00a3300m initial cost of its foray into Premier League football will figure on its balance sheet. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, becomes nonexecutive chairman of Newcastle United. PCP Capital Partners is a \u201cboutique international private equity firm\u201d founded by the British financier Amanda Staveley, who will have a seat on the Newcastle board. RB Sports & Media is part of Reuben Brothers, a British private equity and property firm owned by billionaire investors. Jamie Reuben, the son of David Reuben, will also sit on the board.\nMost emerging countries with large fossil fuel exports have a sovereign wealth fund of some kind. Many of them spread the risk of their investments by buying assets in developed countries where legal rules protect them from arbitrary changes to property rights. The Norwegian Bank Investment Fund is the largest of its kind with around $1.3tn of assets, followed by the China Investment Corporation, worth $1.2tn, and the $830bn Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\nPIF has also invested in the newly created industrial cities springing up across Saudi Arabia that are at the centre of Vision 2030, the Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plan to wean the economy off a dependency on oil. The US is the biggest recipient of PIF funds. During a visit to Saudi Arabia in 2017 by Donald Trump, PIF announced that it would be spending $40bn on infrastructure projects in the US. In 2020, PIF disclosed a stake in Boeing worth more than $700m, a $522m investment in the bank Citigroup and a $522m stake in Facebook, among many other investments in major US corporations.\nThere is nothing in the Premier League\u2019s rules to stop PIF from buying Newcastle. There is, notoriously, no clause in the league\u2019s \u201cowners and directors test\u201d that applies any moral or political focus to a buyer\u2019s suitability. The bid had been rejected because the Premier League believed the Saudi Arabian state to be a major supporter of online piracy of the league\u2019s TV broadcasts and had named Saudi Arabia on a list of pirates submitted to the US government. It also believed that the Saudi state was in control of PIF. It now no longer believes either of these things.\nThe Premier League says it has \u201cnow received legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club\u201d. Just this week legal arbitration over the precise connection between PIF and the Saudi state had been expected in the new year, but those proceedings have now been dropped. The Saudi government this week also agreed to lift a ban on the Qatari broadcaster beIN Sports in their country. BeIN is a major Premier League TV rights holder, last year committing to a reported $500m deal to broadcast matches in the Gulf and north Africa. An online pirate network, BeoutQ, thought to be run by the Saudis, has also stopped operating.\nAt this stage it is hard to quantify quite how great the change will be, but it is possible to argue Newcastle now have at least the potential to become the biggest club in the world. Already in possession of a large fanbase and a recognisable brand, a takeover by the richest owners in world football make their horizons limitless. The change will be a process, however, in part because of regulations around how much money a club can spend, such as FFP.\nIt\u2019s the abbreviation for financial fair play, a set of rules created by European football\u2019s governing body, Uefa, to stop its leading clubs from accruing unsustainable losses. While they apply only to clubs playing in European competitions, such as the Champions League, the Premier League has adopted its own variant to enable their clubs to stay compliant. Known as \u201cprofit and sustainability\u201d rules, they set limits on how much money a club can lose over a set period of time.\nBefore the pandemic, each Premier League club was allowed to lose a total of \u00a3105m over three seasons. Over the last two seasons greater losses have been allowed, with debts generated because of Covid taken off the total. Expenditure on youth development, community and women\u2019s football can also be deducted. Under FFP clubs can lose only \u00a35m each season, but losses of up to \u00a330m over a three-year period are allowed if they are covered by payments by the club\u2019s owner.\nYes, thanks to Mike Ashley. Ironically, the outgoing owner\u2019s reluctance to spend much money meant the club turned a \u00a335m profit between 2018 and 2020, with a loss of \u00a326m in 2019-20 which would actually be a profit of \u00a31m without Covid. Those totals, put together with the next three years of profit and sustainability allowances, mean the club could realistically spend more than \u00a3150m in the next year on new stars, hastening the transformation of the club.",

The trainers were first sent to Taiwan by the Trump administration but their presence had not been reported until now.\nThe report came as President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday that Taiwan will \u201cdo whatever it takes to defend its freedom and democratic way of life\u201d.\n\u201cTaiwan does not seek military confrontation,\u201d she told a security forum in Taipei. \u201cIt hopes for a peaceful, stable, predictable and mutually beneficial coexistence with its neighbours. But Taiwan will also do whatever it takes to defend its freedom and democratic way of life.\u201d\nUS troops have not been permanently based on the island since 1979, when Washington established diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nA Pentagon spokesman, John Supple, would not comment directly on the report, but noted that \u201cour support for and defense relationship with Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat\u201d from China.\n\u201cIt is an important step but it\u2019s intended primarily not to be provocative but actually improve the defence capability of Taiwan\u2019s forces,\u201d said Jacob Stokes, a fellow of the Indo-Pacific security programme of the Center for a New American Security.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always this balance between symbolism and substance, and I think by doing it quietly it\u2019s meant to be more substance.\u201d\nThe presence of US Marines Raiders in Taiwan has been previously reported, and was later confirmed by the Taiwan Navy Command as a \u201croutine Taiwan-US military exchange and cooperation training\u201d, according to US defence media and local outlets. US officials said the November 2020 reports were \u201cinaccurate\u201d but did not elaborate.\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry issued a statement urging the US to stop military aid to Taiwan.\n\u201cChina will take all necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d the statement said.\nHawkish state media outlet, the Global Times said on Friday that China\u2019s state council \u201cstrongly opposed any form of military collusion between Taiwan and the United States\u201d.\n\u201cWe urge the US to abide Three Communiqu\u00e9s on the Taiwan issue and stop any provocations. The DPP authorities work with external forces to seek \u201cindependence\u201d and reject reunification. This has led the people of Taiwan to disaster, and their attempts are bound to fail.\u201d\nThe report of a US military presence in Taiwan comes after a series of escalatory signals in the Indo-Pacific. China flew nearly 150 military planes, including bombers and fighter jets, into Taiwan\u2019s air defence zone, over the first four days of October.\nSpeaking to the BBC a day after meeting top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi, US national security advisor Jake Sullivan said that the US was deeply concerned about rising tensions in the region.\n\u201cWe are going to stand up and speak out, both privately and publicly when we see the kinds of activities that are fundamentally destabilising,\u201d Sullivan told the BBC.\nAsked if the US was prepared to take military action to defend Taiwan, Sullivan said: \u201cLet me just say this, we are going to take action now to try to prevent that day from ever coming to pass.\u201d\nSullivan also said it would be an \u201cenormous mistake\u201d to draw conclusions about the US commitment to its allies based on its recent withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nOn Thursday, the CIA confirmed it would be creating a new \u201cmission centre\u201d to prioritise intelligence gathering on China.\nAnnouncing the reorganisation, the agency\u2019s director, William Burns, called the Chinese government \u201cthe most important geopolitical threat we face in the 21st century\u201d.\n\u201cThroughout our history, CIA has stepped up to meet whatever challenges come our way,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd now facing our toughest geopolitical test in a new era of great power rivalry, CIA will be at the forefront of this effort.\u201d\nSeparate mission centres created by the Trump administration on Iran and North Korea are to be dissolved into broader regional sections.\nThe state department has taken similar steps, establishing an enlarged specialised office, known informally as the China House, as part of the Biden administration\u2019s broader pivot to Asia.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal report, the trainers in Taiwan rotate in and out, so it does not represent a permanent presence. There have been reports of US military advisers there over the years but Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University, said the significant factor in Thursday\u2019s report is the apparent confirmation by US officials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open secret they\u2019ve been doing training exercises here and there, but this is a big deal to publicly acknowledge them,\u201d Ku said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the benefit of that is. The Chinese government knows what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re not telling them \u2013 we\u2019re just telling the Chinese public, which will then create pressure on the government to do something.\u201d",

Only after satisfying regulators that the kingdom would not be involved in the running of the club has an end to Mike Ashley\u2019s 14-year tenure seemed likely.\nBut the association between a Premier League football team and a state seen as verging on pariah status by its many critics has more hurdles to jump before it can pass the public sniff test.\nIn accepting the Saudi state as an owner, Newcastle is taking on quite some baggage. Agreeing to such a takeover could be construed as acquiescing to a human rights record that has been condemned by rights organisations.\nThe butchering of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three years ago, the jailing and widely reported abuse of rights activists in Riyadh and a hardline intolerance of dissent generally has made Prince Mohammed an unpopular figure in Joe Biden\u2019s administration in the US and in parts of Europe.\nHis critics, among them Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, contend that the use of sports is a convenient mask for things the Kingdom wants people to forget about and that decisions like the Newcastle purchase are made with \u201csportswashing\u201d in mind.\nDig a little deeper and the motives are more primal \u2013 a Middle Eastern version of keeping up with the Joneses, a world where status is everything, is a key driver of the push to engage with global sport.\nAppearing relevant on the world stage is essential, especially when your neighbours have trumped you. And conspicuously displaying your wealth isn\u2019t far behind.\nTop flight football had been wildly popular in the kingdom even before societal shackles were dropped by its new regime. Saudi Arabia has a successful national team and the English Premier League is the most popular of the European football competitions.\nThe seeming embrace of the hard-charging, big-drinking culture behind Newcastle United may seem incongruous to a conservative and rigid country. And, in many ways it would have been, before Prince Mohammed entrenched his new guard and changed the nature of the country itself.\nCafes in Riyadh and Jeddah regularly teem with men and women watching football. The new accommodation is that personal freedoms \u2013 watching what you choose and choosing your company \u2013 is no longer forbidden.\nUnder the heir to the throne\u2019s regime, embracing aspects of western culture that may have been frowned upon five years ago is no longer taboo. Anything seen to threaten the seat of power is treated very differently.",

Stay forever.\u201d In Tilted Wig\u2019s new version of the popular gothic story, it\u2019s not somewhere you want to linger.\nThe show, loosely adapted from Washington Irving\u2019s short story, follows the arrival of schoolmaster Ichabod Crane (Sam Jackson) to the superstitious hamlet where he attracts the attentions of wealthy local leader Baltus Van Tassel (Bill Ward), his daughter Katrina (Rose Quentin) and the enigmatic widow Mariette Papenfuss (Wendi Peters). But something isn\u2019t quite right \u2013 in more ways than one.\nWriter Philip Meeks has turned Irving\u2019s slender tale into a sprawling mess of a plot. Every inhabitant of Sleepy Hollow \u2013 as well as incomer Ichabod \u2013 seems to be harbouring a deep, dark secret. This version is so eager to wrong-foot its audience that it turns the mystery into incoherence. It\u2019s not helped by the often garbled delivery of dialogue, in accents that skitter around the globe.\nFor a horror show, it\u2019s remarkably un-scary. In two and a bit hours, there are perhaps two genuine frights. The rest of the time, director Jake Smith tries to manufacture a chilling atmosphere with dry ice and a moody soundscape. Scenes are often short and baffling, punctuated with gloomily lit movement sequences, accompanied by creepy singing or tense music. These moments seem designed primarily to remind us that this is meant to be spooky.\nAt times, it almost feels like Meeks and Smith are sending up the whole genre, which would make for a more enjoyable evening. Instead, this is a muddled stew of tired horror tropes.\nAt York Theatre Royal until 9 October. Then touring until 4 December.",

        "content": "MPs and human rights groups ask parliament to look into how Sheikh Mohammed deployed sophisticated spyware\nMPs and human rights groups have called on ministers and parliament to investigate how the ruler of Dubai was able deploy sophisticated spyware to hack the phones of his ex-wife and her legal team in Britain last summer.\nTheir demands follow the revelation of the spying scandal on Wednesday, which emerged after English courts concluded that agents of Sheikh Mohammed had infiltrated Princess Haya\u2019s phone using controversial NSO Pegasus software.\nGraham Stringer, a Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee, said that the body had previously inquired into \u201cstate interference in this country by China and Russia\u201d and should now consider state-sponsored phone hacking.\n\u201cWe should look at it as a Commons committee,\u201d the MP said, adding that the British government also needed to undertake its own analysis of the fast-growing practice of sophisticated mobile phone surveillance.\nAn investigation by the Guardian earlier this year discovered that 50,000 phone numbers had appeared on a leaked list who were believed to be persons of interest to government clients of NSO Group since 2016. At least 10 countries \u2013 including the UAE, of which Dubai is part \u2013 had entered numbers into the system.\nWednesday\u2019s court rulings are the clearest example yet of Britons being targeted by NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware, which is sold to states for use against terrorists and organised criminals. It has the power to secretly take control of a person\u2019s phone, stealing personal data or turning on the microphone to record its surroundings.\nBut there have been repeated criticisms that activists, journalists and lawyers were also being targeted by government security agencies using the technology, with 400 other UK numbers appearing in the leaked list having been selected by the UAE.\nOthers who were victims of the hacking campaign, the courts concluded, were Fiona Shackleton, a high profile divorce lawyer, and a senior colleague who both were advising Haya in an acrimonious legal battle with Sheikh Mohammed over the welfare of her two children.\nHuman rights watchdog Amnesty International said the \u201ctargeting of UK citizens and residents by NSO Group\u2019s spyware\u201d should now prompt urgent and public inquiries by government agencies and parliamentary committees.\nDanna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty\u2019s technology unit, added: \u201cAuthorities in the UK \u2013 including parliamentary bodies \u2013 should conduct an immediate, independent, transparent, and impartial investigation.\u201d\nFormer Whitehall insiders said that there had been some concern about the growing availability of NSO\u2019s spyware, but also a recognition that, in practice, little could be done once the technology had been sold.\nThere was an informal agreement not to sell the technology to countries opposed to the UK and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence network, but the UAE is considered an ally. If Pegasus is then misused against British targets, it was impossible to prevent, the insider added.\nPublicly, the UK government only made a muted complaint. In its first statement since Wednesday\u2019s court rulings, the Foreign Office said all countries should use cyber surveillance \u201cin a way that is legal, responsible and proportionate\u201d.\nA government spokesperson added: \u201cThe UK-UAE bilateral relationship is strong\u201d \u2013 and then highlighted last month\u2019s visit of the country\u2019s crown prince and ruler, Mohammed bin Zayed, to London, where he met the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for a summit at Downing Street.\nIn response, Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dems justice spokesperson, accused ministers of being complacent: \u201cWe need an urgent investigation into what exactly happened and how this scandalous act of phone hacking has been allowed to take place.\u201d\nHaya, who was Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s sixth wife, fled Dubai for the UK in 2019 as their marriage broke down and she began to fear for both her and her children\u2019s safety. The intense court battle that followed made her increasingly feel under threat.\n\u201cIt feels like the walls are closing in on me,\u201d Haya said in a witness statement to the court. \u201cI feel like I am defending myself against a whole \u2018state\u2019\u201d.\nBut Sheikh Mohammed said the findings of hacking presented \u201can incomplete picture\u201d \u2013 and added: \u201cAs a head of government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters\u201d.\nThe judgments reveal that NSO Group alerted Haya\u2019s lawyers on 5 August, via its ethics adviser Cherie Blair, at around the same time a digital forensics specialist has also suspected that the phone hacking was taking place. NSO said the courts had expressed their \u201cappreciation of NSO\u2019s cooperation, which was given although NSO is not within the jurisdiction of the court\u201d.",

Therefore, no charges will be forthcoming,\u201d Clark county district attorney Steve Wolfson said in July 2019.\nRonaldo is one of the most famous athletes in the world. The 36-year-old is a five-time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or, an annual award for the best footballer in the world. He started his career at Sporting Lisbon before winning titles with Manchester United in England, Real Madrid in Spain and Juventus in Italy.

I am now looking forward. I am not going to cling on to that. I am still hungry for more, really.\u201d\nAfter receiving a first round bye as the tournament\u2019s 17th seed, Raducanu faces Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus, who is ranked 100th, in the second round. Sasnovich, who defeated Mar\u00eda Camila Osorio Serrano 6-0, 6-4 in the first round, is a 27-year-old veteran who has been ranked as high as 30th. In the third round the winner could face Simona Halep, whom Raducanu describes as one of her idols.\nWhile Raducanu has said her aim for the final tournaments of the year is to stay in the moment, she could also potentially qualify for the WTA Finals. She is 15th in the WTA Race rankings, with the top eight players qualifying for the event, which has temporarily been relocated from Shenzhen, China to Guadalajara, Mexico because of Covid. Ashleigh Barty and Naomi Osaka are both doubtful participants among those at present in the qualifying positions.\nRaducanu\u2019s packed schedule over the next month offers her the best chance of qualifying as she has also entered tournaments in Moscow, Cluj-Napoca and Linz.
