        "content": "His complex, ambivalent plays are regularly revived \u2013 and now a campaign aims to improve the playwright\u2019s resting place in a London cemetery\nWhat is the best tribute to a dead playwright? For their work to be regularly revived. On that score, admirers of Terence Rattigan have few grounds for complaint: his wartime comedy While the Sun Shines packed out the Orange Tree in 2019 and returns this month for the Christmas season. But Rattigan devotees are shocked that the family memorial in Kensal Green cemetery, west London, is in an appalling state and that, even though it is where the dramatist\u2019s ashes are buried, there is no record there of his name: a situation they are desperate to remedy by means of the Terence Rattigan Memorial Fundraising Project.\nThe case of Rattigan is a peculiarly fascinating one. After the success of French Without Tears in 1936, he became one of the most popular postwar playwrights, only to find himself ruthlessly marginalised after the Royal Court revolution of 1956. When I recently spoke at the annual dinner of the Terence Rattigan Society, I noticed that the critic Kenneth Tynan was widely seen as the villain of the piece. I tried to suggest that it wasn\u2019t just Tynan\u2019s reviews that led to Rattigan\u2019s fall from grace: his emotional reticence was at odds with the scorching candour of the rising generation and his formal elegance was viewed with hostility at a time when \u201cthe well-made play\u201d was a common pejorative. Typically, the radical theatre magazine Encore linked his name in the 1960s with Agatha Christie as symbols of the despised West End.\nThe whirligig of time, however, brings in its revenges and Rattigan\u2019s best plays are now revived for a variety of reasons. For a start, they are more ambivalent than they first appear. The Browning Version (1948) has always been seen as a study of the way a seemingly desiccated teacher, Crocker-Harris, defies public school orthodoxy by making a farewell speech and breaks off a loveless marriage: David Hare, whose South Downs in 2011 played in tandem with Rattigan\u2019s play, has argued that Crocker-Harris is really a closeted gay man who cleverly, and maybe not for the first time, enlists the emotional sympathy of his wife\u2019s lover. I\u2019m not saying I agree with Hare, but his reading lends the play an added complexity.\nThe Deep Blue Sea (1952) is Rattigan\u2019s most perfect play and a classic study of an upper-middle-class woman who has an unsatisfied physical and emotional passion worthy of a Racine protagonist. But I remember how Karel Reisz\u2019s 1993 production at London\u2019s Almeida persuaded me that this is also a state-of-the-nation play. Everyone in the piece, from the flying ace with no place in the postwar world to the struck-off emigre doctor to the stuffily conventional young marrieds, adds to a rich portrait of 1950s Britain.\nIf you want proof that Rattigan was often ahead of his time, rather than simply pandering to popular taste, you have only to look at Table Number Seven, which constitutes the second half of Separate Tables (1954). In that piece, the residents of a genteel hotel defy one of their bigoted number by rallying to the support of a bogus major accused of importuning: it is clear as day that his offence is more homosexual than heterosexual. Coming one year after Lord Montagu and Peter Wildeblood had been imprisoned on similar grounds and three years before the Wolfenden report advocated the decriminalisation of consensual sex between men, Rattigan\u2019s play struck a heartening blow for liberal reform.\nRattigan had his failures: I doubt I shall ever see again a musical version of French Without Tears misleadingly entitled Joie de Vivre. But he was a great playwright who understood better than most the inequality of passion and the fear of emotional expression that haunts our national psyche. He deserves a decent memorial and, for the sake of a few thousand pounds, a grave that can be respected.",

The Fabers hope that a spinal surgery scheduled for late December at a local hospital will help restore his balance and motor function.\nBut now they are worried that the hospital will have to postpone the operation.\nThat\u2019s because a recent surge in Covid-19 cases around the state has increased the number of unvaccinated patients needing care and prompted concerns that hospitals may have to ration services for other issues.\n\u201cIf you have been waiting for an elective procedure for the last 18 months and are finally scheduled \u2013 you\u2019re vaccinated, you don\u2019t have Covid \u2013 your procedure might still get canceled if a hospital is totally full,\u201d said Dr Anuj Mehta, a pulmonologist with Denver Health who serves on the governor\u2019s expert emergency epidemic response committee. \u201cWhile this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated at this point \u2013 and the surges in the hospital are entirely being driven by unvaccinated folks \u2013 it is having a massive bleed-over effect on to the entire population.\u201d\nThere are about 1,300 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in Colorado, according to the New York Times data; that\u2019s the highest number since December 2020, when more than 1,900 patients were hospitalized.\nThat number has increased by 15% over the last two weeks, the third largest increase in the country, and at a time when the national picture for the US is of a Delta variant surge that is firmly on the way down.\nThe trend in Colorado can be attributed in part to the almost 40% of the state population that has not been vaccinated and people again gathering indoors without masks. It also shows that, despite the national downward trends of infections, regional spikes can still happen that can cause havoc in state healthcare systems.\n\u201cWe clearly have events taking place in Colorado, as elsewhere, that are spreading infection,\u201d said Dr Jon Samet, an epidemiologist who directs Covid-19 modeling for the state. \u201cI know everyone would like for it to be 2019 all over again, but that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\nThe state had also not had surges on the scale of other states, said Dr Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth.\nOther states \u201chad flames from the get-go, whereas we have been smoldering along this whole time, and we are finally hitting that peak of saturation and seeing flames finally,\u201d said Barron.\nThirty per cent of Colorado hospitals are anticipating a shortage in the number of intensive care unit beds and 37% are anticipating staffing shortages within the next week, according to data from the Colorado department of public health and environment.\n\u201cStaffing is becoming increasingly a problem, which is true everywhere throughout the country. We are seeing healthcare workers really burned out from everything the last two years,\u201d said Mehta. \u201cIt just raises concerns that we are pushing the limits of how many patients we can take care of. We are still taking great care of everybody\u201d at Denver Health, \u201cbut we are filling up fast.\u201d\nIn response to the surge, Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, on Sunday issued a pair of executive orders that allow the state to direct healthcare facilities to redirect patients to other centers and for the implementation of a protocol for healthcare workers to decide in an emergency who should be treated first.\nMehta would also like to see the governor issue a statewide indoor mask mandate, something Polis has declined to do.\n\u201cIf we were to continue masking indoors, I think we would see a significant drop in transmission and hospitalization, and that would free us up to do the routine medical stuff that we do all the time,\u201d Mehta said.\nEven though people who have been vaccinated against Covid face a very low risk of hospitalization, they still, of course, face other risks. The UCHealth system is seeing record number of patients with non-Covid issues, according to a spokesperson.\n\u201cA year ago, most schools and businesses were virtual, and there were capacity limits on restaurants and other businesses,\u201d Dan Weaver vice-president of communications for UCHealth stated in an email. \u201cNow, with few people staying at home, we are seeing large numbers of traumas, other injuries, and non-Covid healthcare needs.\u201d\nEven among healthy Colorado residents, the pandemic continues to affect their lives. Stephanie Danielson, a Boulder resident, had 60 children in her son and daughter\u2019s Cub Scouts pack a year ago; there are now 10, in part because of ongoing concerns about the virus.\nThe pack gathered for a hike in September for the first time in more than a year \u2013 and afterwards learned that a parent had tested positive for Covid.\n\u201cAs a leader, it felt defeating because we are trying so hard to bring back some normalcy to each other\u2019s lives, and our very first time, we had this happen,\u201d said Danielson, who works at Moxie Sozo, a branding agency in Boulder.\nFaber, the 40-year-old CEO of the company, just got a vaccine booster and said his life has not changed much because of the surge. But he continues to worry about his father, a retired restaurant owner.\n\u201cEverything is so volatile, it\u2019s a waiting game to see if [the surgery] will still happen,\u201d said Faber. \u201cIt\u2019s the circle of people just outside of the direct impact from Covid that are dealing\u201d with the surge, \u201cand I know there are more severe examples than this\u201d.",

        "content": "Utopia is within our reach if we address the colonial, racist and oppressive roots of our current planetary crisis\nYoung people know that our generation already disproportionately feels the effects of the climate crisis. Almost all of the intense heatwaves that have hit Europe since 1950 occurred during my lifetime. It\u2019s likely they will only get worse.\nUnfortunately, Poland, where I live, has clung to an energy model driven by burning fossil fuels for too long. This irreversible destruction violates our right to life, health, property and values \u200b\u200bof the natural world. That is why at 17 years old, I decided to take the Polish government to court in June 2021 over its failure to act on the climate crisis.\nThe grim stakes for my generation are undeniable. It has been more than five years since world leaders pledged to limit global warming to 1.5C. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and according to the International Energy Agency emissions will hit a record high by 2023 if green recovery fails. The newest report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that human-caused emissions have already contributed to irreversible changes in our climate system, and are rapidly moving us toward an uninhabitable planet.\nWhat we really need as world leaders gather for the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow is a global system change. A world built on business as usual is clearly falling apart \u2013 it has already for the most vulnerable.\nThe world economy is reliant on constant growth and human exploitation in order to create profits. That\u2019s why it is no surprise to see that a country\u2019s rise in emissions correlates with its growth in GDP, energy consumption and pollution. But the capitalist growth model is incompatible with a zero-carbon world.\nBy popularizing concepts such as \u201cgreen growth\u201d or \u201cgreen capitalism\u201d, world leaders sentence humanity to a life of dystopia. Ultimately, these proposals are the same concepts that brought us into this crisis in the first place, but in disguise. Activists call it greenwashing for a reason.\nWhen high-income nations transition their economies toward \u201cgreen\u201d solutions, what happens to low-income nations? Will the global north continue to exploit other countries in order to deliver on their climate pledges while also growing their economies? And what about climate reparations for the most affected communities?\nWhile leaders of the global north continue to perpetuate the status quo built on the exploitation of others, they deepen the harsh socio-economic conditions in countries that bring them profits. In other words, high-income nations use \u201cgrowth\u201d as a justification for the torture caused in other territories.\nLow-income nations are robbed of their ability to address the climate crisis when more immediate issues become a necessary priority, such as feeding their people, securing access to electricity, quality healthcare and education or ending conflict. Climate change worsens these \u201cmore pressing\u201d issues, perpetuating the downward cycle even more.\nThe climate crisis may center on the term \u201cclimate\u201d, but it may be one of the biggest social crises humanity has ever faced. Hence, climate justice cannot be achieved without addressing and prioritizing social justice in all parts of the globe.\nI think about the climate crisis and its intersectional connections every single day. I started my activism journey more than two years ago and have called myself a full-time activist since summer 2020. While activism may take a toll on my physical and mental wellbeing, I find it\u2019s the best antidote for climate depression.\nUtopia quite literally means achieving a perfect imaginary world that doesn\u2019t exist (from Greek ou-topos \u2013 no place, nowhere). However, striving toward a near-utopian state is the only chance we have today to save humanity.\nIn today\u2019s world, limiting the global average temperature to 1.5C and achieving climate justice may seem out of reach due to the fundamentals on which the global north has built its societies. However, the miracle happens when one realizes that this system is not inherently this way \u2013 it was created.\nThe utopia we dream of is within our reach if we address the colonial, racist and oppressive roots of our current planetary crisis. Communities fighting on the frontlines have already been transforming their radical imagination of a fully liberated world into a reality.\nEverything has to change, especially our understanding of the impossible.",

        "content": "Oil companies and the banks that finance them are making empty promises \u2013 and getting credit for them too\nJPMorgan Chase won glowing headlines last year when the global investment bank unveiled a commitment to counter the climate crisis.\nThe press amplified JPMorgan\u2019s message \u2013 sometimes in JPMorgan\u2019s own words. Fortune published a commentary article trumpeting the bank\u2019s plans to \u201ctackle climate change\u201d. Six paragraphs into the piece, the writers noted they worked for the investment firm. (They were actually its top executives.)\nThe bank waited months to detail its plans. In May, it finally outlined its goals: JPMorgan would not pressure oil companies to lower their emissions. Instead, the firm would encourage them to become more efficient. They would focus on their \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d.\nThat metric has become a favorite of banks, oil companies and other big businesses. They\u2019ve balked at requirements to cut overall climate pollution. But \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d pledges have given companies a framework to keep investing in dirty fuels, while also expanding into pollution-capturing technology and cleaner energy.\n\u201cThey love the metric,\u201d said Jeanne Martin, senior manager of banking standards at ShareAction, a non-profit focused on responsible investment.\n\u201cThey have committed to reducing intensity and financing to the oil and gas sector. But that doesn\u2019t ultimately mean they will reduce oil and gas activities. It may actually increase at a faster rate.\u201d\nSuch \u201cgreenwashing\u201d, experts say, allows companies to downplay the scale of the climate crisis \u2013 and continue contributing to the problem.\n\nGreenwashing\u00a0is a form of marketing spin, in which companies persuade the public that their products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly. The term was coined by environmentalist Jay Westerveld in 1986 to refer to the corporate practice of making sustainability claims to cover a questionable environmental record.\nAn\u00a0absolute greenhouse gas emissions target\u00a0aims to reduce overall climate pollution by a specific amount.\u00a0\nA\u00a0net-zero goal\u00a0is meant to offset all greenhouse gas emissions by\u00a0 capturing them, planting trees to absorb them, or paying for the development of cleaner energy.\u00a0\nAn\u00a0intensity reduction\u00a0seeks to cut the rate of planet-heating emissions that accompanies each unit of energy produced.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the next five or 10 years that will determine our collective futures,\u201d said Andrew Logan, oil and gas director at Ceres, the non-profit that advocates for corporate sustainability.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably safe to say that there is no company \u2013 certainly in the financial sector, or heavy-emitting sectors \u2013 that has a fully defensible plan when it comes to meeting the scale and scope of the urgency of the climate challenge.\u201d\nWorld leaders are starting to find the gap between corporate rhetoric and action too glaring to ignore.\nHistorically, oil and gas companies have been top sponsors at international climate meetings, hosting events and prominently displaying advertisements with their climate goals.\nThat is beginning to shift. The UK, host of this week\u2019s landmark climate summit in Glasgow, will limit participation by companies unless they have a \u201ccredible short-term action plan\u201d to ratchet down emissions.\nBut in the run-up to this year\u2019s negotiations, oil companies are blitzing social media with advertisements about their climate pledges.\nIn a Facebook ad campaign launched this month, ExxonMobil promises to cut pollution from drilling. It plans to do that by reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon over the short term. That will lower the \u201cmethane intensity\u201d of its operations \u2013 but it ignores the emissions from customers burning the fuel itself.\n\u201cThe fossil fuel companies feel the heat and feel the pressure to do something about this, if they want to remain the main provider of energy,\u201d said Yamide Dagnet, the director of climate negotiations at World Resources Institute.\nRoyal Dutch Shell announced last week it will cut its absolute carbon emissions in half by 2030. But the commitment pertains only to the company\u2019s internal climate footprint, not the much larger share of emissions that occur when its fuels are burned for energy. The timing of the announcement is also notable, as it comes on the heels of a Dutch court ruling earlier this year that Shell must slash its emissions 45% by 2030.\nMost other fossil fuel companies \u2013 and the banks that finance them \u2013 continue to find alternatives to promising outright emissions reductions.\nA net zero goal signals a company aims to offset its emissions by adding cleaner energy projects to their portfolios, or attempting to capture carbon dioxide and stop it from entering the air. But these goals can be so narrow as to be meaningless.\nBeau O\u2019Sullivan, senior communications campaigner at the global social activist group Sunrise Project*, said fossil fuel companies were \u201cinoculating themselves from bank and shareholder pressure by making these net zero commitments\u201d.\nBP has the most aggressive decarbonization plans in the sector, according to an analysis by the global energy research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie.\nThe company aims to be net zero for its operations and upstream production by 2050 and to halve its carbon intensity by then. It has slashed its budget for oil exploration, and it\u2019s the only oil giant that has promised to cut production over the next decade.\nBut the devil is in the details \u2013 or the lack thereof.\nBP declined to comment on why it has excluded a large portion of its emissions in its net zero commitment, choosing not to calculate emissions from its more than 20% stake in the Russian company Rosneft. Rosneft explores for oil and gas in some of the most remote regions, including in ecologically vulnerable Siberia and the Arctic.\nThe company\u2019s lobbying also conflicts with its climate message. In 2020, BP left three associations because of their climate positions. But it is still a member of the American Petroleum Institute, which has lobbied against electric vehicle tax breaks, methane regulations and drilling restrictions in the Arctic.\nBP in a March 2021 report said it is working with API and other associations to move \u201con important issues such as support for the Paris Agreement, regulation of methane, carbon pricing and the role of climate science\u201d.\nCongrats @ProcterGamble on your net zero announcement! It\u2019ll take all of us, greening companies in every sector, to tackle climate change. Here's what we mean by greening companies: https://t.co/rO5dVyZoo6\" https://t.co/2lu9qKFouE\nThese greenwashing campaigns benefit more than just the oil companies.\nBanks are increasingly under pressure to drop their financing of fossil fuels. To defend their continued investments, they\u2019re pointing at oil companies\u2019 climate pledges.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now at a point where the very largest investors in the world, the investors who are the biggest shareholders in high-emitting companies, see climate change as a real threat to the financial health of whole sectors,\u201d said Miguel Jaller, the vice-chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis. Jaller was the lead author on a white paper that found intensity targets can play a role in emissions reductions, but aren\u2019t a one-size-fits-all tool.\n\u201cUltimately, climate change is an absolute problem that requires absolute reductions in emissions,\u201d Jaller said.\nBanks have begun to commit to shrink the carbon footprint of their own operations, including from powering their office buildings. But their biggest contributions to global heating are in the oil and gas companies they finance. Few have weaved in climate commitments with their financing strategies, although they are beginning to now.\nThe world\u2019s 60 largest banks financed nearly $4tn in fossil fuel projects between 2016 and 2020, according to a March report from a coalition of climate organizations including the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Sierra Club, BankTrack and more. That total includes lending, equity issuance and debt underwriting.\nJPMorgan is the largest financier of oil and gas projects in the world, according to the report. The US-based bank poured $51bn into the sector just in 2020.\nJPMorgan announced in May of this year that it would revise its lending portfolio to be more sustainable.\n\u201cWe are the first large US bank to lay out concrete targets that help meet the goals of Paris \u2013 climate change is a critical issue and we want to be part of the solution, advancing sustainable and inclusive growth,\u201d a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement.\nBut JP Morgan\u2019s benchmark is built around carbon intensity. The bank could finance more drilling without breaking its pledge.\nThe bank wants oil and gas companies to cut their operations emissions intensity 35%. It\u2019s asking for much less from their oil and gas products \u2013 like natural gas for electricity and oil that is turned into gasoline for vehicles. For those, the bank wants a 15% reduction in intensity by 2030.\nJPMorgan has said it will \u201cwork with clients to address end-use emissions, including by shifting to lower-carbon fuels and exploring other business diversification strategies.\u201d\nThe main lower-carbon fuel is natural gas. If a fossil fuel company increases natural gas production enough, it could offset its emissions progress. It could keep its intensity metric lower while still increasing its overall emissions.\n\u201cThey really took a page out of the oil industry book, when it comes to talking about their goals,\u201d said Jackie Fielder, digital and communications coordinator at Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition committed to ending the financing of fossil fuel companies.\n\u201cThey talked in terms of carbon intensity. So that\u2019s completely compatible with increased emissions.\u201d\nOn the ground, JP Morgan\u2019s financing has powered some of the most controversial fossil fuel projects. It funded TC Energy\u2019s Coastal GasLink, a fracked-gas pipeline that in 2020 leaked in Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en Territory. It also financed Cheniere\u2019s Corpus Christi natural gas export facility, as well as Enbridge, which is building the Line 3 pipeline.\nA JP Morgan spokesperson said the bank focuses on helping clients \u201ctransition to the low-carbon world\u201d, and supports climate policies like a carbon tax. But, the spokesperson added, the bank believes the world still needs oil and gas.\n\u201cThe solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels,\u201d the bank\u2019s spokesperson said.\n*Sunrise Project is a Floodlight supporter.",

Plus, Californians flock to see \u2018corpse plant\u2019\nGood morning.\nA high-profile federal criminal investigation into Rudy Giuliani has zeroed in on evidence that in spring 2019 three Ukrainian government prosecutors agreed to award contracts valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to the former New York mayor and two other US attorneys as a way to gain political and personal influence with the Trump administration.\nInvestigators believe Giuliani, Victoria Toensing and Joe DiGenova probably violated federal transparency laws that require Americans working for foreign governments to register as foreign agents with the US justice department.\nWhat evidence do the prosecutors have? They have compiled a list of more than two dozen specific acts by Giuliani, Toesning and DiGenova as to how to advance the personal and political interests of a group of Ukrainian prosecutors.\nHow does this relate to the campaign against Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter? They have also uncovered extensive, detailed plans devised by one Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, and approved by Giuliani, to promote an investigation into Hunter in Ukraine in order to help boost Donald Trump\u2019s chances of re-election.\nLess than a year after taking control of the White House and Congress, Democrats were reeling on Wednesday from a shocking defeat in Virginia and a tight race for governor in New Jersey as Joe Biden\u2019s popularity sinks and his domestic agenda hangs in the balance.\nIn Virginia, a state that had shifted sharply left over the past decade and that Biden won by 10 points in 2020, the Republican Glenn Youngkin, a political newcomer, defeated the Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor of the state. And in New Jersey the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, managed only a narrow victory over the Republican Jack Ciattarelli, an unexpected turn of events in a state that is even more reliably Democratic.\nTuesday\u2019s elections were the first major test of the national mood since Biden took office in January, and the results were deeply disappointing for the president and his party as they try to keep control of wafer-thin majorities in Congress.\nHow unpopular is Biden at the moment? Biden\u2019s poll numbers have slumped to near-historic lows. In mid-August, voters approved of the president by a margin of 50 to 43.8%. Today they disapprove of him by a margin of 51.1 to 43.2%.\nWhy is this? Months of infighting among Democrats over his nearly $3tn legislative agenda on Capitol Hill, a devastating evacuation from Afghanistan and the ever-present threat of coronavirus are all thought to have contributed to his lack of popularity.\nA US drone strike in Kabul in August that killed 10 Afghan civilians was a tragic mistake but did not violate any laws, a Pentagon inspector general has said after an investigation.\nThree adults, including a man who worked for a US aid group, and seven children were killed in the 29 August operation. The target is believed to have been a home and a vehicle occupied by Islamic State militants.\n\u201cThe investigation found no violation of law, including the law of war. Execution errors combined with confirmation bias and communication breakdowns led to regrettable civilian casualties,\u201d Lt Gen Sami Said, the inspector general for the US air force, said in a report.\nWhat else did Said say? He told reporters the attack was \u201can honest mistake\u201d and not criminal conduct, random conduct or negligence.\nWhy did those responsible carry out the strike? The people directly involved in the strike genuinely believed \u201cthat they were targeting an imminent strike\u201d, Said said.\nThe scale of climate misinformation on Facebook is \u201cstaggering\u201d and \u201cincreasing quite substantially\u201d, an analysis of hundreds of thousands of posts has found.\nA report released on Thursday by the Real Facebook Oversight Board, an independent watchdog group, and the environmental nonprofit Stop Funding Heat, analyzed a dataset of more than 195 Facebook pages and groups. Researchers found an estimated 818,000 posts downplaying or denying the climate crisis, which received a combined 1.36m views a day.\nThe study\u2019s release coincides with the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The report urges governments to seriously consider the role of climate misinformation on social media in derailing the battle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers said: \u201cFacebook is among the world\u2019s biggest purveyors of climate disinformation.\u201d\nWhat did Facebook say about the findings? Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it continues to counteract the spread of misinformation by flagging climate information and referring users to its Climate Change Science Center.\nCalifornians are rushing to see a rare \u201ccorpse plant\u201d that blooms for just 48 hours. The bloom of the Sumatran flower \u2013 nicknamed for its smell like a dead body \u2013 is drawing huge crowds to a southern California botanical garden.\nA lawyer for the armorer who oversaw weapons used on the Rust movie set has suggested sabotage. The attorney for Hannah Gutierrez said someone could have deliberately put a live round into the gun used by Alec Baldwin when he accidentally shot dead a cinematographer.\nA Georgia judge has acknowledged there appeared to be \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d after a nearly all-white jury was selected for the trial of three white men accused of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, but has seated the jury nonetheless.\nThe Biden administration has placed NSO Group on a US blacklist after it determined that the Israeli spyware maker had acted contrary national security interests of the US. The decision against the company at heart of the Pegasus project reflects deep concern about the impact of spyware on US national security interests.\nA \u201cgiant windowless prison\u201d, \u201cDormzilla\u201d, a \u201ctorture experiment\u201d: the internet has been weighing in on the construction plan for a student dormitory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, since an architect\u2019s resignation letter went viral. The project has sparked fierce debate about what people should, or can, endure in the name of efficiency. The proposed dormitory would be the world\u2019s densest, a feat achieved by packing 4,500 students into a 11-story building whose bedrooms are mostly devoid of windows.\nThere have been reams written about The Sopranos, often rated as the greatest TV series of all time. It won Michael Imperioli an Emmy in 2004, one of 21 the show picked up. After the late James Gandolfini \u2013 who played Tony Soprano \u2013 Imperioli is probably the show\u2019s most recognisable star. Even though the show ended nearly 15 years ago, it\u2019s more popular now than ever. HBO reported a 200% surge in viewers last year in the US. And on the back of that, Imperioli and his fellow cast member Steve Schirripa have written a book, which they are billing as the definitive oral history of The Sopranos.\nJPMorgan Chase won glowing headlines last year when it announced a commitment to counter the climate crisis. The bank waited months to detail its plans, and in May it said it would not press oil companies to lower their emissions. Instead, it would encourage them to become more efficient, focusing on their \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d. That metric has become a favorite of banks, oil companies and other big businesses. But \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d pledges have given companies a framework to keep investing in dirty fuels.\nWant more environmental stories delivered to your inbox?

An incredible signing.\nMatt Walsham down the road already had a BBC Micro. Matchday was the first \u2013 with line-drawn graphics and clunky gameplay.

We begin the season after Tottenham have lost in the Champions League final.\nLuke is very personable and his relationship with his Spurs-supporting dad, who joins us on this journey, is charming. They are either full screen or in a little box with the game taking centre stage. He explains he\u2019s going to sell Harry Kane, which he does, for \u00a386m to Manchester City, and offloads a few more. Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez arrive in Kane\u2019s place along with some supporting actors in defence and midfield.\nAnd then he just presses a button and the season is over. He gets the computer to play the whole thing \u2013 we don\u2019t see any games. Spurs have finished fourth and won the Europa League. Is an e-trophy really an e-trophy if no one was there to see it?

The property is marketed online for rentals, reportedly for as much as \u00a325,000 a week\nThe register said: \u201cThe prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021 stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain, which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared.\u201d\nNo 10 has previously declined to answer questions about whether there could be a perceived conflict of interest, given that Johnson awarded Goldsmith a peerage after the latter lost his Richmond seat in 2019, and allowed him to keep his job as an environment minister.\nAfter the holiday, the Guardian revealed that documents indicated that the luxurious Goldsmith family villa had been held by an opaque offshore structure based in multiple tax havens.\nThe papers suggested the minister and his family may have owned the property through a Maltese company held by companies in the Turks and Caicos Islands and administered by a wealth-planning firm based in Switzerland.\nIn a statement at the time, Goldsmith\u2019s spokesperson said he had \u201cfollowed the ministerial interests process set out in the ministerial code\u201d. She added: \u201cHis interests have been reviewed by the Cabinet Office and the prime minister\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial interests. Other relevant interests have correctly been reported in line with the House of Lords\u2019 code of conduct.\u201d\nJohnson took the holiday during an unusual recess from parliament after party conference season, and No 10 had to defend his decision to go abroad during the energy and supply chain crisis.\nAt the time, No 10 refused to confirm that Goldsmith was covering the cost of the holiday in Marbella or say how the prime minister had travelled to Spain with his family.",

They said the babies had \u201cbeen injected with heroin to make them sleep\u201d. Test results confirmed it and the children were taken into care.\nA newly published child safeguarding practice review written by an independent adviser, Amanda Clarke, reveals that all four children were victims of chronic neglect for a number of years and there was \u201csignificant multi-agency involvement\u201d with the family.\n\u201cIt was suspected that both parents prioritised their substance use over the care of their children, both in terms of their availability to provide care and emotional warmth, and in their use of financial resources, which resulted in times when the children did not have adequate food or warmth.\u201d\nEven so, the children remained mostly in the parents\u2019 care until the heroin incident.\nThe review outlines a number of incidents including a violent domestic dispute in 2018 when both parents sustained serious injuries and police were called. On another occasion the father went to the school of the nine-year-old \u201csignificantly under the influence\u201d.\nThe children went to live with the maternal grandmother but concerns about her mental health and ability to provide basic care meant they were returned to the parents.\nThe 16-year-old, who refused to go back, said her mother had overdosed and she couldn\u2019t sleep fearing \u201cshe would wake up to find both parents dead and have to care for her siblings\u201d.\nThe report describes how the two-year-old, after being taken in to care, would scream regularly and for long periods, and was prone to \u201ctaking food and hiding food to gorge eat, and presenting as frightened that food would be taken away\u201d.\nThe youngest child\u2019s behaviour in care was described as similar, along with an additional extreme fear of water and bathtimes.\nClarke\u2019s review makes a number of conclusions and recommendations and finds that there was only limited evidence that the children were asked about their wishes or feelings.\nThe review says social care professionals allocated to the case often changed \u201cand there was little opportunity for trusting relationships to be built\u201d with the children.\nA central lesson was the need for social workers to put themselves in the child\u2019s shoes. Often the complexity of a family\u2019s life and the large amount of information could get in the way of identifying risk and that was the case here, Clarke concluded.\nThe report says the phrase \u201csafeguarding is everyone\u2019s business\u201d has been a well-used slogan in the sector for a number of years but should now evolve into \u201csafeguarding everyone is everyone\u2019s business\u201d.\nClarke concluded: \u201cAn essential question to remember for all professionals supporting families, however large or small their part may be in the multi-agency response, is: what is life like for the children living in these circumstances?\u201d That did not always happen in this case, the review says.",

The drug will initially be given to patients through a national study run by the NHS.\nProf Peter Horby, the co-leader of the groundbreaking Recovery trial of Covid treatments at the University of Oxford, said the decision by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was very welcome and amounted to a watershed moment in tackling the pandemic.\nThe MHRA said on Thursday that the drug developed by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD), was safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with mild to moderate Covid who are at increased risk of developing severe disease.\nThe health secretary, Sajid Javid, said the decision marked a \u201chistoric day\u201d, adding \u201cthe UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for Covid-19. This will be a gamechanger for the most vulnerable and the immunosuppressed, who will soon be able to receive the groundbreaking treatment.\u201d\nNo 10 announced a deal last month to buy 480,000 doses of molnupiravir, also known as Lagevrio, after a clinical trial in the US showed a five-day course of the pills halved the risk of hospitalisation or death for at-risk patients. The first delivery is expected no earlier than mid-November.\nMolnupiravir interferes with the virus\u2019s ability to replicate, meaning it is less able to multiply and reach high enough levels in the respiratory system to cause severe disease. Because the drug is most effective when given in the early stages of infection, the MHRA recommends it is used as soon as possible after a positive test for Covid and within five days of symptoms appearing.\nThe drug is approved for people with mild to moderate Covid and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, or being older than 60.\n\u201cFollowing a rigorous review of the data by our expert scientists and clinicians, we are satisfied that Lagevrio [molnupiravir] is safe and effective for those at risk of developing severe Covid-19 disease and have granted its approval,\u201d said Dr June Raine, the MHRA chief executive.\n\u201cLagevrio is another therapeutic to add to our armoury against Covid-19. It is also the world\u2019s first approved antiviral for this disease that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously. This is important because it means it can be administered outside of a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage.\u201d\nHorby said: \u2018\u2018The approval of an oral antiviral for Covid-19 is a major scientific achievement and, to me, feels like a bit of a watershed. The MHRA are to be commended for, once again, moving very quickly to ensure the UK population gets access to drugs with proven benefit.\n\u201cWe do, however, have some more work to do, such as ensuring access and affordability, avoiding drug resistance, and seeing if this drug can benefit other patient groups such as those hospitalised with Covid-19.\u201d",

The club will hold an unscheduled board meeting on Friday to discuss the fallout.\nOn Wednesday night Gary Ballance admitted he had used racial slurs towards Rafiq when they were teammates at Yorkshire. Ballance claimed in a lengthy statement he had once enjoyed a deep friendship with Rafiq but that both men \u201csaid things privately to each other which were not acceptable\u201d and offered remorse for his part of those exchanges.\nThe independent panel which looked at 43 allegations in total from Rafiq determined those racial slurs from Ballance were delivered \u201cin the spirit of friendly banter\u201d and did not uphold that allegation \u2013 a conclusion which has caused a wave of condemnation from prominent politicians and campaign groups and kicked off an exodus of Yorkshire\u2019s commercial partners.\nRafiq says that despite the week\u2019s events, criticism is still coming his way. He tweeted on Thursday: \u201cWe wonder why people don\u2019t come forward. Even after everything that is out there, there seems to be personal attacks coming. What a sad state of affairs.\u201d\nRafiq will appear before MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee later this month and wrote in an earlier tweet on Thursday: \u201cI wanted to stress this is not really about the words of certain individuals. This is about institutional racism and abject failures to act by numerous leaders at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and in the wider game. The sport I love and my club desperately need reform and cultural change.\u201d\nYorkshire CCC has been criticised for its failure to release the report of its investigation into Rafiq\u2019s allegations. In September it published a summary of the findings of the report.\nWhile county chairman Roger Hutton said at that time there was \u201cno question\u201d Rafiq had been the victim of racial harassment and bullying over the course of two spells at Yorkshire, the club announced last week that no individual would face disciplinary action as a consequence.\nYorkshire shirt sponsor Anchor Butter severed ties with the club over their handling of the matter and Emerald Group Publishing has withdrawn its naming rights of Headingley Stadium among other tie-ins with the team. Yorkshire Tea has dissolved its association with immediate effect and Tetley\u2019s Beer has confirmed it will back out at the end of its current deal.\nIn response to a suggestion by the finance and cricket journalist Isabelle Westbury in a tweet that \u201cit [might] be more constructive to see high-profile sponsors of Yorkshire agreeing to stay on a number of strict conditions\u201d, Rafiq stated: \u201cRespect you & where you are coming from but [the sponsors] have stood by the club for 14 months hoping they would do the right thing but the club & its leaders are just not interested They still don\u2019t think anything wrong has happened.\u201d\nThe former England captain Nasser Hussain fears Yorkshire\u2019s handling of Rafiq\u2019s racism claims will send a message to players in their academy that racial discrimination can be passed off as banter.\nHussain said on Sky Sports: \u201cThey messed it up first time when it actually happened because no one had the guts to stand up and say: \u2018No, we are not doing that in this dressing room.\u2019 They next messed it up for years after that by not picking out people who used that terminology and they are still messing it up now when they had the option to say: \u2018We have changed, we will not accept this sort of behaviour\u2019. So they continue to mess it up.\n\u201cAlmost by Yorkshire saying it is just banter, they are sending a message through all their age groups that it is OK to say \u2018you lot\u2019 and \u2018that corner shop must belong to your uncle\u2019 and things like that. They are sending a message that this sort of mickey taking is absolutely fine and it\u2019s not.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a prominent group of the county\u2019s politicians \u2013 including the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves \u2013 wrote to the England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison demanding \u201can immediate, comprehensive and independent inquiry into YCCC\u2019s handling of the original allegations and the subsequent investigation\u201d.",

The dispute revolved around the NHL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement giving teams the final say over the treatment of injuries.\nThough Eichel remains sidelined, the Golden Knights addressed their biggest long-term need in landing a top-line center by trading forward Alex Tuch, rookie center Peyton Krebs and two draft picks to the Sabres.\nEichel is expected to have the disk replacement surgery he preferred, though the recovery timetable means he\u2019ll likely miss most if not all of the remainder of the season. The length of the dispute also essentially eliminates Eichel\u2019s chance to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing in February.\nSabres doctors favored Eichel having fusion surgery and opposed the disk replacement procedure because it has never been conducted on an NHL player.\nEichel was the Sabres\u2019 highest-paid player and is in the fourth year of an eight-year, $80m contract. He topped 20 goals in each of his first five seasons and enjoyed a breakout year in 2019-20, when he had a career-best 36 goals in 68 games before the season was abruptly canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nOverall, he finishes with 139 goals and 355 points in 375 career games with Buffalo.\nBuffalo acquired a top-10 protected first-round pick in the 2022 draft and a 2023 second-round selection. Vegas also acquired a 2023 third-round pick.\nThe feud became public in May, when Eichel revealed what he called \u201ca disconnect\u201d with the team over treating the injury, and he questioned his future with a franchise that once regarded him as a key building block after selecting him with the No 2 pick in the 2015 draft.\nThe dispute escalated over the summer, with Eichel changing agents in August in a bid to spur a trade. In September, the Sabres stripped Eichel of his captaincy before the start of training camp.\nIn recent weeks, Eichel\u2019s camp began threatening to file a grievance through the NHL Players\u2019 Association, questioning whether Sabres doctors followed the collective bargaining agreement in giving his option of surgery serious consideration.\nThe standoff drew the attention of the highest levels of the league, with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman calling it \u201ca terrible situation\u201d, without fixing blame on either side.",

The number of rape offences in the year ending June 2021 was the highest ever recorded annual figure to date (61,158 offences),\u201d said a report published on Thursday.\nThe ONS said the record was driven by a large increase between April and June, in which there were 17,300 rape offences, compared with a quarterly average of between 12,000 and 15,000.\nThe increase may reflect \u201ca number of factors, including the impact of high-profile cases and campaigns on victims\u2019 willingness to report incidents\u201d, rather than solely an increase in the number of rapes committed.\nThe rape and murder of Sarah Everard in March prompted a national debate over women\u2019s safety, sexual violence and the response of police and prosecutors.\nNick Stripe, the head of crime statistics at the ONS, said some caution should be exercised when interpreting the figures.\n\u201cPrior to the pandemic, the number of police-recorded sexual offences was well below the number of victims estimated by the Crime Survey for England & Wales, with fewer than one in six victims of rape or assault by penetration reporting the crime to the police.\n\u201cThe rise could be due to an increase in victim reporting as lockdowns eased, an increase in the number of victims, or to an increase in victims\u2019 willingness to report incidents, potentially as a result of high-profile cases and campaigns in recent times,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nThe number of domestic abuse-related crimes also rose by 6% in the year, to almost 850,000 offences.\nThe ONS said under-reporting made it difficult to determine the true level of domestic abuse in England and Wales, but data from support services suggests it intensified during lockdown periods.\nOther crimes, such as theft, were reduced during periods of lockdown as social contact was limited and people stayed at home. But falls in the incidence of these crimes were offset by a large increase in fraud and computer misuse offences, driving an overall rise in crime over the course of the year.\nThe police also recorded 846,235 offences flagged as domestic abuse-related for the 12-month period, representing a 6% increase from 813,958 offences in the previous year. This included 687,328 offences of violence against the person labelled as domestic abuse-related, a 7% increase compared to the previous year.\nThe ONS said it was \u201cdifficult to determine\u201d the levels of domestic abuse in the country using police recorded data because of changes in the way the crimes are reported, so \u201cwe cannot conclude whether there has been an increase in the number of victims of domestic abuse\u201d. It added: \u201cData from victim services suggests that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified during periods of national lockdown and that victims faced difficulties in safely seeking support under these conditions.\u201d\nReports of fraud and hacking continued to rise \u2013 something the ONS previously suggested was due to criminals taking advantage of behavioural changes during the pandemic when many took to online shopping when there were restrictions on movement.\nIn the latest period Action Fraud, the national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre, reported a 36% rise in fraud offences. The data showed a 34% increase in \u201conline shopping and auctions\u201d fraud in the latest year (from 70,761 to 94,795 offences) and a 51% increase in \u201cfinancial investment fraud\u201d (from 14,685 to 22,200 offences), the ONS said.",

So there\u2019s a very simple explanation for what\u2019s going on.\n\u201cWe have many susceptible individuals, including in high-vaccinated countries, and this is leading to unpredictable explosive outbreaks of Covid-19. And that\u2019s not where we want to be right now.\u201d\nGermany reported a record-high number of Covid-19 cases on Thursday, with 33,949 infections in the past 24 hours compared to a previous high of 33,777 new cases in December 2020. The federal health minister, Jens Spahn, is to meet state health ministers to discuss how to limit the virus\u2019s spread before the winter.\nBulgaria and Romania, the two eastern EU countries with the bloc\u2019s lowest vaccination rates \u2013 25.5% and 37.2% of adults respectively \u2013 this week reported their highest daily Covid-19 death tolls since the beginning of the pandemic.\nAmong the countries with the highest numbers of new daily infections, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are facing critical overloads on their health care systems and tightening measures, with Latvia imposing a nightly curfew, barring all public and most private gatherings, and limiting shopping to all but essential goods.\nEstonia closed all public events and gatherings to non-vaccinated people and required those who have had both jabs to wear masks indoors, while several Russian regions said they could impose additional restrictions to fight a rise in cases that has already prompted Moscow to reimpose a partial lockdown nationwide.\nFacing a dramatic increase in infections, the Dutch government will reintroduce tougher social restrictions from 6 November, making mask-wearing obligatory in public spaces such as shops and Covid passes mandatory for museums and other public spaces.\nThe move follows neighbouring Belgium\u2019s decision to tighten its restrictions from Monday after case numbers hit their highest level in a year, reimposing mask-wearing indoors and encouraging people to work remotely.\nKluge said case numbers in Europe and central Asia had risen by 6% in a week, and deaths by 12%, with new daily infections surging by 55% over the past month. Europe and central Asia combined now accounted for 59% of all confirmed cases globally and nearly half of all deaths.\nInsufficient vaccination coverage and the relaxation of public health and social measures were to blame, he said. With a billion doses now administered in Europe and central Asia, vaccines were saving \u201cthousands upon thousands\u201d of lives.\nBut while 70% of people in some countries are fully vaccinated, barely 10% are in others. \u201cWhere vaccine uptake is low, in many countries in the Baltics, central and eastern Europe and the Balkans, hospital admission rates are high,\u201d he said.\nKluge said the most alarming development was the rapid increase in infections and deaths in older population groups, with hospital admission rates more than doubling in a week and 75% of fatal cases now occurring in people aged 65 years and over.\n\u201cIf we stay on this trajectory, we could see another half a million Covid-19 deaths in Europe and central Asia by the first of February next year, and 43 countries in our region will face high to extreme stress on hospital beds,\u201d he said.\nAuthorities must accelerate vaccine rollouts, including booster shots for at-risk groups, he said: \u201cMost people hospitalised and dying from Covid-19 today are not fully vaccinated.\u201d\nBut public health measures such as test and trace, and social measures such as mask-wearing and distancing, were equally vital, he said, adding that WHO estimates suggested that 95% universal mask use in Europe and central Asia \u201ccould save up to 188,000 of the half a million lives we may lose\u201d before February.\nWhen applied \u201ccorrectly and consistently\u201d, preventive measures \u201callow us to go on with our lives, not the opposite\u201d, Kluge said. \u201cPreventive measures do not deprive people of their freedom, they ensure it.\u201d Covid passes showing proof of vaccination should be viewed as \u201ca collective tool towards individual liberty\u201d.",

However our scale, advanced cost saving programme, logistics operations and strong supplier relationships put us in a good position as we head into Christmas.\u201d\nSainsbury\u2019s said it had largely shrugged off the problems with supplies that have dogged the UK industry \u2013 ranging from congestion at ports and shortages of shipping containers to staffing problems in factories and on farms \u2013 in the first half of the year with a return to profit and rise in sales as families bought more petrol and clothing and continued to cook more meals at home.\nTotal sales, including fuel, rose 6% in the six months to 18 September, including a 0.8% rise in groceries despite issues with importing foods caused by a mix of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.\nClothing sales rose by one-third and fuel sales were up almost 63% as families returned to school and workplaces after last year\u2019s lockdowns.

In a statement to the Guardian, Cade said she had only attacked \u201cpersonas\u201d, not people, and said Lily Cade was also a persona.\nAn update added to the BBC article on Thursday reads: \u201cWe have updated this article, published last week, to remove a contribution from one individual in light of comments she has published on blog posts in recent days, which we have been able to verify.\n\u201cWe acknowledge that an admission of inappropriate behaviour by the same contributor should have been included in the original article.\u201d\nThe article was published from the BBC\u2019s Nottingham office. Despite pushback from some members of staff in the BBC\u2019s London headquarters, the regional office has its own editorial structure and ability to publish on the main BBC website.\nOne BBC source said on Monday that the broadcaster had received 4,819 complaints about the article \u2013 which had been a subject of debate within the organisation for some time \u2013 but a further 5,520 people wrote in to note their approval of the piece.\nOn Wednesday Chelsea Poe, a trans porn performer, said she had told the BBC journalist behind the article that Cade had been accused of sexual misconduct and was no longer working in the porn industry, but said she had not been quoted in the piece. A source at the BBC said the journalist behind the story had spoken to Poe but an editorial judgment was made not to quote her because the general conversation was deemed not relevant to the piece.\nOn Monday the BBC said it stood by the article about the experience of some lesbians, adding it had been subject to a rigorous editing process and that it met its editorial guidelines, but by Wednesday executives were understood to be looking into issues raised since then, with the decision to edit the piece taken on Thursday. A spokesperson for the BBC said the article was \u201can important piece of journalism that raises issues that should be discussed\u201d.\nCritics of the 4,000-word article focused on its use of a self-selecting survey of 80 people produced by a small campaign group that has said trans activism within the LGBTQ+ movement is erasing lesbians.\nThe corporation argued that the lack of data on whether lesbians are being pressured to have sex with trans women justified the caveated inclusion of the group\u2019s survey, which was one part of a longer piece.\nThe article stated that several \u201chigh-profile trans women who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships\u201d did not want to be included in the piece, but said it had reflected a range of views, including those given by trans women on YouTube.\nBut further controversy emerged on Wednesday after Poe published a podcast in which she said she had been interviewed by the BBC journalist behind the article at the start of 2021. She said she told the journalist that Cade was no longer working in the industry \u201cdue to consent issues\u201d, but her interview had not been used in the published article. The Guardian approached Poe for comment but she had not responded prior to publication.\nCade acknowledged allegations made against her and apologised in 2017, in comments published on the website of the porn blogger trpwl. In an email to the Guardian she claimed that while sex without explicit verbal consent was common in the porn community, she thought the encounters had been consensual and had stopped working after they were made.\nLui Asquith, the director of legal and policy for Mermaids, said the BBC article had caused distress in the trans community, and that the charity questioned its impartiality. \u201cThis article contributes to the irrational fearmongering aimed at trans women, who have been relentlessly and systematically targeted by the media in recent years. We should all expect better of our national broadcaster,\u201d Asquith said.",

Obviously that won\u2019t be possible, so what will happen instead is that we end up on a temperature trajectory associated with a higher carbon budget: 2C, 3C or even higher, with catastrophic consequences.\nMany of the conventional 1.5C scenarios depend on negative emissions in the second half of the 21st century. In other words, we would overshoot our carbon budget and then have to remove the excess carbon from the atmosphere artificially. On the graph, this would be trending the emissions line underneath the X-axis into negative territory.\nThis is conceptually possible in that technologies already exist to do this, such as chemical scrubbers that dissolve CO2 and pump it underground, or power stations burning biomass that sequester their CO2.\nHowever, using either of these techniques to get rid of CO2 on the scale required \u2013 which would be potentially hundreds of billions of tonnes \u2013 is pretty implausible. It would be like reversing the global oil and gas industry for a few decades, and putting all the carbon we drilled out back in the ground.\nThis is a common argument, and it makes some sense. For example, if we had grid-scale electricity storage options or cheap advanced nuclear fission \u2013 both of which are in development but still some way off \u2013 we would potentially be able to substitute clean energy sources for fossil fuels in a way that does not reduce prosperity, and even contributes to economic growth as new markets open up.\nThe problem is the carbon budget: every year of high fossil fuel emissions \u2013 currently at 35bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year \u2013 steadily eats away at the remaining carbon budget. At current emission rates our whole 1.5C carbon budget will be gone in about eight years, as the graph shows.\nIt would certainly help. We need to throw every clean energy technology we can at the problem given the urgency of the climate crisis. But the intermittency issue with renewables has not yet been solved, as the wind energy lull over the past few months in Europe \u2013 when coal-fired power plants had to be turned back on \u2013 demonstrated.\nThis has led to a renaissance of support for nuclear in the UK, France and many other countries. There are also some sectors of the economy that can\u2019t be decarbonised even with clean electricity: think cement-making, chemicals, steel, fertilisers or long-distance transport. These will most likely need hydrogen \u2013 but in all these sectors clean hydrogen-based options are still in their infancy.\nThe carbon budget for 2C is larger, but will still be used up entirely within 25 years at current rates of emissions. Moreover, accepting that 1.5C is no longer possible means accepting the increased climate damages that ensue. These have been laid out for us by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nFor example, at 2C as compared with 1.5C, an additional 1.7 billion people would be exposed to severe heatwaves, 420 million to extreme heatwaves and 65 million more to deadly heat. The world\u2019s natural life would be devastated, and coral reefs virtually eliminated from the tropical oceans.\nRates of sea level rise would accelerate, displacing an additional 10 million people and putting 136 coastal megacities at increased risk of flooding.\nOne of the key demands of the countries most at risk \u2013 represented by the 48-member Climate Vulnerable Forum \u2013 is for an emergency pact to be agreed at Glasgow to keep the 1.5C goal alive. For some of these countries \u2013 such as the Maldives and Bangladesh \u2013 this is not so much a matter of policy as a matter of national survival.\n The graphic in this article was corrected on 5 November 2021: the original graphic incorrectly had annual emissions of carbon dioxide ranging up to 4bn metric tonnes, instead of 40bn metric tonnes.",

        "content": "Government introduced bill in October, prompting fears it could be pushed through before the 2022 election with support from One Nation\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s voter ID bill could be challenged in court as a disproportionate measure that excludes people from voting, constitutional law expert Prof Anne Twomey has warned.\nThe Morrison government insists nobody would be completely prevented from voting but Twomey argues the proposed legislation could still be struck down for the \u201cimposition of additional administrative burdens that make it more difficult to vote or discourage people from voting\u201d.\nIn addition to concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on groups including Indigenous Australians and people experiencing homelessness, Labor is warning the bill \u201cis a recipe for disaster on polling day\u201d because it could add to queues and be inconsistently applied.\nThe voter integrity bill would see voters asked to show a wide range of photo or non-photo identification in order to vote. People could cast a declaration vote \u2013 after providing their date of birth and signature \u2013 if they were unable to show any ID.\nThe government introduced the bill in the October sittings of parliament, prompting fears it could be pushed through ahead of the 2022 election with the support of One Nation, which has claimed credit for it, and Centre Alliance, which has supported it in principle but is yet to decide its position.\nIn September, Twomey made a submission to a Senate inquiry considering a similar One Nation bill, noting that voter ID requirements had a \u201clong history in other countries \u2026 to prevent or deter certain groups in society from voting\u201d.\nTwomey warned that \u2013 even with measures in place for itinerant, disadvantaged and Indigenous electors in remote areas \u2013 \u201cthe additional procedural burden, the effort required, the confusion that it can create and the message that it sends of being \u2018suspect\u2019 or unwanted, may be enough to suppress the vote\u201d.\nTwomey told Guardian Australia this week the constitutional issues with the government bill were \u201clikely to be similar\u201d.\nCourts would determine the bill\u2019s \u201cburden\u201d on the capacity to vote, including \u201ccomplete exclusion from voting\u201d and \u201cadditional administrative burdens\u201d, then assess whether it was \u201creasonably necessary or proportionate to achieving a legitimate end\u201d, she said.\nTwomey said \u201cthe key will be the extent of the burden\u201d and any challenge would need evidence to show \u201ceven if it doesn\u2019t legally exclude anyone, does it have the effect of suppressing the vote\u201d.\nTwomey said if a court accepted there was a \u201cburden \u2026 then there is a good argument that it would fall over at the proportionality level\u201d as it was \u201clikely that it is not reasonably necessary or proportionate\u201d.\nBut the University of Queensland professor Graeme Orr said it would be \u201cprocedurally hard\u201d to challenge the law, as evidence of its impact would be clearest only after polling day.\nOrr said the law was \u201centirely unnecessary\u201d and it was a \u201cstupid time\u201d to introduce it before an election in which Covid-19 would be circulating in the community.\nNevertheless, he said it was \u201cvery hard to imagine\u201d a challenge would succeed \u201cunless [the law is] tweaked in future or there is some evidence of its disparate impact\u201d.\n\u201cHow do you get someone to say \u2018I don\u2019t have ID so I couldn\u2019t vote\u2019 \u2013 the answer is get some ID,\u201d he said, noting the \u201cwide array\u201d of documents which would be accepted.\nThe shadow special minister of state, Don Farrell, said voter ID would work out \u201ccatastrophically\u201d as it was \u201cthe first time in 120 years\u201d it would be implemented \u2013 and just months out from a federal election which would require social distancing due to Covid.\nFarrell said the requirement could double the time taken to be marked off the roll and created \u201cenormous\u201d potential for conflict between poll workers and voters.\nLabor\u2019s shadow multicultural affairs minister, Andrew Giles, has questioned whether the laws will disadvantage culturally and linguistically diverse people because of discrepancies in spelling between the electoral roll and their ID documents, and how much discretion polling officers will have in such cases.\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no evidence of voter fraud in Australia, there\u2019s a plethora of evidence of right-wing voices wanting to restrict the franchise, especially in respect of First Nations people and multicultural communities,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\nGiles, a former chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, said the Australian Electoral Commission had told the committee that \u201cthe instance of multiple voting for the House of Representatives was just 0.03%\u201d.\nParliamentary library advice, prepared for Labor, concluded that studies of US voter ID laws found \u201cno detectable effect on turnout\u201d but noted the laws are \u201crelatively new\u201d and effects may emerge over time.\nThe advice recognised that \u201cnot all Australians are equally likely to have access to common forms of identification\u201d.\nBut it concluded that there was \u201cno neat summary of who has what ID, however there seems to be little suggestion that there is any particular group of Australians who have no access to any form of ID document\u201d.",

But while no one was paying attention, plenty was happening behind the scenes, and this kid shot up.\nSo much so that in Lonely Planet\u2019s list of 10 regions to visit in 2022, the Scenic Rim rubs shoulders with the likes of Burgundy, Vancouver and Puerto Rico. Older and younger Queensland siblings (and smug Aussie cousins) \u2026 eat your heart out.\nAt about 10 times the size of the Gold Coast, this rich, green, mountainous region is home to seven distinct areas \u2013 most with names just as picturesque as \u201cScenic Rim\u201d \u2013 and six national parks, including world-heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests. To cover the whole region and take part in activities, allow at least two days to visit.\nTabitha Bird, author of A Lifetime of Impossible Days and the Emporium of Imagination, lives on the western side of the region in a town called Boonah, which is also the setting for both of her books.\n\u201cI was writing my first book and when I came out here I realised it had no setting, and then I discovered this was the perfect place with its characters,\u201d she says. \u201cTowns like this attract a lot of quirky souls.\n\u201cMy second book has even more of the town featured in it and the locals love it. I often do things like a \u2018getting lost drive\u2019, the whole point of the drive is to get lost and discover the region.\nThe Scenic Rim was named by the Binna Burra tourism pioneer Arthur Groom in the mid-1900s. But Jenny Jenner, of Kalbar Sunflowers, says her visitors are still surprised by the area, a century later.\n\u201cPeople come out and say, \u2018Why haven\u2019t we found this place before now?\u2019 It\u2019s so scenic, tranquil and peaceful.\u201d\n\u201cVisitors love being able to do an experience \u2026 picking flowers; riding camels or climbing a mountain.\u201d\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given all the national parks, the Scenic Rim is home to hundreds of walking tracks.\nFor a challenging day hike, try the 7.4km Lower Portals Track in Mount Barney national park which leads to a deep freshwater pool. Cunningham\u2019s Gap in Main Range national park has a breezy 1.6km rainforest circuit; while O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Rainforest Retreat has a 800m elevated walkway through the rainforest canopy, which is free and open to the public.\nFor serious hikers, the 34.5km Scenic Rim Trail, which meanders through private property and Main Range national park, is a four-day hike with small, free campsites along the way. These should be booked before setting out, as spaces are limited.\nAfter devastating fires in 2019, the rainforest and tumbling valleys at Binna Burra Lodge are bursting back into green. Camping starts from $40 a night or, if you don\u2019t want to BYO, book one of their new safari tents, from $104. For quaint, historic cottages which tell a story, head to Mount Barney and Barney Creek Cottages (from $174) or to Rathdowney with its Tuckeroo Cottages and Gardens (from $128).\nThe agricultural region has farm gates and cellar doors galore. Lavender lovers will adore Mount Alford\u2019s Karoomba Vineyard and Lavender Farm which injects these fragrant flowers into its dishes. Nearby, sample the craft brews with quirky names like Shazza, Digga and Fat Man at Scenic Rim Brewery. Pick your potion at Mount Tamborine\u2019s Witches Falls Winery (the 2019 Prophecy Syrah runs out the door).\nFor something more eccentric, Harrisville\u2019s Summer Land Camels offers everything from rides to tastings \u2013 of fetta, halloumi, gelati and even a world-first vodka, all made from camel milk.\nThere\u2019s also a Scenic Rim Farm Box, an innovative idea born out of Covid-19 lockdowns to bring the country flavours to the city. Visit Kent\u2019s Lagoon shop, take some produce home, or even have it delivered.\nDuring sunflower season, in spring and summer, farm fields of gold burst into bloom. In 2021, drought-stricken Kalbar farmers, frustrated by strangers traipsing through their flower fields for Instagram opportunities, decided to launch a festival, and Kalbar Sunflowers blossomed.\nHead here for ticketed events including sunrise yoga, sunset dinners among the flowers, and pick-and-pay for bunches to take home. There are still photo opportunities \u2013 but these ones actually contribute to the local economy.",

        "content": "Finding could partly explain excess deaths seen in some communities in the UK and in south Asia\nScientists have identified a gene that doubles the risks of respiratory failure and death from Covid and could explain why people of south Asian heritage are more vulnerable to the disease.\nThe gene, which changes the way the lungs respond to infection, is the most important genetic risk factor identified so far and is carried by roughly 60% of people with south Asian backgrounds, compared with 15% of those with white European backgrounds. The finding could partly explain the excess deaths seen in some communities in the UK and the impact of Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent.\nProf James Davies, a geneticist at Oxford University\u2019s Radcliffe Department of Medicine and a senior author of the paper, said: \u201cThe genetic factor we have found explains why some people get very seriously ill after coronavirus infection \u2026 There\u2019s a single gene that confers quite a significant risk to people of south Asian background.\u201d\nOther scientists cautioned that the findings needed further confirmation and that genetic explanations should not overshadow other potentially more significant socioeconomic risk factors faced by ethnic minorities, including workplace exposure and unequal access to healthcare.\nThe study builds on previous work that identified a large chunk of DNA that appeared to influence how severely ill people become from Covid, based on genetic sequencing of tens of thousands of hospital patients in the UK and other countries. The latest study homed in on a single gene called LZTFL1, which was revealed to double the risk of respiratory failure and death.\nThe gene, which was previously unstudied, was found to act as a switch to turn on a crucial defence mechanism that prevents the Covid-19 virus from entering epithelial cells that line the lung. With the high-risk version of the gene, this response was blunted, meaning the virus would continue entering, infecting and damaging cells in the lung for a longer time period after exposure.\n\u201cAlthough we cannot change our genetics, our results show that the people with the higher-risk gene are likely to particularly benefit from vaccination,\u201d said Davies. \u201cSince the genetic signal affects the lung rather than the immune system, it means that the increased risk should be cancelled out by the vaccine.\u201d\nDavies said the findings also pointed to the possibility of new treatments targeting the lung cells\u2019 response. Most current treatments work by changing the way the immune system responds to the virus.\nThe findings could offer some explanation for why south Asian populations have been worst affected in the pandemic. In England\u2019s second wave, ONS data showed a risk of death three to four times higher for people of Bangladeshi backgrounds, 2.5 to three times higher for those of Pakistani backgrounds and 1.5 to two times higher for Indian backgrounds compared with the general population.\nUnlike the excess risk seen in black populations in the first wave, in south Asian groups there remained a significant unexplained risk once socio-economic factors were taken into account. \u201c[Genetic factors] would account for a large proportion of that,\u201d said Davies.\nRaghib Ali, of the University of Cambridge and an independent expert adviser on Covid-19 and ethnicity to the Race Disparity Unit in the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cThis is an important study which contributes to our ongoing efforts to understand the causes of the higher death rates from Covid in some ethnic groups and specifically as to why their outcomes or survival from Covid are worse after infection.\u201d\nHowever, others urged caution. Nazrul Islam, of Oxford University\u2019s Nuffield Department of Population Health, pointed out that some ethnicities are not well represented in the large genetic databases used to determine the prevalence of particular genes such as LZTHL1.\n\u201cIt provides an easy gateway for policymakers to say \u2018it\u2019s genetic, we can\u2019t do anything\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be very careful in analysing the data, questioning it repeatedly, and how we disseminate the findings. It has profound social issues.\u201d\nThe study is published in the journal Nature Genetics.",

The studio has yet to comment or confirm but sources claim that the reason is a kiss between Brian Tyree Henry\u2019s character and his on-screen husband, played by Haaz Sleiman.

He was investigated by a previous parliamentary commissioner for standards over a trip to the MTV Europe awards in Amsterdam in 2013 with his then girlfriend, a dominatrix sex worker.\nThe motion protecting Paterson was passed after Boris Johnson whipped Conservative MPs to support it \u2013 a highly unusual decision that Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer called \u201ccorrupt\u201d.\nAccording to Johnson\u2019s spokesperson, it was because he realised the plans for a committee set out in the Andrea Leadsom amendment he backed on Wednesday could not go ahead once Labour and the SNP had said they would boycott it.\nBut No 10 had also faced a significant backlash from Tory MPs about what they saw as the grubbiness of the manoeuvre, which conflated Paterson\u2019s position with broader issues about the system for policing MPs\u2019 behaviour.\nJohnson is also notoriously fixated on newspaper headlines, and on Thursday even the usually supportive Daily Mail called the move to protect Paterson \u201cshameless\u201d.\nHe announced on Thursday afternoon that he would now step down from parliament rather than face the potential humiliation of a byelection. The government had planned to table a motion early next week to unpick Wednesday\u2019s vote by reinstating Paterson\u2019s suspension and dissolving the mooted cross-party committee.\nIt was not planning to whip MPs, but given that Leadsom\u2019s amendment only passed with a narrow majority of 18 on a three-line Conservative whip, the motion undoing it would have been highly likely to pass.\nPaterson\u2019s 30-day suspension was long enough to have triggered the parliamentary recall process. That means if 10% of his constituents signed a petition, a byelection would have to be held.\nIn accordance with arcane parliamentary procedure, in order to surrender his seat on the green benches Paterson will have to be formally appointed to one of two historic non-jobs, crown steward and bailiff of either the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead.\nA byelection will then be scheduled and could take place within weeks. While he won the seat with a thumping majority of more than 22,000 in 2019, opposition parties are likely to campaign hard on the issue of sleaze.\nDates have not yet been set for two other byelections in Conservative-held seats, Southend West, whose MP David Amess was stabbed to death last month, and Old Bexley and Sidcup, the constituency of the former minister James Brokenshire, who recently died of cancer. Opposition parties have agreed not to stand candidates in Southend West out of respect for Amess\u2019s memory.\nThat is unclear. Announcing the government\u2019s dramatic change of position on Thursday morning, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government still believed there was a case for an appeals process to be introduced.\nHe conceded, however, that it had been wrong to link calls for reforms to the process to an individual case, and he promised to seek cross-party consensus on the way forward. He did not specify whether that would take place through the existing cross-party parliamentary standards committee, chaired by Chris Bryant, or in some other forum.\nThere is still likely to have to be a House of Commons vote to undo the results of Wednesday\u2019s motion.",

Hindus believe the city is the birthplace of the god Ram. In Amritsar, the Sikh Golden temple was enveloped in fairy lights.\nIn accordance with longstanding tradition to mark the festival, the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged sweets at the Tithwal crossing bridge on the Line of Control that divides the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir.\nThe Hindu festival represents new beginnings, but for many across India who lost their relatives and loved ones in the devastating Covid-19 second wave that swept through India in April it was the first Diwali without family members.\nIn Delhi, Shriya Chatterjee, 42, said the festival would not feel the same without her mother, who died in April from the virus. \u201cMy mum loved Diwali,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had all these traditions she would make us do every year and would boss us all around to make sure everything was perfect. It would drive me crazy but now this year I\u2019m making sure we celebrate as she would have. But I\u2019ve avoided parties and we are keeping it small, to be cautious because we know that Covid hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d\nEven though coronavirus cases in India are currently at some of their lowest levels since the pandemic began, with just over 12,000 new cases reported per day, zero Covid deaths in Delhi and the lowest active caseload in more than 250 days, there were concerns that complacency during the festival could lead to a new rise in cases, or even set in motion India\u2019s third wave.\nIn an address, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had urged people to take precautions during the celebrations and to be wary of Covid. However, Diwali parties were in full swing across Delhi in the days leading up to the festival, and markets in the capital and across the country were crammed with people squashed together, with little room for Covid precautions to be observed.\nFor Delhi residents, the morning of Diwali also brought with it the annual spectre of pollution, as air quality hit hazardous levels and a thick brown smog shrouded India\u2019s capital. Levels of PM2.5 \u2013 the smallest and most harmful particles polluting the air \u2013 peaked at an average of 389 on Thursday. The figure is more than 15 times higher than the safe limits set by the World Health Organization.\nThough polluting firecrackers were banned, and police seized four tonnes of them the night before Diwali, they could still be heard erupting across the city as night fell.",

        "content": "Problem is causing \u00a38bn a year in health damage but can be tackled cost-effectively, say scientists\nSixty per cent of the tiny particles polluting the air in the UK are from ammonia leaking from farms, according to research.\nThe ammonia is released from livestock manure and urine and the overuse of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. The gas drifts into cities and reacts with other air pollutants to form tiny particulate matter, called PM2.5, which is the deadliest form of air pollution.\nThese particles cause \u00a38bn a year in health damage in the UK, the scientists calculate. Globally, 39% of PM2.5 is derived from ammonia and results in $420bn (\u00a3320bn) of health damage, according to the study, published in the journal Science.\nAmmonia can be trapped on farms by sealing manure pits or injecting the waste under fields, and by the more efficient use of fertiliser. Such action saves \u00a323 in health damage for every \u00a31 spent in the UK, say the researchers, with the global cost benefit ratio being 4:1.\nIn the past, the burning of fossil fuels by vehicles and industry produced large amounts of PM2.5 but pollution controls have cut levels significantly in developed nations. However, ammonia emissions have barely fallen in the UK since 1980. This means agriculture is now responsible for a larger share of PM2.5 in the UK. Pollution from wood burning stoves has also risen in prominence.\nOther nitrogen compounds, called nitrogen oxides, are emitted by diesel vehicles and damage health in two ways: as irritant gases when first emitted and then by combining with ammonia to form PM2.5. Relatively little has been done to cut ammonia emissions, meaning there are simple policies that would be far more cost-effective in reducing PM2.5 levels than further technological measures to tackle nitrogen oxides from vehicles, the scientists say.\nCutting nitrogen pollution would also tackle the climate crisis, the pollution of rivers and seas, and soil acidification. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, causing about 6% of global heating and results mostly from the overuse of fertilisers.\nThe researchers presented a \u201c#Nitrogen4NetZero\u201d proposal at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow on Wednesday, which aims to ensure cutting nitrogen gases is included in climate targets. The 2019 Colombo declaration, led by Sri Lanka and backed by the UN Environment Programme, aims to cut nitrogen waste by half by 2030 and would save $100bn (\u00a375bn) a year in wasted fertiliser costs.\n\u201cThe way we use nitrogen is extremely inefficient. About 80% of the nitrogen resources [produced by humans] are lost into the environment,\u201d said Prof Mark Sutton of the UK\u2019s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, a co-author of the study.\nThe UK government is consulting on banning the use of urea in fertiliser, which emits much more ammonia than ammonium nitrate fertiliser. The Netherlands and Germany already require manure to be injected into fields rather than sprayed on the surface, but there is no such requirement in the UK. \u201cAny farmer that can smell their manure is losing that goodness,\u201d said Sutton.\nAir pollution causes at least 7 million premature deaths a year globally, making it a bigger killer than smoking, car crashes or HIV/Aids. Air pollution may be damaging every organ in the human body, according to a comprehensive global review in 2019.",

Most of them have since died.\nDocuments presented to the inquiry showed that in February 1986, Armour knew of two people who were infected with HIV, one in the UK and one in the Netherlands. In the case of the UK patient, Armour had known about the positive test in July 1985 but did not inform the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) until February 1986.\nAnother document implied that Armour did not start testing donors for HIV until February 1986. Nevertheless, the same month, the company sent a document to its sales reps saying: \u201cThe thousands of haemophiliacs who needed the life-saving treatment could be confident that they were receiving safe supplies.\u201d\nJenni Richards QC, the counsel to the inquiry, asked Bishop: \u201cOn what basis could you \u2026 confidently assert that the thousands of haemophiliacs who needed life-saving treatment were receiving safe supplies?\u201d\nBishop replied that it was \u201cbased on the evidence and the science available\u201d.\nThe inquiry was also shown a document sent by Armour UK to haemophilia centre directors in May 1983 which stated there was \u201clittle evidence\u201d to link its products with Aids. Asked if the wording was appropriate given concerns at the time, Bishop said it could have been improved by insertion of the word \u201cproven\u201d or \u201csubstantiated\u201d before \u201cevidence\u201d.\nAlso in 1983, Bishop sent a telex saying the DHSS would allow the company to \u201cdispose\u201d of Factor VIII manufactured before new safety measures had been introduced. He wrote that it was \u201cclearly vitally important\u201d to do this \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Asked by Richards if this meant he was keen to swiftly sell products made before the cut-off date because of a fear the DHSS might change its mind, Bishop replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, that would appear to be the indication.\u201d\nArmour\u2019s Factor VIII was withdrawn in October 1986, about a month after it emerged that two children with haemophilia at Birmingham children\u2019s hospital had been infected with HIV. Asked by Richards whether he accepted that it should have been withdrawn earlier and whether the company could have been more \u201copen and transparent\u201d, Bishop answered \u201cno\u201d to both.\nThe inquiry also heard that an internal Armour UK document acknowledged in 1981 that non-A, non-B Hepatitis (later named Hepatitis C) was the \u201cmost common form\u201d of the disease in \u201ccertain plasma derivatives\u201d and could cause chronic liver damage in up to 50% of patients whose infection was associated with blood transfusion or haemodialysis.",

        "content": "Shareholders will be reassured by group\u2019s decision to roll out full-fibre broadband alone \nHurrah, BT has seen the light. It has dropped the idea of forming a complicated joint venture to help fund the rollout of full-fibre broadband. That tentative proposal always smacked of a management obsessing about the short-term share price and fretting too much about possible takeover bids. Better to keep things simple by digging for Britain and getting the kit in ducts as quickly as possible.\nThe change of heart seems to have been prompted by the discovery that, when it concentrates on the job in hand, BT can take a chunk out of costs and thus finance the rollout to 25m premises by 2026 under its own steam. Average build costs have been cut by \u00a350 to \u00a3250-\u00a3300 per premises, which is a serious saving. The capital expenditure splurge, which had been making investors nervous, will now peak at \u00a34.8bn in 2023, rather than \u00a35bn.\nThat\u2019s a reassuring number for those shareholders who worry that fast-fibre riches are too distant to feel real. Spelling it out for them in hard numbers, the chief executive, Philip Jansen, promised \u201cexpansion of at least \u00a31.5bn in normalised free cashflow\u201d by the end of the decade compared to 2022.\nThe pitch, then, ought to be easy to understand: spend heavily for a few years, cement your leadership in a broadband market with monopolistic features and get rewarded later thanks to the \u201cfair bet\u201d terms secured with the regulator, Ofcom. Now that dividends are back, you also get paid to wait in the form of a 5% yield.\nThe complicating factor, potentially, is the presence of the French billionaire Patrick Drahi, whose Altice group bought a 12% stake in BT earlier this year. Drahi\u2019s intentions remain unclear, but one can probably say this: a takeover bid that relied on cutting investment by removing hard-to-reach premises would be a non-starter, politically speaking. The new national security and investment act could almost have been drafted with BT in mind.\nIn any case, the best defence against a takeover bid is a healthy share price. On that score, Jansen\u2019s more detailed financial projections prompted an 11% rise to 158p. There\u2019s still a way to go to reclaim the 200p seen in the excitement after Drahi\u2019s arrival, but the path looks clearer. Ignore distractions and hurry up with the fibre.\nMetro Bank is the challenger bank that ended up challenging the wealth of its backers. Once upon a time \u2013 actually as recently as three years ago \u2013 shares in the would-be banking revolutionary traded as high as \u00a340. After an amateurish misreporting scandal that prompted a (still unresolved) regulatory probe, a boardroom clear-out and a mammoth recapitalisation, they stand at 133p \u2013 and that\u2019s after Thursday\u2019s 29% pop on news of a bid interest from private equity firm Carlyle.\nThe motive behind Carlyle\u2019s approach is unclear. The start of a wider adventure in consolidating the UK\u2019s third-tier lenders? Or just an opportunistic attempt to grab Metro, and a loan book dominated by residential mortgages, at a moment when the chief executive, Dan Frumkin, may have stabilised the ship? The latter seems more likely and, with Metro worth just \u00a3230m, Carlyle would not be betting the farm.\nAfter the accounting calamity of 2019, a takeover has been the most likely final chapter for Metro\u2019s action-packed time on the London market. Frumkin\u2019s turnaround plan is a multi-year affair. One suspects that Metro-weary, and mostly American, shareholders would accept a reasonable offer to sell. That assumes regulators would bless private equity ownership, which is not a given.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority is adamant: Footasylum must be saved for the nation, or at least for its customers, who, it says, would probably \u201cpay more for less choice, worse service and lower quality\u201d if ownership by JD Sports were allowed to stand.\nThe \u00a390m takeover happened as long ago as 2019, and this is the second time the CMA has run the numbers. So JD should probably give up trying to reverse the decision and do what the officials ask and sell the chain.\nBut the fury of the JD chief, Peter Cowgill, is fair. The ruling is baffling. Footasylum, at the point its board surrendered, was adding little competitive bite to the trainers and sportswear market \u2013 the company departed at half its flotation valuation of 2017. Meanwhile, the juggernaut is the direct-to-consumer operations of Nike and Adidas, which Footasylum looks more likely to withstand under JD\u2019s protection.\nBut those arguments have got nowhere. Footasylum has about 70-odd stores, which is tiny in the context of the globally active JD. Let it go.",

The implication was that opposing the vaccine is somehow an expression of M\u0101ori sovereignty.\nIt\u2019s not. What was striking about the \u201cprotest\u201d at Waitangi was that, at the same time as anti-vaxxers and anti-lockdown types were gathering to share their grievances, one of the great veterans of the struggle for M\u0101ori sovereignty \u2013 Hone Harawira \u2013 was manning the Northland borders to prevent the protesters from breaching Ngapuhi territory and putting its people at risk. That same night Harawira was online with another of the great veterans of the sovereignty struggle, Tame Iti, to encourage M\u0101ori to get vaccinated. Tina Ngata from the East Coast, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer from the West Coast, and the vast majority of M\u0101ori sovereignty activists in between are pro-vaccination.\nWhat, then, does this make a M\u0101ori anti-vaxxer when the vast majority of M\u0101ori sovereignty activists oppose you?\nAnti-vaxxers \u2013 whether M\u0101ori or non-M\u0101ori \u2013 often fall back on their \u201cindividual right to choose\u201d. That makes modest sense. Of course it\u2019s your choice whether to take the vaccine or take your chances with the virus. But that language \u2013 individual right to choose \u2013 strikes as foreign to the M\u0101ori world.\nWe derive our personhood from our whakapapa \u2013 ancestry \u2013 and the complex web of privileges and obligations it confers. We owe obligations, for example, to our ancestors. If we are to claim mana tupuna \u2013 authority deriving from our ancestors \u2013 we must discharge our obligations to care for their land and waterways. That can, in turn, confer the privileges of mana whenua \u2013 the authority to make collective decisions in the use and care of land \u2013 and mana moana \u2013 the authority to make collective decisions in the use and care of water.\nClose readers might note the particular terms in the preceding sentence: mana whenua and mana moana don\u2019t confer the right to make an \u201cindividual\u201d decision \u201cover\u201d land or water. In the western philosophical tradition rights are often inherent to the individual. But in M\u0101ori philosophies rights are derived from our collective relationships. We inherit rights from our ancestors \u2013 and in many cases our land and waterways \u2013 but with those same rights come obligations. Chief among those obligations is the care and protection of children. For whakapapa to survive and thrive it requires the young.\nThis is where anti-vaxxers are, to frame it as bluntly, anti-M\u0101ori. The 1918 influenza pandemic ripped through M\u0101ori communities. According to one estimate M\u0101ori were eight times more likely to contract and die from the virus as Pakeha. The anti-vaxxers who in 2021 discourage M\u0101ori from taking the vaccine risk repeating this history. If M\u0101ori vaccination rates remain as low as they are, and vaccination rates for other groups rapidly approach 90% and above, Covid-19 will become a virus for brown people. In particular, brown children who \u2013 in this moment \u2013 cannot get the vaccine. In the United States children\u2019s hospitals and paediatric intensive care units are overwhelmed as the virus spreads rapidly through the unvaccinated.\nThis is inconsistent with the obligation to care for and protect children. And it makes a mockery of the tino rangatiratanga and He Whakaputanga flags. The surest, and the safest, way to stop the spread of Covid-19 is for eligible adults to get the vaccine.\nAnti-vaxxers often fancy themselves as the only people who see the world for what it is. A scam, a conspiracy. But, in truth, they are the scammers and the conspiracists. And in time, the last vectors left for the virus to spread.",

There are also nine female and 16 male QCs of mixed/multiple ethnicity. By comparison there are 1,303 white men who are QCs and 286 white women, the report says.\nBlack, Asian and other ethnic minority candidates are also less successful in achieving judicial appointment.\nOne anonymous barrister said: \u201cYou have to get over the initial hurdles [of judgment and incorrect assumptions] before you can even start to do the job you have been instructed to do.\u201d\nOthers said there was a need to \u201ctone down your blackness\u201d and \u201cpeople assume that you are a cleaner wearing a suit\u201d.\nThe report contains a number of recommendations including identification of goals for improving diversity within a fixed timescale and annual monitoring of data. There are also more specific recommendations relating to access to the profession, retention, progression and culture.\nThe Bar Council has committed to provide an annual update on actions taken against the recommendations as well as a comprehensive review in 2024.\nDerek Sweeting QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: \u201cWe should reflect honestly on whether long held, and perhaps defensive, assumptions about the bar can survive the evidence and data which the report draws together. The bar is, for most of its members, a modern profession in which hard work and talent offer individuals the opportunity to thrive and contribute to our justice system. That opportunity needs to be open to all.\u201d",

We cannot celebrate before we\u2019ve done the job. We must recognise that this is a fight that we cannot afford to lose,\u201d he added.\nThe clarion call for further climate action followed a day of growing criticism over a flagship deal to \u201ckeep 1.5C alive\u201d by choking off international coal financing and phasing out coal power generation. Green groups, academics and business leaders have warned that the Powering Past Coal Alliance falls short on the ambition and pace required to meet the world\u2019s climate targets.\nThe deal calls for developed economies to phase out the use of coal for electricity generation in the 2030s, and for smaller economies to follow in the 2040s. However, it does not include the world\u2019s biggest coal-dependent economies \u2013 including Australia, China, India and the US \u2013 and a decision from Poland to join the alliance has also attracted criticism after it opted to meet the later phase out deadline of 2049, rather than to transition a decade earlier.\nA US government spokesperson said phaseout targets \u201care very important, but they can\u2019t be seen as an end in themselves\u201d because they \u201chave to be backed up by action\u201d.\n\u201cThe US is already moving forward on a just energy transition. President Biden\u2019s first specific climate pledge was decarbonising the US energy sector by 2035. No one should doubt how serious we are about that,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nLaurie Mompelat, a campaigner with Platform, said people \u201care crying out for real ambition and climate leadership \u2013 phasing out coal and financing for coal is the bare minimum we expect and falls far short of calls for climate justice and climate reparations by polluters, that billions of people around the world need from today\u2019s politicians\u201d.\nIgnacio Galan, the chairman and chief executive of Iberdrola, the owner of Scottish Power and one of the largest clean energy companies in the world, said: \u201cWe need to close down coal completely, and demolish those stations. Otherwise, when we have short term market issues, there is always a temptation to run them again. There is no place for coal in a modern energy system.\u201d\nValentin Vogl, from the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex, added that although phasing out coal for power generation was \u201cto be celebrated\u201d it would be \u201conly half the battle\u201d because coal used to make steel would continue to create emissions.\nThe ambition of the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, to \u201cconsign coal to history\u201d will also face challenges as governments grapple with how to phase out coal power without disadvantaging regions and communities which rely on coal for their local economies, according to delegates. Sharan Burrow of the International Trade Union Confederation said governments must focus on creating new jobs in the green economy.\n\u201cThere can be no stranded worker and no stranded communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know there is no future for coal. That\u2019s painful for our workers. There must be a near exit date for fossil fuels. That\u2019s painful for our workers. The critical message is integrating the urgency of action with the just transition.\u201d\nRajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, told the Cop26 conference that a just energy transition would also need to address the growing demand for electricity from billions of people currently living without access to reliable energy supplies, alongside the need to cut carbon emissions.\n\u201cThat starts with political will,\u201d he told an event hosted by the Energy Transition Commission (ETC). \u201cBut this Cop [summit] and the ETC will not be judged by what was said on this stage, but rather by the speed with which we implement these commitments. We need better plans.\u201d\nShah called for faster moving finance, new technology, and improved regulation to \u201cusher in the energy revolution\u201d, otherwise \u201cwe\u2019ll be back here next year, with more commitments, without the resources and performance to back it up\u201d.\nTanguy Gahouma-Bekale, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators, described the international coal alliance as \u201cvery good news for the world\u201d but stressed that developing countries would need time and funds for the phase out.\nGahouma-Bekale, who is also permanent secretary of Gabon\u2019s climate council and special adviser to the president, Ali Bongo, said: \u201cOur situation in Africa is different. We are still on our way to be developed. We can\u2019t drastically stop coal and oil. For now we need to use it to eradicate poverty and access to energy. We will need support for the transition. And we need to be flexible. For five to 10 years, we must do the two together [coal and renewables] so the transition can be smooth.\u201d\nIn Europe, governments have \u201chad our triumphs\u201d in creating a just energy transition away from coal, according to Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive officer of the European Climate Foundation, \u201cbut also our missteps\u201d.\n\u201cOne example, we have been overpaying utilities for ending coal but it was communities which should have the benefit of this public spending. It\u2019s a warning. Justice and fairness is key to this transition,\u201d she said.",

Plus: a visitor\u2019s guide to a place of \u2018quirky souls\u2019\nGood morning. A 36-year-old man has been charged in relation to Cleo Smith\u2019s alleged abduction. The United Nations says countries have failed to adapt for unavoidable climate damage. And less than 2% of the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s coral reefs have escaped bleaching since 1998.\nWest Australian police have charged 36-year-old man Terence Darrell Kelly in relation to the alleged abduction of Cleo Smith after the four-year-old was found alive and well 18 days after she disappeared. Officers found Cleo about 1am local time on Wednesday alone in a room at a house in Carnarvon, a town 900km north of Perth and just 75km from where her family was camping when she disappeared from their tent on 16 October. Kelly was taken into custody as officers rescued Cleo and he was later questioned about the suspected abduction. Police have said he has no connection to her family.\nCountries have failed to adapt for unavoidable climate damage, the UN said on Thursday at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Developing countries are particularly at risk, but they are unable to muster the cash needed to defend people and resources from flooding, droughts and sea level rises. They are likely to need between US $140bn and $300bn a year by the end of this decade to cope with the impacts, but in 2019 received only $80bn in climate finance, which included cash to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the UN Environment Programme said.\nLess than 2% of the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s coral has escaped bleaching since 1998, according to a new report released Friday in the journal Current Biology. The world\u2019s largest coral reef system has suffered five mass bleaching events in that time \u2013 caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by the burning of fossil fuels \u2013 which have undermined its survival. The most recent event was the most widespread yet. The research found areas \u201cearmarked earlier as candidate refuges\u201d had now experienced severe or moderate bleaching at least once.\nThe Institute of Public Affairs paid to push targeted Facebook ads based on a \u201cfaulty analysis\u201d claiming net zero would cause massive job losses in key Liberal and National seats during last month\u2019s Coalition infighting. Last month, as the Coalition debated a net zero 2050 policy, the IPA paid for a series of Facebook and Instagram ads targeting the electorates of Nationals Barnaby Joyce, David Littleproud, Mark Coulton, Ken O\u2019Dowd and Anne Webster, as well as the Liberal trade minister, Dan Tehan.\nThe Coalition\u2019s voter ID bill could be challenged in court as a disproportionate measure that excludes people from voting, constitutional law expert Prof Anne Twomey has warned. The Morrison government insists nobody would be completely prevented from voting but Twomey argues the proposed legislation could still be struck down for the \u201cimposition of additional administrative burdens that make it more difficult to vote or discourage people from voting\u201d.\nEmergency service volunteers in New South Wales\u2019 far west are under-resourced and under-supported, leaving large stretches of the region without local road crash rescue services, former volunteers say. As state and international borders open up, traffic is expected to increase, which will lead to more crashes, raising fears about the State Emergency Service\u2019s ability to respond in the region.\nFacebook has removed a post by Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister for \u201cinciting and supporting violence\u201d as diplomats stepped up attempts to instigate a ceasefire in the country\u2019s year-long civil war. Abiy Ahmed, the winner of the 2019 Nobel peace prize, vowed to \u201cbury\u201d his government\u2019s enemies in a Facebook post on Sunday as forces from the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) moved closer to Addis Ababa.\nAbout half of the world\u2019s fossil fuel assets will be worthless by 2036 under a net zero transition, according to research published in Nature Energy. Countries that are slow to decarbonise will suffer but early movers will profit; the study finds that renewables and freed-up investment will more than make up for the losses to the global economy.\nUneven vaccine coverage and a relaxation of preventive measures have brought Europe to a \u201ccritical point\u201d in the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said, with cases again at near-record levels and 500,000 more deaths forecast by February.\nDirector and Oscar-winning producer Eva Orner\u2019s new expos\u00e9, Burning, about Australia\u2019s bushfire season of 2019-2020, is \u201cthe documentary Australia and \u2013 I think it is fair to say \u2013 the entire world deserves\u201d, writes Luke Buckmaster. Premiering in Australia at the Sydney film festival before its arrival on Amazon Prime Video on 26 November, Burning explores how anthropogenic climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of fires. \u201cThis is a tremendously well-made film with a burning vitality,\u201d Buckmaster says. \u201cWithout question one of the most important Australian documentaries of the 21st century so far.\u201d\nFor all the advances that have been made in recent decades, disabled people cannot yet participate in society \u201con an equal basis\u201d with others \u2013 and the pandemic has led to many protections being cruelly eroded. \u201cWhat does the utopian city look like, the one in which I participate \u2018on an equal basis\u2019 with others\u201d? I have an inkling,\u201d writes Jan Grue. \u201cI can envision the broad sidewalks and the spacious metro cars departing from perfectly level platforms. What I cannot see, cannot think into being, is a world where there is no greater effort required of me than of the average person, whoever they are. Where the difference between us is erased and I, driving my large, black, powered wheelchair, blend into the crowd.\u201d\n\u201cLiving together has a curious intimacy, a closeness that is hard to predict or plan for, that moves beyond the practicalities and logistics of actually physically moving in together,\u201d writes Patrick Lenton, reflecting on what he\u2019s learned after moving in with his partner during lockdown. \u201cThere is a blend of freedom and big brother style scrutiny that you can\u2019t really prepare for if you\u2019ve never done it before,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found most interesting is the experience of seeing myself through the lens of my partner \u2013 of being suddenly aware of my own actions and routines through her eyes.\u201d\nWhen Scott Morrison left Australia to attend the global climate summit in Glasgow, he left prepared to defend Australia\u2019s checkered position on global heating.

        "content": "North Wall, OxfordWill Howard and Kimberley Jarvis portray more than 20 characters with ease in this superb tale set against the 2001 disaster\nThe new BBC Two documentary Blair and Brown: The New Labour Revolution features the prime minister\u2019s first re-election on 7 June 2001. An historical oddity is that Blair was never meant to win then. Polling had been set for 3 May, but was unusually postponed due to much of the countryside being ringed by quarantine tape under skies foully clouded by the slaughter of 6m cows and sheep to halt foot-and-mouth disease.\nThis time of livestock pyres and troughs of disinfectant in ditches is viscerally invoked in Bobby & Amy, which won writer-director Emily Jenkins a 2019 Fringe First award at the last full Edinburgh festival before theatre itself was sealed off for hygiene reasons.\nIn the Cotswolds, two teenagers, ostracised at school for what peers see as foot-in-mouth manners, start an awkward friendship. When they help at a farm, and adopt a favourite cow, the outcome is as unstoppable as in Sophocles.\nJenkins\u2019 chosen genre is \u201cpoor theatre\u201d, as envisioned by the Polish director Jerzy Grotowski: no sets or props, all power resting on actors\u2019 bodies and voices. This economy pays huge dividends with performers of the effortless flexibility of Will Howard and Kimberley Jarvis. Affecting in the title roles, they share 19 other parts, including mothers, fathers, farmers, pharmacists, council and Defra officials. Howard suddenly embodies both a haughty local equestrian and her horse; Jarvis differentiates teenagers with a simple hair-flick or lip-twitch. In two scenes, the pair play all the people at a crowded town meeting.\nThe revival deliberately coincides with the 20th anniversary of the agriculture epizootic (the veterinary term for widespread animal disease, never going viral as \u201cpandemic\u201d has). Jenkins keeps the piece sealed in time, allowing no retrospective questions such as whether the huge-scale animal slaughter was proportionate and unavoidable.

My integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned,\u201d Paterson said.\nBackbench Conservative MPs, many of whom who had reluctantly supported the government\u2019s extraordinary bid to reopen Paterson\u2019s case on Wednesday, reacted with anger, calling it an \u201cown goal\u201d and \u201ca masterclass in how to turn a minor local crisis into a disaster\u201d.\nMany questioned the judgment of the prime minister for failing to anticipate the scale of disquiet among his own MPs \u2013 or the fact that Downing Street\u2019s bid to set up a cross-party committee to revisit Paterson\u2019s case would be rejected by the opposition.\nJohnson\u2019s U-turn came shortly after the chair of the committee on standards in public life described the government\u2019s behaviour as \u201ca very serious and damaging moment for parliament and public standards in this country\u201d.\nJonathan Evans, a crossbench peer and former director general of the Security Service, said the proposal to revisit anti-sleaze rules, which was backed by the full force of the government\u2019s whips on Wednesday, was an \u201cextraordinary proposal \u2026 deeply at odds with the best traditions of British democracy\u201d and described it as \u201cas an attack on standards\u201d.\nFormer Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, who voted against the motion on Wednesday together with 12 colleagues, described this week\u2019s events as \u201cone of the most unedifying episodes I have seen in my 16 years as a member of parliament\u201d.\n\u201cMy colleagues should not have been instructed, from the very top, to vote for this,\u201d he added.\nAfter revelations in a 2019 Guardian investigation, an investigation by parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Stone found that Paterson repeatedly approached ministers and officials on behalf of two companies that were paying him more than \u00a3100,000.\nThe former Northern Ireland secretary has continued to protest his innocence \u2013 including in a series of interviews after Wednesday\u2019s vote, in which he said he intended to clear his name.\nAndrea Leadsom\u2019s amendment, passed on Wednesday at the behest of Downing Street, would have set up a cross-party committee chaired by former Tory cabinet minister John Whittingdale. But that idea foundered once Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Wednesday his party would not participate.\nAfter Paterson\u2019s resignation, Starmer said, \u201cThis has been an unbelievable 24 hours even by this government\u2019s chaotic standards.\n\u201cBoris Johnson must now apologise to the entire country for this grubby attempt to cover up for the misdemeanour of his friend. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done this but it must be the last. And Boris Johnson must explain how he intends to fix the immense harm he has done to confidence in the probity of him and his MPs.\u201d\nHe had earlier called Johnson\u2019s attempt to prevent Paterson\u2019s suspension \u201ccorruption,\u201d and accused him of \u201cleading his troops through the sewer\u201d.\nAmid reports from Conservative MPs that furious constituents had been emailing to raise the issue with them, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said Johnson had \u201cunderestimated the British people and how badly this would go down, including among many lifelong Conservative voters.\n\u201cIt just shows that the Conservatives are taking people for granted. The public wants decency and honesty from their government, instead under Boris Johnson all they get is lies, chaos and cronyism,\u201d he said.\nSeveral Tory MPs questioned the role of the chief whip Mark Spencer in the debacle, with one saying it would \u201cmake people think twice before trusting the whips,\u201d adding, \u201cwhy take heaps of abuse for defending an unpopular government decision only for it to change its mind the next day?\u201d\nOne frontbencher called the U-turn a \u201cfucking disgrace and huge party mismanagement\u201d. \u201cAnother day, another unforced error,\u201d sighed another.\nAsked whether Johnson continued to have full confidence in Spencer, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cyes\u201d. A Downing Street source insisted last night: \u201cwe\u2019re sticking foursquare behind the chief [whip]\u201d.\nOne junior frontbencher, Michael Gove\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, Angela Richardson, was sacked on Wednesday night after rebelling against the three-line whip by abstaining \u2013 only to be reinstated on Thursday morning.\nBusiness secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was sent out to defend the government\u2019s position in a series of interviews on Thursday morning, just hours before his colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted it had been a mistake to conflate calls for reform of the standards system with an individual case.\nThe prime minister said he was \u201cvery sad\u201d that Paterson had decided to step down.\n\u201cHe has had a distinguished career, serving in two cabinet positions, and above all he has been a voice for freedom \u2013 for free markets and free trade and free societies \u2013 and he was an early and powerful champion of Brexit,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\n\u201cI know that this must have been a very difficult decision but I can understand why \u2013 after the tragic circumstances in which he lost his beloved wife Rose \u2013 he has decided to put his family first.\u201d\nChris Bryant MP, chair of the committee on standards, said: \u201cThe last few days have been regrettable and could all have been avoided if the proper processes were followed all along.

Both had told Nice that there was no evidence to suggest that that approach would reduce stillbirths.\n\u201cBirthrights is delighted that Nice has listened to our concerns \u2013 shared by so many women and birthing people, healthcare professionals and birth workers \u2013 and removed the draft proposals to routinely offer induction at 41 weeks and to single out black and brown women alongside other groups more likely to face adverse outcomes, for induction even earlier at 39 weeks,\u201d said Amy Gibbs, the chief executive of Birthrights.\nNCT voiced concern about the growing use of induction in later-stage pregnancies. Elizabeth Duff, its senior policy adviser, said: \u201cInduction of labour is still an intervention that has been used much more frequently in recent years and as yet there is inadequate information about longer-term impact on babies and parents.\u201d",

        "content": "Backbenchers infuriated as reality dawned and Owen Paterson\u2019s path swerved from invincibility to hasty departure\nIt was while walking through the Commons lobby to vote to save their colleague, Owen Paterson, from immediate suspension after breaching lobbying rules that the reality dawned for many Tory MPs that they could be making a grave mistake.\n\u201cThis is absolute madness,\u201d a minister said, as the MPs begrudgingly carried out an order by No 10 and the whips\u2019 office to block the sanction of Owen Paterson that would have potentially left him facing a byelection.\nWhen the tricky issue of Paterson\u2019s possible suspension reared its head last week, few expected the situation to end as it did. A two-year investigation into the North Shropshire MP by the standards commissioner and committee concluded that he should be banned from the Commons for 30 days.\nMost Tories agreed it was a tricky position. Either they created a massive rift in the party by choosing to send down one of their own, or they stuck together and proceeded down a dangerous path risking allegations of \u201csleaze\u201d.\nThe vote was scheduled for Wednesday, and Paterson, his allies and the government set about devising a plan to spare him by creating a new committee chaired by a Tory MP to reconsider the case, and review the entire sanction system. Most keenly, they wanted politicians who felt wrongly adjudicated against to be able to appeal against the decision.\nOther ideas were discussed that involved limiting Paterson\u2019s suspension. But these were rejected by the MP, who was steadfast in the belief that he deserved no punishment.\nBernard Jenkin was one of the four standards committee members in the Conservative party, but he recused himself from the investigation because he was a personal friend of Paterson, and his wife had been equally close to Paterson\u2019s wife, who died in 2020. He was said by colleagues to have worked the hardest behind the scenes to help Paterson.\nThe deadline for tabling amendments to motions was around 7pm on Tuesday. Much deliberation had gone into whose name should be top of the amendment. It was decided that Paterson or one of his close allies such as Jenkin being listed as the proposer would look too much like a stitch-up. So the former business secretary Andrea Leadsom was called upon.\nLeadsom, one of the organisers said, had \u201cthe veneer of respectability\u201d \u2013 a former Commons leader who was well-respected by Tory and opposition MPs for her work in strengthening the system set up for investigating MPs accused of bullying and harassment.\nShe was called, on Tuesday afternoon, to the office of the chief whip, Mark Spencer, and accepted the suggestion that she should propose a new committee to reform the standards system.\nShe was given a word document with the text of the amendment, but to avoid appearing to let Paterson off the hook, insisted on a hard deadline for the committee to report by \u2013 February 2022. Meanwhile, the former culture secretary John Whittingdale was lined up to chair the committee. Though given he was isolating with Covid-19 he was not able to attend any in-person discussions.\nOne senior Tory claimed the Downing Street aide Henry Newman was crucial in pushing for the move to protect Paterson. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, worked particularly hard lobbying the 2019 intake of Tory MPs, who were less likely to know Paterson. \u201cI\u2019m going to be putting my neck on the line for someone who literally wouldn\u2019t recognise me in a corridor,\u201d one grumbled.\nAs the deadline for tabling amendments drew near Jenkin was in a state of agitation. Tory whips began ringing MPs and asking if they would back it, and later that evening \u2013 after the chief whip called Boris Johnson to assure him they had the numbers \u2013 the prime minister agreed to go ahead with the plan.\nWhen the Leadsom amendment finally went in at 6pm, frantic conversations began in the Table Office responsible for receiving submissions for inclusion on the order paper.\nAfter some tweaks the clerks pronounced it was \u201cin order\u201d, meaning it was able to be submitted. \u201cOne hurdle down,\u201d a Paterson supporter said, cautiously. There was then a nervous wait overnight as the Speaker and more clerks decided whether the amendment should be selected. At 11:15am on Wednesday, the white smoke came.\nMinutes later, a message was texted to Tory MPs telling them they faced a three-line whip. Many frantically skim-read the report, raising fresh concerns with their whips and saying they still believed Paterson was guilty. Some said that, despite reservations, they thought the standards system needed reform and so prepared to back the amendment, if grudgingly.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t being paid \u00a3100,000 just for his good looks, was he?\u201d one MP said wryly, at around 2pm. The pressure continued to build as the slew of emails pouring in from outraged constituents gathered pace in the final hours before the vote. An anxious MP admitted: \u201cMy inbox is in meltdown. I know the usual suspects \u2013 the messages I\u2019m getting aren\u2019t coming from them.\u201d\nWhen the division bells rang just 247 Tories traipsed through the \u201caye\u201d lobby in a total of 361. Ministers grumbled loudly about how they had been told to vote for a measure meant to provide \u201cnatural justice\u201d they thought might do the opposite in Paterson\u2019s case. Missing were several other ministers given permission to be away from the vote because they were meant to be on trips outside Westminster, but who were in fact hiding in their offices. Most were genuinely away on business.\nAs the result was read out, shivers were sent down the government frontbench as they realised the vote had only been won with a majority of 18. Cries of \u201cshame\u201d echoed around the chamber from furious opposition politicians who vowed to boycott the new committee, and comprehension dawned on the chief whip that the situation was unsustainable.\nDepressed Tory MPs slunk off into the night, as their inboxes filled further with angry emails. One who reluctantly voted for the amendment said: \u201cI really regret it.\u201d\nThe recriminations were swift. Angela Richardson was sacked as a parliamentary private secretary to Michael Gove\u2019s levelling up department, after refusing to follow the whips\u2019 instructions and instead abstaining.\nAlarm bells started ringing at No 10. The ever media-conscious prime minister would have been worried by the negative newspaper front pages that were landing that evening. \u201cShameless MPs sink back into sleaze,\u201d proclaimed the Daily Mail.\nPaterson\u2019s series of interviews that evening only made matters worse. \u201cHe was acting like he\u2019d got away with it,\u201d a Tory observer noted.\nThe difficulty of reforming the standards system without cross-party consensus became increasingly obvious. Doubts grew among Leadsom and Whittingdale. They hoped the opposition boycott threats were just bluster. But that was not borne out.\nJenkin kept pushing, however, saying the committee would be fine because it could still be a quorate with only Conservative members. But his continued confidence was not shared by senior government figures. By Thursday morning, Johnson and Spencer had accepted that a massive mistake had been made.\nWhile ministers were still out on the airwaves defending the previous night\u2019s events, the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, prepared to make a humiliating climbdown at the same despatch box he had stood at more than 12 hours earlier defending the amendment.\nAt the weekly business questions Rees-Mogg admitted the new committee to scrutinise Paterson and the whole standards system could not work without buy-in from the other parties. Peter Bone, a veteran Tory backbencher, also revealed that overnight his constituency office in Wellingborough had been vandalised, with the words \u201cTory sleaze\u201d.\nDespite the high levels of anger the night before by those who felt strong-armed into supporting Paterson, it was nothing compared to the wave of fury unleashed when MPs realised it had all been in vain.\nOne said she had \u201cbeen flung under a bus for one man\u201d and asked \u201cwas it worth it?\u201d Another, reeling just minutes after the U-turn, called it a \u201cfucking disgraceful\u201d situation and criticised the \u201chuge party mismanagement\u201d by the whips. Richardson was reinstated as Gove\u2019s PPS.\nRealising the game was up, Paterson announced on Thursday afternoon he would resign as an MP. It was reported that he had had the rug pulled from under his feet and was given no notice of Rees-Mogg\u2019s statement, and had instead been told by a reporter who had phoned him for his reaction while he was out shopping.\nBut Downing Street insisted he had been told before the extraordinary U-turn was announced. Leadsom escaped to Cop26 in Glasgow and Johnson released a tribute to Paterson that evening, saying he was \u201cvery sad\u201d his friend and colleague for decades was leaving parliament.",

Texas Senate Bill 1\u2019s restrictions on voter assistance at the polls and on which absentee ballots cast by eligible voters can be accepted by election officials are unlawful and indefensible,\u201d Kristen Clarke, the head of the department\u2019s civil rights division, said in a statement announcing the suit.\n\u201cTexas leaders must be held accountable for their blatant abuse of power in a shameless attempt to keep themselves in power,\u201d said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic party.\nThe lawsuit comes as Joe Biden faces mounting pressure to enact federal legislation to protect voting rights.\nRepublicans have successfully used the filibuster four times this year to block voting rights bills in the US Senate.\nThe most recent filibuster came on Wednesday, when Republicans blocked a bill that would have restored a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required states with repeated evidence of voting discrimination, including Texas, to pre-clear voting laws with the federal government before they go into effect.\nNineteen states have passed 33 laws this year restricting voting access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. This is the second major voting rights suit Biden\u2019s DoJ has filed this year.

        "content": "Leicester still control their Europa League destiny but know they must improve to progress. They have to win their last two group games \u2013 against Legia Warsaw and Napoli \u2013 to be sure of advancing in a tournament where, so far, they have mixed patches of class with blotches of ineptitude. This match was a case in point.\nBrendan Rodgers\u2019 side dominated but sloppily fell behind to a goal by Victor Moses. Daniel Amartey drew them level before Jamie Vardy bungled a chance to claim victory by dabbing a weak penalty at Aleksandr Selikhov, who saved it to give Spartak a point that keeps all four teams in Group C in the hunt for the only automatic qualification spot. Leicester sit third.\n\u201cThe game was there to be won,\u201d said Kasper Schmeichel, who admitted his team need to sharpen up at both ends in order to regain the consistency that has eluded them this season. \u201c[Spartak] had a couple of chances and they scored and at the moment that\u2019s a problem for us, we\u2019re conceding too many goals. [Defending] is something we\u2019re working on every single day but it\u2019s not working too well at the minute. But we have a track record that\u2019s pretty good over the last few years so we\u2019re confident it will come back.\u201d\nRodgers was quick to identity the problem that led to Moses\u2019s goal. It was, he acknowledged, a recurring one. \u201cIt was really poor from our perspective,\u201d he said. It came from Spartak\u2019s first serious attack, early in the second half, when Mikhail Ignatov was allowed to canter down the right and deliver a cross for Moses, who was free to guide a header beyond Schmeichel from 10 yards after Youri Tielemans and Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 watched him dash into the box and find space between Amartey and Jonny Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s about running, simple as that,\u201d said Rodgers, pointing out that his team also failed to track back effectively against Arsenal last weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward: you have to run, you have to do the dirty side of the game.\u201d\nRodgers was broadly satisfied with much of the other aspects of his team\u2019s play. They began strongly and passed and moved cleverly \u2013 right up until the final touch, which was too often scruffy. \u201cPerformance-wise we played well against a team that sits deep. But we just never had the killer instinct to take our chances,\u201d he said.\nSlow starts have been a recurring problem for Leicester this season but they were quick out of the blocks this time, with Amartey firing off their first shot in the second minute. Kelechi Iheanacho and Ayoze P\u00e9rez then threatened and, whether by strategy or obligation, Spartak soon found themselves defending deep and en masse for prolonged periods.\nLeicester had to be both fast and patient as they tried to prise the visitors open. Soumar\u00e9 nearly blew them away in the 17th minute but his wonderful left-footed shot from 25 yards cannoned off the bar before the goalkeeper even saw it.\nLeicester\u2019s defensive fortitude was barely tested in the first half. When Roman Zobnin nicked the ball off Ryan Bertrand in the 34th minute, Caglar Soyuncu blocked the midfielder\u2019s shot before Schmeichel had to think about making a save. The problem for Leicester was that, despite their control, Selikhov did not have to work very hard in the first half either. Patson Daka should have got him diving, at least, in the 42nd minute but the striker miskicked from 10 yards after a jagged run by Iheanacho.\nNeither manager made changes during the interval and the second half looked to be settling into the pattern established in the first, with Leicester hogging the ball and Spartak hoping for a chance to counterattack while defending vigilantly. More vigilantly than Leicester, as it turned out: when Ignatov went on a run down the right in the 50th minute and produced an inviting cross, Moses was there to head his team into the lead.\nHappily for the hosts, Amartey soon made his presence felt at the other end. P\u00e9rez flicked on a corner by Bertrand and the Ghanaian rose to plant an emphatic header into the net. That electrified Leicester. Now they chased the win, and Spartak dug in anew.\nWith 20 minutes left, Rodgers turned to an old reliable, introducing Vardy for Daka. Well, usually reliable. Five minutes after joining the action the striker missed a penalty, his weak effort leaving Selikhov with a straightforward save after Moses was judged to have fouled Ademola Lookman. Leicester still had time to produce a worse miss. Iheanacho inadvertently blocked a header by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, then the striker blasted the rebound off a post from close range.",

But the initial result means students face further disruption to their courses in a dispute that stretches back to 2018, including two weeks of strikes in early 2020 before the campus closures that followed the coronavirus outbreak.\nJo Grady, the UCU\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThese results are a clear mandate for strike action over pension cuts and should be heard loud and clear by university employers.\n\u201cStaff in universities have given their all to support students during the pandemic but management have responded by trying to slash their guaranteed pension by 35%. In a ballot window of just three weeks our members have made it abundantly clear that they will not accept these vindictive attacks on their retirement.\n\u201cIt is now in the gift of employers to avoid strike action, which is the outcome staff want as well.\u201d\nBalloting took place at 68 universities, and 37 passed the statutory threshold for strike action. The universities voting to go on strike include Cambridge, Edinburgh, Belfast and Liverpool, as well as the Open University.\nUCU\u2019s higher education executive will meet on 12 November to decide its next moves, including timing. Several branches have been pushing for strikes to take place before Christmas.\nThe fight revolves around the valuation and management of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), one of the largest private pension schemes in the UK, which enrols lecturers, researchers, technicians, librarians and administrators at many higher education institutions and research centres.\nUniversities UK (UUK), representing employers, has defended changes to the pension scheme as necessary to maintain its affordability. It claims the annual pension cuts only amount to between 10% and 18% of benefits, rather than 35% as UCU claims, and are needed to avoid higher contributions from staff and employers.\nWhen the strike ballot was announced, UUK said: \u201cAfter a difficult 18 months, students do not deserve any further disruption. It is unclear why UCU thinks it\u2019s appropriate for students to suffer due to the scheme\u2019s increased costs and the regulatory constraints under which pensions operate in the UK.\u201d\nThe National Union of Students has said it supports the strike action, saying that \u201cstudents will hold employers responsible\u201d if a negotiated settlement is not reached.",

It is a fossil fuel,\u201d said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics and lead author of the new report. \u201cGas is the new coal. Governments, investors and the financial sector must treat it the same way as they do coal: phase it out as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe UK government, which is hosting crucial UN climate talks under way in Glasgow, has vowed to help \u201cconsign coal to history\u201d, with the summit producing an agreement signed by more than 40 countries, including major users Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea, to phase out the carbon-intensive fuel.\nThe focus on eliminating coal comes as countries such as the US and Australia have ramped up their use of supposedly cleaner sources of gas and sought to cash in on a global export market of liquified gas with new infrastructure to ship it around the world.\nBut growth in gas has had a significant influence over global heating, with the Climate Analytics report finding that gas was the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions increase in the past decade, rising by 42% and causing 60% of the methane emissions from fossil fuel production. Methane is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas that is many times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat.\nIf the world is to avert disastrous 1.5C of global heating the use of gas should already be in decline, according to the report, but it is projected to cause 70% of the fossil CO2 emissions increase by 2030 under current policies.\nThis means unabated gas use must peak this decade and then drop sharply, the analysis finds, necessitating a decrease of 30% below last year\u2019s levels by 2030 and then a 65% decrease by 2040. Renewable energy such as solar and wind should be ramped up to take the place of gas, according to the report.\nHare said that governments need to be questioned as to why they are not targeting gas as well as coal. \u201cUltimately, gas is a bridge to nowhere,\u201d he said.",

Sanjeev Gupta must urgently fix these problems if he is to be seen as a fit and proper owner of steel companies in the UK.\u201d\nLiberty Steel was last month able to restart operations at its plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge, both in south Yorkshire, after a partial \u00a350m refinancing. However, the MPs said they still had concerns over the lack of transparency over the funding terms.\nTheir report called for the government\u2019s Insolvency Service to examine \u201cwhether, on the basis of the evidence we have received, Sanjeev Gupta may have acted in breach of his fiduciary duties as a company director in the United Kingdom\u201d.\nAmong their other findings, the MPs also said Liberty Steel employees were \u201cprevented from performing their roles and duties adequately\u201d because of a structure that centralised crucial information and control with Gupta and GFG. This was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for such a large group, the MPs said.\nGFG and Greensill Capital, they said, used \u201chigh-risk financial practices\u201d to fund the businesses, including lending based on \u201cfuture receivables\u201d \u2013 invoices that did not yet exist. Investigations have found Greensill loaned money to Gupta\u2019s company based on notional future invoices for products which it had not yet sold.\nThe report confirmed previous findings that Greensill Capital had lent \u00a3300m more than it should have to GFG companies under the government\u2019s coronavirus large business interruption loans scheme, which was supposed to be limited to \u00a350m per company or group.\nThey said the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the audit regulator, should refer the auditors of Liberty Steel companies, King & King, for investigation. The small firm had \u201ca lack of capacity to complete audits effectively\u201d, the report said.\nMilan Patel, a partner at King & King, previously told the committee his organisation was capable of auditing an organisation of GFG\u2019s size and said the firm had \u201cmany clients who have hundreds of millions of pounds of turnover\u201d.\nA GFG Alliance spokesman said the group would \u201creview and reflect upon\u201d the report\u2019s conclusions, and added that the Liberty Steel had \u201ca secure pathway to recovery\u201d.\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the report fails to recognise the significant role Sanjeev Gupta and Liberty Steel has played in saving and safeguarding thousands of UK jobs which otherwise would have been lost,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\u201cMr Gupta has consistently met his obligations as a director of a private company, and with the restructuring and transformation committee has led GFG\u2019s global restructuring since Greensill\u2019s collapse which has enabled the refinancing of our Australian operations and laid the foundations to achieve secure financing across the group.\u201d\nKing & King was approached for comment.\nSpokespeople for Grant Thornton, the administrators of Greensill Capital, and for Lex Greensill, the finance firm\u2019s founder, declined to comment, as did the FRC.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are determined to secure a competitive future for the UK steel industry and in recent years have provided it with extensive support, including \u200bmore than \u00a3600m to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. We are working closely with the sector to support its transition to a low-carbon future in a way that supports competitiveness, jobs and clean growth.\n\u201cWe recognise the critical role the steel industry plays in all areas of the UK and in our economy and will carefully consider the report\u2019s recommendations.\u201d",

Getting vaccinations, wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces and taking regular Covid-19 tests all make an important difference but it is also crucial that we don\u2019t overlook the value of ventilation.\n\u201cWith winter fast approaching and people spending more time indoors, it\u2019s vital everyone understands the importance of using ventilation, such as regularly opening windows \u2013 even if just for a few minutes \u2013 to keep the air moving and prevent infections.\u201d\nThe Department of Health and Social Care is asking people to take ventilation more seriously after a representative survey of 3,000 people in England found that 64% do not know that opening windows helps limit Covid\u2019s spread and only 29% do so when visitors come to their home.\nIt said: \u201cWith fewer restrictions in place this winter, following the success of the vaccination programme, the act of refreshing air in the home when people have visitors is even more important for everyone to keep infections down.\u201d\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, the leader of the British Medical Association, welcomed the campaign and belated communication with the public about the benefits of ventilation.\nBut he added: \u201cWe believe action should go further than a campaign, by setting explicit standards for ventilation in public spaces, including the appropriate use of CO2 monitors to assess adequate levels of ventilation.\n\u201cThere should also be resources and guidance to businesses so they can implement changes.\u201d\nExperts involved in the push on ventilation hope to prompt a much greater use of open windows, especially with much greater social mixing indoors set to occur before and during the festive period.",

Jury selection had taken 11 days.\nSpeaking on Wednesday outside the Glynn county courthouse in Georgia, Arbery\u2019s mother Wanda Cooper-Jones said she found the final jury\u2019s racial makeup \u201cdevastating\u201d but was confident the jury would \u201cmake the right decision\u201d.\nArbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was killed while out jogging in the coastal town of Satilla Shores, Georgia. None of the men involved were charged until eyewitness footage was made public months later, shortly before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, prompting widespread protests.\nProsecutors had urged Walmsley, who is overseeing the trial in south Georgia, to reverse the striking of the eight Black potential jurors, whom they said had been intentionally targeted over race. A landmark 1986 US supreme court decision in Batson v Kentucky ruled it unconstitutional for potential jurors to be struck solely based on race or ethnicity.\nBut Walmsley, while acknowledging the apparent \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d, cited limitations spelled out in the supreme court precedent and pointed to defense lawyers\u2019 justifications, which did not mention race or ethnicity.\nGlynn county, Georgia, where the trial is taking place and where Arbery was killed, is 26% Black and 69% white.\nArbery was shot dead in February 2020 when the three men pursued him while he was out on a run, claiming they suspected his involvement in a series of burglaries in the neighborhood. Arbery had been recorded on surveillance footage entering and leaving a semi-constructed house in the town that day, but no evidence has linked him to any offense.\nThe McMichaels, both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery in a roadway using their pickup truck. Travis McMichael then fired three times with a shotgun. All three men are expected to argue the shooting occurred in self-defense and will cite provisions under Georgia\u2019s now defunct citizen\u2019s arrest law to justify their actions.\nAs well as the state criminal charges, the three accused men face federal hate crimes and attempted kidnap charges in a separate case brought by the US justice department. Their federal trial is due to start in February 2022.",

Boom! and The Eyes of Tammy Faye tipped for Oscars success, he discusses his inner malevolence, his mother\u2019s death \u2013 and his \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 time as Spider-Man \nAndrew Garfield is smiling beatifically and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. The pose suits an actor who has cornered the market in the holy and heroic, from a Jesuit priest in Silence to a Seventh-day Adventist saving lives on the battlefield in Hacksaw Ridge; from a man left paralysed by polio in Breathe to a credulous innocent who dies surrendering his organs in Never Let Me Go. He is a remarkable actor, but watch too many of his movies back to back and you are liable to hear celestial trumpets.\nHis prayer-like gesture of gratitude comes in response to my promise not to ask whether he and his fellow former web-slinger Tobey Maguire will be appearing in the new Spider-Man: No Way Home. \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d says the 38-year-old, speaking over Zoom from Calgary, where he is shooting the murder-and-Mormons series Under the Banner of Heaven. There seems no point posing the Spidey question when he has greeted each identical inquiry this year with a display of shrugging bafflement that may or may not be genuine. (Let\u2019s see when the movie opens next month.)\nBesides, there is enough to discuss without speculating about projects in which he may not even appear. Mainstream, the first of his three new movies, is a kind of Network for the internet age. Garfield plays a street-corner situationist who becomes a superstar when a video of him haranguing shoppers while dressed as a rat goes viral. He also howls at the moon, pretends to be a ninja and runs through Los Angeles naked but for a giant prosthetic penis. The film couldn\u2019t be any wackier if people started vomiting emojis. Oh wait, they do.\nSuch exuberance may be in short supply today, he warns me. \u201cA few of us went up a mountain yesterday. It was an insane 11-mile climb, so now I\u2019m slightly not-a-person.\u201d He is slumped on a sofa, his notoriously sculptural hair nowhere to be seen; in a classic can\u2019t-be-arsed move, he is hiding his locks under a baseball cap. But if this is him on half-speed, it is still impressive. Just wind him up and watch him go.\nTake the subject of Mainstream. \u201cI had a lot of fun creating a really extreme character and I haven\u2019t had a chance to hang out in those regions of myself \u2013 the ego and the id \u2013 in such an extreme kind of uncensored and shadowy, dark way, so what was appealing was that I got to go to very outlandish, outrageous, unlikable \u2013 or not even that, beyond likability or unlikability; that wasn\u2019t even a consideration. It was attempting to reach the places that great liberated artists like Kanye West can sometimes get to, where he just goes beyond any form of delineation or box-making or pigeon-holing; it just is, it\u2019s that id place, those pure unconscious primal urges.\u201d Splendid. Now breathe.\nEven admirers of Mainstream won\u2019t be expecting it to figure in the Oscars race, whereas it will be a pity if Garfield isn\u2019t nominated for one of the other two. In Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s adaptation of Jonathan Larson\u2019s musical Tick, Tick \u2026 Boom!, Garfield hurls himself into the role of that frantic, gifted playwright, who died in 1996 just hours before the off-Broadway opening of his soon-to-be-hit-show Rent. He is also excellent in The Eyes of Tammy Faye as the corrupt televangelist Jim Bakker, opposite Jessica Chastain as his doting wife, Tammy Faye.\nAside from the misunderstood modern noir Under the Silver Lake, where Garfield was an amateur gumshoe prone to voyeurism and stalking, Mainstream and The Eyes of Tammy Faye represent the first time he has played anyone who could be described as a jerk. \u201cLet me see if I can correct you,\u201d he says. \u201cUm. Yeah. No. Maybe my character in Red Riding exhibits some self-centred kind of \u2026?\u201d On the contrary: in that Channel 4 crime drama from early in Garfield\u2019s career, his character goes out in a blaze of glory, martyring himself for the cause of justice. \u201cHe does, yeah, you\u2019re right. For whatever reason, I\u2019ve found myself more in heroic, altruistic, champion-of-the-light kinds of characters and stories.\u201d\nHe understands the desire to see performers explore moral ambiguity: \u201cTom Hanks is one of my favourite actors and I would love him to expose those darker regions of humanity that we all have in us.\u201d Hanks has admitted that villains \u201crequire some degree of malevolence that I don\u2019t think I can fake\u201d.\nDoes Garfield have malevolence in him? \u201cI think if I said no, I\u2019d probably have a nightmare tonight in which I\u2019m shown all my malevolence. Any denial of it would probably pique its interest: \u2018Oh, you reckon?\u2019 I think we are vastly unknowable unless we meditate 18 hours a day and/or go on mushroom trips to discover all the nooks and crannies of ourselves.\u201d\nWhat have his own mushroom trips taught him? \u201cAh, that may be a bit too personal to go into.\u201d In 10 words or fewer? \u201cHaha! Yeah, right. I\u2019m definitely aware that I\u2019m not aware of the majority of what I am.\u201d\nUnlike his Silence co-star Adam Driver, who can drop anchor anywhere between tenderness and savagery, Garfield is on the side of the angels \u2013 literally so in his Tony-winning performance on stage in Angels in America. As with the actor, so with the man. He is warm, conscientious and affable \u2013 I could happily have talked with him for another hour or two \u2013 but he also comes across as a bit of a goody-goody. \u201cReally?\u201d he laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that! I don\u2019t think I present as goody-goody. But that\u2019s your story and you can stick to it if you want.\u201d\nI challenge him to name the last time he behaved like an arsehole, or used his fame to gain advantage. He can even treat this interview as a forum in which to apologise to someone he wronged. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I have to prove I\u2019m not a goody-goody.\u201d His eyes search the room. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever used my fame to be an arsehole. I think I would be able to admit it. Maybe I might have used it to get a table at a restaurant occasionally.\u201d Come on, I tell him, everyone says that. It is the equivalent of Theresa May running through fields of wheat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he says. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a goody-goody, then. Maybe that\u2019s the extent of it.\u201d\nThe worst you could say is that he misspoke during an interview at the National Theatre in 2017. Referring to his preparation for Angels in America, he described himself as \u201ca gay man right now, just without the physical act\u201d \u2013 that old dilettante routine, of which LGBTQ+ people have justifiably grown sick.\nLeaked emails in 2015 also described him refusing to leave his hotel room for a prestigious Sony jamboree at which the release date for his third Spider-Man outing \u2013 later scrapped, after the critical and commercial disappointment of the second \u2013 was due to be announced: \u201cHere we are about one hour away from our gala event and Andrew decides he doesn\u2019t want to attend. He has a rather scruffy beard and he just wants to be left alone.\u201d Still, it is small potatoes compared with some of his colleagues; Mel Gibson or Shia LaBeouf he is not.\nMainstream and The Eyes of Tammy Faye demonstrate that media attention can be toxic. How has he avoided being corrupted by it? \u201cWell, I will co-sign that,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI appreciate you saying that. I think I\u2019ve surrounded myself with things that make the deeper parts of me come alive rather than the ones that will be a coke-filled orgy of a moment and will then feel like total shit the next morning. I know that shit doesn\u2019t last.\u201d\nHe gives some of the credit to his mother. \u201cShe would always go back to nature and find herself being nourished by the small, natural things in life, in that pantheistic kind of way \u2013 the rabbits at the bottom of her garden \u2013 rather than anything flashy or fancy. I\u2019ve had that awareness since I was a kid, so maybe it was her.\u201d\nHis mother died of cancer two years ago. Knowing the end was near, Garfield flew home from the set of The Eyes of Tammy Faye to be with her for the final weeks of her life. \u201cIt was the best possible version,\u201d he says. \u201cMe losing her rather than her losing me.\u201d What was she like? \u201cShe was someone who had an awareness of the beauty that\u2019s around us, and the kindness she could exhibit to someone in the street or at the store. That\u2019s a good life. That\u2019s a life well lived.\u201d\nIt was she who nudged him towards acting when he was having a tough time at school. \u201cWhat a dangerous, bold, loving, soulful thing to do. She knew I probably wouldn\u2019t make any money from it, but she saw her son was having trouble and was not feeling a sense of joy about being alive. And it turned out to be the best worst decision she ever made, because now I\u2019m talking to you about her and she\u2019s embarrassed somewhere.\u201d\nGarfield\u2019s mother was British and his father is American. He was born in Los Angeles and his family moved to Surrey when he was three. \u201cI was raised in a sports household. Very competitive with my older brother. My dad\u2019s a swimming coach, I did gymnastics and swimming, rugby and cricket and football.\u201d\nWhat he experienced as a sports prodigy, he says, was \u201ca micro version of the Simone Biles thing\u201d. He has been thinking a lot lately about Biles, the 24-year-old US gymnast who withdrew from five of her six Olympics finals this year to safeguard her mental health. \u201cThe fact that she decided to publicly honour her own fallibility may be the most inspiring move she could make. Most of us seeing that will go: \u2018Oh my God! That means I can fail. I don\u2019t always have to be ascending.\u2019\u201d\nHe had a similar epiphany. \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t want a big fat Russian gymnastics coach to be sitting on my back while I do the box splits at the age of nine. I wanna go be a punk with my friends and go skateboarding and listen to Rage Against the Machine and be a bit of a fuckup for a minute.\u2019 There was a natural inclination to own being a fucking idiot.\u201d\nHearing this, it is hard not to think back to him in that hotel room, nursing his scruffy beard and refusing to play ball with the bigwigs. His spell as Spider-Man now seems like a source of anguish. Speaking about it in 2017, he said: \u201cI got my heart broken a little bit.\u201d How so?\n\u201cI went from being a naive boy to growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cHow could I ever imagine that it was going to be a pure experience?\u201d He gives a dry, joyless laugh. \u201cThere are millions of dollars at stake and that\u2019s what guides the ship. It was a big awakening and it hurt.\n\u201cComic-Con in San Diego is full of grown men and women still in touch with that pure thing the character meant to them. [But] you add in market forces and test groups and suddenly the focus is less on the soul of it and more on ensuring we make as much money as possible. And I found that \u2013 find that \u2013 heartbreaking in all matters of the culture. Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us and led to the terrible ecological collapse that we are all about to die under.\u201d\nHe cracks up suddenly at his own portentousness, a full-blown goofy guffaw. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding, I\u2019m just kidding!\u201d Pause. \u201cI mean, it\u2019ll take a bunch of years before that happens.\u201d Even the apocalypse doesn\u2019t sound too bad coming from Mr Goody-Goody.\n Mainstream is available on digital download in the UK from 8 November; Tick, Tick \u2026 Boom! is in cinemas on 12 November and on Netflix from 19 November; and The Eyes of Tammy Faye is in UK cinemas from 4 February 2022",

        "content": "Concern over role Rahul Gupta played in shutting down West Virginia\u2019s largest syringe service program in the state\u2019s capital \nJoe Biden is on record as the first US president to embrace a concept known as \u201charm reduction\u201d \u2013 a public health approach that aims to mitigate harm done by drug use instead of the traditional just-say-no-ism of past administrations.\nAdministration officials have said last week that the federal government will now support harm reduction concepts \u2013 like giving sterile syringes to people who inject drugs \u2013 in an effort to curb the transmission of infectious diseases.\nBut the Biden administration has appointed Rahul Gupta as the nation\u2019s new director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy despite the West Virginian\u2019s controversial relationship to harm reduction policies in the past.\nThe appointment of Gupta, a personal friend of Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator, has sparked concern among some drug policy campaigners who see the move as at odds with the administration\u2019s stated aims of a change in focus when it comes to harm reduction policies.\nThe biggest criticism of the new \u201cdrug czar\u201d comes from public health experts who recall the role he played in shutting down West Virginia\u2019s largest syringe service program in the state\u2019s capital of Charleston \u2013 now home to what the CDC has called \u201cthe most concerning HIV outbreak in the nation\u201d.\nIn the wake of the program\u2019s shutdown, which Gupta supported, the state has formalized new legislation that is likely to shut down nearly all of its harm reduction programs despite facing multiple, new HIV clusters related to injection drug use.\nWhen Gupta began working as the director for the West Virginia bureau of public health in 2015, the state was entering a new phase of the opioid crisis. Prescription pill usage was trending down, but only because it was being replaced by people injecting heroin and fentanyl. The number of overdoses in West Virginia for that year was more than twice as high as the number of people who had died in car accidents.\nNationwide, the increase in injection drug use drove an uptick in new HIV cases, especially in small towns. In rural communities across the nation, where syringe possession without a prescription is often criminalized, people hooked on opioids still face two options: reuse (and perhaps share) already used needles or go into potentially fatal drug withdrawal.\nOne town of 3,700 people in south-eastern Indiana went from having fewer than five HIV cases to 235 seemingly overnight in 2015. Surrounding local governments, desperate to find solutions, decided to buck small town conservatism and try an idea typically found in large cities, one grassroots outreach workers had been using for years: harm reduction.\nAlthough these governments couldn\u2019t prevent people from using drugs, they could reduce the harm associated with their use \u2013 especially the impact their drug use had on public health. A syringe program was started in Scott county, Indiana, to provide people who inject drugs with sterile syringes. The results were staggering.\nIn less than a year, there was an 88% drop in syringe sharing \u2013 a critical victory in controlling the spread of HIV. Public health experts across the nation identified the Indiana program as the first step in preventing HIV transmission among people who inject drugs.\nAfter the outbreak in Indiana, the CDC identified 220 counties across the US considered high risk for HIV outbreaks associated with IV drug use. Of West Virginia\u2019s 55 counties, 28 were on that list.\nOfficials in West Virginia\u2019s capital city, Charleston, started a syringe program through the local health department. The West Virginia bureau of public health, led at the time by Gupta, established statewide guidelines and the Kanawha Charleston health department sterile syringe program began operation.\nBut in West Virginia, where Donald Trump\u2019s brand of conservatism led to a state-record shattering 42.2% margin of victory in 2016, the rhetoric of giving syringes to people who use drugs was a hard sell.\nThe KCHD syringe program served nearly 25,000 people in the three years it operated. For a city of 49,000 residents, the program was meeting a massive demand for clean syringes. But, by 2018, conservative politicians and residents alike had successfully rallied against the program.\nAn ugly public feud pitted former mayor Danny Jones and his supporters against the program and anyone who supported it. Jones, who in an interview had professed that people who use drugs should \u201cbe locked up until they\u2019re clean\u201d, enacted a series of changes in the program that included putting a police officer in charge of its design.\nThe biggest criticism of Dr Gupta from his time as the state\u2019s public health commissioner stems from an audit of the syringe program that was instigated by Jones. Flouting CDC recommendations that support lowering barriers to access and guidelines set up by his own office, Gupta\u2019s audit called for a suspension of the syringe program because it didn\u2019t require participants to first seek treatment for drug use before accessing clean syringes.\nDr Robin Pollini, an epidemiologist at West Virginia University, and six other harm reduction experts nationwide wrote letters speaking out against Gupta\u2019s findings saying his central criticism \u2013 that treatment options weren\u2019t being prioritized above syringe access \u2013 showed he missed the point of harm reduction entirely.\nIn an interview with the Guardian Pollini said: \u201cThe report was arbitrary in faulting the program for not adhering to practices that were not even required by the state certification guidelines\u201d \u2013 guidelines written by Gupta\u2019s own office.\nWhen Gupta decided to leave West Virginia in 2018, Charleston and the surrounding county had fewer than five HIV cases related to IV drug use. Since then the number of new cases has gone up to 85, prompting the CDC to send in a team of disease intervention specialists.\n\u201cThey warned us there was going to be a massive HIV outbreak\u201d, said April, who contracted HIV in Charleston last year from IV drug use and did not want her last name used. \u201cI thought they were just trying to scare us into not using. But they were right.\u201d\nShe added that she and people she had use drugs with didn\u2019t have to share needles when the program was operational. \u201cBut as soon as it shut down, people started selling them just like they did dope.\u201d\nBut beyond the immediate public health crisis prompted by shutting down the state\u2019s largest sterile syringe program, Gupta\u2019s audit\u2019s legacy lives on in the form of new legislation that has made it illegal for harm reduction programs in West Virginia to follow CDC guidelines.\nProponents of the bill held up his report as an example of a public health official advocating for higher thresholds on syringe programs. As a result, three of the 28 counties in West Virginia originally identified as high risk for HIV outbreaks have shut down their syringe programs, citing restrictions placed on their programs by the new law.\nThree years after the KCHD program was decertified by Gupta, people desperate for housing and access to medical supplies are not hard to find on the streets of Charleston. A man named Tommy said clean syringe access has completely dried up since the shutdown of the program.\nHe described how people who are desperate to reuse old needles will use the flint on matchbooks to reshape needles which have been bent from use. He said the current market value for a clean syringe on the streets is about $5. People can get a used one for between $1 and $2.\nSeeing the devastation caused to her state\u2019s public health by people who misunderstand or outright oppose harm reduction over the past few years, Dr Pollini is left with one question over the newly confirmed head of ONDCP: \u201cDoes he have a better understanding of these programs than he did three years ago?\u201d\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the ONDCP said: \u201cAs a practicing physician and former health official, Dr. Gupta has a long history of supporting high-quality, evidence-based services, including harm reduction. Dr. Gupta is strongly committed to advancing the president\u2019s drug policy priorities, including expanding access to prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services across the country, as well as reducing the supply of illicit drugs to address addiction and the overdose epidemic.\u201d",

        "content": "The pandemic has worsened childcare issues in terms of their expense, the low pay for workers and lack of accessibility \nThe high costs and lack of access to childcare is preventing many thousands of women from returning to the workforce in the United States despite a widespread labor shortage.\nChildcare systems in America were already facing significant problems in terms of their expense, the low pay for workers, and lack of accessibility for families before to the pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has worsened these issues as childcare centers were forced to shut down, and many closed permanently, have yet to reopen, or have lowered enrollment.\nJessica Rapp of Westminster, Colorado, gave birth to her first child in August 2020. Her job as a pediatric occupational therapist did not provide any paid maternity leave. She took 12 weeks off, unpaid, through the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\nThe financial difficulties began after she received high medical bills for the birth, even though she had health insurance. Rapp and her husband are still paying off the medical debt, while she has only been able to return to work part-time due to the high costs of childcare. The couple pays about $1,200 a month for two days of care a week.\n\u201cNow my son is 14 months old and I would say the past year has been the most financially stressed we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Rapp. \u201cThe cost of full-time childcare would have been much higher than our mortgage, higher than my salary would have been able to take in.\u201d\nEven with financial support and childcare help from family, Rapp hasn\u2019t been able to return to work full-time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice right now. I feel like I want to work. That should be a good thing, but it\u2019s just not possible now.\u201d\nIn September 2021, more than 300,000 women in the US left the workforce. More than 26,000 jobs were lost in September 2021 for women, while men gained 220,000 jobs. The labor participation rate in the US is still 1.7% lower than before the pandemic in February 2020, including nearly 1.6 million mothers with children under the age of 17 who dropped out of the work force and have not returned.\n\u201cThe care infrastructure was hanging by a thread before the pandemic,\u201d said Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director and CEO of MomsRising. \u201cThen that unraveled altogether and it became clear that we absolutely need to invest in childcare so parents can go to work, children can thrive, and childcare workers can earn living wages. Investing in childcare is job-enabling and job-creating, by allowing parents to go to their much needed jobs, and by investing in a career and better wages for care workers.\u201d\nPresident Biden\u2019s Build Back Better budget reconciliation bill includes $400bn in funds to develop free universal preschool for children ages three and four, and to reduce childcare costs to 7% of income for families earning up to 250% of their state\u2019s median income, which is estimated to expand access for 20 million children in the US.\nCurrently, the United States government spends just $500 annually per child on early childhood care, significantly lower than the average for wealthy countries, at $14,436 in annual public spending.\nChildcare costs for parents have increased significantly over the past few decades and vary widely across the US, from about $5,000 annually in Mississippi to about $24,000 annually in Washington DC. Even before Covid-19, a majority of Americans lived in childcare deserts.\nReshonna Booker of Seattle, Washington, gave birth to her first child in June 2020, while studying to become a teacher. After her few weeks of paid leave during the pandemic expired, Booker had to leave the workforce to care for her son, as childcare was not only too expensive, but every facility she and her husband could find had waiting lists of at least two years.\n\u201cNinety percent of the kids that come in are white, middle class families, and so all those spots get full, and where does that leave all the other people of color to get a quality education?\u201d said Booker. \u201cI think that should be a priority, to change the education gap, to have spots reserved for children of color in better quality schools, especially for young Black children, because we can never get in and they\u2019re too expensive.\u201d\nChildcare workers in the US typically make about $12 an hour.\nThe low pay is a contributing factor in staffing shortages that the majority of childcare facilities in the US are still experiencing after the pandemic.More than 100,000 jobs in the child daycare industry have been lost since the pandemic began.\nAcross the US, more than one in three childcare providers reported in a recent survey they are considering leaving or closing their childcare program.\nLacey Clark started working at Wild Lilac Child Development Community in Portland, Oregon, once the facility reopened after a brief shut-down due to Covid in spring 2020. She had been laid off from a job at another childcare provider due to the pandemic.\n\u201cIt felt like the dark ages,\u201d said Clark. \u201cThe policy landscape was changing, it felt like every week, both our school creating its own policies, the government policies, and then the early childhood policies. It felt like we were really out of control and getting a lot of flack for the policies being made around us.\u201d\nClark and her co-workers recently voted overwhelmingly to unionize after organizing with coworkers through the internet due to Covid safety protocols.\n\u201cWe need to have more staff and to get paid better,\u201d added Clark. \u201cThere\u2019s such a high turnover. Having new people come in with no training for minimum wage and having the highest expectations for them to deliver high quality childcare has caused a massive burnout.\u201d",

During the exchange, officers asked her name and she responded \u201cmy name is Cleo\u201d.\nPolice also released footage from an officer\u2019s body camera showing the moment Cleo was carried out of the house with one of the officers present later describing the four-year-old as having been like \u201ca little Energizer bunny\u201d.\nThe WA premier, Mark McGowan, visited Cleo and her family in Carnarvon on Thursday. He gave the four-year-old two teddy bears named after the officers who rescued her\n\u201cWe did a few high fives. I, unfortunately, trod on her new Barbie shoes and broke one of them. So I owe her a pair of shoes,\u201d McGowan said.\n\u201cIt was a lovely experience to meet that little girl. She\u2019s just bubbly, playing, friendly, sweet. She was eating an icy pole, she spilled it everywhere. She told me it was very, very sticky, which I believed, and she was just delightful,\u201d the premier said.\nWA police do not expect anyone to claim the $1m reward for information about Cleo\u2019s whereabouts that had been offered by the government \u2013 the equal largest reward ever offered by the state.

He had stressed last month that monetary policy \u201cwill have to act\u201d if there is a risk of inflation. Those words were not followed by action on Thursday, despite the rising wages and prices.\nGerard Lyons, a former candidate for governor and a former adviser to Boris Johnson, described the governor\u2019s signalling as \u201cappalling\u201d, adding that by not correcting how the market or the media interpreted his comments he encouraged \u201chawkish expectations ahead of this meeting that was not merited by the recent data\u201d.\nLyons went on to say the bank needed to learn from the US Federal Reserve, \u201cto be on top of the data\u201d and \u201cguide\u201d the market.\nHe is not the only commentator to offer a disparaging comparison of the Bank of England\u2019s public relations to those of the Fed, or the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, where the path of interest rates is clearly mapped out.\nThe decision itself was not unpopular. A rise in interest rates, said one analyst, could push the UK into a recession next year, such is the weakening outlook. GDP growth is slowing, consumer confidence is falling and trade figures are weak following Brexit.\nThe MPC seemed to follow this line of argument in its latest quarterly health check, despite forecasting a rise in inflation to a fresh peak of 5% in the new year.\nWhile monetary policy would have no impact on rising gas prices and a spike in the cost of oil, which were global problems hitting all countries, there were still worries about domestic price pressures, mostly from the cost of labour.\nThe committee had hoped there would be some information indicating how many had joined the dole queue and how many were kept on by their employer; and if they were kept on, was their position still full-time or part-time.\nUnable to divine how strong the outlook is for jobs and wage rises over the longer term, they sat on their hands in the hope of a clearer picture emerging \u201cin the coming months\u201d.\nThis phrase was widely interpreted as meaning an interest rate rise in December or February next year. The downbeat economic forecast meant maybe one or two more rises may follow in 2022.\nMartin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said a base rate of 0.5% in a year was the most the markets can reasonably expect.\nPaul Dales, at the consultancy Capital Economics, summed up the Bank\u2019s position: \u201cSo the MPC is gearing up to raise rates because the economic outlook is stronger than when it cut rates to 0.1% in March 2020 and because it wants to send a signal that it is not going to let inflation stay above the 2% target for very long.\n\u201cBut equally, it is aware that the economy is still fragile and wants to send a signal that it won\u2019t raise rates too far, too soon.\u201d\nSpeculators will feel bruised. However, they should know that the MPC has been here before, talking tough only to concede meekly that the UK economy is essentially weak and in need of ultra-low interest rates to maintain growth.\nIt was how the former governor, Mark Carney, gained his \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d nickname. It may stick to Andrew Bailey too.",

        "content": "The new overnight Eurostar to the Alps is popular for package trips but skiers can now reach plenty of resorts by train from the UK. We round up some of the options\nAs the snowsports travel industry shakes off its Covid chains, rail routes to the mountains are having a surprise renaissance, with more than 60 resorts in France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy now easily accessible from London. And carving up to 90% off a journey\u2019s carbon footprint.\nBut despite snowsport fans\u2019 enthusiasm for flight-free travel to ski resorts (and the extra slope day that can be shoehorned into a holiday compared with a standard seven-day package), the range of rail routes available, especially on sleeper services, has been disappointing. So it\u2019s cheering that, as the ski industry gears up for its first \u201cproper\u201d season in two years, more trains than ever before are running to more than 60 European resorts. Bookings opened this week.\nMuch fanfare accompanied the news in September that Eurostar\u2019s overnight Snow Train to the French Alps is back \u2013 sort of. Rebranded the Travelski Express, the service leaving London St Pancras on Friday evenings and returning during the day on the following Saturday is in fact a partnership with tour operator Travelski, and exclusively for those on its travel/accommodation/ski pass packages, which start at about \u00a3450. This season it serves six resorts, including Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, Les Arcs and Les Menuires, with its first departure on Boxing Day.\nThere are also options for those booking independently or through specialists such as Ffestiniog Travel, Trainseurope and Rail Travel. Nightjet is the name of a growing international network of sleeper routes led by Austria\u2019s national carrier, \u00d6BB, that can be accessed via Eurostar. Travelling through Amsterdam or Brussels, plus a slick German InterCity Express (ICE) to Cologne, they deliver skiers to Salzburg, Zurich and Innsbruck for easy onward hops to numerous resorts. Train travel from London to W\u00f6rgl, a short taxi ride from several good resorts in Austria\u2019s Tyrol, for example, takes about 18 hours, including a night in one of several classes of couchette.\nWhile France\u2019s rail-to-Alps crown slipped with the slashing of sleeper routes in 2016, the efficient SNCF service to Brian\u00e7on (for Serre Chevalier and Montgen\u00e8vre) remains. And 10 December will see the relaunch after three years of an overnight route from Paris to Lourdes for the Pyrenees, whose resorts, although lower and smaller than their Alpine counterparts, are well-loved by many UK downhillers for their authenticity, affordability and uncrowded slopes. The service takes about 10 hours, with couchette berths from \u20ac29 and first-class private compartments available.\nThe choice of TGV routes from Paris and Lille makes easy work of daytime journeys to the Alps. Paris to Chamonix, for example, can be done in five hours, with a scenic change in Saint-Gervais-les-Bains; Morzine is a mere 2\u00bd hours from the French capital (the journey via Eurostar requires a change of station in Paris).\nAnd Belgium\u2019s nippy, well-priced Thalys Snow trains runs every Saturday from Christmas Day to 16 April from Brussels to French Alps hubs, including Albertville, Mo\u00fbtiers, Aime-La-Plagne and Bourg-Saint-Maurice.\n(Best prices at time of publication and most convenient routes from London St Pancras \u2013 Eurostar\u2019s Kent stations will not reopen until after the ski season.

The 09.31 Eurostar reaches Paris Gare du Nord at 12.47, leaving plenty of time to transfer to Gare de Lyon for the 14.18 TGV to Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, arriving 17.00. The next service to Cluses departs 17.15 and arrives 18.52, leaving you a 25-minute cab or bus ride from your destination.\nStation to slopes from 9 hours,  from \u00a3161.93 returnTwo new lifts connecting Val Thorens with the outlying Orelle area are this season\u2019s big story in the 3 Vall\u00e9es, and M\u00e9ribel puts guests at the heart of 600km of diverse terrain.

Road transfers to M\u00e9ribel take about 30 minutes.

        "content": "Press criticism of lobbying scandal is one reason No 10 ditched plan for Tory-led standards panel\nThe usually sympathetic media has rounded on the government for a second day over its handling of sleaze and Owen Paterson, and this time the verdict is even more brutal. It has been reported that the virulence of Thursday\u2019s press criticism was one of the reasons the government so swiftly ditched a proposed new Tory-led standards panel. Following the U-turn and Paterson\u2019s resignation, Friday\u2019s papers make for even more difficult reading for the government, especially for Boris Johnson.\nThe Mail carries a front-page picture of Johnson beside a headline questioning his leadership. The caption reads: \u201cOn day of farce, Tories U-turn on disgraced MP Paterson after public fury \u2026 he quits \u2026 and a nation aghast at Boris\u2019s misjudgment asks \u2026 IS ANYBODY IN CHARGE AT No 10?\u201d\nIt is a much more pointed attack than Thursday\u2019s Mail front page, which tried to blame the whole \u201cpolitical class\u201d for the government attempt to set up a new standard\u2019s panel. \u201cShameless MPs sink back into sleaze\u201d was the confusing headline. But on Friday there is no doubt who the paper is gunning for. Inside, six pages prominently feature senior Tories questioning Johnson\u2019s handling of the debacle.\nOne is quoted as saying: \u201cThe problem with Boris is he packs his cabinet with second-rate people, meaning there is no one to tell him he should take a different course. It all just looks like we\u2019re back to the 1990s \u2013 MPs getting together to support their friends.\u201d\nEven the staunchly loyal Daily Telegraph, which on Thursday carried a sympathetic interview with Paterson, appears to turn on the government. Its front page carries a pull quote from its columnist Fraser Nelson, which says: \u201cArrogance and complacency \u2026 it\u2019s becoming easier to see how the Tories end \u2026\u201d\nThe Telegraph\u2019s front-page headline is \u201cPaterson quits after backlash from MPs.\u201d While the paper\u2019s cartoonist Matt shows Guy Fawkes being caught, saying: \u201cI\u2019m setting up my own standards committee to look into this.\u201d\nIt is worth remembering that on Tuesday Johnson flew from Cop26 on a private jet to attend a Telegraph dinner at the Garrick with the paper\u2019s former editor Charles Moore, a friend and vocal supporter of Paterson.\nThe Times also focuses on how much the government\u2019s mishandling of Paterson\u2019s case has backfired on Johnson. Its front-page headline is \u201cPM faces party backlash after suspension U-turn.\u201d\nIt reports that Tory MPs are angry at being whipped into blocking Paterson\u2019s suspension for breaking lobbying rules by backing a new standards watchdog, only for the government to reverse the plan less than 24 hours later.\n\u201cMPs did what they were told and have been made to look stupid and corrupt,\u201d one backbencher tells the Times.\nThe Financial Times reveals that potential Tory rebels were told they could lose constituency funding if they voted against the now-ditched new standards body. But one is quoted as saying: \u201cAny MP who believed this deserves to have funding removed for being a thick gullible twat.\u201d\nJohnson escapes front-page criticism in the Mirror and the Sun, but not the Star. It depicts Johnson and the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, as clowns called Bozo and Rees-Smugg under a U-turn sign. The headline reads: \u201cWell, we didn\u2019t see that U-turn coming. Said nobody. Ever.\u201d\nOn the inside pages, the Sun reports it was Rees-Mogg who assured Johnson the plan for a new standards body was \u201cwatertight\u201d.\nThe chief whip, Mark Spencer, is also under pressure, according to the Guardian\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. He quotes one MP as saying: \u201cI have never heard ministers go through the lobby, saying out loud, \u2018this is absolute madness\u2019. The chief whip needs to go for this.\u201d\nHe writes:\nOne said she had \u201cbeen flung under a bus for one man\u201d and asked \u201cwas it worth it?\u201d Another, reeling minutes after the U-turn, called it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and criticised \u201chuge party mismanagement\u201d by the whips.",

It has been decided we need a memorial \u2013 a bronze to fall in line with Jack and The Ancient Mariner.\u201d\nDerek had lived among the boats in Watchet marina since being blown into the harbour by a storm and had been fed and looked after by the town\u2019s community ever since.\nScott said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastated the town as I can\u2019t think of anyone who did not know about Derek. When she arrived it was thought she was a boy so she was named Derek but when she had a health check it was discovered he was a she. But we never changed the name.\n\u201cShe was well fed and there was a fund at the marina shop you could give to for food. When I went out in the evening I always had half a Weetabix to tempt her. She got on with everyone, even the boat cat.\u201d\nFlowers have been laid at a temporary memorial created on the Esplanade by Watchet marine staff, which includes a photograph of \u201cthe guardian of the marina\u201d.\nThe goose\u2019s death remains a puzzle. Derek regularly slept on the town\u2019s slipway at low water and an early morning dog-walker reported seeing blood stains and a pile of feathers, though no body has been found.\nChris Moiser, the owner of Tropiquaria zoo in Somerset, was brought in to investigate and confirmed that the feathers and remains were those of a goose. Moiser, a former lawyer, suggested a fox could have done for Derek but said residents would have to be content with an open verdict.",

Everyone knows how highly thought of he is and what he has done as a manager in the game. You have to respect that. We have a manager and a club that believe in us and this appointment definitely shows that.\n\u201cHe definitely brings a lot of passion, a lot of determination, whether that\u2019s on the training pitch or in meetings, in the dressing room. He has won trophies at the highest level with the biggest clubs so everyone is excited to learn, excited to work under him and that passion he shows every day, every meeting, every training session is what you thrive on. You go into games wanting to put your body on the line for him and you can feel that already.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t reached the standards we have wanted to over the last couple of years and we hope that this manager can help us turn it around. But it\u2019s about us and how we take it in because he has done it, he has nothing to prove. He will give us everything he has to improve us and now it is down to us as players to have no excuses. We have to make sure every minute of our lives we are trying to improve and win for this team. That is the only way we are going to move forward.\u201d\nIt has been a difficult start to the club season for Kane on an individual level, with only one goal and one assist in nine Premier League games. His overall numbers have been boosted, however, by six goals and one assist across six Conference League and Carabao Cup ties.\n\u201cI am a player that always believes in myself and always believes in my ability,\u201d Kane said. \u201cI am 28 years old, I have still got a lot to learn, a lot to improve on. It\u2019s not been the start I wanted, the team wanted or the club wanted so we all know that. We all have to take responsibility for that as players.\n\u201cIt is not something I am worried about. I will keep working and I am really excited about working with this manager. I am sure he can improve me and that is an exciting thing. When you have done what I have done in the game so far and still feel like there is more to come, that is definitely exciting so I am looking forward to it.\u201d",

It took nearly 50 years for all four men to have their convictions squashed.\nRidgewell was also behind the conviction of the Stockwell Six, who were accused of attempting to rob on the underground. Two men involved could have convictions overturned.\n\u201cOn behalf of the British Transport Police (BTP), I am sincerely sorry for the trauma suffered by the British African community through the criminal actions of former police officer DS Derek Ridgewell, who worked in BTP during the 1960s and 70s,\u201d D\u2019Orsi wrote.\n\u201cIn particular, it is of regret that we did not act sooner to end his criminalisation of British Africans, which led to the conviction of innocent people. This is simply inexcusable and is something that my colleagues and I are appalled by.\u201d\nThe apology was welcomed by Winston Trew, one of the Oval Four who was wrongfully convicted in 1972 for attempted theft and assaulting police.\n\u201cI welcome the apology from the BTP to the British black community who were targeted with false convictions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a public acknowledgement that something dreadful went wrong in the 1970s.\u201d\nTrew also welcomed the proposal to create a bursary, but disagreed with the suggestion that increasing diversity was the solution going forward. \u201cYou cannot recruit new people into a broken system, the system needs to change, so the public can have confidence in the police and want to become police officers and have a conducive environment to work in. Inclusion is not the solution.\u201d\nThe apology was solicited by Kwaku, a history consultant and historical musicologist, as part of a seminar series he has been running on police and the criminalisation of black British youths. He stipulated the apology should be addressed to the \u201cBritish African community\u201d, a term he said was a more appropriate description of the group than \u201cblack British\u201d.\nKwaku\u2019s approach caused the BTP to further reflect on the criminal actions Ridgewell had taken 45 years ago and the organisation believed it to be a opportunity to set out the chief constable\u2019s position.\n\u201cWe knew that the BTP has issued an apology in each case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we thought it\u2019s not enough to issue an apology to the individual victims, they have to recognise that the British African community was terrorised and have suffered from the trauma caused by these racist cops, from the terror in the 1970s and 80s.\u201d\nThe apology will be read out in a discussion led by Kwaku and Cecil Gutzmore, a black community activist, at the Police and the Criminalising of British African Youths by Numbers Zoom meeting on 8 November.\nA spokesperson for Black Lives Matter UK said: \u201cThis is simply not enough. While the BTP\u2019s proposed bursary will benefit a small number of people, it ultimately doesn\u2019t change the daily discriminatory practices of the force.\u201d\nAccording to a study of official data, young black males in London were 19 times more likely to be stopped and searched than the general population.\n  The spokesperson added: \u201cWhat we need is not more black officers carrying out the same racist harassment and violence against black communities. We need an end to stop and search and we need to create conditions in which black communities can thrive, free from poverty and violence.\u201d",

The charges come amid an investigation by John Durham, who was appointed by the former president to investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nWhat were the allegations?

He\u2019s unsure. \u201cI think we are vastly unknowable unless we meditate 18 hours a day and/or go on mushroom trips to discover all the nooks and crannies of ourselves,\u201d Garfield tells Ryan Gilbey.\nThe CO2 emissions of the world\u2019s richest 1% are set to be 30 times higher than what is compatible with keeping global heating below 1.5C, new research has warned. A group of people smaller in number than the population of Germany are on track to release 70 tonnes of CO2 each per a year \u2013 despite personal emissions needing to fall to an average of 2.3 tonnes by 2030.\nIt all started when Michael Artiaga, then eight, and his older brother Andy, found their dad\u2019s Nintendo Game Boy on a shelf in his closet full of 1970s video games. After the brothers, who learned to code at the age of five, watched the Classic Tetris world championship on YouTube, they were hooked \u2013 and went on to compete against each other for the top prize.\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

        "content": "The photographer has brought directors, door keepers and technicians out of the shadows for a special exhibition celebrating the survival of the West End\nThe backstage heroes of the West End of London have been documented by the photographer Rankin in an exhibition of portraits celebrating the resilience and creative range of the theatre industry. Stage managers, technicians, front of house, wardrobe, wigs, sound design, puppeteers and stage door keepers are among those featuring in Performance, alongside stars, directors and producers.\n\u201cEveryone working in theatre has a story to tell of their experience over the past 18 months, inspiring tales of hardship, perseverance, patience, innovation, despair and joy,\u201d Rankin said. The project, supported by the Society of London Theatre, aimed to \u201ccelebrate the jewel in the crown of our unparalleled culture sector \u2013 epitomised by these countless faces and voices who make up the backbone of London\u2019s theatre community and will spearhead its post-Covid recovery\u201d. Proceeds from Performance will go to the Theatre Artists Fund and London youth homelessness charities.\nWe prepare the costumes and help the actors in and out of them at ridiculous speeds, often in the dark with a head torch. Some productions use a lot of Velcro and poppers, but in Les Mis, there\u2019s a lot of buttons and corsets, and jiggers \u2013 like a male corset \u2013 in the back of trousers and waistcoats.\nYou\u2019re a cog in a giant wheel. It takes every single person to make sure everything runs smoothly. And it gives you adrenaline and excitement \u2013 every night is a brand new experience and the audience will only ever see that one performance. I wish the audience could see what goes on backstage, it\u2019s like a whole show with its own plots in itself.\nI began as a performing magician, but started inventing my own tricks. And in the world of magic, it doesn\u2019t take long before word gets out.\nI develop material, design props, organise the building of the props, coach actors who are not magicians, and deal with the technical requirements of integrating the magic into the set and lighting design.\nThe average member of the public would be shocked if they saw what a complicated machine backstage is, and what extreme precision it takes to run a show. I\u2019m sad the audience can\u2019t see this beautiful ballet unfolding backstage as well as on stage.\nI studied music technology at uni, but I had no idea what to do. A friend working in it said go and look at the theatre business and do some work experience, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\nWe come in a few hours before the cast to do a full soundcheck. We make sure all the microphones, speakers and other equipment are working. During the show, we control how much of the music and how much of the cast you hear.\nNo one really notices until something goes wrong. And then they realise there\u2019s an actual person taking care of the sound. Backstage we are a huge team. We all work to make the show happen.\nI\u2019m the oldest of lots of children and I used to make them put on shows, so I guess I started early. Now there\u2019s no typical day. I might be reading plays or working with designers or mentoring young people. Other times, you\u2019re in rehearsals \u2013 that\u2019s the best bit, the most creative. I always forget how hard a show was the second it finishes.\nLockdown was really tough and we all panicked about how we were going to survive: 70% of our industry are freelancers. But the mad treadmill disappeared \u2013 which would have been liberating if we weren\u2019t so worried about actually eating.\nMy job is to book musicians for West End pit orchestras and then manage them day to day. Now we have all the Covid-related administration to contend with which makes a lot of extra work. The musicians do a lateral flow test daily and if someone tests positive, we have to get someone else in.\nA live orchestra is essential for a show. It\u2019s there to support the stage. Pit orchestras are made up of very good musicians, but they\u2019re different animals to actors. It\u2019s about the music, not the glory.\nMainly, I look after the voices of the children and adults in the cast, teaching them vocal techniques and how to keep up their vocal stamina. Audibility, articulation, clarity, projection, singing techniques. I teach them everything about their voices because they lead our show. Children are sponges, they take on information remarkably quickly, it\u2019s so rewarding.\nPeople think children are magically able to speak on stage, and be heard and understood. But there\u2019s an awful lot that\u2019s happening underneath those ducks swimming on that lake.\nI look after the backstage area, seeing to the needs of the actors and some of the staff, handling mail, looking after keys, making sure there\u2019s good harmony.\nI try not to come into work in a bad mood. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t put on a clown face and perform. But once they step through the stage door, whatever stress they\u2019ve been having, they can be in the right frame of mind to get on with their job and enjoy it.\nI\u2019ve worked in theatre for a very long time \u2013 as a stagehand, and I\u2019ve done box office; I\u2019ve worked in wardrobe. I love working in theatre, and I feel appreciated.\nPerformance is at the Fujifilm House of Photography, London, until 31 January.",

Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United. A new series of Sex and the City. Trucker caps and dresses with peekaboo cutouts. Wait, is it 2021, or 2003?\n The noughties are back. Don\u2019t blame me: this isn\u2019t just a fashion thing \u2013 it is celebrity culture, TV and even football. Also, do not confuse \u201cthe noughties are back\u201d with \u201cthe noughties are cool again\u201d, because the two are quite different. When something is ripe for pop culture nostalgia, that means it is ancient history.\nBeing old enough to remember the actual noughties does not make you any kind of oracle on the noughties revival, because our memories are not the point here. The generation leading this particular revival are reliving memories of their own \u2013 childhood ones of their mums picking them up from school in Juicy Couture tracksuits, or of the formative night they came downstairs in their jimjams and saw Christina Aguilera in chaps on late night MTV. \u201cI was there\u201d doesn\u2019t make you hip, it just makes you old.\n  Were the noughties actually any good, though? Do they warrant a revival? The gold-script name necklaces were solid, to be fair. But if there is glory in cargo pants and Ugg boots, it is as holy relics of the last days of a life that wasn\u2019t ruled by phones and social media. The noughties are the bridge between the pre-internet era, and the life we live now.\nI remember the day the Guardian gave me a BlackBerry \u2013 Google it, kids! \u2013 and I walked down the street clicking out emails on my little keypad and, wow, I mean as far as I was concerned I was literally Hillary Clinton. Look at me! I\u2019m so busy. I\u2019m so important! Funny to think that after all the panic about the millennium bug, when New Year\u2019s Day dawned in 2000 and the clocks were still ticking and the aeroplanes hadn\u2019t fallen out of the sky, we thought that Y2K had been a false alarm and embedding technology into the frontal cortex of our brains hadn\u2019t destroyed civilisation after all.\nTwo decades later, it feels more and more as if the Y2K doomsayers had a point. Technology did kind of crash our culture; it just didn\u2019t happen on the stroke of midnight.\nNoughties fashion is not an easy look to wear as an adult. I don\u2019t plan my outfits around my bedazzled belly button ring, and I\u2019m guessing that you don\u2019t either. Oh, and the colours! All bubblegum pinks and mermaid aquas, like a six-year-old girl\u2019s bedroom.\nBut there are some nice bits we can cherry-pick. Gucci designer Alessandro Michele told me recently that he thought Tom Ford\u2019s era at the house, which ended in 2004, was \u201cmagical\u201d. All slouchy trousers and corset tops, pencil skirts and silk trenchcoats, those clothes look like the 90s, but hotter. (Don\u2019t take my word for it: TikTok superstar Addison Rae wore 2003 Tom Ford for Gucci to the Met Gala this year.) And I\u2019m willing to overlook the decade\u2019s hideous frameless sunglasses if it means a green light to spaghetti-strap vest tops, which I still prefer to T-shirts, if I\u2019m honest, despite camisoles having been unfashionable for two decades.\nWhat\u2019s more, the noughties gave good handbag. The Dior Saddle bag, introduced in 2000, was lightweight enough to slot neatly between your arm and your ribcage. In a cashless age of travelling light, maybe we can swap the super-practical cross-body for an old-school shoulder bag. You know, next time.",

        "content": "Although his star status was rooted in talent and solid achievement, on the musical stage, in revue and in television light entertainment, Lionel Blair, who has died aged 92, was one of the first media celebrities famous for being sort of famous. He played up roguishly to his image of a bouffant-haired, perma-tanned dancer, impossible to send up in any meaningful way because he was sending himself up, on gameshows in the 1980s (Give Us a Clue, Blankety Blank) and reality shows in the new century (Celebrity Big Brother).\nBlair was a genuine hoofer and a superb choreographer, who performed a scintillating dance routine with his friend and idol Sammy Davis Jr at the 1961 Royal Variety show and directed one of Danny La Rue\u2019s most lavish spectaculars at the Palace theatre in 1970. He was quick on his feet and witty in speech, and audiences loved his unique brand of extravagant ingratiation, even if the critics sometimes squirmed.\nEndearingly, he owned up to having lied about his age in his autobiography (he shaved off four years), on the daytime chatshow Loose Women in 2016. But in 2010, as one of six oldie celebs on the BBC reality show The Young Ones \u2013 along with Sylvia Syms (with whom he had appeared as a dancing sailor in the 1960 movie The World of Suzie Wong), the newsreader Kenneth Kendall, cricket umpire Dickie Bird, actor Liz Smith and Fleet Street editor Derek Jameson \u2013 he was easily the most agile and youthful.\nHe was born Henry Lionel Blair Ogus, in Montreal, Canada, where his parents \u2013 of Russian and Polish extraction \u2013 had emigrated from the East End of London in 1926. In 1930, the family returned to Hackney before settling in Stamford Hill, north London. Lionel\u2019s father, Myer Ogus, was a barber; his mother, Deborah (\u201cDella\u201d, nee Greenbaum), was a tailor. Lionel very much cared about his hair and his clothes all his life (and his legs were once insured for half a million pounds, a sum then comparable to the $1m quoted \u2013 admittedly two decades earlier \u2013 to cover Betty Grable\u2019s pins).\nHe was educated at Craven Park school \u2013 where he first met his lifelong friends Mike and Bernie Winters, the comedians \u2013 and Egerton Road school, connected to a synagogue. During the war years, he and his younger sister, Joyce \u2013 a budding Fred and Adele Astaire sibling song-and-dance act who were soon billed as \u201cEngland\u2019s youngest swingsters\u201d \u2013 entertained Londoners in the air raid shelters at Manor House station on the Piccadilly line.\nLionel made a professional debut as a munchkin in The Wizard of Oz at the Grand, Croydon, in 1942, shortly after that theatre reopened following the heavy bombing of Croydon earlier in the war. In 1943, he was one of the children in the post-West End tour of Lillian Hellman\u2019s Watch on the Rhine, a powerful anti-Nazi play, and made a West End debut in 1944 in Flying Colours, a revue starring Binnie Hale and Douglas Byng.\nIn the same year, he joined the Memorial theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon to play five roles in the summer season directed by Robert Atkins, including Macduff\u2019s son in Macbeth; Gregory in The Taming of the Shrew; and third player in Hamlet. After a season in rep in Belfast there was a short run in RF Delderfield\u2019s cosy comedy Peace Comes to Peckham. When his father died in 1947, Lionel became the family breadwinner \u2013 Joyce was just starting at a dance school \u2013 and decided to change his surname and concentrate on dancing as a more likely way of maintaining a regular income of sorts.\nThis he did, as a waiter, in Bob\u2019s Your Uncle (1948) at the Saville, a musical comedy vehicle for Leslie Henson with a score by Noel Gay, then on the touring production of Annie Get Your Gun and in Kiss Me, Kate at the Coliseum in 1951. By the mid-1950s he was choreographing the celebrated Five Past Eight shows, swishly staged by Dick Hurran at the Alhambra, Glasgow, with headline stars such as Jimmy Logan, Eve Boswell and Stanley Baxter, and this led to his pre-eminence on BBC television in the 1960s, choreographing and dancing with his own group of show girls.\nIn that same period, he choreographed several movies and appeared in Michael Winner\u2019s The Cool Mikado (1963) with Frankie Howerd and Stubby Kaye, and in Richard Lester\u2019s A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964) with the Beatles. He was a regular in the biggest London pantomimes, commanding a fee of \u00a315,000 a week as Buttons, Dick Whittington, Jack on his beanstalk and Aladdin.\nBut he was really now subsumed in his television work, and his last \u201clegit\u201d West End stage appearances included a cheerful 1968 revival of the Gershwins\u2019 Lady Be Good at the Saville, partnering the self-parodying squeaky \u201cblond bombshell\u201d Aimi MacDonald (who had won television prominence in At Last the 1948 Show with John Cleese and Marty Feldman); and critically acclaimed \u201cturns\u201d as the Player King in a touring production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at the Piccadilly in 1987 and as the oleaginous compere of Pageant (like Liberace on speed, said Sheridan Morley) at the Vaudeville in 2000. He also toured with Jimmy Edwards in Doctor in the House in 1978.\nOn Give Us a Clue (1979-92), he and Una Stubbs captained teams competing in charades. On Name That Tune, which had been running in some shape or form since being imported from the US in 1956, he took over as presenter from Tom O\u2019Connor from 1983 until 1988. And he filled in missing words on Blankety Blank during the best years of that show, with Les Dawson chaotically and uninterestedly in charge. This extensive warmup as a self-mocking celeb made Blair a prime candidate for reality shows, and he started mucking out down on The Farm on Channel 5 in 2005.\nOn a Christmas special of Extras by and with Ricky Gervais in 2007, Blair paid the ultimate humiliating price for self-preservation with a needy plea to extend his career on Celebrity Big Brother; and this eventually came to pass in 2014 (he was the third house guest to be evicted). In the same year, on the BBC drama Doctors, he played an old actor stricken with Alzheimer\u2019s disease; this, he said, was a move to escape being Lionel Blair. He made another bid for freedom on Emmerdale in 2014.\nBlair was involved in a variety of charity work, including for the organisations Stage for Age and Age UK. Latterly, he occasionally dusted down a one-man show, Tap and Chat, for the delectation of his loyal fans.\nFor many years he lived in Surrey with his wife, Susan Davis, whom he married in 1967. He is survived by Susan, their daughter, Lucy, two sons, David and Matthew, and three grandchildren. His sister, Joyce, a well-known performer in her own right, died in 2006.\n Lionel Blair (Henry Lionel Blair Ogus), actor, dancer and choreographer, born 12 December 1928; died 4 November 2021",

There are some really decent people in the new intake and they shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted.\u201d\nAnother confessed they were \u201cso tired of crying\u201d and had been racked with frustration at having to protect Paterson.\nOthers complained about \u201ctaking shit for another man I\u2019ve never met, after Dominic Cummings\u201d, and being \u201chung out to dry to protect someone who wouldn\u2019t even recognise me in the corridor\u201d.\nFew new Tories have spoken out publicly. But one, Aaron Bell, the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, said in the Commons debate on the issue this week that he would vote against the government-backed amendment, claiming it \u201cmakes it looks like we\u2019re moving the goalposts\u201d by changing the rules specially for Paterson.\nA minister noted that many of the latest intake were \u201cquite bolshie\u201d already, and it would not have helped the party by pushing them away even further.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been put through a process where they had to take one for the team and the whole thing exploded less than 24 hours later,\u201d they said. \u201cThere are so many quick U-turns, it would almost be better if there was some material damage.\n\u201cIf we actually dropped significantly and for a sustained period in the polls, it might make the powers that be deal with this issue. The approach now seems to be \u2018we dodged another bullet there lads, let\u2019s wait and see what the next one is\u2019.\u201d\nEyebrows have also been raised at Angela Richardson, who became the MP for Guildford in 2019, losing her job as a parliamentary private secretary (PPS) in Michael Gove\u2019s levelling up department for abstaining on the amendment to spare Paterson\u2019s suspension, only to be reinstated the following day when the government reversed course.\nA Tory aide said the move could encourage other PPSs to rebel against three-line whips, given their excuse would be \u201cwell, we thought there would be a U-turn\u201d.",

Bobiev, a blogger from Tajikistan, was also ordered to be deported from Russia.\nOther women have been detained for flashing their buttocks or breasts in front of public landmarks or police stations in various cities including St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg in cases that stretch back to August. Several of those investigated said they were not responsible for the material being put online.\nThe cases, which have often been pursued by conservative activists who have complained to the police, mark another step forward in the policing of social networks and the willingness of the authorities to use severe punishments against apolitical Instagram stars and influencers.\nWhile a judge chose to jail two members of the punk protest group Pussy Riot in 2012 for two years after a performance in a Moscow cathedral, many of the recent cases are far less politicised, and appear to be driven by greater attention to Instagram accounts used by ordinary Russians.\nOne woman, an adult actress and model on OnlyFans, said she was a \u201cpatriot\u201d after she was sentenced to 14 days behind bars for a picture showing her buttocks near the Kremlin walls. Another, who was briefly jailed for a similar photograph in front of St Isaac\u2019s Cathedral in St Petersburg, was only released because she had a school-aged son.\nOn Friday, a model publicly apologised after reports that an investigation was opened over a three-year-old photograph with her kissing another woman in front of the \u201ceternal flame\u201d near the Kremlin walls. The flame is a monument dedicated to Soviet dead in the second world war.\n\u201cPlease accept my honest apologies for the video that was created three years ago,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was made without the goal to offend or defile.\u201d",

        "content": "Crystal Palace defender on his childhood and beating timekeeping issues and Brentford\u2019s academy closure to reach the top\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like a whirlwind,\u201d says Tyrick Mitchell. The Crystal Palace defender is reflecting on life under Patrick Vieira a few days after he was part of the side that defeated the champions, Manchester City, on their home patch, although the 22-year-old could easily be talking about his own career.\nAs a youngster Mitchell had trials with Watford but struggled with attendance because his absent father was in and out of prison, leaving his mother to survive on benefits. His dream of becoming a professional looked doomed when Brentford closed their academy in May 2016 \u2013 two months after he had signed his first contract. Now firmly established as Palace\u2019s first-choice left-back, he has started every Premier League match since Vieira succeeded Roy Hodgson in the summer and insists he never lost faith in his ability.\n\u201cI always had a plan that somehow I\u2019ve got to \u2026 I had tunnel vision,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was nothing going to stop me. Sometimes you detour and don\u2019t focus as much but I always make sure that no one is going to influence me or put me on the wrong track to not succeed. It hasn\u2019t been the easiest of routes but that\u2019s what makes everything more special and humbling to me. It came from nothing and it wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 I think that is a big part of the person I am today. I try to stay humble and cherish every moment.\u201d\nMitchell grew up with his mother and sister in Harrow, north-west London, and has had only sporadic contact with his father.\n\u201cIt was difficult and for a lot of people around me in the area it was probably the same,\u201d he says. \u201cThe single-parent aspect was massive for me. I feel like it made me a better person. I didn\u2019t take anything for granted. It gave me that pride where now I am in a position where I can help the people around me, and no one has to worry about anything.\n\u201cThat whole scenario built me into a man so much quicker. Sometimes when you have two parents, or when you are given everything you want, you are kind of shielded from the real world. Now when I enter the real world, and you don\u2019t get everything you want or you have to work even harder, I am able to do that with ease.\u201d\nMitchell was first spotted playing for local club Pinner Albion and failed a trial with Watford\u2019s Under-10s before joining AFC Wembley. The coach Abdi Farah, his mentor and now agent, took Mitchell under his wing after growing concerned because the young defender kept missing training sessions. Mitchell credits the influence of Farah and the coaches at Brentford\u2019s academy for making him realise how much dedication would be required.\n\u201cThey helped me getting to training and staying focused on my dream. They played a massive role in getting me to where I am today. Obviously as a young person you love playing football but when you\u2019re younger the whole professional aspect is hard to grasp. Like being punctual and things like that. It\u2019s not like just going outside and kicking a ball with your friends.\n\u201cSometimes I felt like I sacrificed the professional side to just be a kid and stay out late with my friends. I didn\u2019t really understand what football could be at that time. But the rest of the coaches told me: \u2018You have a real chance here \u2013 don\u2019t throw it away \u2026\u2019 It\u2019s not always about having fun \u2013 sometimes you have to be professional and they helped me understand that.\u201d\nYet Brentford\u2019s controversial decision to close their academy to focus on their \u201cB\u201d side playing top opposition in friendlies left Mitchell and many others out in the cold.\n\u201cI felt that was all I knew growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like a family, so when it closed, suddenly I was just a school pupil and not someone who was at an academy. That was one of the hardest parts but I never try to get ahead of myself. A lot of people like my friends helped me to move on and recognise that there was going to be another opportunity and to make sure I was ready to take it.\u201d\nWhen that came in the form of an offer from Palace, Mitchell did not hesitate, despite interest from other clubs. Two days after Alan Pardew\u2019s side had lost the 2016 FA Cup final against Manchester United, he met Palace\u2019s academy director, Gary Issott, at the hotel where the squad had held their post-match party.\n\u201cFrom the first meeting with Gary, there was a plan,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cIt was like: \u2018We have these people in front of you; this person might go and this person will stay.\u2019 I prefer someone to tell me how it is \u2013 tell me that I\u2019ve got to get past this player. I feel like I\u2019m a good judge of character and sometimes when people speak you feel their energy and believe what they are saying. That was the kind of vibe that I got with Gary and here we are today.\u201d\nIt is a measure of the esteem Mitchell is held in at Palace that the experienced Patrick van Aanholt was allowed to depart in the summer and no left-back was brought in by Vieira. After becoming Palace\u2019s youngest Premier League goalscorer for 23 years at the end of last season against Aston Villa, he has continued that form with an assist in the draw against Newcastle and is top of the Premier League\u2019s successful tackles chart.\n\u201cPatrick was a great left-back and when he was here I learned a lot off him,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the confidence the club and manager have put in me has made me want to repay them and show that they were right.\u201d\nMitchell has yet to take the opportunity to pick his manager\u2019s brains about one of his heroes, however. Ashley Cole played at left-back for Palace on loan before going on to be part of the Arsenal \u201cInvincibles\u201d side captained by Vieira.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really asked about Ashley Cole,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cI class Ashley Cole as a Chelsea player, so I don\u2019t really remember his Arsenal time. But that\u2019s a good point, I am going to do that!\u201d\nA picture of Mitchell was proudly included alongside other youth-team products such as Gareth Southgate, Wilfried Zaha and Aaron Wan-Bissaka as part of a mural outside Palace\u2019s new academy that was officially opened last week by the England manager. The next stage of development at the \u00a320m state-of-the-art facility in one of the country\u2019s talent hotspots is about to begin and their latest homegrown star is expecting plenty more to follow in his footsteps as a result.\n\u201cI think there is going to be a massive production of players coming through,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nothing you can\u2019t get at Palace that you will get at another club. It\u2019s crazy. I won\u2019t be surprised if the whole of the south play for Palace.\u201d",

        "content": "Two Ofsted inspectors voice their fears for vulnerable children being educated in unregulated facilities\nSome vulnerable children excluded from mainstream schooling are being educated in unregulated and illegal schools based in caravans on farmland, and on industrial estates and business parks, Ofsted inspectors have told the Guardian in an attempt to lift the lid on a murky world.\nVictor Shafiee and Sue Will, who focus on unregistered and illegal schools brought to the inspectorate\u2019s attention through referrals from a worried parent or local authority, say alternative provision (AP) for children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education is complex and growing.\nFor children struggling in mainstream schools there are high-quality state-funded pupil referral units and good independent alternative provision, registered and monitored by Ofsted, that can offer a good short-term fix.\nBut because of a shortage of places, there is also a growing unregistered sector, which is what concerns Ofsted. If an AP offers part-time provision, it is not required to register and so will not be inspected by Ofsted. It becomes illegal if it is not registered yet is offering full-time or near full-time education.\nThe landscape becomes even murkier when children who have been excluded are referred to over-subscribed pupil referral units. They may then be subcontracted to an unregistered setting. It means troubled and challenging children, some as young as five, are being sent to \u201cschools\u201d in unsuitable accommodation, with unqualified staff, and may be receiving little in the way of education.\nFive- and six-year-olds may be placed alongside older teenagers, with no specialist provision for either. The inspectors described how a 14-year-old boy with zero interest in hair and beauty was placed in a setting specialising in hair and beauty. Children roll up at 11am and there may be no staff checks, no curriculum oversight, no data.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Shafiee, Ofsted\u2019s deputy director of unregistered and independent schools. \u201cThe big question for me is: what\u2019s happened out there? Have children suddenly got worse behaved? What is it that\u2019s fundamentally changed that means more children are going to APs, and primary kids are increasingly going to APs? Because this area is so obscure we just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nInspectors are also seeing a growth in online APs, which can in some circumstances be helpful, though not always. \u201cA child is having behavioural problems. What do we do? We ask them to sit in front of a computer and go on to an online AP,\u201d said Shafiee.\nAnd a lot of money is changing hands. If a child has an education, health and care plan for severe special needs, large sums of money can follow that child, with annual fees of \u00a330,000 or even more being paid by local authorities to private providers.\n\u201cWhy have we got ourselves into a situation where some of the most vulnerable children are being cared for or educated by people that probably aren\u2019t as qualified as normal teachers?\u201d said Shafiee. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to them? If at a very young age you end up in an illegal or unregistered AP, what are your chances?\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you hand on heart that this child is going to be returned back to school very quickly, he or she is going to behave much better and life is going to be all roses. There\u2019s a lack of data about how many of these children end up back in mainstream or how many end up in the judicial system. Isn\u2019t that a bad place to be? We just don\u2019t know how many of our children go to these places. Forgive me if I sound really emotional about it.\u201d\nWill is one of a small team of Ofsted inspectors who since 2016 have been going out to unregistered and illegal settings across the country. \u201cI\u2019ve been to settings in caravans on farmland, we\u2019ve been to grubby halls, another favourite is on industrial estates,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe have started to identify more primary children at these settings in the last 18 months, but that\u2019s not to say they weren\u2019t there before. We\u2019re really working in the dark here. There\u2019s no regulation. There\u2019s no requirement for paperwork. It really is the unknown.\u201d\nShe has come across children as young as five in these settings. \u201cYou imagine a five-year-old being written off. At five,\u201d said Will. Shafiee added: \u201cThey deserve the system to help them as much as any other child.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThere is a place for alternative provision in the system, taking a child that\u2019s having problems out of a particular environment, giving him a short break, a different outlook helps them to calm down, to get themselves sorted. We can\u2019t have these children disrupting hundreds of children\u2019s education at the same time either.\n\u201cBut writing them off, or parking them somewhere is not the answer. It\u2019s not fair to them and it\u2019s not fair to the taxpayer who pays for it and it\u2019s not fair to their parents or the society at large.\u201d",

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nClassroom blackboards, pavement hopscotch, goalposts and cricket wickets drawn on walls \u2026 there\u2019s something very English about chalk. But there\u2019s also something very chalky about England: from the south coast\u2019s white cliffs via the North and South Downs, Chilterns and Lincolnshire hills, much of the country sits atop this white rock formed from traces of millions of tiny lives from millions of years ago.\nChalk landscapes of rolling hills, open plateaux and dry valleys may feel quintessentially English, but when it comes to walking destinations, they\u2019re often ignored, the glory all going to more dramatic geology \u2013 limestone, granite, sandstone. This is particularly so in Yorkshire, where hikers flock to the Dales, Pennines and austere North York Moors. But south and east of there \u2013 more accessible for many by train or road \u2013 lie the Yorkshire Wolds, the final section of England\u2019s great chalk slab, running in a curve from the Humber north to the coast at Filey. (There are train stations at both ends.)\nThere\u2019s been a waymarked national trail along its 79 miles for 40 years, and in-the-know walkers have long enjoyed its downs, dry valleys, historic villages and ancient woods. And though the route never got the attention of other Yorkshire trails, that may soon change: this summer the Yorkshire Wolds became one of four new candidates for Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty status.\nThose with a week to spare can walk the Wolds Way in six stages of between 8\u00bd and 17 miles, but a circular hike from the village of South Cave makes an excellent day walk, and its Fox & Coney pub an excellent base.\nWhile the Wolds may be about to enjoy their day in the sun, South Cave has settled into snoozy shadow \u2013 its days of striving and thriving long past. At the end of the 18th century it was a prosperous corn town, with a daily coach from Hull. The railways put an end to its glory, but South Cave is still a proper community, with a school and library, plus two pubs, a chemist and a grocer\u2019s on mainly 18th-century Market Place.\nIts proud, bell-towered 1796 town hall now houses the parish council.\nFrom the Fox, turn left into Beverley Road and catch a first glimpse of the morning light on the Wolds\u2019 high tops. Turn left again into Little Wold Lane and follow this as it becomes a stony track and starts to climb, soon joining the Wolds Way.\nIf you spent last lockdown trudging across spaces turned to quagmires by an increase in footfall, note that on chalk hills, water drains quickly, leaving footpaths passable and most valleys dry in all but the wettest winters.\nThe Humber, with its mudbanks and refineries, is an unlikely beauty spot, but on a bright autumn day I doubt England has anything more fair than the view from this steep path, the sun turning the estuary silver and lighting the wide spaces of Lincolnshire beyond. There were sloes and elderberries in the hedgerows and goldcrests \u201cpip-pipping\u201d as we walked. I grew up 10 miles east of here, in flat-as-flat Hull, and was astonished at this green and delightful land.\nThere was a similar surprise further on at Little Wold Vineyard (tour with tasting \u00a320pp; samples are generous so maybe book for a different day).\n\u201cI was growing spuds 10 years ago,\u201d said Tom Wilson, with the slightly dazed air of a man enjoying unexpected success. The farm has been in his family 75 years, and was always \u201cdifficult\u201d \u2013 chalk hillsides are too steep for a combine harvester. But as oenophiles know, chalk is as perfect a match for wine as cheese: the soil encourages acidity in the fruit, and the vines\u2019 roots easily penetrate the rock, while never suffering \u201cwet feet\u201d.\nIn 2012, Tom\u2019s father Henry planted 2,000 vines \u2013 by hand, with a spade, using a German variety that can cope with Yorkshire weather. By 2016 they were producing 2,500 bottles of white, ros\u00e9 and sparkling, and winning medals. We were impressed with their Barley Hill white, fruity with a nice dry bite; their best-seller, a red called Three Cocked Hat, was sadly sold out.\nBeyond the vineyard, turn left at a fingerpost to drop down to the first of the dry valleys, deep-cut Coomber Dale, before the trail turns right into Weedley Dale, following a disused railway line, then left into wooded East Dale, with a steep climb at the end into sunlight. There was sheep\u2019s wool caught on gnarled hawthorn bushes, and red kites circled overhead. The top is all of 160 metres above sea level, but feels high, with wind turbines and the High Hunsley radio mast making the most of the altitude.\nJust before the B1230, turn left and walk inside the hedge to another footpath sign. This leads left along the edge of Austin\u2019s Dale until it crosses Drewton Beck, with its noisy mallards, where you turn right to walk through the Drewton Estate. If you\u2019ve worked up an appetite, its Farm Shop and Kitchen offers cooking to satisfy the most demanding hiker: specials might include local pork chop with r\u00f6sti, wild mushroom and crispy poached egg, or butter-roasted halibut with samphire.\nFrom here you can head back along Drewton Dale and rejoin the Wolds Way at Coomber Dale, but lunch may have given you energy for a three-mile loop through sleepier North Cave. Turn left along the A1034\u2019s broad verge then right on to a well-maintained footpath leading to Drewton\u2019s Farm and the William\u2019s Den family attraction. As you enter North Cave, feast your eyes on the honey-coloured buildings and dovecote of Manor Farm, then head on to 850-year-old All Saints church, with a trout stream through its churchyard.\nIf you can resist the village\u2019s White Hart free house, head left on a path just past the church to join a lane through the hamlet of Everthorpe. Past its old stone cottages and a venerable oak with circular bench, a lichened footpath sign points across fields and through a kissing gate to the golf course of Cave Castle \u2013 once lived in by George Washington\u2019s great-grandfather. (There\u2019s a public right of way across the course, but it\u2019s not as well signposted as the rest of this walk.) Push on past fairways to South Cave church, also All Saints, and back to Market Place.\nAn inn since 1731, the Fox & Coney had become \u201ca bit grotty\u201d, according to the locally born barmaid. Sam Carroll and Michael Ashton, owners of the Triton Inn \u2013 a destination pub a couple of miles away in Brantingham \u2013 took over and reopened it in 2017, ditching the grotty without losing atmosphere. Real ales in the flagstoned bar include Sleck Dust (\u201csleck the dust\u201d means quench your thirst around here) from Great Newsome brewery. The dimly lit, wood-floored restaurant feels cosy and welcoming, as does the unchallenging but carefully done menu of pies, burgers and fish. Dawdling walkers should note that its Sunday roasts usually sell out by 5pm.\nFive new rooms in former stables take the total to 10. The best ones have sash windows over Market Place, and all come in 50 shades of F&B-style greys/greens/blues. Shower rooms are sleek and spacious; amenities include coffee machine, iron and ironing board. A furry throw on the big bed could be welcome when a northeasterly blows.

The court left a \u20ac400 (\u00a3343) fine unchanged.\nMawda Shari was shot in the face in May 2018 while she sat on her mother\u2019s lap in a van full of people that was being chased by Belgian police on a motorway near Mons. The Shari family from Kurdistan were attempting to reach the UK with Mawda and their three-year old son.\nThe officer was found by the court to have used his firearm \u201cinappropriately\u201d during the pursuit of the Peugeot Boxer van, which was carrying 26 adults and four children. The officer shot into the vehicle while it was travelling at 90km/h, after a 60km chase.\nIn his defence, the officer said he intended to shoot out a tyre, but his car swerved sharply, causing the misfire. He was said to be disconsolate after the shooting. At the original trial, the court said using a gun to immobilise a car was a disproportionate use of force that endangered the lives of the passengers and other road users.\nThe appeal court verdict restated that police could only use their weapons in \u201cextreme cases\u201d in line with Belgian law.\nIn separate proceedings this year, the van\u2019s driver was sentenced to four years in prison and another suspected people smuggler was acquitted.\nMawda\u2019s death became emblematic of the struggles of people from war-torn countries in the Middle East desperately searching for a better life in Europe. Before beginning their journey, the family had already had asylum applications refused and been deported from several European countries, including Britain and Germany, where Mawda was born.\nThe family have since been given indefinite leave to remain in Belgium.\nAfter the appeal court verdict on Thursday, Mawda\u2019s parents and their lawyers called for a parliamentary inquiry. Through a statement issued by the group Justice4Mawda, they said they were satisfied that the facts \u201cat the very least are not minimised\u201d but questions remained about the \u201cnumerous dysfunctions\u201d of the original police investigation.\nShortly after the shooting, a lawyer for the family accused police of dismissing the case as an accidental death and failing to interview witnesses and suspects quickly enough.\nMawda died without her parents being allowed in the ambulance. The couple were informed of their daughter\u2019s death hours later while sitting in police cells.",

Opponents are especially furious as it was the reference to gender identity that in effect led to the senate, or upper house of parliament, last week rejecting a bill aimed at fighting homophobia. \u201cIt\u2019s a measure that was introduced treacherously,\u201d said Malan.\nAndrea Bertoli, another senator with Brothers of Italy, said the \u201cshameful\u201d anti-homophobia law had been \u201creproduced in a transport decree\u201d.\nThe measure also provoked a chorus of complaints from anti-abortion groups, as, by extension, it will prevent them from plastering the streets with billboards that are offensive to women who have had abortions. The ProVita association regularly rolls out aggressive anti-abortion campaigns across the country, placing huge posters on walls featuring foetuses in the womb or those which have equated taking the abortion pill to consuming poison.\n\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t specifically refer to abortion but it widens the measure in a very intelligent way, meaning there will be action taken to block this kind of publicity,\u201d said Luisa Rizzitelli, a women\u2019s rights activist.\nAbortion has been legal in Italy since 1978 and so the law will ban advertisements that infringe upon this right and attack women for having an abortion, added Rizzitelli.\nAntonio Brandi, the president of ProVita, also took aim at the gender identity element of the law. He said: \u201cWill it still be possible to affirm in an advertisement that baby boys are male and baby girls are female? That a baby is born to a mother and father?\u201d\nRizzitelli said the measure was \u201ca great step forward\u201d in banning sexist publicity \u201cwhich is everywhere across Italy\u201d.\n\u201cThe big brands have become much more attentive but in smaller towns we still find adverts which are offensive to the dignity of women,\u201d she added.\nThere was an outcry in January over a street billboard in Lizzanello, a town in Puglia, depicting a woman dressed as a French maid offering cleaning services \u201cfree for a month\u201d. Food and beverage adverts have often featured women wearing only underwear, while in 2017 the jewellery chain Pandora was forced to scrap a pre-Christmas series of ads asking if women would prefer \u201can iron, pyjamas, an apron or a bracelet\u201d as a gift.\n\u201cAll the women\u2019s associations have been trying for years to stop this,\u201d said Rizzitelli. \u201cThis law could help to bring about a cultural change too.\u201d\nThe amendment to the transport and infrastructure decree was introduced by Alessia Rotta, a deputy with the centre-left Democratic party, and Raffaella Paita from the centrist Italia Viva party. \u201cThe amendment is the result of a lot of hard work that allows us to give a social value to these issues,\u201d she said.\nNadia Rossi, a politician with the Democratic party, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a first step towards a definitive stop to hateful messages that are conveyed through advertising. It is not in any way about limiting communication, but of realising how much advertising can influence the thinking of young people, and affect minorities and the most vulnerable.\u201d\nThe divisive anti-homophobia law was blocked by the senate after months of protests by far-right and Catholic groups, arguing it would have suppressed freedom of expression and promoted \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d in schools.",

It came hours after Johnson withdrew his support for moves to shield Paterson from punishment for lobbying on behalf of two companies who paid him more than \u00a3100,000 a year between them.\nMPs had been due on Wednesday to vote on Paterson\u2019s 30-day Commons suspension for what the standards committee called an \u201cegregious case\u201d of breaching lobbying rules. But instead Downing Street backed an amendment suspending the punishment and creating a new standards body with a built-in Tory majority.\nFollowing an outcry over perceived corruption, and disquiet among many Tory MPs, Johnson U-turned on Thursday, prompting Paterson, who has never accepted any wrongdoing, to resign as MP for North Shropshire.\nAsked about reports the disgraced MP could be made a peer, Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the speculation on that.

        "content": "Route to resignation was marked out more than two years ago following a Guardian investigation\nThe route to Owen Paterson\u2019s resignation on Thursday afternoon was marked out more than two years ago, when in 2019 the Guardian exposed his lobbying on behalf of two companies from whom he has received at least \u00a3500,000 in payments.\nDocuments released following freedom of information requests revealed that the MP had repeatedly demanded access to ministers and regulators on behalf of his paying clients. This raised the question of whether he had broken parliamentary rules that prohibit MPs from undertaking paid advocacy\u2013 rules that have existed in various forms since the 17th century.\nThe Guardian evidence led the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, to start her own investigation. That resulted in last week\u2019s damning report from the cross-party Commons committee on standards. It concluded that Paterson\u2019s 14 approaches to ministers and public officials were an \u201cegregious\u201d case and that he had brought parliament in to disrepute.\nIn 2018 the Guardian began making inquiries about a little-known company called UK 2020 that Paterson had formed in 2014 after he lost his ministerial post as environment secretary. He described it as a Conservative thinktank. Funded by donations from private entities, it published occasional reports on issues including the environment and the NHS.\nBut it also began donating thousands of pounds to Paterson, its sole director. Between 2014 and 2019 it donated almost \u00a340,000 to fund various overseas trips by him.\nMPs are required to declare the identities of their political donors in the register of members\u2019 financial interests. Paterson only ever declared his thinktank as the donor in the parliamentary register, so the original source of the thousands of pounds funding him was in effect hidden from the public.\nFollowing the Guardian article, the Labour party demanded that the standards commissioner investigate the true source of the funds, but this apparent bypassing of the rules did not form a part of her later investigation. Paterson closed the thinktank down in October 2019.\nThe Guardian was able to identify just two donors to UK 2020. The first was a trade association representing agrochemical manufacturers, which paid for UK 2020 to host panels at Conservative party conferences in 2015 and 2016. The second was the Northern Irish clinical diagnostics company Randox Laboratories, which sponsored a 2016 report from Paterson\u2019s thinktank criticising the outcomes of the NHS compared with the health systems of other countries.\nRandox, headquartered in Belfast, is owned by Peter Fitzgerald, a Northern Irish polo-playing multimillionaire doctor. The company hired Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as a consultant from 2015, initially on \u00a349,000 a year, later doubled to \u00a3100,000 a year. Paterson\u2019s salary as an MP was about \u00a380,000. Paterson declared these payments in the register of MP\u2019s financial interests. Documents show that he then devoted considerable time and energy to lobbying on Randox\u2019s behalf.\nPaterson talked and then wrote to Priti Patel, then the secretary of state for international development, requesting a meeting so that Randox could discuss its \u201cstate of the art technologies\u201d and outlining the advantages of the firm\u2019s products.\nA meeting was later arranged between Paterson, Randox and Patel\u2019s then junior minister, Rory Stewart. \u201cThis meeting covered Randox\u2019s laboratory quality assurance systems \u2026 and DfID [Department for International Development] procurement routes and potential commercial opportunities that Randox may wish to explore\u201d, a DfID internal memo recorded. DfID told the Guardian it had never itself awarded any contracts to Randox.\nIn December 2016 Paterson also began working as a consultant for another Northern Irish company, Lynn\u2019s Country Foods, which trades under the name Finnebrogue. He declared consultancy payments from this company of \u00a312,000 a year. The company sells Finnebrogue Naked bacon, which it markets as a healthy alternative to traditional bacon. Its product is processed without the nitrite-based preservatives in most cured meat, which have been linked to cancer.\nPaterson assisted the company in a sustained lobbying campaign with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that lasted more than a year, the documents obtained by the Guardian and later published by the standards commissioner show. Paterson\u2019s early work was to raise concern about a competitor\u2019s cured meat product that claimed to be all natural. Lynn\u2019s and Paterson argued it could not justify the label under EU regulations.\nIn the course of repeated meetings with Paterson and top-level FSA staff including its chair, which sought action against the rival\u2019s product, emails say Lynn\u2019s took the opportunity to promote its own \u201cinnovative\u201d bacon product, \u201cwhich is being prepared for launch in the new year\u201d.\nLynn\u2019s marketed the new product as being free of E-number additives, but the FSA found that it did contain an additive mix that needed to be declared on the label. Over many months, Lynn\u2019s and Paterson sought to persuade the FSA that they did not need to put it on the label. Emails between officials note the \u201cconsiderable resources\u201d being used up on Paterson\u2019s paying client. They also allege that Paterson misrepresented what was said in meetings and counter the assertion that Lynn\u2019s additives had been approved by other EU countries, which turned out not to be the case.\nThe dispute appears to have ended in December 2018, when Lynn\u2019s agreed to declare on the label of Finnebrogue Naked bacon that its product contained an additive.\nPaterson maintains that he only raised these issues because they were important matters of public safety. He says the same applies to his lobbying of the FSA for Randox over antibiotic residues in milk. FSA briefing notes of meetings with Randox and Paterson record that the \u201cprimary aim for discussion\u201d was the \u201cuse of Randox technology for screening of residues\u201d. Randox had tested UK milk for antibiotic residues and found a banned drug in them. Illegal antibiotic use in livestock is a known problem in Northern Ireland.\nRandox wanted the FSA to adopt its new techniques for detecting contamination. It could not, however, show which part of the UK its samples came from, and its testing methods had not been accredited. The FSA did its own sampling across the UK and found no evidence of residues. It judged there was no safety risk.\nThe company would not long after win \u00a3500m of government work for the NHS\u2019s Covid test and trace programme. The company had already been favoured with a visit to its labs in Northern Ireland by the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, in 2019.\nThe National Audit Office confirmed the existence of a VIP lane whereby companies with government or official contacts were referred for Covid PPE contracts. Neither the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) nor Paterson answered our questions asking whether Randox had been referred to any similar VIP fast track for test and trace work.\nA Randox spokesperson told the Guardian Paterson had no involvement in the contracts being awarded. He did not answer when asked why Paterson had attended a meeting between Randox and a health minister in charge of Covid procurement in April 2020. The DHSC continues to resist an FoI request for documents relating to that meeting.\nPaterson continues to insist that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. \u201cMy integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned,\u201d he said in his resignation statement on Thursday. \u201cI maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety.\u201d",

The Black unemployment rate stands at 7.9% \u2013 more than 3% higher than the white unemployment rate of 4.2%.\nOctober\u2019s job surge was largely seen in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes hotels, entertainment and restaurants. The industry was bolstered by 164,000 jobs in October, reaching the highest number of people employed in the industry since the start of the pandemic.\nOther industries that saw increased growth in October include professional and business services, which includes marketing and accounting, manufacturing and transportation and warehousing.\nHourly and weekly wages also rose in October, a continuation of an upward trend  over the last few months, particularly as employers have had to entice workers to apply for jobs amid labor shortages.",

The web service, which is allocated a quota of stock on a \u201cwhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone\u201d basis, has also sold out of 12-month-matured Christmas puddings.\nM&S said the pre-ordering service had always been very popular \u201cbut this year, more than ever. Our slots are filling up but customers will still be able to find all the M&S food they need for Christmas in our food halls.\u201d\nThe company said many of its new Christmas products were in stores, with deliveries of fresh lines such as turkeys and desserts arriving throughout November and December.\nJust 48 of the \u201cfood to order\u201d items were still available on Friday, although that figure included turkeys where some weights were sold out. The speed with which products have gone has caught fans of M&S\u2019s upmarket fare offguard, with shoppers complaining on social media after missing out.\nTrudie Davidson, who was unable to buy a small turkey joint, wrote on its Facebook page: \u201cHow can they be sold out already??\u201d, while Jude Kane commented: \u201cSo many things sold out already \u2026 Gave up and ordered some lovely bits from Asda.\u201d\nThere is anger from customers in Northern Ireland, where the service is not available this year.

The most common items being bought or pre-ordered were food, toys and clothes.\nThe study also found that 43% of adults were still experiencing shortages when shopping, but that figure was down from 53% last time. Almost a fifth reported being unable to buy essential food, while a similar number were unable to get fuel. About two-thirds said they had encountered less choice or found that items were sold out.",

        "content": "Scientists say fall may signify cases have peaked but experts warn UK should brace for sharp rise in deaths\nCovid infections have fallen among secondary schoolchildren in England for the first time in weeks, but experts from the government\u2019s pandemic advisory body are warning that deaths and hospitalisations from the disease across the UK could soar over the next nine days.\nFigures released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics show that infection rates among children aged 11 to 16 in school years seven to 11 dropped to 7.5% in the week ending 30 October, ending rises throughout September, and down from a high of 9.1% the week before.\nWhile the infection rate is still far higher than in any other age group in the UK, scientists said the downturn may signify that cases have peaked in England, at least for the time being. While the data includes the October half-term week when children mixed less, the ONS said the tests performed in the week ending 30 October would have identified those infected before the break.\nThe ONS figures raised hopes that the wave of disease that swept through schools at the start of the autumn term may finally be on the decline.\n\u201cFor the first time in several weeks, we are seeing a decrease in infections among secondary school-aged children in England, although rates do remain high,\u201d said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the ONS Covid-19 infection survey.\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor infection rates in this age group to see any impact of half-term in next week\u2019s data.\u201d\nThe data comes amid new projections from a subcommittee of experts of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that deaths from Covid across the four home nations could rise sharply from now until Sunday week, 14 November.\nEstimates drawn up by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (SPI-M-O) show that the daily death toll could rise from the 155 recorded on 27 October \u2013 the day it met \u2013 to potentially as many as 350 by 14 November. The biggest increases could come in England and Wales, with a much smaller rise in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe latest figures from the ONS has revealed that in the week ending 22 October, 752 deaths occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, a slight decrease of 15% from the previous week, in which 882 deaths were recorded.\nIn the month of October there has generally been a decrease in Covid-19 deaths across the UK. From 1 October to 22 October, 2,574 deaths occurred where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. That was down by a fifth on the same period in September, where there were 3,227 deaths.\nGovernment data on coronavirus deaths, based on whether a death occurred within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, reveal that in the week to 3 November, a total of 877 deaths were recorded, a slight decrease of 14% on the 1,018 deaths seen in the previous week.\nThe ONS report paints an uncertain picture for the UK with an estimated 1,103,300 people infected in England in the week ending 30 October, or one in 50 people, a similar figure to the week before. According to the study, infections in England rose more slowly in the latest two weeks, continued to increase in Northern Ireland, with the trend uncertain in Wales and Scotland.\nThe ONS report states: \u201cIt is too early to determine the impact of the half-term holiday on the numbers of infections among school-aged children. This is because the tests that were carried out during the week ending 30 October will have identified positive cases from those who became infected before the half-term period.\u201d\nPaul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the report provided \u201csome reassurance\u201d that Covid infections in England may have peaked and supports what has been seen in the daily case reports, which have been falling for a couple of weeks.",

In an age of digital takeover, they highlight the benefits of physical stores, where regular customers can feel part of the family.\nSharry Cramond, the marketing director of M&S food, says the retailer began using local social media at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when there was a demand for store-by-store updates on what was in stock and whether there were queues. Now all stores have their own Facebook page and 200 have TikTok accounts; and the company draws on the Instagram posts of a host of insiders to fuel online fashion content.\nM&S gathers up to 3m views on store social media pages every week, with its stores in Yate, Bexhill and Gloucester all garnering more than 500,000 views a month. The Romford store\u2019s Halloween Thriller dance pulled in more than 300,000 views on TikTok alone.\nThe M&S TikTok clips began as just a way to make videos for Facebook, which is seen as a key way to communicate with M&S customers but have now taken off in their own right.\n\u201cWhen we set this up to tell people about pasta and toilet roll we had no idea we would be standing here today with 600 Facebook accounts,\u201d she said at the launch of M&S\u2019s Christmas ad this week.\n\u201cWe are creating social media stars. People are getting famous in their own communities.\u201d\nShe said the accounts helped to build word of mouth in local communities, which was incredibly important for a brand. \u201cPeople believe people like themselves,\u201d she said.\nThe trend builds on the use of staff to represent a brand in television ads, a technique tried and tested by the companies such as Asda and B&Q.\nField, who has a stand-in cardboard cut out, such was the disappointment when shopper fans couldn\u2019t take a selfie with him on days off, says the West Midlands store has made about 60 clips over the past year and he is in most of them after volunteering, with a colleague, to get involved.\nField, whose main role is in staff training, says M&S\u2019s social media team send out a weekly package of products and services they would like promoted but store teams have \u201ca lot of freedom to presents things how we want to\u201d.\nHe was a bit taken by surprise by the popularity of some posts but says: \u201cI think customers love it. It shows someone they can relate to talking about products and services and it is not too serious. It can be a bit of fun, a laugh and a joke compared to traditional advertising.\u201d\nJohn Lewis started working with staff on social media in 2017 and there are now 366 with Instagram accounts linked to their work. The company provides social media coaching and training on how to create engaging content but the staff have full editorial control over what they post.\nThe retailer has a talent division, aimed at turning its most successful social media operators into influencers.\nVictoria Thewlis, a personal stylist who has more than 30,000 followers on Instagram, with some of her posts being viewed millions of times, says she began with picturing potential outfits laid flat. Now she posts videos and lots of pictures of herself going about daily life with tips and responding to questions she\u2019s had from customers. \u201cIt\u2019s not all sell, sell, sell, it\u2019s about inspiration and ideas,\u201d she says. Customers are as interested in what she\u2019s wearing to work as what she\u2019s wearing on a night out. \u201cYou have to tap into your inner narcissist,\u201d she says.\nThe power of Instagram became particularly obvious during the pandemic when Thewlis was able to continue working online while stores were forced to close \u2013 getting virtual personal stylist appointments via her Instagram account. Now 80% of appointments in store are also from people who have seen her social media account.\n\u201cWe are experts and [now] we are able to bring our help to a wider audience,\u201d she says.",

        "content": "Figures will prompt concern in No 10 and Home Office after pledges to curb numbers entering country\nThe number of people crossing the Channel by small boats in a single day reached a record number for this century on Wednesday, eclipsing the daily arrival figures during the summer.\nDespite the low November temperatures, at least 853 people came to the UK, the Home Office confirmed. The figure surpasses the previous daily record of 828 set in August.\nThe figures will prompt renewed concern in Downing Street and the Home Office after high-profile pledges that the numbers of people entering the UK by boat would be curbed. It was widely assumed that the numbers of arrivals by boat would drop in the winter.\nThey come after a week of fatalities for those trying to leave France for the UK. A train struck and killed a person from Eritrea near Calais and at least two bodies were recovered from the sea and a beach.\nThe Home Office confirmed on Friday that the UK authorities rescued or intercept 853 people in 25 incidents. French authorities said two people died this week while attempting the journey and several more were feared lost at sea last week.\nBridget Chapman, a case worker at Kent Refugee Action Network, which helps young refugee and asylum seekers, said recent rivals may have made the crossing on Wednesday because of clear weather and because of their increasingly desperate plight in France.\n\u201cIt was a cold but calm day to cross the Channel, followed by bad weather. We also hear that the conditions in Calais for people living rough are getting worse \u2013 French police beat young men and break up roadside encampments,\u201d she said.\nThe figure has been surpassed on previous occasions when local people in Kent welcomed refugees. During a single day in mid August 1914, around 16,000 Belgian refugees landed in Folkestone Harbour, doubling the number of people in the coastal town.\nSpeaking of the Calais train incident, Franck Dhersin, a regional vice-president for transportation in the Hauts-de-France region, told the French broadcaster BFM-TV they were among a group of migrants walking along the tracks in heavy rain and after dark, making it hard for the train driver to see them.\nAs well as the fataility, one person is in a critical condition after the incident on Thursday evening and two others sustained minor injuries, according to Dhersin.\nDhersin, also a village mayor near the coastal town of Dunkirk, said dozens of migrants were arriving daily in the area. He appealed for help, saying: \u201cWe feel abandoned by the government.\u201d\nMore than 21,000 people have made the crossing to the UK so far this year, more than double the total for the whole of 2020. Campaigners and aid charities have repeatedly called on ministers to overhaul the asylum system in light of the soaring numbers.\nThe Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said one person was found dead on the beach at Wissant, near Calais, on Thursday morning after the discovery of a boat filled with water.\nTwo other people found with them were suffering from hypothermia, and were treated by emergency services and taken to hospital.\nAnother person died attempting the crossing on Wednesday, said French authorities, who had carried out a rescue mission in the strait of Pas-de-Calais. It is believed they were unconscious when they were pulled from the water and pronounced dead as rescuers returned to shore. Another person has been reported as missing.\nTwo men \u2013 both Somali nationals \u2013 were rescued off the Essex coast near Harwich on 25 October and searches for any possible remaining survivors have been called off.\nRefugee charities have pointed out that people seeking asylum have no choice but to take extreme and dangerous journeys to find safety in the UK.\nIn 2019, the home secretary, Priti Patel, promised to make migrant crossings an \u201cinfrequent phenomenon\u201d by spring 2020 and pledged in August last year to \u201cmake this route unviable\u201d. During this time, the government has agreed to pay France tens of millions of pounds to increase security on its northern coast.",

        "content": "Judge rules that the Bugaled Breizh sank after its fishing gear snagged on the seabed off Cornwall\nA British judge has concluded that a submarine did not cause the sinking of a fishing boat that capsized off the Cornish coast with the loss of five men almost 18 years ago.\nThe judge Nigel Lickley QC, who has overseen an inquest on the tragedy, ruled that the French trawler Bugaled Breizh sank after its fishing gear snagged on the seabed, causing it to heel \u2013 tip to one side \u2013 and take in water.\nRelatives of the men lost in the tragedy have long believed the boat sank after a submarine became tangled in its fishing gear, and they saw the inquest in London as a last chance to get to what they believe is the truth.\nDuring the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice, the UK\u2019s most senior submarine commanders testified that there were three allied submarines at sea in the area at the time, gathering for a military exercise. However, they said the nearest \u2013 the Dutch submarine Dolfijn \u2013 was about 11 nautical miles from the Bugaled Breizh when the fishing boat sank.\nThey also said a fourth submarine that relatives have suspected may have been involved, HMS Turbulent, was berthed in Plymouth on the day, and they told the court they were sure that no non-allied subs were in the area.\nLickley said the reason for the sinking had been the subject of \u201cdebate and speculation\u201d. He suggested this had been prompted by the sighting of a submarine during the rescue operation but said he was sure this was Dolfijn, which arrived well after the sinking to help search for survivors.\nThe judge said he was satisfied that the Royal Navy had told the truth about the position of allied submarines that day, describing the evidence of the commanders as \u201ccredible\u201d. \u201cNone [of the allied submarines] was close to the Bugaled Breizh at the time she sank, they were many miles away,\u201d he said.\nThe judge added that he believed the conclusions of naval officers that they were sure no non-allied submarines were in the area. The judge said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d Turbulent was in dock at the time.\nLickley said that if a submarine had become entangled with the fishing gear, it would have caused more damage to the equipment. He also ruled that the \u201cgeometry\u201d of how the gear was found was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with it being dragged by a submarine. \u201cThe evidence does not support submarine involvement,\u201d he said.\nThe judge said he believed that the sinking, on 15 January 2004, was a fishing accident. He concluded that the boat\u2019s fishing gear became buried in the seabed, causing the vessel to heel, take on water and sink within minutes.\nFive Frenchmen died: Yves Marie Gloaguen, 45, Pascal Lucien Le Floch, 49, Patrick Gloaguen, 35, Georges Lemetayer, 60, and Eric Guillamet, 42. Because the first two were flown by rescuers to Cornwall, an inquest has been heard in the UK. It was delayed until now while the French authorities investigated.\nIn his 114-page judgment, Lickley said details of the \u201charsh and demanding\u201d conditions fishers worked in had emerged during the inquest. He said there was no suggestion the boat was unsafe or unlicensed, and it was entitled to fish in the spot where it sank. The crew was experienced and competent, he said.\nDespite the judge\u2019s conclusions, there were snippets that will be seized on by conspiracy theorists who believe there has been a cover-up. During his summary on Friday, the judge reminded the court that one very experienced lifeboat coxswain had said this was the first time he had ever seen a submarine at a rescue. The coxswain described submariners as \u201csecretive\u201d.\nLickley also summed up the evidence that a naval officer onboard a rescue helicopter allegedly told crew members not to mention that they had seen a submarine.",

While I understand the sentiment, there is a danger that this becomes the only route for trying to convince the country that radical action is needed. The case needs making repeatedly, even though it\u2019s tedious for those of us who have long been convinced. What we miss is that many people have barely got their heads around the need for radical action and others completely reject the idea. Despite earlier optimism that Covid would engender a major change in outlook, the dominant narrative now is business as usual \u2013 with a modest green makeover.\nDirect action may feel right to activists but, to those affected, the disruption to their daily lives creates hostility to even thinking about the need for change. It\u2019s no good telling them that blocking the road is a minor inconvenience compared with climate breakdown \u2013 they will just regard activists as zealots.\nThe narrative around home insulation is barely articulated \u2013 we have among the worst-insulated houses in Europe. To date, the UK\u2019s efforts at tackling this have been feeble, with tiny programmes, often abandoned. Yet a properly funded 10-year programme, following the Dutch Energiesprong model, would deliver hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs and help eliminate fuel poverty.\nThe argument needs making every day by civil society groups and sympathetic political parties. Instead, we have a series of standoffs on the roads, with activists vowing more disruption and the government promising more draconian measures to restrict protest. The issue itself barely gets any coverage.John RigbyMuch Wenlock, Shropshire\n John Harris makes some cogent points about the shortcomings of our two main political parties and the need for more Green votes. However, for that to happen, journalists and politicians need to cut through the rhetoric and waffle, and make clear three things.\nFirst, why capitalism can only ever be the cause of, rather than the solution to, our crisis. This case needs to be convincingly made in terms that the majority of voters can understand, starting with a clear definition of what is actually meant by capitalism. Second, what system should replace capitalism. And third, what a truly sustainable lifestyle might look like. This picture, premised on a radical redistribution of wealth both nationally and globally, would probably be one of startling simplicity and frugality. However, it would have the unique advantage of promising voters the scarcest but most desirable commodity of all: hope.Tim BurtonWhissonsett, Norfolk\n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

        "content": "James Ratcliffe\u2019s car company may have spent well over \u00a3650m on offroader project\nSir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s car company has made losses of more than \u00a3250m over three years as the billionaire businessman ploughs money into his effort to make a Land Rover rival that could also lead to new vans and construction vehicles.\nIneos Automotive, a subsidiary of Ratcliffe\u2019s chemicals conglomerate, reported a loss of \u20ac106m (\u00a391m) in 2020 in its latest accounts, adding to \u20ac188m lost in the previous two years. Ratcliffe\u2019s other companies have also lent \u20ac471m (\u00a3403m) to the automotive subsidiary, meaning his total commitment so far may be well in excess of \u00a3650m.\nThe Ineos Grenadier offroader will initially use an internal combustion engine, but Ineos is also looking at hydrogen fuel cell technology that it could eventually also use to power vans and construction equipment, according to separate details revealed in a government research funding notice that suggests that Ratcliffe has broader automotive ambitions.\nRatcliffe is one of Britain\u2019s richest people, with a net worth of more than \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times. However, he last year moved to Monaco for tax purposes despite being a vocal proponent of Brexit on the grounds that the UK would \u201cthrive as an independent nation\u201d outside the EU.\nThe initial plan was for the car, named after his favourite London pub, to be built in Bridgend, south Wales, but the town\u2019s hopes for an automotive revival were dashed when Ineos instead pounced on a Smart car plant in Hambach, in eastern France, after it was put up for sale by Mercedes-Benz.\nThe car\u2019s launch has already been delayed by months because of difficulties sourcing parts amid pandemic supply chain issues. Initially Ineos had planned to release it in early 2022, but that has slipped to at least September 2022.\nIneos received \u00a3124,000 from the UK government in 2019-20 for a feasibility study of hydrogen fuel cells, which produce no exhaust emissions other than water, and last year it signed a deal with Hyundai to use the South Korean carmaker\u2019s technology.\nRatcliffe is not the only wealthy British knight to plough hundreds of millions of pounds trying to break into the automotive market. Sir James Dyson, the vacuum cleaner innovator, last year revealed that he had spent more than \u00a3500m on his effort to make an electric SUV.\nDyson, also a keen proponent of Brexit who then moved his company out of the UK, scrapped his car once he realised how difficult it would be take on established carmakers who can cross-subsidise the development of electric models using profits from petrol car sales.\nAn Ineos Automotive spokesperson said:\u201cAs is standard within the automotive industry when developing a new vehicle, programme costs and spending vary throughout the process with a lot of the spend coming just ahead of going into production.\n\u201cWe are delighted about the progress we have made and have had a fantastic response from our customers with reservations for the Grenadier, exceeding our most positive expectations. Importantly we are still on track to be in production from July 22 and delivering Grenadiers to customers shortly afterwards.\u201d",

He began defrauding the group of GP surgeries in Hampshire as soon as he was put in charge of its accounts, leaving its finances in disarray and other directors needing therapy.\nUnusually, gambling companies have agreed to pay back \u00a3904,000 of the money after Chhapia, 45, who himself earned nearly \u00a3200,000 a year, wrote letters to them.\nChhapia, a father of one, co-founded Portsmouth Primary Care Alliance (PPCA), a group of 16 GP surgeries in the Hampshire city. In August last year, the man who was in charge of its finances was signed off sick and Chhapia volunteered to manage its accounts.\nWhen a colleague spotted that money was vanishing, Chhapia claimed he was the victim of cybercrime and continued to embezzle funds, the prosecutor, Matthew Lawson, said. Police investigated and Chhapia admitted: \u201cI fucked up.\u201d\nHis fraud was described at Portsmouth crown court as \u201crelatively unsophisticated\u201d as he simply transferred money into accounts in his own name. Of the money he embezzled, he gave back \u00a3238,000 and gambling companies will pay back \u00a3904,000.\nLawson said Chhapia\u2019s online gambling addiction escalated so severely he remortgaged his home, sold his car and failed to pay back friends who loaned him more than \u00a3300,000.\nMark Swindells, a PPCA director, told the court: \u201cThe financial impact was profound, the people of Portsmouth lost a sizeable chunk of NHS money. Although we are financially solvent, it\u2019s reduced the overall budget and caused cashflow issues.\u201d\nStan Reiz QC, defending, said Chhapia felt he was \u201cone win away\u201d from financial security. \u201cHe entered into a desperation phase and thought the next bet would be the panacea of all his bets,\u201d the barrister said. \u201cHe felt the need to keep taking the money even after they raised the alarm to try and win.\u201d\nReiz said the fraud took place over \u201csix weeks of madness\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is an unusual and tragic case. The references from his esteemed colleagues describe a hardworking and honest man who has acted wholly out of character. For many years he gambled for fun but then progressed to that next stage and entered the losing stage when a gambler begins to chase losses.\u201d\nJailing him, Judge Keith Cutler, said: \u201cYou abused the trust placed on you and took \u00a31.13m from the PPCA, money which in my judgment should have been for GP surgeries to develop their services.\n\u201cThis is a very serious abrogation of your responsibilities as a doctor. Your duty should have been to provide the very best care to your patients and that should have been the pinnacle, but you were dishonest.\u201d\nChhapia, of Portsmouth, resigned from his role in October last year. He admitted fraud by abuse of position.",

Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, broke down in tears.\nThe video shows Travis McMichael opening fire three times on Arbery, who was unarmed, with a Remington 12-gauge pump-action shotgun.\nThe shooting happened in February 2020, on a quiet street in rural south Georgia, as McMichael, his father and co-defendant Gregory McMichael and a neighbor, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, attempted to block Arbery, who was on foot, by pursuing him in two vehicles.\nArbery, who was known to go jogging in the area, was described by prosecutors as \u201can avid runner\u201d. The jury was told that evidence would show that the McMichaels had wrongly assumed the 25-year-old was attempting a burglary at a house under construction in the Satilla Shores neighbourhood.\n\u201cThis was an attack on Mr Arbery for five minutes, and the only thing Mr Arbery did was try to run away,\u201d lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told the jury of 11 white members and one Black member.\nThe three defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment, in a case thrust into the global spotlight.\nDuring detailed opening arguments, Dunikoski told the jury Gregory McMichael informed police after the shooting that he called out to Arbery during the pursuit, \u201cStop or I\u2019ll blow your fucking head off\u201d, and also told police Arbery had been \u201ctrapped like a rat\u201d during their five-minute chase.\n\u201cWe are here because of assumptions and driveway decisions,\u201d Dunikoski said as the three defendants looked on. \u201cA very wise person once said, do not assume the worst of another person\u2019s intentions until you actually know what\u2019s going on with them.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cAnd in this case, all three of these defendants did everything that they did based on assumptions. And they made decisions in their driveways based on assumptions that took a young man\u2019s life and that\u2019s why we are here.\u201d\nDunikoski played videos of Arbery inside the under-construction house dating back to late August 2019, in an attempt to show he had routinely run through the neighborhood and stopped off at the house without stealing anything. The McMichaels\u2019 fatal pursuit of Arbery occurred on 23 February 2020.\nDunikoski also played a 911 emergency call Gregory McMichael made to police before Arbery was shot, in which he said: \u201cI\u2019m here in Satilla Shores. A Black male is running down the street.\u201d\n The prosecutor said evidence would show the McMichaels initially pursued Arbery in their white truck before driving ahead in an attempt to close him off, while Bryan attacked Arbery by ramming him in a separate truck four times.\nProsecutors said evidence would show a palm print of Arbery\u2019s on Bryan\u2019s vehicle as well as white T-shirt fibres belonging to Arbery on the truck.\n Arbery was cornered by the three men, and Travis McMichael pointed his shotgun before opening fire as Arbery continued to run.\n Shortly after Dunikoski concluded her statements, Bryan\u2019s attorney, Kevin Gough, argued that the presiding judge, Timothy Walmsley, should declare a mistrial because details of the initial investigation into the shooting were disclosed during the opening. Walmsley declined.\nDuring defense opening arguments, lawyers for Travis McMichael argued he acted in self-defense when he opened fire, and cited a citizen\u2019s arrest law that was revoked in response to the incident.\nRobert Rubin, the younger McMichael\u2019s lawyer, argued his client had been attempting to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the situation when he raised his shotgun and that he opened fire when he feared for his and his father\u2019s life.\n\u201cIt is a citizen\u2019s job to help the police and the law authorizes that,\u201d Rubin told the court. \u201cWhen seconds count, the police are often minutes away. The police are not going to catch this guy at the speed he\u2019s running.\u201d\nGeorgia\u2019s response to Arbery\u2019s killing has become part of a broader effort to address racial injustice in the US legal system after a string of fatal encounters between police and Black people such as George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.\nJudge Walmsley swore in the disproportionately white jury on Friday. Although Glynn county, where the court is located, has an African American populationof 26%, the jury pool was whittled down until only one Black person was seated. Defense attorneys struck 11 Black potential jurors, an outcome the judge criticized. Abery\u2019s mother called the imbalance in the jury \u201cdevastating\u201d.\n  The trial continues.",

Relentlessly gritty and superbly performed, it is both ambitious kitchen sink drama and state of the nation play in one, refracting intertwined themes of social deprivation, criminality and police injustice through a single family in New South Wales, Australia.\nAlana Valentine\u2019s script focuses mainly on the Macreadie clan\u2019s women who are rough, tough and argumentative, with matriarch June (Janine Ulfane) at the helm. She is eaten up by the fear that the petty criminality that has accompanied her early family life will be carried through to the next generation as \u201cbad blood\u201d. This fear is inflamed when her son Olli (Adam Fitzgerald) is imprisoned: \u201cI ran away from it,\u201d she says, \u201cand found out it\u2019s hiding in my hair, my clothes \u2026\u201d\nThe drama circles around one building in Pyrmont, in Sydney, a 1960s sugar factory which has been turned into trendy apartments by 2007. The plot hinges on gentrification but this feels like a flimsy framing device more than a theme. Nonetheless, the sprawl of time is covered deftly by director Tom Brennan and set designer Justin Nardella who work with a small stage, using a few bits of furniture and a back screen to nimble effect.\nUnvarnished and enraged characters are roughly drawn, from the hard-as-nails June to her resentful daughter Margo (Fiona Skinner) and confused granddaughter Narelle (Jessica Zerlina Leafe). If the characters do not always have enough texture to them, a phenomenal cast evoke their pain and pathos, sometimes doubling up in roles and bringing some very difficult moments alive \u2013 from Leafe\u2019s performance as an eight-year-old to Margo\u2019s death from cancer, searingly performed by Skinner.\nThere are some wonderful moments in this hard, passionate and unsentimental play although it falls into making occasional speeches on its themes. The talk of bad blood is over-egged but becomes a metaphor for attempting to escape the greater restrictions placed on dispossessed lives. The women here achieve that through activism. While the play never romanticises this side of their lives, it does bring some catharsis through their struggles.\n At the Finborough theatre, London, until 20 November.",

While there are a mixture of views among Asean countries about Aukus, Indonesia and Malaysia have been the most public in raising concerns.\nThe Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, \u201crepeatedly and forcefully\u201d raised concerns about the submarine deal when the prime minister, Scott Morrison, met virtually with Asean leaders last week, according to the ABC, which was first to reveal Payne\u2019s regional travel plans.\nMorrison then met with Indonesia\u2019s leader on the sidelines of the G20 in Rome last weekend. Despite those concerns, Asean agreed last week to elevate the status of its relationship with Australia.\nBen Bland, the director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute, said part of the foreign minister\u2019s mission would be to reassure counterparts over Aukus.\n\u201cThe message will likely be that Australia needs to act in its national interest to protect itself but these submarine plans aren\u2019t targeted against Southeast Asian partners \u2013 in fact Australia thinks they will help to stabilise the balance of power in the region,\u201d he said.\nBland said it would be just as important for Payne to listen to her counterparts\u2019 views.\nWhile submarines were attracting significant attention in Australia, Bland said, \u201cI think it\u2019d be a mistake to let Aukus obscure the many facets of Australia\u2019s relationships with south-east Asia.\u201d\nBland said the trip reflected Australia\u2019s need to \u201cmake up for lost ground\u201d in in-person diplomacy in south-east Asia, given that China, Japan, the US and the UK had been more active in the region over the past year-and-a-half.\nThe situation in Myanmar \u2013 nine months after the military coup \u2013 will also be a \u201cvery difficult\u201d issue in Payne\u2019s talks. Bland said Asean had taken unprecedented action by uninviting the leader of the junta from recent summits, but he did not think that symbolised a dramatic shift in the regional bloc\u2019s approach.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve effectively kicked the can down the road with Myanmar because all the other junta ministers and junta officials have been engaging with Asean in many other fora,\u201d Bland said.\n\u201cUp to now, we\u2019ve seen Australia take a bit of a backseat in all this \u2013 formally backing the Asean position and saying we put Asean first but in the end, sadly, using that as cover for passivity.\u201d\nAmid concerns about China\u2019s military modernisation and grey-zone activities in the South China Sea, Australia has been signalling for some time that it wants to play a more active role in \u201cshaping\u201d the strategic environment.\nThe 2017 foreign policy white paper said with growing competition between the US and China for influence, Australia would \u201censure we are a leading security, economic and development partner for Southeast Asia\u201d.\nLast year the government\u2019s defence strategic update said Australia \u201cmust be an active and assertive advocate for stability, security and sovereignty\u201d in the immediate region.",

When asked about the Hawkins-Rumker region, he replied that he intended to take \u201ca proposal to my colleagues to rule it out\u201d.\nGuardian Australia approached Toole\u2019s office about whether he also planned to rule out mines at Ganguddy-Kelgoola and near the historic town of Wollombi but did not get a direct response.\n\u201cThe reports considered by the ABSR will be publicly released once a government decision is made, in line with the Guidelines for the Strategic Release Framework,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThis Hawkins-Rumker decision, which would have brought a big mine close to the town of Rylstone on the Wollemi\u2019s western edge, was \u201cconsistent with the Future of Coal Statement which sets out the NSW government\u2019s proactive and balanced approach to the future of coal mining in the state\u201d, the spokesperson said.\nBarilaro said it was important to end the \u201cmental anguish\u201d imposed on communities near mine proposals that would never proceed.\n\u201cWe know, pragmatically that for these industries, there is just no way in the world a standalone greenfield coalmine will actually start in this state in five or seven years\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might as well just end that anxiety today, and that\u2019s what I was doing.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave politics with people just thinking I was a coal baron and anti the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to kill off any standalone greenfield coalmines, and the only ones that we would consider would be the extensions to existing mines and only because that infrastructure was in place.\u201d\nThe news that Barilaro was preparing to ditch all three big areas came as a surprise to the Minerals Council.\n\u201cIn terms of the other areas [than Hawkins-Rumker] we\u2019re not aware of any changes planned for the Strategic Statement on Coal that was released last year,\u201d chief executive Stephen Galilee said. \u201cHowever, as I\u2019ve said previously, we\u2019re not aware of any companies seeking to explore in the Wollombi area.\u201d\nGeorgina Woods of the Lock the Gate alliance welcomed comments that Wollombi and Ganguddy-Kelgoola were earmarked to be removed from the \u201cthreat list\u201d.\n\u201cIt seems unlikely there will be new greenfield coal exploitation in NSW at this point, but we are very concerned about the expansion of coal exploration and mining by Peabody near Wollar and by Whitehaven Coal in one of the remaining areas on John Barilaro\u2019s Strategic Release process list, an area south of Narrabri known as Gorman North,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPutting any rural community in the path of new coal exploration at this point creates distress and inhibits investment in the energy and industry of the future.\u201d\nGreens spokeswoman Cate Faehrmann said: \u201cThe deputy premier [Toole] cited economic and social concerns as to why he intends to rule out opening up [Hawkins-Rumker] for coal. He needs to apply his same logic to all coal and gas projects in the planning pipeline including the Ganguddy-Kelgoola release area.\u201d\n\u201cOpening up new coal areas is incompatible with the Paris commitment of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,\u201d she said.\n Barilaro\u2019s intervention comes as the NSW Labor party steps into campaigning mode, announcing on Saturday it will introduce a private member\u2019s bill seeking to legislate a net zero emissions target by 2050.\nAnnounced in Bega, one of five NSW seats due to hold byelections in the next few months, by opposition leader Chris Minns, the plan will seek to put pressure on a Coalition government which has trumpeted its own ambitious emissions targets.\nThe Coalition government in NSW has already committed to halving its emissions by 2030, a target underpinned by clean energy legislation passed with multi-party support last year which will see the state build 12 gigawatts of clean energy and 2GW of energy storage in the next decade.",

        "content": "The racism scandal that has engulfed Yorkshire County Cricket Club sparked recriminations and resignations on Friday as the chairman resigned and accused the English game\u2019s governing body of failing to act.\nRoger Hutton, the chairman of Yorkshire, stepped down along with two other board members in the wake of the row over Azeem Rafiq, the former Yorkshire cricketer who in 2020 went public with allegations of racial harassment and prompted a 12-month investigation that resulted no current employees at the club facing action.\nOn Friday evening it emerged the Equality and Human Rights Commission had made contact with Yorkshire requesting access to the full independent report into Rafiq\u2019s claims and was considering whether or not to pursue action against the club.\nTom Harrison, chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, who had called on the board to quit, described the events of the past week as \u201cvindication\u201d for Rafiq\nBut Harrison\u2019s own role came under fire. To the surprise of many Harrison admitted he had not read the 100-plus page report that was completed in September, upheld seven of Rafiq\u2019s 43 claims, and was belatedly delivered, unredacted, to the ECB last week. The chief executive insisted, however, it must first go through the governing body\u2019s regulatory process and stressed this was an example of \u201cgood governance at work\u201d.\nSpeaking after the ECB took the decision to suspend Yorkshire from hosting England fixtures \u2013 something which could cost the clubs millions in lost revenues if it rolls into next summer and the Test match versus New Zealand moves to another venue \u2013 Harrison insisted a message had been delivered that racism has no place in the sport.\nHe said: \u201cThere are going to be a lot of people from different backgrounds and cultures that have looked at what\u2019s been happening over the last few days and feel very uncomfortable about whether they want their children or their partner or themselves to be involved in cricket. So we have had to step in the most direct way and take unprecedented action in defending the values of the sport.\u201d\nAsked for his message to Rafiq, Harrison replied: \u201cI think now it feels like this is some vindication for Azeem. I hope that Azeem can see, frustrating as it must have been given the length of time this has taken, how serious the ECB is about matters relating to race in cricket. I think that his patience is probably very short and I would understand that. But I hope in time that Azeem can become a person for whom cricket is part of his life again, without feeling that the game has let him down in a big way.\u201d\nAnnouncing his resignation at 8am, before a board meeting at Yorkshire on Friday morning, Hutton piled into the ECB. \u201cI want to be clear that when I was made aware of Azeem Rafiq\u2019s allegations, I immediately reached out to the ECB to ask for their help and intervention to support a robust inquiry. I was saddened when they declined to help as I felt it was a matter of great importance for the game as a whole.\n\u201cIt is a matter of record that I have continually expressed my frustration at the ECB\u2019s reluctance to act. There has been a constant unwillingness from the executive members of the board and senior management at the club to apologise, and to accept that there was racism, and to look forward. For much of my time at the club, I experienced a culture that refuses to accept change or challenge.\u201d\nHarrison, in response, stressed that taking a place on the panel that oversaw this process would have compromised the ECB\u2019s role as the sport\u2019s regulator.\nIt was reported on Thursday night that Yorkshire will launch an investigation after another former player came forward to allege being subjected to racist abuse while at the club.\nThe unnamed player, who is of Asian heritage, was quoted in the Daily Mail to have been victim of incidents of racist abuse that was \u201cboth blatant and sly\u201d in the early 2000s.\nThe club has experienced a reckoning this week and now begins life under the stewardship of Lord Patel of Bradford. Previously deputy chair of the ECB and still a close ally of the former Yorkshire and ECB chair, Colin Graves, the 61-year-old grew up in Bradford and has spoken previously about his own experiences of racism.\n\u201cThe club needs to learn from its past errors, regain trust and rebuild relationships with our communities,\u201d said Patel, upon being named the new chair. \u201cThere is much work to do, including reading the panel\u2019s report, so we can begin the process of learning from our past mistakes.\u201d\nHowever the fallout is far from over. Rafiq is set to give evidence to parliament\u2019s digital, culture, media and sport select committee on 16 November and, covered by parliamentary privilege, can speak freely about his experiences at the club between 2008 and 2018. While both Gary Ballance and Michael Vaughan have both addressed allegations publicly this week, other names could follow.\nThe make-up of the club\u2019s leadership is not completely overhauled either. When Hutton stood down as Yorkshire chair, offering an unreserved apology to Rafiq in the process, he bemoaned \u201ca culture that refuses to accept change or challenge\u201d and \u201ca constant unwillingness from the executive members of the board and senior management at the club to apologise.\u201d This appeared to point to Mark Arthur, the chief executive, and Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, to whom Rafiq reported racism upon being released by the club in 2018 just weeks after he and his wife had lost their first child. Both Arthur and Moxon, along with Hanif Malik, the club\u2019s diversity chair, were deemed by the club\u2019s report to have failed in not escalating his claims formally at the time.\nBut while Malik resigned from the Yorkshire board on Friday, along with another member in Stephen Willis, both Arthur and Moxon remain in their positions. Neither has commented on the scandal since Rafiq first aired his complaints publicly in a series of interviews in August 2020 but, along with Hutton, are both expected to give evidence at the upcoming DCMS hearing.\nYorkshire have also lost a raft of sponsors over the past week and are still face the prospect of further sanctions pending the outcome of the ECB\u2019s investigation. The governing body, which stripped Durham of its Test status in 2016 after a financial bail-out, must balance any punishments against burying a first-class county that has been in operation for 158 years and a cricket board that has more than 700 affiliated recreational clubs.\nThe ECB will also have to make a final decision on Ballance, the Yorkshire batsman who was suspended from England duty on Thursday after confirming he had used racial slurs towards Rafiq when teammates, while the BBC is in talks with Vaughan, the former England captain, and his representatives over his continuation as a pundit.\nIt was announced yesterday that Vaughan will not appear on Monday\u2019s Radio 5 live show Tuffers & Vaughan amid an allegation that the 47-year-old told four players of Asian heritage \u2013 Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naved \u2013 that there were \u201ctoo many of you lot, we need to do something about it\u201d in 2009.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Vaughan said: \u201cI completely and categorically deny that I ever said those words.\u201d On Friday Naved, the former Pakistan international, told ESPNCricinfo he too had heard this at the time. Like the scandal as a whole, this element is likely to rumble on for some time yet.",

        "content": "Owen Farrell\u2019s positive test means England\u2019s head coach has big worries ahead of Tonga\u2019s arrival to Twickenham on Saturday\nNot since that distant autumn week in 2000 when England\u2019s players went on strike has there been a more fraught home buildup to a November international at Twickenham. Eddie Jones has been looking forward to his side\u2019s opening game with Tonga for months but his best-laid plans are in danger of disintegrating after his captain Owen Farrell\u2019s positive test for Covid-19.\nHaving returned a positive PCR test result, Farrell had to miss England\u2019s final team run after being told to isolate at their Bagshot hotel. While all other players and staff have so far tested negative, an unnamed backroom staff member also returned a positive lateral flow test on Thursday and the RFU will now have its fingers tightly crossed that the virus does not spread further across a squad which, it is understood, contains some unvaccinated players.\nThe governing body opted for another round of testing for all players and staff on Friday. The results were not due until Saturday morning, just hours before England are due to host Tonga and any more positive tests would mean more chaos for England. George Furbank is most likely to start at fly-half if Farrell, who also tested positive for Covid last winter, misses out, though Marcus Smith could also be promoted from the bench. Courtney Lawes would be the front-runner for the captaincy.\nFrom a rugby perspective, eyebrows are already being raised about the wisdom or otherwise of England\u2019s contingency planning. If losing their captain and chief playmaker on the eve of his 100th international appearance is a disruptive enough scenario, even the idea of a stop-gap option such as Northampton\u2019s Furbank starting at 10 with Harlequins\u2019 Smith still only on the bench will baffle many red rose fans. If Smith is not the best option to step up with Farrell sidelined, is he fit enough to feature at all?\nJones, though, has long insisted the 25-year-old Furbank, mostly a full-back for his club, has the ability to play at 10 and the Saints\u2019 director of rugby, Chris Boyd, feels similarly. A utility player such as Furbank might be particularly useful in a future World Cup squad context and, in that regard, this could be a decent opportunity to see what he can do.\nBut would that be the optimal use of this particular fixture, with Australia arriving at Twickenham next Saturday before the world champions, South Africa, the following weekend? And if Smith was always unlikely to train for much of the week, why was Leicester\u2019s George Ford, currently in sparkling form but omitted from the original squad, not called up as cover? It is an odd one, unless Jones feels Tonga can be beaten even if he were to stick Joe Marler at fly-half.\nThe captaincy conundrum is equally intriguing. By opting to ditch his old leadership team and install three vice-captains \u2013 Lawes, Tom Curry and Ellis Genge \u2013 with no international experience as a skipper, Jones is about to find out sooner than anticipated whether or not the reshuffle was an inspired hunch.\nOf the three candidates, Lawes ranks as comfortably the most seasoned. Yet before 2017, when he captained Saints on a few occasions while Dylan Hartley was injured, Lawes\u2019 only previous captaincy experience was as a 15-year-old at home in the east midlands. \u201cI am too laidback to be a captain,\u201d he told the Observer last year. \u201cYou have to be on it all the time. Off the pitch I am pretty chilled and do not like to stress too much. I am happy to lead by example.\u201d\nIn the wider scheme of things, though, it does England no harm to react to circumstances on the hoof occasionally, as every top side must have the mindset to do. If Tonga, beaten 60-14 by Scotland last week, are unlikely to take Twickenham by storm \u2013 they are ranked 15th in the world below Georgia, Samoa and Italy \u2013 they are reliably physical and will test England\u2019s ability to problem solve before the visits of Australia and South Africa to Twickenham over the next two weekends.\nThe key will be the pace at which England are able to play and the efficacy of the direct midfield running lines that can create space further out for Adam Radwan and Jonny May a phase or two later. When England last played Tonga at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, their four tries came from Manu Tuilagi, who scored twice, Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie. Close-quarter power will once again be high on Jones\u2019s wishlist, with Tuilagi playing his first Test since March 2020.\nIllness and untimely injuries to Max Malins, Harry Randall and Raffi Quirke aside, this England team also looks to have been picked with more than one eye on the Wallabies next week. With big opponents such as Rory Arnold, Izack Rodda and Will Skelton all looming, England clearly see value in beefing up their lineout with the lofty trio of Lawes, Maro Itoje and Jonny Hill and Tonga offer a useful dry run in that respect.\nThen again, there are a host of potential downsides. No Farrell to kick the goals, a rookie captain, a phalanx of new assistant coaches and a potential array of Covid-19 complications: Tonga may feel there is an unexpected chance to improve on their 42-point average losing margin in their past 10 games against top-tier opposition. Three of their players ply their trade in the Premiership \u2013 Hosea Saumaki at Leicester, Steve Mafi at London Irish and Sione Vailanu at Worcester \u2013 while Telusa Veainu was a crowd favourite at Welford Road.\nThey will be doing well, even so, if they can prevent their hosts running up a score in the second half on a ground where England have lost only one of their past 18 Tests. It has been a while, too, since a full Twickenham was rocking with passion, fervour and excitement, full of people genuinely exhilarated by what they are watching.\nSome of last autumn\u2019s fare behind closed doors was virtually unwatchable and Amazon Prime, among others, will be praying for something more compelling this time. At this precise moment, though, most Rugby Football Union employees would simply settle for 23 players testing negative, a routine win and a quieter life.",

His housemate tested positive on Friday.\nAuthorities announced on Saturday that a 21-year-old woman who arrived from Cairns on the 29 October, and spent time with the man, had also tested positive. She only became symptomatic on Saturday.\nThey stayed at Darwin\u2019s Mantra Hotel last weekend, and visited the Monsoons pub and nightclub.\nSince 12.01am Friday, Katherine residents have only been allowed to leave their homes for five reasons: to access goods and services, receive medical treatment, provide care and support, perform essential work and exercise.\nGreater Darwin is also locked out of Katherine in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.\nThe NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, said that 1,200 Covid-19 tests had been administered on Friday.\nAsked whether the snap lockdown would end on Sunday as planned, Gunner said he was \u201cfeeling positive about the fact we have three cases who are linked\u201d.\nBut, Gunner cautioned, it is still likely there is another undetected case out there from whom the man and woman caught the virus.\n\u201cWhat probably concerns us most at the moment is that we don\u2019t have certainty about how the three people acquired Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be, as we do further work, that one of these has a story we haven\u2019t quite uncovered yet, maybe they are the missing link.\n\u201cThey could come up in further investigative work but at this stage it would be fair to say that we probably think the missing link is still unknown and that worries us.\u201d\nThe Queensland health minister, Yvette D\u2019Ath, said health authorities were also working to contact trace the woman who flew from Cairns and tested positive for the virus.\nQueensland reported a new local Covid-19 case on Saturday: a woman in her 20s from Goondiwindi, a town on the border of Queensland and NSW.\nThe woman tested positive while in quarantine, but D\u2019ath warned that she may have had one day out in the community while infectious.\nSpeaking outside a Bunnings store that was hosting a pop-up vaccination clinic, the Queensland health minister urged residents to get tested.\n\u201cThe message remains clear, if you have any symptoms and if you have been in the town since the 30 October or anywhere in Brisbane, please come out and get tested,\u201d D\u2019Ath said. \u201cWe still have nine active cases.\u201d\nVictoria recorded 1,268 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases and seven related deaths on Saturday, bringing the total number of active cases to 16,662.\nVictorian authorities confirmed that, as of Friday, there were 651 people in hospital, including 106 in intensive care. Of these, 70 were on a ventilator.\nOf the cases in hospital, authorities said 84% were not fully vaccinated, while 96% of those in intensive care had not received both jabs.\nIn NSW, authorities reported 270 new local infections on Saturday. Three more people with Covid-19 died, none of whom were fully vaccinated.\nThere were 270 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital in the state. Authorities said 55 people were in intensive care, 27 of whom required ventilation.\nThe ACT also recorded 18 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of active cases in the territory to 136. There were only two people in ACT hospitals with the virus, one of whom was on a ventilator.\nOn Saturday morning, Australia reached a double vaccination dose rate of 80.16% in people aged 16 and over, the prime minister\u2019s office said, with a further 9% having received at least one vaccine dose.\nScott Morrison said the vaccination rate was \u201canother magnificent milestone\u201d.\n\u201cThis has been a massive Australian national effort and the work doesn\u2019t stop here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on track to have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.\n\u201cNinety-nine per cent of Australians aged over 70 have had a first jab and over 90% have had a second. That is just extraordinary.\u201d\nBut vaccination rates vary significantly state-to-state, and are critically low in some communities.\nAs of Friday, the ACT was leading the way in terms of vaccinations, with almost 95% of over 16-year-olds having received both jabs.\nA total of 89% of those over 16 in New South Wales, 83% in Victoria, 77% in Tasmania and 66% in Queensland were fully vaccinated.\nBy comparison, only 65% of residents over 16 had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\nNew data from the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) shows concerning low vaccination rates in Indigenous Australians, two months after \u201csurge\u201d efforts from authorities to target 30 Aboriginal communities nationwide.\nAnalysis of the most recent data by Guardian Australia shows that the surge effort has produced some positive results, but the gap between the Indigenous and the overall vaccination rates remains high.\nOverall, there is a 19 percentage point difference between the Indigenous and overall first-dose vaccination rates in most of the priority areas.",

Now the phenomenon has a name: \u201cskimpflation\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a simple in concept \u2013 struggling with shortages of workers and goods, companies are skimping on what they offer consumers while, in many cases, charging the same price or more for that service.\nBut skimpflation may have profound consequences, and may even go some way to account for the rising tide consumer of dissatisfaction seen in increasing air rage incidents and even the Biden administration\u2019s plummeting poll numbers.\nSkimpflation is everywhere. Last weekend, American Airlines cancelled upwards of 2,000 flights, leaving thousands stranded, as a single weather event (high winds in Dallas) threw the carrier\u2019s rotas of pilots and flight attendants, already in short supply, into chaos. But passengers weren\u2019t the only ones affected. Crews found themselves having to work double shifts or stuck far from home at the end of work.\nAll of this, says Alan Cole, a writer at Full Stack Economics and formerly a senior economist at the joint economic committee of the US Congress, is part and parcel of the skimpflation, a sometimes subtle, sometimes overt, sense among consumers that they are getting less for their money, worker unhappiness with consumers and employers, employers\u2019 unhappiness with restive workers. It\u2019s an economic force that leaves everyone feeling they are getting the bad end of the transaction.\n\u201cNothing prepared us for how much life has gotten worse,\u201d Cole told the Guardian. \u201cMost of these factors haven\u2019t been picked up on by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We thought these changes to products were going to be temporary, so it was reasonable not to account for the changes. But now everything has got worse all at the same time, so even if you tried to account for them, you probably couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nEven if skimpflation cannot be measured conveniently, consumers have certainly noticed that the quality of service seems to be deteriorating everywhere. Consumer satisfaction indices are trending down, as they have been since before the onset of the pandemic, while consumer confidence was mildly better last month after dropping over the summer.\nAt the same time, exit polls from the upset in the Virginia governors race this week showed that one-third of voters registered the economy as their chief concern. With the job market still 7 million workers down from pre-pandemic employment levels, inflation running at a 30-year high, and worker dissatisfaction triggering a mass resignation, circumstances could get worse.\nAs National Public Radio noted last week, Domino\u2019s is taking longer to deliver pizzas; airlines are putting call-in customers on hold for hours, and restaurants, bars and hotels are understaffed.\nAnd that\u2019s before the holiday season, when yet more Americans are likely to run into examples of skimpflation in travel, present buying and entertainment.\nIn a September column, Cole confessed to becoming \u201can inflation crank\u201d after he stayed at an upscale hotel. \u201cThe breakfast was comically unimpressive: little more than some individual cereal boxes, a limited assortment of poorly cooled beverages, and paper dishware,\u201d he wrote. Some of these degradations come, he argues, with a plausible Covid-19 justification but they are also down to companies reducing labor costs.\nIn economic terms, the balance of power between supply and demand may have shifted post-pandemic. Cole reasons that consumers had become accustomed to a slick services culture and cheaper goods that are harder to support with the rollback of globalizationtriggered by the supply chain issues affecting western consumer economies. Employers had become used to having the upper hand with workers keen to keep their jobs and buy those cheap goods and services.\n\u201cThat has unwound,\u201d he says.\nSuccessive rounds of stimulus cash from Washington flushed money into the economy at a time when capacity was constrained by Covid. Now that the pandemic is (hopefully) waning those consumers have cash to spend and workers have more job opportunities. \u201cSo now we\u2019re seeing the opposite balance of power, especially if you have a house to sell or you\u2019re a worker in the food service industry,\u201d Cole says.\nTo the consumer, who are sensitive to losses of services and generally take improvements for granted, the effects of skimpflation can be traumatic.\n\u201cWe expect civilizational progress, but this was an unusual case of a new development affecting the real economy that was obviously negative,\u201d Cole says. The new world is still one of masks and vaccine mandates, workers remain anxious about Covid, and fear \u2013 and its close cousin anger \u2013 is everywhere.\nA small business owner offering more money or flexible working conditions is likely to feel that workers who don\u2019t show up are being unreasonable. But workers are, conversely, likely to feel that they\u2019re being endangered at worst or inconvenienced at best.\n\u201cThere are lots of non-wage dimensions to jobs and normally they\u2019re not that big of a deal,\u201d says Cole. \u201cNow they\u2019re all being renegotiated, with new conveniences and inconveniences to be argued about. That raises the transactions costs on both sides. So it\u2019s possible for both sides to feel they\u2019ve made sacrifices and to feel unhappy about the situation. But it\u2019s really not one or the other, it\u2019s just that the world has got worse.\u201d",

        "content": "A livestreamed session at Cop26 sets out to educate and inspire tomorrow\u2019s leaders, from Ukraine to Peru\n\u201cType your favourite crunchiness of peanut butter into the chat thread,\u201d says Matthew Shribman to a global classroom of children, as the scientist and teacher kicks off the Great Big Lesson for Nature at Cop26 in Glasgow.\nThousands of schoolchildren from across the world have joined the virtual lesson broadcast live from the nature pavilion in the blue zone, right next to where world leaders make decisions that affect these young people\u2019s future.\nAt the classroom entrance, a sign reads: \u201cChairs have been fashioned for kings and queens and leaders for millennia. The chairs you are sitting on today have been used by schoolchildren. It\u2019s time to put yourself in their shoes \u2013 as well as their seats.\u201d\nFour thousand schools from countries including the UK, Ukraine, Brazil and Peru, registered for the one-hour lesson broadcast on YouTube. It is hosted by AimHi Earth, a climate education organisation, and backed by the Potsdam Institute in Germany and Cambridge University in England. Educators from India, Peru, Malaysia, Indonesia and Qatar all contribute to the lesson, which is delivered in partnership with World\u2019s Largest Lesson, Nature4Climate and Youthtopia.\nThere are the usual glitches \u2013 the internet drops out, teachers forget they are on mute \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t stop the message getting across. Shribman, the lead teacher, says: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important we\u2019re making rock stars out of these young change makers, getting them in front of thousands of people telling the truth in a way that is engaging and powerful. To have these people from around the world teaching young people through this stage of Cop26 is so powerful.\u201d\nAfter the peanut butter ice-breaker question, the young crowd discuss a range of environmental issues including how the sex of sea turtles is determined by heat \u2013 the hotter the temperatures, the more likely they are to be female; in some parts of the world the ratio of male to female turtles is one to 100. Teachers talk about geoengineering, carbon capture and storage, \u201csponge cities\u201d, what healthy soils look like, as well as offsetting and why we should eat less meat.\nFriday\u2019s youth day event is for young people over the age of 11. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think of hundreds of thousands of kids watching this live from Cop26,\u201d says Sarah Humphrys, co-founder of AimHi Earth. \u201cIt\u2019s about us bringing the conversation to them. The blue zone feels very exclusive, especially for young people, so this was a chance to bring them into this space.\u201d\nThe team also runs adult classes, and has been working with members from the UK\u2019s House of Lords. \u201cThe response has been fantastic. It has enabled people to link these ideas together. People at the top of the leadership don\u2019t understand the crisis, through no fault of their own. It\u2019s because the education system is not giving people the information they need,\u201d says Shribman.\nOrganisers hope that the population will be better able to drive change if they understand the issues, and they are campaigning for more education on the environment in schools. The government is considering whether to introduce a GCSE in natural history.\n\u201cCop26 is sadly not a meeting of people coming together to try to work to stop the climate and nature crisis,\u201d says Shribman. \u201cIt\u2019s a meeting of people coming together trying to hold on to as much as they possibly can. And in some ways there are many inspiring people here doing all they can to build a healthy, more verdant future that we all want, but there is a lot of work to do while leaders still make selfish decisions.\u201d\nThe online lesson focuses on nature, because Shribman believes it is at the centre of the climate crisis. \u201cThe scariest thing about Cop26 is that people think we can control the climate crisis just thinking about carbon. Imagine the world we will get to if that\u2019s all we think about? There will be no nature, and the world will be an unhealthy place, but at least we\u2019ve got to net zero,\u201d he says.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "content": "Analysis: the \u2018significant outcomes\u2019 came thick and fast but there are question marks about credibility\nLong before delegates gathered in Glasgow, the scene for Cop26 was set by the starkest warning yet from the world\u2019s scientists that human activity was unequivocally disrupting the climate, extreme weather was growing more intense, and urgent action was needed to prevent still worse chaos in the future.\n\u201cCode red,\u201d declared the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, as evidence mounted this summer of ever fiercer heatwaves and increasingly deadly storms and floods. No pressure, then, on the climate diplomats who were told they represented the \u201clast best chance\u201d of holding global heating to 1.5C.\nIn Cops past, world leaders would wait until the final few days before showing up and then roll up their sleeves, hypercaffeinate and thrash out a deal through the night and into the early morning. This was great for macho posturing, but not so good when things broke down and there was no time to fix them. Today\u2019s statesmen and women are less hands on. They show up during the early phase of the Cop, which is all about handshakes, photo ops and mood-making rhetoric.\nEnter the host nation\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, who opened the event with references to James Bond and being 5-1 down at half-time in a football game, before finally getting to the point: \u201cIt\u2019s one minute to midnight on that Doomsday Clock and we need to act now.\u201d\nThe good news at Glasgow was that the United States had emerged from its Trumpian sulk to claim centre stage. \u201cLet this be the moment that we answer history\u2019s call here in Glasgow,\u201d proclaimed Joe Biden. This is important because nothing of substance can be done without the world\u2019s greatest historical emitter, biggest economy and most powerful military, but the projection of potency was somewhat undermined by the squeeze that Joe Manchin, a fossil-fuel-loving senator from Biden\u2019s own party, had on the president\u2019s bold climate plans.\nEven with a stronger US presence, the global roll call remained incomplete. If this were a school register, the teacher would note that some the naughtiest kids in the climate class were all absent: Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro, president of the world\u2019s biggest deforesting nation; Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of the world\u2019s second biggest oil pumper; and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, president of the world\u2019s second biggest gas producer. China\u2019s Xi Jinping, president of the biggest coal consumer and carbon emitter, was also missing, though at least he had a sicknote owing to the Covid crisis.\nIndia provided the biggest fillip of the high-level segment when its prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced that the country would get 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and go net zero by 2070. That is three generations away, but still a big advance compared with previous plans. Along with the unveiling of Nigeria\u2019s first carbon-neutral plan this week, countries representing more than 70% of the world\u2019s emissions have now signed up to long-term goals.\nIf Cops have any value, it is in forcing those who have profited from the climate crisis to look into the eyes of the victims. But are the leaders of the US, EU and China and the CEOs of Exxon, Shell and BP still able to see? This was the question posed by Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, in an opening-day speech that brought goosebumps to many of those watching.\n\u201cAre we so blinded and hardened that we can no longer appreciate the cries of humanity?\u201d she said, castigating those who had failed to act sooner and still hesitated to finance a transition to clean energy. She said the cost was now being measured in lives and livelihoods in small island nations. \u201cThis is immoral, and it is unjust,\u201d she said.\nWhatever its other failings (chaotic entry delays, restricted access, etc), nobody could accuse this Cop of lacking a clear narrative arc. The rollout of announcements has been cunningly scripted to give the impression of progress \u2013 or as Johnson put it, pulling back goals to reduce the half-time deficit. The first was a declaration on ending deforestation by 2030. At first sight this sounded an awful lot like the 2014 New York declaration on forests to, er, end deforestation by 2030, which has so far failed to halve tree clearance, currently at a rate of 30 football pitches a minute, according to Zac Goldsmith.\nBut there are some important differences. This time there is some serious money behind the plan \u2013 $19.2bn from governments and the private sector, most of the major forest nations are signed up, and there is an extra package of more than $1bn for indigenous communities, who are the most effective forest guardians. There are also long overdue steps towards the creation of sustainable supply chains and deforestation-free international trade, though a lot more detail and buy-in is needed in this area.\nThere are bigger question marks about credibility. India has stayed away. Indonesia has already wobbled over its commitment. And can anyone trust Brazil under Bolsonaro, after he has spent the past three years smoking the Amazon?\nBy midweek the momentum-building \u201csignificant outcomes\u201d were coming thick and fast. The highlight on Wednesday was an alliance of more than 90 nations, covering two-thirds of the global economy, committing to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade.\nThis buys the world a little time because methane is a particularly potent greenhouse gas, though it should really have been done earlier. That it wasn\u2019t probably has something to do with the powerful vested interests linked to the main sources \u2013 gas and oil wells, pipelines, livestock burps and farts, and municipal landfill sites.\nThe US will lead the way by obliging companies to plug leaks in more than 3m miles of pipelines. China, India and Russia decided to sit out the methane pledge on the grounds that wealthier nations should be leading the way. Brazil, though, is in, seemingly now signing up to everything.\nIt was not just the mood that was lifted by this and other announcements: several climate models projected that the extra ambition unveiled in the first few days of Glasgow had the potential to restrain global heating to less than 2C for the first time. Hurrah! But before getting too excited, bear in mind that the calculation is based on the heroic assumption that every government in the world will keep their promises.\nAnother day, another outcome. More than 40 countries agreed to phase out coal-fired power. Canada, South Korea, Ukraine, Indonesia and Vietnam said they would quit this dirtiest form of fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040. Even Poland signed up, which is remarkable given its devotion to coal was so great as recently as 2018 that it staged the Cop of that year in the colliery city of Katowice and treated climate delegates to an exhibition on the beauty and importance of this fuel.\nOther nations promised to halve financing of coal plants overseas. Killing off Old King Coal is essential for 1.5C, but Glasgow will not be the site of assassination. The US, China, Australia and India keep coal alive outside this agreement, but the alliance will try to wear them down.\nMeanwhile, progress was being made, according to the IEA, which announced that the extra commitments made so far could take warming down to 1.8C. One UN special adviser was having none of this: the world remained on \u201ca 2.7 degree pathway, a catastrophic pathway\u201d, he said.\nThousand of young protesters marched through Glasgow to demand urgent climate action. Civil society organisations have been largely kept away from the main conference centre all week. Many of their activities are staged on the other side of the Clyde.\nBut Saturday is expected to see tens of thousands arrive in the city for the biggest demonstration yet. Frustrations at the lack of action are evident. Greta Thunberg has accused Cop attenders of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d.\nInside the main conference centre, the mood is cautious. The UK organisers are relieved that major slip-ups have been avoided. The African group of nations is optimistic that progress has been made. Everyone is aware that there is still a big credibility gap between the more ambitious long-term promises and short-term actions.\nThe second week will be crucial in closing that gap as Cop switches from show-and-tell mode to technical and political negotiations over detail. The big battles lie ahead \u2013 on the climate rulebook, on carbon credit trading systems, on questions of loss and damage, and most of all on climate finance \u2013 whether the rich nations largely responsible for the climate crisis will provide sufficient funds for poor, vulnerable and developing nations to switch to renewable energy and cope with the rising storm to come.\nThere has been progress this week, but not nearly enough. The success or failure of this Cop will decided by emissions cuts, not outcomes. More pressure needed.",

        "content": "Politician says droughts and climate-induced famine in the country are a result of the behaviours of rich nations\nMore than a million people facing the first climate-induced famine in Madagascar are paying the price for cheap flights in Europe and appliances such as gas heaters, the country\u2019s environment minister has said.\nFor several years now, the south of Madagascar has suffered successive droughts of increasing severity, and the situation has deteriorated sharply over the last few months. In August, the UN said the country was facing the world\u2019s first climate change famine. On Tuesday, a World Food Programme representative spoke of a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d visit to the country.\nSpeaking to the Guardian at Cop26, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, Madagascar\u2019s minister for the environment and sustainable development, said the failure of rich countries to meet a $100bn climate finance target means her country cannot afford to build a water pipeline to alleviate the island\u2019s worst drought in 40 years.\nDeveloped countries have been promising to deliver the $100bn in climate finance to help countries such as Madagascar adapt since 2009, but last week that target was delayed yet again.\nRaharinirina said a pipeline that would bring water from the north of the island to the drought-stricken south would cost $900m, and the country could not afford it. \u201cI was wondering three days ago during a negotiation session why it is so difficult for rich countries to pay this money. It\u2019s not aid. It\u2019s accountability,\u201d she said. \u201cMy opinion is that in the north, there is a psychological distance to the problem. People see documentary and pictures but do not feel it like we feel it when I go to the southern part of my country.\u201d\nShe added there was a dissonance between the behaviour of Europeans and Americans and the consequences for people in the global south such as Malagasies enduring 45-degree temperatures all year round with little rainfall, calling for the global north to reflect on how countries such as Madagascar can live \u201cwith dignity\u201d.\n\u201cPeople from the deep south of Madagascar are victims of something that they didn\u2019t do,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey move to the west of Madagascar and it\u2019s a real risk to the biodiversity. When they move, they directly go to the protected areas where they can find resources like wood and medicinal plants \u2013 things that are normally forbidden,\u201d she said.\nMadagascar is the fifth largest island in the world and is home to many animals and plants found nowhere else on Earth. More than 600 new species were discovered between 1999 and 2010.\nRaharinirina argued that cheap flights in the global north should be banned and asked Britons not to fly to popular holiday destinations such as Spain. \u201cWe should forbid the low-cost flights where you sometimes have two people go from Paris to Madrid or from Edinburgh to Vienna. It\u2019s a high-cost flight for people in my country. They pay the price of that.\n\u201cIn September, I was attending the IUCN congress in Marseille, and I was totally shocked to see people dining outside restaurants that they are heating [with gas]. This should be illegal,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere are many things that should be changed in the way of life of many European or North American or Chinese people. You have to make a choice or have to make a sacrifice.\u201d\nThis article was edited on Monday 8 November 2021 to correct a figure given in error.

Her vote helped elect the seemingly progressive Democrat from Arizona to the Senate in 2018. But she wonders what happened to Sinema when she got to Washington.\nYoung, a voting rights activist and citizen of the Din\u00e9, or Navajo Nation, is appalled by Sinema\u2019s refusal to reform or abolish the filibuster.\n\u201cShe has betrayed her constituents,\u201d Young, 31, said by phone this week. \u201cThe sort of inaction that she\u2019s taking right now is an action and it\u2019s making the BIPOC community, especially in Arizona, distrust her more and more as the days go by.\u201d\nRepublicans have deployed the filibuster to block legislation brought by Democrats to safeguard voting rights four times this year. On Wednesday they thwarted debate on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named after the civil rights hero and congressman.\nIt is an issue that hits home for Young, who last year organized a second \u201cRide to the Polls\u201d campaign in Arizona that led Indigenous people more than 20 miles on horseback to polling places so they could cast their votes.\n\u201cHer campaign was something that attracted us because back then she seemed to be a little more progressive than she is now. That\u2019s the part that we\u2019re all having trouble understanding. What happened?\u201d\nThe bewilderment deepened late last year when Sinema nominated Young for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society\u2019s Citizen Honors Award for her contribution to increasing voter registration and turnout. Young reflected: \u201cThe fact that nomination came from her and her office tells me that she knows the importance of the Native vote.\u201d\n\u201c[But] she\u2019s not protecting our right to vote and, if she doesn\u2019t end the filibuster and these voting rights acts don\u2019t get passed, that will affect us. We\u2019re already seeing some of these voter suppression laws that have been passed earlier this year and how they will affect the Native vote.\u201d\nThis has led to the oft-asked question: what does Sinema really want? \u201cA lot of folks are talking about how she\u2019s trying to stay bipartisan. She thinks that\u2019s the key to everything that\u2019s happening in the divisiveness that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Young says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very devastating to all of us Arizonans and those who trusted in her. That\u2019s the point of this election process. We vote in and we elect leaders that should be held accountable and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now. We put faith in a leader that\u2019s going to show up for us and protect us and fight for us and we\u2019re not seeing that right now.\u201d\nEarlier this year the US supreme court upheld Arizona laws that ban the collection of absentee ballots by anyone other than a relative or caregiver, and reject any ballots cast in the wrong precinct.\nRepublicans, who control the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature in Arizona, are also pushing to end same-day voter registration, a move that would hurt the Navajo Nation, with 170,000 people and 110 communities spread over 27,000 square miles, mostly in Arizona.\nYoung explained: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get to the poll. It\u2019s difficult to get anywhere, to even get to a hospital or a clinic or a grocery store, so making multiple trips to ensure that our vote is counted is nearly impossible for a lot of people.\u201d\nYoung argued the case for protecting voting rights with Kamala Harris at a White House meeting and is collecting signatures of Navajo leaders to register their discontent with Sinema. She welcomes the prospect of another Democrat challenging her in a primary election one day.\nThe filibuster, which is not in the US constitution, enables the Senate minority to block debate on legislation. Barack Obama has called it \u201ca Jim Crow relic\u201d, a reference to its long history of thwarting civil rights legislation.\nApart from blocking voting rights legislations, Republicans have used it to block the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate the 6 January insurrection at the US this year. Activists regard eliminating the procedure as crucial to other issues including immigration reform and reproductive rights.\nIn a CNN town hall last month, Biden indicated willingness to \u201cfundamentally alter the filibuster\u201d, adding that it \u201cremains to be seen exactly what that means in terms of fundamentally \u2013 on whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up\u201d.\nBut just as on his economic agenda, senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sinema stand in his way. Both have repeatedly defended the filibuster, with Sinema arguing that it \u201cprotects the democracy of our nation rather than allowing our country to ricochet wildly every two to four years\u201d.\nJust Democracy, a coalition led by Black and brown organizers, is coordinating with Arizona groups to step up the pressure on her to reconsider.\nThis includes a psychological thriller-style parody movie trailer, The Betrayal, about Sinema turning her back on people of color in Arizona, ending with: \u201cNow playing in Sinemas near you.\u201d It will be backed by an advertising campaign in Arizona and run alongside horror content on the streaming service Hulu.\nChannel Powe, 40, a local organizer, former Arizona school board member and spokesperson for Just Democracy, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it politically impossible for Senator Sinema to continue to stand by the filibuster. In this week of action we are creating a surround sound effect that pushes Senator Sinema on the filibuster. We wanted to share the terrifying consequences of the world that Sinema is enabling.\u201d\nPowe added: \u201cOnce upon a time, she was a mentor of mine in a 2011 political fellowship that I participated in. I looked up to her. Kyrsten used to be a fierce fighter for the people. But once she got to Congress, she turned her back on the very same people who helped her get her in office.\u201d",

        "content": "She was Hillary Clinton\u2019s aide and the wife of a star politician when a sexting scandal sent him to prison, destroyed their marriage \u2013 and derailed her boss\u2019s bid to become president. How did she cope?\nWalk of shame, huh? I\u2019ll take it,\u201d says Huma Abedin, reading the name of the lipstick on the makeup artist\u2019s table. It is a bright, cool day in Manhattan and we are at a photographer\u2019s studio, where Abedin is having her photo taken for this interview. Having watched her from afar for so long, first as Hillary Clinton\u2019s elegant, silent assistant, then as the mostly silent and increasingly unhappy spouse of the former congressman Anthony Weiner, I had expected her to be quiet, anxious and guarded, but Abedin, 45, is none of those things. Someone so beautiful could come across as imperious, but with her big, open-mouthed laugh and \u201cOh gosh, you know better than me!\u201d air, she veers closer to goofy. After 25 years of working for Clinton, she has a politician\u2019s knack for making those around her feel comfortable. She leans forward keenly when spoken to, and makes sure to use everyone\u2019s name when talking to them. She tells us, twice, that she ate \u201cso much comfort food over the weekend at the hospital\u201d, where she waited while Bill Clinton was being treated for a urological infection; he was discharged the day before our interview. \u201cJust burgers and fries, burgers and fries. Food is my weakness,\u201d she says rolling her eyes at herself. Everyone is instantly disarmed. But then she picks up that lipstick and at the word \u201cshame\u201d the makeup artist and I look down awkwardly and Abedin becomes \u2013 as she has been for so long, she tells me later over lunch \u2013 \u201cthe elephant in the room again\u201d. \u201cI lived with shame for a very, very long time,\u201d as she puts it.\nThe question Abedin hears most is: why? Why did she stay with Weiner after he accidentally tweeted a photo of his crotch while sexting women online in 2011, leading to his resignation from Congress? Why, when he ran for New York City mayor in 2013, did she assure voters that she had \u201cforgiven him\u201d? And why did she stay with him when it then emerged he was still sending women photos of the contents of his trousers? Why did she only separate from him but not divorce him when, in 2016, he sent a woman a photo of himself aroused while lying in bed next to his and Abedin\u2019s toddler son, Jordan? And why were there official emails between her and Hillary on Weiner\u2019s laptop, thereby prompting the then director of the FBI, James Comey, to announce the fateful reopening of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails days before the 2016 election?\nWell, her new memoir, Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds, makes a good fist of answering most, if not all, of these questions. Having started the book believing that Abedin\u2019s choices were so unrelatable as to be incomprehensible, I finished it feeling as if I probably would have often done the same. This is the first interview she has given about her book: \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not a TV one, because that\u2019s really not me, being in front of the camera,\u201d she says. I ask why she decided to write the book at all, given that it would, inevitably, thrust her right back into the bright glare of public scrutiny.\n\u201cI think if I\u2019d written this book when people wanted me to write it, in the midst of all the heat and intensity, it would have been a much more bitter book. I needed the time. But I feel like I\u2019m somebody who\u2019s been in the public eye on and off for the past 20 years and someone else has been writing my story, and it felt like the right time for me to write it,\u201d she says.\nIn order to understand what she did, Abedin says, as she eats her omelette and chips in a downtown restaurant, you have to understand where she came from. People tend to start with her long relationship with Hillary Clinton, who she has worked for since she was 20 years old, and think that shaped how she handled her own husband\u2019s very public betrayals of her. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s hard not to boggle at the symbolism that she was working at the White House when the president, after initial denials, finally admitted he\u2019d had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. But Abedin loathes this line of thinking. \u201cI know that people want to make this comparison\u201d \u2013 between Bill Clinton\u2019s scandal and Weiner\u2019s \u2013 \u201cbecause it seems to the outside world so similar, but to me it wasn\u2019t,\u201d she insists. Instead, she says, to really understand how she, a devout Muslim, was married to an American Jew who ended up in prison for sex offences, you have to go back to her beginnings.\nAbedin was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the daughter of two professors, both India-born Muslims. When she was two, her parents were offered jobs at the university in Jeddah and so the family moved to Saudi Arabia. Her parents raised her to be devout but also modern; she has no problem, she writes, with women who opt to wear the hijab as long as they have \u201cthe choice\u201d. When she was 17, her father died from progressive renal failure, which her parents had kept hidden from the children for most of their childhood. I ask what she learned from her father and she says: \u201cTo make your own choices, but be thoughtful about them, not rash.\u201d\nHer mother encouraged her to go to university in the US and she went to George Washington University in Washington DC. She\u2019d spent her summers in the US, so the culture shock wasn\u2019t too great, but because of her faith she doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, which differentiated her from the other American students. There was something else, too: \u201cAs was expected of any girl with my background, I would lose my virginity to the man I would marry,\u201d she writes, and that is exactly what she did, waiting until she married Weiner at the age of 33.\nShe applied to be a White House intern while still at college, and was assigned to the first lady\u2019s deputy chief of staff. She was offered a permanent position even before she graduated. \u201cI officially became a member of a lifelong club known as Hillaryland,\u201d she writes. From the moment she arrived, Abedin was in awe of the Clintons, Hillary especially, and it\u2019s an impression that has not waned in the 25 years she has spent working alongside her. She tells me that one of the reasons she wrote her memoir \u201cwas to show the world that she\u2019s this incredible person, and I wanted to present her as a human, away from the caricatures\u201d. But it\u2019s hard to see the human when so many of the descriptions of her in the book sound like a press release (\u201cDiplomacy is about meeting the world with open eyes, attuned listening and small gestures of outreach. It was second nature to Hillary Clinton\u201d). This is also how she talks about her in person. The only criticism Abedin allows of Hillary in the book is of her occasionally unfortunate taste in clothes (\u201cthe coat that looked like a carpet that HRC thought was colourful and fun\u201d). Meanwhile, her attendance at Donald Trump\u2019s wedding to Melania Knauss (\u201cWhen the invitation came [Hillary] figured, why not? When someone is getting married, you go\u201d) and even her vote for the war against Iraq (\u201cshe was clear about her reservations\u201d), which Abedin advised against, are justified. From very early on, the two women developed a close relationship based on mutual respect, and it\u2019s easy to see why Abedin \u2013 a young woman who lost her father and was living far away from her mother \u2013 would cleave to the Clintons.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily politically motivated. It felt like [being part of] the cause, and every day you were doing something important,\u201d she says, and that cause was the Clintons.\nYet her devotion to the cause occasionally crashes up against historical fact, and in the case of the Clintons in the late 1990s, that means Lewinsky. Abedin does her best to get around this when recalling how rumours of the president\u2019s affair with the intern began. \u201cGiven all the manufactured stories that had come before this one \u2013 that the Clintons were murderers, thieves \u2013 it seemed very likely that this one could be untrue,\u201d she writes.\nCome on, I say. By the time Lewinsky came along, the president had already been accused of sexual impropriety by Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones (the latter of which he still denies). There must have been some part of Abedin that thought Lewinsky was telling the truth.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replies before I finish the question.\nWhy not?\n\u201cFor me, as an intern, it seemed not possible. We never saw [the president]! You would turn on the TV and it was Ken Starr this, Ken Starr that, Whitewater this, Whitewater that \u2013 but when you turned away from the TV and you looked at your desk, really important work was continuing. Northern Ireland, the Middle East peace process. The other stuff was just distractions on TV. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t been an intern it would have been different, but I knew how it was [in the White House] and it seemed impossible,\u201d she says. Throughout our time together, she never says Lewinsky\u2019s name. I ask how the Clintons feel about Ryan Murphy\u2019s recent dramatisation of the scandal in Impeachment: American Crime Story. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conversation that we discussed internally,\u201d she replies crisply.\nWhen the Democrats gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, despite the impeachment, Abedin knew exactly who to credit. \u201cIt was Hillary Clinton\u2019s effort, her struggle and her strategising, her broken and open heart that had saved the presidency \u2026 Hillary Clinton was the saviour, not the liability,\u201d she writes, channelling her internal Barbara Cartland.\nAs I read this sentence out loud to her, Abedin quotes it along with me. \u201cHer broken heart, yeah,\u201d she says smiling a little.\nThis idea that Hillary had, through forgiveness and loyalty, fixed her husband\u2019s transgression and saved his career seems to echo your later belief that you could fix your husband and rescue his political career, I say to her.\n\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d she says excitedly, as if she\u2019d never put those ideas together.\nSo did seeing how Hillary handled her husband\u2019s infidelity \u2013 silently, stoically \u2013 influence how Abedin later dealt with Weiner?\n\u201cIf it did, it was subconscious. I think what really drove me was I was desperately in love with my husband. I think all of the ugliness from the outside, it made us into a bubble. I didn\u2019t know who I could trust, and so much of the conversation was so embarrassing, so we kind of receded into our corner,\u201d she says.\nThe first time Weiner asked Abedin on a date was in 2001. She declined, saying she was busy working for Hillary. So he loudly asked Hillary to give Abedin the night off, and Hillary, to Abedin\u2019s horror, told her to go have fun. She managed to shake off the obnoxious congressman that night, but they bumped into one another frequently at political events. She was the quiet, well-liked aide who hid from the spotlight; he was the brash congressman who yelled about his political causes to any passing camera. And yet, by 2007, they were friendly, and she was falling for him. He was not fazed by her job, which was extremely demanding, given that Hillary was now a senator and also running for the presidency. \u201cOther men would find this whole Clinton world really overwhelming and more than they could handle,\u201d she says. Also, unlike other men, he had no problem with what she describes as her \u201climitations\u201d \u2013 her decision not to have sex until she was married. The man who would soon be routinely described as a sex addict in the media didn\u2019t even kiss her until a year into their relationship. \u201cAnd he was fine with that,\u201d she says. She\u2019d always assumed she\u2019d marry a Muslim, so he gave up alcohol and pork, and fasted during Ramadan alongside her. When he proposed, in 2009, she accepted. \u201cIt was a real journey for me to get to a place where I could allow myself to marry someone outside my faith. But he was my first love, and my greatest soulmate \u2026 Then everything exploded. He didn\u2019t just break my heart, he ripped it out and stomped on it over and over again,\u201d she says calmly.\nThe first warning sign came as they were discussing their wedding plans and she handed him his BlackBerry to call his dad. Her eye was caught by an email from a woman. It was \u201cfawning, flirtatious and very familiar\u201d, she writes. He insisted it was \u201cjust a fan\u201d. Because he was known for being a straight talker \u2013 to a fault \u2013 she believed him. But later, she would remember what he said to her right before she saw that email: \u201cI\u2019m broken and I need you to fix me.\u201d Has she ever asked him what he meant?\n\u201cOften I\u2019ll raise things with Anthony, and I think there\u2019s a lot he doesn\u2019t remember. But I think, in hindsight, it really was a self-realisation that something didn\u2019t feel right, and my guess is that committing to me, committing to being married, exposed those vulnerabilities: \u2018Am I good enough to be in a relationship with somebody?\u2019 That\u2019s what a lot of people who have these insecurities feel,\u201d she says.\nSoon after, they got married and their wedding was officiated by none other than \u2026 Bill Clinton. \u201cEvery wedding is a wonder,\u201d intoned the man who, just over a decade earlier, had been impeached for lying about infidelity. I tell Abedin that often when she describes Weiner in the book \u2013 \u201ccharming, charismatic and clearly attractive to lots of women\u201d \u2013 it sounds like she could be describing Bill. Was that part of his appeal?\n\u201cNo! Not at all!\u201d she gasps. She was, she says, just deeply in love with him.\nOnly 10 months into their marriage, Weiner texted Abedin to say his Twitter account had been hacked. This, of course, was a lie, and after a few days he had to admit, to his wife and then the public, that the person who had posted a photo of Anthony Weiner\u2019s crotch to Anthony Weiner\u2019s Twitter account was Anthony Weiner. The media cackled. Abedin cringed. Then the New York Times found out she was pregnant and, even though she was still in her first trimester, they printed it, and that\u2019s how the Clintons and most of her friends found out. But she didn\u2019t leave him. It was, Weiner told her, just an online thing, like a computer game, and he was sorry. It\u2019s not like he had sex with someone else, she told herself. Abedin had barely dated at all before Weiner and he was, she writes in the book, her \u201cfirst and only\u201d. I ask if she thinks this inexperience caused her to be naive about her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was naive \u2013 I think I wasn\u2019t rash. Also, because I lost my father when I was young and that was such an important relationship in my life, I thought: \u2018Am I going to deprive this child of a father, without giving him another chance?\u2019 I feel I made a very thoughtful decision about it.\u201d He resigned from Congress, they went into therapy, and six months later their son, Jordan, was born.\nA few months after that, it was Abedin who was in the spotlight when five Republican members of Congress, including former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, wrote a letter saying Abedin should be investigated for possible terrorist \u201cinfiltration\u201d of the state department. \u201cAbedin has three family members \u2013 her late father, her mother and her brother \u2013 connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organisations,\u201d they wrote.\nThis was complete nonsense: none of Abedin\u2019s family had any connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. Looking back now, Abedin sees this episode as a precursor to the heightened Islamaphobia that would soon unfold in the US: \u201cMichele Bachmann was the appetiser for what came next, and I was the experiment.\u201d\nFor so long, Abedin had been, she says, \u201cthe token Muslim in American politics\u201d. Hillary trusted her expertise on the Middle East and she often acted as translator on trips to the region. But now American politicians and some foreign ones were questioning her loyalty. Senator John McCain gave a speech to the Senate defending her: \u201cHuma represents what is best about America \u2026 I am proud to call her my friend.\u201d More Republicans, including Lindsey Graham and the then House speaker John Boehner, spoke up for her, and the scandal faded. It was a testament to how well liked Abedin was in the American political world, whereas her husband was totally isolated.\nWhen Weiner mooted the idea of running for mayor of New York in 2013, Abedin was enthusiastic. He was such a good politician, and what had happened in 2011 had clearly been an aberration, she thought. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine Anthony would do anything to risk it all again,\u201d she writes. Abedin, for the first time, made a public statement defending her husband. \u201cI love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him,\u201d she said at a press conference to persuade voters. Hillary was horrified and I ask Abedin why. After all, Hillary had stood by her husband after his infidelities. \u201cHillary has always approached how she tried to help me from the perspective of a friend, and she felt that I didn\u2019t need to do what I did,\u201d she says.\nI ask if Hillary ever mentioned to Abedin their shared experience of being married to chronically unfaithful husbands.\n\u201cNo. No. I don\u2019t think she \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be talking about private conversations with her. But she has this incredible empathy, compassion and problem-solving gene that she can\u2019t shake. There\u2019s no, \u2018This is what I did so you should do this.\u2019 No. She didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019d seen what she\u2019d gone through,\u201d she says.\nSoon after Abedin made her public statement of forgiveness, it emerged Weiner was still sexting. Abedin doesn\u2019t include this detail in the book \u2013 and who could blame her \u2013 but this time he was doing so under the unforgettable alias \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d. New Yorkers rejected the possibility of Mayor Danger.\nNo one could understand why she stayed \u2013 not even the Clintons, although they never said so explicitly. But no one in her family was divorced, and she just couldn\u2019t picture it for herself. She told Weiner in 2014 that she wanted a separation, but they still lived together. Outsiders tutted, but he made life easier for her. Abedin was extremely busy working for Clinton, now secretary of state and, imminently, presidential nominee. He was happy to stay home and look after their son while Abedin travelled the country. Anyone who has been married with kids will know that, for pragmatic purposes, you sometimes tolerate more than you should.\nA month after Hillary was named the Democratic nominee in the 2016 election, Weiner called Abedin. He told her the New York Post was publishing a picture of him and Jordan. She assumed it would be a paparazzi photo of the two of them in the park. It wasn\u2019t. It was a photo taken by Weiner showing himself aroused and in bed, and next to him lay their sleeping toddler son, and he had sent it to a woman on the internet. Abedin threw him out of their apartment and publicly announced their separation. Strangers called Child Services saying they were concerned for Jordan\u2019s safety, so now, while going through a very public scandal, and a separation, and helping to helm an especially fevered presidential campaign, she was also being investigated by Child Services. Just one of those things would drive most people to a nervous breakdown. How on earth did she not collapse?\n\u201cGod,\u201d she replies. \u201cMy faith has carried me through this life and, when I was at my lowest moments, that\u2019s where I went. I think the average American doesn\u2019t know about Islam, but, no question, that is where I find my balance.\u201d\nThings were about to get even worse for Abedin. A few weeks later, it was alleged that Weiner had been sexting a 15-year-old girl \u2013 a federal offence. \u201cEach time I thought Anthony had reached a new nadir, he shocked me by going even lower,\u201d Abedin writes.\nMaybe he was testing you to see how much you could take, I say.\n\u201cI think the isolation and the shunning from society made him retreat more into these spaces and, as a result, it felt as though whatever it was Anthony was dealing with, it was not being treated properly and we both had to get to the bottom,\u201d she says. He went into rehab and that was when doctors first told her that Weiner had an \u201caddiction\u201d. Does she think he\u2019s a sex addict?\n\u201cThere are certain questions for him to answer, not me. What I do know is that somebody who intentionally loses everything and falls into the same pattern again, that\u2019s not behaviour you can control,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s an addict\u2019s behaviour, but maybe not to sex, I say. Maybe he was addicted to self-destruction, or even public shame. She nods emphatically.\nBecause Weiner\u2019s alleged victim was underage, the FBI seized his laptop. When they found emails on it from Abedin to Hillary containing classified information, Comey announced he was reopening the investigation into Hillary\u2019s emails and whether she used a private server for official communications. The election was less than two weeks away. Abedin\u2019s two worlds \u2013 her Clinton world and her tattered marriage \u2013 had collided in the most spectacular fashion. Within days, Comey cleared Clinton, but the damage had been done.\nAbedin says she\u2019s put all her anger behind her, but she still sounds pretty angry when talking about Comey. \u201cDo I believe [the reopened investigation] was the singular factor in her loss? No. Do I believe it was a factor? Yes, I do,\u201d she says. The first thing she heard after Clinton gave her concession speech on 9 November was reporters shouting, \u201cDo you blame yourself, Huma?\u201d She says she still has no idea why her emails were on her ex-husband\u2019s computer. I ask how she felt when President Trump thanked Comey after winning the election. After a long pause she says: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I have a word you can print.\u201d\nAlmost exactly a year after that, Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Before he was incarcerated, the two of them attempted to file for divorce, but because of the enormous media interest, Abedin reluctantly withdrew the petition. (They are currently finalising details of their divorce.) She had expected to spend that year working as chief of staff to the first female president; instead, she was shuttling her son to prison for visits with his father in a country that was enacting a so-called Muslim ban, and she still laughs at the dystopian absurdity of it. Were she and Hillary bitter after the election?\n\u201cBitterness is not the word, but I was angry. There was also a lot of \u2018I told you so\u2019 [to the public and media]. Like, \u2018I told you this Muslim ban was going to happen!\u2019\u201d\nJordan is now nine and I ask if he has his father\u2019s all-too-recognisable surname; she says he does. How has she explained that photo of him lying in bed next to his father?\n\u201cThat\u2019s a conversation that, when he\u2019s at an age when it\u2019s appropriate, we\u2019re going to have. He knows there are moments when there are [photographers] around and he\u2019s had to deal with the gaggles,\u201d she says. The first thing Jordan asked her when she told him she had written a book was: \u201cDoes that mean those men are coming back?\u201d\nAfter Weiner was released, and registered as a sex offender, he got an apartment in the same building as Abedin, to make things easier for Jordan. This remains the status quo. In 2019, after he told Abedin he was dating again, she did the one thing she had always resisted: she looked through his old phone. It turned out that, after 2013, while they were still married, he hadn\u2019t just been sexting women \u2013 he\u2019d been having sex with them, sometimes in their family home. With a therapist, they then went through a disclosure process, in which he told her everything. Knowing the truth at last helped her to shake off the anger, the shame and the resentment, and to move on. These days she says they are \u201cmore than civil to each other\u201d but when I ask what he\u2019s doing now for a job, her voice hardens: \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him. I assume he\u2019s doing stuff.\u201d (According to a New Yorker interview in December 2020, he\u2019s running a company that makes \u201ccountertops out of concrete and crushed Heineken bottles\u201d.) Abedin, meanwhile, is still working for Hillary. \u201cShe\u2019s doing a show for Apple TV, she and her daughter have set up a production company, and there\u2019s all these amazing projects,\u201d she says brightly. It was always about the cause. I ask her if she\u2019s seeing anyone and she goes all fluttery: \u201cOh my goodness. This is a question I was not prepared for. No, I\u2019m not seeing anyone. I don\u2019t really go on dates. That\u2019s kind of sad, now that I think of it. But if you have any leads, I\u2019ll take them.\u201d\nWhat is she looking for in a partner?\nShe thinks for a moment: \u201cSomebody not in politics, don\u2019t you think?\u201d",

        "content": "Thomas Vilsack says US does not \u2018have to reduce the amount of meat or livestock produced\u2019 to tackle climate crisis\nAmericans can carry on eating meat while keeping the world within safe limits on global heating, the US secretary of agriculture has insisted.\nThomas Vilsack said: \u201cI do not think we have to reduce the amount of meat or livestock produced in the US. And a significant percentage is exported. It\u2019s not a question of eating more or less or producing more or less. The question is making production more sustainable.\u201d\nHe told the Guardian in an interview at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow that livestock production could be made more efficient, and the amount of methane produced by farm animals reduced, which along with other measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be enough to reduce carbon from farming.\nRuminants such as cattle and sheep produce methane, as does animal manure. The potent greenhouse gas has a heating effect about 80 times greater than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though it breaks down sooner. Meat accounts for about 60% of greenhouse gas production from agriculture, which itself is one of the highest carbon-producing sectors globally.\nThe US, the EU and scores of other countries signed a deal at Cop26 to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030, though none of the countries have taken on a firm national reduction goal under the deal. If the target is reached, global heating could be reduced by about 0.2C.\nVilsack said: \u201cIf you reduce methane by livestock by 30%, by food additives or different feed, or you capture the methane to biogas \u2013 take the manure and use it as biofuel \u2013 then you have made livestock production more sustainable. I do not think you need to reduce meat consumption to get that.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf we are going to feed 9 billion people, you need meat protein. We will need plant, animal and fish protein.\u201d\nHe said the US was financing demonstration projects for new technology and farming methods that would reduce methane.\nGreen campaigners have focused on meat eating as a key source of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, but particularly in the US where a meat-heavy diet has become the norm over decades. People in the US eat close to 100kg of meat a year, more than any other country, although there has been a trend towards healthier eating among younger people in recent years.\nMeat-eating is also a driver of deforestation around the world, as rainforest in countries such as Brazil is cleared for cattle ranches and to produce animal feed.\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time politicians stopped giving cover to the industrial meat industry. At the moment they get a free ride and we pay the price for their huge health and environmental impacts.\u201d\nVilsack said greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture could be substantially reduced by new technology and employing different methods, but that it was also vital to look at how agriculture must adapt to become more resilient against the impact of a changing climate.\n\u201cThe climate crisis threatens to disrupt food systems around the globe, exacerbate food insecurity and negatively impact farmers\u2019 livelihoods. We must invest in innovative, science-based solutions to help agriculture mitigate and adapt to climate change,\u201d he said.\nTo that end, the US is one of the main investors, alongside the United Arab Emirates, in the $4bn Agriculture Innovation Mission. Backed by more than 30 countries and more than 40 civil society groups, the project will encompass new technology, including artificial intelligence programmes and research, to adapting growing techniques in the field, gathering data on weather impacts, ways to nurture soils better, and a \u201cgreener cattle initiative\u201d to change the diets of cows to produce less methane.",

        "content": "The Green Bay star once vied for the status of the NFL\u2019s most well-liked player. After Friday\u2019s bizarre interview about his vaccine status, it\u2019s safe to assume those days are behind him\nTo think, Aaron Rodgers could be hosting Jeopardy! right now. Yes, the Green Bay Packers quarterback was at one point one of the leading candidates to host the iconic quiz show. He got rave reviews during his tenure as a guest host, even, becoming a sort of pop-intellectual figure in American life. Well, after Rodgers\u2019 public-relations disaster of an interview on the Pat McAfee Show on Friday, they can consider themselves fortunate that they dodged at least one bullet on their star-crossed quest to replace the late Alex Trebek.\nRodgers \u2013 who is currently unavailable to play with his team after testing positive for Covid-19 \u2013 went on the SiriusXM program after reports emerged revealing he was, at best, fudging the truth when he previously claimed he was \u201cimmunized\u201d rather than fully vaccinated. The good news was that this time around, he was more direct. The bad news, was that he was probably way too honest for his own good.\nIt could have been much easier for all involved. When given a chance to defend himself for not being vaccinated, Rodgers claimed he had \u201can allergy to an ingredient that\u2019s in the mRNA vaccines\u201d. Had he stuck with this line of defense, he could have deflected some of the criticism that was to come. Sure, after the \u201cimmunized\u201d debacle, Rodgers would not have gotten the benefit of the doubt that he would have been given a week earlier, but it would have been far more prudent than the path he did take directly off the rails.\nInstead, Rodgers\u2019 interview featured an avalanche of anti-vaxxer buzzwords and all-too-familiar phrases, each one laying bare the hollowness of his disclaimer that he was not \u201canti-vax\u201d. You\u2019ll never guess it, but Rodgers did his own research with the aid of none other than conspiracy theory-minded podcaster Joe Rogan. He confirmed that his personal \u201cimmunization protocol\u201d included ivermectin and then proceeded to rail against (yawn) \u201cthe woke mob\u201d and \u201ccancel culture\u201d. He even threw in a Martin Luther King Jr misquote, as if he were trying to pull off the Full Tucker Carlson.\nThe interview, which inspired nonstop ridicule on social media, threatens to irrevocably hurt the reputation of someone who \u2013 just months ago \u2013 was one of the most beloved athletes in the country. Since replacing Brett Favre as Green Bay\u2019s starter in 2008, Rodgers quickly became one of the NFL\u2019s most bankable stars. He established himself as one of the most exciting and talented quarterbacks in the game and his charming off-the-field persona had, until recently, translated into a broad appeal that few other athletes could claim.\nHow broad? A 2020 survey revealed that just 8% of respondents had a negative opinion of Rodgers. That\u2019s quite impressive considering how little fun it is for non-Packers fans to watch the league\u2019s reigning Most Valuable Player dismantle their team\u2019s defenses on a regular basis. He even helped break down the stereotype that athletes couldn\u2019t also be intellectually curious, a fact which ironically could be his undoing if it led him to take his current stance on Covid-19.\nHis reputation will not survive this unscathed. As ESPN\u2019s Mina Kimes points out, Rodgers\u2019 irresponsible comments aren\u2019t just harmless nonsense. Having already put others in danger with his decision, he added to the harm by going on record by spreading misinformation couched in the all-too-familiar language of the nation\u2019s massive anti-vaccination movement. \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d breaks down when we\u2019re talking about infectious diseases.\nThat point is key here. Rodgers isn\u2019t the only NFL quarterback who has publicly pushed treatments of dubious medical value. One of the reasons that Tom Brady now plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is that the New England Patriots didn\u2019t approve of his closeness to controversial \u201cnutrition advisor\u201d Alex Guerrero. Meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 Russell Wilson has been selling his fellow athletes on a type of water that supposedly helps treat concussions (there is no credible medical evidence that it does so).\nWhile both Brady and Wilson received some negative media attention for propping up what we will charitably call \u201cunproven remedies\u201d, they were smart enough to not escalate the bad press as Rodgers has. Also, to state something that should be obvious but clearly isn\u2019t, there\u2019s a difference in magnitude between making wild, untested claims about the benefits of drinking water and spreading proven disinformation during a pandemic.\nRodgers isn\u2019t heading towards a full-blown \u201ccancellation\u201d, however much as he seems to be itching for one. Conservative football fans \u2013 a significant portion of the NFL audience \u2013 will embrace him as one of their own. He\u2019s already setting himself up for a profitable future in right-wing punditry circles. As his friend Rogan knows, there\u2019s a lot of money to be made in calling out the so-called \u201cwoke mobs\u201d.\nThere will almost certainly be consequences, however. Rodgers might lose a few sponsorships and the NFL \u2013 probably more irritated at being criticized than the fact that Rodgers misled the public about his vaccination status \u2013 has already launched a media counterattack. The Packers also can\u2019t be happy with any of this, but since Rodgers has already made it clear that he wants out of the organization that might be a feature rather than a bug.\nRodgers\u2019 pocketbook might take something of a hit, but as long as he\u2019s one of the top quarterbacks in the league, he will be fine financially. Where the real damage will come will be in his public standing. Rodgers will never compete for the title of most-liked player in the league again and he has nobody but himself to blame. Not all defeats in the NFL happen on the field.",

It grows in thick mottled patterns up the wall and around the windows, clinging to baseboards, the curtains, furniture and clothing.\nBut Leon and her family have struggled to leave their house in Fresno, California, even though she and her two children have developed asthma. There\u2019s simply nowhere else they can afford.\nFresno is the largest city in the agricultural Central Valley, and has historically been one of the most affordable places to live in California. But during the pandemic, rents began to rise dramatically, climbing by 26% over 12 months.\nLocals attribute the surge to people seeking to escape the high cost of living in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. But even as life returns to pre-pandemic norms, those who live here say the situation isn\u2019t getting any better. Rents, which had been steadily climbing for years before the pandemic, are still rising and, coupled with a shortage of homes, that\u2019s hitting low-income residents hardest.\n\u201cDuring Covid, Fresno and Central Valley rents just kept increasing,\u201d said Jovana Morales-Tilgren, a housing policy coordinator with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability. \u201cMany people were struggling and are still struggling. Landlords keep raising rents and people have nowhere to go.\u201d\nWith a median cost of $1,141 for a one-bedroom and $1,421 for a two-bedroom, Fresno rents are still below those of San Francisco or Los Angeles. But Fresno is among the most diverse cities in the US, and also one of the poorest. About 50% of households make less than $50,000 a year, while a quarter of residents are in poverty, according to US Census data.\nFifty per cent of Fresno\u2019s population is Latino, and several residents told the Guardian they immigrated here decades ago from Mexico because of Fresno\u2019s job opportunities and affordability \u2013 a reality that is quickly disappearing.\n\u201cIn places like Fresno you have really high rates of poverty and a significant share of people who have really low incomes,\u201d said Carolina Reid, a faculty research adviser with the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation. \u201cThe labor market in Fresno is not catching up to the price of housing.\u201d\nThe situation has left families with few options, forcing them to stay in substandard housing, move in with other family members or even leave Fresno entirely, Morales-Tilgren said.\nThe Leons have been looking for a new place to live for months. They currently pay $650 a month, but their landlord is planning to raise the rent by at least 45% to cover the cost of renovations to the building, meaning they could soon be paying $1,000 a month.\nLeon\u2019s son, who works in fruit label manufacturing, is the primary breadwinner in the house, and there are few options the family can afford. The Leons have applied for at least eight apartments, paying fees of $30 each time, but in Fresno\u2019s competitive rental market they have never heard back.\n\u201cI have nowhere else to go,\u201d Leon, 53, said in Spanish. \u201cSince May I\u2019ve been looking but I haven\u2019t found anything.\u201d\nAshley Miranda, a mother of two who works at Starbucks, has spent six months trying to find a new place that\u2019s safer and quieter for her children. It used to be easy to find two-bedrooms for around $900 a month, Miranda said, but now those same apartments go for $1,500.\n\u201cMy fingers are crossed,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want something better. I have two kids and I want their environment to be better. I just don\u2019t understand why everything has gotten so expensive.\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t enough data to determine how large a role migration from other parts of the state has played in Fresno\u2019s housing prices, but it is believed to be significant. Fresno was the only one of California\u2019s five largest cities to see a population gain last year, which could indicate an influx from more expensive parts of the state.\n\u201cFresno is becoming a very popular place,\u201d said Karla Martinez, a policy advocate with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability who works with Fresno residents. \u201cPeople see how cheap the housing market is here.\u201d California\u2019s high-speed rail project, which will connect Los Angeles to San Francisco via the Central Valley, is also a selling point, Martinez said.\nThe city has traditionally had the most affordable housing in the state, said H Spees, Fresno\u2019s housing and homeless initiatives director, but California\u2019s population growth and lack of affordability has hit the area hard.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got folks from coastal areas that are finding it a very positive move to sell their one-story, 1,400 sq ft ranch house for $1m in San Jose and move to Fresno and buy a wonderfully large home for $400,000. That\u2019s been fueled even more by working remotely through Covid but it was already beginning to happen.\u201d\nThat reality has left some longtime residents thinking about leaving entirely; residents such as Isabel Vargas, a 59-year-old who has lived in Fresno for 32 years. Vargas has spent more than half that time in the same three-bedroom rental, where she pays $550 a month. But a new landlord who recently bought the house has said she and her family must leave.\nSearching for a new home has now become her daughter\u2019s full-time job, but Vargas says if they can\u2019t find anything in their price range, they will probably leave the city. It\u2019s something Morales-Tilgren and Martinez say they are hearing from others, too.\nThose who find housing within Fresno sometimes end up in units that are all but uninhabitable, Morales-Tilgren adds. \u201cYou\u2019ll have folks that have rodent infestations, broken fixtures, mold, a lot of these extremely unhealthy environments because that\u2019s all they can afford.\u201d\nFrancisca Alba lives in a tidy two-bedroom apartment with her husband and four children. They can afford the monthly rent of $710, but the unit has been deteriorating for years and the property manager has done little to help. The carpet hasn\u2019t been replaced, or even cleaned, in the 15 years she\u2019s lived there, nor has the unit received a fresh coat of paint.\nThe floors are damaged from recent flooding and there\u2019s been a hole in the wall for more than a year since workers fixed pipes near the sink. The property manager told her no one can make the repair due to Covid, so she\u2019s carefully covered it with a poster board and tacks.\n\u201cIt lowers my self-esteem to see these things. Overall, it brings me sadness,\u201d she said through a translator. \u201cThe managers think that we aren\u2019t going to do anything about it, maybe because we\u2019re low-income \u2013 so why would they do anything to fix it?\u201d\nFresno county is short more than 36,000 affordable housing units, according to the California Housing Partnership, a trend echoed throughout the state. It\u2019s a crisis driven by a demand that far exceeds the supply and a lack of subsidies to build affordable housing.\n\u201cOverall California\u2019s housing market is broken,\u201d Reid said.\nAt the same time, the city is grappling with a 69% rise in homelessness between 2019-2020 after years of working to reduce it. Fresno has extended a local eviction moratorium through the end of the year, offered emergency rental housing assistance and expanded housing options for homeless residents, but Spees says the problem \u201cis not something that\u2019s going to go away soon\u201d.\nMartinez and advocates with the Leadership Counsel for Justice hope to see the city council pass rent control, stronger protections against eviction and right to counsel, which they say are necessary to address the crisis.\nWithout such changes and more affordable housing, experts warn the outcome will be grim. \u201cThen Fresno is going to experience a lot of the same issues we\u2019re seeing in the Bay Area: rising housing insecurity, potentially displacement and homelessness,\u201d Reid said.\nMartha Leon says everyone she knows has been affected by rent increases. Friends are facing rent hikes every six months \u2013 her brother\u2019s rent has gone up more than 50% \u2013 and loved ones are leaving. But she doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019ll go next.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere. It\u2019s here or Mexico.\u201d",

        "content": "These two teams are often presented as rugby\u2019s bridesmaids but the ingredients are in place for an intriguing contest\nThe schedulers have saved the weekend\u2019s most intriguing contest for Sunday. All too often in recent years Scotland and Australia have presented as rugby\u2019s equivalent of bridesmaids, but the Wallabies turn up to Murrayfield on a five-match winning streak, including a swaggering double over South Africa, the world champions. And Scotland will field seven British & Irish Lions, which, by the standards of the rest of this century, must feel more than they know what to do with.\nGregor Townsend, a returning Lions coach (alongside another in Steve Tandy), welcomes back his captain, Stuart Hogg, who is joined by other headliners in Finn Russell, Duhan van der Merwe and Chris Harris. Ali Price, Hamish Watson and Zander Fagerson were already in situ for the 60-14 win over Tonga last Saturday. If Rory Sutherland had been fit, there might have been eight.\nAll of which should mean that the confidence developed by Scotland, which has grown in agonising fits and starts over what might be termed the Hogg-Russell era, is riding as high as ever. When a team are able to demote a player who scored four tries the week before, an air of confidence does naturally thicken. Kyle Steyn was player of the match against Tonga but must now make do with a place on the bench.\nHe was far from the only star. His mate on the other wing, Rufus McLean, became the first player born this century to win a Scotland cap and marked the occasion with two dazzling tries in the first few minutes.\nHow much we should read into the win over Tonga will remain a moot point for now. Scotland have made six changes for Australia, with those four returning Lions joining a fresh lock pairing of Sam Skinner and Grant Gilchrist.\nBut Tonga were suffering from familiar availability problems, their best players \u2013 even more of them than Scotland\u2019s \u2013 not released by their various clubs for an international outside the designated window.\nIf only those problems were confined to last week. Australia have suffered a curious set of withdrawals of their own, even though the relevant window is now officially open. Quade Cooper, Samu Kerevi and Sean McMahon have chosen to remain with their generous employers in Japan. The thinking behind their decision not to tour remains opaque, with Cooper and Kerevi declaring their love for the Wallabies without quite explaining whether this was their decision, their clubs\u2019 or possibly even Australia\u2019s.\nThe latter is the least likely explanation. Cooper and Kerevi have been instrumental in the renaissance over the past couple of months since their customary dismantling at the hands of the All Blacks. Their two subsequent victories over the Springboks were the latest to explode the cliche that the only way to prevail over South Africa is to beat them at their own game. The Lions notably failed to do that this year, but the Wallabies moved them around, All Blacks-style, with much success.\nScotland\u00a0Hogg (capt); Graham, Harris, Johnson, Van der Merwe; Russell, Price; Schoeman, Turner, Z Fagerson, Skinner, Gilchrist, Ritchie, Watson, M Fagerson\u00a0Replacements\u00a0Ashman, Bhatti, Kebble, Hodgson, Bayliss, G Horne, Hastings, Steyn\nAustralia Kellaway; Wright, Ikitau, Paisami, Petaia; O\u2019Connor, White; Slipper, Fainga\u2019a, Alaalatoa, R Arnold, Rodda, Leota, Hooper (capt), Valetini Replacements McInerney, Bell, Tupous, Skelton, Samu, McDermott, Beale, Perese\nReferee Romain Poite (Fr)\nHow delicious, then, that Australia, with or without the Japan Three, descend upon Edinburgh to take on the team of the Lions attack coach. We can safely say Townsend will have Scotland playing rather more ambitious rugby than the Lions managed. Bridesmaids Scotland and Australia might often be, but they regularly prove more pleasing on the eye than some of those accustomed to the garlands.\nAustralia, who are tying themselves in terrible knots over the latest tweaks to their eligibility criteria for overseas players, are rolling out some more exiles familiar from yesteryear. Rory Arnold, of Toulouse, with rather less than the stipulated 60 caps for an overseas player, will start in the second row, which should equip Australia well, should something less pretty be required. As might Will Skelton, lately of Saracens, now La Rochelle, who lurks on the bench alongside another exile, Kurtley Beale, whose 92 caps at least qualify him under the infamous terms of Giteau\u2019s law.\nOne suspects Australia will follow South Africa\u2019s lead by giving up on all pretence at encouraging their players to stay at home. Scotland, interestingly, have never bothered with such rules. They may not enjoy the advantages in preparation of the Englands and Irelands of this world, but there is a settled look to their first team and it is high on quality.\nDave Rennie, Australia\u2019s coach, knows this well. His previous job was a successful three years in charge of Glasgow, taking over from Townsend. Just another little ingredient to spice up Sunday\u2019s fare. The weekend\u2019s rugby is far from over.",

        "content": "Up to 100,000, including Kahnawake Mohawk delegates, brave Glasgow rain as 22 arrested after scientists blockade bridge\nPeople on almost every continent were gathering for marches and rallies on Saturday to mark a Global Day for Climate Justice, halfway through the Glasgow climate change summit.\nActivists in the Philippines, eight hours ahead of the UK, had already finished their rally as protesters gathered in Scotland. There were also rallies in South Korea, Indonesia, the Netherlands and France. The Belgian arm of Extinction Rebellion occupied a street in Brussels.\nThe Scottish morning saw heavy rain, but the early mood was one of cheerful acceptance. \u201cWhat do you expect protesting in Glasgow?\u201d asked Lucy Bell, who works for the Vegan Kind, an online vegan supermarket based in Rutherglen. \u201cThere are so many people here from different backgrounds. It\u2019s easy to get discouraged by the negotiations going on behind closed doors but I\u2019m feeling optimistic this morning despite the rain.\u201d\nIn Glasgow city centre, direct action group Scientist Rebellion blocked the King George V bridge, one of the main routes to the south side, at about 11.30am. More than 20 scientists, from students to a retired professor, all wearing lab coats stood chained together by the neck. The coalition of activist academics believes non-violent civil disobedience is the only remaining option to draw attention to the extremity of the climate crisis.\nWas it this guy? \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/h98FEyBc5g\n\u201cThere have been 25 previous Cops with no measurable impact on GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions,\u201d said Tim Hewlett, co-founder and one of those on the bridge. \u201cIn fact, about half of the GHG emissions have been released since COP1 in 1995. So we\u2019re not here to speak truth to power \u2013 they already know \u2013 but to the powerless, and to raise their voices in turn.\u201d Hewlett added that the lab coats they were wearing were at least offering some protection from the rain. The bridge was blocked until just before 4pm, and the group said that 21 people had been arrested.\nLater on Saturday, Gary Ritchie, Police Scotland assistant chief constable, said: \u201cGlasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us \u2026 can ever remember.\u201d\nThe day had \u201cpassed largely without incident\u201d, he said, but \u201ca group of people was contained by officers after their conduct deteriorated, pyrotechnic devices were used and they brought the procession to a halt\u201d. One person was arrested after the march. This is in addition to the 21 arrests already noted on the bridge.\nThe march got under way at about midday, and was headed by a small group of First Nation people from Kahnawake Mohawk territory located in Quebec, Canada.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so evident that indigenous people hold the answers \u2013 they have to start listening and start thinking seven generations ahead, not just the immediate need,\u201d said Karahkwintha, 23.\nOhontsakahte, 26, added: \u201cInside the Cop venue, unfortunately, it\u2019s corporate interests at the front of the line, so here today indigenous people are leading the movement \u2013 and that\u2019s how it should be inside the Cop venue too. We\u2019re here to put indigenous voices at the forefront of the climate crisis.\u201d\nCop delegates were also scattered among the huge crowds. Tracy Sonny, 37, a Cop negotiator from Botswana focused on climate adaptation and capacity building, was at the march to show solidarity and call for more unity. \u201cWe need to see more political will and a change in mindset \u2026 we\u2019re already feeling the impact of climate change; we need to respond now, people are drowning.\u201d\nDespite the dreich weather, the atmosphere was electric as each bloc made itself heard with live music and chants such as \u201csystem change not climate change\u201d and \u201cworld leaders at Cop26 \u2026 your inaction makes us sick.\u201d\nGrainne McGinn, 22, a wheelchair user from Glasgow, attended Friday\u2019s youth protest and Saturday\u2019s with a sign that read \u201csustainability requires accessibility\u201d. \u201cClimate change is so important but youth voices, especially disabled youth voices, are not being heard. We\u2019ve seen in the news how inaccessible Cop has been for delegates. That\u2019s the day-to-day experience for all disabled people and it\u2019s so important that our voices are heard in the conversation on climate change. I\u2019m here to represent.\u201d\nVegan activists fought strong gales to make their point with four giant inflatable animals tethered on ropes above their heads or strapped to the ground. Each symbolised a different problem with the livestock industry: a cow for methane, a chicken for Covid and health, a fish for microplastics, and a pig for obesity. \u201cThe cow in the room is being ignored at this Cop,\u201d said Carl Le Blanc of Climate Healers. \u201cAnimal agriculture has been taken off the agenda and put on the menu.\u201d\nRoisin Greaney, 28, a postgrad student from Dublin said: \u201cI\u2019m here today because, I would say a small group of people but in this case it\u2019s a very large group of people, wants to put a sustained pressure on the people inside the blue zone.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in the past, I\u2019ve seen small groups of people come together and scare governments, scare companies, and make them do things. So I think this kind of direct action works, and it\u2019s amazing to see people from so many different organisations and parts of society.\u201d\nThere was also despair; Chris Cornroy, 37, who works for Oxfam, said: \u201cThe world is probably going to end within our lifetime, so any difference you can make counts. But I don\u2019t think anything will be achieved from this if I\u2019m being honest. I don\u2019t think anything will make a positive difference today.\u201d\nBy the afternoon the rain clouds had parted and the sky had begun to brighten as crowds of marchers spilled across the expanse of Glasgow Green, still singing, chanting and playing music.\nThe mood was \u201ccelebratory, positive and punchy\u201d said Mary Martin from Coatbridge, who had marched from Kelvingrove. \u201cWalking the walk,\u201d she laughed as she shivered against a strong gust of wind. As for the progress of the climate talks, \u201cI\u2019m holding my breath.\u201d The lack of inclusivity at the negotiations concerns her, the opposite of her experience on this march where she notes the rapport between different groups.\nIn London thousands of protesters, including trade unionists, refugee rights groups, students and environmentalists, marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square.\nDemonstrators repeatedly expressed exasperation that politicians were failing to tackle the climate emergency with the required urgency. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time,\u201d said Paula Somrisa, 41, from Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s great to make statements about ambitions and what is going to happen in the future but we really need action now.\u201d\nDawn Fuller, 56, said: \u201cWe have had enough of hearing them talk \u2013 now we absolutely have to see some real action.\u201d She said her two grown-up children were increasingly anxious about the escalating climate emergency. \u201cWe have seen so much greenwashing at Cop26 \u2026 But it has to stop \u2013 it is our children\u2019s future at stake.\u201d\nMany protesters called for urgent reform of the economic system and linked the climate crisis to global inequality and structural racism.\nRebecca Hotchkin, 23, who is studying medicine in London, said global health inequalities were being exacerbated by the climate crisis. \u201cHealth justice and climate justice are linked. Governments must start addressing the underlying causes to the various crises we face.\u201d\nIn Glasgow organisers estimated that more than 100,000 people were in attendance, but police were reluctant to put a figure on the crowd. In London they said about 10,000 were marchers, although organisers put the figure closer to 20,000. Worldwide there were more than 300 protests, with more than 100 in the UK alone.\nNicola Sturgeon told reporters on Friday that she had confidence that the Glasgow climate march would be policed \u201cappropriately\u201d, adding that Iain Livingstone, Police Scotland\u2019s chief constable, had spoken to the force\u2019s independent advisory group after the concerns were raised in an open letter.",

It also had the effect of trashing the reputation of parliament.\u201d\nMPs had been due on Wednesday to vote on the Tory MP\u2019s 30-day Commons suspension for advocating on behalf of two companies, which paid him more than \u00a3100,000 a year between them.\nBut Downing Street instead backed an amendment suspending the punishment and creating a new standards body with a built-in Tory majority. The following day, after intense criticism, the government performed a U-turn \u2013 turning its back on the amendment after it had passed through the House of Commons. Paterson, a former Northern Ireland and environment secretary, announced his resignation shortly afterwards.\nMajor called this attempt to protect Paterson \u201cprofoundly un-Conservative\u201d and something he disliked \u201cintensely\u201d. He also said the action of the current administration was \u201cdamaging at home and to our reputation overseas\u201d.\nThe former PM said what happened this week wasn\u2019t the only time Johnson\u2019s government had behaved in an \u201cun-Conservative\u201d way \u2013 and that he had been concerned for some time.\nOne example he gave was how announcements are often leaked to sections of the press before MPs are informed; another was the handling of Brexit \u2013 particularly the decision to override elements of the Brexit deal.\nHe said: \u201cThere is a general whiff of \u2018We are the masters now\u2019 about their behaviour.\u201d\nAn enraged Major added: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the government, with their over-large majority, do tend to treat parliament with contempt. And if that continues, it will end badly.\n\u201cThey bypass parliament at will and the speaker has expressed his frustration about that on many occasions, and rightly so. But they also behaved badly in other ways that are perhaps politically corrupt.\u201d\nMajor is no stranger to sleaze, given the scandals that engulfed his own government back in the 1990s, such as cash for questions.\n\u201c[The sleaze] was immensely damaged or damaging and it was embarrassing. It hurt the government. It hurt parliament. It involved a relatively small number of people who misbehaved, the worst of which was \u2018cash for questions\u2019. There was no excuse for that.\u201d\nBut he said the crucial difference is the way he handled it.\n\u201cWhen that happened I set up the Nolan committee on standards in public life to stop it, which has been a huge success. The striking difference is this: in the 1990s I set up a committee to tackle this sort of behaviour.\n\u201cOver the last few days we have seen today\u2019s government trying to defend this sort of behaviour. Sleaze is unacceptable, was unacceptable when I was there, and I suffered a great deal of pain and anguish over it \u2026 It needs to be stopped.\u201d",

However, the financial settlements were based on four test cases concluded in the high court in 2017. The four were awarded a total of \u00a384,000 based on three separate incidents.\nAt the time, one claimant was awarded \u00a333,000 by Mr Justice Leggatt for unlawful detention and a beating it was determined he had suffered in 2007, by \u201cone or more implements\u201d, probably rifle butts.\nTwo Iraqi merchant seamen received payments after their detention in 2003: one was awarded \u00a328,000 after an assault and hooding, while a second was awarded \u00a310,000 because they had also been hooded.\nMany of the fresh claims also involve hooding \u2013 where a sandbag or other hood is thrown over the head of a detainee. The practice was banned in 1972 by Ted Heath, when he was prime minister, although some British soldiers have admitted they were not aware of the order while serving in Iraq.\nThe MoD has not made any public announcement about the claims, but an official disclosure out this week showed that the civil actions had been resolved. It noted that 417 \u201cIraq private law\u201d claims had been settled during 2020-21 and a further 13 relating to Afghanistan.\nHowever, there is no prospect of any criminal action following the 417 civil settlements, after several years of often politically charged debate about the conduct of British soldiers in Iraq during the years of combat operations, which ended in 2011.\nThe government closed down the Iraq historic allegations team in 2017, following the conclusion of the controversial al-Sweady inquiry three years earlier.\nThat inquiry found that allegations of British troops murdering detained Iraqis and mutilating their bodies were fabricated. The lead lawyer who had brought those claims, Phil Shiner, was subsequently struck off.\nIn April, the government passed the Overseas Operations Act, which introduced a presumption against criminal prosecutions for five years after the event and a longstop to prevent civil claims being brought after six years.\nAt one point, Day and two colleagues were also accused of professional misconduct for the way in which they had brought claims, but the three lawyers were exonerated following a hearing at the solicitor\u2019s disciplinary tribunal.\nAn MoD spokesperson said: \u201cWhilst the vast majority of UK personnel conducted themselves to the highest standards in Iraq and Afghanistan, we acknowledge that it has been necessary to seek negotiated settlements of outstanding claims in both the Iraq civilian litigation and Afghan civil litigation.\u201d\nThey added that service police and the Service Prosecuting Authority remained open to considering criminal allegations should new evidence emerge.",

        "content": "Arsenal\u2019s summer signing meets his mentor at Watford on Sunday, having quashed doubts over his \u00a324m price tag\nPerhaps the doubters should have listened to the Premier League\u2019s most experienced first-choice goalkeeper. Three weeks after Arsenal had signed Aaron Ramsdale for an initial \u00a324m that, whatever hindsight might suggest, made many eyes water they were offered an alternative viewpoint by Ben Foster. \u201cThe guy seriously impresses me every time he plays,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a little bit of that mentality where he doesn\u2019t care. Nothing fazes him and nothing bothers him: he\u2019s going to go on to be a serious monster in goal.\u201d\nFoster will hope Ramsdale has an increasingly rare off day when his Watford side visit the Emirates on Sunday but, whoever finishes on top, the mutual respect will be genuine. Ramsdale is a West Brom fan and, through his teens, was present to see Foster keep goal at the Hawthorns. He has spoken reverentially of the 38-year-old in the past and considered it a career milestone when, two years ago, the pair faced one another during his time at Bournemouth.\n\u201cI watched him for a long, long time,\u201d he said after both keepers had achieved a clean sheet. \u201cThe way he plays, the speed he plays at and being able to kick off both feet, I know his game inside and out. There are definitely things you try to take out of his game and implement into mine.\u201d\nRamsdale\u2019s attention to detail is little surprise. One of the attributes that has delighted colleagues at Arsenal\u2019s training ground since his arrival is his absorption in the sport: Ramsdale verges on the hyper-observant, watching games religiously and paying attention to minor points of a player\u2019s routine, down to the off-field commitments expected on a match day, where other professionals might not. It is an attitude that has, in seven league appearances, transmitted on to the pitch: at a middling 6ft 2in he might not fill the goal with his stature but a vibrant personality lifts those around him and presents opponents with a fresh obstacle.\nThat was among the assets that seduced Mikel Arteta. One of the laziest barbs aimed at Ramsdale was that, in his two Premier League seasons, he had been relegated twice, with Bournemouth and Sheffield United. He missed only one game in those campaigns and perhaps it says something that, when Eddie Howe, Chris Wilder and Paul Heckingbottom tinkered in search of a formula for escaping the drop, the goalkeeping position remained unchanged. Maybe they saw what Arteta did: a preternatural ability to roll with the punches.\n\u201cI watched a lot of clips and moments after he conceded a goal, making a mistake or a difficult moment,\u201d Arteta said on Friday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the big reasons we made a decision to sign him, because he could cope with those.\u201d\nThe logic was sound, if rarely heard. It can be taken as read that goalkeepers in the top two divisions are outstanding shot stoppers. The step up from competent to elite is made between the ears and Ramsdale\u2019s imperviousness to disappointment, a condition that has afflicted Arsenal for too long, struck a chord.\n\u201cHe\u2019s made some really big saves for us lately,\u201d Heckingbottom said in May when the Blades\u2019 fate had long been sealed. \u201cBut perhaps even more so than that, it\u2019s been the belief and single-mindedness he has shown to keep on going and show people what he\u2019s made of. Because it would have been easier for him just to fold. He didn\u2019t. And that takes something a little bit special in my book.\u201d\nIn a revamped Arsenal defence that has shipped only four goals since he usurped Bernd Leno, Ramsdale is yet to encounter the negative scrutiny that accompanies regular concessions. The day will arrive when he makes a critical mistake but he has quickly amassed enough credit to fend off brickbats. Interaction with the fanbase has been a theme in his early months, from joining in with Leicester supporters\u2019 barracking at goal-kicks last week to his increasingly familiar pumping-up of the Emirates crowd.\nRamsdale operates with his heart on his sleeve: there is something of the amateur player, and not in the pejorative sense, in such an uninhibited approach. Figures at Arsenal liken him to an old-school football character: ready with wit and a wisecrack, but businesslike when required. Jack Wilshere, whose influence as a non-contract training participant at London Colney has also been well received, is cut from a similar cloth.\n\u201cConnection brings unity and a different kind of vibration between fans and players,\u201d said Arteta of Ramsdale\u2019s ability to lift spirits. \u201cAaron is capable of transmitting that in a natural way. His competitiveness as well, on the pitch, brings the crowd to a different level, because of his desire to win.\u201d\nNone of it would matter without technical accomplishment, but Ramsdale has excelled so far. Only \u00c9douard Mendy has a higher save percentage in the Premier League in 2021-22; it is arguable that his performance at Leicester, jointly with the Chelsea goalkeeper\u2019s display at Brentford, was the goalkeeping highlight of the season to date.\nDistribution skills were a widely trailed reason for Arsenal\u2019s decision to make their move and Ramsdale has broadened their range from the back: only Foster and his counterparts at Newcastle, Burnley and Everton have made a higher percentage of long passes.\nArsenal will expect to bring up three straight wins against Watford, whose early form under Claudio Ranieri has been unpredictable. Foster, who should make his 371st Premier League appearance, is the Hornets\u2019 model of consistency. \u201cIt was great to share the pitch with him,\u201d Ramsdale said in the wake of that meeting in 2019. Master and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would both agree they belong on the same stage.",

        "content": "A growing number of brands are switching to recycled fibers but experts worry people may believe their purchases are impact-free \u2013 when that\u2019s far from true\nWoven into your clothes is a material that takes on many disguises. It may have the texture of wool, the lightness of linen or the sleekness of silk. It\u2019s in two-thirds of our clothing \u2013 and yet most of us don\u2019t even know that it\u2019s there. It\u2019s plastic, and it\u2019s a big problem.\nToday, about 69% of clothes are made up of synthetic fibres, including elastane, nylon and acrylic. Polyester is the most common, making up 52% of all fiber production. Plastic\u2019s unique durability and versatility have made it indispensable to the fashion industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the waistband of your jeans, your shoes, in practically everything you wear, because plastic is this miracle material,\u201d said George Harding-Rolls, campaigns adviser at the Changing Markets Foundation, an organization that investigates corporate practices.\nBut there\u2019s a climate cost: the raw material for these fibers is fossil fuels. Textile production consumes 1.35% of global oil production, more oil than Spain uses in a year, and significantly contributes to the fashion industry\u2019s huge climate footprint. Synthetics also continue to have an impact long after production, shedding plastic microfibers into the environment when clothes are washed.\nIn response, a growing number of brands are switching to recycled versions of synthetic fibers like polyester, often advertising these clothes as the \u201cmore sustainable\u201d or \u201cconscious\u201d choice.\nThis seems like an environmental win. But as brands weave more of these recycled yarns into their garments, some experts question whether they are just patching over fashion\u2019s environmental harms. \u201cWe\u2019ve been led to believe that recycled and sustainable are synonymous, when they are anything but,\u201d said Maxine B\u00e9dat, executive director of the New Standard Institute, a non-profit pushing for a sustainable fashion industry.\nThe common recycled substitute for virgin synthetics are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, the most common type of plastic bottles, which are produced in the billions each year. A survey of nearly 50 fashion brands by the Changing Markets Foundation revealed that 85% of them aimed to source recycled polyester from plastic bottles. Estimates show that recycled polyester could reduce emissions by up to 32% compared to virgin polyester.\nThe demand for recycled synthetics from industries including fashion is expected to accelerate. Nike uses \u201csome recycled material\u201d in 60% of its products, said Seana Hannah, Nike\u2019s vice-president of sustainable innovation. Recycled polyester is a primary focus: \u201cNike is the highest industry user of recycled poly and we divert more than 1bn plastic bottles on average a year from landfills,\u201d Hannah said.\nMany big brands are setting targets. H&M, Madewell, J Crew and Gap Inc are among more than 70 brands that have committed to increase the share of recycled polyester to 45% by 2025 as part of a recycled polyester challenge set by the Textile Exchange, a non-profit working to increase uptake of lower-impact fibers across the textile industry.\nSynthetics make up the second-largest share of fibers after cotton for Gap Inc, said Alice Hartley, director of product sustainability and circularity at the company. All four of its brands \u2013 Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta and Gap \u2013 have committed to the 2025 challenge, with Old Navy opting to increase its recycled polyester to 60%.\nThe company says that recycled synthetics are not a magic bullet. \u201cWe really try to stay away from the term \u2018sustainable garment\u2019, because that implies that we\u2019ve reached the destination. We really haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a continuous journey,\u201d Hartley said.\nYet this nuanced message may not be filtering through to consumers, especially as many other brands do describe recycled fabrics as sustainable. Experts worry that people may believe their purchases are impact-free \u2013 when that\u2019s far from true.\n\u201cIf you are recycling synthetics, that doesn\u2019t get rid of the microplastics problem,\u201d said Harding-Rolls. Fibers continue shedding from recycled plastic yarns just as much as from virgin yarns, he said.\nPET bottles are also part of a well-established, closed-loop recycling system, where they can be efficiently recycled at least 10 times. The apparel industry is \u201ctaking from this closed-loop, and moving it into this linear system\u201d because most of those clothes won\u2019t be recycled, said B\u00e9dat. Converting plastic from bottles into clothes may actually accelerate its path to the landfill, especially for low-quality, fast-fashion garments which are often discarded after only a few uses.\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of greenwashing is taking one piece of the puzzle and extrapolating broad benefits from that,\u201d said Ashley Gill, senior director of standards and stakeholder engagement Textile Exchange. \u201cSustainability in the apparel industry is a really complex issue.\u201d\nThere are moves to use recycled textiles as feedstock for new clothes \u2013 less than 1% of clothes are currently recycled into new fibers \u2013 especially as projections from some markets suggest that cross-industry demand for recycled bottles will soon outstrip supply. But most clothes are made from a medley of fibers, and commercial-scale technology doesn\u2019t yet exist to disentangle these. \u201cA whole supply chain needs to be built up to really get to the commercial volumes that we need, to see more recycled fiber-to-fiber textiles,\u201d Hartley said.\nHyping the lower emissions impact of recycled yarns, said B\u00e9dat, distracts from fashion\u2019s larger emissions source: textile mills, which process fibers into yarn to make fabric as well as dyeing and finishing, an energy-guzzling process that accounts for about 76% of a garment\u2019s lifecycle emissions. \u201cBrands are focusing on what magical material they can create, rather than doing the less sexy work of improving energy efficiency in textile mills,\u201d said B\u00e9dat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pooh-pooh progress, but we really do have to start prioritizing where we\u2019re going to be able to move the needle the most.\u201d\nSome innovators think the solution lies in finding viable alternatives to fossil fuel-derived synthetics that have the same performance traits. Materials science company Kintra Fibers has developed bio-based fibers made from corn and wheat designed to compost fully in nature. \u201cThat addresses the microfiber issue, and provides another pathway for textile circularity as well,\u201d said Alissa Baier-Lentz, the company\u2019s co-founder.\nThe fiber can also be returned to its base components through chemical recycling and used as a feedstock for circular yarn production, Baier-Lentz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just on us to get the [recycling] system in place, and work with industry partners to make it happen,\u201d she said. In 2020 Kintra partnered with clothing brand Pangaia to scale up production of the compostable yarn; the company will launch the first clothes made with Kintra fibers in 2022.\nBut no one innovation is going to solve the fashion industry\u2019s complex plastics problem. Some think the real answer is moving the industry away from a model of excessive production and consumption. Brands churn out dozens of clothing collections a year and, in 2014, people bought 60% more clothing than in 2000 but kept it for half as long. Textile Exchange will focus some of its future industry challenges on \u201cslowing down the growth rate\u201d of clothing production, said Gill.\nLegislation will be needed to drive real, systemic change, said Harding-Rolls: \u201c[The apparel industry] is one of the most lightly regulated industries in the world. What we need now are mandatory measures. We see it working in the plastics space, and it\u2019s time for the fashion sector to follow.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a role for us, too, said B\u00e9dat, and that involves people seeing themselves as citizens who can make ethical and political choices. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trained to see ourselves primarily as consumers \u2026 that the way we solve these problems is by buying, which is the antithesis to the real solution.\u201d",

        "content": "These elegant birds have long held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart and imagination. But now they are dying in untold numbers\nTo the British, the swan is not so much a bird as a national treasure \u2013 the avian equivalent of Dame Judi Dench or Sir David Attenborough. Its unique status is a result of its long and complex history living alongside us, a relationship that goes back well over a thousand years.\nAlarm at reports last week that dozens of swans and cygnets have died of bird flu in Shakespeare\u2019s home town of Stratford-upon-Avon \u2013 up to half of the town\u2019s population \u2013 reminded us just how passionate the British public are about the bird.\nSwans are both more vulnerable than many other birds to the disease, and being so large and obvious, when they do have symptoms more likely to get noticed. The town\u2019s former mayor, Cyril Bennis, who has been campaigning on behalf of the local swans for four decades, has described the deaths as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.\nThe swans in Stratford \u2013 and the species we usually see on our park ponds, lakes, rivers and gravel pits \u2013 are mute swans; yet despite this name, they can and do make a wide range of sounds. \u201cMute\u201d was chosen to contrast with the whooper swan which, as its name suggests, makes a loud, honking call when in flight.\nWhat is not so well known is that the mute swan used to be called the \u201ctame swan\u201d. This was partly to distinguish it from the two species of \u201cwild swan\u201d \u2013 the whooper and its smaller cousin, the Bewick\u2019s \u2013 both of which are winter visitors to Britain from Iceland, Scandinavia and Siberia. The description \u201ctame\u201d was applied because, for more than a millennium from the Anglo-Saxon era through to the 19th century, swans were farmed in swanneries. Today, only one of these, at Abbotsbury in Dorset, survives.\nSwans were kept not simply as a source of feathers and meat (the tender cygnets being preferred to the adults\u2019 much tougher, gamier flesh), but also as a status symbol; owning them was in the gift of the monarch, who would bestow on favoured nobles the right to keep swans. Such was the value of these magnificent birds that to kill a swan was classed as treason, and taking even a single egg could result in a year\u2019s imprisonment.\nThe fact that swans were in the gift of the crown led to another myth \u2013 that all Britain\u2019s swans are owned by the Queen. They are not; although the annual swan-upping ceremony on the River Thames, in which the year\u2019s new cygnets are caught and marked, does denote royal ownership of some.\nUnlike most birds, swans are indeed very tame. Sometimes they may approach closer than you would prefer, especially if you are on their territory in the breeding season. And although the belief that a swan can break a man\u2019s arm with a single blow of its wing is another myth, when a large male shuffles towards you with wings outstretched, hissing loudly, it can be pretty scary. As the Queen\u2019s official swan warden, Professor Christopher Perrins, points out, not everybody likes swans.\nNot surprisingly for such a huge and noticeable bird, swans feature more than almost any other species in myths and legends, art and literature, across much of the northern hemisphere.\nAncient swan myths include Leda and the Swan. This dates back to ancient Greece, when the all-powerful god Zeus supposedly turned himself into a swan so that he could approach \u2013 and then seduce \u2013 Leda, Queen of Sparta. This story has featured prominently in art, poems and music by, among others, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, WB Yeats and Lou Reed, all of whom were seemingly captivated by the taboo subject of sex between a swan and a woman.\nPerhaps the most celebrated depiction of swans is in Tchaikovsky\u2019s stunning Swan Lake, the most performed, and possibly best-loved, ballet of all time. As well as the wonderful music, its popularity is surely also due to the visual beauty of the white swan at the heart of the story. A darker side to swans was explored in the 2010 film Black Swan, starring Natalie Portman, a tale of rivalry and madness, which swept the board at the following year\u2019s Oscars.\nAmid all this history, mythology and culture, it is easy to forget that the swan is a real bird which, despite its size, can also be extremely vulnerable. As well as suffering from bird flu, swans can die from attacks by dogs, plastic waste, discarded fishing tackle, collisions with pylons or wind turbines, and \u2013 a very current threat \u2013 waterways polluted with raw sewage.\nAt the end of the first lockdown in summer 2020, there was also a steep rise in the number of swans being deliberately killed with airguns and catapults \u2013 often leaving behind cygnets to starve to death. As a nation we may love swans, but we also cause them untold harm.\nThe Swan: A Biography, by Stephen Moss (Square Peg) is out now.

There\u2019s also a parcours d\u2019oeuvres d\u2019art, a walking route around the city\u2019s many frescoes and outdoor sculptures.\nBiarritz\u2019s assets include the sea, the mountains, the countryside and the Spanish border, but we have three golden retrievers, so green spaces are very important to us. There are two wonderful lakes just outside the city, Lac Mouriscot and Lac Marion. Mouriscot is popular with joggers and cyclists: it has wide, wild pathways through the woods and plenty of benches overlooking the lake. Marion, which is equally good for dogs and families, has a bucolic lakeside path, some areas of marshland, plus lots of mature trees and lawns. Both can be reached on bus route 5 from the centre of town, heading past Biarritz\u2019s horse racing track.\nBiarritz\u2019s Grande Plage and casino seafront can become very crowded in the summer, so it is best to visit out of season, but the Port des P\u00eacheurs to the south is always wonderful. Set on a natural creek, the protected harbour has a \u201cvillage\u201d of 65 cabins known as crampottes \u2013 whitewashed fishing huts built into the rock, with red, blue or bright green shutters. They have hardly changed in 150 years, though a few have been turned into cafes and restaurants. There is a 19-year waiting list to rent one \u2013 you have to own a boat and a mooring in the fishing port. The port sits beneath the old whale-watching tower and is the most authentic and charming stretch of the Biarritz seafront. It has a little beach, and lanes draped with floats, fishing nets and the occasional giant anchor.\nLe Bar Jean, at the heart of Biarritz\u2019s tapas, paella and beef-eating culture since the 1930s, stays open until well after midnight, as do many of the pintxos (tapas) bars around Les Halles market. It\u2019s popular to go from bar to bar in Biarritz, tasting tapas with Basque cider, which is poured into tiny, round glasses from high above the table so the cider becomes aerated, though it is quite sour and vinegary! Or, if you are at the beach along the city\u2019s C\u00f4te des Basques, it\u2019s only 100 steps up to Bar Etxola Bibi, a great place to watch the sunset with a cocktail and plate of pintxos.\nClose to the beaches and Les Halles, Villa Koegui (doubles from \u20ac85, breakfast \u20ac15pp) was renovated this year. It has a stylish lounge, an outdoor terrace and family suites.",

At its most effective, Zhao\u2019s film-making is delicate and intimate, capturing fragile human connections with warmth and naturalism. Exactly the kind of thing that gets crushed to oblivion by the steamroller action onslaught of a comic-book movie. Certainly in terms of the look of the film, aside from a few wistful magic-hour shots, there\u2019s little to indicate that Zhao\u2019s guiding vision was able to swim against the tide of prevailing genre conventions.\nBut elsewhere, there are hints of Zhao\u2019s sensibility, not least in the diversity in the writing and casting of the Eternals: a group of immortal humanoids billeted on Earth and tasked with protecting humanity from the destructive appetites of the Deviants (depicted in the film as part lizard, part rage, part high-tensile cable). Leader of the Eternals is Salma Hayek as Ajak; the most powerful is Ikaris (Richard Madden); the most accomplished warrior is Thena (Angelina Jolie), but it\u2019s the empathetic Sersi (Gemma Chan) who is central to the story. Kumail Nanjiani is hammy fun as Kingo, who has hidden out on Earth as a multi-generational Bollywood acting dynasty and insists on saving the planet with his valet in tow. The cast also includes deaf actor Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, and has Brian Tyree Henry playing Marvel\u2019s first openly gay superhero. But for all the effort that has gone into ensuring representation in the casting, the storytelling, with its forced flashbacks and synthetic sentiment, lets the whole thing down.",

Probably, but the Rafiq affair has forced me to revaluate my relationship with the club\nI wake up this morning desperately sad and ashamed. I\u2019m not a member of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, but I watch them play three or four times a year. Those are some of my favourite moments of the summer and I look forward to the season starting and I hate it coming to an end, but all that feels tainted now.\nThe thing I can\u2019t get over, that almost makes me tear up, is that young lad, Azeem Rafiq, a gifted cricketer, sitting in the dressing room, probably doing something he\u2019d always wanted to do, but feeling completely undermined. I want to feel proud of Yorkshire CCC but it seems they are a narrow, very white, old, institution where people I know would not feel welcome.\nI played at a low level for a couple of years in the Pontefract League and I absolutely loved it. There is lots to admire in that dedication to Yorkshire cricket and the idea that it\u2019s a hard sport, that you work at your craft and that you pass your skills on to the next generation. However, it was crushingly parochial and there wasn\u2019t an inclusive view of what Yorkshireness was. Those people who were in senior positions in league cricket are exactly the sort of people who get voted on to the Yorkshire committee.\nI\u2019ve not seen any overt racism at games, but it is not particularly welcoming of people who aren\u2019t a certain template. I have no trouble at all in believing that Yorkshire are an institutionally racist club.\nMembership of a county cricket club only makes sense if you\u2019re retired and I fully intended to become a Yorkshire member the day I retired. Yorkshire are a membership club, it is not like they can be bought out by some wealth fund in Saudi Arabia, and that organisation is going to reflect the views and mores of its membership. That\u2019s a real problem.\nI\u2019m not convinced there would be a huge push from the membership to change but the reality of sponsors dropping out and Tests and ODIs being taken away might change some views \u2013 I hope so. If I were a sponsor of Yorkshire, I would pull out as well and I say this as someone who loves the club and is steeped in its history. Why would you want to be associated with an organisation that acts like that; it\u2019s a no-brainer. Yorkshire have become pariahs in cricket because of what has been exposed and rightly so.\nIf I used the words reported in my job as an NHS commissioner, my feet wouldn\u2019t touch the floor, I\u2019d be out of there. The idea you can use the P-word as banter is unbelievable. But I\u2019ve done stuff in my younger days that I\u2019m glad social media was not around to record and everyone deserves a second chance.\nI don\u2019t happen to think Gary Ballance or Michael Vaughan are unpleasant people or racist in their heart, but the fact the investigation found the organisation had allowed a culture where those kind of words were used, and used against teammates, I stand open-mouthed. As a wider point, it is unfair for today\u2019s players to have to pick up the collective guilt.\nA culture of a place is always driven from the top and any organisation tends to reflect the feeling and views of the people there. Having read the statement Roger Hutton gave, he genuinely tried to do his best but he couldn\u2019t get people on the executive board to take it seriously.\nI don\u2019t know enough about everything that went on but I would be tempted to think the club needs a top-down reorganisation.\nWill I go and see Yorkshire next season? Probably, but this has forced me to re-evaluate my relationship with the club. I want to see a clear road map, acknowledging everything that has happened and what they are going to do about it, a clear vision that Yorkshire CCC are a club for everyone in Yorkshire.\nThe way it was handled was almost designed to put the club in the worst possible light, react late, half-hearted, badly and then bury it under the carpet. We\u2019re not going to bury it under the carpet, this is not OK.",

        "content": "An investigation that led to the boss\u2019s resignation was just the latest in a series of upsets during his stint at the bank\nIn August 2012, while sailing off Sweden in his 28-metre yacht the Bequia, Jes Staley took a series of calls that left him with the impression he was about to become chief executive of Barclays. The American had been in discussions with the outgoing Barclays chairman, Marcus Agius, and his successor.\nStaley was passed over for the post at the time, and wouldn\u2019t be appointed to the top job for another three years. While this gave him more time for sailing, in 2015, he made one trip he may wish he hadn\u2019t: to see convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein on his private Caribbean island.\nThat visit was at the centre of the scandal that last week saw Staley fall on his sword after a run-in with City of London regulators. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority had started investigating Staley\u2019s dealings with Epstein. The late financier, who died in prison in 2019, had been a client when Staley was running JP Morgan\u2019s private banking division, but the two men stayed in contact after Staley left the bank and after Epstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008.\n\u201cObviously I thought I knew him well, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Staley told reporters last year when the inquiry was made public. \u201cWith hindsight \u2026 I deeply regret having had any relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\nThe investigation\u2019s findings have yet to be released, but Staley\u2019s resignation suggests regulators were not happy with his ties to the disgraced financier. Staley has already decided to challenge, rather than accept, the regulator\u2019s judgments.\nStaley\u2019s arrival in 2015 was meant to herald a fresh start for the beleaguered bank. Barclays had ousted two bosses in less than four years, and a third was under investigation over a deal with Qatari investors. It needed an experienced pair of hands to revive its investment bank and restore its wider reputation, particularly in the wake of the Libor scandal.\nEnter Staley, then 58 and the first outsider to lead Barclays in nearly a decade. His strong track record included 30 years at JP Morgan, where he was once seen as a credible successor to boss Jamie Dimon. Staley declared he was ready and willing to clean up Barclays\u2019s image.\n\u201cI feel keenly we must continue to strengthen trust in Barclays,\u201d Staley said in a memo after his appointment. He promised a \u201ccultural transformation\u201d and an end to the kind of behaviour that led to the Libor scandal and forced his predecessor Bob Diamond to resign. He said he wanted to foster a \u201ccollaborative, not adversarial\u201d relationship with the City watchdogs.\nBarclays had become what author Philip Augar called a \u201cfull-throttle capitalist machine\u201d \u2013 a far cry from its roots as a Quaker bank founded on London\u2019s Lombard Street 300 years earlier. Staley\u2019s declared ambition was to \u201crestore Barclays to its rightful standing \u2013 successful, admired and well regarded by all\u201d. But in his six years as chief executive, Staley added three more controversies to the mix, and arguably left the bank nursing more wounds than he was able to heal.\nThe Epstein investigation was not his first run-in with the FCA.\nIn 2018, Staley was fined almost \u00a3650,000, and ordered to repay \u00a3500,000 of his bonus, for having attempted to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Staley was found to have deployed the bank\u2019s internal security to try to discover the author of letters to the board flagging a new hire who was a former friend of Staley\u2019s at JP Morgan. Even the US postal service was unwittingly enlisted to try track down the whistleblower, who Staley feared was trying to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d his co-worker.\nThis caused embarrassment for the bank, which, until last year, had to report annually to regulators on its handling of whistleblowers. Investors expressed anger both about the incident and about the board\u2019s unanimous backing for Staley. Barclays\u2019s chairman at the time, John McFarlane, said his chief executive had merely made a \u201cmistake.\u201d\nA second controversy emerged in late 2017, when Staley caused a rift between private equity giant KKR and Barclays by backing his brother-in-law in a complicated legal dispute with the buyout house. While Staley argued that he was involved in a personal capacity, rather than as chief executive of Barclays, it strained the bank\u2019s relationship with a long-time client and raised further concerns over how private matters were affecting his work.\nIn the wake of these scandals, one shareholder went so far as to declare at the subsequent annual general meeting that, particularly following the whistleblower scandal, Staley\u2019s role as chief executive was \u201cirrevocably tarnished\u201d. Then chairman John McFarlane dug his heels in, insisting that Staley did \u201cnot deserve to resign\u201d.\nUnlike in Diamond\u2019s case, Staley\u2019s alleged misjudgment had not drawn the kind of public and political pressure that would potentially force a high-profile resignation. What\u2019s more, Staley was making better progress on turning around the group\u2019s investment banking arm than Diamond\u2019s replacement, Antony Jenkins, had.\nStaley has been riding a strong investment banking cycle, which helped push the bank\u2019s year-to-date profit to an all-time high of \u00a36.9bn in September, but even so, analysts have praised his success in helping solidify and diversify the Barclays model.\n\u201cThe most significant mark he left on Barclays is having transformed it into a global corporate and investment banking powerhouse,\u201d said John Cronin of stockbroker Goodbody. Barclays has this year overtaken Credit Suisse in terms of investment banking revenue, and outlasted activist investor Edward Bramson, who for years pushed for a winding-down of its investment banking activities.\nStaley\u2019s reputation has undoubtedly been called into question. While he joins Diamond and Jenkins in the list of recently ousted chief executives, only time \u2013 and the outcome of his battle with regulators \u2013 will decide whether he is remembered for harming or restoring Barclays\u2019s fortunes.\n This article was amended on 8 November 2021 to clarify that Barclays\u2019s requirement to report to regulators annually on its handling of whistleblowers ended last year.",

        "content": "The UK\u2019s long-running productivity problems are not being solved \u2013 but they must be if the economy is to get greener\nRishi Sunak says his tax and spending plans, outlined in the budget, will boost the outlook for private sector jobs, wages and growth. The Bank of England\u2019s most recent review of the economy begs to differ.\nIt might appear that the recovery is strong and that companies can barely keep pace with customer demand. Sadly, appearances can be deceptive. If anything, the archetypal mainstream UK business \u2013 the one that stays out of the limelight, doesn\u2019t attend award ceremonies or even bother to join the local chamber of commerce \u2013 will continue to look and behave like a zombie, staggering along with the same old equipment and outmoded technology.\nThese are the firms that kept workers furloughed up to the last day of the government\u2019s job subsidy scheme in September before deciding whether to make them redundant or not. Mostly small in size, they are simultaneously the bedrock of the business community and a drag on innovation in what is now rightly seen as the only worthwhile economic utility \u2013 green growth.\nSunak spent much of the budget talking up the rebound from Covid and promising to deliver an economy built on research and development with the practical benefit for workers of higher productivity and higher wages in years to come.\nThis reward for voting Tory and backing Brexit will also, Tory strategists believe, keep people voting Conservative at the next election and ease their growing fears that hard Brexit was a major mistake that will damage the economy.\nYet looking ahead to 2023 and 2024, when Covid is expected to be no more than a mild irritant, the UK\u2019s forecasts for business investment and GDP growth are among the lowest in the developed world.\nAccording to the Bank of England\u2019s latest predictions, business investment will jump next year by 17%, to make up for a 13% fall over 2020 and 2021. In 2023, business investment growth falls to 1% and in 2024, the presumed year of the next election, it goes into reverse, tumbling by 4%.\nMuch of the initial rise can be attributed to Sunak\u2019s \u201csuper deduction\u201d on private sector investment, offering 130% tax relief against purchases of new equipment. Due to run out in 2023, it sought to encourage a rush of spending that would bring momentum to his plan for investment in a more innovative, high-skill economy.\nAccording to Sunak\u2019s supporters, he was strapping rocket boosters to the side of the economy. A more accurate image might be a sparkler borrowed from one of this weekend\u2019s Bonfire Night revellers: GDP growth will slump back to 1.5% in 2023 and 1% in 2024, according to the Bank of England.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, agrees with the Bank that investment will rise next year before falling into negative territory at -1% in 2024. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says its members think the super deduction policy is a dud and the rate of growth will peak at 6.5% next year before falling, though not quite below zero.\nSome business leaders are also concerned that the hike in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023 will play an important role in deterring investment.\nThe BCC\u2019s chief economist, Suren Thiru, says the continuation of a decade or more of low investment is probably connected to the uncertainty surrounding so many of the government\u2019s economic plans, from \u201clevelling up\u201d the regions to reforming business rates. There are statements of intent from ministers about the need for change, he says, but no one has a clue as to how these plans will be implemented.\nIn aggregate, businesses have more cash in reserve than they did when the pandemic started, but there is a huge divide between large firms that found their goods in high demand over the past 18 months and those that have suffered shock after shock \u2013 first lockdowns, then labour shortages and more recently the prospect of spiralling inflation.\nWhich brings us back to the long tail of indebted zombie firms that the Bank of England\u2019s former chief economist, Andy Haldane, said went some way to explaining the UK\u2019s long-running productivity gap with the rest of the developed world.\nThis type of firm probably won\u2019t go bust. And it may provide a generous income for its owners. But there are no mega pay rises for workers on offer here, if only because these firms don\u2019t think they can afford to innovate more than is absolutely necessary to stay in business.\nThey will answer the jobs-shortage question by not doing so much work, or by asking customers to delay their plans \u2013 building up backlogs, which is what we see in the data at the moment. The only compensation for workers at these firms is cheap credit \u2013 which goes some way to explaining why the Bank of England has yet to find a good time to raise interest rates.",

But publicity for the production prompted angry complaints about Jewish stereotyping. In response, the famous venue on Sloane Square in London has now apologised and agreed to change the name, admitting that it was \u201cunconscious bias\u201d that had led to the Silicon Valley billionaire in the work being given this identity.\nIn an official statement, the theatre management added that the character in Smith\u2019s play, Rare Earth Mettle, which stars former Doctor Who actor Arthur Darvill, is not Jewish and that there is no reference to his faith or Jewishness in the show.\nAmong those to question the planned use of the name Hershel Fink were Adam Lenson, the director and producer, and David Baddiel, the writer and comedian.\n\u201cThe Royal Court claims they didn\u2019t realise \u2018Hershel Fink\u2019 was a Jewish name. Hmmm. Somehow it just sounded so right for a world-conquering billionaire,\u201d Baddiel posted on Twitter. This February, Baddiel\u2019s new book, Jews Don\u2019t Count, argued that antisemitic bias is the one prejudice that remains largely unpoliced in the \u201cculture wars\u201d.\nLenson was also critical on Twitter about the Royal Court taking \u201ca character so clearly based on Elon Musk\u201d and giving him \u201can obviously Jewish name\u201d. He added: \u201cCasually making a Silicon Valley billionaire Jewish perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes and will cause ideological harm.\u201d\nLaura McGrady, who is a writer, questioned the venue\u2019s claim to be unaware of the connotations of the name. \u201cIf I\u2019m believing that no one noticed the problem here \u2026 which, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not believing that at all. Then am I supposed to believe that writers give characters names from specific cultures or origins without even noticing? Seems a reach to me.\u201d\nSet on a salt flat in South America, Rare Earth Mettle is a campaigning piece about the damage inflicted by powerful tech industries. The original Fink character was the chief executive of an electric car company and has been compared to Elon Musk in interviews with Smith.\nThe Royal Court said: \u201cWe are grateful to the members of the Jewish community who got in touch with the Royal Court to communicate the name of one of the characters in Rare Earth Mettle is antisemitic.\n\u201cFor clarification, the character is not Jewish and there is no reference to being Jewish in the play. We acknowledge that this is an example of unconscious bias and we will reflect deeply on how this has happened in the coming days. We and the writer are deeply sorry for harm caused. In response to our learning the writer has changed the name, as of last night.\u201d\nSmith, who has written for Holby City and EastEnders, as well as for radio, penned the recent acclaimed ambulance service-based series of dramas, Life Lines, for BBC Radio 4. He said that he had deliberately aimed at a wide array of targets while writing Rare Earth Mettle, covering racism as well as many of the challenges facing both the global economy and ecology.\nBaddiel ironically paraphrased Smith\u2019s ambition on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019ve written a play. Everything \u2013 particularly now and particularly about ethnicity \u2013 gets relentlessly discussed. Except as regards one ethnicity apparently.\u201d And he commented: \u201cIt\u2019s still a very instructive Jews Don\u2019t Count episode.\u201d\nBut Baddiel later recognised that the theatre and playwright had subsequently done the correct thing in responding to public dismay and changing the name.",

In that month, there were 107 refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru at a cost to taxpayers of $464,486 a month for each person, or more than $15,000 a day.\nThe average monthly cost in 2021 is $358,646 for every refugee and asylum seeker held on the island, equal to $4.3m per person each year, a Guardian Australia analysis of government figures provided to the Senate shows.\nThe majority \u2013 78 of those people \u2013 are refugees whose claims for protection have been formally recognised and Australia is legally obliged to protect them. Others are still awaiting a final refugee status determination, or have had their claim rejected.\nThere are no women, children or family groups remaining among those held by Australia on Nauru. There are only single men, meaning services around maternal health, infant healthcare and childhood education are no longer being provided.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs told the Guardian that \u201cregional processing in Nauru remains a key pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders\u201d.\n\u201cCosts associated with regional processing have saved lives at sea, by providing ongoing deterrence against illegal maritime people smuggling.\u201d\nBut Labor argues Australia\u2019s spending on Nauru is opaque.\nThe government has declined to tell the Senate to whom it has paid nearly $400m to help run the regime on Nauru.\nResponses to Senate questions on notice show that from November 2017 to January 2021, the Australian government spent more than $1.67bn on \u201cgarrison and welfare\u201d for those held on the island.\nThe vast majority of that \u2013 nearly $1.3bn \u2013 was paid to its three \u201cprimary entities\u201d: construction and facilities management firm Canstruct International; healthcare provider International Health and Medical Services (IHMS); and the government of Nauru.\nCanstruct was paid a little over $1bn to provide garrison and welfare services; IHMS received $138.3m to provide healthcare; and the Nauru government was paid $73.3m.\nThe total cost to the three \u201cprimary entities\u201d identified by the department was $1,272,681,862.\nBut Australia\u2019s total payments for garrison and welfare services on Nauru were $1,671,500,000, according to government figures, with an additional $398,818,138 paid to other individuals, organisations, or governments.\nUnder questioning from Labor in the Senate, the department said it would not provide details on to whom that additional money was paid.\n\u201cPayment data subsequently recorded in the Department\u2019s Financial Management Information System is not disaggregated \u2026 and the manual intervention required to identify this level of detail constitutes an unreasonable diversion of resources.\u201d\nSenator Kristina Keneally, the shadow minister for home affairs, said Scott Morrison\u2019s government had serious questions to answer over the escalating costs of offshore processing on Nauru.\n\u201cThis is yet another example of Mr Morrison using taxpayers money as if it was Liberal Party money.\u201d\nKeneally said the government\u2019s response to the Senate that payments could not be detailed publicly was inadequate, arguing the Australian people \u201cabsolutely have a right to know how it has been spent\u201d.\n\u201cWe are not talking about a missing tin of petty cash. This is $400m. Where did it go? Has it gone into the pockets of Liberal mates? Has it been lost?\n\u201cThe Morrison government either doesn\u2019t know what has happened to this $400m or it doesn\u2019t want Australians to know.\u201d\nThe Department of Home Affairs told the Guardian \u201cthe questions on notice seek different types of information, and as such are not directly comparable\u201d.\n\u201cThe figures provided in response to various questions reflect payments made to suppliers on a cash basis with total expenditure accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result, the figures will not neatly total or realise month-to-month consistency.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands the \u201ctotal\u201d costs figure for Nauru captures all expenses related to regional processing there, including ancillary costs such as government administration, transport, road maintenance, utilities, staff accommodation, land leases, staffing costs and legal services.\nCanstruct\u2019s large and growing contract \u2013 now worth nearly $1.6bn \u2013 to run the Nauru facility has attracted particular scrutiny.\nThe Brisbane company, which is a Liberal party donor, helped build the Nauru detention centre, and started running the offshore regime on the island in late 2017.\nThe original contract awarded to Canstruct for services on Nauru was worth just $8m in October 2017. But this was amended almost immediately, increased by 4,500% to $385m just a month after being signed.\nSince then, seven further amendments have escalated the cost to taxpayers to $1,598,230,689 a total increase of more than 19,300%, government tender documents show.\nThe eighth and latest amendment to the contract was published this month, with another $179m to continue operating on the island until the end of 2021.\nThe contract was awarded under limited tender, with \u201cno submissions or value for money submissions received\u201d, government tender documents show.\nCanstruct, or individuals or entities associated with it, has made at least 11 donations to the Coalition since 2017, according to state electoral disclosures. The company has previously strenuously denied any link between political donations and the awarding of any contracts.\nAsked about Canstruct\u2019s Nauru operations, a spokesperson for the company said: \u201cUnfortunately we are unable to comment on these matters. Please direct any questions to the federal government.\u201d\nIn September, the Australian government signed an agreement with the government of Nauru for an \u201cenduring\u201d offshore processing regime on the island.\nAustralia\u2019s offshore processing arrangement with Papua New Guinea will end on 31 December this year. In 2017, Australia\u2019s detention centre on PNG\u2019s Manus Island was ruled unconstitutional and the detention of people there illegal. Australia was required to pay more than $70m in compensation.",

        "content": "Looking closely at how Scott Morrison has succeeded \u2013 and the ways in which he has failed \u2013 can tell us a lot about politics, and journalism, and Australians\nIn 2018, I was approached about writing a profile of Scott Morrison, the new prime minister. I read everything I could and talked to as many people as would talk to me. Then I began to cut and paste snippets into folders on my computer: \u201cImmigration\u201d, \u201cReligion\u201d, \u201cAmbition\u201d, \u201cMr Average\u201d.\nI stared at these facts for a long time. Politicians are very often catalogued by their beliefs. This makes sense: it is arguably the most important thing about them. In Morrison\u2019s case, it was hard to know what to say. He had, over a period of decades, said little definitive; on the occasions he had made clear statements, he had undermined them elsewhere. His language tended to the general, so that it was hard to take away anything clear.\nFinally, I had one of those moments that every writer hopes for, when you realise that what you thought had been blocking your way is, in fact, the thing you have been looking for all along. This apparent lack of definition was the defining characteristic of Morrison\u2019s public life. The profile was published with the title Leave No Trace.\nI thought that was it for me and Morrison \u2013 and when a publisher asked me about writing a biography, I wasn\u2019t keen. The man wasn\u2019t that interesting, and I wasn\u2019t convinced I could sustain an entire book about him.\nBut then I had a similar revelation. The fact he seemed boring wasn\u2019t an obstacle: it was the opening. Here was a man who was on display all the time, yet we knew so little about him \u2013 and nobody seemed to want to know more. And he had become prime minister! How had he pulled off this trick?\nOf course, no one can avoid leaving traces altogether. In order to write this book, I looked very closely at everything Morrison had said and done over decades in public life. Because he hadn\u2019t done very much, this meant examining in detail what he\u2019d said: the gaps, the contradictions, the startling swerves, the patterns.\nThis close examination is precisely what Morrison does not want.\nThe book that resulted is not a straight biography. My approach, at times, veered closer to literary criticism than political journalism. If that sounds odd, it\u2019s worth remembering that, for most of us, politicians are not that different from characters out of books. What do we know about them other than what we are told by the people who craft the news bulletins that we watch and listen to, and who write the articles that we read?\nWhile I doubt Morrison would put it in those terms, this is something he understands better than any politician in the country. When there was first a hint that he might become prime minister, in 2015, he set about creating a very simple character: Sco-Mo, who cooks curries once a week and likes footy. To put this another way: he knew that the journalists who wrote the story of his life would need material, and he set about providing it. He gave them other elements, too: he was pragmatic and \u2013 this seems almost implausible by now \u2013 \u201cauthentic\u201d. That was, more or less, enough to win him an election.\nThis brought another implication with it. If each politician is like a character from a book, then journalists are, in effect, the collective authors of that book. Any examination of the character that Morrison had created would have to look closely at the journalistic habits that made his success possible. The notion of objectivity is important, but often is used as an excuse for uncritically repeating what politicians say. Too many in the media too readily treat politics as a game, with political cleverness admired more than substance.\nAlong the way, I considered writing a different type of book. Every author does this. Every book that is written, like every life that is lived, has ghosts hovering behind it, of the things it might have been but, finally, was not.\nFor a long time, I thought the aim of the book would be to discover the \u201creal\u201d man behind the performance. With time, I decided that this was, in a sense, searching for some sort of alibi for Morrison, as though what he had done in public did not matter. Hadn\u2019t Morrison been visible to us for some time, provided you were willing to pay attention?\nWhat, at this stage, might dramatically shift our sense of him as a prime minister? That he was kind in private? Or, alternatively, what might we learn from discovering, say, that he had some secret religious belief that the climate crisis didn\u2019t matter? What would that change?\nEstablishing facts is important. But, as Eve Sedgwick argued decades ago, there are times when a hunt for the hidden story can distract us from seeing what is in front of us.\nWhile I did not ultimately write that other book, considering such questions gave me the final element of this one. If many of us have not been willing to look closely at Morrison, why is that? This tells us something about Morrison, but doesn\u2019t it tell us something about ourselves as well? He fought his way to the top of some of Australia\u2019s most powerful institutions. Then he convinced many Australians to vote for him. Why were many of us willing to accept the stories he told us and the image he presented?\nLooking closely at the ways in which Scott Morrison has succeeded \u2013 and the ways in which he has failed \u2013 can tell us a lot about politics, and journalism, and Australians. Whether most of us want to know those things is questionable. So much of Morrison\u2019s career \u2013 the character he has created, his practised avoidance of scrutiny \u2013 has been built on the knowledge that, most of the time, we don\u2019t.\nThe Game \u2013 A Portrait of Scott Morrison, by Sean Kelly (Black Inc. Books), is out now",

        "content": "Long-awaited agricultural visa could provide much needed labour, but some experts fear potential for worker exploitation\nA microcosm of Australians\u2019 reluctance to work on farms can be seen in Victoria\u2019s Yarra valley.\nCEO of a group of strawberry farms, Miffy Gilbert, struggled to source labour for the current harvest, while her teenage son works as a shelf-stacker at a supermarket.\nAustralians aren\u2019t lazy, according to Gilbert, we\u2019re simply spoilt for choice in a situation mirrored in most developed countries.\n\u201cAustralians are harder to get, because we\u2019re lucky to have a lot of options in front of us as to what we do for employment,\u201d says Gilbert.\n\u201cWhen I grew up there was not a cafe or three on every corner like there is now.\u201d\nGilbert is also CEO of AusBerry Farmers, a collaborative farming effort between seven families in the Yarra valley.\n\u201cIf I said to him, \u2018I\u2019ve got seven farms, where do you want to work?\u2019 There\u2019s no way. It\u2019s similar money to stacking the fruit and veg shelves in air-conditioned comfort versus sitting in a damp field for half a day.\u201d\nThe Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences is predicting record production values for a second year in a row. The bureau is also reporting a shortage of about 22,000 workers across the country over the next quarter, with 16,000 of these in horticulture. Closed borders have exacerbated the shortage, as has the Australian-UK trade deal in June which removed the farm work requirement for about 10,000 British backpackers to extend their working holiday visas.\nGilbert started sourcing labour almost as soon as the previous harvest finished. She thought she might scrape through.\n\u201cBut with border closures and the lockdown here in Victoria, we think we might be somewhere between 15% to 25% down.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a major issue during the first couple of months up to Christmas, when the picking is fast and furious, and there are larger volumes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky in strawberries that there are ways to manage the crop to reduce the peak so it might be 20% less, which you aren\u2019t able to do with a lot of other crops.\u201d\nMore than $60m worth of crop losses have been self-reported by farmers nationally since mid-2020, but the actual figure is likely to be far higher.\nThe federal government\u2019s response has been two fold: try to attract Australians to take up farm work, in conjunction with overseas seasonal workers.\nAn agricultural visa has long been on the horizon. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised in June to have the visa in place by the end of the year, after the announcement of the UK trade deal, but details remain vague.\nThe other potential solution was an incentive of $6,000 for Australians to relocate for work. Former deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, even noted the Instagram opportunities for young Australians in regional locations.\nEarlier this year I picked grapes on a farm in Western Australia, after satisfying the requirements of the federal government\u2019s relocation assistance to take up a job program, (since rebranded as AgMove).\nMy correspondence with Harvest Trail Information Services (HTIS) began in mid-December 2020. Despite an extensive paperwork trail, I am yet to receive a cent of the incentive, despite picking my last grape more than seven months ago.\nMaddy Muller and Riley Harrington, originally from Bendigo, are in the same boat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nearly six months since we finished fruit picking, and we haven\u2019t received payment as yet,\u201d said Muller.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the process should be this tedious, especially as there was a real concern with the [labour] shortages.\u201d\nGilbert is optimistic about what the visa will offer, but says diversifying is key when it comes to sourcing labour.\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably looking to spread our risk, and not have all our eggs in one basket. Our workforce are great people who all work really hard. We\u2019d love to have some more backpackers, but there aren\u2019t too many in this area.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about the agriculture visa and we\u2019re already looking at what that looks like for us.\u201d\nNot all are as buoyant. Deputy program director of migration at the Grattan Institute, Henry Sherrell, specialises in labour markets and immigration policy.\nWhile acknowledging the agricultural visa\u2019s obvious benefits, Sherrell fears it also has the potential to expose migrant workers to the sort of exploitation parts of the industry have been infamous for in the past.\n\u201cI think it has the potential to change things quite a bit, but I actually think for the worse,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI think the biggest risk is that exploitation becomes more common. This is a really, really big change, and I think it\u2019s got a little bit of attention, but probably not quite the attention it deserves.\u201d\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nAustralian Workers Union national secretary, Daniel Walton, is more blunt.\n\u201cThis visa will undermine the current Pacific labour scheme and the seasonal worker program. Apparently the meagre protections offered to Pacific Islanders under these programs are too luxurious, so the government is keen to offer a visa under which abuse is even easier.\n\u201cIt is crazy that Australia is apparently willing to trash our friendships in the Pacific so a handful of farmers can save a few bucks by treating workers like serfs.\u201d\nThe National Farmer\u2019s Federation general manager of workplace relations, Ben Rogers, said in response to Walton\u2019s comments: \u201cYet again, Mr Walton slurs the farming community with his arrogant and misguided dog-whistle claims.\u201d\n\u201cThe ag visa will be very actively regulated and only available to farms which can satisfy the government that engage with their workers fairly and lawfully.\u201d\nSherrell believes that while it has been a tough few years for labour-intensive farms, there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\u201cThis is a balancing act, and I worry that if we go too far down the path of trying to solve everything with more people and more visas, it will lead to more exploitation, and longer term, a less productive way of doing things.\n\u201cI do think when the borders go back to normal, there\u2019s going to be some pent-up demand for backpackers to come to Australia.\u201d\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

        "content": "Eight people were killed and dozens injured in a crowd surge at a music festival in Houston on Friday night, in what the city\u2019s mayor called \u201ca tragedy on many different levels\u201d.\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Sylvester Turner said the dead ranged in age from 14 to 27, the second teenaged victim being 16 years old. Thirteen of 25 people taken to hospital were still in care, he said, five of them under the age of 18.\nTurner said it was too early to draw conclusions about what went wrong.\nJudge Lina Hidalgo, Harris county\u2019s top elected official, said: \u201cIt may well be that this tragedy is the result of unpredictable events, of circumstances coming together that couldn\u2019t possibly have been avoided. But until we determine that, I will ask the tough questions.\u201d\nThe surge towards the stage at the Astroworld festival occurred just after 9pm, while the rapper Travis Scott was performing. The Houston fire chief, Samuel Pe\u00f1a, said crowd movement caused panic and injuries. Then \u201cpeople began to fall out, become unconscious, and it created additional panic\u201d.\nThe show was called off and the festival cancelled. In a tweet on Saturday, Scott said he was \u201cabsolutely devastated by what took place last night\u201d and pledged to work \u201ctogether with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need\u201d.\nHidalgo told reporters: \u201cWhen we read these ages \u2013 14, 16, 21, 21, 23, 23, 27 \u2013 it just breaks your heart and I know that the images we\u2019ve seen are hard to stomach and I imagine more will surface that are hard to stomach.\u201d\nFamily members for six of the dead had been notified, Turner said, adding that identifying information would not immediately be released. Hidalgo said family for one victim had not been found and one victim had not been identified.\nPolice have opened a criminal investigation. The Houston police chief, Troy Finner, told reporters there were \u201ca lot of narratives out there right now\u201d about alleged criminal behavior among festival-goers.\n\u201cI think that all of us need to be respectful of the families and make sure that we follow the facts and evidence and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do here in the Houston police department,\u201d he said.\nBut he added: \u201cI will tell you, one of the narratives was that some individual was injecting other people with drugs.\n\u201cWe do have a report of a security officer, according to the medical staff that was out and treated him last night, that he was reaching over to restrain a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck. When he was examined he went unconscious. They administered Narcan, he was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject.\u201d\nScott, 29 and a Houston native, founded the Astroworld festival in 2018 and it has taken place at NRG Park each year since except for 2020.\nScott\u2019s performance on Friday was livestreamed by Apple Music. The Houston Chronicle reported that the rapper stopped a number of times during the 75-minute set when he spotted fans in distress, asking security to help them. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the crowd.\nIn a 90-second video released on Twitter on Saturday, Scott said that, while on stage, \u201cI could just not imagine the severity of the situation.\u201d He described himself as \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d by the incident.\nA senior Houston police officer, Larry Satterwhite, was near the front. He said it seemed the surge \u201chappened all at once\u201d.\n\u201cSuddenly we had several people down on the ground, experiencing some type of cardiac arrest or some type of medical episode,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we immediately started doing CPR, and moving people right then, and that\u2019s when I went and met with the promoters and they agreed to end early in the interest of public safety.\u201d\nAn audience member, Seanna Faith McCarty, described the chaos.\n\u201cWithin the first 30 seconds of the first song, people began to drown \u2013 in other people,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe rush of people became tighter and tighter. Breathing became something only a few were capable of. The rest were crushed or unable to breathe in the thick, hot air.\u201d\nSuddenly, McCarty said, she realized she and those around her were at risk of being trampled to death.\n\u201cIt was like watching a Jenga tower topple,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPerson after person were sucked down. You could not guess from which direction the shove of hundreds of people would come next. You were at the mercy of the wave.\u201d\nOfficials transported 17 people to hospital, including 11 in cardiac arrest, Pe\u00f1a said. Event promoters had arranged for medical units to be on the scene but they were \u201cquickly overwhelmed\u201d. More than 300 were treated in a field hospital. Pe\u00f1a said one person hurt was 10 years old. Approximately 50,000 people attended the event, Pe\u00f1a added.\nThe fire department set up a reunification centre at a hotel, for families who had not heard from loved ones. The Houston office of emergency management created a hotline for people unable to contact festival-goers.\nOn Saturday, Hidalgo told reporters she \u201cspent time at the reunification center talking to families, hearing their anguish, those that didn\u2019t know where their loved ones were\u201d.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s harder not to know,\u201d she said.\nIt was the most accidental deaths at a US concert since the Station nightclub fire, which killed 100 people in Rhode Island in 2003.\nIn a statement, organizers said: \u201cOur hearts are with the Astroworld festival family tonight \u2013 especially those we lost and their loved ones.\u201d",

        "content": "Granted there is an injury crisis, but it has not been a great start and the beloved manager needs to steer between extremes\nThe problem with any discussion of Marcelo Bielsa is the tendency immediately to speak in grand broadbrush terms; everybody already knows what they think about him. It\u2019s the curse of our age that positions so rapidly become entrenched, even when it comes to the ostensibly trivial issue of how football should be played.\nNobody can ever simply question the way Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r structures a midfield or his organisation of the press or ask whether the inclusion of Cristiano Ronaldo might have made those issues worse, without immediately being cast as anti-Ole or anti-Manchester United, revelling in every goal conceded.\nIt feels as though football exported a particularly blinkered tribalism to wider culture and has since accepted it back with added paranoia and conspiracy theory. (The most absurd recent example is the idea that to be sickened by Saudi human rights abuses is to participate in a decades-long hate campaign against the city of Newcastle. It\u2019s difficult, isn\u2019t it? Is it possible to be anti-torture without also being anti-Geordie?)\nBut, Bielsa. He has divided people everywhere he has been, which is perhaps inevitable given his idiosyncratic and messianic nature. On the one hand, the Argentinian is extremely down-to-earth, drinking coffee in Costa, eating in a local Italian restaurant, dressing in a club tracksuit, apparently unconcerned by anything outside football \u2013 and yet simultaneously extremely sensitive to the sport\u2019s role in society and the importance clubs play in the local community.\nThere is an integrity and a humility to him. But at the same time, he is stubborn and demanding, idealistic and so sure of his own mind that he insists on, for instance, the training ground being redesigned to his specifications.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Leeds fans love him. Not only did he take them back to the Premier League after a 16-year absence, but he has given them a style and an identity. It\u2019s not so much that he has made football fun, although he has certainly done that, as that he has given Leeds a team of which they can be proud.\nThey are not the first fans to feel that way about him. In 2015, four years after he had left the Chile job, I had to have some passport photos taken in Santiago. It turned out Bielsa had once used the shop I went to and so three walls of the studio were covered in tiny pictures of him, thousands of Bielsas staring at you like being trapped in the poster for Being John Malkovich. Why? \u201cBecause he is Bielsa.\u201d\nBut that level of devotion makes criticism difficult. The issue of fatigue dominated his first two seasons in the Championship. Leeds fans hated the suggestion that burnout had caused them to miss the automatic slots in his first season and even more the idea that the Covid shutdown facilitated promotion in his second.\nThe way Leeds finished last season, with one defeat in their final 11 games, would suggest they had a point. Yet the question was relevant: given Bielsa\u2019s previous history, at Newell\u2019s Old Boys and Marseille in particular, why was burnout not a factor? How has he adapted to avoid it? Sensitivities around the question mean it has never really been answered.\nSet against that are those who see Bielsa as a hipster affectation, those frustrated by his reluctance or inability to conduct post-match interviews in the familiar English cliches, those who wonder just how great a manager can be when in 30 years he has won three Argentinian championships, Olympic gold and promotion with Leeds. Such is the factionalism of the modern world, Leeds fans probably aren\u2019t wrong to believe that there are some who would like him to fail.\nWhich brings us to this season. Leeds went into the weekend fourth bottom of the Premier League, having won two of their first 10 games. They have failed to beat Burnley and Newcastle. This season looks like being a struggle against relegation. And that has led to claims that Bielsa has been worked out. The past couple of weeks have even brought wild suggestions that the 66-year-old should be replaced \u2013 ludicrous, perhaps, but serious enough for the club owner, Andrea Radrizzani, to feel the need to rebuff them after last Sunday\u2019s win at Norwich.\nPart of the problem is another recurring theme of the age, the need for constant growth or expansion. Having finished ninth last season, with the highest points total for a promoted side in two decades, where, realistically, was there for Leeds to go? Their wage bill remains one of the five lowest in the division (although that may change, bringing its own pressures, if the transfer of shares from Radrizzani to 49ers Enterprises goes on).\nLeicester, who Leeds face on Sunday, have faced a similar problem: just because they have finished fifth in the past two seasons doesn\u2019t mean that anything less than that is somehow failure. An extraordinary achievement one season shouldn\u2019t make that the new par.\nWhere Leicester and Leeds have suffered this season is with injuries. Leeds are still without Patrick Bamford, Luke Ayling and Robin Koch, but have also been without Kalvin Phillips, Raphinha and Junior Firpo at times and that has had an effect.\nThe stereotypical criticism of a Bielsa side is that they are too attacking, but this season the problem has been at the other end: 10 goals in 10 games; to have conceded 17, eight of them in two games, is unremarkable.\nAs players return \u2013 and if Joe Gelhardt is as exciting as he appeared against Wolves \u2013 Leeds probably will rally. But it\u2019s not unreasonable at this stage to raise doubts. After all, Bielsa is an exhausting figure and this is already the longest he has spent at any one club.\nIt has not been a great start to the season and he is not beyond reproach; the tendency to divide everybody into Frauds or Goats is corrosive to proper discussion.\nBut whatever happens in the rest of this season, Bielsa has been brilliant for Leeds and his time at the club a rare joy in a world that feels increasingly sick.",

        "content": "Demonstrators at Headingley were joined by the son of former captain Azeem Rafiq amid unconnected claims that staff were targeted\nThe continuing racism scandal at Yorkshire County Cricket Club intensified this weekend with protests outside the ground on Saturday and claims staff have received death threats.\nThe club was plunged into turmoil last week after a report carried out into a culture of racism described the use of the p-slur against former Yorkshire captain Azeem Rafiq as \u201cbanter\u201d that, it said, warranted no further action.\nA protest outside the stadium in Headingley on Saturday saw cricket fans, including Rafiq\u2019s young son, sister and father, call for the release of Yorkshire CCC\u2019s full report and an end to racism in cricket.\nAs heavy rain lashed down on the gathered protesters, Rafiq\u2019s father held a homemade sign that read \u201cRacism is not banter\u201d. Addressing the crowd, Leeds University lecturer Dr Abdul-Bashid Shaikh said: \u201cWe call upon Yorkshire CCC to do the right thing and acknowledge that racism exists and it has fallen short of the standards we expect from such a prestigious club.\u201d He called for Yorkshire to take \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to eliminate institutional racism.\nMohammed Patel, a human rights lawyer who organised the protest, told the Observer: \u201cYorkshire County Cricket Club failed in their duty. No doubt about it. To drag an ex-player through everything that he has endured, to the brink of him thinking of taking his own life, there\u2019s no excuse for that. That\u2019s why everyone is here today.\u201d Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire for two spells between 2008 and 2018, has said he was left feeling suicidal after his treatment by fellow players and a failure to investigate complaints of racism by the Yorkshire CCC board.\nOn Thursday night the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) suspended all internationals and other big games at Yorkshire\u2019s ground and the club\u2019s main sponsors withdrew their support after a public backlash.\nThe former England batsman Mark Ramprakash called for Yorkshire CCC to be \u201cdragged into 2021\u201d after what he said was a \u201cdisappointing\u201d reaction to accusations of racism.\nRamprakash told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday: \u201cThe attitudes of the board show \u2026 a lack of contrition and a lack of understanding of the gravity of what happened. That is what is so disappointing.\u201d A source at the club said that extra security has now been brought in to protect staff working at the cricket ground after some of them received death threats. It is not suggested any of the protesters were involved. Staff said Friday\u2019s Yorkshire CCC board meeting was held over Zoom, instead of in person, for security reasons and that the majority of staff have been told to work from home if possible for the foreseeable future.\nThe club also took down the staff directory from its website on Friday. The events come in the face of anger from cricket fans in Yorkshire over what many see as blatant attempts by the club to sweep the problem of systemic racism under the carpet.\nThe report, which took 12 months to complete and remains unpublished, upheld seven of Rafiq\u2019s 43 allegations and accepted he had faced \u201cracial harassment and bullying\u201d. Yorkshire announced last week that no current employees would face action as a result. Rafiq will give evidence to parliament\u2019s digital, culture, media and sport select committee on 16 November. A second player, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, has said he too had experienced \u201csystematic taunting\u201d and racism at Yorkshire and an additional investigation at the club is now taking place into claims by another unnamed Asian player that he suffered racism and was urinated on by another player.\nThe club\u2019s chairman, Roger Hutton, who was appointed in April 2020, stood down on Friday along with two other board members. In interviews, he accused the ECB of failing to act and not providing necessary support to Yorkshire while it attempted to investigate the racism claims.\nThe ECB has now launched its own investigation to decide whether further sanctions need to be taken.\nOn Friday evening it emerged the Equality and Human Rights Commission had also made contact with Yorkshire requesting access to the full independent report into Rafiq\u2019s claims and was considering whether or not to pursue action against the club.\nHutton has been replaced by Kamlesh Patel, who said there was \u201cmuch work to do\u201d to redress the damage caused by the botched investigation. After his appointment, Lord Patel spoke out about how he had experienced \u201cloads\u201d of racism growing up in Bradford and playing cricket, particularly the use of the p-slur.\n\u201cWhen I was a boy I developed into a very fast runner,\u201d he said in an interview with ESPNcricinfo. \u201cDo you know why? Because gangs of skinheads used to delight in what they called \u2018Paki-bashing\u2019 and you either learned to run or you took a beating.\n\u201cSo that word \u2013 the \u2018Paki\u2019 word \u2013 has real meaning for me. I don\u2019t need to be told it\u2019s not banter.\u201d Having trained as a social worker, Patel chairs Social Work England and is a former chair of the Mental Health Act Commission.\nLarge sponsors such as Nike, Emerald group and Yorkshire Tea withdrew their support for the club with immediate effect. Tetley\u2019s brewery and David Lloyd Clubs said they would not renew their contracts with Yorkshire, while Leeds Beckett University, which teaches at the ground, pulled its branding from Yorkshire CCC\u2019s website.\nRipples from the allegations have hit Michael Vaughan, who was removed by the BBC from Radio 5 live\u2019s The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show on Monday after two cricketers said they heard the former England captain make racist comments while playing for Yorkshire in 2009.\nThe decision came after Vaughan, who has worked as an expert summariser and analyst on Test Match Special for 12 years, was accused of telling three players of Asian descent that there were \u201ctoo many of you lot, we need to do something about it\u201d before a county match in Nottingham.\nYorkshire CCC did not respond to requests for comment. Vaughan strongly denies allegations of racism.",

        "content": "Gareth Southgate said he was surprised to be on the receiving end of barbed comments from J\u00fcrgen Klopp regarding his deployment of Liverpool players, particularly given he professes to enjoy a good working relationship with his counterpart.\nLast month, Klopp questioned the omission of Joe Gomez from Southgate\u2019s squad, pointing out that a lack of top-flight football this season had not prevented John Stones from being selected. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a special thing for Mr Stones,\u201d Klopp said, while he was also critical of Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s use in midfield against Andorra in September. \u201cWhy would you make the best right-back in the world a midfielder? I don\u2019t understand that really,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know why he keeps having a swing, you\u2019d have to ask him,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve always got on reasonably well. I\u2019ve noticed quite a few articles and quite a few comments, which is always interesting to see.\u201d\nSouthgate was asked whether it was important to forge strong bonds with club managers but suggested the industry\u2019s volatility does not make that straightforward. \u201cThey come and go pretty quickly so it\u2019s important to have a good relationship somewhere in the clubs, but maybe the managers [aren\u2019t] the priority because it\u2019s very transient,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be the case with the Liverpool manager, by the way. I\u2019ve got no problem with J\u00fcrgen at all. You\u2019d have to ask him why he\u2019s made the comments he has.\u201d\nAlexander-Arnold has been selected for the squad to face Albania and San Marino over the coming international break but Gomez, who has not started a league game in 2021-22, again misses out.\nOne manager Southgate expects to see more of in the near future is Antonio Conte, who has returned to the Premier League with Spurs and is charged with restoring Harry Kane to his best form. Only one of the England captain\u2019s seven club goals this season has come in the league in the fallout from his failed attempt to depart in pre-season, and Southgate hopes Conte\u2019s influence can set him back on course.\n\u201cNow there\u2019s an opportunity for Harry to be able to put everything behind him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe announced he wanted to stay. Now there\u2019s a change of manager, I think there\u2019s a fresh start for him. That will be a good stimulus for him.\u201d\nSouthgate rejected any suggestion the thought of dropping Kane could have crossed his mind. \u201cHarry has 41 goals in 65 internationals and we need to win a game of football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody we trust more if a chance drops to him than Harry Kane. He\u2019s the outstanding centre-forward of his generation.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the whole thing has been an experience that has been difficult. He\u2019s ended up, understandably, with an adverse reaction from some of the fans there. So he\u2019s had to deal with a lot of unintentional consequences of the possible move in the summer. Antonio coming in is probably a good thing from Harry\u2019s personal point of view. Knowing Antonio as I do \u2013 an outstanding coach, a very good man \u2013 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get a response and a reaction out of Harry very quickly.\u201d",

Real had drawn their last two league games at the the Bernab\u00e9u 0-0 but got off to a strong start when Kroos drilled a shot into the top corner in the 14th minute after Marco Asensio had cut into the area from the right wing.\nTheir top scorer Benzema doubled their lead in the 38th minute and Real looked to be cruising until Radamel Falcao came off the bench in the second half andscored a header, with the help of a deflection off Alaba, to put Rayo back in contention in the 76th minute. The win takes Real on to 27 points after 12 games, two above second-placed Real Sociedad who have also played 12 but will return to the summit if they beat Osasuna on Sunday.\nRobert Lewandowski scored his 60th goal this calendar year as champions Bayern Munich claimed a 2-1 home win over Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday to end the visiting side\u2019s unbeaten start to the season. Bayern took a deserved lead in the 30th minute through Leon Goretzka and Lewandowski doubled the lead on 75 minutes, before Freiburg scored an injury-time consolation through Janik Haberer.\nBorussia Dortmund\u2019s four-game winning streak in the Bundesliga came to a halt as they were beaten 2-1 away to RB Leipzig. Christopher Nkunku put Leipzig in front in the 29th minute and Jesse Marsch\u2019s side missed numerous chances to build on their lead before they were punished by a Marco Reus equaliser early in the second half. Leipzig quickly set about restoring their lead and eventually made good on their dominance when Yusuf Poulsen slid in to send a cross from Nkunku inside the far post in the 68th minute.\nIn Italy, Davide Ballardini\u2019s fourth spell as Genoa coach came to an end on Saturday when the relegation-battling Serie A club announced his sacking. The 57-year-old was under pressure after winning one league game all season, and a 2-2 draw away to Empoli on Friday night proved to be the final straw.\n\u201cGenoa have relieved coach Davide Ballardini of his duties. The club thanks the coach and his staff for their work, dedication and passion,\u201d read a club statement. Genoa are 18th, with nine points from 12 games, and are on a nine-match winless run.\nJuan Cuadrado\u2019s stoppage-time goal earned Juventus a 1-0 win over 10-man Fiorentina as the Turin club ended a three-match winless league run. Juventus are eighth with 18 points, level with Fiorentina above them. Atalanta beat bottom side Cagliari 2-1 in the late game to rise to fourth thanks to first-half strikes from Mario Pasalic and Duvan Zapata either side of a Jo\u00e3o Pedro goal for the hosts.\nParis Saint Germain stretched their advantage at the top of Ligue 1 to 10 points after two goals from the Brazil forward Neymar and another from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 helped them to a 3-2 win at Bordeaux on Saturday. PSG have 34 points from 13 games, ahead of second-placed Lens who beat Troyes 4-0 at home on Friday. Bordeaux stayed 16th on 12 points.",

        "content": "The \u2018ecotype\u2019, thought to have been wiped out by disease and invasive species, is thriving in the estate\u2019s ancient woodlands\nThousands of rare forest honeybees that appear to be the last wild descendants of Britain\u2019s native honeybee population have been discovered in the ancient woodlands of Blenheim Palace.\nThe newly discovered subspecies, or ecotype, of honeybee is smaller, furrier and darker than the honeybees found in managed beehives, and is believed to be related to the indigenous wild honeybees that foraged the English countryside for centuries. Until now, it was presumed all these bees had been completely wiped out by disease and competition from imported species.\nWhile feral honeybee colonies \u2013 usually created by swarms of non-native bees that have left a nearby managed hive \u2013 are occasionally found in the UK, there was no evidence that self-sustaining colonies of native, tree-nesting honeybees still existed in England, and no record of the wild subspecies living in Blenheim.\nFilipe Salbany, a bee conservationist who found 50 colonies of the rare honeybees in Blenheim\u2019s 400-acre estate, said: \u201cThese bees are quite unique in that they live in nests in very small cavities, as bees have for millions of years, and they have the ability to live with disease. They have had no treatment for the varroa mite \u2013 yet they\u2019re not dying off.\u201d\nThe varroa mite, a parasite that feeds on and attacks honeybees, arrived in Britain in 1992 and decimated the UK\u2019s population. Salbany believes the bees he has found have evolved to survive. \u201cWe are not seeing the deaths we would expect to see with varroa.\u201d\nUnusually, the bees swarm with multiple queens \u2013 up to nine in some cases \u2013 to ensure the colony\u2019s survival, and have been recorded foraging for honeydew on the treetops in temperatures as low as 4C. Most bees will stop flying at 12C. \u201cA wild bee that has adapted to the environment is called an ecotype, and this bee could be a very precious ecotype \u2013 the first wild bee that is completely adapted to living in the oak forest.\u201d\nThe results of DNA samples taken from the bees are expected within the next three to four weeks, but Salbany is confident it will show the bees are descendants of an ancient native species. \u201cI think the majority of the genetics are going to be of an old English bee, of something that was here many, many years ago.\u201d\nHis preliminary analysis of the wings of the honeybees strongly suggests they are related to indigenous honeybees that once lived in Britain. \u201cThey are not from the imported stocks of bees that people bring in. The wings are smaller and their veins are very distinct.\u201d\nThe bees\u2019 cubital index, a method for differentiating breeds of honeybees, also confirmed they are \u201cmore of an indigenous bee\u201d than anything else, he said, but their adaptations have made them unique and peculiar, and they have very little banding. \u201cSupposedly, wild tree-nesting honeybees which can sustain themselves do not exist, so nobody knows what type of wild, self-sustaining honeybee is actually left in the UK.\u201d\nOne of the nests he found was at least 200 years old and he estimates that the bees have been living on the Blenheim estate, which dates back to the middle ages, for \u201cquite a few\u201d centuries. Unusually, they have built their nests in tree cavities a quarter of the size of a normal beehive, 15 to 20 metres off the ground, and despite several ecological surveys over the years, \u201cnobody knew they existed\u201d. The entrances to the nests typically have a diameter of less than 5cm.\nThere are no managed beehives on the estate, which Salbany thinks has played a critical role in the wild bees\u2019 survival, while imported bees from hives nearby are likely to have been deterred from flying to Blenheim to forage by the landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s a closed environment, in terms of bee access, because there are damp and humid valleys which form physical barriers.\u201d\nThe woodlands, which Salbany describes as a paradise of biodiversity, are not open to visitors and no planting or gardening takes place there. \u201cThere\u2019s very little human interaction.\u201d\nThe wild bees seem able to live in balance with the environment and in harmony, not only with each other but with wasps and bumblebees that live in the forest. \u201cFor the 50 honeybee colonies that we have found, we probably have 500 empty sites for them to swarm into. They do not populate every single site: they\u2019ve reached an equilibrium with their environment.\u201d\nRemarkably, he found two colonies of wild bees living within five metres of each other, in a single tree \u2013 right next to a wasps\u2019 nest. \u201cThat is quite unique.\u201d He thinks wasps don\u2019t try to rob the bees because the bees build their nests very high up the trees and make their entrances so small: \u201cThere\u2019s enough forage for the wasps in the forest not to go and bother the honeybees.\u201d\nAs a result, the bees are extremely relaxed and he does not need to wear any protective equipment around them. \u201cI can put my hand in the nest. They are very calm.\u201d Their honey, he said, tastes \u201cincredibly pure\u201d. It is very floral as the bees like to feed on dandelions, blackthorn and sunflowers. \u201cThe smell of it is just extraordinary.\u201d\nHe now suspects there may be other colonies of wild, tree-nesting bees in the UK that have not yet been discovered: another reason, he says, that \u201cwe need to protect our ancient woodlands. Because that\u2019s where we are likely to find these bees.\u201d\nIn total, about 800,000 wild bees have been discovered. Salbany hopes the news will have wide-ranging implications for Britain\u2019s large, imported population of managed honeybees, which can \u201cdecimate the countryside\u201d for native pollinators when they forage. \u201cThis species could be used as stock for beekeepers.\u201d\nDr Rob Stoneman, a director at the Wildlife Trust, said the discovery of the wild bees was \u201cextraordinary\u201d and demonstrated the value of the UK\u2019s ancient woodlands. \u201cThese kinds of stories give us hope and motivation to create a wilder future.\u201d\nWild honeybees are resistant to the varroa mite, a deadly parasite for other bees\nThey can forage in temperatures as low as 4C\nThey\u2019re happy to live near wasps and other honeybee colonies\nThey nest in trees 15 to 20 metres off the ground\nThey live in colonies eight to 10 times smaller than managed beehives\nThey have multiple queens to ensure the colony survives, and the fittest queen rules\nThey\u2019re smaller, darker and furrier than imported honeybees, with smaller wings and more distinct veins.",

        "content": "The likes of BP and Shell promise a \u2018transition\u2019 to green energy backed by their revenues. They need to convince us further\nExecutives at big oil and gas companies, at least the European ones, have spent the past two years trying to change the narrative. The likes of BP and Shell have trumpeted their net zero plans, declared themselves to be \u201ctransitioning\u201d to a cleaner energy future and talked up the historical significance of new targets. Think of us as part of the solution, was the message.\nTo climate activists and politicians demanding faster decarbonisation, the industry\u2019s reply has been that switching off investment in oil and gas too quickly would create a supply crisis: instead what\u2019s needed are \u201cintegrated\u201d energy companies that can recycle cashflows from hydrocarbons and build the green infrastructure of tomorrow.\nAnd, up to a point, the pitch has worked. The heaviest pressure has been directed instead at those industry giants viewed as disengaged laggards or refuseniks. Remember how tiny hedge fund Engine No 1 managed to get transition-minded candidates on to the board at ExxonMobil, while at Chevron, 61% of investors backed a proposal from Dutch campaign group Follow This to force faster cuts in emissions.\nBut a year on from BP and Shell\u2019s big announcements, their boards are mistaken if they think they now have a clear run to 2050 and that it\u2019s just a matter of executing shareholder-backed plans. Trouble is bubbling on at least three fronts.\nFirst, note the absence of oil executives, even the transitioning sort, in formal roles at Cop26 in Glasgow. Executives were confined to side meetings because their net-zero goals aren\u2019t deemed to be science-based. That\u2019s because the measurement methodology doesn\u2019t yet exist, the companies would argue. But they are open to the charge of marking their own homework. Governments or voters may yet conclude that last year\u2019s grand declarations simply don\u2019t go far enough.\nSecond, Shell has been challenged on its integration-is-best thesis. High-profile US hedge fund Third Point says the company has \u201ctoo many competing stakeholders pushing it in too many different directions, resulting in an incoherent, conflicting set of strategies attempting to appease multiple interests but satisfying none\u201d. It suggests an alternative: split Shell into several standalone units and allow the renewables-focused arm to invest more aggressively, backed by a united set of shareholders. The climate would benefit, it argues.\nThat last point is debatable, it should be said. The legacy upstream and refining business wouldn\u2019t necessarily cut capital expenditure, as Third Point assumes. And Shell\u2019s renewables business isn\u2019t yet large and may require years of backing from oil and gas cashflows.\nJessica Uhl, Shell\u2019s chief financial officer, also argued recently that 120 years of accumulated technical expertise in energy is vital for delivering complex technological projects such as integrated carbon capture, biofuels and hydrogen facilities.\nAn activist hedge fund like Third Point primarily just wants, one suspects, a higher share price, but it has ignited a debate. Its argument that \u201csentimental\u201d attachment to a \u201csuper major legacy\u201d results in \u201cincrementalism\u201d may run and run.\nThird \u2013 and far less nuanced \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to miss the vast sums of cash currently being generated by oil companies when a barrel of Brent fetches $85. \u201cWe\u2019re a cash machine at these types of prices,\u201d said BP chief executive Bernard Looney last week, promising investors $1bn-a-quarter share buybacks as long as the price remained above $60.\nAccording to this script, none of the spoils of the unexpected cash bonanza will be redirected towards extra investment in renewables, beyond the increase to $5bn a year by 2030 that BP has already pledged.\nIs that fair? It\u2019s what was agreed with investors, Looney might argue, but that answer would appear very self-satisfied. Expectations change. What sounded like a big strategic reset a year ago feel less impressive today. Even under its own definition of transitioning, big oil can afford to pick up the pace. To properly change the narrative, it should.\nAndrew Bailey went on a media blitz after Thursday\u2019s meeting of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. It wasn\u2019t just the usual short clips either; Threadneedle Street\u2019s governor did a long turn on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the next morning.\nNothing unusual in that, it might be thought. But the Bank normally goes to these lengths only when it has actually done something, whereas Bailey was popping up everywhere to try to explain why he and his colleagues had left policy unchanged. That\u2019s a measure of how bad the Bank\u2019s communications have been.\nAt one point in the press conference announcing the decision to leave interest rates at 0.1%, Bailey said it was \u201cnot our responsibility to steer markets on interest rates\u201d \u2013 a comment that would raise eyebrows at the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB), where managing expectations is part of the job description. What\u2019s more, when Bailey said last month that the Bank would have to act to curb inflationary pressure, it was a clear attempt to steer markets. As it turns out, a rather ham-fisted one.\nNor is anything much clearer now. After surprising the markets by its inaction, the Bank\u2019s current message is that interest rates will need to rise in the coming months \u2013 but only if post-furlough data from the labour market is strong enough to warrant such a move.\nBailey deserves to be cut some slack. He is still relatively new to the job and deciding what to do about interest rates is not easy when the economy is both slowing and being hit by cost increases for the most part beyond the control of the Bank.\nThat said, he needs to study how other bank governors communicate. Mario Draghi, former head of the ECB, was an absolute master at getting his message across. By comparison, Bailey looks a novice.\nTwo months ago, London\u2019s crop of newly floated businesses appeared in fine fettle. In September, THG, Britain\u2019s great e-commerce hope formerly known as The Hut Group, was valued at \u00a38.3bn, while Darktrace, the cybersecurity firm set up by mathematicians and former spies, had a market capitalisation of \u00a37bn. Today, investors value both combined at barely north of \u00a36bn.\nShares in loss-making Manchester-based THG, which runs retail websites such as Lookfantastic and Zavvi, have cratered as investors reassess the prospects of the business model and the level of control held by its leader and 22% shareholder, Matt Moulding. From a high of 800p in January, the shares hit a low of 198p last week, far below last September\u2019s 500p launch price \u2013 at the time the biggest London Stock Exchange debut since Royal Mail in 2013. The gyrations suggest investors are struggling to value tech plays on the capital\u2019s market.\nThe same is true of Darktrace, which floated in April at a conservative 250p, before racing in value from \u00a31.7bn to \u00a37bn. However, a recent critical analysts\u2019 note and fears of a mass sell-off of stock by insiders have seen its share price almost halve.\nWhile the LSE still has some winners \u2013 notably fintech firm Wise, which has held its value since becoming the largest-ever listing of a UK tech company earlier this year, and the stellar debut of biotech firm Oxford Nanopore in September \u2013 there is now caution in the air.\nLast week, industrial products provider Rubix Group canned a planned IPO in London, citing \u201cdifficult ongoing conditions\u201d, having announced the intention to float only last month. Similarly Marley, the biggest producer of roof tiles in Britain, abandoned its \u00a3500m IPO \u2013 blaming \u201cmarket volatility\u201d \u2013 less than three weeks after announcing it.\nAdd the experience of Czech fleet services firm Eurowag, described as the Uber of trucking, which endured a disastrous debut last month, and it would appear that investors fuelling the red-hot IPO market could be leaving London in the cold.",

        "content": "Figures delayed as police and borders bills pass through parliament\nThe Home Office has failed to release its annual stop-and-search data, prompting concern that the figures will reveal a further increase to disproportionate targeting of black people.\nAt the same time, the department is refusing to publish the results of its own public consultation into its heavily criticised \u201canti-refugee\u201d legislation.\nCampaigners said the withholding of key data appeared to be an attempt to avoid negative headlines while the Home Office\u2019s two controversial legislative proposals \u2013 the policing bill and the borders bill \u2013 pass through parliament.\nThe government\u2019s official stop-and-search statistics, covering the year up to April 2021, should have been published last month. The Home Office has failed to do so, saying that the three-week delay is because of a change in the level at which recorded data has been collected, meaning extra time is required to check it and to \u201cresolve data quality issues\u201d.\nCritics believe the real reason is because the statistics show that the use of stop and search that disproportionately affects black communities has widened \u2013 findings that would provoke fresh scrutiny on the policing bill, which seeks to expand the use of the contentious measure at a time when trust in policing is under scrutiny. Black people are already nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people, official figures for England and Wales show.\nEmmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns officer at human rights group Liberty, said: \u201cTransparency over the use and abuse of police powers is critical, yet this government has shown time and time again that it will do anything to evade scrutiny and undermine accountability.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Home Office is refusing to share the results of its own research into what the public think of its nationality and borders bill, which has been heavily criticised and recently was found to breach international and domestic law in at least 10 different ways.\nThe unveiling of the borders bill was preceded by a public consultation asking people to forward their views on its proposals, which include the provision to send asylum seekers overseas. The bill has been described as ruthless and pernicious.\nDespite almost 7,500 responses from the public \u2013 compared to 1,120 stakeholders \u2013 the Home Office is refusing to publish the results, raising questions over what it is trying to hide.\nUsing a Freedom of Information exemption, officials argue that the \u201cbalance of the public interest lies in\u2026 withholding the information\u201d, seeming to overlook that the data is from a public consultation on an issue of widespread national debate. However it did concede: \u201cDisclosing the full reports would increase public awareness of the issues, accountability and transparency.\u201d\nSonya Sceats, chief executive at Freedom from Torture, which submitted the FoI, said: \u201cOpposition to this government\u2019s cruel and law-breaking anti-refugee bill is growing. The Home Office\u2019s refusal to publish findings from its own public consultation begs the question: what exactly has the British public told them that they want to keep hidden from us?\n\u201cIt is an affront to caring people across this country who are horrified by this vicious political agenda designed to distract us from this government\u2019s failing.\u201d\nSceats called on the home secretary, Priti Patel, to release the report, adding that her group has instructed solicitors to draft an internal review into the decision.\nSolicitor Carolin Ott, from law firm Leigh Day, said Freedom from Torture believed \u201cthere are clear and cogent reasons why disclosure of the requested information is essential to allow scrutiny\u201d of the borders bill.\nThe policing bill has also come under recent and sustained criticism, including from former police leaders, with Patel keen to add new protest-related stop-and-search powers.\nAndrews added: \u201cThe government is facing growing opposition to its policing bill, which will expand stop and search in a way it knows will lead to more discrimination, more dangerous interactions with the police for people of colour, especially black men, and will exacerbate the underlying conditions that lead to serious violence. The government must listen to these warnings and scrap the bill before it puts more people in danger.\u201d\nThe Home Office says that the release of the stop-and-search data has been put back to 18 November with the policing bill currently passing through the vital committee stage in the Lords where every clause has to be agreed and votes on any amendments can take place.\nThe unpublished data covers part of the first lockdown when the Metropolitan police increased its most discriminatory form of stop and search \u2013 section 60 \u2013 despite a fall in crime.\nLiberty has warned that plans to ease restrictions on the use of blanket stop-and-search powers would disproportionately affect black people, who are already up to 18 times more likely than white people to be subjected to \u201csuspicionless\u201d stop and search.\nThe government announced in July it will be expanding section 60 powers but so far has not published any evidence to support its decision.\nHabib Kadiri, research and policy manager at StopWatch, said: \u201cThe reason given for delaying the annual stop-and-search dataset implies that a record number of street searches took place in 2020/21. This holds a special irony when you consider that crime levels fell during this period primarily because of lockdown rules that mandated the nation to stay indoors.\n\u201cThe government seems committed to helping the police avoid scrutiny over the effectiveness of their actions while increasing their stop-and-search powers.\u201d\nKatrina Ffrench, founder and director of Unjust-UK, said: \u201cWithout transparency there cannot be proper accountability or scrutiny. Ultimately, police legitimacy will continue to be undermined if the government persists with enacting the bill and ignoring its own data.\u201d\n This article was amended on 10 November 2021. An earlier version quoted the Home Office saying the delay was due to a \u201crecord level\u201d of data. After publication the Home Office explained that when it referred to checking \u201cnew record level\u201d data, it meant that data had been collected for the first time at the level of an individual stop and search record, rather than in aggregate.",

        "content": "Kristen Stewart is note-perfect in this ghostly and inventive vision of Princess Diana fighting for her sanity\nIn 2013, respected German film-maker Oliver Hirschbiegel (director of Downfall) turned the Princess of Wales\u2019s stormy life into a farce with Diana, a tatty soap opera featuring a tilt-headed, big-haired Naomi Watts reciting platitudes lifted wholesale from the pages of Hello! magazine. In stark contrast, Chilean director Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s thematic companion piece to his 2016 hit Jackie offers a bold and somewhat mysterious portrait of a woman searching for her own identity, conjuring \u201ca fable from a true tragedy\u201d that, for all its dramatic invention, feels remarkably truthful. Playing out over three excruciating days at Sandringham \u2013 from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day \u2013 and carried shoulder high by a note-perfect Kristen Stewart, Spencer (the very title of which seems to present a challenge to the House of Windsor) dances between ethereal ghost story, arch social satire and no-holds-barred psychodrama, while remaining at heart a paean to motherhood.\n\u201cKeep Noise to a Minimum: They Can Hear You\u201d reads an ominous sign in the Sandringham kitchens, to which vast amounts of food are delivered in the film\u2019s opening salvo. That this food should be delivered like military supplies merely emphasises its weaponised presence for Diana. From the scales on which festive guests are weighed in and out of Sandringham (a bit of traditional \u201cfun\u201d) to nightmarish feasts where cinematographer Claire Mathon sharply captures the claustrophobia of royal stares, Spencer traps its bulimic subject in a web of royal rituals that strip her of agency and identity.\nEvery move Diana makes is monitored \u2013 by the press, whose lenses are more like microscopes; by the dressers, who sew Diana\u2019s curtains shut as if to preserve some vampiric legacy; and by the Lurch-like Major Alistair Gregory (Timothy Spall), the Queen Mother\u2019s equerry who was once in the Black Watch and who now watches so that \u201cothers do not see\u201d. Meanwhile, Diana\u2019s gowns are labelled \u201cPOW\u201d - Princess of Wales or prisoner of war?\n\u201cPast and present are the same thing,\u201d Diana tells her beloved young sons of this coldly traditional world, in which a secret candlelit cuddle provides a rare moment of warmth, adding (with a hint of Sex Pistols-style anarchy) that in this house there is \u201cno future\u201d. Little surprise that Diana longs to return \u201chome\u201d to nearby Park House, a childhood idyll now sealed off behind barbed wire, eerily shrouded in moonlight and mist like Wuthering Heights. Despite being ordered to stay away, Diana slips her bonds to revisit old haunts in a scene that recalls Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s maternally themed ghost story The Others. There\u2019s a hint of Daphne du Maurier, too, as pearls tumble from Diana\u2019s neck down a flight of stairs, recalling the gothic-inflected screen adaptations of My Cousin Rachel.\nAt times, Steven Knight\u2019s script over-eggs its imagery, not least in a recurrent motif about pheasants being \u201cbeautiful but not very bright\u201d birds bred for shooting or a subplot about Bertie the scarecrow wearing the coat of Diana\u2019s \u201cPapa\u201d. There are also visions of Anne Boleyn, who was beheaded so that her royal husband could replace her with another woman; amid the madness of royal life her presence seems weirdly unintrusive. More affecting is an ecstatic montage in which Stewart dances her way through the chapters of Diana\u2019s life, ballet and bops breaking into a running canter as the whiff of freedom presents itself.\nUnderpinning it all is a magnificent score by Jonny Greenwood that brilliantly accompanies and amplifies the drama. From the lilting motifs of the main theme, with its melancholy major-minor modulations, to the sounds of a baroque string quartet collapsing into jarring terror, or the skittery free-form jazz of Diana\u2019s inner turmoil, the mood changes are remarkable, throwing a touch of Krzysztof Penderecki modernism into the cheeky echoes of Italian baroque composer Tomaso Albinoni.\nIn the supporting roles, Sean Harris is superb as kitchen stalwart Darren, who longs to make something his princess actually wants and who addresses his staff as a \u201cbrigade\u201d heading \u201conce more unto the breach\u201d. Plaudits too to Sally Hawkins who adds a much-needed note of love as Diana\u2019s favoured dresser, Maggie, breathing vibrant life into a role that in other hands could have fallen flat, but which Hawkins gives wings to fly.",

That is only 1% of the 506,916 admitted via A&Es, but it is more than 10 times as many as the 458 waiting more than 12 hours in September 2019 and nearly twice as many as the January peak of 2,847.\nScientists at the Zoe Covid study said last week that UK cases of coronavirus may have peaked. But the React study at Imperial College found that the R number was between 0.9 and 1.1 with Covid cases at their highest levels.\nPressures on hospitals have prompted the Royal College of Nursing to call for a return to compulsory mask-wearing, while Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said that ministers should reimpose a legal obligation to wear masks on public transport, allowing police to enforce the law.\nLast week, Roland Sinker, chief executive of the trust running Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, told his staff that the situation was so serious that it was \u201cceasing to function as a hospital\u201d and that they were \u201cthinking about restricting access to care\u201d. Leeds Teaching hospitals trust also cancelled a large number of planned operations last week because of Covid pressures.\nDr Ian Higginson, RCEM\u2019s vice-president, said that the national picture was grim. \u201cOur staff are still turning up for work and still doing their best to provide the best care they can. But we are in a vicious spiral. We\u2019re seeing more patients than we can cope with.\u201d\nHospitals have seen ambulances queuing outside waiting for patients to be treated, and when they arrive in emergency departments, more are facing long waits for treatment.\n\u201cNow, in some parts of the country, patients are waiting days before they can be admitted to hospital,\u201d Higginson said. \u201cThere are patients in emergency departments for one, two, and in some cases, many more days. And that\u2019s becoming accepted as the norm. It\u2019s totally wrong.\u201d\nDr Susan Crossland, the president of the SAM, said the annual winter crisis affecting the NHS was getting longer and longer.\n\u201cSince Covid, it\u2019s been like one long, eternal winter. Our members are reporting that their trusts are running at over 100% capacity. All the beds that they normally have available are full. Most of the wards that we would normally open in winter are full. And they\u2019re scrabbling around looking for other places.\u201d\nHospital bed occupancy was at 85% for England between April to June, as the second wave of Covid reached its lowest point. Even then, nine hospitals reported that more than 95% of their acute beds were occupied, and the trusts running Leeds and Addenbrooke\u2019s were among a further 34 at above 90% occupancy.\nHigginson said: \u201cCertainly, many of us work in hospitals where occupancy is declared to be much higher than that, and feels much higher than that.\u201d\nDiverting patients from hospital into clinics might relieve some of the pressure, Higginson said. Doctors at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust are about to conduct a trial of new telemedicine \u201crobots\u201d that may speed up diagnoses. The machines will enable several specialists to remotely join a bedside consultation of a patient with complex needs.\nSaffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cWhile staff continue to work extremely hard to address the significant backlog of care, trust leaders across the country are telling us they are under significant pressures, and they are increasingly concerned as we move further into a difficult winter.\u201d\nShe said that rising demand and staff shortages combined with Covid were causing capacity problems, and the NHS had lost 4,500 beds since the pandemic due to infection control measures.\nSocial care problems were \u201chaving a major impact on whether patients can leave hospital in a timely way when they are medically fit to do so\u201d, she added.\nThe government\u2019s decision to end all Covid restrictions on 19 July was criticised at the time by the Royal College of Nursing. Rose Gallagher, the RCN\u2019s professional lead for infection prevention and control, said: \u201cIt was extremely shortsighted of the government to end compulsory public mask-wearing, and they can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned \u2013 it must be reinstated without further delay to prevent avoidable transmission.\u201d\nSadiq Khan said: \u201cWhile most Londoners continue to do the right thing and wear [a mask], it is clear the changes brought in by the government have given passengers mixed signals and affected compliance.\n\u201cThe evidence that face masks can make a substantial contribution towards lower transmission is getting stronger all the time. I continue to urgently lobby ministers to bring back this requirement and enable British Transport Police officers to enforce the wearing of face coverings across all TfL services.\u201d\nCovid cases among 10- to 14-year-olds in England have been the highest of any age group since 9 September, shortly after the start of the autumn term, but began dropping when most schools started half-term on 22 October.\nIn the north London borough of Enfield, cases began falling earlier after some schools took matters into their own hands. St Anne\u2019s Catholic High School for Girls in Palmers Green had seen cases rise sharply, so that by 4 October there were 117 positive cases, according to Emma Loveland, the headteacher.\n\u201cThat was over 10% of our student population,\u201d she said. \u201cThe figures were getting quite scary.\u201d\nLoveland convened a meeting of the school leadership team, and after consultation with Enfield public health team, they decided to introduce three measures.\n\u201cMasks became compulsory again, unless exempt of course, so students wear them in class, in corridors, queuing up \u2013 and staff as well,\u201d she said. They also increased the amount of cleaning, and asked the children and their families to pay much more attention to symptoms.\n\u201cWe saw our cases drop over the following three weeks to 55,\u201d Loveland said. \u201cI don\u2019t think masks in isolation would have changed things, but they were a big part of it. Half-term is always a concern because usually you see a spike, but we haven\u2019t experienced that, and we are now on less than 20 students with Covid.\u201d\nCase rates in Enfield have been on an upward trend over the last three months, according to the government\u2019s dashboard, rising from a seven-day average of 74.1 cases a day on 15 September to 125.7 by 27 October.\nThe highest rates have been among schoolchildren and 40- to 49-year-olds. Among 10-14s, cases peaked at 840 per 100,000 on 8 October but had dropped to 443 by 31 October.\nJim McManus, the acting president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said that although numbers had fallen since half-term, they were likely to rise again. \u201cCases remain at very high levels and are disrupting education and business. We know that the combination of face coverings, ventilation, plus vaccines and testing is the key to keeping numbers low.\n\u201cWhat matters is the action we take \u2013 a combination of measures that directors of public health and schools and workforces are advising people to take. These are not restrictive measures \u2013 they are simple preventative tools that will avoid the need for further restrictions.\u201d\nThe NHS said: \u201cStaff have gone above and beyond over the last year, contending with record levels of A&E attendances, all while treating more than 470,000 seriously ill Covid patients, and this has inevitably lead to increased pressure on emergency departments.\n\u201cThe NHS has set out a 10-point action plan to support hospitals with the significant demand ahead of winter, so anyone who needs the NHS should come forward through the appropriate route so staff can help you with the best option for your care, and it remains as important as ever to get your lifesaving Covid jab and flu jab if you are eligible.\u201d",

        "content": "Artefacts reflect joys and sorrows of a community persecuted in Spain since Catholic reconquest in 1492\nIt doesn\u2019t look like a place of legend, but the narrow Carrer de la Cera is the birthplace of la rumba catalana, the infectiously rhythmic stepchild of flamenco created by Barcelona\u2019s Gypsy community in the 1950s and popular today throughout the world.\nIt is now also home to a Gypsy museum, which opened its doors on Sunday, in the multicultural el Raval neighbourhood that was once the heart of the Barcelona community.\nThe museum is the work of the Gypsy cultural organisation Carabuts\u00ed, a Catalan Gypsy word meaning terrific. Sam Garcia, its president, says the aim is to preserve the memory of the now-disparate community.\nDocuments suggest that there have been Gypsies in Catalonia since the early 15th century and, in common with other Spanish Gypsies, they have long ceased to be itinerant. Most live in large cities, while some have been forced into shantytowns such as the Ca\u00f1ada Real, near Madrid, or the rundown La Mina estate in Barcelona.\n\u201cWe realised there was a really big Gitano population here in el Raval, which is disappearing because of gentrification,\u201d he says. \u201cThree hundred years ago there were 1,500 Gypsies living in this one small street.\u201d\nA group of seven women set about collecting oral histories from elderly residents and accumulated an archive of 7,000 interviews, photographs and documents \u2013 all from the one street \u2013 many of which are on display in the museum while the rest will be available online.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not archivists or anthropologists so it\u2019s been hard to organise all this information,\u201d says Garcia, adding with pride that within a year their work had won them an award from the city council.\nProminent space in the new museum is given to celebrating la rumba catalana, a blend of flamenco, Arab music and Caribbean rhythms. Peret (Pedro Pubill Calaf), the most famous rumbero, performed at the closing ceremony of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The museum will host workshops and study groups and has organised two tourist itineraries, the Carrer de la Cera and the ruta de la rumba catalana.\nThe photographs and artefacts that cover its walls reflect the joys and sorrows of a people who have been persecuted in Spain ever since the Catholic reconquest in 1492, when they were given 60 days to leave the country.\nHostility to Gypsies in Spain is so entrenched that racist comments scarcely raise an eyebrow. When Philip Alston, then the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, visited Spain last year, he was damning about their treatment, citing one \u201csegregated school in a poor neighbourhood with a 100% Roma student body and a 75% rate of early leaving\u201d.\nAlston said an independent, comprehensive review was needed to ensure that Roma children were \u201cnot doomed to repeat the cycle of poverty and exclusion\u201d.\nA 2012 Eurobarometer survey showed that 26% of Spaniards felt \u201ctotally uncomfortable\u201d about their children sharing a classroom with Gypsies.\n\u201cWe have this reputation for being bad, lazy, dirty, thieves and criminals,\u201d says Garcia, who comes from a family of scrap merchants. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dragging around these stereotypes for years. You hear it all the time. If you try to rent an apartment, as soon as they find out you\u2019re a Gypsy, that\u2019s that.\u201d\nAs well as these stereotypes, Gypsies\u2019 resistance to assimilation means they are viewed as outsiders, the \u201cother\u201d, not really part of society, and were not recognised as citizens until 1978.\nThey are even sometimes accused of \u201cauto-exclusion\u201d, the implication being that they have chosen a marginal existence. Not so, says Garcia, who says non-assimilation is a form of resistance.\n\u201cWe resist through the family,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the Catholic kings banned us from speaking our language and broke up families, we knew we had to move on, get together and start again. The family is what protects us. For us, the family is fundamental. That\u2019s why we mostly don\u2019t intermarry, although these days marrying a non-Gypsy is more common and it\u2019s not such a problem.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to educate people about the life of the Gypsies who have been here for 600 years. We hope if people understand our culture better they might see we\u2019re not that different from them.\u201d",

        "content": "Allowing cheaper, paint-only crossings on side roads would encourage pedestrians, polling shows\nMinisters are being urged to allow low-cost, paint-only zebra crossings on side roads to encourage more walking, after research showed they made drivers significantly more likely to stop for pedestrians.\nA study commissioned in Greater Manchester, where the transport commissioner has spent more than two years trying to persuade the Department for Transport (DfT) to approve the idea, found that when the markings were installed, 70% of drivers stopped for people waiting to cross the road, against 40% without them.\nWith parallel polling showing three-quarters of parents would be more likely to walk their primary-aged children to school if such markings were in place, groups including Living Streets, Guide Dogs, the Ramblers and the AA have called for them to be introduced.\nUnder current UK law, zebra crossings are allowed only if they have zigzag markings along the road before and after, and main-wired flashing lights on poles, meaning they cannot be installed at a junction and they cost up to \u00a340,000 each.\nAs part of wider plans to encourage more people to walk and cycle, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and his transport commissioner, the former Olympic and Tour de France cyclist Chris Boardman, have been trying to persuade the DfT to approve the simpler version, as used ubiquitously in many cities around Europe, which cost an estimated \u00a31,000 each.\nThe duo, who hope other UK cities could follow the lead, commissioned the independent Transport Research Laboratory to carry out limited on-street trials in Manchester and London of what are officially termed \u201cnon-prescribed zebras\u201d.\nThese found a significant increase in the proportion of drivers who gave way, although this was lower when drivers were turning into a side road rather than turning out, and that pedestrians were more likely to feel safe to cross.\nBurnham and Boardman, who say they could install hundreds of the crossings in the next 12 months, mainly in lower-traffic residential areas, as part of the region\u2019s new Bee Network for active travel routes, have written to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, seeking his support.\nBurnham said: \u201cEvery year in the UK around 2bn trips under one mile are made by car, the equivalent of a 15-minute walk or a five-minute bike ride. Those trips by car are releasing approximately 680,000 tonnes of carbon. We wanted to see if a method used widely across the world could offer us a practical and cost-effective option to make crossing side roads safer and, importantly, feel safer.\u201d\nIn a joint statement, Living Streets, the AA, British Cycling, Guide Dogs, the Campaign for Better Transport, the Ramblers, Sustrans and Playing Out said: \u201cIn the face of a global climate crisis and worsening obesity and physical inactivity levels, the need to enable millions more people across the nation to make local journeys on foot is not a choice \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute necessity.\n\u201cThe evidence for side-road zebras is compelling, the benefits are overwhelming. It\u2019s time to take a step towards better health; a step towards decarbonation; a safer step in the right direction.\u201d\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the report but will carefully consider its findings before making any further decisions.\u201d",

It\u2019s not thinking outside the box. In the UK, you have crime commissioners and there\u2019s more scope for discretion at the local level with some prepared to push the boundary,\u201d Clark told the Observer.\n\u201cBut to get that consistently across the United Kingdom, you need the Home Office to get off its high horse of oppression and prohibition and say: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve had this wrong, our prisons are thronged with people on drug offences, marginalised swathes of people. It\u2019s costly and self-defeating,\u201d added Clark, whose commission is made up largely of world leaders.\nBy contrast, she praised Scotland for recognising it had problems \u2013 the country has the highest per capita number of deaths relating to drug use in Europe \u2013 and signalling that it wanted to look for new solutions.\n\u201cScotland knows it\u2019s shameful. After the last set of [fatality] figures came out, the Scottish government wants to [make a] move,\u201d said Clark.\nHer comments come just before the inaugural edition of the global drug policy index which ranks countries according to indicators such as health and harm reduction rather than the traditional law enforcement measures of the numbers of arrests or amount of drugs seized.\nAccording to the latest National Crime Agency annual report, more than 150 tonnes of drugs were seized at a time when deaths from drug poisoning in England and Wales have hit a record high, prompting charities to warn of a public health emergency.\nThe index, headed by the International Drug Policy Consortium, a global network of 192 organisations, is intended to question the ambition of achieving a \u201cdrug-free society\u201d, which Clark says is futile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy, the total elimination of drugs? Dream on, there\u2019s never been a time in human history where human beings haven\u2019t resorted to some kind of substances that will take them out of their current reality for whatever reason,\u201d she said.\nThe index arrives 50 years after the UK\u2019s Misuse of Drugs Act came into force, which still forms the basis of its anti-drug strategy \u2013 separating illicit substances into classes which carry different penalties \u2013 but which is facing increasing calls for reform.\nA number of prominent campaigners are pushing for the decriminalisation and regulation of drugs with more than 60 MPs supporting a campaign to review current legislation.\nDespite this, the UK is expected to sit in the top 10 of the index\u2019s most progressive countries when it is launched in London on Monday, a ranking that Clark says articulates the current failures of global drug policy.\nThe index is composed of 75 indicators including criminal justice and extreme responses of the state to the issue. Of the 30 countries featured in its first iteration, eight had decriminalised drug use and just three managed to divert people away from the criminal justice system.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cDrugs damage communities and ruin lives. We must prevent drug use in our communities, support people through treatment and recovery, and tackle the supply of illegal drugs.\u201d\nThey cited Project ADDER, which it said was \u201ctaking a wide-ranging and integrated approach to prevent drug use and support people dependent on drugs through treatment and recovery\u201d.",

Information on who they were investigating and why, as well as details of the FBI\u2019s sources and methods, should remain confidential on grounds that they are \u201cstate secrets\u201d.\nAhilan Arulanantham, a human rights lawyer at UCLA who will be arguing FBI v Fazaga for the plaintiffs on Monday, told reporters that the question for the court was simple: \u201cWill the people we represent ever get their day in court? Are the courts open to protect this community\u2019s religious freedoms, or can the government slam the doors shut whenever it claims to be acting in the name of national security?\u201d\nAt the heart of the case is Craig Monteilh, a fitness instructor convicted for fraud, who was taken on by the FBI as an informant five years after 9/11 in \u201cOperation Flex\u201d in which he surveilled mosques in Irvine, California.\nAli Malik, one of the three plaintiffs in the Fazaga case, vividly remembers when Monteilh first visited the Islamic Center of Irvine in July 2006. The informant presented himself as a person of French and Syrian descent wanting to convert to Islam.\n\u201cHe was not someone you\u2019d forget,\u201d Malik told the Guardian. \u201cPhysically, he\u2019s very dominant\u2013 a big guy, a body builder. He\u2019s massive, shaved head, tattoos \u2013 so he didn\u2019t look like the majority of constituents at the center.\u201d\nMalik, a US citizen from birth, was 22 and a student when Monteilh appeared. Malik said that he and his fellow worshippers were excited to welcome into their community the new convert, who took on the name Farouk al-Aziz.\n\u201cWe had never experienced an undercover provocateur,\u201d Malik said. \u201cWe had no reason to believe that the FBI was involved in that activity. In fact, the FBI had come to our mosque, looked into our eyes, and assured us that they were not spying on us.\u201d\nMalik became Monteilh\u2019s mentor, teaching him how to pray. For more than a year, they met regularly, sharing personal details of their lives and working out at the gym together.\nMalik recalls becoming uneasy about Monteilh when he began asking questions about violent jihad, becoming increasingly incessant on the subject.\n\u201cHe would say, \u2018What about jihad? What about this?\u2019 I had only one response: \u2018Vigilante violence is not okay in Islam. You need to focus on how to pray and how to establish a connection with God.\u2019\u201d\nMalik picked up the same concerns from others in the mosque \u2013 Monteilh was inciting violence among them. \u201cHe was so assertive, and he spoke with such urgency that he was really intimidating.\u201d\nThe last conversation they had was so disturbing that Malik went to the imam of the mosque and told him Monteilh was potentially violent and a danger to the community. Eventually, a restraining order was taken out preventing Monteilh from visiting the mosque.\nIronically, the mosque also informed the FBI about their concerns. The FBI said it would deal with the situation.\nIn 2009 it became public that Monteilh was working for the FBI and had been trying to entrap law-abiding American Muslims with his talk of violent jihad. It emerged that he had gathered hundreds of phone numbers, thousands of email addresses, and hours of video and audio recordings inside mosques, homes and businesses associated with Muslims.\nMonteilh later admitted his role, telling the Guardian in 2012 that his FBI handlers had authorized him to have sex with Muslim women and record their pillow talk. \u201cThey said, if it would enhance the intelligence, to go ahead and have sex. So I did,\u201d he said.\nThat same year, Monteilh told NPR that he told two congregants: \u201cwe should bomb something\u201d.\nMalik joined his co-plaintiffs, Sheikh Yassir Fazaga and Yasser Abdel Rahim, in filing a lawsuit against the FBI. In 2011, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Greater Los Angeles, they filed a federal class-action lawsuit accusing the government of surveilling Muslim Americans in violation of their constitutional rights.\nThe invocation of \u201cstate secrets\u201d in the Fazaga case was the first time in recent American history that the privilege was invoked to dismiss a lawsuit brought by an American citizen concerning domestic law enforcement.\nMonday\u2019s hearing is the second time the supreme court will consider the application of \u201cstate secrets\u201d this term. Last month, the justices considered whether the Guant\u00e1namo detainee Abu Zubaydah should be able to question two former CIA contractors about the brutal torture he was subjected to at a \u201cblack site\u201d in Poland.\nIn the Fazaga case, the nation\u2019s highest court will adjudicate on whether the lawsuit against FBI\u2019s surveillance can proceed under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This would allow the case to be heard in a federal district court with part of the proceedings conducted in private to safeguard sensitive intelligence.\nMalik and his fellow plaintiffs will be in Washington on Monday to listen to the arguments, although they will not be allowed into the courtroom under Covid restrictions. He told the Guardian that the hearing was \u201cprobably the most important thing, other than getting married and having children, in my entire life\u201d.\nHe said the lawsuit boiled down to a simple premise: \u201cCan I practice my religion without having to feel I\u2019m doing anything wrong?\u201d\nAs for the government\u2019s claim of \u201cstate secrets\u201d, Malik said: \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to know that the government can conduct illegal activity against me and that I, as a citizen, can\u2019t hold them to account. All I\u2019m asking for is the establishment of the rule of law \u2013 for the constitution of the United States to be upheld.\u201d",

Less so was some countries\u2019 absence from major initiatives\nIn terms of national carbon pledges, India provided the best news last week, with prime minister Narendra Modi announcing that the country \u2013 currently a major polluter \u2013 intends to generate half its electricity from renewables by 2030 and achieve net zero emission status by 2070.\nMost experts rate the latter target as extremely ambitious and, according to the journal Nature, many suspect it is more likely that India\u2019s plan is to reach net zero only for carbon dioxide by 2070, with other greenhouse gases coming later. Nevertheless, the move is significant and contrasts sharply with the poor emission commitments made to date by Saudi Arabia, the planet\u2019s second-biggest oil producer, and by Russia, its second-biggest gas provider. Much, in short, remains to be done.\nFelling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forest cover, which is vital for absorbing carbon dioxide. Forests are, it\u2019s said, being cleared at a rate of 30 football pitches\u2019 worth a minute. An agreement to call a halt to this staggering level of deforestation \u2013 reached on Tuesday \u2013 was one of the high points of Cop26\u2019s first week. As part of the deal, more than 100 world leaders agreed to reverse deforestation by 2030. Crucially, Brazil \u2013which has cut down huge stretches of the Amazon rainforest in recent years \u2013 was among the signatories. However, observers have pointed out that a previous international agreement, in 2014, failed to slow deforestation in any way. On the other hand, the latest pledge is being backed with some serious money: almost \u00a314bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Some of this money will go to developing countries, to restore damaged land and help tackle wildfires.\nCarbon dioxide may be the principal driver of global warming, but methane is also a potent greenhouse gas, and atmospheric levels have surged over the past decade. The commitment \u2013 by an alliance of more than 90 nations, representing two-thirds of the global economy \u2013 to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% from current levels by 2030 is therefore considered an important, albeit belated, step forward.\n\u201cCutting back on methane emissions is one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming and keep it to 1.5\u00b0C,\u201d said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Methane is emitted from gas and oil wells, pipelines, livestock, and municipal landfill sites, and much of the effort \u2013 to be led by the US \u2013 will involve companies being obliged to plug leaks in more than 3 million miles of pipelines. Significantly however, China, India and Russia have not pledged to cut their methane emissions.\nGreenhouse gases produced by burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change. Weaning the world off coal is considered critical in limiting temperature rises across the planet.\n\u201cI think we can say the end of coal is in sight,\u201d said Alok Sharma, British president of the two-week summit, detailing an agreement to phase out existing coal-fuelled power plants and stop building new ones. Signatories of the non-binding pledge include major banks and, he said \u201c46 countries \u2026 23 of which are making commitments on ending coal for the first time\u201d.\nHowever, the absence of Australia, India, the US and China from the pledge to drop coal has drawn criticism. \u201cThe key point in this underwhelming announcement is that coal is basically allowed to continue as normal for years yet,\u201d said Jamie Peters, director of campaigns at Friends of the Earth.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), the world\u2019s energy watchdog, reacted fairly enthusiastically to the pledges made so far. \u201cNew @IEA analysis shows that fully achieving all net zero pledges to date & the Global Methane Pledge by those who signed it would limit global warming to 1.8C,\u201d the agency\u2019s director, Fatih Birol, wrote on Twitter last Friday. But Selwin Hart, the special adviser to the UN secretary-general on climate action, challenged the assertion. \u201cFatih, I heard your numbers,\u201d he said in Glasgow. \u201cBut based on the nationally determined contributions that have been submitted, the world is on a 2.7 degree pathway \u2013 a catastrophic pathway.\u201d",

        "content": "Once the epitome of cool, the dark and moody look is out of favour among a generation tired of bad news and restrictions\nFrom the classic little black dress to a for ever cool biker jacket, black has long been fashion\u2019s last word in chic. \u201cI love black because it affirms, designs and styles,\u201d Yves Saint Laurent once said. \u201cA woman in a black dress is a pencil stroke.\u201d But, in a post-restriction world, even this stamp of approval has been undermined. Because, in 2021, colour is the new black.\nHarper\u2019s Bazaar ran a feature titled How Gen Z killed basic black in which writer Isabel Slone argued that \u201cutilitarianism has been replaced with a spirit of experimentation\u201d in fashion. Black, such a useful and versatile staple in wardrobes, is the fall guy. \u201cAn all-black wardrobe is no longer shorthand for a mysterious and brooding individual,\u201d wrote Slone. \u201cMore and more, it telegraphs that a person is, well, old-fashioned.\u201d\nThe take-up of colour is widespread. Scroll through any fashionable Instagram feed and you will find influencers dressed in brights ranging from pumpkin orange to primrose yellow, aqua blue, neon pink and grass green, sometimes all in the same outfit. The trend can also be seen in street style and on celebrities \u2013like Rihanna in bright green on a dinner date in New York, and Kim Kardashian in head-to-toe highlighter pink when hosting Saturday Night Live recently. In the 48 hours following Kardashian\u2019s appearance, searches for pink rose 82% on the fashion search platform, Lyst.\nColour is on the catwalk, too. Tagwalk, a fashion search engine which documents catwalk trends, reports that colourblocking at the spring/summer 2022 shows was up 273% compared with the previous year. Gucci\u2019s Love Parade show in LA was a veritable rainbow of pinks, yellows and reds, while Kelly green \u2013 a shade similar to Rihanna\u2019s coat and also found in collections of brands ranging from Rejina Pyo to Bottega Veneta \u2013 has been declared \u201cthe colour of now\u201d by Elle magazine.\nThis shift away from black is partly down to easing of restrictions in most countries. Colour expresses joy and allows its wearer to look dressed up \u2013 an appealing concept after 18 months at home in grey marl sweatpants.\nFashion psychologist Dr Dawnn Karen said that \u201cpeople are dressing for their best life\u201d and this comes with a certain abandon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to layer that clash. \u2018I\u2019m going to put this on, don\u2019t care if it matches\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are receiving that internal validation. We no longer are looking towards others, we\u2019re looking towards ourselves.\u201d\nThe rise of colour in fashion also reflects the celebration of personal style that dominates fashion now, particularly online. Rosanna Falconer, a brand consultant and co-founder of FashMash, is known to her followers on Instagram for brightly coloured outfits.\nShe says fashion\u2019s embrace of colour \u201cstarted with the digital revolution. A pink dress photographed much better for e-commerce than a black one.\u201d But, while screen pixilation means this has been rectified, colour still stands out. \u201cA colourful design conveys so much more in a 10-second TikTok video and might just stop the scrolling and result in a like,\u201d she said.\nWearing colour isn\u2019t just about gaining attention, though. It can be a way to boost your own mood, at a time when uncertainty remains. \u201cPeople are trying to dress themselves happy,\u201d said Karen, \u201cbecause of that uncertainty, that anxiety, that melancholy.\u201d\nFalconer also believes in the power of colour to make its wearer feel better. She says she wears it \u201cas much for the effect it has on those around me as the effect it has on me\u2026 on dull grey autumn days it\u2019s tempting to cocoon away in neutral colours. But I promise, even 10 minutes in a bright colour tricks the mind into a better day.\u201d\nInfluencer Nicole Ocran describes herself as \u201ca pink person\u201d and her Instagram account features yellow, orange and green and lilac. She says black, for her, recalls an older idea of fashion based around rules. \u201cIn the era of fashion that I grew up in, it was definitely associated with like, \u2018this is the only way you can be chic\u2019, and , minimal wardrobes.\u201d Now, she steers away from black: \u201cIt feels a little bit too safe. I\u2019m in this this kind of stage of my life where I want to be more playful.\u201d",

        "content": "Police sent patrols to stop people around The Marathon Clothing store, records show, as Hussle\u2019s brother tells the Guardian: \u2018Everybody would get harassed\u2019\nThe Los Angeles police department targeted the late rapper Nipsey Hussle\u2019s street corner and his The Marathon Clothing store before his death in 2019, labeling the intersection a \u201chot spot\u201d for crime and sending special patrols that stopped and questioned people in the area, according to records reviewed by the Guardian.\nHussle, whose name became synonymous with the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue, spent years investing in projects in the area until he was fatally shot at the intersection in March 2019. City leaders publicly mourned the artist and entrepreneur, but it was revealed soon after his death that LA law enforcement leaders had been quietly targeting his businesses with a criminal investigation, alleging it was a site of gang activity.\nInternal records obtained by the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition and shared with the Guardian shed new light on how LAPD invested resources into policing at Crenshaw and Slauson, suggesting that for years the department focused enforcement efforts around the community gathering spot where Hussle had bought commercial space and was working to redevelop a corner strip mall.\nThe files, which were acquired through public records requests, are part of the coalition\u2019s new report on \u201cdata-driven\u201d LAPD initiatives that will be released on Monday. The report scrutinizes a controversial and now-shuttered LAPD program called Operation Laser (an acronym for Los Angeles Strategic Extraction and Restoration), which aimed to prevent crime and \u201crestore peace\u201d.\nLaunched in 2011, the program purported to use data to identify \u201cchronic offenders\u201d and specific locations linked to gun violence and gangs, in an effort to \u201cextract\u201d criminal activity from communities. But critics said the initiative was ineffective and biased, and that it enabled surveillance, racial profiling and harassment of Black and Latino residents, with little oversight. In the face of backlash, LAPD discontinued Laser in 2019, acknowledged its results had been \u201cinconsistent\u201d.\nSamiel Asghedom, Hussle\u2019s brother and business partner, told the Guardian he did not know of Operation Laser, but was not surprised to learn that the initiative focused on their store and the surrounding plaza: \u201cIt was a target point \u2026 It was like everybody walking out of the shop would get harassed or arrested.\u201d\nThe full extent of the operation targeting Hussle and his businesses is unclear. Hussle had raised questions about the department\u2019s activities in his community long before the start of the program \u2013 in a 2013 interview, he said officers would regularly stop and question people, and collect their information for no reason.\nBut it appears that LAPD first brought the Laser program to Crenshaw and surrounding neighborhoods in 2015, identifying six \u201czones\u201d of interest (corridors that allegedly had high crime rates). Within those zones, LAPD selected specific locations to target, known as \u201canchor points\u201d.\nThe Crenshaw and Slauson location was marked as an anchor point in 2016, one of about five locations targeted in the district. (By 2019, before the program was shuttered, the city had roughly 70 anchor points across LA, which included businesses, homeless encampments, parks, sidewalks and train stations.)\nHussle, who was 33 when he died, had deep ties to the plaza. \u201cAge 14 on up \u2013 my whole life took place on these four corners,\u201d he said of the intersection in an interview in 2010.\nThe artist and entrepreneur spoke openly about gang culture in the neighborhood and being a part of the Rollin\u2019 60s, a local Crips gang, at a young age. He also said he wanted to invest in economic opportunities for his community, with projects led by locals, instead of allowing outside groups to gentrify his neighborhood. Throughout the years, Hussle and his brother ran several stores on the corner, including an apparel store called Slauson Tees, which opened in 2006.\nHussle opened The Marathon Clothing store in 2017, with a launch event on 17 June. In the days after the grand opening, LAPD intensified its presence on the block, the internal records suggest.\nA \u201cpatrol mission report\u201d from 21-27 June suggests that officers were deployed to the \u201canchor point\u201d at Hussle\u2019s intersection in a crime \u201csuppression\u201d effort. During that week at the location and surrounding blocks, LAPD recorded 58 stops, but made only seven arrests, suggesting that for the vast majority of people stopped or detained, there was no probable cause to arrest them.\nIn a mission the following week, LAPD stopped 103 people, and made only three arrests; the records say LAPD was looking for a robbery suspect described only as a Black male between 16 and 18 years old.\nThe stops could carry serious consequences, even without arrest. As part of the Laser program, officers would routinely fill out \u201cfield interview cards\u201d for civilians they questioned, even if they weren\u2019t taken to jail, and would put their information into LAPD databases, which could later be used against them. Police across the city have allegedly used the cards to falsely label people as gang members and to collect their social media information.\n\u201cLAPD was speculatively criminalizing the location,\u201d said Shakeer Rahman, a Stop LAPD Spying organizer and lawyer. The data that the officers collected could then be used to justify further targeting, he added: \u201cPolice are deployed to these locations, armed with what they\u2019re told are these \u2018data-driven trends\u2019 \u2026 but those trends are just the racial profiling that police have always done.\u201d\nIn one 2016 paper, the architect of the Laser program explicitly argued that LA crime data showed how certain violent crimes were \u201cmore likely to be located in areas where there is a higher percentage of African-American residents\u201d.\nAsghedom said LAPD had frequently harassed his family and passersby at the plaza in the years leading up to the 2017 launch, at one point arresting him while he was working at one of his shops on his birthday for a probation violation. But the police activity escalated dramatically after The Marathon Clothing launch, he said.\n\u201cIt was like every ten minutes a [police] car is coming through the lot, and officers are hopping out. It was nonstop,\u201d he said. In one instance, LAPD even stopped and questioned shoppers who appeared to be tourists, he said. The shoppers turned out to be off-duty police officers from out of state.\n\u201cIt became, \u2018Don\u2019t come here if you don\u2019t want police contact.\u2019 If you did have a warrant, you ain\u2019t coming to buy nothing from us. It was like, \u2018Shit, I\u2019m gonna get pulled over. I\u2019m gonna get targeted,\u2019\u201d he said.\nAsghedom said it felt as if the LAPD officers were angry about the success of the store, which was a source of pride for the local community and drew fans and supporters from across the US: \u201cWe\u2019re here every day selling clothes, so there is less crime. This is something that y\u2019all should be happy about. But instead, their whole goal was just to shut it down.\u201d\nOperation Laser\u2019s focus on Crenshaw and Slauson appeared to continue for years, with one October 2018 map included in the records specifying the Marathon store among a group of addresses as an ongoing anchor point.\nThe Stop LAPD Spying report also raises fresh questions about Los Angeles\u2019 efforts to evict Hussle and his brother from the plaza.\nAfter Hussle\u2019s death, the New York Times uncovered that the city had been targeting his store as a \u201cnuisance\u201d property and the site of alleged gang activity, pressuring the landlord to evict the rapper and his business partners.\nLA\u2019s \u201cnuisance abatement\u201d program allows the city to file evictions based on alleged criminal activity at a property, and records show that the city considered evictions a key \u201cstrategy\u201d to address issues with Laser anchor points.\nEmails reviewed by the group also suggest that some city law enforcement officials had communications with developers in South Central and other parts of the city about eviction and enforcement efforts. The emails, the report\u2019s authors argue, show that data-driven policing programs target areas with growing interest from real estate developers and have accelerated gentrification and displacement there.\nAsghedom said that he and his brother had worked hard to make the corner of Crenshaw and Slauson a positive force in the neighborhood, and he argued that their shops had helped reduce crime in the neighborhood, not perpetuate it. Their landlord supported them, he said: \u201cHe was making money. We were making improvements to the lot. He tried to voice that to the police, and they didn\u2019t give a fuck about none of it. They said, \u2018We\u2019re trying to label this as a city \u2018nuisance\u2019, and if you don\u2019t sever their lease, we\u2019re going to seize the lot from you.\u2019\u201d\nInstead of evicting them, the landlord sold the property to Hussle and his business partners, which they considered a huge accomplishment, Asghedom said.\nBut even after Hussle\u2019s death, the city continued to target the shop with a \u201cnuisance\u201d case, Asghedom said.\n\u201cIt felt like a cat and mouse game. Their agenda was, \u2018Whatever they are doing over there, crush it, stop it,\u2019\u201d said Asghedom.\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent that data collected through Laser may have been used to target The Marathon store for eviction in the final year of his life. The city attorney\u2019s office, which was pursuing the eviction, declined to comment.\nOver the years, they had serious discussions about whether to move the shop elsewhere, where they might face less police harassment. But ultimately, Asghedom said, his brother refused to leave Crenshaw and Slauson.\nAsghedom said he and the other business partners eventually decided to temporarily close down the plaza, so that the city could no longer claim it was a \u201cnuisance\u201d. In the future, he hopes to reopen the Steve\u2019s Barber Shop at the location, to give free haircuts to youth, and to launch a youth center there, along with some kind of museum or gathering spot where fans can pay tribute to his brother.\n\u201cNip wanted to stay in the area and inspire the youth, and we want people to know this is something that Nip bought, knowing where Nip started and where Nip took it to.\u201d\nLAPD declined to respond to repeated requests for comment about the Laser program and the Marathon store.\nOperation Laser\u2019s reach in South Central went far beyond The Marathon Clothing. The Stop LAPD Spying report documents incidents of police violence that occurred in Laser \u201czones\u201d, arguing that these surveillance and \u201cextraction\u201d tactics can be deadly.\nKeith Bursey Jr, 31, was killed by an LAPD officer on Slauson Avenue, a block away from Crenshaw, on 10 June 2016. Officials said LAPD was in the area because 10 June was \u201cHood Day\u201d when \u201cgang members celebrate their gang\u201d. Bursey was a passenger in a car that LAPD approached in a parking lot to investigate the \u201codor of marijuana\u201d. Officers ordered the passengers to exit, and shot Bursey, hitting him in the back when he tried to flee, officials said.\n\u201cIt seems like they were stopping anybody for any infraction that day,\u201d said Cliff Dorsey, Bursey\u2019s cousin, to the Guardian. Dorsey, a South Central native, who now works as a public defender, said he wasn\u2019t familiar with Operation Laser, but that it aligned with the experiences of people in his neighborhood where LAPD gang operations rely on \u201cguilt by association\u201d.\nLAPD frequently labeled South Central natives as criminal gang members based on their families and upbringing, Dorsey said. Bursey was not ashamed of his ties to the Rollin\u2019 60s, which family members had been a part of, but the gang did not define him and did not mean he was a criminal, Dorsey said: \u201cIt can be like family. These are young men that grew up in the same circumstances, surrounded by the same poverty, the same drugs. And they\u2019re trying to survive as best they can.\u201d\nMary Williams, Bursey\u2019s grandmother who raised him, said her grandson was a talented tap dancer and football player and lamented that police stopped him that day \u201cfor no reason\u201d. \u201cThey can\u2019t just go around, harassing people and putting their names in databases. It was such an unnecessary murder.\u201d She said that two weeks after the killing, one of Keith\u2019s cousins was also stopped at the same intersection, without justification, and eventually released.\nLAPD\u2019s \u201cdata-driven\u201d missions also targeted the Crenshaw mall, just north of Hussle\u2019s store, which was labeled a Laser zone in 2015.\n\u201cThis is a mall frequented by Black and brown people,\u201d said Quintus Moore, whose son, Grechario Mack, was killed by police inside the mall in 2018 while suffering a mental health crisis. His son was holding a knife, but witnesses said he wasn\u2019t threatening, and the police commission later ruled that officers violated policy when they shot him.\nMoore said it seemed that the LAPD was often bringing new tactics and programs to his community and the area around the Crenshaw mall \u201cbecause they want to try out their new gadgets and weapons in the Black neighborhood\u201d.\nWhile LAPD has launched efforts over the last decade aimed at improving community relations in South Central, Moore said it felt as if little had changed.\nHe said he had been unjustly pulled over twice while driving in the area in recent years \u2013 once when an officer peered into his car, and another time when an officer asked him if he had tattoos. Both times, after short interactions, he was released.\nJohana Bhuiyan contributed reporting",

        "content": "David Owen condemns Cabinet Office\u2019s \u2018waste of public money\u2019 in four-year bid to stop part of archive\u2019s release\nThe Cabinet Office has been accused of a \u201cgrotesque abuse\u201d of public funds in a freedom of information battle over the personal diaries of Lord and Lady Mountbatten in which costs are now expected to exceed \u00a3600,000.\nAndrew Lownie, the author and historian, has fought a four-year legal battle over the papers that are in an archive saved for the nation after a fundraising campaign. They are now held at Southampton University.\nThe university initially blocked the release of the diaries and correspondence between the Mountbattens covering historical events from the abdication of Edward VIII to the independence of India, after seeking advice from the Cabinet Office.\nLownie, author of a 2019 biography of the Mountbattens, has successfully forced the release of the vast bulk of papers. The Cabinet Office and the university are still fighting Lownie in an information tribunal over the material not yet released.\nLownie\u2019s legal costs for the case and an appeal hearing due to be heard next week are now at about \u00a3350,000. His legal team says a \u201cconservative estimate\u201d for the total legal costs for the Cabinet Office, university and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is \u00a3300,000.\nLord David Owen, the former foreign secretary who has left his own archive of papers to Liverpool University, said: \u201cThis has been a grotesque abuse of public money. It\u2019s an absolutely disgraceful interference by the government and Mr Lownie should be paid back his costs.\u201d\nMountbatten, who was born to the German Battenberg family, became one of the most trusted advisers to the royal family and was a mentor to Prince Charles. He and his wife, Edwina, were influential figures in London society in the 1920s, mixing with the royal family and Hollywood stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Fred Astaire. They both had affairs during their marriage and their personal lives were described as \u201cmessy and complex\u201d.\nMountbatten served as the last viceroy in India. Edwina struck up a close friendship with Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India, and there was speculation they had an affair.\nMountbatten was chief of the defence staff, head of the armed forces in Britain, from 1959 to 1965. He was assassinated in August 1979 by a bomb planted on his fishing boat in County Sligo, Ireland.\nLownie, who is raising funds for the case on the legal funding website CrowdJustice, said: \u201cThese diaries and the correspondence contain fantastic detail and are a unique and invaluable insight into some of the most significant historical events of the last century.\n\u201cThe government and the university have gone from a position where nothing could be released to where almost everything can be released. We want to try and recover our costs, but they still haven\u2019t admitted the game is up.\u201d\nThe diaries covering the period from 1920 to 1968 are part of a larger collection of 4,500 boxes of documents and photographs, known as the Broadlands Archives, which were kept for years at the Mountbattens\u2019 Hampshire estate. They include the papers of the 19th-century prime minister Lord Henry Palmerston and 1,200 letters from Queen Victoria.\nThe documents were moved on loan to Southampton University in 1989 through an agreement with Trustees of the Broadlands Archive, a Mountbatten family trust. The trustees subsequently decided to sell the archive and they were saved for the nation in 2011 with a \u00a32m grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.\nLownie requested access to the Mountbattens\u2019 diaries and correspondence in 2017, but was told the papers were sealed on advice from the Cabinet Office. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office ruled in December 2019 that the documents should be released, but the university, supported by the government, appealed.\nRupert Earle, a partner at legal firm Bates Wells who is acting for Lownie, said: \u201cThe documents were transferred to the university on the basis they would be open to the public, but the Cabinet Office has a default setting of secrecy. It has been an outrageous waste of public money.\u201d\nThe Cabinet Office has recently faced criticism over its response to freedom of information requests. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office says it is the most complained about public authority in relation to the legislation.\nThe Cabinet Office said it is not appropriate to comment during legal proceedings, but has said in parliamentary response that Mountbatten accepted his diaries should not be disclosed without first being vetted. Officials are still deciding whether to release details of the government\u2019s legal costs.\nA Southampton University spokesperson said: \u201c99.8% of the Broadlands Archives, which consist of 4,500 boxes, is publicly available and accessed regularly by researchers globally as an invaluable historic resource.\n\u201c We were directed [in 2011] to keep a small number of the papers closed until otherwise advised.\u201d\n This article was amended on 8 November 2021. The main photo of the Mountbattens had been flipped when supplied by the agency. It is now the right way around.",

The question is the title of a poem by Adrienne Rich, and in Will Tuckett\u2019s new chamber ballet Then or Now for Ballet Black, it finds a quiet but spellbinding response. Rich\u2019s own poems, voiced by various actors, form one strand of the piece, their sparse lines ranging freely between sweeping generality \u2013 war, individualism, love \u2013 and concrete immediacy: coffee at breakfast, a paper plane, a cheek pressed to a window. Rather than illustrate or interpret the words, Tuckett\u2019s staging becomes itself a kind of poetry, an anthology of scenes for eight dancers, voiceover and violin that works through suggestion rather than statement, and lets form give shape to feeling.\nSome scenes are clearly based on Rich\u2019s words. A poem on \u201csending love\u201d is transposed into sweet, swift action as a nugget of imaginary energy \u2013 love \u2013 ricochets among the dancers, variously slow, high, straight or curved. More often, the choreography ties itself more loosely or more fleetingly to the words, the dancers passing in ragged flight as \u201cdark birds of history\u201d, for example. Or it makes its own poetics, letting its images dissolve into measured phrases of motion, shaped by limbs, weight and placement, and framed by the slow, wide steps of its violin score.\nFor all its beauties, its intimacy of scale, its sublimation of drama into composition, the work feels founded on big, urgent themes of war and love \u2013 that is, conflict and connection. Tuckett has placed an unexpectedly gentle finger on the unsteady pulse of our times.\nMthuthuzeli November\u2019s The Waiting Game follows a more familiar dance-drama approach. Its three scenes hinge, somewhat precariously, on the image of a movable door. November starts crouched and cowed, tormented by voices in his head reciting his wake-work-eat-sleep routine while otherworldly pierrot-like figures emerge through the doorway, like sinister unseen forces. In the second scene, Sayaka Ichikawa comes through, coaxing him out of his ennui with impish games of pluck and peck. Finally, he makes it through the door, and finds himself in a land of showtime, glitter-coated with backing dancers, boogieing to Etta James. As dance, it\u2019s a fun finish; as drama, quite a long shot.\nBallet Black is at Festival theatre, Edinburgh, on 18 November. A film adaptation of this double bill will be streamed online, 22-28 November.",

What they are saying to us is they\u2019ve never been so worried,\u201d Chris Hopson told Times Radio on Sunday.\n\u201cThe accident and emergency pathway is very, very busy. So at a point when our staff are really exhausted, it is very worrying. The bit that\u2019s particularly worrying is \u2026 if you look at acute hospitals, where effectively you look at bed occupancy, which is a very good measure of how busy a hospital is, we\u2019re seeing bed occupancy levels, it\u2019s sort of 94, 95, 96% at this point, before we\u2019re into peak winter. We\u2019ve not seen that before. That\u2019s unprecedented. So, there\u2019s a real sense that the NHS is going to be under real pressure.\u201d\nThe NHS faces a surge in admissions every winter as the colder weather drives up respiratory infections, exacerbates heart problems and in severe conditions causes a steep rise in accidents. But pressure on the health service tends to rise through December and reach a peak early the following year.\nWhile coronavirus cases are falling in the UK, it is unclear whether the epidemic has peaked for the year or whether infections will surge again now that schools have returned after half-term and people start to mix more indoors. Covid rates may have peaked in secondary school children but have been rising in older, more vulnerable age groups, driving an increase in deaths through October.\nBeyond concerns about bed capacity, Hopson said he was \u201cvery worried\u201d about the move to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS staff from April. He said there was an obvious risk of infected staff passing the virus on to colleagues, patients and visitors and recognised the logic behind mandatory Covid shots, but said there were risks with the approach.\n\u201cThe bit that\u2019s absolutely vital, and we have seen this in social care, is that if we get this wrong then what will happen is we risk a significant loss of a significant number of staff, just at the point when we cannot afford to lose those staff,\u201d he said.\nMatt Hancock, however, has called on ministers to bring in legislation requiring all NHS workers to receive a coronavirus vaccination before winter.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph on Monday, the former health secretary said: \u201cHaving looked at all the evidence, I am convinced we must require vaccination for everyone who works not just in social care, but the NHS \u2013 and get it in place as fast as possible.\u201d\nSpeaking on BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the UK Health Security Agency\u2019s Dr Susan Hopkins said that while new cases peaked on 18 October, infections could remain at a \u201cvery, very high level\u201d, meaning there would be more deaths that could have been prevented with vaccination.\n\u201cThe people who are dying are the same people who have died all the way through,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is particularly the older age groups, so the over-70s in particular, but also those who are clinically vulnerable, extremely vulnerable, and have underlying medical conditions.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve mentioned, the immune effects wane and what we see is, especially in the older or the vulnerable groups, those are the people whose immunity will wane the most. So, if you\u2019re a healthy 30-year-old, then two doses will protect you for a longer period. That\u2019s why those people need to come forward for their third dose as soon as possible.\u201d",

        "content": "A decade on from psychologist Steven Pinker\u2019s declaration that violence is declining, historians show no sign of agreeing a truce\nTen years ago, the psychologist Steven Pinker published The Better Angels of Our Nature, in which he argued that violence in almost all its forms \u2013 including war \u2013 was declining. The book was ecstatically received in many quarters, but then came the backlash, which shows no signs of abating. In September, 17 historians published a riposte to Pinker, suitably entitled The Darker Angels of Our Nature, in which they attacked his \u201cfake history\u201d to \u201cdebunk the myth of non-violent modernity\u201d. Some may see this as a storm in an intellectual teacup, but the central question \u2013 can we learn anything about the future of warfare from the ancient past? \u2013 remains an important one.\nPinker thought we could and he supported his claim of a long decline with data stretching thousands of years back into prehistory. But among his critics are those who say that warfare between modern nation states, which are only a few hundred years old, has nothing in common with conflict before that time, and therefore it\u2019s too soon to say if the supposed \u201clong peace\u201d we\u2019ve been enjoying since the end of the second world war is a blip or a sustained trend.\nIn 2018, for example, computer scientist Aaron Clauset of the University of Colorado Boulder crunched data on wars fought between 1823 and 2003 and concluded that we\u2019d have to wait at least another century to find out. Clauset doesn\u2019t think it would help to add older data into the mix; indeed, he thinks it would muddy the picture.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to researchers who study sub-state-level violence to substantiate their claims that the dynamics of such violence are relevant to the dynamics of war and, in my view, they haven\u2019t done a great job there,\u201d he says.\nMost researchers accept that there is a difference between war and interpersonal violence \u2013 and that these two things are governed by different forces \u2013 but there is disagreement over where to draw the line between them. Historian and archaeologist Ian Morris of Stanford University, author of War! What Is it Good For? (2014), is among those who say that the nature of collective violence hasn\u2019t changed much in millennia, it\u2019s just that human groups were smaller in the past. For him, therefore, a massacre of a couple of dozen of hunter-gatherers in Sudan around about 13,000 years ago, the earliest known example of collective violence, is relevant to a discussion of modern warfare.\nArchaeologist Detlef Gronenborn of the R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum in Mainz, Germany, agrees. In 2015, he and others described a massacre among Europe\u2019s earliest farmers at a place called Sch\u00f6neck-Kilianst\u00e4dten in Germany, about 7,000 years ago. More than two dozen individuals were killed by blunt force instruments or arrows and dumped in a mass grave, their lower legs having been systematically broken either just before or just after death. The absence of young women from the group suggested that the attackers may have kidnapped them. Gronenborn says that massacres of entire communities were frequent occurrences in Europe at that time and that one of their hallmarks, judging by the human remains, was the desire to erase the victims\u2019 identity. \u201cThe only difference between then and now is that of scale,\u201d he says.\nBut while some researchers may agree with Pinker that prehistoric and modern warfare are essentially the same phenomenon, they don\u2019t necessarily agree with him that the evidence points to a long-term decline. Pinker based his claim that prehistory was extremely violent on around 20 archaeological sites spanning 14,000 years. Those sites unequivocally attest to ancient violence, says historian Dag Lindstr\u00f6m of Uppsala University in Sweden, \u201cbut they cannot be used for quantitative comparative conclusions\u201d. We simply have no way of knowing how representative they were.\n\u201cThe further you go back in time, the more difficult it becomes to have an accurate assessment of how many people died in battle,\u201d says historian Philip Dwyer of the University of Newcastle in Australia, who co-edited The Darker Angels of Our Nature. Civilian death counts are even less reliable, he says, and have likely been significantly underestimated throughout history. In Dwyer\u2019s view, all war-related statistics are suspect, undermining attempts to identify long-term trends.\nOthers think the statistics can be informative. Gronenborn\u2019s work is feeding into larger scale efforts to identify and explain patterns in collective violence. One such effort is the Historical Peace Index (HPI), a collaboration between Oxford University and the group behind Seshat: Global History Databank \u2013 a scientific research project of the nonprofit Evolution Institute \u2013 to map warfare globally over the past 5,000 years. Their goal, as the name suggests, is to try to understand the causes and consequences of war, with a view to building more peaceful and stable societies.\nThe argument of those taking this kind of approach is that the more data you gather, the more you can identify meaningful patterns. Gronenborn, for example, says that it is beginning to look as if collective violence was cyclical in neolithic Europe. One hypothesis he and others are testing is that mounting internal social tensions fuelled explosions of violence, with external shocks such as climate fluctuations acting as triggers.\nThe awkward truth is that collective violence has been one way in which societies have reorganised themselves to become more humane and prosperous. But as societies changed, so did the reasons they went to war.\n\u201cPeople always want to know: what was the earliest war?\u201d says bioarchaeologist Linda Fibiger of Edinburgh University. \u201cBut it would be more interesting to ask: how did neolithic people define violence? What was their concept of war?\u201d\nAny debate over the decline \u2013 or not \u2013 of war must take into account its changing nature, Dwyer says, adding that it didn\u2019t stop changing 200 years ago. In the decades since the second world war, for example, major international conflicts have become less frequent, but small wars have proliferated. This has happened, argues Yale University historian Samuel Moyn in his new book, Humane, in part because over the 20th century the justification for war shifted to peacekeeping and the defence of human rights, ensuring that war shrank in scale but became \u201cfor ever\u201d.\nThe trouble with small-scale wars, as Clauset and others have found, is that they have a strong tendency to escalate, especially if they go on for a long time. In 2019, political scientist Bear Braumoeller of Ohio State University published Only the Dead, in which he argued that the risk of escalation today was as high as it had been when European leaders sent their troops to war in the summer of 1914, believing they would be home by Christmas.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the propensity of war to spiral out of control and produce mind-boggling death tolls, we live in the same world that they lived in,\u201d he wrote.\nWhy war escalates so easily is not well understood, but Braumoeller says it\u2019s a \u201cgood bet\u201d that technology is a factor. Scientist Peter Turchin of the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna, one of Seshat\u2019s co-founders, agrees. He says that stepwise advances in military technology \u2013 he calls them \u201cmilitary revolutions\u201d \u2013 may have been major drivers of collective violence.\nThe military revolution, singular, is the term historians use to describe the period of rapid technological and social change that began in the 16th century with the advent of portable firearms. But Turchin says there were others. One of the most important got under way about 3,000 years ago, across a swath of Eurasia south of the steppes, when archers armed with iron-tipped arrows first mounted horses.\nEach time, the technology handed an advantage to those who had it, stimulating a technological and eventually social arms race. And that technology wasn\u2019t even necessarily devised for military ends. The farming revolution, which ushered in the neolithic period, was also a military revolution, because the advances that gave farmers new tools also gave them new weapons. And some have argued that war became more lethal in the early 1800s in part because of the newfound ease of moving troops and supplies by rail.\n\u201cThe upshot was that, with more soldiers on a given battlefield, it took more deaths on both sides to win a battle and therefore more deaths to win a war,\u201d Braumoeller says.\nMany people perceive technological change to be accelerating. The 20th century saw at least one military revolution, as a result of which we have nuclear weapons and the capacity to wage war in space. The early nuclear weapons were so destructive and so bad at hitting targets that they acted as effective deterrents and helped usher in this current period of stability, Morris says, but counterintuitively, we may have more grounds to worry now that they are generally smaller and more precise.\nMorris sees parallels between the period we\u2019re living through now and the late 19th century, when international conflicts were few, but small-scale insurgencies and civil wars proliferated, and some of them, such as the Boer war, spiralled out of control. That long peace was finally shattered in 1914 and this one will be eventually too, he thinks.\nWhat the cause and who the belligerent parties will be in the war that breaks the peace is not yet possible to say of course, though there has been much speculation \u2013 for example that it may involve Chinese military action against Taiwan. Nevertheless, for those who believe that the past can be instructive about the present, just not in the way Pinker does, Better Angels recalls a slew of books published on the eve of the first world war that proclaimed that war between the great powers was a thing of the past.",

But when both were lost in similar style \u2013 subdued batting performances and unconvincing bowling displays (they took just two wickets in their first two matches combined) following a lost toss \u2013 India stood on the brink of elimination with their tournament only just begun.\nA full week between games stretched the patience of players who, having gone into the World Cup straight from the Indian Premier League, had by then been living in biosecure bubbles for months. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long break for us,\u201d Virat Kohli said before their second match, against New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of time waiting and just doing nothing, really, for us as a team.\u201d\nPakistan sealed top spot in Group 2 and booked a semi-final against Australia with an emphatic 72-run victory over Scotland in Sharjah.\nShoaib Malik set a new Pakistan record for the fastest T20 half-century off just 18 balls, equalling the tournament record set by India's KL Rahul against Scotland on Friday. Malik's unbeaten 54 plus Babar Azam's 66 from 47 balls helped Pakistan add 114 runs in the last eight overs to finish on 189 for four.\nScotland showed little inclination to chase down their target in a strange innings, completing their 20 overs but making only 117 for six. Shadab Khan was impressive for Pakistan, with the leg-spinner taking two for 14 in four overs. Richie Berrington finished unbeaten on 54 from 36 balls as Scotland ended their tournament with a fifth Super 12s defeat.\nBy the second Sunday of the Super 12s the group\u2019s three strongest teams had all played each other, Pakistan winning twice, New Zealand once and India not at all. Though Afghanistan had the potential, ultimately unfulfilled, to upset any of them, the remainder of the matches became a procession. In particular the two teams who qualified from the first group stage, Scotland and Namibia, had realised their ambitions simply by getting that far and, once there, proved hopelessly uncompetitive.\nIndia would of course have been more comfortable if they had hosted the tournament as planned but conditions in the United Arab Emirates are very familiar to players who had all been involved in the IPL, which has been held in the same venues in one and a half of the past two seasons. But India\u2019s internationals are banned from competing in foreign T20 competitions and, despite hosting the most popular domestic tournament of all, internationally it seemed the game had moved on without them noticing.\nThough cricket is the second most popular sport in New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, and the most popular in India, a country of 1.4 billion, the Kiwis have beaten India in the semi-finals of the 2019 50-over World Cup, in the World Test Championship final this year, and have now now eliminated them from the T20 World Cup.\nNeeding to win their last group game to secure qualification, they limited Afghanistan to 124 for eight, Trent Boult and Adam Milne outstanding with the ball, before comfortably reaching their target with 11 balls and eight wickets to spare. They will now face an injury-depleted England in the first semi-final in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, with Pakistan playing Australia in Dubai a day later.",

We are on top of one of the most important sites of Anglo-Saxon history anywhere in this country.\u201d\nFerguson is standing in a field telling the story of one of the last century\u2019s most remarkable archaeological finds. It is here, and in the nearby market town of Wooler, that he and his family are spearheading the development of a \u00a310.4m tourist attraction, one that aims to be the Sutton Hoo of the north.\nAd Gefrin \u2013 \u201cnear the hill of goats\u201d \u2013 was discovered in the 1950s by a team led by archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor. It is a site that includes a complex of timber halls, including the vast Great Hall and a unique wooden grandstand which formed the royal summer palace of seventh-century Northumbrian kings and queens.\nWhile arguably as important as the Sutton Hoo finds of the 1930s, it did not have the glamour. There was no buried ship or fabulous helmet, so it has not resonated in the public consciousness in the same way, says Ferguson.\nBut it should. \u201cNow it feels like a very idyllic rural backwater, but in the seventh century it was one of the most important sites in Britain.\u201d\nAd Gefrin was the summer home of the kings \u00c6thelfrith and Edwin and his queen consort, \u00c6thelburga, as well as the saintly Oswald. It was a stage for some of the most momentous events in early northern English history, including the first conversions to Christianity.\nBede, writing in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People in AD731, tells how the Italian missionary Paulinus, sent by Pope Gregory I, spent 36 days, \u201cmorning to night\u201d, baptising people in the River Glen.\nIt was a place of hospitality, feasting and cultural exchange and would have had visitors from all the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as well as Rome and Ireland. It was also a place of battles and feuding, burned down twice \u2013 by Penda of Mercia and Cadwallon, King of the Britons.\nThe plan is to open a visitor centre and museum in Wooler that tells the vivid story of Ad Gefrin and Northumbria\u2019s Anglo-Saxon golden age. It will include an imagined recreation of the Great Hall with thrones and weapons and objects, showing that the so-called dark ages were far from gloomy. \u201cThey were the most blingy people you could possibly imagine,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cSo this place will look really blingy, with bright, vibrant colours and gold.\u201d\nIf Game of Thrones-type Anglo-Saxon histories bore you, then Ad Gefrin is also creating Northumberland\u2019s first legal single malt whisky distillery offering tours and tasting. The hope is that profits from the distillery will underwrite the more perilous cultural side of the operation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do both, but great if you do,\u201d says Ferguson.\nAfter Wooler, Ferguson hopes people will travel to Yeavering, about four miles away, the picturesque location of the Ad Gefrin archaeological site. Some may even climb Yeavering Bell and discover the iron age hill fort, the largest in northern England.\nFerguson, head of operations and lead curator on the project, said the plan was to open in autumn 2022. Does he see it as a Sutton Hoo of the north? \u201cEffectively, yes. If you want to learn about the early medieval period in the north, I want this to be the place you would naturally come. Northumbria\u2019s golden age is not a period which has had the same attention as Sutton Hoo, and it deserves to.\u201d\nFerguson believes Anglo-Saxon history generally does not always get the attention it deserves. \u201cThis period just gets missed in general education. People might get taught at school the Romans and the Tudors and then the Victorians. You quite often get asked, \u2018So when are the Anglo-Saxons? Which ones do they come between?\u2019\n\u201cThis project is about people and excitement and bringing history to life.\u201d",

        "content": "The town of Monroe, Georgia, is home to views on everything from education to vaccines that are untethered from facts\nIt\u2019s a gray afternoon, promising rain and with temperatures in the 50s, people have taken their jackets out of the closet.\nThe streets of downtown Monroe, Georgia, a town of about 14,000 residents 45 miles due east of Atlanta, are quiet for a Saturday. It\u2019s the county seat of Walton county and a monument honoring Confederate veterans stands tall outside the county courthouse. The soldier carved from granite looks across Broad Street to the town\u2019s police station and is flanked to the south by the Walton Tribune\u2019s office and a district office for representative Jody Hice.\nHice, a Republican and former pastor and talkshow host, has announced his candidacy for Georgia\u2019s next secretary of state and is one of three candidates for statewide offices in next year\u2019s national elections who have received Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Unsurprisingly, 74% of Walton county\u2019s residents voted for Trump last November.\nAnd, although Monroe had the opportunity on 2 November to vote for Democrat Emilio Kelly as the town\u2019s first Black mayor in its 200 years of history, residents three days before election day wanted to talk about what one man called the \u201cdisastrous\u201d state of affairs they see in the US. (Kelly would go on to lose.)\nA year on from an election Trump lost, they believe they\u2019re living in a country where Joe Biden was not legitimately elected, the government is paying people not to work and the state is contaminating children\u2019s minds in public schools, while violating the rights of parents by insisting on teaching about racism that \u201chappened a long time ago\u201d. Some are pretty sure Covid was created in a lab, that \u201cnatural\u201d immunity works fine and that vaccines could make you sicker.\nThe situation is so dire that the current administration has \u201cpossibly damaged our country permanently\u201d, said Patrick Graham, owner of the Tribune and author of a recent editorial titled, \u201cY\u2019all Biden Folks Proud Yet?\u201d\nNone of the Trump supporters picking up pizza or visiting candle and antiques stores downtown believed the presidential vote tallies announced a year ago were accurate. They pointed to the allegations made prominent in Trump\u2019s failed lawsuits across the country and in Georgia.\n\u201cWith everyone screaming, \u2018Let\u2019s Go Brandon\u2019, there\u2019s no way in the world he had 81m votes,\u201d said Mark Kramer, a 68-year-old retiree who moved from nearby Lawrenceville a year ago.\nA couple of blocks south, Mike, a 53-year-old, self-described \u201cgood ol\u2019 country boy\u201d who didn\u2019t want his last name known, had stopped at a gas station before heading home to watch the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. He believes the 2020 election was \u201cfixed\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a conspiracy person \u2026 but the more thought I put into it \u2026 not in the state of Georgia, I don\u2019t believe it happened,\u201d he said, referring to Biden winning the popular vote.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go so far as to say it was stolen, but ballots were trashed and a lot of things went wrong \u2013 including here in Georgia,\u201d said Holland, a 54-year-old legal assistant at an Atlanta corporate law firm who was walking her dog Henry in the late afternoon drizzle.\nAbout half the people the Guardian spoke to in Monroe had been vaccinated, a figure in line with Georgia as a whole, consistently in the bottom of national rankings for vaccination rates. Graham, the Tribune editor, expressed concern over the \u201cgovernment forcing an experimental chemical into people\u2019s bodies to keep them employed \u2026 If we keep going in this direction, it\u2019s going to erode our freedoms.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for masks or vaccines,\u201d said Jason Mealer, a 38-year-old McDonald\u2019s employee. \u201cWe had Ebola here and that was deadly. Why do something about it now? I say, just live your life.\u201d\nRetiree Mark Kramer said \u201cthere\u2019s no ingredients you can read\u201d in Covid vaccines, and that they are \u201cpoison \u2013 they\u2019ll cause you more disease than anything else\u201d. No one in his family had been vaccinated, he added, pointing to a restaurant nearby where they were waiting for him. Kramer didn\u2019t want his picture taken; his son-in-law standing nearby explained their objections: \u201cYou have BLM, antifa \u2013 you have no idea what they might do\u201d if a photograph were to appear online.\nThe personal impacts of global or macroeconomic forces were also on people\u2019s minds in downtown Monroe, without much interest in the global or macro sides of the equation. High gas prices, bottled supply chains, short staffing \u2013 consensus was, they are all due to the current administration.\n\u201cI went to Ihop and their schedule had changed to 7am to 4pm due to staff shortages,\u201d said Holland. \u201cPeople in my own town are staying at home instead of working,\u201d she said. \u201cBiden is paying people to stay home.\u201d\nThe notion that radical changes have taken place in how students from kindergarten through grade 12 are taught about race and racism in US history \u2013 tagged as CRT or critical race theory \u2013 is not absent among Trump supporters in Monroe, where most Black and white residents live in separate parts of town to this day. CRT is an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. It is not taught in Georgia schools.\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with what\u2019s being taught in schools,\u201d said Holland. \u201cParents should have a say, and teaching kids that white people are racist is the wrong thing. It\u2019s almost like they want to recreate history,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBringing in CRT is not what teaching is all about,\u201d she said. \u201cPreparing for college, for the real world, is what it\u2019s about. Not about race, or anything else.\u201d\nBut race \u2013 and racism \u2013 is woven into Monroe\u2019s history.\nA few miles from where Holland spoke, in 1946, a mob of several dozen white people shot and lynched two Black couples, by Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge, which crosses the Appalachee River.\nThe gruesome act of violence led a 17-year-old Martin Luther King Jr to write a letter to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and President Harry Truman ordered the FBI to investigate. No one was found guilty. In an ongoing lawsuit, the 11th circuit US court of appeals ruled in March of last year that grand jury records from the case must remain sealed, keeping all of us from potentially learning what happened that day, and who was responsible.\nThe Moore\u2019s Ford lynching persists not just in the courts, and the memories of many; only two months ago, Monroe\u2019s mayor, John Howard, presented a statement to the town\u2019s city council publicly acknowledging it for the first time. One Black city council member refused to sign the statement, calling it a political stunt aimed at currying favor among the town\u2019s Black voters in Howard\u2019s bid for re-election.\nShould schools in Monroe teach children about the lynching at Moore\u2019s Ford? If so, how? \u201cThat sort of history \u2013 though it was ghastly \u2013 should be taught,\u201d said Jeff Blackstone, a 58-year-old who owns a company that installs hotel TV systems. \u201cBut \u2013 we have all learned from our mistakes. Although there are still some outliers who go back to the horrid ways of previous years, that should not be tolerated. And I \u2026 don\u2019t agree with what the government is trying to do with our lives \u2013 like CRT \u2013 trying to teach us societal views.\u201d\n\u201cI think we need to move beyond Black, white and brown,\u201d Blackstone said. \u201cI hire and fire people and don\u2019t judge by their color, but what they can do to help me.\u201d\nJames \u201cTrae\u201d Welborn III, associate professor of history at Georgia College & State University, says racism and its expression have changed over time.\n\u201cRacism now takes seemingly benign forms \u2013 talk of personal liberties, colorblindness \u2026 The idea is that racism is people running around in white hoods, burning white crosses. So you say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and anything that falls short of that isn\u2019t racism.\u201d\nWelborn also pointed to the idea that racism happened a long time ago, the shared urgency among Trump supporters to \u201cdeny and marginalize the issue of race and racism, in favor of \u2018the beacon of liberty and freedom\u2019 narrative in American history\u201d. A civil war historian, Welborn sees parallels between the views and rhetoric of Trump supporters and those of the Confederacy. \u201cThere\u2019s even similar language \u2013 the threats of violence: \u2018Come to the Capitol and give \u2019em what for,\u2019\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, in the present, many Trump supporters in Georgia are following Garland Favorito and his organization, VoterGA, which has two lawsuits in state courts tied to last year\u2019s elections. Favorito\u2019s organization is 15 years old and works on election integrity \u2013 a term which was then used in public discourse in reference to issues such as how to employ audit methods that could truly verify elections results, and now is mostly used to underline any supposed evidence that Trump won. Until last year, VoterGA was primarily supported by progressive Democrats. Now, Favorito receives social media followers, and donations, from thousands of Trump supporters, in Georgia and elsewhere.\nAs for last year\u2019s election, he said, \u201cthe truth is, nobody knows who won. The secretary of state [in Georgia] can tell you he knows, but he has no idea.\u201d This is because, he said, allegations of ballot stuffing have not been satisfactorily investigated by the state and a \u201cforensic analysis\u201d of election system servers in the state\u2019s 159 counties has not been performed. The problem is that \u201cnobody wants to get to the truth\u201d.\nAsked about the process followed in Arizona, where a group called Cyber Ninjas took months to review election materials from the state\u2019s largest county \u2013 and still concluded that Joe Biden won \u2013 Favorito said that the group\u2019s work was never really completed, because the state didn\u2019t supply them with everything they sought to examine. This means \u201cwe will never know who won in Arizona\u201d, he said.\nAsked if it concerns him that many of the Trump supporters supporting his work in Georgia are the same people who hold positions such as the vaccine being \u201cpoison\u201d, he said, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t concern me to speak truth \u2026 Trump supporters have just as much a right to say Trump won as the secretary of state says Biden won, because we don\u2019t know the truth.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Social media stars \u2018Wegan\u2019 say branch of NHS\u2019s fertility sector in England discriminates against LGBT+ families\nA married lesbian couple are launching a landmark legal test case against a branch of the NHS fertility sector in England, claiming it discriminates against LGBT+ families.\nInfluencers Megan Bacon-Evans, 34, and her wife Whitney, 33, from Windsor in Berkshire, have accused their clinical commissioning group (CCG), Frimley, of penalising them financially because of their sexuality.\nThe couple, known to their 220,000 followers across YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok as \u201cWegan\u201d, shot to fame as bloggers and LGBT+ role models in 2009, featuring on the BBC\u2019s Britain\u2019s Relationship Secrets documentary and the reality bridal show Say Yes to the Dress.\nThey started a petition for equal treatment in November last year after being \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d at the barriers to starting their family under the current rules, which are often dubbed a \u201cgay tax\u201d.\nFrimley states that same-sex female couples, and single women and people with wombs, must pay for 12 intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF treatments to \u201cprove\u201d medical infertility, costing an estimated \u00a330,000 or more, before receiving NHS help.\nBy contrast, the majority of cisgendered heterosexual couples, including Megan\u2019s sister, are required only to try to conceive for two years.\nCCG Frimley, which covers 800,000 patients across Windsor and Maidenhead, Bracknell Forest, Slough, Surrey Heath, north-east Hampshire and Farnham, denies discrimination.\nOn Monday, the campaigning legal firm Leigh Day, backed by Stonewall UK and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), will apply for a judicial review on behalf of the couple claiming discrimination under the Equality Act and articles eight and 14 of the European convention on human rights, in what could become a major test of the NHS\u2019s treatment of LGBT+ families.\nIf permission is granted, the case could be heard as soon as January in the high court\u2019s administrative division.\nThe couple, who have been married for four years, have so far spent \u00a38,000 on donor sperm and mandatory pre-insemination tests. They have also launched a \u00a310,000 fundraiser to cover potential legal fees, and called for support from the LGBT+ community.\nMegan Bacon-Evans said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for every LGBT+ couple who had to give up on their hopes and dreams of creating a family. It\u2019s time for discrimination to end and for there to be equal treatment with heterosexual couples in the healthcare system.\u201d\nAnna Dews, of Leigh Day, told the Guardian that if the review was successful it could set a \u201cpowerful\u201d precedent to challenge similar \u201cunlawful\u201d policies across the UK.\n\u201cFertility equality\u201d campaigners claim healthcare policies penalise individuals from LGBT+ and low-income backgrounds, forcing many into debt or dangerous, unregulated online deals with men, risking sexual assault, disease and custody battles.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which sets guidelines for England, Northern Ireland and Wales, recommends three IVF cycles for patients under 40. Scotland operates separately.\nBut a British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) report published in June found that England and Northern Ireland imposed \u201csignificant\u201d financial barriers on LGBT+ families and single women.\nAbout 76% of England\u2019s 106 CCGs are accused of a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d, requiring between three and 12 private treatments before offering the same help received by heterosexual couples. Northern Ireland requires four treatments, while Scotland and Wales impose no additional costs.\n\u201cThese restrictions amount to a tax on LGBT+ families, and the impact can be truly devastating,\u201d said Marta Jansa Perez, the BPAS director of embryology. \u201cThe need for reform is urgent. We are proud to stand with Whitney and Megan in their fight for fertility equality, and we applaud their courage for publicly sharing such a personal struggle.\u201d\nEloise Stonborough, Stonewall\u2019s associate director of policy and research, said it was also proud to support the couple, and added: \u201cCurrent Nice fertility guidelines and variations in the services available through local clinical commissioning groups create unacceptable financial and practical barriers that disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ people, particularly lesbians and bi women.\u201d\nWhile prices vary, a round of IUI, which is cheaper than IVF but with a lower success rate, can cost \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000 factoring in the procedure along with the purchase, shipping and storage of medically screened sperm from a bank, mandatory tests, drugs, travel and time off work, according to campaigners.\nIn 2019, the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, promised a fertility sector review, claiming \u201csexual orientation should not be a factor in access to IVF\u201d.\nCCG Frimley has been contacted for comment.",

A spokesperson said \u201cmore niche\u201d varieties had been slowed.\n\u201cA recent IT system upgrade has disrupted the supply of some of our products. Our sites are still making crisps and snacks but at a reduced scale,\u201d a Walkers spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to increase production and get people\u2019s favourites back on shelves. We\u2019re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.\u201d\nThe IT issue has added to the problems faced by the British food industry \u2013 along with most other manufacturers \u2013 during months of delays and disruption caused by the pandemic.\nTesco has been using cardboard cutouts of fruit, vegetables and other groceries to fill gaps on shelves because of supply problems. Shoppers have spotted fake carrots in Fakenham, cardboard asparagus in London, pictures of oranges and grapes in Milton Keynes and 2D washing liquid bottles in Cambridge. Sainsbury\u2019s has also used outline drawings of packaging to fill shelves.\nIn August, McDonald\u2019s blamed supply chain problems when it was forced to pull milkshakes from its menus in Great Britain. The chicken restaurant Nando\u2019s had to close shops because of poultry shortages, and rival chain KFC had to cut some items from its menus.\nSome parts of the food industry have also said they have suffered from worker shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, with European workers facing more hurdles to work in the UK. UK farms have in the last month been forced to slaughter thousands of healthy pigs themselves \u2013 meaning they are not suitable for sale for meat \u2013 because of a shortage of abattoir workers. Some meat processors have also resorted to shipping carcasses to the EU to be butchered, before bringing them back to sell in the UK.\nBeyond the food industry, companies have warned of possible future shortages of products ranging from fake tan to toys, with issues ranging from power cuts in China to shortages of container space and lorry drivers once products reach the UK.\nSupply shortages have reached their worst levels since the mid-1970s, according to surveys by the Confederation of British Industry, the UK\u2019s biggest business lobby group.\nThe supply chain problems have highlighted rich economies\u2019 reliance on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries and automated processes. Walkers\u2019 main crisp factory in Leicester is usually able to churn out as many as 5m bags a day, and production normally only stops on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day, according to the Leicester Mercury.\nWalkers, which is owned by the US food and drink conglomerate PepsiCo, is usually relatively profitable. Accounts from 2020 showed profits at Walkers of \u00a338m from revenues of \u00a3265m despite higher health and safety costs because of the pandemic.",

        "content": "Voters in Virginia and New Jersey this week sounded a serious warning to Democrats, key players in the Biden administration and Congress said on Sunday: the party needs to get things done or it faces disaster in midterm elections next year.\nThe energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said \u201cwe thank God\u201d something was done on Friday night: a $1tn infrastructure deal sent to Joe Biden\u2019s desk by the House.\nThree days after Democrats lost a race for governor in one state Biden won comfortably and barely held the other, House centrists and progressives managed to come together, with some Republican support.\nBiden hailed a \u201cmonumental step forward\u201d and a \u201cblue-collar blueprint to rebuild America\u201d. He also said \u201cthe one message that came across\u201d in Virginia and New Jersey was: \u201cGet something done.\u201d\nRon Klain, the White House chief of staff, echoed his boss, telling NBC\u2019s Meet the Press the American people \u201cwanted to see more action in Washington. They wanted to see things move more quickly, and three days later, Congress responded.\u201d\nBut Democrats punted again on the second half of the president\u2019s domestic agenda, the 10-year, $1.75tn Build Back Better package to boost health and social care and to seek to mitigate the impact of the climate crisis.\nGranholm told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI think that the Democrats in the House got the message very loud and clear. Pass the bill and pass the second part too, because these contain things that everyday people care about.\n\u201cThe governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, ran on the phrase \u2018Fix the damn roads\u2019. And that\u2019s what this bill does. It fixes the damn roads. It fixes the bridges. It gets broadband to real people. It fixes your homes so that they\u2019re not leaking energy.\u201d\nGranholm also said the infrastructure bill did not help with childcare and other \u201ccosts of living for real people\u201d. That, she said, is the job of Build Back Better, which now awaits analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, a measure demanded by centrists.\nThe New Jersey centrist Josh Gottheimer told CNN he and his allies wanted to make sure the bill was \u201cfiscally responsible and paid for\u201d. He said he was confident it would pass but dodged when asked repeatedly if his group would vote no if CBO analysis differed from White House and congressional estimates.\nIn New Jersey, the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, won by an unexpectedly narrow margin. Taking a page from Donald Trump\u2019s playbook, the Republican Jack Ciattarelli has refused to concede.\nIn Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, suffered a devastating defeat by Glenn Youngkin, a businessman who kept Trump at arm\u2019s length while campaigning on culture war issues including the place of race in education.\nAsked if Youngkin could have been beaten had major legislation been passed in Washington before election day, Mark Warner, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told CNN: \u201cI wish the House would have moved earlier.\u201d\nWarner also said voters needed to be told what was in the Biden bills, rather than what they cost. The bills\u2019 cost is regularly condemned by Republicans \u2013 and by Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who remains a key obstacle in the Senate.\nThe White House adviser Cedric Richmond told Fox News Sunday that Manchin was \u201ca lot more conservative and everybody sees that but he\u2019s been a willing partner to come to the table with constructive dialogue. And we\u2019re confident in where we will go with our Build Back Better framework. We\u2019re optimistic we\u2019re going to get it done. And the truth is we need to get it done.\u201d\nRichmond also rejected Republican claims that increased spending will add to inflation. Granholm said the administration saw current inflation as \u201ctransitory\u201d.\nLarry Hogan, the governor of Maryland and a Republican moderate with presidential ambitions, told CNN Biden had \u201cnearly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory\u201d.\nThe infrastructure bill \u201cshould have been an overwhelming win back in August\u201d, Hogan said. \u201cAnd I think [Biden] should not have let it get sidetracked by the progressives in the House. I think that was bad for Joe Biden. I think that was reflected in the election results because I think they misread the mandate.\n\u201cYou know, Joe Biden won a very narrow election by winning swing voters and they\u2019re not where the progressive caucus is, I can assure you, and the vast majority of Americans are not for the second bill.\u201d\nProgressives contend otherwise. In tweets on Saturday, the Washington state congresswoman Pramila Jayapal highlighted news from the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow and said: \u201cThis is EXACTLY why we need the Build Back Better Act. We will deliver climate action \u2013 for our communities, future generations, and our planet.\u201d\nShe also retweeted the Rev William Barber, the leader of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. He said: \u201cMy prayer is that Congress will keep its word and vote to pass Build Back Better, because if not, that political betrayal will be a political crime and integrity breach.\u201d\nSuch a failure, Barber said, \u201cwould abandon over 140 million poor and low-wealth people who make up 43% of the nation and 30% of the voting population\u201d.\nThat, he said, \u201ccould split the Democratic party in ways that may be irreparable\u201d.",

        "content": "One of the world\u2019s largest bird counts is \u2018hours of terror separated by minutes of boredom\u2019\n\u201cTwo-hundred pelicans breeding, 20 whiskered terns, 100 grey teal, 30 black swans, one little pied cormorant \u2026\u201d\nRichard Kingsford, a veteran ecologist, is rattling off the waterbirds he\u2019s spotting below. He clutches his voice recorder closely to overcome the engine noise as our Cessna banks steeply, tracking the shoreline of Lake Brewster, a large lake in central-west New South Wales.\nJohn Porter, a NSW government scientist and fellow veteran bird counter, does the same, dictating the numbers and bird species he glimpses on the starboard side \u2013 while giving directions to pilot James Barkell \u2013 as we fly at 185kmh and barely 30m above the water.\nWe\u2019re on a three-day trip that is part of the annual waterbird survey, now in its 39th year. One of the world\u2019s longest continuous bird counts, it\u2019s also among the largest, spanning 2.7m square km \u2013 11 times the size of UK or six times California.\nAfter the second circuit of the water body to provide a routine counting check, Kingsford asks Barkell to fly over the main pelican breeding colony near the lake\u2019s middle so he can film it.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to gun it\u201d we hear Barkell say in our headphones. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm cell sitting over it.\u201d\nAfter weathering the buffeting, we navigate between low ranges of hills and over verdant fields on the way to our next destination, Lake Cargelligo. Porter declares Brewster a success story for birds: \u201cThere were absolutely boatloads\u201d.\nLake Cowal, another big lake that was only beginning to fill earlier this year, reveals other sizeable breeding colonies, including straw-necked and white ibises.\n\u201cThe only thing missing was glossies,\u201d Kingsford says, referring to the glossy ibis variety. \u201cI did see some but they weren\u2019t breeding,\u201d Porter responds.\n\u201cThat gives me a thrill, that kind of thing,\u201d Kingsford adds, picking up his laptop to make notes and communicate with home base back in Sydney.\nThe excitement is still there for Kingsford even on his 36th consecutive year on the eastern Australia waterbird survey. Porter has notched up almost 30 years.\nFor Barkell, it\u2019s just his second year out, steering the NSW parks service plane along the east-west flight bands that will take in as many as 2,000 wetlands in a wet year such as this.\nHis usual job is piloting Airbus A330s to and from Asia and the US west coast that are 60 times heavier than our Cessna Caravan, but far more automated.\n\u201cPull up, pull up\u201d are warnings we hear regularly as we zero in on our targets.\nBarkell says he started out mustering cattle at the 1m-hectare Helen Springs station in the Northern Territory. He flew so low to scare bulls from under trees that his plane \u201chad to climb the fences\u201d and he would have to pull grass from the wheel struts, the 39-year-old pilot says, somewhat apocryphally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hours of boredom broken up by minutes of sheer terror,\u201d the pilot jokes about the jetliners as we walk to breakfast in Deniliquin, our Riverina base for a night. \u201cWhereas this is hours of terror separated by minutes of boredom.\u201d\nOur plane \u2013 and the four of us on board \u2013 gets a decent workout. Though ranking only \u201cfour on the vomitometer\u201d, according to Porter, day one in the air involves many tight turns, and has your correspondent grateful for three \u201cSic-Sacs\u201d.\nDay two (and two sick bags) involves spells of severe buffeting, along with steep turns, ad nauseum, but by day three, this hanger-on is hanging on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting. We\u2019re putting in eight-hour days [in the air], flying at low levels in conditions like this at times,\u201d Barkell says as a rainstorm sweeps across Dubbo airport where we are preparing for the final leg back to Sydney.\nPiloting involves constant adjustments of rudders, with Barkell watching out for changing wind patterns over the water that might warn him of sudden shifts.\nBarkell reckons he can identify a range of birds, like pelicans, grey teals and other ducks. \u201cI sort of liken it to going on a six-week geography field trip.\u201d\nFor Kingsford and Porter, it\u2019s a tiring but vital task to keep tabs on the health of ecosystems stretching from the Lake Eyre basin (when there\u2019s water) in the Red Centre to Queensland\u2019s rainforests and the lakes at the end of the Murray River.\nAs waterbird species feast on different food \u2013 from aquatic vegetation to invertebrates and fish \u2013 their numbers offer a guide to the health of the rivers and lakes.\nBird tallying of more than 50 species can only be an approximation and requires skills that can be honed by computer simulations such as Wildlife Counts. The birds\u2019 colour, shape and size are among identifying cues, as are their flight patterns when they are disturbed by the plane.\n\u201cSmall grebes dive and so you just see a splash often, although not aways,\u201d Kingsford says, listing some of the tricky ones to spy.\n\u201cSeparating out the little black from the great cormorants, and the little pied from the large pied [cormorants] is a challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there are the Australasian shoveler, which are rare and can look like a black duck.\u201d\nThe way the birds scatter, often at different heights and directions, in one reason why drones aren\u2019t yet a suitable substitute. \u201cThe human is eye is so much better at changing its focal length,\u201d Kingsford says.\nTypically, the startled birds react too slowly to fly near us with our 46m target cruising height, although our first day collected one unfortunate avian on the windscreen. It was unlikely to be a waterbird, Porter says after we land in dusty Broken Hill.\nThe daily results are fed back to the University of NSW, where they are processed by a team and provided to the state and federal agencies such as the Murray Darling Basin Authority that finance the research.\nCovid-forced delays getting into Queensland and South Australia mean this year\u2019s flights won\u2019t be completed until mid-December, with the lingering possibility of last-minute cancellations disrupting plans.\nThe past two wet years after a severe drought mean conditions are primed for a major breeding event, but so far the surveyors haven\u2019t seen one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking really encouraging,\u201d Kingsford says after we land back at Bankstown, in Sydney\u2019s west. \u201cThere\u2019s water in the Paroo, there\u2019s water in a bit of the Darling and the Macquarie and a little bit in the Gwydir [rivers], but there\u2019s not a massive flood\u201d that would spark mass breeding.\nLonger term, though the trend is clear, with about a 70% decline in numbers since the survey began as human-made dams and diversions have proliferated.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got places where at one point there were hardly any of these private storages, and they are sort of mushrooming along the river systems,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhen you start taking that water out of the system, you\u2019ve got the inevitable consequences of less habitat for these water birds to breed and build up in numbers.\u201d\n Climate change, with its likely greater flux between extremes of dry and wet,\u201cis like an extra veneer of impact on the top,\u201d Kingsford says.\nNearing 63, the professor \u2013 who runs UNSW\u2019s Centre for Ecosystem Science among many other roles \u2013 isn\u2019t about to give up his annual surveys just yet. It\u2019s unclear if other capable bird counters able to withstand turbulence will take over when he does.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something my wife has asked me every year for the past 36 years,\u201d he laughs, adding \u201ccertainly [there\u2019s] at least three or four, or maybe a few more than that.\u201d",

        "content": "Why do I identify with my Aboriginal family and not my Irish and English ancestry? There are many reasons, and they are all compelling\nEvery now and then a troll calls me white. It\u2019s a violent colonial tactic: call me white if I identify as blak, call me blak if I wanted to identify as white. My self-identity is not important to them, nor is that of any other Indigenous person, or any person of colour. Wadjelas demand the right to define others, just defining themselves is not enough. They demand to define whiteness and blakness.\nIt was the wadjelas that created the \u2018one drop\u2019 rule, that defined anybody with a single bla(c)k ancestor as black. They did that to separate people, to create a caste system, to protect the notion of whiteness, to protect whiteness from the merest \u2018impurity\u2019, from the merest influx of colour. Rather than accept that bla(c)k and white people are more alike than different, rather than accept that \u2018half-castes\u2019 are just people, one drop was enough, one drop was too much.\nIt was the racist, settler colonialism that created whiteness, that created blackness, half-caste, quarter-caste, octoroon, that saw mixed-race people as a third race.\nNow those same wadjelas, who defined us as black, now want to call us white if we are not black enough for their liking.\nI am not quite white, not quite blak enough. I wish I was blakker on the outside; as blak on the outside as I feel on the inside.\nI\u2019m a Vegemite sandwich on brown bread.\nIf I was blakker I would suffer hate for the colour of my skin; that alone, blakkness, darkness would be enough, I would suffer discrimination for being dark, even the word darkness has, in English, a negative connotation. The colour of my father\u2019s skin, my grandmother\u2019s, my great-grandmother\u2019s is a metaphor, a code for evil. We are the darkness.\nAnd then.\nI suffer discrimination because some people think I am too white to be seen as blak; that I should not identify as Aboriginal, that I should not have the right. Some people would try to remove my access to Aboriginal culture, would try to say I am too white, too mixed-race, to be allowed access to my Country and culture, family and land. Those same people think I should not access Aboriginal resources, affirmative action, land rights.\nThe people who want to restrict my access to culture are not my family, not other Aboriginal people, not the land councils or the elders. The people who think I am too white to be Aboriginal are all white. It\u2019s the wadjelas who think I am not blak enough; the same people who discriminated against my dad by calling him black.\nWe see it all the time in the media, oft repeated despite the fact that it\u2019s racial vilification, and against the law. Aboriginal people aren\u2019t Aboriginal, we are told, if we are mixed race, if we live in the city, if we are educated, if we do too well, if we are not \u2018from the bush\u2019. And \u2018from the bush\u2019 is coded language for stone-age, removed from modern society, unemployable and \u2018traditional\u2019.\n\u2018Traditional\u2019 is such loaded language, enshrining a belief that we are stuck in the past rather than being one of the most adaptable cultures in history, that some of us are using \u2018classical\u2019 instead when referring to any part of Aboriginal culture that appears similar to what it is imagined we produced before wadjela came.\nThe right-wing media, and even some of the more centrist media, draws an artificial line between the bush and the city, the urban blaks and the people from the bush. The division is often coded to skin colour, urban is shorthand for \u2018not black enough\u2019 and bush is shorthand for \u2018real Aboriginal\u2019.\nAnd to the racists in the colony, who cannot still grasp the concept that races can mix, who are obsessed with 18th- century notions of race, mixed-race Aboriginal people are no longer Aboriginal.\nModern people do not understand very well that in the 18th century it was a common belief that races cannot mix, that mixed-race children of any two \u2018races\u2019 would become a third race; neither white or black. If an Aboriginal woman had a child with a white father that child would not be white or black, they would be a third race and them having children with any other culture would dilute the race of both parents. This belief was one of the drivers of the \u2018protection\u2019 laws that led to the settler government\u2019s theft of children. AO Neville, the Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia until the 1930s, railed against the risk of the creation of a \u2018third race\u2019 of half-castes. Protectors took the mixed-race children, \u2018half-castes\u2019, \u2018quarter-castes\u2019, \u2018octoroons\u2019, from their parents, from their culture, raised the light-skinned ones white, at an orphanage, and trained the darker-skinned ones to be domestic servants for the colonisers.\nIt was believed that skin colour also coded for children\u2019s ability to assimilate. I would have been perfect for assimilation. There was no way the protectors would have left me with my family.\nThey knew, the protectors and the other colonisers, where those mixed-race babies were coming from. There were records from Neville from the many times he asked for local protectors to remove girls before they came of age and to the attention of the white man (the attention they were referring to was sexual, obviously). He did not want a \u2018third race\u2019 to be created or continued.\nColonisers also believed that one drop of non-white blood was enough to be considered not white.\nNot all mixed-race Aboriginal people were the product of rape. My grandmother was married to my grandfather. My great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother were married to white men. However, rape was common and many mixed-race children were the product of rape, and thus of colonisation. Maybe all mixed-race children were, blak mothers marrying white men to gain their protection, blak men marrying white women in the hope their children would be lighter-skinned and less prone to racism.\nNo matter what happens to Aboriginal children of mixed race, no matter whose \u2018fault\u2019 it is that their skin is lighter than they would like, it\u2019s not their fault. Nobody gets to choose their race. I am mixed-race because my family is and I did not choose my family.\nNor would I choose to be anything other than who I am.\nOnce mixed-race children were born they were taken from their parents. Under the protection acts in Western Australia, mixed-race Aboriginal children were routinely taken from their parents; the parents, in fact, had no rights to their own children. The Department of the Protector controlled every aspect of the mixed-race child\u2019s life, including if, when and to whom they could marry. This policy was to ensure that mixed-race Aboriginal people could only marry white people to breed the next generation whiter.\nThere can be no doubt that all mixed-race Aboriginal people are a product of colonisation; and the attempt to define us as not Aboriginal enough is also part of colonisation. It was policy to commit genocide by breeding, by eugenics, to breed out the black to \u2018fuck us white\u2019.\nI am a mixed-race person not quite blak enough, and will never be white, I will never be white at all. It doesn\u2019t really matter. I know who I am, so does my family, so does Noongar Boodjar, my country.\nColonisers often ask me why I don\u2019t identify with my Irish and English ancestry, why I prefer to identify with my Aboriginal family. There are many reasons \u2013 all of them, to my mind, compelling. The first is the simplest: if you could identify with the bully or the victim, with the murderers or the family of the murdered, with the genocidal colonisers or the colonised, who would you choose?\nSecondly, if you were part of the culture that belongs somewhere, the first people, the people with a unique connection to the place, wouldn\u2019t you live in that pride?\nFinally, the colonisers were attempting genocide, they wanted us all dead. If I identified with my wadjela ancestry at the expense of my Aboriginality, the colonisers win.\nI am under no illusions about my mixed-race status; I know I am mixed-race, but with the Aboriginal population being only 3 per cent, with my family being survivors of genocide, I have made my decision.\nThere\u2019s a saying among blak mob, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how much milk you put in tea, it\u2019s still tea.\u2019 I am a descendant of genocide survivors, a child of the oldest living culture on Earth. Nothing, no amount of milk, can change that.\nThis is an edited extract from Lies, Damned Lies \u2013 A personal exploration of the impact of colonisation, by Claire G Coleman (Ultimo Press), out now.",

        "content": "High-profile experts cast doubt over the bulk of the country\u2019s touted reductions in greenhouse pollution\nAustralia is likely to be releasing more emissions from deforestation than reported to the United Nations, new analysis indicates, stoking calls for an independent review of the sector that has delivered the bulk of the country\u2019s claimed reductions in greenhouse gas pollution in recent decades.\nAn assessment of satellite imagery of more than 50 properties in Queensland by Martin Taylor, an adjunct senior lecturer at the University of Queensland, has identified significant discrepancies between what is treated as cleared land by Australia\u2019s National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) and the Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) used by the state government.\n\u201cIt flummoxes me \u2013 what\u2019s going on in their models when they are missing such obvious land clearing,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHow can you possibly say that\u2019s still forest \u2026 it\u2019s so glaringly obvious something is wrong.\u201d\nHow countries have treated emissions from the land sector \u2013 clumsily known as Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LuluCF) \u2013 has been contentious for decades, partly because of the challenges of accurately measuring and monitoring what can be subtle changes in vegetation even between seasons and periods of drought and wet spells.\nThe Australian government has relied on its reporting of falls in land-clearing rates for almost all the reductions that allow it to claim the country\u2019s emissions have fallen by about one-fifth since 2005, and that Australia has \u201cover-achieved\u201d on its pledged cuts under the Kyoto protocol.\nAn accurate estimate of changing vegetation cover also underpins the veracity of carbon offsets, with the majority of claimed cuts paid for through the federal government\u2019s emissions reduction fund going to the land sector. Its new long-term emission reduction plan to reach net zero by 2050 also relies heavily on it.\n\u201cEmissions from [LuluCF] have fallen by 114m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent since 2005, and in 2019 the sector represented a 25 Mt CO\u2082-e sink for Australia,\u201d the government\u2019s net zero plan report states. Australia reports annual emissions of about 500m tonnes.\nDeforestation has featured at Cop26 the climate summit in Glasgow, with Australia among the 105 nations to sign a pledge to reduce forest loss by 2030.\nAccounting rules agreed to under the UN framework convention on climate change help countries minimise loss of their forests. Under those rules, tree crown cover needs to amount for only 10% to 30% of an area of less than one hectare for it to be treated as a forest. Australia takes the mid-point of the range at 20%.\nTaylor said the 20% estimate was \u201ca fundamental issue\u201d that meant NCAS \u201cjust completely misses\u201d land clearing.\n\u201cWhere forest tree cover gets reduced down from 100% to 30% or 20%, to them it\u2019s still a forest and nothing\u2019s changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge.\u201d\nTaylor and other researchers said even 20% coverage could be understating actual clearing because the models used are less accurate than the Slats detection used by Queensland and other states, including NSW.\nQuestions over the reliability of Australia\u2019s land sector emissions accounting are not new.\nAs far back as 2007, Andrew Macintosh of the Australian National University law school called for an independent review of NCAS, without which the \u201cfederal government\u2019s claims about Australia\u2019s performance against its Kyoto target should be treated with scepticism\u201d.\nGlenn Walker, then with the Wilderness Society, also compiled a report highlighting how Queensland\u2019s land clearing rates rocketed after the LNP under Campbell Newman came to power in 2012, yet Australia\u2019s emissions continued to fall during that period.\nExcluding land use, national emissions had risen by more than 5% since 2005 \u2013 the base year picked by the Abbott government for Australia\u2019s Paris climate goal \u2013 before Covid-19 lockdowns began. Carbon pollution in other rich economies fell in that timeframe.\nResearchers say there are \u201cmillions of anecdotes\u201d to illustrate areas where land-clearing has been picked up by Slats, but not by NCAS. One case involved NCAS identifying a dam as a forest because of its dark colour.\nDon Butler, an ecologist formerly at the Queensland Herbarium and now a professor at ANU, worked with the Slats program for years. He said NCAS used Landsat imagery at 25m to detect vegetation and alterations, while Slats used 10m pixels.\n\u201cJust that change alone will change the estimate of the area cleared,\u201d he said.\n Stuart Phinn, a professor at the University of Queensland specialising in the use of remote sensing to measure environmental changes, said Newman\u2019s policies \u201cdid have a large impact on clearing\u201d that were picked up by Slats.\nReports at the time estimated Queensland landholders were clearing 10 sq km a day in 2015-16. The environment minister, Steven Miles, estimated carbon emissions at 45m tonnes over that year.\nSlats doesn\u2019t itself calculate emissions. As with NCAS, the emissions are inferred by the vegetation change identified in satellite images that is assessed using complex algorithms. The next Slats report for 2018-19 will be released by the end of 2021.\nButler said: \u201cThe reason Slats is more accurate is that a human looks at every bit of clearing that\u2019s reported and decides that it is clearing, and that\u2019s not something that NCAS is resourced to do.\u201d\nPhinn, Butler and other researchers do not suggest there is any intent by NCAS to mislead on emissions, but stress the need for more transparency.\n\u201cIt would be good to go more public with their modelling validation,\u201d Phinn said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s open enough.\u201d\nThe emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, passed a request for comment to the energy department, which said any suggestion that the Australian government had underestimated land clearing was \u201cmisplaced\u201d.\n\u201cThe Australian government prepares the national greenhouse accounts in accordance with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines,\u201d a department spokesperson said, citing the approach detailed in the national inventory report.\n\u201cThe methods and data are reviewed every year by teams of international experts assembled by the UNFCCC secretariat in Bonn. The international architecture that governs the National Greenhouse Accounts is designed to give confidence that the data are accurate, comparable and time-series consistent.\u201d\nMartine Maron, professor of environmental management at the University of Queensland, said the complexity of the processes was one reason emissions from land clearing had not drawn as much public scrutiny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue in Australia,\u201d Maron said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a problem for a long time. It\u2019s really, really hard to understand and it\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d\n\u201cEssentially [NCAS and Slats] are using the same input data but they\u2019re classifying change in different way,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve spent years trying to get my head around it.\u201d\nButler said there were reasons to question the accounting even after recent revisions, including the increasing area assessed to be regrowth on previously cleared land.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now worth about 10-12m tonnes [of CO2] of sequestration a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bit \u2026 I have the least faith in I suppose, and it is a significant part of the story.\u201d\n Head of consulting at Ndevr Environmental, Matt Drum, and also formerly with the federal department of climate change, said land use changes were not reliably calculated, so his firm focused on tracking carbon emissions by the rest of the economy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bit of a black box, it\u2019s a massive black box,\u201d Drum says. \u201cIt\u2019s at the point where you report without LuluCF \u2013 it\u2019s much more reliable.\u201d\nThe Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said Scott Morrison \u201cboasts of meeting and beating terrible targets, but his claimed 20% emissions cuts [since 2005] rely on accounting changes that the experts now question\u201d.\n\u201cTake out the land sector and it\u2019s unstable greenhouse accounting and the Liberals haven\u2019t reduced emissions since 2005 at all,\u201d Bandt said.\nPhinn and Butler said space-based remote sensing was rapidly advancing and systems would soon be available that more precisely detected height and density of vegetation, so that regrowth of grass, for instance, was not treated as if it were more woody plants. Whether governments use the technology to adjust and even reinterpret past data is another matter.\nWith the land sector also accounting for more than 60% of Australian carbon credits and more than three-quarters of contracted abatement under the ERF, potentially billions of dollars of offsets and sequestration claims are riding on good data.\nWill Steffen, a researcher at ANU, helped advise the Labor government under Julia Gillard on how to nudge companies to reduce their emissions rather than rely on offsets to do their work.\n\u201c[We wanted] to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a get out of jail free card by using land offsets in place of actually reducing fossil fuel emissions,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cThe land sector screamed up and down that that wasn\u2019t fair because then as now there are companies in those industries who make money off offsets.\u201d\nSteffen said: \u201cI think we need a really thorough review of the entire land clearing process. That\u2019s not just accounting, but how we use land carbon vis-a-vis fossil fuel emissions.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Regulator asked interview panellists to be replaced as they were \u2018not sufficiently independent\u2019\nA watchdog had to prevent ministers breaching a strict code on political neutrality and independence during the search for new chairs for the BBC and the British Film Institute (BFI), the Guardian can reveal.\nA Freedom of Information Act response by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (Ocpa) showed that ministers were asked to replace interview panellists for the high-profile jobs because they were \u201cnot sufficiently independent\u201d.\nThe regulator has described such breaches as \u201cthreatening to undermine the independent status\u201d of a role intended to bring \u201cchallenge and rigour\u201d to finding appointable candidates for selection by cabinet ministers, including the prime minister.\nThe regulator also stepped in twice to demand changes to the panel selecting potential candidates to chair the Office for Students, which regulates universities.\nIt comes amid growing concern that the government is seeking to \u201crebalance\u201d the boards of public bodies \u2013 particularly in the arts, heritage and broadcasting sectors \u2013 by appointing allies and blocking critics, in part to help it fight \u201cculture wars\u201d.\nThe Tory party co-chair Oliver Dowden last month caused anger when he pledged to pick a new chair for the Charity Commission who would \u201creset the balance\u201d after Dowden said some charities had been \u201chijacked by a vocal minority seeking to burnish their woke credentials\u201d. This year, the regulator cleared the National Trust of breaching its charitable objectives in examining links between its properties and histories of colonialism and slavery, including Winston Churchill\u2019s house at Chartwell.\nCharity bosses hit back, saying: \u201cThe commission must be above party politics.\u201d\nMinisters have also been embroiled this week in a scandal over sleaze and attempts to undermine the independent parliamentary standards watchdog.\nOn Thursday, Jonathan Evans, the chair of the committee on standards in public life, cited concerns about ministers \u201cseeking to pack assessment panels with majorities of political affiliates\u201d and called for the commissioner for public appointments to be consulted on all panellist choices. Lord Evans also called for the role to be strengthened in primary legislation so ministers could not abolish the watchdog or limit its powers if they objected to its actions.\nPeter Riddell, who until last month was the commissioner for public appointments, took the action on interview panellists before the appointments were made in January and February this year. In all cases, the ministers followed his advice and appointed different panellists whom the watchdog judged sufficiently independent.\nThe appointments to lead the BBC and the Office for Students prompted public controversy because of their links to the Conservative party.\nRichard Sharp, a former adviser to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who has donated more than \u00a3400,000 to the Tory party, was picked as BBC chair, while the Conservative peer and donor James Wharton was selected to oversee the Office for Students.\nAlso in February, Tim Richards, the founder of Vue cinemas, was selected to lead the BFI. Richards has not declared any political activity, which is defined as standing for elected office, donating to a party, or working or speaking publicly for one.\nVacancies on the boards of public bodies include a new chair for Ofwat, which regulates the water and sewage companies that have been accused of polluting seas and rivers while making substantial profits.\nThere are no rules preventing ministers from appointing political allies to roles leading public bodies. However, the panels selecting appointable candidates for the highest-profile positions must include a non-political senior independent panel member (SIPM).\nRiddell disagreed with ministers\u2019 choices of SIPMs, who \u201cwere not sufficiently independent as set out in the [public appointments] code\u201d, which requires them to not be politically active, to be independent of the department and of the body concerned, and to be familiar with senior recruitment and the public appointments principles.\nThe individuals removed from the panels have not been named, with Ocpa citing Freedom of Information Act exemptions and suggesting this could \u201cinhibit the free and frank provision of advice and exchange of views\u201d and \u201cprejudice the effective conduct of public affairs\u201d. In a tweet last October, Riddell said he had challenged panellist choices and stressed \u201cthey need to be independent of the party\u201d.\nRiddell told the Guardian the five-strong panel assembled by the Department for Education for the Office for Students role included three people \u201cclearly with Tory party links and arguably a fourth had some ... Also there was no one with recent higher education student experience.\u201d\nThe final panel included Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff Nick Timothy, the former Tory MP Eric Ollerenshaw and the Tory peer Laura Wyld. There is no rule against ministers appointing politically active panel members unless they are the designated SIPM.\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Education, which oversaw the appointments, declined to comment.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe commissioner found no breaches of the code in the cases highlighted; he was properly consulted by ministers as required.\u201d Officials stressed that the number of people declaring significant political links to the Conservatives remained low, at 2% of the the 1,500 public appointments in the last year.\nRiddell said the problems with the Office for Students process made it \u201can outlier\u201d, but he added: \u201cThe balance of some panels has led one to lift eyebrows \u2026 The row over that has had beneficial side-effects. The balance of panels of other big competitions have on the whole been pretty good.\u201d\nThe panellists recommending the BBC chair included Catherine Baxendale, who was shortlisted to be a Tory parliamentary candidate in 2017 and gave \u00a350,000 to the party when David Cameron was prime minister.\n\u201cThe tempo has stepped up,\u201d Riddell said of the government\u2019s \u201crebalancing\u201d of the leadership of public bodies. \u201cUnder the [Theresa] May government, May was, as you would expect, rather correct and she was concerned with getting good people to do things. She was quite robust on that. Clearly things changed two years ago and there was more of a desire to shift the balance.\u201d\nHe said he had seen potential candidates with anti-Brexit views rooted out but declined to give examples, citing confidentiality. \u201cThere is a bit of a political litmus test being applied negatively as much as positively \u2026 People focus on X and Y [appointing] allies, but actually just as significant is blocking people.\u201d\nHe said the practice applied particularly to national museums and galleries \u201cwhere the arguments have been most intense\u201d.\nRiddell has previously warned that \u201csome at the centre of government want not only to have the final say but to tilt the competition system in their favour to appoint their allies\u201d. In his final report, published last month, he said ministerial restraint was \u201cclearly under threat in more politically polarised times\u201d. He said \u201cthis argues for reaffirming, and in some cases, strengthening the independent element in the appointments process\u201d.",

        "content": "A lot can happen in four years. A brand new competition can offer rugby players around England the opportunity to play at an elite level week after week. Twenty\u2011nine of them can quit their day job and focus entirely on their sport. A single team, still the only fully professional side in the world, can transform themselves into the most dominant outfit on the planet.\nThat is the condensed story of England\u2019s Red Roses. Beaten 41-32 in the 2017 World Cup final by New Zealand, they have now put 99 points on the current champions across two one-sided contests. The latest result, a battering at Franklin\u2019s Gardens, underlined a seismic shift in the global power balance.\nEverything England did throughout the 80 minutes was done at a higher tempo than the Black Ferns. Helena Rowland was blistering in the backline and brought 9,366 people to the edge of their seats every time she charged through a half-gap. Amy Cokayne scored a hat-trick but did so much more around the park, rampaging in the loose and marshalling a slick lineout and maul machine with unnerving proficiency. Stitching it all together was Zoe Harrison, the sort of fly-half whose cognitive reading of the game suggests she could bend spoons with her mind if she so desired.\nTo single out any individual though would not tell the full picture as the main driver of this rout was the England set-piece. At the scrum and in the maul the forwards were merciless, shoving with a unified hive mind against a Kiwi pack that looked disjointed by comparison.\nThe lineout, though, was something else. Surgical and flawless, it discouraged New Zealand from seeking touch on relieving kicks and served as a white totem of England\u2019s control. It also provided the opening try with Cokayne the beneficiary of a rumbling shunt inside New Zealand\u2019s five\u2011metre zone.\n\nHarlequins produced another of their spectacular second-half rallies to gain a third consecutive away win over Wasps.\nThe misfiring champions trailed 16-0 at the interval\u00a0 but it was one-way traffic afterwards as they picked up five points with a bonus-point 26-16 victory.\nLuke Northmore scored two tries for the visitors, with Tyrone Green and Scott Steele also crossing and Andre Esterhuizen adding three conversions. Wasps' points came from a Gabriel Oghre try and three penalties and a conversion from Jacob Umaga.\nHarlequins famously came from 28-0 down to beat Bristol in last season's play-off semi-finals and, in another example of their battling spirit, recently overturned a 21-point deficit to defeat the same opponents, and they were forced to dig deep again\nEllie Kildunne, omnipresent on attack and predictably safe under the high ball, scored the second shortly after which was set up near the right corner by Rowland\u2019s quick hands. A penalty try just after a quarter of an hour, the result of Kendra Cocksedge\u2019s knock-on which denied Lydia Thompson an easy score on the overlap, and Cokayne\u2019s second from a maul just before half\u2011time, meant England went into the break with a 28-0 lead that still belied their ascendency. Cokayne completed her hat-trick five minutes after the restart from another maul. Harrison again nailed the extras in a perfect performance from the tee.\nNew Zealand offered some fightback and Portia Woodman dotted down the best try of the match near the right touchline. It was just reward for an improvement at the breakdown and a rare period of blunder-free passing. It was not a sign of things to come. A howler at the lineout five metres from their own line saw the ball fall to Leanne Infante who scored the easiest try of her career.\nThe replacement full-back Sarah McKenna was shown a yellow card for obstructing New Zealand ball and the extra space in the wide channel was exploited by Stacey Fluhler that came about from neat work in midfield. On the evidence of this particular move one can\u2019t help but wonder what might have been if New Zealand\u2019s backline had seen more of the ball and had not appeared so rushed when they had it.\nReverting to basics, the substitute hooker Lark Davies motored over from close range after that lethal maul spluttered back into life. England\u2019s eighth was a departure as Abby Dow cantered home down the left from 40 metres out. New Zealand had the final say as Fluhler turned provider for Woodman\u2019s second, but it was barely a consolation.",

I wanted to make sure that that is my priority and it is. So everyone\u2019s clear about that. But it\u2019s just managing my time with the commitments around that. Even if it\u2019s not off-court events or whatever, I\u2019m still doing my WTA rookie hours for example.\u201d\nRaducanu, who has reached a career-high rank of 21 this week, will be the first seed in a WTA event for the first time in her career, a remarkable outcome in just her seventh tour main\u2011draw appearance. Simona Halep, the former world No 1, is the second seed. Raducanu has received a first-round bye and will face either Kateryna Kozlova or Wang Xinyu, both qualifiers, in her opening match.\nA week ago, Raducanu reached her first WTA tour quarter-final in Cluj-Napoca, where she was defeated convincingly by Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine. Raducanu said afterwards that she was fatigued after her life\u2011changing year. In Linz, she chose not to divulge any new information on her search for a new coach, noting that she is in \u201ca very good position with it\u201d and that her new coach will be with her when she travels to the Australian Open in January.\n\u201cI\u2019m here on my own and being my coach again this week, which I think is really good for me long-term. I\u2019m really feeling positive about my coaching situation. It\u2019s in a good place and yeah, I will have a coach in place in the Australian Open,\u201d said Raducanu, who is with her mother in Linz after her father accompanied her in Cluj.\nAs she competes in the final tournament of a whirlwind season, Raducanu reflected on how her life has changed over the past year. She had started the season with only A-levels on her mind and it was not until June that she started to compete and travel full time as a professional.\n\u201cOnly March the 18th was my first session on court in 2021,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so January, February, March I was literally just sat on my desk staring at a wall for nine hours a day. So I feel like where I am now I just need to really take it all in and enjoy because looking back at how far I\u2019ve come it\u2019s pretty surreal. I just really need to enjoy it because when I was in the beginning of year I would have never thought this was possible. I\u2019m kind of just really living in the moment right now I feel.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Andy Murray will be working with Esteban Carril, a former coach of Johanna Konta who recently trialled with Raducanu, at the Stockholm Open this week.",

Plus letters from David Mack and Douglas Mitchell\nHow disappointing and shortsighted of the Labour party to decide to stand in the North Shropshire byelection after the resignation of Owen Paterson rather than supporting a non-party, anti-sleaze candidate (Labour to stand in Shropshire byelection sparked by Owen Paterson resignation, 5 November). It was a chance to show that the Labour party was principled and more interested in probity in public life than party politics. The issue of sleaze and public concern about it would have gathered so much more momentum had there been a single opposition candidate. As it is, Labour is likely to lose \u2013 and even if it wins, the impact will be so much\u00a0less than it could have been.Aviva Le PrevostGroombridge, East Sussex\n I was one of three members expelled from the Labour party for trying to forge a cross-party progressive alliance in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s constituency in 2017 to send a message about his dreadful stewardship of the NHS over five years as health secretary. Now Labour is refusing to negotiate with Lib Dems and Greens to agree a cross-party candidate in the North Shropshire byelection. When will the Labour party learn two simple lessons: (1)\u00a0It\u00a0cannot win the next general election on its own and needs the support of other progressive parties \u2013 Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru; (2)\u00a0There is nothing shameful about working collaboratively with other progressive parties when faced with an extremist rightwing government elected on a minority of the vote, riddled with corruption \u2013 and which only wins elections because of our outdated and undemocratic electoral system.Steve WilliamsGodalming, Surrey\n I am enraged by the continual use of the word \u201csleaze\u201d in relation to this government\u2019s blatantly self-serving manoeuvres that show their contempt for democracy (Has Boris Johnson stooped low enough to make Tory voters turn?, 6 November). The word invokes images of Soho in the 1960s and Carry On films. It is not a serious word. The word we want is \u201ccorruption\u201d; a word readily used by the Guardian to describe regimes in Africa, the Middle East and South America, among other countries. Please stop diluting the seriousness of this government\u2019s behaviour by the use of a word that invokes images of sniggering schoolchildren. Corruption is what it is and how it needs to be named.Sue BrennanMartock, Somerset\n Tory backbenchers are now complaining about being herded through the lobbies last week, against their better judgment, even though a number of their colleagues had the backbone to stand up to the party whips (Newer Tory MPs furious at No 10 order to back Owen Paterson, 5 November). WS Gilbert had the measure of their ilk nearly 150 years ago, when he wrote in HMS Pinafore of Sir Joseph Porter\u2019s time as a member of parliament: \u201cI always voted at my party\u2019s call, And I never thought of\u00a0thinking\u00a0for\u00a0myself at all.\u201dDavid MackHeptonstall, West Yorkshire\n I hope the Conservative government does bestow a\u00a0peerage on Owen Paterson (No 10 declines to rule out potential peerage for Owen Paterson, 5 November), as it would\u00a0devalue the polluted \u201chonours\u201d system even further, if that\u2019s possible, but also cement this sleaze-ridden administration\u2019s reputation as the most corrupt since the era of the rotten boroughs.Douglas MitchellEdinburgh\n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Her family have now issued an emotional plea for pregnant women to get vaccinated.\nParveen, 37, had planned to delay having the jab until her baby was born, her family said, but she was admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties in September and put on a ventilator.\nA decision was taken by medical staff at Good Hope hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, to deliver the baby by emergency caesarean section. Parveen died on 1 November after spending five weeks in intensive care. She never got the chance to meet her newborn baby, her fifth daughter, named Dua Maryam.\nHer husband, Majid Ghafur, a 40-year-old taxi driver, is now caring for all five girls. He told Sky News: \u201cShe didn\u2019t even know if she\u2019d had a baby girl or a boy. It was just shocking. She didn\u2019t have a chance to talk to me, five minutes even, to tell me about the daughters, you know, what to do.\u201d\nAsked what her last words were, Gahfur said: \u201cShe couldn\u2019t even talk. She couldn\u2019t breathe properly \u2026 She couldn\u2019t talk.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m going to pass this message to the whole world, I just beg all people to get the vaccine, otherwise it\u2019s very hard for them. It\u2019s a very deadly disease, you know. She planned so many things, and this disease didn\u2019t give her a chance.\u201d\nParveen\u2019s brother Qayoum Mughal told the BBC his family had \u201clost everything\u201d. He described how his sister had received a letter offering the vaccine, but told her family: \u201cIt\u2019s too late now. When I\u2019ve had my baby, I will get my vaccine.\u201d\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t get the chance,\u201d he said.\nMughal described her as a \u201clady of principle\u201d and said: \u201cPlease, please, please get the vaccine, whether you are pregnant or not. For the sake of God and the sake of your loved ones, please get vaccinated \u2026 Save yourself and your loved ones.\u201d\nCovid vaccines are recommended for pregnant women. In a letter to midwives, obstetricians and GP practices in July, the chief midwife for England, Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, said all healthcare professionals had \u201ca responsibility to proactively encourage pregnant women\u201d to get vaccinated.\nParveen chose not to have the vaccine, but concerns have been raised that pregnant women are being turned away from vaccine clinics despite clinical advice.\nMembers of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation told the Guardian that they were urging ministers to focus more on pregnant women because only about 15% in the UK have been fully vaccinated. Among all over-12s, the figure is 79%.\nData from Oxford University\u2019s MBRRACE-UK study on maternal health shows that at least 13 pregnant women died with Covid between July and September this year, 85% of whom were believed to have been unvaccinated. That figure is higher than in the first and second waves of the pandemic, when nine and 11 pregnant women died but jabs were not available.\nProf Marian Knight, the lead for the MBRRACE-UK programme, said there was still no joined-up messaging across the health service. \u201cWomen are being turned away from clinics and now there are some trusts offering it as part of the maternity service, but it is not universal, so there are still barriers,\u201d she said.\nA funeral for Parveen is due to take place on Monday.",

Australia will lag behind the world if the government doesn\u2019t amp up spending in research and development. Emissions from land clearing are likely far higher than claimed. And it\u2019s only Monday, but if you\u2019re already looking forward to a beer at the pub this weekend, Sydney\u2019s historic Annandale Hotel \u2013 after a controversial journey \u2013 reopens this week.\nAustralia\u2019s emissions from land clearing are likely far higher than reported to the United Nations, new analysis indicates, sparking calls for an independent review of the sector. Researchers assessed satellite imagery of more than 50 properties in Queensland and found significant discrepancies between what is treated as cleared land by Australia\u2019s National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) and the Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) used by the state government. The Australian government has relied on its reporting of falls in land-clearing rates for almost all the reductions that allow it to claim the country\u2019s emissions have fallen by about one-fifth since 2005.\nThe country risks losing jobs to others if it fails to lift its below-average spending on research and development, a peak science body has warned, amid Scott Morrison\u2019s vow to promote \u201ctechnology not taxes\u201d on climate policy. Australia invests just 1.8% of its economic output in research and development, well behind the OECD average of 2.5%. Misha Schubert, chief executive of Science & Technology Australia, said Australia \u201cneeds to stay at the forefront of tech advances\u201d in areas including artificial intelligence and machine learning, clean energy technologies, and agricultural technologies or it \u201cwill lose jobs and opportunities to our competitors across the advanced economies of the world, in the OECD, and in our region\u201d.\nRapper Travis Scott said he was devastated after eight people died at his Astroworld music festival, ranging in age from 14 to 27.

Two teenagers who say they saw the incident called emergency services.\nAn assassination attempt using an exploding drone aimed at the Iraqi prime minister\u2019s house has failed to kill him, the government has said. Mustafa al-Kadhimi was reported to be unharmed after the drone hit his home in Baghdad\u2019s heavily fortified Green Zone, injuring seven security guards.

        "content": "West Ham are well organised, resilient and incisive, and even the London Stadium now feels like a football ground\nAs Pablo Fornals ran on to Jarrod Bowen\u2019s through-ball midway through the second half, the London Stadium fell into one of those pregnant silences that were probably the greatest loss of the time without fans. Over the course of what can only have been two or three seconds but felt far longer, you could almost hear the thought processes. First, was he going to get his shot in? Yes. Then, was he set to measure his finish? He was. Then, was his shot going to beat Alisson? It did, just about, carrying on into the net despite a hefty touch by the keeper.\nIs the London Stadium still disliked by West Ham fans? Perhaps it is. It is not, and never will be Upton Park, and there remains something deeply odd about having to edge past the Sunday afternoon shoppers in Westfield to get to a Premier League game. But in that moment, as anticipation became realisation became delight, the London Stadium felt like a football ground.\nAnd not just a football ground, but one that still cannot quite believe just how well everything is going.\nBut there was nothing fluky or freakish about a victory that took West Ham into third, above Liverpool in the table. Liverpool may have bossed possession, but West Ham were well organised and had a clear plan they executed superbly. David Moyes, after his disappointing stints at Manchester United, Sunderland and Real Sociedad, is thoroughly reinvigorated. That is a rare quality. Very few managers, once the slide has apparently begun, particularly after two decades in the job, have the clarity of thought to assess what they are doing, to look at best practice around Europe, and come back stronger and refreshed.\nYet at the same time, this West Ham is a side of discernibly Moyesian virtues. They are resilient. They are quite capable of sitting deep and absorbing pressure. They are well organised. In an ideal world they wouldn\u2019t let in two but then every side Liverpool had previously played away from home in the Premier League or Champions League this season had let in at least three. That said, if we\u2019re being critical, there was perhaps evidence here of the trait that more than anything else undermined his time at Sunderland, the habit of dropping deeper and deeper in the final minutes looking to hold what they have; Sadio Man\u00e9 very nearly nicked an equaliser with a low header in stoppage time.\nMost significantly, there is the capacity to make the most of what they have. There remains a sense in some quarters that set plays are somehow beneath the very best sides, an adjunct to the real business of holding possession and getting the positioning right. And yet as Gareth Southgate identified before the 2018 World Cup, getting the set plays right is a relatively low-cost way of adding value.\nAlisson\u2019s weakness dealing with inswinging corners was identified and ruthlessly exploited. Fornals\u2019s third-minute corner flicked the left thumb of the goalkeeper on its way in.\nLiverpool appealed desperately for a foul, but the contact with Angelo Ogbonna was initiated by the goalkeeper, who may be the same height as the Italian but shrank alongside him.\nAnd then, with 15 minutes remaining, it was an inswinger from Bowen that caught Alisson flat-footed as the ball dipped over him to be headed in at the back post by Kurt Zouma. That\u2019s six goals West Ham have now scored from set plays in their last six games; there is more than one way to win a football match.\nThe other goal was the result of West Ham\u2019s other strength: the surging counter-attack. Again, the targeted nature of the breaks was clear.\nIt\u2019s not just a case of whacking it up to Michail Antonio and seeing what happens, tireless though his running is. It\u2019s obvious to anybody that the forward sallies of Liverpool\u2019s full-backs, especially Trent Alexander-Arnold, leave space that can be exploited. Alexander-Arnold, again, was superb, scoring from a free-kick and setting up not only Divock Origi\u2019s goal but also two or three other very good chances \u2013 including that late Man\u00e9 miss. But he was also twice caught out by balls in behind him: towards the end of the first half when Antonio got the ball caught under his feet, and then 10 minutes into the second half, when Sa\u00efd Benrahma\u2019s charge was ended only by a tug on his arm that earned the full-back a yellow card.\nWest Ham have already guaranteed top spot in their Europa League group and they eliminated Manchester City to reach the last eight of the League Cup.\nOnly Brentford and Manchester United, with varying degrees of fortune, have beaten them this season. Their consistency across the three competitions has been extraordinary. How far could they go? The most exciting thing for West Ham is nobody quite knows.",

        "content": "Exultant in victory, Max Verstappen revelled in his success at the Mexican Grand Prix. He was clearly aware of the significance of the achievement. From third on the grid he beat Lewis Hamilton into second place and the win crashed with thunderous import across the championship, his joy surely informed by the knowledge that he has opened a 19-point lead that leaves Hamilton facing a huge challenge to overcome in the title fight, with only four more races to come.\nIn front of a capacity crowd of 140,000 at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez Verstappen definitively gave notice he has no intention of buckling under pressure in what is the tightest inter-team championship since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014.\nIn front after taking the lead at the opening corner, the 24-year-old delivered with the calm assurance of a veteran, rather than a young man in the first championship fight of his career. His Red Bull teammate, Sergio P\u00e9rez, finished third, becoming the first Mexican on the podium at his home race.\nThe race was far from a thriller with Verstappen unchallenged out in front and delivering another clinical performance of the kind that has defined much of his tilt for the title this season. It builds on the momentum he established with his victory at the US Grand Prix and, much as Mercedes and Hamilton had tried to take the fight to Red Bull on a track where they had expected to be under the cosh, they could not prevent another triumph for the Dutchman, who even dared to suggest, ominously, it had been almost a breeze.\n\u201cThere was incredible pace in the car so I could just do my own thing,\u201d a beaming Verstappen said. \u201cIt was quite straightforward today, which was really nice.\u201d\nHamilton conceded he knew he was facing a herculean endeavour to catch the Dutchman. \u201cWith their superior speed if they were to carry that into the next races we will be in trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel we need to be winning every race because we need those extra points but they are just too quick. We are giving it everything we have got but it\u2019s not enough at the moment to compete with them.\u201d\nThere was nothing Mercedes could do strategically in a straight one-stopper and where they were so comprehensively outpaced. Indeed Hamilton had to push hard at the close just to maintain second place from a charging P\u00e9rez. The result was this enthralling championship swinging very much Verstappen\u2019s way while Hamilton and Mercedes are running out of opportunities to turn it around.\nVerstappen had a 12-point lead on Hamilton going into the race and he and his Red Bull team were hopeful that, with favourable track and weather conditions, he might extend it to put clear daylight between him and the reigning champion. They did so with aplomb.\nThe lead is not yet unassailable but it is certainly intimidatingly large. It has swung between the two drivers all season and after 18 races predicting who will come out on top remains a foolhardy exercise. But Hamilton knows the scale of the task ahead, more clearly than ever after Red Bull exhibited the control that they did on Sunday.\nVerstappen\u2019s Red Bull team were expected to dominate in Mexico but, when Hamilton\u2019s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, and he took a one-two in qualifying, an upset from out of nowhere seemed suddenly on the cards. Yet Red Bull and Verstappen, with great race pace, were able to focus on delivering with the flawless execution they know will be required to take a title that may yet go to the wire. On Sunday his team managed to enjoy the advantage that had been expected on the circuit, which favours their engine and high-rake design, and Verstappen was ruthless with his tools.\nThe opening seconds were crucial, of course . At the off Verstappen took a slipstream from third on the grid behind the two Mercedes drivers. The Dutchman bravely braked late as they went wide, going round the outside to take the lead through turn one. It was a bold move handled with great finesse, deservedly putting him in front and decisive for the win.\nVerstappen held his lead after a safety car restart on lap five and promptly exploited it, opening a two-second gap by lap eight. He was putting in a series of repeatedly quick laps over the world champion and establishing a control he did not relinquish.\n\u201cThese guys are obviously too fast for us,\u201d Hamilton told his team on lap 24 as the reality of how strong Red Bull were became painfully clear.\nBy the time the leaders began their pitstops Verstappen was nine seconds in front as Hamilton came in on lap 30. With their only stops completed and a clear pace differential Verstappen was untouchable out front.\nOn rails he maintained the gap to Hamilton who could not dent the lead and had to focus on maintaining his place in front of P\u00e9rez who was enjoying fresher rubber through the closing stages. It was a tense 10 laps as Hamilton\u2019s car was overheating but he held on to claim second-place points.\nBottas took the fastest lap to deny Verstappen one extra point but the damage was done as the Dutchman closed out the race with cool authority, a full 16 seconds up the road against a rival impotent to challenge him. The fight is still on but Hamilton leaves Mexico with no doubt as to the scale of the task ahead.\nPierre Gasly was fourth for AlphaTauri with Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz in fifth and sixth for Ferrari. Sebastian Vettel was in seventh for Aston Martin, Kimi Raikkonen in eighth for Alfa Romeo. Fernando Alonso was ninth for Alpine and Lando Norris 10th for McLaren.",

        "content": "Jacksonville had the better Josh Allen on Sunday, with the standout linebacker intercepting a pass, making a sack and recovering a fumble in a 9-6 upset of the Buffalo Bills.\nHis namesake, the Buffalo quarterback, turned over the ball three times, including twice in the second half. He didn\u2019t have a second-half turnover in any previous game this season. The Bills (5-3) lost for the second time in seven games. The Jaguars (2-6) rebounded from a debacle at Seattle a week ago.\nJosh Allen interception. Josh Allen-ception? #BUFvsJAX | #DUUUVAL pic.twitter.com/Eb8OOEXCHA\nBuffalo\u2019s Allen completed 31 of 47 passes for 264 yards, with the two interceptions and a fumble.\nThe first of two deciding moments came on a third-and-two play at the Jaguars 37 with just over five minutes remaining. Allen fumbled after getting pressured by Dawuane Smoot. The other Josh Allen recovered. Buffalo got the ball back in the waning minutes and advanced to the Jaguars\u2019 39. But Smoot sacked Allen on third down. It was Jacksonville\u2019s fourth sack of the day. Allen got the first one.\nIt was the first time a player sacked a quarterback with the same name since the NFL started counting sacks in 1982.\nPatrick Mahomes threw for 166 yards and a touchdown, Kansas City relentlessly blitzed the Packers\u2019 Jordan Love in his highly anticipated first start in place of Aaron Rodgers, and the Chiefs held off Green Bay 13-7.\nRodgers tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week, forcing the reigning MVP to miss his first game since the 2017 season. Love responded by going 19 of 34 for 190 yards with a touchdown and an interception, both of them coming in the fourth quarter when the Packers were trying to rally from a 13-0 deficit against the defending AFC champs.\nBaker Mayfield threw two touchdown passes, Nick Chubb ran for 137 yards and the Cleveland Browns, sparked by cornerback Denzel Ward\u2019s early 99-yard interception return for a TD, capped a chaotic week by smashing Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals.\nThe Browns (5-4) came in desperate for a win after dropping three of four. Their situation turned dramatic on Wednesday when star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr was exiled for poor behavior and the team decided to release him.\nBut like last year, when Mayfield played more freely after Beckham suffered a season-ending knee injury, Cleveland\u2019s QB was on target and the Browns put together their most complete game this season to humble the Bengals (5-4), who hurt themselves with mistakes as they dropped their second straight.\nJustin Herbert threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score, and Dustin Hopkins kicked a 29-yard field goal with two seconds remaining, leading the Los Angeles Chargers to a 27-24 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.\nHerbert threw for 356 yards, completing 32 of 38 passes. He got one-yard on a sneak on fourth-and-one from the Eagles 28 with 1:45 left, setting up Hopkins\u2019 kick. The Chargers (5-3) snapped a two-game losing streak. The Eagles (3-6) still haven\u2019t won a home game in four tries under rookie coach Nick Sirianni.\nJames Conner ran for two touchdowns and caught a 45-yard TD pass from backup quarterback Colt McCoy as the short-handed Arizona Cardinals beat the San Francisco 49ers.\nThe Cardinals (8-1) were playing without quarterback Kyler Murray and receivers DeAndre Hopkins and AJ Green but still had little trouble completing the season sweep against the 49ers (3-5). Conner scored on TD runs on back-to-back drives in the first quarter to stake the Cardinals to a big lead they never relinquished. Conner\u2019s long catch-and-run TD on Arizona\u2019s first drive of the second half helped put the game out of reach.\nTeddy Bridgewater threw for a touchdown and had a sneak for another, and the Denver Broncos stymied the NFL\u2019s No 1 offense when it mattered in a 30-16 victory over Dallas, ending the Cowboys\u2019 six-game winning streak.\nDak Prescott returned after missing a game with a strained right calf but couldn\u2019t get the Cowboys (6-2) moving until two meaningless late touchdowns that merely avoided what would have been their worst shutout loss at home since 1985.\nMac Jones overcame two early turnovers and threw for 139 yards and a touchdown, JC Jackson returned one of three Sam Darnold interceptions for an 88-yard touchdown and the New England Patriots defeated the Carolina Panthers for their fourth win in the past five games.\nRookie running back Rhamondre Stevenson had 106 yards from scrimmage before leaving the game with a head injury and Damien Harris and Hunter Henry scored touchdowns as the Patriots (5-4) improved to 4-0 on the road.\nDarnold had another miserable outing for Carolina. He finished 16 of 33 for 172 yards with three picks, two of them by Jackson after the Panthers (4-5) reached the red zone. Darnold has been intercepted nine times and thrown only one touchdown in four career games against the Bill Belichick-coached Patriots.\nJustin Tucker kicked a 36-yard field goal with 16 seconds left in overtime to give the Baltimore Ravens a 34-31 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.\nThe AFC North-leading Ravens (6-2) rallied from a 14-point third-quarter deficit and survived an acrobatic interception by Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Barr on the first possession of overtime. Barr tipped Lamar Jackson\u2019s pass and caught it out of the air, giving the Vikings the ball at their own 38, but Minnesota went three-and-out, and Baltimore drove into Tucker\u2019s range again.\nXavier McKinney returned an interception 41 yards for a touchdown early in the second half and picked off another errant throw by Derek Carr late as the New York Giants added to the Raiders\u2019 post-bye woes with a 23-16 victory over Las Vegas.\nDaniel Jones threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram and Graham Gano added three field goals the last after McKinney\u2019s second pick for New York (3-6). Filling in for the injured Saquon Barkley, former Raider Devontae Booker ran for 99 yards before leaving late with a hip injury.\nMatt Ryan hit Cordarrelle Patterson for a 64-yard gain with a minute to go, setting up Younghoe Koo\u2019s 29-yard field goal as time expired, and the Atlanta Falcons defeated the mistake-prone New Orleans Saints.\nRyan passed for 343 yards, connected twice with Olamide Zaccheaus for touchdowns, and the veteran quarterback also ran for a score on a bootleg. Ryan\u2019s second scoring pass gave the Falcons a 24-6 lead with 10:39 left in the fourth quarter. But the Saints rallied to briefly take the lead on Trevor Siemian\u2019s eight-yard pass to Kenny Stills with 1:01 left. New Orleans then missed a two-point conversion try for the second time in the game, leaving the door open for the Falcons.\nIn the NFL\u2019s most turnover-filled game in more than five seasons, the Miami Dolphins got 244 yards passing and a touchdown throw from surprise starter Jacoby Brissett on the way to beating the Houston Texans.\nThe game between two teams that entered with 1-7 records and both on seven-game losing streaks lived up or down to its billing. The Dolphins and Texans combined for nine turnovers. Miami had five, Houston four, and somehow the Dolphins (2-7) won anyway.",

The criminals behind these cowardly and reckless attacks have done nothing more than harm their local community, depriving them of a critical public service.\u201d\nA police spokesperson said Church Road had been closed and asked members of the public to avoid the area, adding: \u201cIt was reported that four men got on to the bus and ordered passengers off before the bus was then set alight.\u201d\nThe divisions in Northern Ireland have long been along political lines about how it should be governed, and by whom, and also along religious faultlines.\nUnionists, also called loyalists, are loyal to the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Historically they have mostly been Protestants, and often refer to the area of Northern Ireland as Ulster \u2013 one of Ireland\u2019s traditional provinces whose territory it partially covers.\nRepublicans, also called nationalists, believe in a united and independent Ireland. Historically they have mostly been Catholic. They sometimes refer to Northern Ireland as the \"six counties\", a reference to the fact that the territory covers six of the nine counties of Ulster.\nThe two communities tend to vote along separate lines, with parties such as the Democratic Unionist party and the Ulster Unionist party attracting the support of loyalists, while nationalists usually voting for the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) or for Sinn F\u00e9in. The Alliance party and the Green party attract some cross-community support.\nPrior to the relative peace and stability brought about by the Good Friday agreement in 1998, there were decades of conflict centred around Northern Ireland known colloquially as \"the Troubles\", fuelled by paramilitary wings on both sides of the divide.\nOrganisations including the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) fought for the nationalist cause, and on the opposite side groups such as the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) between them perpetuated conflict that included terrorist attacks and murders in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain as well as in Northern Ireland itself. About 3,500 people were killed during this period, including those killed by British security forces.\nThe roots of the conflict, however, go back to the 12th century invasions of Ireland by forces from Great Britain. Echoes of that long history are seen in the symbols used and events celebrated by either side. Loyalists celebrate with their Orange Order marches the 1690 victory of Protestant Prince William of Orange over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne, while republicans celebrate events such as the 1916 Easter Rising, which paved the way for the formation of the modern independent Republic of Ireland.\nBrexit has recently exacerbated divisions, making the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland a land border between the EU and the UK, and a source of tension between the two trading blocs over their future relationship. The DUP and other unionists campaigned for Brexit, while Sinn F\u00e9in and other republicans campaigned against it. Northern Ireland voted overall to remain in the EU, by 55.8% to 44.2%.\nViolence also broke out twice last week in west Belfast between youths from the nationalist Springfield Road and loyalist Shankill Road.\nFollowing a protest against the Northern Ireland protocol, police were attacked with missiles and fireworks on Wednesday and Friday night.",

The scientists also discovered a \u201clight\u201d pair of black holes with a combined mass only 18 times that of the sun.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nTwo of the 35 detections are believed to have originated from a neutron star merging with a black hole.\nNeutron stars are small, incredibly dense objects: although they weigh around 1.4 times the mass of the sun, they are city-sized, with a radius of approximately 15km, said research collaborator Prof Susan Scott, of the Australian National University.\nScott said the detections were helping scientists understand both the evolution of the universe and also the nature of stellar objects.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nThe number of recent detections were up tenfold from when the Ligo and Virgo instruments first started observing for gravitational waves, Scott said. She attributed the increase to upgrades in the detecting instruments, such as an improvement in laser power.\n\u201cEventually as we make the detectors even more sensitive, we\u2019ll be able to see all the binary black hole pairs coming together throughout the whole universe,\u201d Scott said.\n\u201cNeutron stars when they collide \u2013 they don\u2019t create as strong gravitational waves as the black holes because they\u2019re not as dense, and therefore we can\u2019t see them out as far.\u201d\nIn future, astronomers may also be able to detect gravitational waves from stars as they become supernovae. \u201cThis would help us to understand the process of stars when they finish their life cycle and run out of fuel and blow up and then collapse,\u201d Scott said.\nAnalysing certain properties of the mergers allowed scientists to determine how they were formed, Galaudage said.\n\u201cBy looking at how a black hole is spinning, for example \u2013 how fast it\u2019s spinning, versus \u2026 which way it\u2019s pointed \u2013 can tell us more about how it came to be: whether these black holes lived their lives apart and met at some point or whether they were stars to begin with, and then collapsed down [separately] to form black holes, and then went on to merge and produce these gravitational waves,\u201d she said.\nSome of the new detections are still mysterious. The researchers believe the 35th event could be either a pair of black holes, or a merger between a black hole and a neutron star.\nThe lighter object in this event had a mass greater than would be usual for a neutron star, but smaller than that of a black hole. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing features \u2026 that we cannot explain yet,\u201d Galaudage said.",

The film\u2019s take on the western is a chance to squarely point a bullet right between the eyes of the whitewashed Australian outback fable.\nIt\u2019s 1893, and up high in the New South Wales Snowy Mountains lives heavily pregnant Molly (as well as starring as the hardened bushwoman, Purcell wrote and directed the film) in a shoddy hut with her four young children. Her husband Joe is often away for months droving sheep, but Molly is fiercely protective in his absence: at the first sign of a threat she\u2019s in front of her hut, gun cocked.\nThis is the third time Purcell has adapted Lawson\u2019s colonial classic about a nameless wife waiting, against the harsh frontier of the Australian bushland, with her dog \u201cAlligator\u201d for her husband to return. It follows on from her award-winning 2016 Belvoir Street Theatre play and subsequent 2019 novel of the same name. In rewriting Lawson\u2019s colonial classic, Purcell was inspired by her own lived experiences and ancestral history, and she has used the original story as a basis for her own clear-eyed reimagining through an Indigenous feminist lens. In this third \u2013 cinematic \u2013 incarnation, Purcell\u2019s supreme acting takes centre stage (the weary flickers of her facial expressions clue us into the deep anguish of Molly\u2019s past), and while the adaptation is ambitious, it is at times tonally misguided.\nAs in all three of Purcell\u2019s adaptions, she has fleshed out the existing characters from Lawson\u2019s story and created new ones along the way \u2013 with varying results. There\u2019s the introduction of Louisa (Jessica De Gouw), the London-bred wife of a new lawmaker Sergeant Nate Clintoff (Sam Reid), who writes in the town\u2019s magazine on \u201cbattered women\u2019s\u201d rights; and a fugitive Aboriginal man, Yadaka (Rob Collins), who stumbles on to Molly\u2019s farm, a character fleetingly painted in Lawson\u2019s prose as a deceptive, silly figure, but in Purcell\u2019s script plays a pivotal, hero-like role to the Johnson family.\nAs in Warwick Thornton\u2019s 2017 film Sweet Country and Jennifer Kent\u2019s 2019 The Nightingale, Purcell\u2019s revisionist period drama is unflinching in depicting the harsh realities of justice for Indigenous people in the late 19th century. Purcell\u2019s version leaves few notes of subtlety to decipher Molly\u2019s brutal struggles in this dry bush environment, foregrounding issues of small-town racism and domestic violence with a searing, albeit heavy-handed, touch.\nThe relationship between Yadaka and Molly is the film\u2019s most moving, as the pair slowly gain each another\u2019s trust: she uneasily removes his neck shackle, and later he reveals knowledge about her blood lineage that opens up the truth of her cultural identity.\nWith the film\u2019s visual metaphors and inclination to veer towards melodrama, it\u2019s easy to picture Purcell\u2019s story working more successfully on stage, or  through first-person reflections in its novel format. The screen adaptation is stunning in visual scale, but doesn\u2019t quite locate the fine balance needed to juggle the theatricality of the drama and the action-packed tropes of the western thriller.\nThe underdeveloped storylines barrel towards a rushed third act, as the rousing suspicions increase around the mysterious disappearance of Molly\u2019s husband, and Nate opens up an investigation into the murder of a neighbouring drover and wife. The secondary drama unfolding in the rural town of Everton, which involves Louisa\u2019s progressive politics on women\u2019s rights and Nate\u2019s gradual villainous turn, aren\u2019t afforded the proper time to deftly intertwine with Molly\u2019s plight for survival in the mountains.\nPurcell\u2019s directorial grasp is much more confident in the overall look of the film, rendering it a majestic cinematic quality against the story\u2019s intensifying violence. Cinematographer Mark Wareham indulges in the romantic backdrop of the Australian alpine ranges and never-ending skylines, switching comfortably to capture the stuffy, smoky interiors of Everton. Salliana Seven Campbell\u2019s jangly piano and violin-dominant score often intrudes over the film\u2019s quieter moments, but is more effective in adding sweeping scope to the imagery, while providing a lumbering menace to the threats coming Molly\u2019s way.\nBut it\u2019s Purcell\u2019s powerhouse performance that lends the film its punchier, gritty edge. In the press notes, the writer-director-actor muses on the film having its \u201cown Songline\u201d \u2013 with her spiritual force passing down the stories and cultural practice of ancient traditions. Although the screen adaptation doesn\u2019t always hit the mark, Purcell has now completed the \u201ctrilogy\u201d of The Drover\u2019s Wife with vigour, and in turn has reclaimed Molly Johnson as her own.\nThe Drover\u2019s Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson screened at the Sydney film festival and is released in the UK on 13 May.",

There are no international visitors to fill tables during the week, let alone to make up for a difficult three months of forced shutdown during the summer outbreak of Covid.\nShe says the business has also been affected by supply chain issues \u2013 a knock-on effect of the pandemic \u2013 and has been unable to buy basics such as mayonnaise or tortillas. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2013 I haven\u2019t found it in three months.\u201d\nThe scene sums up the mixed fortunes of Taiwan, as the rest of the world opens up but the island remains firmly closed.\nFor the first 18 months of the coronavirus pandemic, life in Taiwan was blessed. As cities locked down across China, Europe and Asia, and death tolls climbed into the millions, Taiwan was safe, vibrant, almost normal.\nThanks to a strategy of case prevention and swift elimination, it recorded a relatively low 16,430 cases \u2013 mostly imported and detected in quarantine \u2013 and 847 deaths.\nBut now, as the world begins opening up, having accepted coexistence with the virus while mitigating it with high vaccination rates and other measures, Taiwan risks being left behind.\nAlmost two years after Covid first emerged, the island has held tight to the measures that made it an early success \u2013 closed borders, strict quarantine, intensive case tracing and widespread mandatory mask-wearing. And there is little sign of these requirements ending.\nThe island is now among a few holdouts \u2013 alongside China and Hong Kong \u2013 that are resisting rejoining the post-Covid world and wrestling with what that means for the economy and the public.\nThe restricted borders have crushed international tourism, hindered trade and exacerbated supply chain issues. Airmail services to and from several countries are suspended. Families have been separated, livelihoods hurt.\nThroughout the pandemic tourists and other non-residents have been banned from entry, including the foreign partners and children of Taiwan residents. Authorities recently lifted the ban, but it only applied to the families of Taiwanese citizens, not foreign residents.\n\u201cBeing unable to be with the one you love is really, really hard,\u201d said French national, Clement Potier, whose partner is stuck overseas. The partial lift was even harder to swallow, he told local media, because \u201cyou see that it could be possible, but not for you\u201d.\nIn 2019 there were more than 29 million international arrivals in Taiwan. In 2020, during the height of the pandemic and prior to vaccines, the figure dropped to 3.9 million. So far this year there have been just 335,000.\n\u201cHow long can you maintain it? There\u2019s a price for it,\u201d says Prof Chunhuei Chi, the director of Oregon State University\u2019s centre for global health. \u201cTaiwan sacrificed international collaboration in commerce and exchange.\u201d\nIn July, the Economist Intelligence Unit said the Zero Covid approach used in Asian countries \u201chas delivered both health and economic benefits, and has been popular where implemented\u201d.\n\u201cIf the rest of the world had adopted a similar approach, zero\u2011Covid might prove a sustainable strategy,\u201d it said. But they hadn\u2019t, and the policy \u201cwill become unviable as the global economy reopens\u201d, the report found.\nSome Taiwan-based businesses relying on the global market have begun looking at moving manufacturing on the island, given there is no indication when the problems will ease, because there is no clear roadmap being presented to residents.\nCurrently all entrants must quarantine in designated hotels or government facilities, and then spend another week \u201cself managing\u201d limited isolation. Home quarantine ended after it was linked to Taiwan\u2019s only significant Delta outbreak in Pingtung county, and observers don\u2019t see it returning soon.\nA primary factor in Taiwan\u2019s continued closure is its struggle to match international vaccination rates, especially in second doses. A drive to deliver Moderna doses to some sector workers saw delivery of second shots, which are recommended at 28 days by the WHO, delayed to at least 12 weeks, with some recipients forced to cold-call hospitals around Taiwan looking for doses.\nA combination of under-ordered supplies, global shortages, and foreign interference by China, means Taiwan\u2019s vaccination program has been largely propped up by significant but inconsistent donations, and lately its own domestically developed vaccine.\nAbout 73% of people in Taiwan had received at least one dose \u2013 with the highest proportions among the elderly \u2013 and just over one-third has received their second dose. The government says it\u2019s on track to meet its 60% target by year\u2019s end, when they will consider unspecified future changes.\nPolitics is also a factor, says Prof Chi. With local elections on the horizon, Chi predicts the DPP will wait to open borders because of the high chance any outbreak will be used by the opposition KMT to criticise the government.\n\u201cIt cannot afford any new outbreak,\u201d he says.\nIn September the central epidemic command centre (CECC) told the Guardian Covid Zero was not its target but they were heading in that direction. Asked in parliament last month if their plan was for Covid zero or coexistence, health minister Chen Shih-chung appeared to say both.\n\u201cThe current goal is to achieve Covid-19 zero, but Taiwan must also be prepared to coexist with Covid-19,\u201d he said, suggesting they were hoping the virus eventually lessened in severity.\nIn October, special adviser to the CECC, professor Lee Ping-ing, appeared to suggest that would take three years. \u201cWe must wait until the virus becomes mild and the human immune system can adjust before it can start coexisting with the virus,\u201d he said.\nObservers note readying the public is a key issue for the short term if Taiwan is to open up, in order to address strong fear and significant stigma attached to infections.\n\u201cEven if Taiwan had 70% of the population who received two doses, it is still worrying to think of opening up,\u201d said one resident on Taiwan\u2019s social media platform PTT, saying other countries have become accustomed to the pandemic.\n\u201cTaiwanese are afraid of death and opening after vaccination. They still hesitate.\u201d\nProf Steve Tsang, of the SOAS Institute, said he understands why the government is going slow, \u201cbut it will have to accept that we will have to live with Covid now, and the Zero Covid policy is not sustainable\u201d.\n\u201cIt may well need more time to increase the rate of vaccination before it can relax substantially the travel restrictions, but it should provide clear guidelines on the criteria for doing so.\u201d",

        "content": "Australia were frustrated at times by referee Romain Poite, but they only had themselves to blame for the loss at Murrayfield\nAustralia did not get the same impact from their French foreign legion as their Japan-based teammates in their defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield, but the Wallabies should persevere with overseas selections.\nWith Quade Cooper, Samu Kerevi and Sean McMahon \u201cdefecting\u201d, in coach Dave Rennie\u2019s language, to rejoin their Japanese clubs, France-based second-rowers Rory Arnold and Will Skelton and utility back Kurtley Beale were included for the three-Test tour of Britain.\nCooper and Kerevi, in particular, were influential in the Wallabies\u2019 success against South Africa and Argentina in the Rugby Championship, but Arnold, Skelton and Beale could not help Australia avoid a third-straight loss to the Scots, which snapped Australia\u2019s five-game winning streak.\nArnold, who started the match, was a commanding presence in the lineout, which had been an area of concern for the Wallabies, but he was relatively quiet in general play, although he was more involved as the game progressed.\nSkelton replaced Arnold in the 50th minute with the Wallabies leading 10-7 after trailing 7-3 at half-time. While Skelton made a few strong ball carries and was busy around the ruck and maul, he did not deliver any of his trademark offloads, which could have sparked the Wallabies\u2019 attack.\nBut Skelton did make his considerable presence felt in one crucial area \u2013 the scrum. By the time Skelton entered the game, the Wallabies had conceded four scrum penalties to one, their set-piece badly disrupted by the loss of their two tight-head props Allan Alaalatoa (sin bin) and Taniela Tupou (head bin).\nThey were forced to play veteran loose-head prop James Slipper at tight-head and rookie Angus Bell at loose-head until Alaalatoa returned to the field, but they were under pressure on both sides of the scrum.\nTrailing by three points midway through the second-half, Scotland passed up two potentially equalising shots at penalty goals to opt for five metre scrums, leading to replacement hooker Ewan Ashman\u2019s acrobatic try in the left corner in the 58th minute.\nBut with the 140kg Skelton pushing in the second-row the Wallabies forced Scotland\u2019s scrum to collapse in the 74th minute and received a penalty.\nWith the strong-scrummaging Tupou in doubt for the Wallabies\u2019 Test against England on Sunday morning (Australian time), Rennie must seriously consider starting Skelton to prevent Australia\u2019s scrum from being smashed.\nBeale came on at fullback in the 66th minute with Andrew Kellaway moving to the wing to replace the substituted Tom Wright. The Wallabies led 13-12. With his first touch Beale took a high ball and beat two defenders, looking like the \u201cexcitement machine\u201d of old.\nBut he committed two errors which marred his game \u2013 when he was held up in a tackle by the Scottish backrow in the 72nd minute, giving Scotland a scrum feed and then when he kicked the ball out on the full in the 78th minute to gift the Scots a lineout 23 metres from the Australian line, enabling them to close out the game.\nThe Wallabies should have had the game completely under control well before Skelton and Beale came onto the field, but undermined themselves with ill-discipline and lack of accuracy.\nWhile the Australians were frustrated by some of French referee Romain Poite\u2019s interpretations, they only had themselves to blame for the loss.\nIn the opening minute outside-centre Len Ikitau needlessly flicked a reverse pass in Scotland\u2019s 22 which ended up in Scottish hands, setting the tone for a looseness in the Wallabies\u2019 play.\nIt was just one of a number of missed opportunities. Inside-centre Hunter Paisami was penalised for an extra roll after being tackled just short in the Scottish line; Wright was over the try-line, but called back after Paisami was penalised for an illegal clean-out; and Alaalatoa was yellow-carded for clumsily connecting with Scotland number eight Matt Fagerson\u2019s head in a clean-out just metres from the try-line.\nThe Wallabies should have had more than 20 points on the scoreboard at half-time, but left them on the field.\nBoth teams attempted to play an expansive, up tempo game, but without Cooper and Kerevi, the Wallabies\u2019 attack lacked cohesion and penetration and they struggled to utilise the width of the field in attack. Winger Jordan Petaia did not receive his first touch of the ball until the 38th minute and then went off after being injured in the tackle.\nAs was the case earlier in the international season, the Wallabies seemed betwixt between when to run the ball and when to kick it. A perfect, or perhaps imperfect, example was when the Wallabies were in possession just outside their 22 midway through the first-half.\nUnder instructions to play for field position, five-eighth James O\u2019Connor kicked down field seemingly unaware that the Wallabies had seven attacking players on two defenders on his right hand side. It is important to execute the game-plan, but it is equally vital to see and take opportunities when they arise.\nIt was the Wallabies\u2019 seventh straight loss against British and Irish opposition. The Australians will need to improve markedly when they play England or Eddie Jones\u2019s men will make sure they have an unsuccessful tour.",

Australia has a constitution for a good reason, we\u2019re a democracy, we should be able to travel freely.\u201d\nTurner said he\u2019d been contemplating a legal course of action for \u201csome time\u201d but had been waiting for Western Australia to announce its reopening plan before deciding the \u201cbest course\u201d.\nUnder premier Mark McGowan\u2019s transition plan, the border will remain closed until at least late January, when 90% of people aged 12 and above are vaccinated. McGowan has said the threshold, which depends on a further 250,000 West Australians getting vaccinated, will save 200 lives.\nTurner said his legal team would have a greater chance of success than billionaire Clive Palmer\u2019s failed high court challenge, which attempted to draw upon section 92 of the constitution to argue interstate movement should be \u201cabsolutely free\u201d.\nLast year, the court unanimously agreed the border policy was not discriminatory and was justified by the level of risk associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTurner said his challenge would be \u201cdifferent to the Palmer case\u201d as he would lead a judicial review in federal court to prove the border directions were unreasonable, and circumstances had changed since the vaccination rollout.\n\u201cWe have other backers in travel and tourism ... and we believe we can act along to get things moving. The state has to open some time, whether it\u2019s 80% or 90% that doesn\u2019t make a difference, and our experts will be able to show that,\u201d he said.\nWest Australian branch of the Australian Medical Association president, Mark Duncan-Smith, said if Flight Centre were to take legal action against the Western Australian government, he would \u201cnever [step] foot in another store again\u201d.\n\u201cThe threats constitute a company that has a focus on profits and not people, and would damage their business reputation in Western Australia immeasurably,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe arrogance that the people who run Flight Centre think they know better than the government, when they have all the modelling, is to me unbelievable \u2026 they need to pull their head in.\nDuncan-Smith said while there could be some \u201cnuances\u201d with respect to the state\u2019s reopening, he was broadly supportive of the West Australian government\u2019s roadmap.\n\u201cWe would see excessive disease and deaths from opening at 70% or 80% \u2026 and that\u2019s consistent with ANU and UWA modelling which showed, aspiration-wise, you should only open up at 90%,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have the lowest number of public hospital and intensive care beds of any state or territory, a medical system with no reserves. We will be more easily overrun than New South Wales or Victoria, who are already tinkering on the edge of being overrun.\n\u201cThe fewer cases we get the better, hundreds of cases a day, not thousands or our medical system would be overrun.\u201d\nWhile the Doherty Institute\u2019s modelling is based on vaccination targets of 16-year-olds and above, Western Australia\u2019s reopening requires 90% of people aged 12 and over to be vaccinated before reopening.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a single community death, we\u2019re effectively Covid free \u2026 things are booming,\u201d Duncan-Smith said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re inviting a killer disease into the state. Of course we have to eventually, but we\u2019re going from completely normal life to restrictions, that has to be understood.\u201d\nMcGowan said he acknowledged some people would be \u201cfrustrated\u201d they wouldn\u2019t be able to reunite with family over Christmas.\n\u201cBut as difficult as it is, it\u2019s for the right reasons,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe difference in easing border controls at 90% rather than 80% is 200 West Australian lives are saved.\u201d",

The hub was specifically opened for some of the city\u2019s most disadvantaged residents.\nOf those who used the hub, 51% were aged in their 20s or 30s, reflecting the high numbers of international students, Bartholomeusz said. Overall, 61% of people did not have a Medicare Card.\nAbout 5% were born in Australia, but did not have Medicare cards, and were likely homeless or experiencing severe disadvantage. The top five countries by birth were China, Australia, Colombia, India and Vietnam. The top three preferred languages other than English were Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish, with 33% of those vaccinated at the hub having a preferred language other than English.\n\u201cThere has been an overwhelming uptake from culturally and linguistically diverse communities to access the vaccine which shows that providing a culturally safe offering combined with our community engagement approach works,\u201d Bartholomeusz said.\nShe said now that the vaccination centre had hit the target of reaching vulnerable community members in the city, it is offering vaccination more widely.\n\u201cThe vaccination centre has hit the target in reaching vulnerable community members in the CBD, and we\u2019re excited to be opening the doors even wider as the city opens back up,\u201d she said.\nFrom Tuesday the vaccination centre will be open to anyone who lives in, works in or visits the city, with extended hours to catch people after work. It will be open from Monday to Friday between 10am and 6pm with walk-ins and appointments available.\n\u201cAs workers return to the city and the shops get busier in the lead-up to Christmas, we hope to offer a convenient and welcoming health space for people who want to drop in and get their first or second jab,\u201d Bartholomeusz said.\nMelbourne lord mayor, Sally Capp, said she hoped expanding the reach of the vaccination centre would help Melbourne reopen safely, and sooner.\n\u201cWe want to bring the buzz back to Melbourne and support our city business owners, and the best way we can do that is by hitting Victoria\u2019s vaccination targets,\u201d Capp said.\nAs of Monday, 92.6% of Victorians aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 84.1% have had two doses.

        "content": "Communities and groups say being shut out of key negotiations will have dire consequences for millions\nThe legitimacy of the Cop26 climate summit has been called into question by civil society participants who say restrictions on access to negotiations are unprecedented and unjust.\nAs the Glasgow summit enters its second week, observers representing hundreds of environmental, academic, climate justice, indigenous and women\u2019s rights organisations warn that excluding them from negotiating areas and speaking to negotiators could have dire consequences for millions of people.\nObservers act as informal watchdogs of the summit \u2013 the eyes and ears of the public during negotiations to ensure proceedings are transparent and reflect the concerns of communities and groups most likely to be affected by decisions.\nBut their ability to observe, interact and intervene in negotiations on carbon markets, loss and damage and climate financing has been obstructed during the first week, the Guardian has been told.\n\u201cCivil society voices are critical to the outcome of Cop, but we\u2019ve not been able to do our jobs. If participation and inclusion are the measure of legitimacy, then we\u2019re on very shaky grounds,\u201d said Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network (CAN), which represents more than 1,500 organisations in over 130 countries.\nCAN is one of two environmental \u201cconstituencies\u201d \u2013 loose networks of NGOs including youth groups, trade unions, indigenous peoples, business, agriculture, and gender \u2013 recognised by the UNFCCC.\nGina Cortes, a member of the Women and Gender Constituency, representing women\u2019s groups, said they also had to \u201ccall out the deep inequities and deep injustices of this Cop\u201d.\n\u201cThere are thousands of activists who should be here but who are missing and there is a shocking degree of closing space for civil society and frontline voices \u2026 it is offensive, unjust and unacceptable,\u201d said Cortes.\nIn the run-up to Cop26, the UK government had boasted that Glasgow would be the most inclusive summit on record.\nIn reality, about two-thirds of civil society organisations who usually send delegates to Cop have not travelled to Glasgow due to \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d, changing travel rules, extortionate travel costs and Britain\u2019s hostile immigration system.\nObservers say the situation was most critical during the two-day leaders\u2019 summit at the start of last week, when they were limited to one or two tickets per constituency despite six negotiating rooms operating simultaneously. In addition, work stations, offices and restaurants were also cordoned off, preventing observers from having face-to-face contact with negotiators.\n\u201cThe level of restrictions was unprecedented,\u201d said Sebastian Duyck, from the Centre for International Environmental Law. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming, because the relationships we build at the start of Cop are crucial to the work we do after \u2026 the limited participation absolutely undermines the credibility of Cop.\u201d\nAccess has improved since the ticketing system was lifted, with one observer per constituency now technically allowed in each meeting room \u2013 if there\u2019s enough spaceaccording to social distancing rules. But their ability to participate meaningfully remains limited.\nObservers are particularly concerned about negotiations over carbon trading protocols, as governments and corporations look for ways to achieve net zero commitments using offsets.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that decisions made in these rooms will impact human rights in the most dramatic fashion, like we saw happen under the carbon trading mechanism under Kyoto. If we get a bad rule, it\u2019s almost impossible to fix afterwards. The scale of carbon markets means there\u2019s a greater threat to communities,\u201d said Duyck.\nThis is a huge worry for indigenous communities, who comprise 6% of the global population but protect 80% of the planet\u2019s biodiversity. \u201cWithout our voices this risks the creation of rules that will continue to violate human, territorial and spiritual rights of Indigenous Peoples,\u201d said Eriel Deranger, an observer for Indigenous Climate Action.\nThe UK government points to the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic, and says access has been boosted by the new online platform that has so far been used by 12,000 people.\nBut for some, trying to follow what\u2019s going on virtually, technical glitches have made access a \u201clogistical nightmare\u201d, said Hellen Kaneni, regional Africa coordinator for the international nonprofit Corporate Accountability. \u201cCop has never been credible but this year it\u2019s much worse, access has been limited in so many ways, it\u2019s horrible.\u201d\nAderonke Ige from Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, who made it to Glasgow from Nigeria for her first Cop despite the Covid restrictions, said she felt \u201cdisappointed and unfulfilled\u201d after failing to get online and being denied access to the meeting rooms and offices of the African group negotiators.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is committed to hosting an inclusive Cop. Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority for the Cop26 presidency, and if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to continue demonstrating their ideas and ambition in Glasgow.\u201d\nThe success of this Cop will be judged over years to come. But according to Nathan Thanki from Demand Climate Justice (the second environmental constituency), the summit\u2019s legitimacy had been seriously undermined by restrictions in access and the way rich countries had used Cop26 to make headline-grabbing announcements outside the UNFCCC\u2019s pledge and review framework.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to monitor these announcements, which means there\u2019s no accountability to civil society or other countries. That\u2019s the sorry situation at this summit.\u201d",

Nielsen does not disclose the actual spending figures because it is commercially sensitive data.\nMany of the adverts are for the national lottery, but ads broadcast during the school run also include spots for betting and online slot machine brands such as Gala Casino.\nAfter it was contacted by the Guardian, Entain, which owns Gala Casino, is understood to have added a stipulation to its media-buying arrangements to prevent broadcast during weekday school-run times.\nGovernment statistics suggest millions of children are likely to be in the car during the period. There are 8.9 million schoolchildren in the country and the last in-depth survey by the Department for Transport survey found that 46% of children aged 5-10, and 23% of those aged 11-16, go to school by car.\nAddiction experts and campaigners said the figures underscore the need for an ongoing government review of gambling regulation to take a tough stance on advertising.\nHeather Wardle, Lord Kelvin Adam Smith reader in social sciences at Glasgow University, said: \u201cCommercial gambling is rightly considered an adult-only activity, yet the way it\u2019s advertised across radio and other media makes it very difficult to protect our children from being exposed to this.\n\u201cEvidence from the Gambling Commission shows that 7% of children exposed to gambling advertising said that seeing or hearing advertising prompts them to gamble when they were not planning on doing so.\u201d\nLabour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group examining gambling harms, called for reform of \u201cnational disgrace\u201d advertising rules. \u201cUntil we completely overhaul their access to advertising platforms, we will continue to expose children and vulnerable adults to this unrelenting attack,\u201d she said.\nThe government is due to publish proposals for the reform of gambling regulation early next year.\nA spokesperson for the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) said: \u201cBGC members abide by the strict rules set down by the Advertising Standards Authority. Indeed, since the BGC began two years ago, we have introduced a number of measures to go even further than the requirements of the advertising codes developed by both the ASA and the Committees of Advertising Practice.\n\u201cIn addition, our members also ensure that 20% of their TV and radio ads are safer gambling messages.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the national lottery operator, Camelot, said it needed to advertise at all times of the day to reach as many people as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve always followed strict guidelines to ensure our ads don\u2019t appeal to children, and this has contributed to it being widely recognised that the inherent risk of unhealthy play associated with national lottery games is extremely low,\u201d said the spokesperson.",

        "content": "Delegation aims to portray party as engaged even as Republicans back home have downplayed and dismissed climate change\nA handful of Republican members of Congress have arrived at the UN climate talks in Glasgow in an attempt to portray the party as engaged on the climate crisis, with this message already badly undermined by colleagues back in the US who have downplayed and even dismissed the impacts of global heating during the summit.\nA delegation of five Republican lawmakers arrived at the talks, known as Cop26, on the weekend and will depart on Tuesday. Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican, said that the politicians were \u201cnot going there just to drink\u201d and will hold a number of meetings to stress a different approach to climate change than Joe Biden.\n\u201cRepublicans care deeply about the environment and preserving it for future generations,\u201d insisted John Curtis, a Republican congressman from Utah and another member of the group. \u201cWe have ideas, and we want to be at the table to find solutions.\u201d\nBut the tone has been markedly different from the bulk of elected Republicans back in the US, who have either ignored the landmark talks, which scientists say must deliver rapid cuts in planet-heating emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change around the world, or sought to dismiss its importance.\nHighlighting the dismissal of climate science that permeates the GOP unlike any other major political party around the world, Steve Scalise, the Republican whip in the House of Representatives, said last week that \u201cit gets warmer, it gets colder \u2013 that\u2019s called Mother Nature\u201d.\nScalise added that \u201ccarbon emissions have been around from when before man walked the Earth \u2026 the idea that hurricanes or wildfires were caused in just the last few years is just fallacy.\u201d\nThe world\u2019s leading climate scientists have said that the evidence that humans are altering the climate is \u201cunequivocal\u201d and that \u201cirreversible\u201d impacts are being locked in by continued burning of fossil fuels that is causing the world to heat up.\nThe world\u2019s temperature is now higher than at any point in human civilization, with scientists warning that disastrous heatwaves, floods and wildfires are pushing many parts of the world towards the edge of human livability.\nOther Republicans attacked Biden\u2019s attendance at the talks. Senator John Barrasso, of Wyoming, questioned the emissions of flying a \u201cbloated US delegation\u201d to Scotland while Senator John Kennedy, of Louisiana, said that Biden, his climate envoy John Kerry and \u201cother Trotsky-like wokers\u201d want to \u201cbuy natural gas and oil from other countries, and basically give countries that hate us more money, so they\u2019ll have weapons to try to kill us\u201d.\nThe comments have prompted ridicule from climate experts.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that comment from Scalise, it was extraordinary, just unbelievable,\u201d said Robert Brulle, a professor of sociology and environmental science at Drexel University. \u201cIt\u2019s the most retro thing I\u2019ve seen in a long time. It\u2019s comical in a way \u2013 do they expect people to take them seriously when they say things like this?\u201d\nRepublican disdain for climate science was embodied by Donald Trump, who famously called it a \u201choax\u201d and \u201cbullshit\u201d, but the party has sought to reset its image somewhat since the former president\u2019s electoral defeat last year. Polling shows that younger Republicans, in particular, are concerned about climate breakdown and want the party to reflect this.\n\u201cThis sort of rhetoric is the old talking points and we clearly need new talking points spread more widely,\u201d said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who founded republicEn, a group that advocates for climate policy.\nInglis said he hoped the Republicans going to Glasgow will realize the benefits of a global price put on carbon dioxide emissions, a policy favored by some moderate members of the party, such as Utah senator Mitt Romney, who see it as an effective market-based response to the climate crisis.\n\u201cI hope they get a sense of how vital it is for America to lead, that they have a sense of acceptance and are welcomed into the conversation,\u201d Inglis said. \u201cI hope they get that vibe rather than told they are the dumb kids in class. That probably won\u2019t be helpful.\u201d\nDespite the calls for change from sections of the Republican party, it still has yet to put forward any sort of substantive plan that would deal with the climate crisis, nor set out how its focus on innovation and voluntary action will hit emissions reduction targets scientists say are urgently needed to avoid disastrous global heating.\nWith this lacking, critics say the party\u2019s gradual change in rhetoric is little more than a superficial rebrand to avoid alienating the growing number of American voters, battered by several years of worsening fires and floods, who say they are alarmed about the climate emergency.\nRepublicans also remain closely aligned to the fossil fuel industry. At a recent Congressional questioning of the oil and gas companies that knowingly caused dangerous global heating, several GOP members apologized to executives for the hearing and refrained from asking them about climate change.\n\u201cThat was really a demonstration to me of how the Republican party aren\u2019t engaging in a good faith debate on climate change \u2013 they have no solutions and just preach the ideology of fossil fuel companies,\u201d said Brulle. \u201cI just can\u2019t take them seriously on climate. It is somewhat depressing to see the lockstep the Republicans are marching to on this.\u201d",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today.\nA watchdog had to prevent ministers breaching a strict code on political neutrality and independence during the search for new leaders for the BBC and the British Film Institute. A Freedom of Information Act response by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments has revealed that ministers were asked to replace interview panellists for the high-profile jobs because they were \u201cnot sufficiently independent\u201d. The regulator has described such breaches as \u201cthreatening to undermine the independent status\u201d of a role intended to bring \u201cchallenge and rigour\u201d to finding appointable candidates for selection by cabinet ministers, including the prime minister.\nIt highlights concern that the government is seeking to \u201crebalance\u201d the boards of public bodies \u2013 particularly in the arts, heritage and broadcasting sectors \u2013 and comes as MPs hold an emergency debate on standards in the wake of the Owen Paterson scandal. The Commons standards committee is considering a ban on MPs from holding consultancy roles which could affect around 30 members. The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is also expected to make an intervention, with one report claiming he is set to propose his own review of the standards rules for MPs.\nBooster threat \u2013 More than 10 million people in the UK have had Covid vaccine top-up shots, figures show, as government sources confirmed they are considering travel restrictions on people who do not take up the booster offer. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will put the worst of the pandemic behind them this morning when they resume transatlantic flights for leisure travellers to the US for the first time since Covid-19 closed borders in March 2020. BA flight BA001 \u2013 a number previously reserved for Concorde \u2013 and Virgin flight VS3 will take off from Heathrow on parallel runways for New York\u2019s JFK airport at 8.30am.\nAstroworld investigation \u2013 Police in Houston are investigating how eight people died in a crush of fans at a concert by rapper Travis Scott on Friday, as families mourned the dead and concertgoers recounted the horror and confusion of being trapped in the crowd. One fan claimed on Instagram that people began to \u201cdrown\u201d in the crush as soon as 30 seconds into Scott\u2019s set. The singer, who has spoken of his devastation at the tragedy, has already been named in a lawsuit from an injured attendee, which also targets the concert organiser and promoter. The suit alleges \u201cmotivation for profit at the expense of concertgoers\u2019 health and safety\u201d.\nUnfair Cop \u2013 The legitimacy of the Cop26 climate summit has been questioned by participants who say restrictions on access to negotiations are unprecedented and unjust. As the gathering enters its second week, observers warn that excluding them from negotiating areas and speaking to negotiators could have dire consequences for millions of people. Their ability to observe, interact and intervene in negotiations on carbon markets, loss and damage and climate financing has been obstructed during the first week, the Guardian has been told. A survey in 10 countries has revealed that although people are alarmed by the climate crisis, few are willing to make significant lifestyle changes.\nBrexit violence \u2013 A bus was set on fire last night by four masked men on the outskirts of Belfast, sparking fresh fears of of violence by loyalists opposed to the Brexit withdrawal deal. The men boarded the double-decker bus in Newtownabbey at about 7.45pm, ordered passengers to get off, and set it alight. It came as the prospect of a trade war between the UK and the EU has edged closer, with Ireland giving the clearest hint yet that Brussels plans to suspend the entire trade deal struck last December if the British government suspends the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol.\nRoyal decree \u2013 The wartime forces\u2019 sweetheart, Vera Lynn, was ordered to perform at Princess Elizabeth\u2019s 16th birthday celebrations at Windsor Castle in 1942, even though the entertainer was meant to appear in a London show on the same day. A previously unseen document reveals she was told her services were \u201crequired for a private command performance\u201d laid on by King George VI. The letter forms part of a new exhibition of memorabilia belonging to the singer, who died last year aged 103.\nThe world\u2019s only gay top-flight footballer, Adelaide United\u2019s Josh Cavallo, talks about the \u201coverwhelming\u201d response to his recent coming out.

He tells Chris Godfrey about how growing up in rural France shaped his view of the world (\u201cIt gives you patience\u201d), his mastery of dressing room psychology (\u201cI learned to control myself\u201d) and how he would have his career all over again despite the cost to family life.\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp was left incensed with the referee Craig Pawson and his video assistant Stuart Attwell after Liverpool\u2019s 3-2 defeat by West Ham on Sunday, claiming the officials had let down his players in regard to two key decisions and accusing Attwell of \u201chiding\u201d behind Pawson on both calls. Exultant in victory, Max Verstappen revelled in his success at the Mexican Grand Prix. He was clearly aware of the significance of the achievement. From third on the grid he beat Lewis Hamilton into second place and the win crashed with thunderous import across the championship, his joy surely informed by the knowledge that he has opened a 19-point lead that leaves Hamilton facing a huge challenge to overcome in the title fight, with only four more races to come.\nMarcus Smith simply must play at No 10 for England in the rugby Test against Australia this week, full stop. Not to select him would, frankly, be akin to an act of cultural vandalism. Beaten 41-32 in the 2017 World Cup final by New Zealand, England\u2019s Red Roses have now put 99 points on the current champions across two one-sided contests. The latest result, a battering at Franklin\u2019s Gardens, underlined a seismic shift in the global power balance.

If this limit is exceeded, then by the time younger members are old enough to draw our pensions, a full-blown climate catastrophe will have struck, with ice caps melted, food systems collapsed and deadly extreme weather becoming the norm.\u201d\nA total of 132 MPs have signed, including 107 of the 199 members of the parliamentary Labour party, with nine members of the shadow cabinet signing. Thirteen SNP MPs, five Liberal Democrats and two Conservatives also signed, among others.\nThe letter, drafted to coincide with the UK\u2019s hosting of the Cop26 climate summit, reiterates a UN warning that current investment in planned fossil fuel extraction \u201cvastly exceeds\u201d the limit needed to keep global heating below the 1.5C rise mandated by the Paris agreement.\n\u201cIt is recognised that as elected representatives, we have a responsibility to show leadership on the climate emergency and ensure that our pensions are not funding climate disaster,\u201d it says. \u201cLet us get our house in order by aligning our pension investments with a green and prosperous zero-carbon future that helps to contain global heating to below 1.5\u00b0C.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s eyes are on us. It is time that we show true leadership and divest parliament from the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\nThe letter has been coordinated by the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana as part of the long-running Divest Parliament campaign, which claims the backing of more than 360 current and former MPs.\nAnother signatory, David Warburton, the Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, said Cop26 had put the UK \u201cat the centre of international diplomacy and coalition-building in a pivotal moment for climate action\u201d.\nThe branch of the GMB union that represents MPs\u2019 staff this week said it supported Divest Parliament and announced that it would be launching a similar campaign centred on staff pensions. \u201cWe recognise that MPs and the Westminster community have a unique opportunity to show leadership on climate action and responsible investment through addressing the practices of their own pension fund,\u201d it said in a tweet.",

We knew my brother and sister-in-law were being threatened for defending the environment \u2013 but we never imagined they\u2019d actually be killed. The state knew about all the violence their community was suffering from land-grabbers and loggers, and nothing was done.\nTen years later it still hurts so much. Each morning I remember. Every day my mother cries. But we knew we wouldn\u2019t find peace until there was real justice. So eventually we decided that rather than just mourning, we had to fight.\nWe were part of the struggle for social and environmental justice long before Z\u00e9 Claudio and Maria were killed. But when you\u2019re driven by pain and fear, and above all injustice, it makes you bolder. So I embraced my fear, my despair and my pain. Some days I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed for fear of being shot because of the death threats I was getting. Or because I was consumed by the pain of losing Z\u00e9 and Maria. I overcame all this because we believe change is possible.\nWhat\u2019s crucial is our capacity for resilience. And our ability to stand up and say: \u201cI\u2019ll fight. I\u2019ll denounce things. I\u2019ll ask the international community to pay attention. I will not remain silent.\u201d\nZ\u00e9 and Maria fought until the very end because they wanted a better world for others. They wanted to live in peace in the place that was theirs \u2013 just as so many others continue to fight for their lands, forests and waters around the world. Yet today, the situation remains the same, and in some ways is even worse \u2013 because there\u2019s even less forest and more environmental defenders are being killed. Everything Z\u00e9 and Maria fought against while they were alive continues: the killings, the destruction of the forest.\nThis is a struggle that will never end because just when you think things couldn\u2019t get any worse, along comes [Brazil\u2019s president, Jair] Bolsonaro. Never in my worst nightmares could I have imagined we\u2019d face such regression.\nWe\u2019ve reached the limit of everything. Nature\u2019s limit. The limit of our own strength.

        "content": "While players such as Emma Raducanu instantly succeed, the Estonian and her rival Ons Jabeur have taken a steadier path\nThree months ago, during the height of a fierce Ohioan summer, the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati opened with a brutal contest in the women\u2019s draw. Ons Jabeur and Anett Kontaveit, two unseeded, high-class players drew each other in the first round and then for more than two hours they battled into the night. The match was eventually decided by minuscule details, Jabeur winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.\nAt the time nobody could have imagined how the rest of the season would unfold for them. While the Tunisian was in the midst of a breakthrough summer and sat in the final spot in the race to the WTA Finals in Guadalajara, the year-end tournament held between the top eight players, Kontaveit\u2019s season had become stagnant. Her defeat against Jabeur was her fifth consecutive loss. She was 27th in the race, almost 1,000 points behind Jabeur. Her unsatisfactory form had led her to a new coaching appointment that week, the former player Dmitry Tursunov.\nA week later she went to Cleveland and defeated five lower-ranked players to win her second WTA title. Instead of a displeasing end to the season, that victory began one of the most abrupt, unforeseen late-season turnarounds in recent memory. As summer faded, Kontaveit played with increasing authority, commanding the important points as results quickly fell her way.\nShe won her second title of 2021 in Ostrava, demolishing three top-15 players in a row. Then she went to Moscow and won there, too, destroying Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, the world No 5, 6-1, 6-1 en route. In Romania she outclassed Simona Halep 6-3, 6-2 in the final of the former No 1\u2019s home tournament, leapfrogging Jabeur to qualify for the WTA Finals, which begin on Wednesday, in the process.\nKontaveit has risen from 28th in the WTA rankings at the end of July to eighth, has won four titles in her past six completed tournaments and compiled a monstrous win-loss record of 26-2 since that defeat against Jabeur in August. She is the in-form player.\nAlthough the abruptness of her success is surprising, Kontaveit\u2019s ability has been clear over the past four years she has spent as a top\u201130 player. She is a premier shotmaker who takes the ball daringly early and is armed with one of the sweetest, most destructive backhands in the game. She hails from Estonia, one of the smallest countries in Europe with a population of 1.3 million. Her biggest obstacle was simple: when she faced the big players in the biggest tournaments they could count on her faltering or playing scared in the most important moments.\nShe offers no magical reason for her transformation, except that she is enjoying her tennis more, working consistently and taking each challenge as it comes. Her run underlines that success comes at different times for everyone and that, with discipline, patience and sufficient work, just one positive result and the confidence that comes with it can shift a player\u2019s entire trajectory.\nA few months before Kontaveit made her name as a junior in 2011, winning the prestigious Orange Bowl just before her 16th birthday, Jabeur became the first Arab girl to win a junior grand slam tournament, at the French Open. While some, like Emma Raducanu, can instantly break through, their decade-long trajectories show how many lessons, losses, slumps and small nuggets of progress it can take to reach the top stages.\nFew players can step on to any court around the world as an unknown and leave with the crowd chanting their name but such is the force of her varied, pure style of play, this is a constant feature of Jabeur\u2019s career. She peppers opponents with drop shots, net forays, nuclear forehands and just about every other shot in the book. Like Kontaveit she has had to learn how to produce in the pressure moments but, additionally, having so many options can often be a menace. Jabeur has slowly learned how to harness her elaborate style and with every year she has grown.\nThe fruits of Jabeur\u2019s labour have been clear throughout another season of blazing her trail around the world. During the grasscourt season, she became the first Arab woman to win a WTA tour title. She followed her top-20 debut in August, shortly after reaching the Wimbledon quarter-final, by becoming the first Arab and north African tennis player, man or woman, to reach the top 10. Her success is all the more fulfilling because it has been achieved in her own way. She is accompanied by a Tunisian coach, Issam Jellali. She has thrived by refining her own unique, creative style instead of neutering it, as other coaches have suggested in the past, to suit the modern game. Tunis is still her official residence.\nIn the end Jabeur\u2019s form did not fade at all. She reached a final in Chicago and the semi-finals of Indian Wells but as Kontaveit surged Jabeur picked up an injury and was unable to compete in her final two events. After Kontaveit passed her for the final spot in Mexico, she was the first to congratulate the Estonian, whom she has known since their junior years. Despite coming from a region that is barely represented at the top of tennis, she is one of the most sporting, social and popular players in the locker room.\nFor both players the lesson from their success is that patience is everything. While Kontaveit has been rewarded with her first WTA Finals appearance, Jabeur should take solace in the steadiness of her own rise and the certainty that, if she continues on the same path, there is so much more to accomplish.",

        "content": "Will Smith stars as the father of the precocious tennis talents in a movie depicting their improbable journey\nThe story of Venus and Serena Williams\u2019 rise to greatness, two legendary tennis careers propelled by the foresight of their father, has often been likened to a Hollywood movie. Now, with the release of King Richard on 19 November, it will be.\nWill Smith stars as Richard Williams, the sisters\u2019 father, in a film depicting how he guided his two daughters from the public courts of Compton, California, to becoming two of the most accomplished tennis players in the history of the sport.\nSmith cites a famous interview involving a teenage Venus Williams, during which Richard Williams interrupts and criticises a journalist for questioning his daughter\u2019s confidence, as inspiration for his decision to take the role: \u201cI saw that in real time and the look on Venus\u2019 face \u2013 the image burned in my heart because that\u2019s how I wanted my daughter to look when I showed up,\u201d Smith said in a press conference on Sunday. \u201cThat interview really changed my parenting at that time.\n\u201cI fell in love with Richard Williams 20-something years ago. When the opportunity to be a part of this came up, that was the first thing that I remembered. I knew I wanted to show a father protecting a daughter like that to the world.\u201d\nVenus and Serena Williams, who are played by Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton respectively, have gone on to become two of the greatest tennis players of all time, with Serena Williams winning 23 major singles titles, the open era record among both male and female players, while Venus Williams won seven grand slam titles in singles. They are both executive producers of King Richard alongside their older sister Isha Price, who played a more active role in the film\u2019s production and was a regular presence on the set during filming.\nPrice says that she initially brought the script to her sisters and the rest of their family, and that it took some time for them to build sufficient trust in the project. She says they wanted to make sure that the \u201cstory was told right, it was fair and it was honest, and it really displayed the integrity that we\u2019ve always tried to have as a family\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cIt took some time to get there with my family because there\u2019s a little bit of distrust, as you can imagine, being in the public eye for as long as they have.\u201d\nThe film premiered at the Telluride film festival in September and has received positive reviews for its storytelling and Smith\u2019s performance. Despite the success Serena Williams has achieved across a 24-year career, she says that the experience of seeing her story come to life in a Hollywood movie was eye-opening.\n\u201cHonestly, no word describes it better than just \u2018surreal\u2019, just to see these incredible actresses and everyone behind it just putting this all together about our dad\u2019s journey,\u201d said Serena Williams. \u201cBecause of myself and my sister, it really is just like, \u2018Wow, really, OK? Are we really something?\u201d kind of thing. It really is super surreal for me.\u201d\nWhile their careers are being told on the big screen, they have not yet finished. During a recent interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live for the movie\u2019s promotional run, Serena Williams said that she was \u201cdefinitely\u201d planning to play in the Australian Open. The 40-year-old has not competed since tearing her hamstring after slipping in her first-round match at Wimbledon in June. Venus Williams, also nursing an injury that forced her to withdraw from the US Open, has also previously stated her intention to compete in 2022. Venus Williams, 41, made her professional debut 27 years ago.",

        "content": "On Sunday Jordan Love made the first start of his career against the Kansas City Chiefs. It appears the the decision to draft him was not worth the drama\nKansas City\u2019s 13-7 win over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday was filled with hollow victories.\nThe Chiefs\u2019 offense continues to cough and wheeze. The Chiefs\u2019 defense, so dismal all year, was finally able to put together a complete performance, albeit against a quarterback who looked in over his head in his first NFL start. The Packers, with a talented defense and a warlock-level coach capable of scotch-taping over even the worst holes, were competitive, even in defeat.\nBut it was the man who wasn\u2019t in the building who was the biggest winner.\nThe Packers were given a glimpse of the post-Aaron Rodgers world on Sunday. The idea: intriguing. The reality: painful.\nThis week will resonate long after Rodgers exits the game. He has revealed himself to be the kind of pseudo-intellectual who takes his medical advice from a podcast host who has spent the bulk of his life getting kicked in the head. Rodgers has altered his perception among the general public: from free-thinker to imbecile; or petulant brat to freedom fighter, depending on the reader\u2019s perspective.\nYet on Sunday, as the Chiefs sent blitz after blitz towards his overwhelmed understudy, it was Rodgers\u2019 skill as a quarterback that was back in focus; and there everyone can agree on his brilliance.\nThe Packers drafted Love in the first round of the 2020 draft. The team also knew that by selecting a quarterback, and not notifying their future Hall of Famer, that it was more likely than not that Rodgers was on his way out and Love would be starting by 2022 at the latest.\nAs Sunday showed, Love is nowhere near ready. The Chiefs brought all kinds of pressure, sending five- and six-man blitzes from every conceivable angle. No team would take such a gamble against Rodgers, one of the finest blitz-beaters in the game. Against Love, the Chiefs sent blitzes on 19 of his 34 dropbacks.\nLove\u2019s inability to punish the Chiefs\u2019 blitz-heavy defense almost forced Troy Aikman, Hall of Fame quarterback and Fox\u2019s Football Analyst in Chief, into a midgame breakdown. \u201cIf there\u2019s no one in the middle of the field, throw it in the middle of the field,\u201d an exasperated Aikman said late in the fourth quarter.\nAll young quarterbacks take time to get up to speed, but it\u2019s Love\u2019s second year in the league. Isn\u2019t the whole point of sitting and learning that it gives a player a better chance to perform once they come into the game?\nLove\u2019s debut is in keeping with the recent history of quarterbacks who sit during their rookie season. The list of quarterbacks who were selected early and then sat for a full season since Rodgers infamously did (for three seasons) includes:\n- Patrick Mahomes\n- Jimmy Garoppolo\n- Brodie Croyle\n- Brock Osweiler\n- Garrett Grayson\n- Chad Henne\n- Jake Locker\n- Kevin Kolb\n- Kellen Clemens\nMahomes aside, history tells us that a quarterback sits for the entirety of his first year for one of two reasons: 1) He\u2019s backing up Tom Brady or 2) He stinks.\nMahomes is the anomaly, not evidence that giving young, erratic quarterbacks more practice time will solve either their defects. During the summer stand-off with Rodgers, the Packers convinced themselves that Love was sitting because he was behind a master. Love would be good. Good enough to make it worth rupturing a relationship with Rodgers in his late prime, even. Love, the Packers believed, would be worth the wait and whatever awkwardness would arise with Rodgers.\nPerhaps not. Love looked chaotic in the pocket on Sunday, his feet and eyes moving at two different speeds. He completed just 19 of 34 attempts \u2013 55% \u2013 tossing one touchdown and a rough-looking redzone interception. The Packers went scoreless in the first half, the first time the team has failed to score in a half in almost two years.\nThat gulp you hear is the sound of every Packers executive rethinking their decisions.\nIn 2019, the Packers made a dramatic shift on offense, moving from the Rodgers system of old to the Matt LaFleur system, which promoted the running backs and put the team\u2019s receivers in better spots. It was a system that no longer needed Aaron Rodgers to be Aaron Rodgers. For some reason, this gave the Packers the notion that they may not need Rodgers at all.\nOops. Drafting Love rather than an impact receiver or defensive player who could have helped Rodgers win a Super Bowl while he was still near his peak looked bonkers at the time. The further we gain distance from it, the more damaging and indefensible it becomes.\nLove may prove to be an upper-tier NFL starter one day. He has all the physical tools to be the kind of off-script creator that a quarterback needs to be in the modern game. Maybe he\u2019ll put it all together at some point; maybe he won\u2019t. What\u2019s clear is that he isn\u2019t close to being a difference-maker at this point in his career.\nLife with Rodgers may be frustrating and, at times, exhausting. But the Packers were offered a glimpse of the post-Rodgers landscape on Sunday. It wasn\u2019t encouraging.\nNick Chubb, running back, Cleveland Browns. All eyes were on Baker Mayfield and the Browns offense after the team waived Odell Beckham last week. The response: dominance. Chubb lit up the Cincy front to the tune of 137 yards and two touchdowns, averaging over nine yards a carry; Mayfield hit Donovan Peoples-Jones for a 60-yard touchdown off play-action. The final score was 41-16. It could have easily been more.\nThis is what Stefanski wants the Browns offense to look like. Pound the defense with the run game, then take play-action shots downfield \u2013 all of it flowing through Chubb and the team\u2019s offensive line.\nWhatever went wrong with Beckham in Cleveland, it\u2019s clear that a divorce was in the best interests of both parties. The reasons remain murky, but there is good evidence that the Cleveland machine sings when Beckham is out of the lineup. Beckham will likely have his pick of the contenders once he clears waivers, allowing him to join a team that can better use his skill-set.\nJacksonville\u2019s Josh Allen became the first recorded player in NFL history to sack a quarterback with the same name \u2026 dropping Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen.\nIf the Sackigami wasn\u2019t enough, Allen also became the first player to intercept a quarterback of the same name, as well as adding a fumble recovery to the proceedings. The Jaguars pulled off one of the upsets of the season, beating a sputtering Bills team 9-6. Josh Allen \u2013 of the quarterback variety \u2013 had a poor day, while his namesake was the decisive reason in the Jags picking up the win. The only plausible conclusion: The ManningCast curse is real.\nWe have a new nominee for the Worst Rule In The League.\nIn #DENvsDAL, the punt is blocked & goes beyond the line of scrimmage, where it's touched by the receiving team. Since the receiving team touches the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, the kicking team is eligible to recover the ball. DEN recovers the ball, but cannot advance it. pic.twitter.com/bcdUEGu3Jd\nThe Broncos beat the Cowboys in Dallas, but they did so with help from one of the league\u2019s iffier rules. With 12 minutes left in the third quarter, trailing 16-0, the Cowboys blocked a punt at the Broncos\u2019 17-yard line. A game-changer, right?\nNot so fast. The Cowboys touched the ball again after it went past the line of scrimmage before the Broncos recovered the block. That resulted in a first down for the Broncos rather than a turnover on downs. How or why a team receives a new set of downs for not advancing the ball beyond the first-down marker is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cWe gave the game ball to faith ... That\u2019s the star of the game\u201d -- John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens head coach.\nHarbaugh would probably be better off giving the ball to Lamar Jackson \u2013 again. Sunday served as another reminder that no lead is safe while Jackson is still in the game. Twice trailing by 14 points, the Ravens offense continued to churn out yards and scores. Jackson led the Ravens\u2019 offense to 23 unanswered points, pushing the game into overtime before Baltimore were able to kick a field goal to win. After a sloppy start, Jackson accounted for three touchdowns and 386 yards of the Ravens\u2019 total offense \u2013 a gaudy 77% of the team\u2019s production. No team is ever all about one player but given the Ravens\u2019 issues on defense, this is a team being carried by its offense. And that offense runs almost exclusively through its unique quarterback.\n-- Don\u2019t look now, but the Patriots are starting to figure things out. Rookie quarterback Mac Jones has not played well over the past two weeks, but it hasn\u2019t mattered because other areas of the team have picked up the slack. The offensive line is healthy. The run game is overwhelming. The defense is certifiably feisty. Some teams work all season to discover that much-vaunted \u2018identity\u2019. The Patriots have theirs: they run the ball and play good defense. Over the past five weeks, they\u2019ve averaged 33 rush attempts per game for an average of 138 yards. The Bills remain the most talented team in the AFC East, but they\u2019re now tied with the Patriots with five wins on the season.\n-- Matt Stafford\u2019s MVP candidacy hit a bump as he threw two interceptions in the Rams\u2019 Sunday night loss to the Titans, who were without their star running back Derrick Henry. It was another impressive win for Tennessee, who have made a speciality of beating good teams. They\u2019ve now seen off the Bills and Rams this season and have the easiest remaining schedule in the league.\n-- The 2021 Panthers illustrate how an otherwise good rebuild can be derailed if you make the biggest mistake of them all: picking the wrong quarterback. There\u2019s talent all over the Panthers roster as well as creative, innovative coaching minds. They should be better, and yet they\u2019re hamstrung by the Darnold Experiment. All of the sharp roster building has been undercut by the quarterback\u2019s play, and his salary will continue to be a drag on the team\u2019s salary cap next year.\n-- If you want to know how hopeless things feel in Houston right now: the Texans were down 17-6 to the Dolphins, and kicked a field goal from the two-yard line. To make matters worse: the teams combined for nine turnovers. Miami had five, Houston four. Somehow, the Dolphins won anyway. It was Miami\u2019s first win while committing at least five turnovers since 1990.\n-- There aren\u2019t many stories better this season than that of Cordarrelle Patterson. The former do-everything kick returner turned running back turned gimmick has blossomed into a legitimate No 1 receiver in Atlanta. After the Saints scored 23 unanswered points to put the Saints ahead of the Falcons with under two minutes to play, Matt Ryan found Patterson for a 64-yard pick-up to put Atlanta in field goal range. Younghoe Koo hit the game-winning kick to give the Falcons the 27-25 win over their division rivals.",

        "content": "Special rapporteur Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng argues in brief filed in a US court that overturning abortion rights would violate international human rights treaties ratified by the US\nThe United Nations special rapporteur on the right to health has called on the US supreme court to uphold the right to abortion in America or risk undermining international human rights law and threatening that right elsewhere in the world.\nThe special rapporteur, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, is one of just a handful of global observers whose mandate is to travel the world defending human rights.\nMofokeng has argued in a brief filed in a US court that overturning abortion rights would violate international human rights treaties ratified by the US, including the convention against torture, should women be forced to carry pregnancies to term.\nIn an interview, Mofokeng told the Guardian she could have filed a brief on abortion rights, \u201cin any other court, in any other abortion case,\u201d globally. However, she chose the US courts because of the direct threat posed to abortion rights in the supreme court\u2019s upcoming session.\n\u201cWe have this joke among us that when the US sneezes the rest of the world catches a [cold],\u201d said Mofokeng. \u201cSo we know that politically that what happens in the United States\u2026 does have an impact in precedents elsewhere in the world.\u201d\nMofokeng\u2019s brief was filed ahead of oral arguments in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a case advocates fear will undermine abortion rights nationally. Dobbs poses a direct threat to Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 case that established a Constitutional right to abortion based in privacy.\nRoe invalidated dozens of state abortion bans and restrictions, and allowed people to terminate a pregnancy up to the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, generally understood to be about 24 weeks gestation. A full term pregnancy is 39 weeks.\n\u201cIf that gets overturned, it has catastrophic implications, not just for the US,\u201d said Mofokeng, who said she feared overturning Roe would embolden global attacks on reproductive rights.\nMofokeng is also a practicing doctor and well-known sex-positive author in South Africa. Most often, she goes by \u201cDr T\u201d, an informal title which underscores the empathy in her academic analysis. Her most recent UN report outlined the challenges Covid-19 posed to reproductive rights, and how colonialism continues to affect global policies on reproduction, from sterilization to abortion bans.\n\u201cIt means that even those people who are conservative, who are anti-rights, in any country in the world, will actually now start referencing the US court as an example of jurisprudence that should be followed,\u201d said Mofokeng. \u201cAnd this is why this is so dangerous\u201d.\nIn Dobbs, the court will consider whether Mississippi can ban abortion at 15 weeks gestation. For the court to uphold Mississippi\u2019s law, it would require the court to rewrite standards that determine whether abortion restrictions are constitutional. Advocates fear that could once again allow states to severely restrict or ban abortion.\nA majority of the court\u2019s nine justices would need to agree to rewrite such standards. Conservative justices hold a 6-3 supermajority on the court. Many observers view the court\u2019s decision to take the Mississippi case as an ominous sign. About six in 10 Americans believe abortion should be legal in \u201call or most cases\u201d.\n\u201cIf Roe \u2026 [were] overturned, many US states will implement bans or near-bans on abortion access that will make individual state laws irreconcilable with international human rights law,\u201d the brief argued. \u201cThis would cause irreparable harm to women and girls in violation of the United States\u2019 obligations under the human rights treaties it has signed and ratified.\u201d\nWhile the US has not ratified several United Nations treaties, it has ratified the convention against torture, which Mofokeng\u2019s brief argued would be violated if states were allowed to ban abortion.\n\u201cThe denial of safe abortions and subjecting women and girls to humiliating and judgmental attitudes in such contexts of extreme vulnerability and where timely health care is essential amount to torture or ill treatment,\u201d Mofokeng\u2019s brief said, citing a 2016 report by the rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\nConversely, Mofokeng\u2019s brief argued, contrary to Mississippi\u2019s assertions, that \u201cthe right to life emanating from human rights treaties does not apply prenatally,\u201d and that the \u201coverwhelming trend for the past half-century has been toward the liberalization of abortion laws worldwide\u201d.\nFurther, since the court has accepted the Dobbs case, it also allowed a six-week abortion ban to go into effect in Texas in September, effectively allowing the nation\u2019s second largest state to nullify Roe within its borders. Experts estimate that if Roe were overturned, roughly two dozen US states mostly in the south and midwest would immediately ban abortion.\nSuch bans would have immediate and direct consequences for women and people seeking abortions.\nIn one recent analysis, the Guttmacher Institute found 26 states are certain or likely to outlaw abortion should Roe be overturned. In just one example, that would require a woman seeking a legal abortion in Louisiana to travel to Kansas to access care.\n\u201cThe rise in global anti-gender and anti-women\u2019s rights is such that people will grasp at anything that seems to make their case solid,\u201d said Mofokeng. And, she said, the case before the supreme court now relies on \u201cnon-medical, non-scientific\u201d misinformation.\n\u201cIt means we have a risk of now having global jurisprudence \u2013 or at least influences in the global world \u2013 using jurisprudence that\u2019s ill-informed. And that\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d said Mofokeng. \u201cTo undo the court\u2019s decisions takes decades, sometimes a lifetime \u2013 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d",

        "content": "Chinese citizen journalist recognised for her reporting in early weeks of pandemic in face of threats\nThe detained Chinese journalist Zhang Zhan has been nominated for a Reporters Without Borders (RSF) press freedom award for courage, recognising her work reporting from Wuhan in the early weeks of the pandemic, as calls grow for her release.\nThe former lawyer turned citizen journalist was convicted in December of \u201cpicking quarrels and causing trouble\u201d, a ubiquitous catch-all accusation frequently used against journalists, lawyers and dissidents in China.\nZhang was sentenced to four years in jail. She had already been in detention since her initial arrest in May 2020, and has been on hunger strike. Last week, her family said the 38-year-old was \u201cclose to death\u201d, amplifying global calls for her immediate release.\nIn its nomination on Monday, RSF said Zhang had withstood \u201cconstant threats from the authorities\u201d in order to livestream her video reports from Wuhan\u2019s streets and hospitals and show the harassment to which families of Covid-19 patients were subjected.\n\u201cWidely shared on social media, her reporting was one of the main sources of independent information about the health situation in Wuhan at the time,\u201d it said.\nZhang, who was among a number of journalists arrested in Wuhan but was the first convicted, was accused of having sent \u201cfalse information through text, video and other media through the internet media such as WeChat, Twitter and YouTube\u201d, and having \u201cmaliciously speculated\u201d during interviews with foreign press, according to the indictment sheet.\nRSF\u2019s nomination noted claims made by Zhang\u2019s lawyer in the days after her conviction that she had been shackled in her cell and force-fed.\n\u201cThere is currently a great deal of concern that she could be subjected to further torture and ill-treatment,\u201d said RSF.\nZhang is being held in Shanghai. Last week, her brother said on Twitter that she was severely underweight and \u201cmay not live for much longer\u201d. He said Zhang, who is about 5ft 10in (177cm) tall, weighed only 6 stone 4lbs (40kg).\nThe RSF east Asia Bureau head, C\u00e9dric Alviani, said Zhang was a symbol of journalism in China under growing government oppression and regulatory restriction.\n\u201cZhang Zhan represents the hope of the Chinese people that some will keep doing journalism,\u201d Alviani said. \u201cThat they go where something happens and keep reporting. The Chinese people, like every person on Earth, crave information on what\u2019s happening around them.\u201d\nRSF was among a number of NGOs calling for Zhang\u2019s immediate release. Alviani said the conviction should be dropped but that at the very least, given the immediate health concerns, she should be released on humanitarian grounds.\n\u201cThe Chinese regime should never have judged her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe should be celebrated as a hero \u2013 she risked her life going to Wuhan at a moment when no one really knew what was going on.\u201d\nZhang was nominated for the prize for courage, one of three press freedom prizes, alongside Kay Zon Nway, a Myanmar journalist who was jailed for 124 days after she was arrested in February while livestreaming an anti-coup protest; Patricia Devlin, who has faced personal threats while reporting on organised crime and paramilitary activities in Northern Ireland; and the Nicaraguan weekly newspaper Confidencial, which has been repeatedly raided and its journalists targeted by authorities under Daniel Ortega\u2019s government.\n\u201cThese men, women and media outlets fight with courage and determination against converging forces that undermine journalistic independence,\u201d said the RSF secretary general, Christophe Deloire. \u201cThe RSF awards is a tribute and above all a support for all those who embody journalism\u2019s ideals.\u201d",

        "content": "Rights groups condemned decision to execute Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, who has learning disabilities\nSingapore\u2019s high court has stayed the execution of a man convicted of smuggling heroin, following outrage among rights groups who said he had learning disabilities and the sentence was a violation of international law.\nNagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a Malaysian national, was arrested in April 2009, when he was 21, for attempting to smuggle 43 grams of heroin into Singapore. The drugs had been strapped to his thigh. He was sentenced to death the following year and, having spent more than 12 years on death row, was told he would face execution on 10 November.\nThe sentencing has been widely condemned by international groups including Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network and Amnesty International. An online petition in support of Dharmalingam has attracted more than 62,000 signatures.\nAccording to campaigners, it was disclosed during the trial that Dharmalingam has an IQ of 69, a level recognised as indicating a learning disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. His supporters say there is evidence that Dharmalingam was forced to courier drugs as a victim of human trafficking.\nThe Malaysian prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, has written to Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, to ask for leniency in his case, according to Malaysian media, while the EU\u2019s delegation to Singapore has issued a statement calling for the execution to be stopped.\nMore than 200 family members and friends of prisoners who have lived on death row in Singapore have also called for Dharmalingam to be spared, and for the death penalty to be abolished.\n\u201cThere are no words to describe the pain of having a loved one on death row. Perhaps that is why we don\u2019t often speak of it, and our suffering goes unnoticed,\u201d they wrote in an open letter published by the Transformative Justice Collective.\n\u201cNagen\u2019s family has been unable to visit him for two years, during the pandemic border closure, and with two weeks\u2019 notice that their worst nightmare has arrived, they have to scramble to see him through a glass wall for just a few days before the date of execution.\u201d\n\u201cMany people on death row in Singapore \u2013 like Nagen and our loved ones \u2013 come from very challenging circumstances, and have led difficult, troubled lives which have entangled them with the drug trade. Often, as a result of their marginalisation, they find themselves in desperate and compromising situations.\u201d\nA group of eight British MPs and peers has written to the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, requesting she make urgent representations to her counterpart in Singapore \u201curging them to ensure that an intellectually disabled victim of trafficking is not executed after what may amount to a grave miscarriage of justice\u201d.\nSingapore has some of the world\u2019s harshest drugs laws, and the death penalty is mandatory for anyone found guilty of importing more than 15 grams of diamorphine. However, amendments passed in 2014 granted the court discretion to impose a life sentence rather than the death penalty if the defendant was only acting as a courier and \u201cwas suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offence\u201d.\nRights groups say that executing someone with an intellectual or psychosocial disability is a violation of international laws and standards.\nThe European Union\u2019s delegation to Singapore issued a statement calling for Dharmalingam\u2019s sentence to be commuted to a non-capital sentence. \u201cNo compelling evidence exists to show that the death penalty serves as a more efficient deterrent to crime than imprisonment,\u201d it said.\nDuring a hearing on Monday, Dharmalingam\u2019s lawyer argued that executing Dharmalingam, a man with learning disabilities, would violate Singapore\u2019s constitution. The high court ordered a stay of execution pending the hearing of an appeal to the court of appeal, his lawyer, M Ravi said. It is not clear when the appeal hearing will take place.\nEmina \u0106erimovi\u0107, a senior disability rights researcher at Human Rights Watch said in a statement last week that the sentences were \u201cdisproportionate and cruel, and deserve global condemnation\u201d.\nRachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International\u2019s Singapore researcher, added: \u201cTaking people\u2019s lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.\u201d\nIn a statement last week, Singapore\u2019s ministry of home affairs said Dharmalingam \u201cwas accorded full due process under the law, and was represented by legal counsel throughout the process. His petition to the president for clemency was unsuccessful.\u201d\nDharmalingam was caught trafficking 42.72 grams of diamorphine, it said, \u201cequivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin. It would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week,\u201d it said.",

Local news reports said the workers\u2019 union transported some of the injured to hospital, but it was not known how many people were injured.\nWitnesses said many people fled as the men set fire to tents before rounding up those who could not leave, putting hoods on their heads and forcing them into a lorry where they were beaten. Some people were thrown off at the side of the road a long way from the settlement and elderly people were left tied up on anthills. Some villagers hid in the forest, while the fate of others was unclear.\nOne witness, who did not want to be named, said her brother had been tied up and taken away and a woman who had been left on the road had told her that \u201c[the men] were hitting everyone a lot and my brother has a crack in his head and his mouth split open. We don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d\nAnother said: \u201cI heard shooting and everyone started running in all directions. I saw that they were setting the camp on fire, I saw six motorcycles on fire \u2026 there were many children, elderly people just thrown in the forest.\u201d\nDos Santos said: \u201cThis case has been going on for decades. The dispute was about to be resolved and the land given back [to the community]. This is not the first attack but people were assured there would be no more violence.\n\u201cFor more than 10 years, these workers have been there, resisting for their land rights and \u2026 ranchers simply arrive here and want to kill everyone,\u201d said Dos Santos, who fought against illegal logging with her brother, Jos\u00e9 Claudio Ribeiro dos Santos, and sister-in-law, Maria do Esp\u00edrito Santo, before they were killed in the area in 2011.\nDos Santos said the attack followed a campaign of harassment by local ranchers against the S\u00e3o Vinicius community, who are subsistence farmers. \u201cPolice and local authorities know about the threats but have done nothing to protect the community,\u201d she said.\n She said the attack came a day after police from the Marab\u00e1 municipality told the community there would be no conflict before a legal process concluded the Tinelli claim to a disputed area of about 1,690 hectares (17 sq km) on the 4,900-hectare farm (49 sq km) was illegal. That area is awaiting formal designation as a settlement for the community.\nAt Cop26 more than 120 countries covering more than 90% of forests endorsed a pledge on deforestation, committing to work to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. Brazil was among the signatories.",

Last week, the Competition and Markets Authority ordered JD to sell Footasylum, after concluding the takeover had reduced competition for high street shoppers.\nThe video recording, which has been seen by the Sunday Times, has sparked a fresh investigation by the competition regulator. The footage reportedly shows Cowgill sitting in his car with Barry Bown, the executive chairman of Footasylum, in a car park near Bury in Greater Manchester in July this year. There is no audio on the video.\nDuring its review, the CMA had instructed that while meetings between bosses of the two companies were allowed, confidential or commercially sensitive information should not be shared.\nBut in a statement released on Monday morning, JD Sports said Cowgill and Bown had known each other on a \u201cbusiness and personal basis for 25 years\u201d and that that it was \u201cnot unusual, or in any way suspicious or illegitimate, for them to meet from time to time, including in relation to the ongoing review by the Competition and Markets Authority\u201d.\n\u201cJD firmly believes that its actions in participating in this meeting do not amount to wrongdoing or a breach of the order and does not see how it would be reasonable to accuse JD of such,\u201d it said.\nThe sportswear company hit out at what it claimed was \u201chighly irregular and potentially illegal covert surveillance undertaken by a third party for their own interests\u201d.\n\u201cAny suggestions with regard to corporate governance breaches are totally refuted,\u201d it added.\nHowever, the competition regulator is understood to have seen the footage of the bosses\u2019 meeting, and is in the process of investigating whether it constitutes a breach of the interim order.\n\u201cThese rules are put in place to protect consumers and other businesses operating in that market as we investigate a merger. We take compliance very seriously and thoroughly investigate any potential breaches,\u201d a CMA spokesperson said. \u201cWhere there is clear evidence that a breach has occurred we do not hesitate to take action.\u201d\nJD said it had already notified the CMA about the discussions of the July meeting, and its purpose. A person with knowledge of the matter suggested that the information was passed on before the Sunday Times report was released.\nJD Sports said it was still committed to dividing its executive chairman role into two positions \u2013 chairman and chief executive \u2013 before the company\u2019s next annual general meeting in 2022 and was strengthening the board, including with a new independent non-executive director appointed in September. A second non-executive appointment was imminent, the retailer added.",

I got here at 7am this morning. They didn\u2019t start work until 9am,\u201d he said.\nOthers said that it took hours after the collapse occurred before rescue workers arrived at the scene. Witnesses said they saw workers watching YouTube videos to work out how to use the excavators to save lives, with the machines at times scooping up blood and body parts from the debris, before medical workers from the Nigerian Red Cross placed them into bags for possible identification.\n\u201cSee how aggressive they are? See how they are using caterpillars [excavators] on the site?\u201d said Oladele Aina, a construction worker from a nearby partly constructed apartment block, worried that the machines could harm any remaining survivors or dismember corpses. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing at all.\u201d\nAn expert on urban planning in Lagos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, condemned the rescue efforts. \u201cBuilding collapses happen semi-regularly, this has been an issue for years and years now. Not only is it that the government doesn\u2019t act against this issue; it doesn\u2019t seem like there has been any tangible improvement in the rescue operations after these terrible collapses.\n\u201cSo we aren\u2019t preventing the collapses and we aren\u2019t learning how to save lives,\u201d he said, with other experts saying heat signature equipment could have been used to locate people who were trapped.\nState authorities have set up an independent panel to investigate the cause of the collapse, with Lagos\u2019s governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, conceding \u201cmistakes were made from all angles\u201d.\nA six-member panel of experts had been appointed to \u201cbring closure to this event and ensure that justice is served\u201d, he said last week, with three days of mourning declared in Lagos between Thursday and Sunday.\nYet the inquiry has done little to temper anger oversuspected malpractice and corruption by a nexus of government officials and rich property developers.\nWhat caused the building collapse has not been determined. The head of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, Gbolahan Oki, was suspended by the state government following the collapse. He had earlier told reporters the building only had approval for 15 storeys, not 21.\nLabourers waiting at the site said it was common for subpar building materials to be used to cut corners.\nThe deputy governor confirmed last week that the development site was sealed in June this year for four months after it was discovered there were some problems in the construction process, before its approval was regranted.\nYet questions remain over whether the development was subject to proper scrutiny before it was reopened or whether failings were overlooked. Since the collapse, anger has built against the owner of the property, Femi Osibona, a prolific property developer in Nigeria who began his career in east London. Osibona was killed in the collapse, with his distraught friends identifying his body when it was retrieved on Thursday.\nIkoyi, where the collapse took place, is one of the most affluent parts of Nigeria, replete with both old and newly constructed luxury apartment blocks with flats selling for as much as millions of dollars.\nThe collapse has also brought into focus the conditions of workers and labourers on construction sites across Lagos, and particularly in Ikoyi, and whether authorities have failed to regulate the property industry or can be trusted to.",

Lawyers representing some of those who were injured have begun to file lawsuits.\nAccording to the Houston Chronicle, which reviewed videos and social media, people had begun to collapse by 9.39pm.

Seventeen people were taken to hospital, including 11 in cardiac arrest while more than 300 people were treated in a field hospital.\nThe legitimacy of the Cop26 climate summit has been called into question by civil society participants who say restrictions on access to negotiations are unprecedented and unjust.\nAs the Glasgow summit enters its second week, observers representing hundreds of indigenous, environmental, academic, climate justice and women\u2019s rights organisations, warn that excluding them from negotiating areas and speaking to negotiators could have dire consequences for millions of people.\nObservers act as informal watchdogs of the summit \u2013 the eyes and ears of the public during negotiations \u2013 to ensure proceedings are transparent and reflect the concerns of communities and groups most likely to be affected by decisions.\nBut their ability to observe, interact and intervene in negotiations on carbon markets, loss and damage and climate financing has been obstructed during the first week, the Guardian has been told.\n\u201cThe level of restrictions was unprecedented,\u201d said S\u00e9bastian Duyck, from the Centre for International Environmental Law. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming, because the relationships we build at the start of Cop are crucial to the work we do after.\u201d\n\u201cWithout our voices this risks the creation of rules that will continue to violate human, territorial and spiritual rights of indigenous peoples,\u201d said Eriel Deranger, an observer for Indigenous Climate Action.\nProminent Republicans are seizing on the victory of Glenn Youngkin in the Virginia gubernatorial race last week to call for a realignment of the party that would move beyond Donald Trump and his \u201cbig lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen.\nWhile most Republicans remain either in lockstep with, or silent about, the former president\u2019s campaign of misinformation surrounding his defeat by Joe Biden, a number of voices have begun tentatively to argue for a reboot.\nChris Christie, a longtime confidant of Trump, nonetheless called for the party to move beyond the former president\u2019s obsession with the last election.\n\u201cWe can no longer talk about the past and the past elections \u2013 no matter where you stand on that issue, no matter where you stand, it is over,\u201d said the former governor of New Jersey and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. \u201cEvery minute that we spend talking about 2020 \u2013 while we\u2019re wasting time doing that, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are laying ruin to this country.\u201d\nTrumpism without Trump appears to be gaining ground among Republicans in the wake of Youngkin\u2019s success in a state that has been trending Democratic.\nTrump, however, is hinting at another bid for the White House, and with his threat still hanging over the party that he will endorse primary challengers to anyone who defies him, many Republicans continue to act with extreme timidity.\nIn an apparent swipe at the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the anti-Trump Republican Liz Cheney said on Sunday it was \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d to suggest the deadly assault on the US Capitol on 6 January was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d attack.\nConspiracy theorists say \u201cfalse flag\u201d attacks are staged by the government to achieve its own ends. A documentary produced by Carlson for the Fox Nation streaming service, Patriot Purge, contains such a suggestion about the Capitol attack.\nFive people died around the events of 6 January, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden.\nTrump was impeached for inciting the attack but escaped conviction when sufficient Republican senators stayed loyal.\nWhat did Cheney say? She said: \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing that you hear people saying 9/11 is an inside job. It\u2019s un-American to be spreading those kinds of lies, and they are lies.\u201d\nDid she vote to impeach Trump? Yes and she is one of two Republican members of the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.\nRepublicans have condemned a new Covid mandate for large companies claiming it could have negative economic consequences. However, Biden\u2019s plan to get US companies with more than 100 or more workers to vaccinate their staff or bring in regular tests have been welcomed by public health groups.\nA missing teenage girl was rescued in the US after she used a hand gesture that signals distress or domestic violence to capture the attention of a passing driver. The 16-year-old was spotted travelling inside a silver Toyota near London, Kentucky, about 150 miles south-east of Louisville, on 4 November.\nSenior figures in Iraq believe a brazen drone attack on the home of Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, marks an unprecedented escalation between the country\u2019s leaders and Iran-backed militant groups attempting to overturn last month\u2019s election.\nThe world\u2019s only openly gay top\u2011flight men\u2019s footballer says he would be \u201cscared\u201d to play at the World Cup tournament in Qatar next year because of the emirate\u2019s harsh ban on homosexuality and legal penalties ranging from flogging to lengthy prison terms and execution.\nTesla\u2019s Frankfurt-listed shares fell about 9% in early trading on Monday as investors prepared for the chief executive Elon Musk\u2019s proposed sale of about a 10th of his holdings in the electric carmaker after his Twitter poll. Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stock if users of the social media network approved the proposal. The poll attracted more than 3.5m votes and 57.9% of people voted \u201cyes\u201d. As of 30 June, Musk\u2019s shareholding in Tesla came to about 170.5m shares and selling 10% would amount to close to $21bn based on Friday\u2019s close, according to Reuters calculations.\nIn a pandemic that has meant keeping 2 metres away from one another whenever possible, it appears that physical contact is beginning to return. Even handshakes are starting to make a comeback. \u201cWe are wired to respond to emotional touch,\u201d says Francis McGlone, a professor at Liverpool John Moores University. \u201cMy analogy is that [touch is] like a vitamin \u2013 if we are depleted, there are consequences in terms of our physical health. For many people, social distancing and lockdowns left them bereft of physical contact. Here, touch experts explain why it is so essential.\nAn increasing number of women are selling their eggs for as much as $20,000 a cycle to cover essential costs \u2013 but some have found other motivations and others have experienced negative consequences. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was matched with a family, met them, [and] spoke with them that I realized the impact,\u201d said Jordan Whaley Finnerty, who has donated four times. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize the lengths couples have to go through to have children.\u201d Being exposed to the parents\u2019 gratitude changed her mind. Now, the goodwill of element, not the money, is her favorite part.\nA handful of Republican members of Congress have arrived at the UN climate talks in Glasgow in an attempt to portray the party as engaged on the climate crisis, with this message already badly undermined by colleagues back in the US who have downplayed and even dismissed the impacts of global heating during the summit. \u201cRepublicans care deeply about the environment and preserving it for future generations,\u201d insisted John Curtis, a Republican congressman from Utah.\nWant more environmental stories delivered to your inbox?

        "content": "Manchester City are starting to get back on track, Jessie Fleming is in flying form for Chelsea and Spurs\u2019 planning is paying off\nThe new Everton manager Jean-Luc Vasseur\u2019s appeal for patience following his team\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Brighton might be seen as optimistic. \u201cThe project is long and we need to be patient\u201d, he said. One league game is not enough time to get a team up to speed with a new philosophy but it is hard to see why Vasseur will be afforded time when his predecessor Willie Kirk wasn\u2019t. Before Saturday\u2019s loss to Brighton, Everton dropped points against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal and, while it had been hoped they would be more competitive against those sides, it was perhaps naive of the club to expect a team that had undergone wholesale changes in the summer to go toe to toe with squads that have a much more established core. Everton face a problem that any team attempting to break into the top three will face; it takes time to build up a squad of players able to compete at the top, year after year, and it takes time to embed those players. In many ways Kirk has paid the price for an attempt to buy fast success. SW\nThe main talking point this season has been Manchester City\u2019s poor form. It is their worst start to the WSL but the manager, Gareth Taylor, has now started to steer their campaign back on track. At the weekend City recorded a 4-1 win over struggling Leicester City, despite going 1-0 down after a minute. They are seventh and, despite it being early in the season, are unlikely to win the league now. But if their results continue to improve they could still target that all-important Champions League qualifying top-three spot. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good feeling,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI think it was really important for us to get points on the board like we have.\u201d SR\nOlympic champion Jessie Fleming maintained top form in Chelsea\u2019s 1-0 win over Aston Villa, scoring the only goal of the game. Her effort may have been a straightforward one, a late tap-in past Hannah Hampton, but it added to her impressive stats this campaign. Fleming has two goals, one assist and an 85% pass rate success after six matches. The young player is developing well at Chelsea and manager Emma Hayes acknowledged as much post-match. \u201c[Villa] sit really low and you have to work hard to drag them out of the spaces,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWe did that really well in the first half with the runs from Jessie. The movement from Beth [England] was also good.\u201d SR\nTottenham\u2019s first point from seven games against Manchester United put them third in the league and is a big milestone for the north London side. True, Manchester United are not as formidable in attack as they have been in recent seasons, with Leah Galton and Kirsty Hanson struggling to make an impact, but Tottenham look a well-organised team with a plan all the players understand. It is not the teams splashing money on transfers that look most likely to break into the top three. Instead it is Tottenham and Brighton, two clubs reaping the rewards of having recruited managers, in Rehanne Skinner and Hope Powell, who understand how to get the best out of their players. As a former assistant coach with the national team and former England manager respectively, both are used to doing just that. SW\nUnlike Leicester, who are bottom, Birmingham have experience in the WSL but seem to be on a downward trajectory. A match against Reading presented the perfect opportunity for the club to gain valuable points with their opponents just one place ahead of them in the table before the match. They managed to hold Kelly Chambers\u2019 team off until the second half but then conceded three times. Scott Booth was appointed ahead of the season to change the club\u2019s fortunes but instead they seem to have regressed further. It may be that only Leicester can save them from relegation and there will be a tasty fixture for fans when the bottom two face each other next month. SR\nWhat a goal! \ud83d\ude0dKim Little scores again to make it 2-0 to Arsenal! \ud83d\udd25Will she get a hat-trick? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcfa Watch live on Sky Sports Football pic.twitter.com/tr8XOkxok2\nThe stars in Arsenal\u2019s squad make it easy to overlook the consistent and dependable captain Kim Little. However, she made her presence felt in their 4-0 win over West Ham as she scored twice to take her WSL tally to 50. She became one of the select group, also including her Arsenal teammate Vivianne Miedema, to reach the milestone and did so in 98 games. The former Scotland international was modest post-match, telling Sky Sports: \u201cMost importantly we got the win and the three points \u2026 We want to make sure we don\u2019t concede and I think we\u2019ve got that mentality right now.\u201d Arsenal have scored 50 goals this season across all competitions, to match Little\u2019s mark.

        "content": "Congolese workers describe a system of abuse, precarious employment and paltry wages \u2013 all to power the green vehicle revolution\n\nThe names Tesla, Renault and Volvo mean nothing to Pierre*. He has never heard of an electric car. But as he heads out to work each morning in the bustling, dusty town of Fungurume, in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s southern mining belt, he is the first link in a supply chain that is fuelling the electric vehicle revolution and its promise of a decarbonised future.\nPierre is mining for cobalt, one of the world\u2019s most sought-after minerals, and a key ingredient in the batteries that power most electric vehicles (EVs).\nHe says his basic wage is the equivalent of \u00a32.60 ($3.50) a day, but if he works through lunch and puts in hours of overtime, he can make up to about \u00a33.70. Not that lunch is worth waiting for: he claims he is given just two small bread rolls and a carton of juice.\n\u201cThe salary is very, very small. It gives me a headache \u2026 The mine makes so much and we make so little,\u201d he says.\nIf he takes a day off, he says money is deducted from his wages. If he is sick and misses more than two days in a month, more money is cut. \u201cYou can\u2019t even argue. If you do, you\u2019ll be fired,\u201d he says, squatting on the dirt floor of the bare brick shack he rents.\n\u201cThe relationship between us and the [mine] is like a slave and a master,\u201d says Pierre.\nStories of the harsh and dangerous working conditions endured by miners in the DRC\u2019s informal, or artisanal, cobalt mines \u2013 of child labour and miners being buried alive as tunnels cave in \u2013 have provoked an international outcry in recent years, forcing the western technology and automotive brands that rely on the mineral to look for ways to source \u201cclean\u201d cobalt, free from human rights abuses.\nSome companies in the cobalt supply chain have promised to stop sourcing from artisanal mines and instead get the mineral from large-scale industrial mines, which are seen as a safer option both for workers and corporate reputations.\nPierre is not working at an artisanal mine, however. He is employed, via a subcontractor, at Tenke Fungurume mine (TFM), one of the country\u2019s biggest industrial mines, which is 80% owned by the Chinese company China Molybdenum(CMOC).\nAn investigation by the Guardian has found that some workers, often employed through subcontractors, allege they are victims of severe exploitation, including wages as low as 30p an hour, precarious employment with no contracts, and paltry food rations. In a number of mines run by Chinese companies, workers made allegations of discrimination and racism reminiscent of the colonial era.\nThe Guardian has tracked the cobalt supply chain from TFM and other industrial mines through a number of refiners and battery makers to some of the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturers, including Tesla, VW, Volvo, Renault and Mercedes-Benz .\nWhile the cobalt supply chain is highly complex, all these car manufacturers identified by the Guardian can be linked to one or more of the industrial mines named by the Guardian through a small number of key refineries and battery makers.\nMany EV brands have made public commitments to \u201cresponsible sourcing\u201d of minerals, and some \u2013 notably Tesla \u2013 are using innovative ways to achieve this. Nevertheless, the Guardian\u2019s findings suggest how far the sector still has to go to ensure the shift to clean energy is not tainted by claims of workers\u2019 rights abuses.\nAs delegates meet at Cop26, the UN climate change conference in Glasgow, the transition from petrol to EVs is being talked about as a key step in reducing carbon emissions. Global sales of passenger EVs \u2013 excluding hybrids \u2013 are expected to soar from 3.3m in 2021 to 66m in 2040. In the UK, that growth will be driven by the government\u2019s ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2030.\nLast year, about 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt came from the DRC and the vast majority of that \u2013 93,000 out of 100,000 tonnes, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) \u2013 came from large-scale industrial mines.\nAlthough some battery and car manufacturers have reduced the amount of cobalt in their batteries, BMI says the volume of sales of cobalt into the sector will rise four or fivefold over the coming decade. The World Bank estimates that demand for cobalt production will increase 585% by 2050.\nThat should be good news for people in southern DRC, where the majority of the cobalt mines are located, but a report launched today by UK-based corporate watchdog Raid and Congolese lawyers from the Centre d\u2019Aide Juridico-Judiciaire, says many multinational mining companies \u2013 and the subcontractors they hire \u2013 create poorly paid jobs that keep workers in poverty. \n\u201cCobalt is an essential mineral for the green transition, but we must not turn away from the abusive labour conditions that taint the lithium-ion batteries needed for millions of electric vehicles,\u201d said Raid director Anneke Van Woudenberg\nKolwezi is the DRC\u2019s cobalt capital, a city so defined by mining that some communities sit on the rim of the giant craters that have been excavated in search of copper and cobalt. It is mining on a massive scale, highly mechanised and dependent on cutting-edge technology but powered by thousands of workers \u2013 more than 10,000 at TFM \u2013 who, like Pierre, are employed as mineral processors, drivers, mechanics, welders, security guards and general workers.\nIn the last 15 years, Chinese companies have begun to enter the mining business, buying out North American and European companies so that they now control the majority of the cobalt and copper mines in southern DRC. And with this change, Congolese workers say, has come abuse, discrimination and racism. They say they are insulted, in some cases beaten, and claim they are paid less than Chinese workers who do the same job. They allege that Chinese supervisors disregard their experience and put production before safety.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being treated in a very bad way by the Chinese. I\u2019m a victim of assault myself. I was slapped across the face four times,\u201d says Mutamba, another worker at TFM.\nOne Congolese worker at TFM described sitting through a two-hour meeting in Chinese, only to be given a two-minute translation at the end.\n\u201cWe feel humiliated and embarrassed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way they are treating our people, you can\u2019t believe. We are just expecting them to have respect for human life, instead of using people like slaves.\u201d\nTenke\nFungurume Mine / CMOC\nCMOC is committed to\n\u201cestablishing fair employment practices and treating all\nindividuals with dignity and respect, with zero tolerance to all forms of\nunlawful discrimination and harassment\u201d. The Employment Policy\nissued by the Company has clear\nrules regarding this. We comply with the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and\nRights at Work\u00a0and the eight fundamental Conventions of the\nInternational Labour Organization, and\nthe laws and regulations in countries where we operate. We develop appropriate\nregulations and preventative measures to ensure the elimination of\nall forms of child labour, forced\nlabour, and violations of human rights or international humanitarian\nlaw during the hiring process,\nwhile employed, and at the end of employment. We also deliver the\nsame to oursuppliers and\nmonitor their compliance periodically.\nWe are devoted to\nproviding safe, healthy, and decent work environment to all employees\nand attach great\nimportance to protecting the rights of employees. We value and\nencourage localization as\nshown by the 88% Congolese (including contractors) in our total work\nforce as of the second quarter\nof 2021.\nIn terms of labor\nrelations, we are committed to observing ILO conventions and local\nlabor policies and laws\nbased on a fair employment framework. All employees are entitled with\nrights of freedom of\nassociation and collective bargaining. All DRC national employees are\nmembers of unions. The\nCollective Bargaining Agreement we signed with unions covers all\nCongolese employees, the\ncontent of which explicitly clarified working hours, salaries, and\nbenefits that are in line with market\nstandards and requirement by laws.\nOn HSE perspective,\nTFM receives annual OHSAS 18001 independent audit to ensure safety performance.\nEveryone in and out of the mine site, including our own employees and contractors\u2019\nemployees, need to attend induction trainings to get onboard.\nInduction trainings, including specific\nmodules on safety, human rights, and grievance hotline, are intended\nto ensure that all employees\nand contractors are equipped with necessary knowledge and skills and understand and\ncomply with the Zero Tolerance Rules of TFM. In this regard, we treat\nour employees and\ncontractors equally, registering contractor performance as well in\nour safety records. The\ncontracts signed with suppliers/contractors also encompass Supplier\nCode of Conducts and other\nESG terms including on HSE, human rights, and community.\nMOC values\ncommunications with employees. The grievance systems of our global\nbusiness units are accessible\nto all employees and contractors and welcome involvement and feedback from all employees.\nTFM has a dedicated grievance system to record and resolve\nstakeholders\u2019 concerns and\ncompliance issues, including employees\u2019 concerns regarding work\nconditions, and will make\nverifications on issues filed.\nDue to absence of\ndetails related to what you mentioned in your email, I\u2019m not able\nto verify, but to do\nso, I\u2019m open to any further information that you may provide. I\nwould like to stress that CMOC\nmanages its labor relations in line with established rules and\ninternational standards. Let me\nshare with you a most recent demonstration of our practice: in the\nMSCI ESG rating report\nreleased in August 2021, CMOC is upgraded from BBB to A, a rating\nthat is among top tier of global\nmining companies. This manifests that we have maintained high\ninternational standards in areas\nincluding protection of labor rights and interests, safety, health,\nenvironmental protection, and\ncorporate governance.\nPlease note one\nimportant fact: since CMOC took over, TFM has acted in strict\ncompliance with laws and regulations\nand made significant contribution to fiscal revenue of the DRC and development of local\ncommunities. From start of production to end of June 2021, TFM had contributed a total\nof about USD3.48 billion to fiscal revenue of the DRC. Taxes paid and investment made in\nthe public sector by TFM is over 10% of total fiscal revenue of the\nDRC, providing 10,462\nlocal jobs and benefitting 21,150 local employees and their family\nmembers with healthcare\nservices. TFM makes substantial investment in infrastructure,\nlivelihood, and economic development\nof local communities every year since its start of production,\ninvesting over USD300 million\nin supporting utility projects and building public facilities\nincluding roadways, schools, hospitals, and training centers. During\nthe same time, towns of Tenke and Fungurume where TFM is located\nwitnessed a growth of population from 30,000 to over 400,000 and had\ndeveloped into a medium-sized cities of prosperity and vitality.\nSince acquisition completion in 2016, fiscal contribution to the DRC\ngovernment by TFM averaged USD400 million every year, way higher than\nthe USD130 million contribution when Freeport-McMoRan was shareholder\nof the mine.\n\nGlencore / KCC\nThank you for providing Glencore with the opportunity to respond to\nallegations on working conditions at the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC)\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC). Both Glencore and KCC\ntake these allegations very seriously.\nGlencore\u2019s\nCode\nof Conduct\nreflects our Purpose and Values and sets out the key principles and\nexpectations for how our employees must behave in their day-to-day\nactivities. At Glencore, we all commit to the Code \u2013 regardless of\nwhere we are or what we do. All of us are accountable for living up\nto Glencore\u2019s Values, incorporating the Code into our lives and\nencouraging our colleagues to do the same.\nKCC uses contractors\nfor specialist activities and for temporary work \u2013 it does not use\ncontractors for its core activities, which its direct employees carry\nout. Its terms and conditions with its contractor companies align\nwith DRC\u2019s labour legislation and set out clear expectations for\nthe treatment of workers. KCC has a dedicated enterprise development\nprogram that is dedicated to contracting local Congolese businesses\nand to support them in developing into a sustainable operation.\nKCC monitors\ncompliance with the terms and conditions of its contracts and, when\nmade aware of concerns, its management raises these concerns with its\ncontractor companies\u2019 management teams. In these cases, KCC works\nwith the contractor company to address concerns; however, in the\nevent that progress is insufficient, KCC will review and, if\nappropriate, terminate the contract.\nAs an example, in\n2021, KCC became aware that employees of a global contractor company,\nwhose contract ceased due to the reduction of project activities\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic, did not receive their wages to the end\nof their employment term. In this instance, KCC engaged with the\ncontractor company, voiced its concerns and the employees received\nthe correct payment. Similarly, this month, contractors demonstrated\nat KCC on discrepancies in wages paid for similar jobs. In this\ninstance, KCC spoke with the contractor company to understand better\nthe issues and to encourage engagement between the management team\nand its workers. The management team subsequently addressed the\ndiscrepancies.\nKCC provides food\nand water to all its direct employees and to certain contractors,\ndepending on the agreement with the specific contractor company.

In all cases, KCC will provide water to any employee\nor contractor on an as required basis.\nKCC\ninvestigates the concerns that it receives.

Our Supplier Standards apply to\nany individual, organisation or company that provides, sells or\nleases materials directly to Glencore companies, including goods and\nservices. These also apply to KCC\u2019s suppliers. The Supplier\nStandards also form the base of our risk-based supply chain due\ndiligence programme, which aligns with the Organization of Economic\nCooperation and Development\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance for\nResponsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and\nHigh-Risk Areas\nKCC\u2019s\nEnterprise Development Process works across its procurement programme\nto support, encourage and engage Congolese-owned businesses,\nincluding labour. KCC\u2019s supplier agreements and contracts include\nstandard terms and conditions on the requirement for robust health\nand safety management programmes, upholding respect for human rights,\nthe prevention of child labour, good working conditions and fair\nsalaries.\nIn\naddition, in 2020, KCC successfully participated in the Responsible\nMinerals Initiative\u2019s (RMI) pilot audit programme for its\nResponsible Minerals Assurance Process. Supplier due diligence was a\ncore part of this third-party assessment. The report on this\nassessment is available on our website.\nIt should also be noted that KCC is the only mining operation in\nAfrica to receive RMI certification for the 2020-21 period.\nFair\npay and strong union representation\nGlencore\u2019s\nEquality\nof Opportunity Policy\nrequires our assets to provide fair and equitable conditions of\nemployment to their employees, in line with local requirements. We\nbelieve in the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and\ncontribution.\nWe\nprovide all employees with equal access to pay calculations and\ntransparency of pay in line with their agreed and lawful terms and\nconditions of employment for work performed in line with global\nstandards and local requirements. We provide employees with access to\nabsence, redundancy, and retirement provision in accordance with\nlocal standards.\nKCC\nhas established salary banding that is based on the skills required\nfor the work performed. All of KCC\u2019s employees are paid above the\nDRC\u2019s minimum wage and receive additional benefits and allowances,\nincluding but not limited to medical support, meals, school fees,\nhousing allowance, family allowance, leave absence payment (in\naddition to labour law leave requirement).\nKCC\u2019s\nstandard terms of engagement for its contractors stipulates\nconditions in line with DRC legislation and fair remuneration.\n\u00a0All\nof our assets, including KCC, recognise and uphold the rights of\ntheir workforces to freedom of association and collective\nrepresentation. \u201cRespect workforce rights to lawful freedom of\nassociation and collective bargaining\u201d is in KCC\u2019s contract terms\nand conditions with its service providers. At KCC, 96% of its\nemployees belong to a union and the KCC team meets regularly with\nunion representatives.\nHuayou\nCobalt / CDM\nCDM\nstrictly abides by DRC laws and regulations, we respect human rights\nand fulfil best labor practice.\n1.\nAll the workers of our company are directly recruited through formal\nrecruitment channels. We have never recruited workers through\nsub-contractors or third parties.\n2.\nThe company's way to calculate the payroll fully conforms to the\nrequirements of local laws, and the wages of general employees are\nmuch higher than the local minimum wage standard.\n3.\nThe company signs formal employment contracts with employees in\naccordance with local labour laws.\n4.\nAt the start of Covid outbreak, the DRC government did not put\nforward a clear policy and guidance on Covid pandemic prevention and\ncontrol, in order to protect the employees' life and health, the\ncompany immediately established Employee Protection Proposal\nreferring to the effective prevention measures of PRC and other\nmining enterprises\u2019 Covid pandemic prevention practices, and\ncombining local actual situation of DRC, we adopted a policy of\nhealthy and safe operation, implementing disinfection of the facility\nto ensure that workers work in a safe and virus-free environment.\nLater, our company made relevant adjustments accordingly after the\nDRC government put forward relevant Covid pandemic prevention\npolicies.\n5.\nSince the establishment of our factory, we have made a lot of\ncontributions to the surrounding communities. Every year, we spend a\nlot of money on the community. At the same time, we organized\nvillagers to carry out agricultural planting training, agricultural\neducation and farming, and cooperated with Non-Governmental\norganizations to conduct free consultations for villagers. During the\nCovid pandemic, we also made pandemic prevention speeches to\nvillagers, and donated pandemic prevention materials, masks, alcohol\nand gloves to villagers for many times.\n\nAs for the\nallegations mentioned in the e-mail, much of the information received\nby the Guardian is not in accordance with the actual situation, which\nwill have a negative impact on our company. We hope the Guardian can\ncollect information in a more precise, careful, discerning and\nresponsible manner, and then provide a convincing report.\nRenault\nFollowing\nyou request, please find below Renault\u2019s responses regarding the\nquestions you have raised.\nVolvo\nThe\nallegations put forward by the Guardian are serious. We are not aware\nof these issues taking place in our supply chain. Volvo Cars places\nstrict sustainability requirements on our business partners, and has\nmeasures in place to both secure responsibly sourced cobalt for our\nbatteries and improve the situation on the ground for mine workers in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nVW\nThese\nare serious allegations, many of which would also violate our Code of\nConduct for Business Partners. We are currently considering the\nopening of a Grievance case based on these information.\nWe\nare requesting from our direct suppliers and their supply chains to\ndisclose the upstream supply chain and to rule out the possibility of\nany human rights violations as per the OECD guideline\u2019s procedure.\nObligatory\nsustainability rating for all direct suppliers ensure that human\nrights, environmental and corruption risks can be promptly identified\nand ruled out. The basis for that are documents that every supplier\nmust submit to us and on-site checks, if needed.\nOn\nthe issue of responsible cobalt supply chain for our batteries we use\nthe following approach:\nVolkswagen\nitself does not procure cobalt directly. Cobalt itself is purchased\nby our suppliers for their business processes and products in a\nsupply chain that has up to 9 levels and in countries such as the DR\nCongo. Parts of the Cobalt in VW Groups battery supply chains also\noriginates in the DR Congo.\nWe\nare aware of the mining conditions in Congolese small-scale mining\nand reject child labor or inadequate environmental or social welfare\nstandards in mining. We understand that small-scale mining in the DR\nCongo represents a livelihood for many people. Without minimum\nstandards we cannot \u2013 not least for legal reasons \u2013 accept any\nmaterial from small-scale mines.\nThe\nVolkswagen Group joined the \u201cCobalt for Development\u201d project in\nSeptember 2020. Together with other partners from industry, we are\nworking to improve the working and living conditions of the local\npopulation in the DR Congo.\nVolkswagen\nengages in improving working conditions in artisanal cobalt mines in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo (volkswagenag.com)\nIn\nregard to industrial mining production from the DRC we also look for\nopportunities to increase the sustainability performance of the mines\nin the far end of our supply chains. This is why we are addressing\nthis topic in our contractual requirements with our battery\nsuppliers, referencing international best practices and this is why\nwe are currently piloting a sustainability audit at one industrial\nmine site in the DRC. Through this pilot project we want to better\nunderstand the sustainability performance of the mines in high-risk\ncountries and we intend to trigger positive change on the ground\nthrough corrective-action-plans for the assessed mine site.\nWe\nwork closely with our direct suppliers to identify the exact origin\nof cobalt in the supply chain.\u00a0 That is done using forensic\naudits, in which we work with an external service provider to obtain\ntransparency right down to the source of the raw material. For\nexample, suppliers and subcontractors in our cobalt supply chain are\naudited so as to ensure responsible practices throughout the supply\nchain. In the event of irregularities \u2013 violation of our standards\n(defined in the \u201cCode of Conduct for Business Partners\u201d) \u2013 we\ntake appropriate, quick and resolute action to ensure sustainability\nin our supply chain.\nWe\nreport transparently and regularly on our activities in the field of\nresponsible procurement of battery raw materials such as cobalt in\nthe annual\nVolkswagenGroupResponsibleRawMaterialsReport2020.pdf\n(volkswagenag.com)\u00a0which\nwas published in 2021 for the first time.\nMercedes-Benz\n/ Daimler\nOver the course of the investigation, workers interviewed by the Guardian said they deeply resented the way they were treated, but felt powerless to protest. \u201cIt\u2019s a shocking situation, but I can\u2019t leave the job because there is no other choice,\u201d says one. \u201cWhere can I get another job?\u201d\nA spokesperson for CMOC, which majority owns TFM, said the company adheres to a number of international labour conventions and local labour laws. Since it acquired the mine in 2016, CMOC said it has contributed an average of \u00a3296m a year to the country\u2019s revenue. \u201cWe are devoted to providing a safe, healthy and decent work environment to all employees and attach great importance to protecting the rights of employees,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nMining for cobalt and copper is a vital source of income for DRC\u2019s government and creates tens of thousands of jobs \u2013 with good wages for many \u2013 in a region with few other employment opportunities. But in some mines the majority of workers \u2013 almost 70% at TFM, for example \u2013 are hired through sub-contractors.\nThe use of subcontractors can leave workers in an extremely precarious position: often hired on short-term contracts, or no contract at all, with limited benefits, low pay and the threat of termination always hanging over them.\nJosu\u00e9 Kashal, a lawyer for Centre d\u2019Aide Juridico-Judiciaire, a local organisation that represents miners, says the use of subcontractors can lead to the big mines being able to avoid accountability.\nIn his small office in Kolwezi, Kashal shows the Guardian a list of what he claims are more than 50 subcontractors that have been used by the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) mine, which is owned by the Swiss commodities and mining giant Glencore.\n\u201cGlencore is using many subcontracted workers, so employees depend on the subcontractor, not Glencore. This way they don\u2019t have responsibility and can end a contract at any time,\u201d says Kashal.\nWhile some workers said they hoped to get hired directly by KCC, saying it offered better wages than other mines, 44% of KCC\u2019s workers are employed through sub-contractors. The price is paid by men like Luc. \u201cI started on \u00a380 a month while working as a security guard at KCC. Then KCC terminated the contract with the subcontractor and I suddenly lost my job, along with 600 other guards,\u201d he says.\nLuc was recently rehired by another security firm at the mine, but says he is still earning less than \u00a3140  a month. \u201cThe main companies are treating the subcontractors well, but the subcontractors don\u2019t treat workers well. The mining companies are benefitting a lot, not the local people,\u201d he says.\nGlencore said KCC only uses sub-contractors for specialist work or temporary contracts and monitors compliance with the terms of its contracts. \u201cIn 2021, KCC became aware that employees of a global contractor company, whose contract ceased due to the reduction of project activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, did not receive their wages to the end of their employment term. In this instance, KCC engaged with the contractor \u2026 and the employees received the correct payment,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nIn June 2020, Tesla signed a long-term deal to source cobalt from Glencore for its new \u201cgiga-factories\u201d in Berlin and Shanghai. Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but in its latest impact report, the company says it procures cobalt only from producers in the DRC that meet its responsible sourcing standards. To avoid its material being \u201ccontaminated\u201d by cobalt from other sources as it passes along the supply chain, it is \u201cstored in clearly marked, segregated areas of the plant and is toll processed on lines dedicated for Tesla\u201d, the report says. Two mineral experts told the Guardian this process is likely to be rigorous.\nCovid has compounded the already poor labour conditions endured by many workers. The community of Kawama stretches along one side of the main road south of Lubumbashi. On the other side stands the Congo Dongfang International Mining (CDM) mine and refinery.\nWhen the pandemic started, many CDM workers were confined to the mine for three months until the Congolese government compelled the company to release them. Koffi, who worked at the mine as a security guard, told the Guardian he shared a hall with 80 others, with two workers sharing a mattress laid on a wooden board and propped up on bricks. \u201cI felt like a prisoner. I didn\u2019t have any freedom,\u201d he says.\nIn interviews with the Guardian, some CDM workers say they are employed for as little as \u00a388  a month. \u201cPayslips\u201d seen by the Guardian were written only in Chinese on a pencil-thin strip of paper. \nCDM is wholly owned by Huayou Cobalt, a Chinese conglomerate with interests in every step of the cobalt supply chain, from mining to cathode production. Renault and Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, name CDM among their suppliers.\nHuayou Cobalt said CDM \u201cadopted a policy of healthy and safe operation\u201d at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic until the government put forward its own pandemic prevention policies. It said all workers were paid in line with local labour laws. CDM has made significant contributions to the local community, Huayou Cobalt said, including organising agricultural education, building and renovating schools, setting up medical clinics and providing water and electricity to local villages.\nBut there appears to be little sign of that in Kawama, a collection of red brick shacks with corrugated iron roofs held down by rocks. A woman heaves a bicycle laden with yellow water drums along a dry dirt track, a young boy helping to push from behind.\n\u201cThere is no drinking water, no electricity, no school, no healthcare,\u201d claims Koffi. \u201cOur community is right next to CDM, but they don\u2019t do anything for us.\u201d\nRenault, Volvo VW and Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, responded saying they recognised the importance of responsible mineral sourcing, took the allegations seriously and would discuss the findings with their suppliers.\n*All names have been changed",

When the Guardian visited the address, staff working in the building said they had not heard of the organisation.\n  The lack of clarity over the source of these donations has raised questions over the use of what is alleged to be hard-to-trace \u201cdark money\u201d by anti-independence campaigners in Scotland and pro-union groups in Northern Ireland, where the identities of donors are obscured by the use of unincorporated associations.\n  The commission has previously fined unincorporated associations that funded prominent Scottish Conservatives. The Scottish Unionist Association Trust (Suat) donated \u00a3364,000 to Tory candidates but failed to properly report all its funding, and was fined \u00a31,800 in 2019. Irvine Unionist Club was fined \u00a3400 in 2018 after not properly reporting donations of \u00a3100,000.\nPete Wishart, a Scottish National party MP and campaigner for stricter funding regulations, said there was an urgent need for the UK\u2019s political funding laws to be tightened up. Full transparency was needed over the sources of all political donations, particularly anonymous supporters of unincorporated associations.\n\u201cThe way unincorporated associations work is unacceptable. This needs close examination. Far more scrutiny by our electoral regulators is needed to check their background and make sure they\u2019re bona fide,\u201d he said.\nWillie Sullivan, the director of the Electoral Reform Society Scotland, said: \u201cAs the role of third-party campaigners continues to grow, their influence is being felt more clearly than ever before. But these funding practices are making it more difficult for voters to know who lies behind the campaigns they see and harder to ensure spending limits are not breached.\u201d\nScotland Matters is one of a number of small groups that have sprung up to motivate pro-UK voters, chiefly using Facebook, advertising hoardings and mailings to attack the Scottish National party and the case for independence.\n  Along with other pro-UK groups, it urged anti-independence voters to use tactical voting in important marginal constituencies \u2013 a tactic pollster John Curtice said helped prevent the SNP winning an overall majority in May.\n  The Ceet is an \u201cunincorporated association\u201d, a kind of non-profit membership club, according to Scotland Matters\u2019 returns to the Electoral Commission. Unincorporated associations are not regulated by Companies House and under existing regulations do not have to publish any financial information or details on their membership.\n  A spokesperson for Scotland Matters said it had \u201cprovided all the donor information required by the Electoral Commission as part of [a] post-campaign return to the commission\u201d. The Ceet has not responded to requests for a response. \n  Scotland Matters paid for Facebook ads through the pro-union pages \u201cSNP Exposed\u201d and \u201cThe UK Union Voice\u201d, as well as billboards before the Holyrood election.\nIt was set up by former activists in the official Better Together pro-UK campaign in the north east of Scotland during the 2014 independence referendum. Among its members are Prof Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, and David Bone, the director of a financial services firm in Glasgow.\n Two-thirds of donations to third-party campaigns in May\u2019s Holyrood elections were from unnamed sources, Guardian analysis has found. Campaigners received \u00a3165,000 in total \u2013 of which \u00a3111,000 came from anonymous sources, including the Ceet.",

        "content": "World\u2019s wealthiest person says proposed billionaires tax led to poll, the result of which sent price falling\nElon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and world\u2019s richest person, asked his 62.8 million Twitter followers over the weekend whether he should sell $21bn (\u00a315.5bn) worth of shares in the electric car company in order to pay tax. Tweeting he would \u201cabide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes\u201d, 58% of those who responded said \u201cyes\u201d, he should sell the shares, sending Tesla\u2019s share price down 5% in pre-market trading on Monday.\nWhy did he do it?Musk, who is sitting on a paper fortune of more than $338bn in Tesla and Space-X shares, proposed selling 10% of his Tesla shares in order to generate enough money to pay a proposed \u201cbillionaires tax\u201d on \u201cunrealised capital gains\u201d.\nHe said that as he did not \u201ctake a cash salary or bonus from anywhere\u201d the only way for him to \u201cpay taxes personally\u201d was to sell stock. However, he has made billions through a bonus scheme that granted him share options based on Telsa\u2019s share price performance.\nMuch is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.Do you support this?\nWhat is the billionaires tax and what are unrealised capital gains?Democrats in Congress have proposed tackling the yawning gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else by introducing a tax that billionaires would pay on the annual increase in the value of stocks and shares they own. At the moment, tax is only due when gains are \u201crealised\u201d, which means the holder only pays when they sell the stock and book the profit.\nRon Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon who chairs of the Senate finance committee, said the proposed tax, which would affect the 700 wealthiest people in the US, would \u201censure billionaires pay tax every year, just like working Americans\u201d.\n\u201cWhether or not the world\u2019s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn\u2019t depend on the results of a Twitter poll,\u201d he said of Musk\u2019s poll.\nWhy did the Tesla shares fall after the poll result?Almost 58% of the 3.5 million people who voted said Musk should sell the stake. The result was revealed on Sunday night (while the market was closed), however Tesla\u2019s shares fell by 7% pre-market trading on Monday, before recovering to about 5% down.\nMichael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cEarly indications suggest that the shares could fall sharply on the open [9:30am New York time 14:30 in London], however it\u2019s not as if Musk will now go and dump them on the open market. He could well drip feed them into the market over time.\n\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s got buy-in from his fans on social media will also dilute the impact of the sale and while we may see some early weakness, the shares are due a bit of a pullback anyway.\u201d\nDoes Musk have to stand by the vote, and sell the shares?Musk tweeted he would abide by the result said was \u201cprepared to accept either outcome\u201d.\nHe owns about 17% of Tesla\u2019s shares, which are worth about $208bn based on Friday\u2019s closing price. If he went ahead and sold a tenth of them in one go it could well depress the price. But this is unlikely, company bosses often use so-called blind brokering where the shares are sold on their behalf in small batches over a period of time. This means they can avoid claims they benefited from insider information in the timing of the sale.\nMusk could find himself in trouble with regulators if he does not follow through and sell the shares, because announcing his intention to sell has affected the share price.\nDoesn\u2019t he already have form for getting into trouble with regulators over his tweets?Yes. Musk and Tesla were fined $20m each in 2018 for misleading investors with tweets saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share and had \u201cfunding secured\u201d. The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the tweet, which sent the share price up by as much as 13.3%, violated securities laws. Musk\u2019s privatisation plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place. He also agreed to resign as chair of Tesla, and have the company\u2019s lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets.\nBut didn\u2019t Musk carry on tweeting anyway?Yes. After the SEC\u2019s 2018 action, he  tweeted that the $20m fines were \u201cworth it\u201d.

        "content": "Amid warnings of \u2018unprecedented\u2019 demand for hospital beds, six health workers describe how pressures are affecting them\nBed occupancy in England\u2019s hospitals has already reached normal peak winter levels, NHS leaders have warned.\nWhile modelling suggests that the rise in Covid infection levels appears to have stalled for now, the chief executive of NHS Providers has stressed that bed occupancy levels at acute hospitals are already at 94-96%, an \u201cunprecedented\u201d situation not normally seen until the middle of winter.\nIt comes as long waiting times in England\u2019s emergency departments are becoming normal, with the number of patients waiting for more than 12 hours increasing tenfold since 2019. Meanwhile, the NHS is undergoing a mounting workforce crisis and an enormous backlog of routine treatments that have built up over the pandemic.\nSix healthcare workers have described the pressures they are facing at the moment, highlighting staff shortages, rising wait times and abuse toward NHS workers.\nI\u2019ve lost seven receptionists this year, including one who left for a job in retail, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been one week where I\u2019ve had a full admin team, whether for Covid, other sickness, stress or leave. Staff resilience is at its lowest \u2013 a lot of them have been sick themselves during the pandemic or had family members being ill, and it feels as though there\u2019s a lack of awareness of that for a lot of patients. Patients are saying: \u201cI can go to a nightclub, so why can\u2019t I just come and see the doctor?\u201d There\u2019s been a misrepresentation \u2013 we\u2019ve not stopped face-to-face appointments. But obviously, we\u2019ve still got a lot of patients who are at high risk, so we can\u2019t have everyone in the waiting room.\nAbuse towards staff is through the roof. It\u2019s been bad since the start of this year \u2013 people seem to be so used to living in a service world where if you complain, you get a better service. There have been physical threats \u2013 there have been times where if a receptionist has left work for the day, we ask them to text us when they get home because you don\u2019t know who might be waiting outside. We\u2019ve got GPs who\u2019ve been here for decades who are running out of reasons not to retire and become a locum \u2013 they can make a lot of money right now.\nI\u2019ve thought I could leave the NHS and train to be an HGV driver and not have to deal with the abuse, the endless backlog of paperwork and constant change of protocols.\nOne of my colleagues worked a 19.5 hour shift recently, that\u2019s 7.5 hours late coming off their shift because they were queueing in the ambulance [outside the hospital] for eight hours. Ambulances are no longer just for accidents and emergencies; the problem is a shortage of other systems that used to be in place, which have been stripped back, like district care nurses and mental health services, so ambulances are now also doing the care in the community work and a lot of mental health jobs. It\u2019s creating really unsafe conditions for patients and staff.\nA lack of social care services mean we get a lot of calls out to elderly people who have fallen or who have infections because there\u2019s no one going round changing their catheters. Falls are categorised as low-priority incidents, which means by the time we get to them, the elderly person has often been on the floor for hours, in pain and desperate for the loo.\nIn the last couple of months, a four- to five-hour wait in the ambulance has become standard. It used to be an hour. There\u2019s a lot of time-wasting calls, people ringing up with things that don\u2019t need an ambulance, and you\u2019ve got people who can\u2019t get GP appointments. At the start of Covid, people were just coping and not calling ambulances but as things get back to \u201cnormal\u201d, people are expecting normal service everywhere. I think a lot of paramedics are leaving because it\u2019s just too much. The frustration of not seeing this problem resolved is quite demoralising.\nAfter low numbers of A&E attendances during lockdown, we\u2019ve seen a sharp rise following the end of restrictions over summer. We got very busy, very quickly and we\u2019re not staffed to see that number of people. It\u2019s the usual A&E stuff \u2013 heart attacks, strokes, car accidents \u2013 as well as a lot of overspill from people who can\u2019t access primary care services. They go to the nearest A&E because then they know they\u2019ll get seen face-to-face, and that\u2019s led to rising waits and a lot of pressure on our services. About a third of our daily footfall could be seen by primary care \u2013 things like long-term health issues, high blood pressure, rashes. After not having any Covid walk-ins over spring, the numbers have crept up over summer, but it\u2019s not a deluge in A&E.\nThere are shortages of nurses and doctors in emergency medicine. We\u2019re working flat out. We\u2019ve got long waiting times and that really impacts on the staff \u2013 we can\u2019t give the quality of service we want to give to our patients. We\u2019ve had six nurses resign in the last couple of months, and trained nurses are hard to find, so losing them is a big blow \u2013 it\u2019s tricky to replace them quickly. The physical fatigue from working in a very pressured environment has become more intense and more frequent. There are no lulls, there\u2019s no kind of time to regenerate and get your breath back. It\u2019s just constant, 24 hours a day. And then there\u2019s the moral injury of not being able to provide the service that you want to provide for the patients \u2013 that does really hurt people. Seeing 10- to 12-hour waits is no longer unusual.\nWe are seeing higher numbers of attendances through the children\u2019s emergency department than we\u2019ve ever seen before and the numbers go up week on week. We\u2019ve been seeing the winter stuff early, which was a post lockdown effect \u2013 children have been locked away for 18 months and haven\u2019t had contact with all of normal coughs and colds and viruses around so we\u2019ve had a surge of winter viruses. We\u2019ve also got a generation of under-twos who have never been ill before, and who have no immunity to normal respiratory viruses. We\u2019re routinely having wait times of between four and eight hours overnight at the moment, which for the children\u2019s department is worse than ever.\nIn teenagers the biggest rise has been in mental health presentations. We\u2019ve seen a lot higher numbers than we would normally expect to see for this time of year of young people with self-harm and overdoses. Normally, these patients may be briefly admitted on to a normal paediatric ward, but not for more than a night before going on to be managed in the community or a mental health unit \u2013 but those beds are very hard to come by at the moment. So patients get stuck in paediatric wards.\nI\u2019ve seen more \u201cred\u201d levels of staffing in the last month than I\u2019ve seen in a long time, not least because we have lots of staff with school-age kids and lots of kids are off with Covid at the moment. I have four nurses off sick with stress \u2013 this isn\u2019t normal, it would normally be none.\nPressure on the intensive therapy unit (ITU) has started to really pick up over the last three weeks. It\u2019s Covid as well as trauma patients \u2013 people with injuries from bad falls, car accidents. We\u2019re massively overcrowded and are having to push into other units, which aren\u2019t made for critical care patients \u2013 like we had to do in the second wave. We\u2019re expecting to be hit a bit later down the line, as patients have to deteriorate before they get to us. If we do get flu patients and Covid patients, that will be a major problem.\nMost of the Covid patients we\u2019re seeing in ITU are unvaccinated \u2013 we\u2019re seeing anti-vaxxers, as well as people who have recently come to the UK and haven\u2019t had a vaccine yet, pregnant patients and immunosuppressed people, including cancer patients and people who have had organ transplants. We\u2019ve pretty much always got one nurse to two patients, which isn\u2019t normal, it should be one to one, and now we\u2019re starting to have to triple people up \u2013 three patients to one nurse.\nWe\u2019ve got a massive loss of staff to sickness \u2013 quite a lot of us have been off with Covid. The other day we were down by 10 nurses on a shift. The majority are off with stress or having to self-isolate because of their kids. It\u2019s hard because you feel quite guilty if you don\u2019t go into work, so there\u2019s always that pressure there. Most days managers are asking if people are free to cover shifts. We lost a lot of staff during the second wave because people realised it\u2019s going to be going on for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s always been a constant joke that we\u2019d be better off working at Aldi, but I think recently a lot of people have actually looked at these jobs a little bit more.\nWe are unable to discharge people once they\u2019re well enough to leavehospital because of the lack of care workers, both in care homes and in the community. This has got worse in the last two to three months. The other week we had more than 30 people at once considered \u201cmedically optimised\u201d but unable to leave hospital because of the shortage. This is three times the number we had six months ago.\nCare home providers are being picky with which patients they agree to take on \u2013 they don\u2019t want people with high-level needs, we see providers rejecting people because they\u2019re low on the ground with staff and demand for care is so high that they can cherrypick who they take. This ends up with people with high care and support needs remaining in hospital indefinitely.\nOn average, the wait is two weeks before patients who need care can be discharged at my hospital, but there have been cases where patients have been waiting as long as eight weeks. It\u2019s felt like winter pressure all year round and we haven\u2019t even hit the peak \u2013 it\u2019s only going to get worse. We\u2019ve got fantastic people who are working above and beyond but it\u2019s just this lack of provision.",

The defendant claimed the victim had taken the knife to the scene and he \u201clost control\u201d when the younger boy attempted to stab him, but jurors dismissed his argument and concluded he was \u201cmotivated by anger\u201d.\nSentencing the teenager on Monday, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told him: \u201cMarcel Grzeszcz, in the early hours of Saturday 12 December 2020, you lured Roberts Buncis to a wooded area of Boston where you carried out a savage and brutal attack upon him with a knife which you had brought to the scene, in the course of which you made a determined effort to remove his head, before leaving his body for others to find later that same morning.\u201d\nThe judge said there was \u201ca significant degree of planning and premeditation\u201d involved in the attack, with Grzeszcz turning up with a large knife and latex gloves.\nWhile Grzeszcz may not have initially intended to kill him, \u201cgiven the number and nature of the injuries which you inflicted upon the deceased, there came a time when you did intend to kill him and proceeded to do so\u201d, the judge said.\nThe judge lifted a reporting restriction barring the naming of Grzeszcz following an application by the PA Media news agency.\nThe trial previously heard that Grzeszcz was forced to leave St Nicholas primary after bringing a knife on to the premises and was sent to a pupil referral unit (PRU). He was later excluded from high school for selling drugs both in and out of school and had started at another PRU the day before Roberts was found dead.\nGiving his ruling on the decision to lift the anonymity order, the judge said: \u201cThe balance is strongly in favour of the principle of open justice \u2026 rather than the accused\u2019s welfare, which is of more limited significance in the context of this extremely serious case.\u201d\nIn a short victim impact statement read to the court on behalf of Roberts\u2019s father, Edgars Buncis, he said: \u201cHow do I put into words how I feel? This is all wrong. No father should ever have to bury their son. Nothing is a reason for this. I have lost my destination and my purpose. My life is in a cemetery. I feel empty and nothing will change this.\u201d\nRoberts would have turned 13 two days after he was killed.",

She said: \u201cYet another ugly side of an activity some call \u2018sport\u2019.\u201d\nThe RSPCA called the footage \u201creally upsetting\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will always look into complaints made to us about animal welfare. We would urge anyone with first-hand information about this incident to contact us.\u201d\nThe Hunting Office told ITV News it \u201cexpects the highest level of animal welfare at all times \u2013 both on and off the hunting field \u2013 and condemns the actions taken by this individual, who is not a member of the hunting associations\u201d.\nHertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs said it filmed the incident on Saturday while observing the Cottesmore hunt, which is based in Rutland and claims to trace its heritage back to the 17th century. The group said the incident demonstrated \u201cviolence running through their veins\u201d.\nAccording to ITV News, the hunt said it did not condone the actions shown in the video \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d and added: \u201cWe will be reminding all of our supporters that this will not be tolerated.\u201d\nThe reputation of the UK\u2019s hunting community was damaged last month, when a prominent huntsman was convicted of encouraging others to hide the illegal hunting of live foxes behind a \u201csmokescreen\u201d of trail hunting.\nMark Hankinson, the director of the Masters of the Foxhounds Association, was found to have encouraged people to commit an offence during two webinars broadcast to more than 100 of the organisation\u2019s members which were obtained by hunt saboteurs, who passed them to the media and the police.\nTrail hunting involves a trail layer dragging a rag coated in an animal scent for the hunt to follow instead of a live fox.\nBut Hankinson told members: \u201cWe need to have clear, visible, plausible trail laying being done throughout the day \u2026 It\u2019s a lot easier to create a smokescreen if you have got more than one trail layer operating, and that is what it\u2019s all about, trying to portray to the people watching that you are going about your legitimate business.\u201d",

The company\u2019s shares fell close to 5% on Monday.\nThe poll attracted more than 3.5m votes and 57.9% of people voted \u201cyes\u201d.\nMusk had said previously he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.\n\u201cI was prepared to accept either outcome,\u201d Musk said, after the voting ended. Market participants expected speculators would try to front-run his selling.\nTesla\u2019s share price is highly volatile and has fallen more than 5% nine times this year, according to FactSet, a financial data company.\nAs of 30 June, Musk\u2019s shareholding in Tesla came to about 170.5m shares and selling 10% would amount to close to $21bn based on Friday\u2019s close, according to Reuters calculations.\nIncluding stock options, Musk owns a 23% stake in Tesla, the world\u2019s most valuable car company.

Despite announcing he was stepping down from the Commons after a government-backed bid to save him from suspension sparked uproar from the public and senior Tories, the scrutiny of his work for Randox and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods continues. A new register of MPs\u2019 interests also revealed some are making up to \u00a3400,000 on top of their taxpayer-funded salary. Paterson\u2019s repeated breaches of the rules by meeting and messaging ministers and officials has sparked soul-searching by those who want to restore trust in parliament.\nProposed solution: the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is reportedly throwing his weight behind giving MPs\u2019 more opportunity to appeal if they are found to have broken the rules, in exchange for launching a review into how those elected to parliament can make vast sums of money from other jobs. An analysis by the Guardian found more than 30 MPs would be hit if a rule were introduced barring them taking up positions as consultants or advisers.\nThere has been no shortage of allegations that Tory MPs helped associates gain lucrative Covid contracts. Former health secretary Matt Hancock was even found to have acted unlawfully when his department failed to reveal details of contracts it had signed during the pandemic. Attention was drawn to Paterson because of work he did on behalf of two firms, one of which was Randox. The Department of Health has reportedly refused to release minutes of a phone call last spring between Paterson and the health minister Lord Bethell, which took place just days before the company got a \u00a3133m deal to supply and analyse test kits.\nProposed solution: the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has demanded Johnson commit to a \u201cfull-transparent investigation\u201d into the vast sum of taxpayers\u2019 money that he said was handed to Randox \u201cwithout competition or tender\u201d. Starmer added the public needed confidence Paterson\u2019s \u201cpaid advocacy did not influence these decisions\u201d.\nAfter months of dodging questions about how Johnson paid up to \u00a3200,000 for a refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, it was eventually revealed that a Tory peer and donor \u2013 Lord Brownlow \u2013 had initially stepped in to settle the bill. The prime minister was cleared of breaking the ministerial code, but his standards adviser, Lord Geidt, said Johnson \u201cunwisely\u201d proceeded with the redecoration \u201cwithout more rigorous regard for how this would be funded\u201d.\nThe row is now back in the headlines because the Electoral Commission, which scrutinises political party spending and donations, has completed its own probe and handed its findings to Conservative headquarters to give the party an opportunity to respond. The parliamentary standards commissioner said she would hold off launching her own investigation so as not to prejudice the existing one, and some believe Johnson\u2019s attempt to hobble the commissioner was linked to the upcoming inquiry she may launch into his flat payments. The opaqueness with which Downing Street treated questions about the issue raise serious questions about how much influence Tory donors funding the prime minister\u2019s lifestyle have.\nProposed solution: Johnson is facing calls not to reform the standards system until it has completed any investigation into him.\nRather more recently, attention turned to who paid for Johnson\u2019s post-Conservative conference holiday to southern Spain. No 10 said he would not declare in the register of MPs\u2019 interests the free luxury getaway at a villa belonging to the family of Zac Goldsmith \u2013 a Tory peer \u2013 meaning the prime minister will not have to detail the value of the gift. Johnson has been rapped previously by the standards commissioner for making incomplete or late declarations in the register of MPs\u2019 interests. Although Johnson has registered the holiday in the register of ministerial interests, this meant he did not have to detail its monetary value \u2013 unlike the requirement for entries in the MPs\u2019 interest document. By not declaring the value, Johnson has opened himself up to criticism he put Goldsmith in the Lords and is now on the receiving end of his financial endowment.\nProposed solution: Declaring the value would show Johnson believed in the importance of transparency, which in turn would improve confidence in the propriety of his relationships with benefactors.\nIt is not just financial gain under the spotlight, but power and influence. This weekend it emerged Paterson will get to keep his Commons pass, as many ex-MPs do. However, he and others still allowed free access to parts of parliament are not obliged to declare their financial interests \u2013 meaning they would be able to catch legislators in the corridors and bend their ear on certain topics or business interests.\nProposed solution: Having a register of interests for those ex-politicians with lobbying jobs who still get access to parliament is one way mooted to solve this issue.\nMuch criticism was levelled at Johnson granting arch-Brexiteer Goldsmith a seat in the Lords, immediately after he lost his seat in the 2019 election. However, the thorny issue returned this weekend, when it was reported that 15 of the last 16 Conservative party treasurers have been offered a seat in the House of Lords, having each donated more than \u00a33m to the Tories. No 10 has also refused to rule out Paterson being handed a peerage \u2013 though they have since retreated from this position and briefed he will not be appointed to sit in the House of Lords. Calls to reform the way peerages are granted have long gone ignored by Conservative party leaders, and almost a quarter of those appointed to the Lords last year were found to be Tory donors, or close associates or former colleagues of Johnson.\nProposed solution: There are calls to scrap the unelected House of Lords altogether, or for the commission that scrutinises appointments to parliament\u2019s upper chamber to get stronger powers to say no to recommendations by political party leaders.\nMinisters and senior Conservative figures have deleted or lost WhatsApps texts, or turned on \u201cdisappearing messages\u201d so that conversation history disappears after a short period of time. The latest figure to admit some messages have gone missing is Bethell, who is a hereditary peer and advised Hancock on his Tory leadership campaign in 2019. After legal proceedings were launched against the awarding of Covid contracts worth \u00a385m to Abingdon Health, Bethell admitted he had \u201ccleared WhatsApp messages\u201d from his personal phone to \u201cfree up storage\u201d, and conceded: \u201cTo the extent that these messages related to the Abingdon Health contract, they would have been deleted.\u201d\nProposed solution: Campaigners are already launching a judicial review into the government\u2019s use of self-destruct messages.\nThe Guardian revealed on Sunday that a watchdog had to prevent ministers breaching a strict code on political neutrality and independence during the search for new chairs for several semi-public bodies. Messages from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments showed that ministers were asked to replace interview panellists for the high-profile jobs because they were \u201cnot sufficiently independent\u201d. The body said the moves were \u201cthreatening to undermine the independent status\u201d of a role intended to bring \u201cchallenge and rigour\u201d.\nProposed solution: Jonathan Evans, chair of the committee on standards in public life, cited concerns about ministers \u201cseeking to pack assessment panels with majorities of political affiliates\u201d and called for the commissioner for public appointments to be consulted on all panellist choices.",

        "content": "Deal may be reviewed under National Security and Investment Act because nature of business\nThe British satellite communications company Inmarsat has agreed a $7.3bn (\u00a35.4bn) takeover by the California-based Viasat, becoming the latest UK tech firm to be taken over by a foreign rival.\nThe deal is the latest in which a UK company that plays a key role in Britain\u2019s economy and national security is to be taken over by foreign rivals or private equity firms. Inmarsat was listed on the London Stock Exchange before being taken private two years ago by a consortium including the private equity firm Apax.\nViasat, which described the deal as \u201ctransformative\u201d for the global communications industry, said it intended to work with the government to continue to invest and grow Inmarsat\u2019s presence in the UK.\n\u201cViasat plans to preserve and grow Inmarsat\u2019s London headquarters,\u201d the US company said, announcing the deal. \u201cViasat plans to build on Inmarsat\u2019s presence in the UK and is committed to preserving and growing the investment of the combined company in UK space communications.\u201d\nInmarsat provides mobile satellite services that underpin email, internet and video conferencing, as well as in-flight wifi. It has 14 satellites in orbit and plans to launch another seven, and supplied satellite services to the Ministry of Defence to improve ground communications for troops fighting in Afghanistan. It provides commutations services for ships as well.\nThe company, whose technology was used in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in 2014, employs about 860 people at its base in Old Street and 1,800 worldwide.\nViasat, which in 2019 had Priti Patel on a \u00a31,000-an-hour contract for five hours\u2019 work a month as a strategic adviser until she was appointed home secretary, said that it would \u201ccooperatively engage\u201d with the UK government to continue to operate in the country following the same commitments made by the private equity consortium that took over Inmarsat two years ago.\n\u201cTogether, we can advance broadband communications and create new hybrid space and terrestrial networks that drive greater performance, coverage, speed, reliability and value for customers,\u201d said Mark Dankberg, Viasat\u2019s executive chair.\nGiven the nature of Inmarsat\u2019s business the deal may be reviewed under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, legislation brought in to protect key national assets from foreign takeover.\nThe government said it would continue to \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the deal, which will be subject to regulatory scrutiny in a number of markets including the UK.\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe business secretary has powers under the Enterprise Act 2002 to intervene in acquisitions which raise public interest concerns. The government recently strengthened those powers through the National Security and Investment Act, which commences on 4 January 2022.\u201d\nIn July, the government launched a review of the takeover of the Welsh microchip manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia, the Chinese-owned company that acquired the UK\u2019s largest producer of semiconductors.\nIn April, the government ordered an investigation into Nvidia\u2019s takeover of the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, citing potential national security concerns. Four months later, the Competition and Markets Authority launched an in-depth investigation into the deal after finding it raised serious competition concerns.\n\u201cJoining with Viasat is the right combination for Inmarsat at the right time,\u201d said Rajeev Suri, the chief executive of Inmarsat. \u201cThe industrial logic is compelling and ensures that the UK has a strong and sustainable presence in the critical space sector for the long term.\u201d\nViasat, which has a UK base at Farnborough and supplies services and products to the MoD, said it expected the combined company to be able to make cost savings of $190m a year but did not comment on potential job cuts.\n\u201cDecisions regarding management of the combined company following the closing of the transaction will be made as part of the integration planning process,\u201d it said.\nInmarsat was set up in 1979 by the International Maritime Organization, the UN\u2019s maritime body, as an international governmental organisation to enable ships to communicate with shore and to call for help in emergencies. It was privatised in 1999 and floated on the LSE in 2005.\nThe company has struggled in recent years, however, and faces increasing competition from rivals including Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. In July 2020 the government bought a \u00a3400m stake in the satellite operator OneWeb in a post-Brexit effort to rival the European Union\u2019s Galileo system.",

        "content": "Analysis: while identity of hackers is not known in this case, Palestinians have long been spied on by Israeli military\nThe disclosure that Palestinian human rights defenders were reportedly hacked using NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware will come as little surprise to two groups of people: Palestinians themselves and the Israeli military and intelligence cyber operatives who have long spied on Palestinians.\nWhile it is not known who was responsible for the hacking in this instance, what is very well documented is the role of the Israeli military\u2019s 8200 cyberwarfare unit \u2013 known in Hebrew as the Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim \u2013 in the widespread spying on Palestinian society.\nIn 2014, a number of military \u201crefusenik\u201d from the unit described to the Guardian and a handful of other media organisations the scope of the surveillance. The largest intelligence body in the Israeli military, Unit 8200 intercepted electronic communications including email, phone calls and social media in addition to targeting military and diplomatic traffic, they said.\nThose whistleblowers alleged that the \u201call-encompassing\u201d intelligence the unit gathered \u2013 much of it concerning innocent people \u2013 was used to divide Palestinian society. In a letter refusing to continue with interceptions, which they said were unjustified, the reservists described the unit\u2019s work.\n\u201cThe Palestinian population under military rule,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis completely exposed to espionage and surveillance by Israeli intelligence. It is used for political persecution and to create divisions within Palestinian society by recruiting collaborators and driving parts of Palestinian society against itself. In many cases, intelligence prevents defendants from receiving a fair trial in military courts, as the evidence against them is not revealed.\u201d\nThe reservists said personnel were instructed to keep any damaging details of Palestinians\u2019 lives they came across, including information on sexual preferences, infidelities, financial problems or family illnesses that could be \u201cused to extort/blackmail the person and turn them into a collaborator\u201d.\nMore serious still, some former members of the unit claimed that some intelligence gathered was not collected in the service of the Israeli state but in pursuit of the \u201cagendas\u201d of individual Israeli politicians.\nAt the time, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) cast doubt on the claims and said it had \u201cno record that the specific violations in the letter ever took place\u201d.\nAgain, while too little is known about the case of the Palestinian human rights defenders to determine with certainty precisely who was behind the hacking, some issues are clear.\nThe organisations in question \u2013 including Al-Haq, Addameer, Defense for Children International \u2013 Palestine, the Bisan Center for Research and Development, the Union of Palestinian Women\u2019s Committees, and the Union of Agricultural Work Committees \u2013 had been targeted by the Israeli government for intelligence gathering over their work and associations, which saw them recently accused by Israel of \u201cterrorist\u201d associations, which are denied by the groups.\nOn Monday an Israeli security-diplomatic source, briefing journalists, confirmed that investigations into the groups involved had yielded an \u201cexcellent file\u201d of evidence linking the organisations to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist group labelled a terrorist organisation by many western states.\nThe Israeli government, as both NSO and Israeli officials have insisted, licenses the sale and use of NSO spyware. It is currently investigating claims of whether government clients misused the spyware.\nAll of which suggests that the Israeli government should, at the very least, be abundantly aware of who was using the software, and for what purpose, not least since it was used to target organisations and individuals who appear to be primarily of interest to the Israeli state.\nAnd the context of Israeli spying on Palestinians, as reports in the Washington Post and Israeli outlets make clear, is one of routine intrusion that is escalating both in its scale and technical sophistication.\nAccording to the reports, in the past two years, Israel has rolled out a new surveillance initiative that involves a smartphone technology called Blue Wolf that captures photos of Palestinians\u2019 faces and matches them to a database of images so extensive that one former soldier described it as the army\u2019s secret \u201cFacebook for Palestinians\u201d with the phone app flashing to alert soldiers if a person is to be detained, arrested or left alone.\nAll of which raises profound human rights questions over an apparently unchecked state surveillance regime in an area under military occupation. and whose tools and methods, if history is anything to go by, risk being offered as services to other states.",

The Liberal state government argues the legislation will deliver an additional $8.5m a year in state revenue for essential services and community needs, at the expense of Federal Group.\nBut critics say the Gaming Control Amendment bill is a missed opportunity for reform in a state where gaming interests have long held sway and which has one of the highest levels of gambling harm. Tasmanians as a whole lose an average of $15.5m every month to poker machines.\n\u201cThis opportunity in Tasmania is unique,\u201d Meg Webb, an independent upper house MP, says. \u201cWe should be grasping with both hands this opportunity to do everything we can to regulate this industry effectively.\u201d\n\u201cNo other state in Australia has this chance, and we\u2019re utterly blowing it.\u201d\nFor decades, the political deals between Federal Group and the Tasmanian government were shrouded in secrecy. But when details of the controversial arrangement were exposed in 2015, the government committed to put the licences to tender.\nA joint parliamentary committee was set up to investigate. At the 11th hour, the Tasmanian Hotels Association (THA), which represents the state\u2019s pubs and clubs, and Federal Group put forward a joint submission proposing, among other things, a model that raised the tax on pub pokies but slashed them drastically on casino pokies \u2013 by far the most lucrative \u2013 from 25.88% of gross profit to 10%.\nThe proposal was slammed by independent assessors and by the Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission, which argued that it would not provide greater protection for vulnerable people from pokies use or increase regulatory compliance.\nIn an extraordinary pivot, the government abandoned its policy and adopted the industry\u2019s position wholesale \u2013 taking it to the 2018 state election, but staying mum on one crucial detail: the value of the casino tax cut. When Labor took an anti-gambling policy to the same election, the national gaming industry converged on it in a startling display of power \u2013 directly bankrolling the Liberal Party\u2019s campaign and funding its own separate advertising blitz.\nLabor lost, and dumped their anti-pokies policy. When the 2021 election rolled around neither of the major parties wanted to talk about pokies \u2013 especially not the intended casino tax rate. Then a memorandum of understanding between the Labor Party and the THA was leaked, signed prior to this year\u2019s election, showing that Labor had effectively capitulated to the industry, giving the THA the power of veto over its pokies policies. A Right to Information request from Webb also uncovered evidence that the casino tax rate had been agreed upon between the government and Federal Group well before the 2021 election, but kept secret until after it. The figure was 10.19%: the industry got exactly what it wanted.\nThat tax cut represents $119m in lost revenue over the 20-year life of the proposed licence. Were casino pokies to be taxed at the same rate as pubs, the state could yield $248m in public revenue. And revenue is needed: Tasmania is falling behind in a number of socioeconomic measures. Social housing waitlists are longer than they have ever been.\nTasmanian historian James Boyce, who has spent years investigating the links between the gaming lobby and the government, says the problem is a failure of democracy.\n\u201cThe situation in Tasmania exposes the fact that the depletion of our public services is directly connected with the vulnerability of our democracy and breakdown of the democratic process,\u201d Boyce says.\nAnti-pokies campaigners say that 40% of losses from poker machines come from high-risk gamblers. The easiest measure of an effective harm minimisation effort, then, is reduced revenue. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all pokies revenue is jeopardised: measures proven to reduce the harm on gambling addicts \u2013 such as $1 bet maximums and doubling of machine spin speeds from 3 to 6 seconds (thereby halving the speed at which a punter can make a new bet) \u2013 are also shown to have no effect on revenue from recreational gamblers. None of these measures form part of the proposed legislation.\nThe bill finally passed through the lower house of Tasmanian parliament in late October. Labor MP Dean Winter said the party supported it because it ended Federal Group\u2019s monopoly and was an improvement on the status quo. \u201cBy voting with the bill we vote for a piece of legislation that we wouldn\u2019t have proposed, but something that we fundamentally believe is better than the current arrangements,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nThe Greens and a lower-house independent, Kristie Johnston, disagreed. Dozens of amendments were proposed and voted down.\nAll signs point to the government\u2019s intention to ram the bill through the upper house this week. Critics say the best outcome now would be an upper house inquiry allowing controversial elements of the bill to be scrutinised, but this would require support from Labor.\n\u201cWhen the government\u2019s policy has been literally written by industry, you would look to the opposition to be true representatives of their community, but the Labor opposition has also been captured by this industry and compromised,\u201d Webb says.\n\u201cThe issue is actually not just poker machines, it\u2019s about our democracy. Low-income people in Tasmania pay the price of this failure of democracy. This is easily preventable suffering,\u201d says Boyce. \u201cThis is a major taxation measure and it\u2019s locking in enormous levels of social harm.\u201d",

It has also sparked fears about nuclear proliferation, a capability gap, and job losses. It is not clear yet what sort of industry Australia will need in order to support the build and maintenance of nuclear-powered boats.\nUnions wrote to prime minister Scott Morrison in September saying thousands of jobs were at risk.\nDefence officials told senate estimates in October that the future of up to 600 construction jobs was uncertain after the government scrapped the existing project. Another 560 people are employed directly on the existing project.\nMany companies had invested in resources to become part of the supply chain for the submarines that were being bought from France\u2019s Naval Group.\nIn a pre-recorded message Price said she understood the uncertainty the decision had created. She said small and medium businesses affected would be supported to compete for future work across defence programs, and that individual workers would find new jobs through a sovereign shipbuilding talent pool.\nWorkers will be redeployed to other projects, such as maintenance of and upgrades to the Collins-class submarines, or placed with overseas shipbuilders or governments. Others will have the opportunity to get new skills, or train in nuclear power.\n\u201cWe have a solid commitment to find a role within that pool for each and every skilled shipbuilding worker affected by this announcement,\u201d Price said.\n\u201cWe will be building nuclear-powered submarines in South Australia.\u201d\nThe federal government has insisted France knew its project was in trouble, but France, outraged, says it was taken by surprise.\nThe diplomatic stoush with France flared up again last week when Australian reporters interviewed Macron at the G20 summit in Rome. Asked if he thought Morrison had lied to him, Macron said: \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIn response, someone leaked a text from Macron to Morrison from two days before the Aukus announcement asking whether there was good news or bad news on the way.\nFrench ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault, who was recalled to France amid the dispute but has since returned to Canberra, called that leak a \u201cnew low\u201d that threatened trust in the Australian government.\nIn a blistering address to the National Press Club, Thebault said the decision itself was a \u201cstab in the back\u201d. A thousand jobs have been \u201ctrashed\u201d, he said.\nLabor is generally supportive of the Aukus deal but critical of the treatment of France, the potential need for the Collins-class submarines to be used for decades more before new submarines are in the water, and wants a guarantee that no jobs will be lost.\nThe Submarine Institute of Australia is holding its conference on \u201chomegrown undersea technology\u201d until Thursday.\nThe SA premier, Steven Marshall, will tell conference attenders that the state government will help the industry grab available opportunities and \u201chelp towards a seamless transition of skilled workers into new jobs\u201d.",

        "content": "In sports notable for globe-trotting, Australia\u2019s entry requirements make for a significant competitive liability\nFor three decades, Kelly Slater has dominated Australian waves. He first rung the iconic Bell\u2019s Beach bell in 1994, and then again in 2006, 2008 and 2010. On six occasions he has triumphed in competition on the Gold Coast. On his way to winning a record 11 world titles, famous breaks across Australia have often provided an early season launch pad for the American star.\nPerhaps never again. The World Surf League has recently warned surfers that remaining unvaccinated ahead of the 2022 season would pose \u201csignificant challenges\u201d and may see them prohibited from \u201centering certain countries if they are not fully vaccinated\u201d. At the top of that list is Australia, where the WSL is expected to head in April for events at Bells Beach in Victoria and the Margaret River in Western Australia. While the nation\u2019s entry conditions for non-residents have yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated \u2013 as with the Australian Open \u2013 that unvaccinated athletes will either be banned or face strict quarantine requirements.\nSlater, a tour veteran who will soon turn 50, is understood to be unvaccinated against Covid-19. He caused controversy in a recent comment on Instagram, criticising the pro-vaccination advocacy of Australian Ironman athlete Matt Poole. \u201cIf something happens to me, it\u2019s on me, not someone else,\u201d Slater wrote. \u201cAnd for people saying listen to the doctors, I\u2019m positive I know more about being healthy than 99% of doctors.\u201d The surfer has no medical qualifications.\nUnless Slater\u2019s views on vaccination change (he has insisted he is not against vaccinations, just that he does not currently feel comfortable being vaccinated against Covid-19), or authorities loosen restrictions, it seems that the best surfer of all time may never again compete at Australian beaches. Nor is he the only one. Brazil\u2019s Gabriel Medina, who won the 2020/21 WSL season, thanks to wins in Australia at Rottnest Island and Narrabeen, admitted last year that he had refused a vaccination ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. His current status is unclear \u2013 he later insisted his failure to be vaccinated was a \u201cmistake\u201d, adding \u201cvaccine saves lives, guys!\u201d\nSlater\u2019s predicament underscores a looming dilemma for international sporting competitions. While Australia\u2019s long-closed borders are now slowly reopening, the blanket ban on foreign arrivals is being replaced by vaccination requirements that are stringent by international standards. In sports notable for their globe-trotting \u2013 including tennis, golf, road cycling, Formula One, surfing and cricket \u2013 Australia\u2019s entry requirements make being unvaccinated a significant competitive liability. Across a season of fine margins, sitting out one of the four Grand Slams, a Grand Prix or two WSL legs is unthinkable. Or is it?\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an unvaccinated tennis player is going to get a visa to come into this country,\u201d Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews insisted recently, amid defending Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic\u2019s ongoing disinclination to disclose whether or not he has been vaccinated. \u201cAnd if they did get a visa, they\u2019d probably have to quarantine for a couple of weeks. But let\u2019s not personalise it. I don\u2019t think any other [unvaccinated] tennis player or golfer or Formula One driver will even get a visa to get here.\u201d Djokovic has told the New York Times that he is not against vaccines generally, but does not agree with mandates \u2013 especially for the Covid-19 vaccine.\nIn comparison, anyone is able to enter the United Kingdom without a vaccination \u2013 but must self-isolate at home for 10 days and test negative twice. In the past, the British government relaxed entry rules for Premier League stars competing abroad during the international break. In the United States, non-nationals must be vaccinated but there is no blanket quarantine rule for unvaccinated returning citizens. Singapore has also adopted a vaccinated-only approach. While Australia may be at the stricter end of the spectrum, it is by no means the only nation insisting on the vaccine.\nGlobally, sports have been grappling with how to ensure widespread vaccination among athletes and staff. The AFL has been at the forefront, implementing a vaccination mandate that requires all players and football department staff at AFL and AFLW to be vaccinated in order to train and play. The NRL has insisted it will not take the same approach, although admitted that state health rules and airline requirements may take the matter off their hands. In the NBL, 99% of players have had at least one dose ahead of the season tip-off next month; in reaching that high-level of coverage, a number of players who refused to get the jab have been released from their contracts.\nThose numbers compare favourably to overseas leagues \u2013 only about 70% of Premier League stars are double-jabbed, while rates in major American leagues hover at just above 90% \u2013 largely without the use of league-enforced mandates. But there have been high-profile hold-outs \u2013 Kyrie Irving has not played a minute this season for the Brooklyn Nets, after refusing the vaccine in the face of a New York City requirement for anyone entering indoor gyms, including the Nets\u2019 stadium, to be vaccinated. While Irving remains benched, he is being paid only half of his $45m annual salary.\nWhile interest in high-profile domestic athletes who have refused vaccination  may diminish once leagues return to action, international competitions look set to face an ongoing headache. With major global events on the agenda, including the UCI Road World Championships and Fiba Women\u2019s Basketball World Cup next September, the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup in 2023, and the anticipated return of F1 at Albert Park and the Tour Down Under in South Australia, being vaccinated is likely to be an effectively essential requirement for jet-setting sports stars.\nFor as long as the likes of Slater and Irving resist the vaccine, their fame and sporting prowess will mean that leagues and governing bodies grapple with meeting local requirements while attempting to accommodate the hold-outs. Yet with state premiers holding firm, a compromise in Australia seems unlikely. Slater\u2019s rivals on the WSL will breathe easy knowing they have one less foe in the water at Bells Beach next Easter.",

Sign up now!\nConsidering his team had lost five consecutive matches by an aggregate score of 13-5, The Fiver is surprised by just how surprised it was upon hearing Dean Smith had got the old tin-tack from Aston Villa. Death, taxes and football managers who are not called Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r being cut loose at the first sign of a crisis are three of life\u2019s certainties after all. As the fifth richest owners in the Premier League, Villa\u2019s billionaire proprietors have made no secret of their plans for world domination \u2026 or at least qualification for Big Vase in the next couple of seasons.\nHaving hosed money at the transfer market before and after staying up by the skin of their teeth the season before last, they expected more bang for their buck than back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back defeats against Spurs, Wolves, Arsenal, West Ham and Southampton. For all that, reaction to Smith getting the gate has been largely sympathetic, in a way one suspects it might not have been if he wasn\u2019t such a demonstrably nice bloke who is Villa to his bones.\n\u201cAfter a good start to last season, this year we have not seen the continuous improvement in results, performances and league position which we have all been looking for,\u201d droned a statement from the club hierarchy. \u201cFor this reason we have decided to make a change now to allow time for a new head coach to make an impact.\u201d Translation: \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay a club record transfer fee for Emi Buend\u00eda to see him played out of position week in and week out, just so we can field two expensive strikers who keep getting in each other\u2019s way. Now, do one!\u201d\nGuaranteed the goodwill and gratitude of his fellow Villa fans, a multi-million pound golden boot up the jacksy and another job at a half-decent club whenever he wants one, Smith may well be relieved at being handed his P45 at a time before the atmosphere at Villa Park turned poisonous. \u201cI respect the owners\u2019 decision, but I felt that with important players soon returning to full fitness we would achieve a top half finish,\u201d Smith said on Monday. \u201cThe board\u2019s aims are to take our club back into European football and I would love nothing more than seeing the club achieve that.\u201d\nMeanwhile at Carrow Road, a ground where the toxicity dial doesn\u2019t seem to go much higher than five, Daniel Farke was also relieved of his duties on the back of one consecutive victory, his team\u2019s first in the top flight this season. \u201cTo be questioning Daniel at this point would be incredibly unfair,\u201d said Norwich sporting director Stuart Webber a little over a week ago. \u201cWe\u2019re fully committed to Daniel. That\u2019s why we gave him a four-year contract in the summer. The work he\u2019s done at this club has been beyond incredible.\u201d\nNo doubt galvanised by the club hierarchy\u2019s show of faith in his abilities, Farke rallied his troops to a stirring win over Brentford only to be shown the door. \u201cDaniel and his staff will always be welcome back here,\u201d said Webber in a club statement announcing he\u2019d performed the kind of U-turn even a Tory front-bencher would find audacious. The Fiver looks forward to seeing Farke and his backroom team take this open invitation literally, by taking their seats among the fans behind the home dugout for Norwich\u2019s game against Southampton after the international break.\n\u201cNeed a barber in Perth on Thursday.

        "content": "Sajid Javid reveals police have so far confirmed Fuller abused 100 corpses in Kent hospitals over 12 years\nMinisters have bowed to pressure to hold an independent inquiry into how hospital worker David Fuller serially abused female corpses in mortuaries for over 12 years.\nAnnouncing the review, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: \u201cWe have a responsibility to everyone affected by these shocking crimes to do right by those we\u2019ve lost, and those still left behind in their shock and their grief.\u201d\nHe revealed police had so far confirmed that Fuller abused 100 corpses in Kent hospitals between 2008 and 2020, including 81 who had so far been identified. Javid apologised to the families and friends of the victims and set out tighter security arrangements for mortuaries.\nHe said: \u201cEven as we look into exactly what happened, as the secretary of state for health and social care, I want to apologise to the friends and families of all the victims for the crimes that were perpetrated in the care of the NHS and for the hurt and suffering they are feeling.\u201d\nTougher security in mortuaries will include hospitals ensuring they have CCTV in place and controlled access arrangements. Javid also announced a review of the punishments for abusing corpses.\nHe said: \u201cThe justice secretary will be looking at whether the penalties that are currently available for such appalling sexual offences are appropriate.\u201d\nThe scale of Fuller\u2019s offences began to emerge last week after he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and murdering Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce in Tunbridge Wells in 1987.\nAhead of his trial, he had pleaded guilty to 51 mortuary offences in two hospitals where he worked as an electrician. They were Kent and Sussex hospital and its replacement, Tunbridge Wells hospital. Kent police confirmed that there had been 403 calls by Monday morning to a phone line set up for people with information about the investigation.\nFuller\u2019s abuse of corpses prompted the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust to commission an independent investigation.\nLast Friday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson refused to commit to a full inquiry and said they would wait for the NHS trust inquiry to conclude. The government changed tack after local MPs including the former minister Greg Clark, Kent\u2019s police commissioner, Matthew Scott, and families of the victims backed calls for an independent investigation.\nJavid said: \u201cGiven the scale and the nature of these sexual offences, I believe that we must go further. And so today I can announce that I am replacing the trust investigation with an independent inquiry.\n\u201cThe inquiry will look into the circumstances surrounding the offences committed at the hospital and then national implications. It will help us understand how these offences took place without detection in the trust; identify any areas where early action by this trust was necessary; and then consider wider national issues, including for the NHS.\u201d\nThe inquiry will be chaired by Sir Jonathan Michael, a former hospital chief executive, who had been chairing the trust\u2019s inquiry. Michael has been asked to report its interim findings in the new year. Javid said a second, final report would look at the broader national picture and the wider lessons for the NHS and for other settings.\nLabour welcomed the review. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, called for the families affected to be able to access to all the psychological counselling and support they need.\nAshworth offered cross-party cooperation on the inquiry. He said: \u201cWhen our loved ones are admitted into the hands of medical care, it\u2019s done so on the basis of a bond of trust that our loved ones will be cared for when sick and will be accorded dignity in death. That bond of trust was callously ripped apart here. So can I offer to work with the secretary of state to ensure something so sickening as this never happens again.\u201d\nClark, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, praised Javid for responding to his call for a public inquiry. He said: \u201cIt does go beyond the local. In the last four years, there have been over 30 incidents of unauthorised people entering mortuaries in NHS hospitals.\u201d\nThe inquiry was also welcomed by Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which is supporting Nevres Kemal, whose daughter Azra, 24, died in July 2020 and whose body was repeatedly raped by Fuller in Tunbridge Wells mortuary.\nIn a statement it said: \u201cWe also welcome the proposed review of sentencing for necrophilia.\nWe applaud the courage of Nevres Kemal who spoke out after she was provided with the horrific news of her daughter, Azra\u2019s bodily violation. We hope that the families of the identified victims will be given adequate opportunity to input into the inquiry announced and receive any answers they are looking for.\u201d",

And it should be, it should be. But this should be too.\u201d\nAmong campaigners against gun violence and for gun control reform, the term \u201cmass shooting\u201d is generally held to refer to any incident in which four people, excluding the shooter, are killed. Debate continues into whether such a definition is helpful.\nIn 2019, Marisa Booty, a research analyst for the Center for Gun Policy and Research and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, told the Guardian: \u201cWe hear about high-profile mass shootings that are happening at schools and in churches but a lot of violence in neighborhoods isn\u2019t being as heavily weighted.\n\u201cRegardless of the circumstances of the incident, multiple people are being shot and potentially killed, and people are suffering lifelong consequences.\u201d\nThe shooting in Norfolk in which three women were killed and two injured was being treated as a suspected domestic violence incident.\nA 19-year-old man shot and injured a 19-year-old woman, an eye witness said. When the woman\u2019s mother and a friend came to help, the man shot and killed them both. Another neighbor was killed while another person who responded to the shooting was injured.\n\u201cNothing they could do,\u201d a neighbor who witnessed the shooting but who asked to stay anonymous told WAVY, a local NBC affiliate. \u201cThey were shot execution-style. They had just come home from work.\u201d\nThe three women who were killed were identified as Detra R Brown, 42; Nicole Lovewine, 45; and Sara E Costine, 44.\nZiontay Brian Ricardo Palmer was charged with three counts of second-degree murder, one count of malicious wounding and four counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He was held with no bond.\nOn Thursday, Boone spoke near the scene of the shooting. Referring to children who witnessed it, he said: \u201cIt breaks my heart to look at those young kids \u2026 trying to process what they\u2019re looking at. I\u2019m a grown man with 30 years of police experience and it shook me to my core. I can only imagine what it did to those kids.\u201d\nAddressing dozens of people, Boone asked: \u201cHow long are we going to be performative and say pretty words? Where\u2019s the action?\u201d",

        "content": "Sir Michael Rutter, who has died aged 88, was often described as the father of modern child psychiatry. Through incorporating rigorous scientific methods, he revolutionised his field, and laid the foundations for current understanding of normal and abnormal child developmental psychology.\nIn the early 1960s, child psychiatry was a comparatively new discipline, heavily dependent on clinical opinion and strongly influenced by psychoanalytic theory. Michael, in his role as the first chair of child psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, from 1973, played a huge role in changing all of that.\nUsing objective research methods from areas such as epidemiology, developmental psychology and genetics, Michael led breakthroughs in such areas as our understanding of autism and in challenging the long-held belief, from theories first proposed in the late 40s by the psychoanalyst John Bowlby, that lack of a secure early attachment to a mother would almost inevitably result in later psychological impairment. In fact, Michael pointed out, maternal deprivation was best viewed as a vulnerability factor rather than a causative one for later psychological problems.\nSuch discoveries came from Michael\u2019s talent for spotting opportunities for \u201cnatural experiments\u201d, that is, studies of children exposed to differing conditions. One such natural experiment, published in 1977, looked at twins. Identical twins share all of their genes, whereas non-identical twins share only half. With Susan Folstein, a visiting fellow from Johns Hopkins University, Michael performed a study showing that there was increased prevalence of autism in the identical co-twins of children diagnosed with autism but not in non-identical co-twins. The paper, in the journal Nature, caused a controversy. The implication that autism has a strong genetic component was criticised not just by family theorists, who held that autism resulted from an emotionally cool upbringing by \u201crefrigerator parents\u201d, but also by some geneticists on methodological grounds. Nevertheless, the findings were subsequently upheld by other family and twin studies as well as by much more recent molecular genetic studies, and it is now accepted that autism is a highly heritable condition, the causes of which are beginning to be understood at a genomic level.\nAnother set of natural experiments was epidemiological studies from the 60s onwards of the wellbeing and educational attainment of primary school children raised in contrasting urban and rural environments \u2013 the inner south London borough of Camberwell and the Isle of Wight. Among the many findings were that behavioural deviance, psychiatric disorder and specific reading retardation were all twice as common in London as in those living on the Isle of Wight.\nHowever, once measures of family disadvantage were taken into account, these differences largely disappeared. The studies also showed that wellbeing and attainment differed hugely between schools, with the implication that schooling quality helps shape child development. A book based on a collaboration between researchers and teachers of secondary-aged children in inner London, Fifteen Thousand Hours (1979), reached similar conclusions.\nFollowing the collapse of Romania\u2019s communist regime in the early 90s, one of the striking media stories was of the horrifying conditions endured by children incarcerated in its orphanages. Such coverage resulted in many Romanian orphans being adopted by families in the UK. Michael followed them up and found encouraging outcomes. Despite early severe deprivation, the majority of children achieved marked physical and psychological improvements following their transfer into more caring and nurturing environments.\nSuch good outcomes contradicted Bowlby\u2019s established theories. Michael had earlier written a book-long critique of Bowlby, Maternal Deprivation Reassessed (1972), in which he argued that Bowlby\u2019s theories were at best only partially correct and even then not always for the correct reasons. Now, in the Romanian adoptee study results, here was tangible evidence that even the effects of the most extreme varieties of early deprivation could be ameliorated by caring parenting.\nThe oldest son of Winifred (nee Barber) and Llewellyn Rutter, Michael was born in Lebanon, where his father was working as a doctor. The family moved back to the UK soon after, where Llewellyn became a GP, like his father before him. The family were Quakers and, after a period of evacuation to the US during the second world war, Michael was educated at Wolverhampton grammar school and, as a boarder, at Bootham school, a Quaker school in York.\nAfter graduating from Birmingham University medical school in 1956, Michael trained in neurology and paediatrics before moving to the Maudsley hospital and the Institute of Psychiatry, London, to complete his clinical training. His career rise there was rapid. In 1984 he was appointed to the directorship of the Medical Research Council (MRC) child psychiatry unit based at the institute. The unit soon became world renowned for its leadership in advancing child psychiatry research.\nIn 1994 the Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre was set up, as a partnership between the Institute and the MRC, with Michael as director. The SGDP Centre was the joint brainchild of Michael, David Goldberg, the head of the institute\u2019s psychiatry department, and George Radda, the CEO of the MRC. All three wanted to further the study of environmental factors in psychiatry alongside the rapid recent advances in genetic and developmental research. The SGDP became a model for other multidisciplinary MRC-university centre partnerships throughout the UK.\nMichael married Marjorie Heys, a nurse, in 1958. They had three children, after which Marjorie returned to work as a clinical nurse specialist. She and Michael co-authored Developing Minds (1993), a well-received book for the general reader.\nMichael received many awards, including a knighthood in 1992. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1984, at that time the only psychiatrist to be so honoured, and was a founding fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences.\nHe stepped down as director of the MRC SGDP Centre in 1998. I succeeded him, but most mornings thereafter he was in the building well ahead of me and he only fully retired this year. In the edition of the BBC Radio 4 programme The Life Scientific that featured Michael in his 82nd year, he described his days as working \u201cpart-time\u201d from \u201cabout 8.30 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon\u201d.\nHe is survived by Marjorie, their children, Sheila, Stephen and Christine, and seven grandchildren.\n Michael Rutter, child psychiatrist, born 15 August 1933; died 23 October 2021",

        "content": "Anticipation and celebration are in the air as passengers look forward to reunions, holidays and business\nNearly 20 months after the US introduced a travel ban, British travellers were allowed into the country on Monday.\nThe UK was one of more than 30 countries, including Mexico and Canada, that saw an easing of the travel restrictions that have kept families apart for nearly two years.\nAt Heathrow airport, the first British Airways and Virgin Atlantic transatlantic flights since March 2020 departed simultaneously from parallel runways, destined for New York JFK airport.\nOnboard BA flight 001, there was a sense of anticipation among passengers who were looking forward to being reunited with family and friends, heading on holiday, or taking a business trip.\nBhavna Patel, 59, from south Croydon, accompanied by her daughter Bindiya, 31, was travelling to see her grandson, who was born more than a year ago. The first member of the next generation in her family, she has seen him online but never in person.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hold him,\u201d she said onboard the flight. Her son had married an American and eventually settled in Manhattan: \u201cUsually they spend every Christmas with us, but we last saw them in 2019.\u201d\nSince then, her grandson, Kai, had come along in October 2020.\n\u201cWhen my brother found out they had opened up to airlines, he was like: you\u2019re coming,\u201d said Bindiya. Since then, they had answered a callout on social media by BA to help reunite families, and been given tickets for the first flight, ready to be reunited at JFK airport.\nJemmi Fajer, 22, an easyJet flight attendant from Lyon, had planned trips to visit friends in New York City three times during the pandemic in the hope that the rules would change, but had to cancel each time. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be finally going \u2013 just to see old friends, stroll around,\u201d she said.\nJean Berrigan, 72, a retired nurse from Suffolk, described herself as a solo traveller \u2013 frustrated during the pandemic \u2013 and was heading out for a four-night stay in the US, where she used to work. \u201cI was watching and thought as soon as it opens up, I\u2019m going. I\u2019m so pleased it\u2019s opened up for everyone, families reuniting.\u201d A ticket for the first flight cost more but, she said: \u201cI just thought I\u2019m going regardless \u2013 I booked the first flight I could.\u201d\nWhile some on the plane were celebrating, it was far from a complete return to normality. Rules have eased but masks onboard are compulsory throughout, apart from at mealtimes, and passengers must still have pre-departure Covid tests and proof of full vaccination. Although BA said corporate travel was returning, few suits or laptops were visible onboard.\nNigel Scorey, 55, was one of the few passengers in the main cabin working on a laptop \u2013 and said he had found himself on the first flight by accident, having secured a rare exemption to travel to the US once already during the pandemic as the director of a small supply-chain business, Procure4, based in Leamington Spa.\nThe US was his only destination for international business travel, he said, as a customer of 30 years with British Airways, but he added: \u201cOne of the challenges for companies like BA is that we have proven to ourselves that we don\u2019t have to do this, with Zoom calls. I certainly won\u2019t travel as much as before.\u201d\nWhile he waited at Heathrow to travel to Las Vegas, Peter Short, 75, alluded to the increased administrative tasks placed on those looking to travel when he said: \u201cIf I\u2019d known how much trouble it was to get to the states, I wouldn\u2019t have booked it. You have to do all of the tests \u2013 and when you come back. I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nArriving at JFK airport in New York to claps and red, white and blue balloons, passengers coming off the first BA plane said the flight had a party atmosphere.\nCharlene Prempeh, arriving in New York for the first time in 18 months, said: \u201cIt feels great to be back \u2013 like returning to a long-lost love.\u201d\nShe added that on the flight, the BA chief executive, Sean Doyle, had addressed passengers on sustainability and the airline\u2019s plans to reach net zero emissions. \u201cIt felt a bit odd, frankly,\u201d Prempeh added, laughing. \u201cEverything seemed a bit weird on this flight, but in the context of the general madness, it felt fine.\u201d\nKatie Mydlarz, waiting outside Terminal 7 after the BA flight, said: \u201cI\u2019m here to see my grandson: this is my first meeting. I\u2019m really excited. It\u2019s been a long time. We\u2019ve FaceTimed but it\u2019s not the same without the cuddles and cooing. I can\u2019t wait to see who he reminds me of.\u201d\nAnother passenger, Mainda Kiwelu, said she had flown over for a conference. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time here and my first flight since Covid so I was a bit apprehensive,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be in America. I\u2019ve missed the freedom and missed travelling in general. I got out of practice. It\u2019s a bit of a logistical exercise to get lined up \u2013 the apps, the paperwork, the different check-in times \u2013 but once that\u2019s all done it\u2019s nice.\u201d\nMeanwhile, back at Heathrow, others were waiting to board later transatlantic flights. Jack Olivarius-McAllister, 27, said he was looking forward to seeing his extended family again, many of whom live in the US. \u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be really nice to catch up with friends as well. I used to go twice a year. Usually once with family then once again to see friends for myself \u2026 [but] I have not been since March 2019.\u201d",

        "content": "Michael Rousseau\u2019s decision not to speak French in Quebec address inflames longstanding grievances over linguistic rights\nThe head of Canada\u2019s largest airline is facing public outrage and calls for his resignation after giving a speech in English to business leaders in Quebec \u2013 a misstep that has inflamed longstanding grievances over linguistic rights and and protections in the lone province where French is the only official language.\nThe row began last week, when in his first major public appearance as head of Air Canada, Michael Rousseau chose to address the city\u2019s chamber of commerce without speaking French.\nRousseau\u2019s gaffe comes as the Quebec government attempts to dramatically strengthen protections for the French language amid fears English is overtaking it, especially in large cities.\nAfter his speech, Rousseau told reporters that despite having lived in Montreal for 14 years, he had not learned Quebec\u2019s official language \u2013 and dodged questions posed to him in French.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to live in Montreal without speaking French, and I think that\u2019s a testament to the city of Montreal,\u201d he said, adding that his schedule did not allow him time to take French courses.\nLocal outlets have reported that the company, which is headquartered in Montreal, was warned in advance by both the province\u2019s premier and the federal language commissioner that an English-only speech could prompt backlash.\nBut despite a quick apology \u2013 and pledge from Rousseau to immediately learn French \u2013 the incident has reignited resentments over language rights.\nFor many, the incident evoked the 1950s, when company bosses would speak only English to their workers \u2013 and often refuse to allow French to be spoken. Those dynamics helped spark the Quiet Revolution \u2013 the bloodless overthrow of Catholicism and the anglophone ruling classes in the province \u2013 and a Quebecers separatist movement.\n\u201cThe big boss of Air Canada expresses everything we rejected decades ago: contempt for our language and our culture at home in Quebec. These words are beneath the job he holds,\u201d tweeted Simon Jolin-Barrette, the province\u2019s minister responsible for the French language.\nOthers expressed disbelief that Rousseau, whose mother and wife both speak French, had somehow avoided picking up a conversational ability after more than a decade in the city.\n\u201cIt is possible, but very, very, very difficult to live in Montreal for 15 years and not be able to understand that question. You really have to be actively trying not to pick up a single thing,\u201d tweeted one citizen.\nJustin Trudeau, the prime minister, called the situation \u201cunacceptable\u201d and various political figures have called for Rousseau to step down.\nOn Monday, Chrystia Freeland wrote to Air Canada\u2019s board, calling the remarks \u201cutterly inconsistent\u201d with the company\u2019s pledge to language diversity after the airline \u2013 which was once operated by the government \u2013 went private.\nIn the letter shared with the Guardian, the deputy prime minister and finance minister noted that the government still owns 6% of the company\u2019s stock, and called for a \u201csignificant\u201d improvement to Rousseau\u2019s French \u2013 and for his language skills to be tied to his annual performance review.\nCanada\u2019s language commissioner usually receives 100 complaints about the airline per year \u2013 but since Wednesday, the office has received more than 1,000 complaints, a spokesperson said.\nThe language row also comes under the shadow of legislation pushed by the provincial government that would significantly strengthen language laws.\nBill 96 would change the country\u2019s constitution to define Quebec as a nation, with its official and common leagues being French. It would also require all provincial communication with immigrants to be in French, starting six months after they arrive in Quebec.\nThe bill would create a French language ministry and give new powers to the French-language watchdog.",

        "content": "Advice that left many leaseholders unable to sell their homes to be retracted by Christmas\nSafety advice that has left thousands of households unable to sell their homes after the Grenfell Tower fire will be withdrawn by Christmas, Michael Gove has announced.\nThe secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities told MPs the government would revoke advice that has stood since January 2020 and has led to hundreds of low-rise buildings being deemed unsafe, meaning mortgage companies refused to lend against them.\nThe advice note introduced by the government called for building owners to check cladding systems on all blocks, regardless of their height. Previously, checks were only needed on buildings over 18 metres tall where the difficulty evacuating from a fire created a risk to life.\nGove told MPs: \u201cThe government has a responsibility to make buildings safe, but we also have a responsibility to relieve some of the obligations faced by leaseholders at the moment who are innocent parties in this and in many circumstances are being asked to pay disproportionate sums when there are individuals in business, some of them still in business, who are guilty men and women.\u201d\nHe also announced that he had \u201cpaused\u201d a planned scheme to lend leaseholders money to pay for repairs found to be necessary after Grenfell, saying he was unhappy with leaseholders footing the bill and that he was seeking a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d approach for covering cladding and other fire safety costs.\nIn evidence to the Commons select committee on levelling up, housing and communities, he also admitted that in the years before the Grenfell Tower fire, the government made mistakes on fire safety.\nIn the coming months, the public inquiry into the disaster will examine the role of government ministers and officials in the coming months. Gove said: \u201cThe deregulation of assessment [of building materials] and the way in which it was done was mistaken, and I also think that the department itself will be seen to have, on a couple of occasions, not necessarily appreciated the importance of fire safety and not necessarily done everything in the wake of the Lakanal House tragedy [a 2009 tower block fire where six people died] that it should have done.\u201d\nHe admitted: \u201cWe collectively, the department, some in local government, others in the private sector, failed people at Grenfell.\u201d But he said he wanted a better assessment of which buildings actually were at high risk of fire and he wanted to \u201cminimise risk in lower-risk buildings without creating a situation where people can\u2019t move and cannot access mortgage finance\u201d.\nCampaigners for leaseholders affected by the building safety crisis, which has left homeowners across England facing bills totalling over \u00a315bn according to some estimates, welcomed the decision to finally change the advice on what constitutes a risky building.\n\u201cWe are hopeful [it] will relieve a lot of the pressure on many of the buildings, but we need to see what replaces it, and the mortgage companies and insurers need to buy into the process,\u201d said Giles Grover, a spokesperson for the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign.\nFlorence Eshalomi, MP for Vauxhall, told Gove her constituents were sharing bills of \u00a35,000 a month for waking watch patrols to check for fires, and Gove said these were \u201cnot the only rip-off in the system\u201d. He drew a parallel between firms that were responsible for causing problems and advisers now saying leaseholders need to pay large sums to make their homes safe.\nHe said that some companies now proposing to fix buildings, sometimes at a cost of over \u00a3100,000 per leaseholder, \u201chave seen an opportunity to make money for themselves\u201d.",

And that night was no different than any other day. It\u2019s keys, phone, wallet, gun.\u201d\nRittenhouse traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, in response to a Kenosha-based militia calling for protection for businesses against protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Then 17, Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-15-style rifle.\nGrosskreutz, who trained as a paramedic, testified that he volunteered as a medic at protests in Milwaukee in the days after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, by a Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on his neck.\nGrosskreutz attended around 75 protests, he said, offering help to anyone needing medical attention, before the night he was shot.\nIn Kenosha, he said, he was wearing a hat that said \u201cparamedic\u201d and was carrying medical supplies as well as a loaded pistol. Grosskreutz said his permit to carry a concealed weapon had expired and he did not have a valid permit that night.\nHe said he provided medical assistance to about 10 people.\nRittenhouse kept his eyes on Grosskreutz as he testified. When asked questions by prosecutors, Grosskreutz turned and looked straight at the jurors, just feet away.\nIn a video played in court, Grosskreutz was shown approaching Rittenhouse in Kenosha as Rittenhouse was running. Grosskreutz asked what Rittenhouse was doing and whether someone was shot. Rittenhouse replied: \u201cI\u2019m going to the police. I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\nGrosskreutz testified that at the time he thought Rittenhouse said: \u201cI\u2019m working with the police.\u201d\nWhen a prosecutor asked Grosskreutz why he did not shoot Rittenhouse, Grosskreutz said: \u201cLike I said, that\u2019s not the kind of person that I am. That\u2019s not why I was out there. It\u2019s not who I am. And definitely not somebody I would want to become.\u201d\nIn the first week of Rittenhouse\u2019s trial, prosecutors played videos that showed the events of the night in question from different angles. Jurors heard testimony from people who were with Rittenhouse, from police officers and from loved ones of the men who died.\nThe highly contentious trial, which is expected to last approximately two weeks, will determine whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense or in an intentional act of vigilantism.\nThe 18-year old is charged with two counts of homicide, one of attempted homicide and two of recklessly endangering safety, for firing his weapon near others. He is also charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor, as he was 17 at the time. Facing a possible life sentence, he has pleaded not guilty.\nThe trial continues.",

Polish helicopters hovered over the scene as some of the migrants chanted, \u201cGermany!\u201d, their desired destination, according to video posted to social media.\nBy evening, hundreds had set up tents and lit campfires in a forested border area, suggesting clashes could repeat themselves in coming days as Polish officials have vowed to prevent people from crossing into the country from Belarus.\nGunshots can be heard in one video posted to social media. It is not clear whether anyone was injured as a result. In the footage, a voice off-camera says that Belarusian border guards had opened fire, possibly in the air. Belarusian officials confirmed that gunshots were audible but claimed they had come from the Polish side of the border. \nPoland and other EU countries have accused Belarus of trying to provoke a new refugee crisis in Europe in revenge for their criticism of Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s brutal crackdown on opposition and European sanctions after the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in May, in effect opening up a new migration route to the bloc.\nOne Iraqi Kurdish woman told the Guardian that she was brought to Belarus by a travel agency that provided them with flights to Minsk and then a transfer to the EU\u2019s external border. People can be charged \u20ac15,000-\u20ac20,000 (\u00a312,800-\u00a317,100) when they reach Belarus.\nThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU should now extend its sanctions on the Belarusian regime. She said: \u201cBelarus must stop putting people\u2019s lives at risk. The instrumentalisation of migrants for political purposes by Belarus is unacceptable.\u201d\nVon der Leyen also pledged greater support for Poland, Lithuania and Latvia to deal with the crisis and said the EU would explore \u201chow to sanction, including through blacklisting, third-country airlines that are active in human trafficking\u201d.\nThe crisis along the European Union\u2019s eastern border has been simmering for months but escalated in the last 24 hours. Poland\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, told Polish public radio on Monday that Belarus was trying to cause a \u201cmajor incident, preferably with shots fired and casualties\u201d, and the defence minister, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, said 12,000 soldiers were \u201cprepared to defend the Polish border\u201d. Piotr Mueller, the Polish government spokesperson, said there were 3,000 to 4,000 people next to the Polish border.\nThose attempting to cross from Belarus into the EU have become trapped between the two since October, when Polish police were authorised to summarily expel migrants and ignore asylum applications. Belarusian border guards have refused to allow them to turn back, meaning that people from countries including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan have been left in the inhospitable forests as temperatures drop below freezing.\nAnton Bychkovsky, a spokesman for Belarus\u2019s border guards, told the Associated Press those at the border were seeking to \u201cexercise their right to apply for refugee status in the EU\u201d. He said they had gathered into such a large group in order to avoid \u201cforcible ousting by the Polish side\u201d.\nCrystal van Leeuwen, a medical emergency manager with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, told the Guardian last week that NGOs must urgently gain access to the secure zone for migrants\u2019 claims and international protection to be respected.\nPoland has reported nearly 30,000 illegal border crossings this year, with more than 17,000 coming in October. Many are attempting to flee to Germany, which said it had received more than 6,100 refugees via Poland from Belarus since the beginning of the year.\nYet those efforts rarely looked so organised as the mass column on Belarus\u2019s M6 highway on Monday, which critics saw as a dramatic attempt by Lukashenko to increase pressure on his neighbour. Tensions soared between the two countries with the sharp rise in border crossings in October.

        "content": "Black Caps all-rounder says they are underdogs in their T20 World Cup semi-final with England \u2013 but insists they can beat anyone\nIt is the morning after New Zealand qualified for the T20 World Cup semi-finals by pipping the pre-tournament favourites, India, to second spot in their Super 12s group, and Mitchell Santner is heading out to play golf. This will surprise nobody who knows him \u2013 after all, he describes himself in his Instagram bio as a part-time cricketer and full-time golfer \u2013 but perhaps his ability to turn off and switch his attention to a different kind of white ball at this of all moments illustrates how comfortable his team have become with major-tournament success.\nThey are making a habit of playing their way into the serious end of the sport\u2019s most important competitions. New Zealand have reached the last four of the last four 50-over World Cups \u2013 and the last two finals \u2013 were 2016 Twenty20 semi-finalists, 2021 World Test champions, and are continuing their run of multiformat form by shining once again in the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cTo win the Test stuff was pretty special, our first major trophy, but obviously we don\u2019t want to stop there,\u201d Santner says. \u201cWith the current setup and the current team, everyone\u2019s got that belief that we can beat anyone on our day \u2013 and we\u2019ve shown that.\n\u201cObviously I think we always go into these tournaments kind of as the underdogs, but we can bank those experiences, keep doing the little things and think about that stuff down the road. We can\u2019t get caught up in that during the tournament, but maybe at some point we\u2019ll think: \u2018Shit, that was a pretty good effort, lads.\u2019 The last few years have been pretty good for us in terms of beating big teams in big events so we just keep doing what we\u2019re doing and not try to change a hell of a lot.\u201d\nAt the last 20-over World Cup, in 2016, Santner had just turned 24 and was new to the New Zealand side: their opening game against India in Nagpur was just his sixth T20 international. He marked it with what remains his finest bowling performance in the format, taking four wickets for just 11 runs with Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni among his victims. The Black Caps went on to lose to England in the last four, and the theme of beating India before losing to England continued at the 50-over World Cup in 2019. They will attempt another repeat when they face Eoin Morgan\u2019s side in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think 2019 will come up much,\u201d he says of the ludicrously dramatic ODI World Cup final at Lord\u2019s. \u201cObviously it was pretty heartbreaking at the time. Everyone played it pretty well, but inside they were probably feeling different, wanting to show some emotion. In terms of the game itself it was pretty special. We were unfortunate to be on the losing side but we hadn\u2019t made a lot of finals before so it was all new.\n\u201cThis is a different challenge, a different format, and we bank those experiences and try to be one better. We\u2019ll do our scouting, put all the plans in place, and then just try to execute that as best we can on the day. If it works, outstanding, and if it doesn\u2019t, it is what it is. I think we can\u2019t look too much into the past. This is a different English side on a different surface.\u201d\nIt is a more different English side than they might have anticipated, with Jofra Archer, Ben Stokes and Jason Roy, who all started that 2019 final, among a string of key players ruled out through injury. \u201cThey\u2019ll still be a very good side and tough to beat, no doubt,\u201d Santner says. \u201cEven without some of those guys they\u2019ve come out flying and played some very good cricket. Tymal Mills and now Roy\u2019s a pretty big blow, but they\u2019ll probably just send Jonny Bairstow to the top and look as strong as ever. I think the balance of the English squad at the moment is massive, they bat all the way down and they\u2019ve got the firepower with the bowlers as well. The wicket looks pretty good, so it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d\nSantner was part of the Chennai Super Kings side that won the Indian Premier League in the UAE just before the World Cup started, though he never actually got a game and New Zealand\u2019s final group match, against Afghanistan, was the first time he had played in Abu Dhabi. His two overs cost 27 runs \u2013 another experience to bank. \u201cI guess you try to leave it behind and move on,\u201d he says. \u201cI think length is very important in Abu Dhabi, with it skidding on and not being a lot of turn, so as a spin unit you have to be on.\u201d\nRight now, however, he is very much off. \u201cGetting away from the game is important,\u201d he says. \u201cThen when it\u2019s time to turn on for the semi-final you can switch on easily. If you\u2019re not up for an ICC world event, well \u2026 I guess this is the pinnacle.\u201d\nIt is one his side have got used to climbing, and they have new peaks in their sights.",

In Brazil a PFF-2 protective mask was found in the stomach of a dead Magellanic penguin.\nThe scientists predicted that by the end of the century almost all pandemic-associated plastics will end up on either the seabed or on beaches.\nThe Chinese study found that 46% of the mismanaged plastic waste came from Asia, due to the high level of mask-wearing by individuals there, followed by Europe, 24%, and North and South America, 22%.\nPeng and Wu said their research suggested 87.4% of the excess waste was from hospitals, rather than from individual use. PPE usage by individuals contributed only 7.6% of the total, while packaging and test kits accounted for 4.7% and 0.3% respectively.\n\u201cMost of the plastic is from medical waste generated by hospitals that dwarfs the contribution from personal protection equipment and online-shopping package material,\u201d they wrote.\n\u201cThis poses a long-lasting problem for the ocean environment and is mainly accumulated on beaches and coastal sediments.\u201d\nThe thousands of tonnes of masks, gloves, testing kits and face visors which leached into the oceans from the start of the pandemic up to August this year, were transported in 369 major rivers.\nChief among these were Shatt al-Arab in south-eastern Iraq, which carried 5,200 tonnes of PPE waste to the ocean; the Indus river, which arises in western Tibet, carried 4,000 tonnes and the Yangtze river in China 3,700 tonnes. In Europe, the Danube carried the most plastic pandemic waste into the ocean: 1,700 tonnes.\nThe top 10 rivers accounted for 79% of pandemic plastic discharge, the top 20 for 91%, and the top 100 for 99%. About 73% of the discharge was from Asian rivers followed by European watercourses (11%), with minor contributions from other continents, the report said.\n\u201cThese findings highlight the hotspot rivers and watersheds that require special attention in plastic waste management,\u201d the authors said.\n\u201cWe find a long-lasting impact of the pandemic-associated waste release in the global ocean. At the end of this century, the model suggests that almost all the pandemic-associated plastics end up in either the seabed (28.8%) or beaches (70.5%).\u201d\nThe authors said the findings showed better medical waste management was needed in pandemic epicenters, especially in developing countries.",

She will decide after the Electoral Commission finishes its inquiry the Conservatives\u2019 role in helping to fund the \u00a350,000-plus refurb.\nBut on Monday Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the matter was declared in the list of ministerial interests and said there was no need for the prime minister to have registered it on the list of MPs\u2019 interests as well \u2013 putting it outside the remit of the commissioner.\nAsked if the prime minister believed Stone should be able to investigate the flat refurbishment, the spokesman said: \u201cObviously it\u2019s a matter for her on that. The interest, as you know, has been transparently declared by the prime minister following advice from Lord [Christopher] Geidt, the independent adviser.\n\u201cAnd the Commons rulebook is very clear that such ministerial code declarations do not need to be double-declared. And the flat was clearly a ministerial matter, as the PM only occupies it by virtue of his office.\u201d\nA Downing Street source dismissed Starmer\u2019s accusation that the prime minister had tried to \u201ctake down\u201d Stone, claiming it was \u201cnot true\u201d.\nLabour has repeatedly called on Stone to investigate whether Johnson should have declared a loan from a Tory donor, David Brownlow, to fund his flat redecoration. The cost has never been formally confirmed, although party accounts showed it covered a \u00a352,802 \u201cbridging loan\u201d, which was later paid by Lord Brownlow and subsequently repaid by Johnson.\nAn inquiry by Geidt, the prime minister\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial interests, found Johnson had acted \u201cunwisely\u201d by not taking enough interest in the funding of the renovations, but not broken any rules.\n\u201cIt is not for the prime minister or cabinet ministers to decide what the independent anti-corruption commissioner investigates,\u201d said Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader. Stone has previously investigated Johnson three times, including an inquiry into the funding of his holiday in Mustique by a Tory donor and the late registration of financial interests.\nJohnson was absent from parliament as MPs debated the Westminster sleaze scandal on Monday, where several Tory MPs were among those criticising the government for its efforts last week to overturn a 30-day suspension for Owen Paterson, a Conservative backbencher who broke the lobbying ban.\nIn the process, the government also tried to announce reform of the wider standards system for MPs, proposing that John Whittingdale, a cabinet minister and former boss of Johnson\u2019s wife, Carrie, should be put in charge of the shake-up. But the move was abandoned after a backlash among the public, media and MPs.\nStarmer said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tactical mistake, an innocent misjudgment swiftly corrected by a U-turn. It was the prime minister\u2019s way of doing business. A pattern of behaviour.\n\u201cWhen the prime minister\u2019s adviser on the ministerial code found against the home secretary, the prime minister kept the home secretary and forced out the adviser. When the Electoral Commission investigated the Conservative party, the prime minister threatened to shut it down. And when the commissioner for standards looked into the prime minister\u2019s donations, the prime minister tried to take her down.\u201d\nWith the prime minister taking the train back from a hospital visit in Northumberland, it was left to Stephen Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, to expressed \u201cregret\u201d in the House of Commons for the government\u2019s misjudged attempts to change the rules.\nJohnson refused to apologise for the furore over standards in an interview earlier in the day. But several Tory backbenchers were unimpressed with his refusal to attend. Mark Harper, a former chief whip, said: \u201cPolitics is a team game. It\u2019s essential to work with your colleagues to deliver anything. But if the team captain is to expect loyalty from the backbenchers and for minsters to listen to the direction of the team captain, they deserve that decisions are well thought through and soundly based.\n\u201cAs on this occasion \u2026 if the team captain gets it wrong, then I think he should come and apologise to the public and to this house. That\u2019s the right thing to do in terms of demonstrating leadership.\u201d",

The woman Arnette allegedly hit is suing him for $92,000 in damages, according to TMZ. A second lawsuit by an employee of the Aria Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas alleges that Arnette berated and spat on a valet over a dispute about retrieving his car.\nIn addition, a video surfaced late last week that shows Arnette repeatedly threatening to kill someone while brandishing what appear to be semi-automatic firearms.\n#Raiders waive CB Damon Arnette: \u201cVery painful decision. We spent significant time, effort and resources trying to help him in all aspects of his life...we cannot stand for the video of Damon with a gun, threatening to take a life.\" - #Raiders GM Mike Mayock\n\u201cVery painful decision,\u201d Raiders general manager Mike Mayock told ESPN on Monday.

We do have to be aware of Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my thing is this \u2013 in just about any mid- to big-sized city in the country, if you want to find trouble, you can find it.

        "content": "Campaigners doubt amendment creates legal duty to stop releasing raw sewage into waterways\nA government compromise aimed, ministers said, at cutting raw sewage dumping by water companies was passed by MPs on Monday after Conservative rebels backed ministers.\nCampaigners for clean water said they were disappointed that what they viewed as a less stringent amendment had been approved. They said the government\u2019s compromise was too weak and did not impose a legal duty on water companies to stop releasing raw sewage into waterways.\nBut Rebecca Pow, an environment minister, told MPs that the government\u2019s amendment did place a clear legal duty on water companies to deliver improvements to storm overflows. She said the government had taken its wording from the Lords amendment, which was supported by 22 Tory rebels last week, to place a duty on water firms in England to progressively reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows.\nLuke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said the bill as amended was not bold or tough enough. \u201cBritain is again the dirty man of Europe. Not one English river is in a healthy state \u2026 People want to see fast and bolder action from ministers.\u201d\nNeil Parish, the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, who voted against the government last week, said it had his support on Monday.\nBut he warned: \u201cWe have to make sure that we apply lots of heat to water companies to make sure they put in the investment into curing the problem \u2026 and make sure the Environment Agency and Ofwat do use their teeth against these companies.\u201d\nPhilip Dunne, Conservative MP for Ludlow, who also voted against the government previously, also supported ministers on Monday.\nThe government amendment passed on Monday states: \u201cA sewerage undertaker whose area is wholly or mainly in England must secure a progressive reduction in the adverse impact of discharges from the undertaker\u2019s storm overflows \u2026 reducing adverse impacts on the environment, and reducing adverse impacts on public health.\u201d\nPow said this amounted to a clear legal duty. \u201cI am aware of some wildly inaccurate claims which have been circulating online that we are somehow legalising the dumping of sewage. We are not.\u201d\nBut campaigners said the amendment weakened the current law and in no way matched the so-called sewage amendment drawn up by the Duke of Wellington and passed in the Lords.\nIn 2020, water companies released raw sewage into rivers more than 400,000 times over a total of 3.1m hours. The release of raw sewage via storm overflows is legal in exceptional circumstances such as extreme rain, but figures show that in many cases such discharges are happening more routinely.\nThe government\u2019s amendment passed by 283 to 163 on Monday.\nSurfers Against Sewage said after the vote: \u201cWe\u2019re hugely disappointed that the government has decided not to back the tougher Duke of Wellington amendment, which would have given them greater powers in tackling the sewage pollution emergency in our rivers and ocean.\n\u201cJust last week, UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned world leaders at Cop26 to stop treating nature \u201clike a toilet\u201d. The government has failed to fully seize the opportunity in the most urgent of environmental decades to make an example of water companies to say, \u2018If you pollute, you fix it, you pay.\u2019\n\u201cToday is just one day in the fight to end sewage pollution. Until we see the evidence of action \u2013 fewer sewage discharges; our rivers passing ecological standards, our Bathing Waters at the top of league tables; and rivers fit to swim, we will not stay silent.\u201d\nMartin Salter, of the Angling Trust, said the wording of the government\u2019s amendment was weaker than the Lords\u2019 amendment and did not go far enough. \u201cAt a time when public trust in politicians has once again been shaken, we hope MPs will stand firm, and insist on clarity and action by ministers to create a pathway out of pollution.\u201d\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has defended the amendment. The government said: \u201cThe amount of sewage discharged by water companies into our rivers is unacceptable. We have made it crystal clear to water companies that they must significantly reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows as a priority.\n\u201cWe have every confidence that the provisions in this bill will absolutely deliver progressive reductions in the harm caused by storm overflows, and any suggestion to the contrary is both disingenuous and untrue.\u201d",

A pang of guilt for having flown back from Cop26 in a private jet to get back in time for dinner with Charles Moore at the Garrick Club? A longstanding visit to a hospital that had been in the diary since at least nine o\u2019clock that morning? A three-hour search for the mask he had forgotten to bring with him to the hospital?\nWhatever the reason, Boris Johnson was conveniently out of town for the three-hour debate on parliamentary standards that the Speaker had granted at the end of the previous week. Under normal circumstances, it would have been Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, who deputised for the disappearing Boris. After all, it was house business, and Rees-Mogg was sitting on the government frontbenches, primed and pumped.\nOnly Jakey appears to have been silenced. Presumably for his part in the government\u2019s embarrassing mishandling of Owen Paterson\u2019s suspension for multiple breaches of the paid lobbying rules. Or possibly for his own good. He\u2019s not quite the uber parliamentarian he thinks he is. Anyway, Rees-Mogg did not look at all happy to have been sidelined. His face was flushed and he had the air of an overgrown schoolboy who had been caught red-handed breaking the rules. It\u2019s just that he is too arrogant to feel shame and humiliation, so his first resort is anger.\nSo it was left to Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, to take the flak. And you could see why. Because no member of the cabinet is quite so dull and forgettable. There are mornings when even his reflection doesn\u2019t recognise him. Barclay is the go-to man for when the going gets tough \u2013 it\u2019s why he was appointed Brexit secretary at a time when the government appeared to not have a clue what it was doing \u2013 because he\u2019s entirely believable when he just smiles nicely and totally misses the point. It also helps that he\u2019s so obviously not that bright, yet extremely polite with it. So attacking him for his limitations just feels like a cruel bloodsport.\nBarclay took plenty of interventions from both sides of the house, yet admirably stuck to his brief. Which was to say as little as possible other than to say a quick sorry for any mistakes that may have been made last week and to reassure everyone that he was listening. What to wasn\u2019t entirely clear. Would he apologise for the prime minister\u2019s absence? No, because that would interrupt his listening. Could he explain why Rees-Mogg wasn\u2019t leading the debate? Yes, because if he was then it would be someone else who was listening.\nWould the government accept the offer of a quick vote the following day to get rid of the sham committee it had whipped its MPs for and to approve the original committee\u2019s findings that were now in parliamentary suspended animation? A bit like Barclay himself. No, because he could only do one thing at a time and right now he was devoted to listening. Should MPs have more than one job? Yes, providing it didn\u2019t involve any extra listening.\nThe session had started with a statement from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, making clear the previous week had not been the Commons\u2019 finest hour and that he hoped the forthcoming debate would be conducted in a non-partisan manner. That lasted less than five minutes into the opening speech of Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem MP who had been granted the debate, as Labour\u2019s Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi\u2019s intervened to declare that Johnson had acted as a tinpot dictator. Hoyle sighed and cut him short. There was no need to be so harsh on tinpot dictators.\nEven so, it was hard to escape Johnson\u2019s charge sheet. Chamberlain made good inroads, accusing Boris of never accepting that the rules applied to him and his party, and of having form for making himself unavailable to parliament when there was a reckoning to be paid. But the case became utterly damning when Keir Starmer got into his stride.\nThe leader of the opposition was clearly keen to make up for the lost time when he had been at home with Covid and went the whole hog. The only way to describe Johnson\u2019s government was \u201ctotally corrupt\u201d. Hoyle let this one go. There was only so far he was prepared to go in pursuit of balance. The Paterson case was symptomatic of wider wrongdoing in the Tory government, Starmer observed. A good prime minister would have told Paterson to accept the punishment but instead he had tried to change the rules and got his ministers to trash the reputation of the commissioner for standards.\nJohnson encouraged a cynicism that devalued everything, he continued. Then there was the matter of the \u00a33m \u201ccash for a peerage\u201d scandal. Rees-Mogg looked horrified. He had no idea the asking price was so cheap. Starmer concluded with three demands. That Tory sex pest MP face a recall petition. That Paterson shouldn\u2019t be eligible for a peerage. And that there should be a proper investigation into how Randox won Covid contracts when Paterson sat in on the call with the minister involved. \u201cThe joke\u2019s not funny any more,\u201d he ended. To be fair, it hasn\u2019t been funny for a while.\nThere were fewer than 50 Tory MPs who had bothered to turn up for the debate \u2013 and most of them were ones who had defied Johnson\u2019s three-line whip. The others must have been too ashamed to attend. Or perhaps they just don\u2019t see what the problem with breaking the rules is. The only Conservative to defend Paterson was Bill Cash, a man with the unfailing knack of always missing the point. He\u2019s like an old soldier who doesn\u2019t know the war ended years ago.\nConservative Mark Harper went so far as to say that Bertie Booster should come to the Commons in person to apologise. At which point, Kevin Brennan pointed out that the prime minister\u2019s train had got in at 5pm so there was still plenty of time for him to make an appearance. But that was never going to happen. Even a token apology would suggest a vestigial trace of guilt. And Boris doesn\u2019t even have that. He\u2019s amoral to his core.\nA Farewell to Calm by John Crace is published by Guardian Faber, price \u00a39.99. To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

It is considered a \u201choly grail\u201d for vintage tech collectors.\n\u201cThat really makes it exciting for a lot of people,\u201d Corey Cohen, an Apple-1 expert, told the Los Angeles Times.\nJohn Moran Auctioneers will auction the computer off on Tuesday with bids starting at $200,000. The southern-California-based auction house estimates it will sell for between $400,000 and $600,000. Apple-1 experts told the LA Times they estimate it will fetch around $500,000. In 2014, a New York auction house sold an Apple-1 unit for $905,000.\nThe model was one of 50 sold to the ByteShop in Mountain View, California. Paul Terrell, the shop\u2019s owner, was unhappy when he first received the computers as he expected the units would be ready to be plugged in and used by the buyer. But Jobs was able to convince him he could make a profit by selling the computer with keyboards, monitors and power supplies from the shop, according to John Moran.\nA Chafee College electronics professor first purchased the computer but in 1977 sold it to a student in order to upgrade to an Apple II. The student had held on to it ever since.\nThe model has undergone an \u201cextensive authentication, restoration, and evaluation process\u201d, according to the auction house. It is one of about 60 Apple-1 units still in existence, according to the Times, and one of just 20 still functioning.\nThe model is one of six encased in Koa wood, which has since become rarer and more expensive. It comes with a Panasonic video monitor, a copy of the Apple-1 basic manual and operations guide, an original programming manual, and two Apple-1 software cassette tapes as well as three original video, power and cassette interface cables.\nJohn Moran has already received phoned-in bids, a representative told the East Bay Times, and the auction was featured in Times Square.\n\u201cWhen you see certain items, you just know that they\u2019re going to be showstoppers,\u201d Nathan Martinez, advertising and marketing director at John Moran, told the newspaper. \u201cThe Apple-1 is one of those.\u201d",

It is to kick wicked problems down the road, because the next generation needs to have something to worry about too.\nEarly indications are that the Australian Way is struggling to cut through to its key segment, Coalition voters trapped between the denial of its rural outposts and the desire for even a modicum of meaningful action from its city base.\nYou can see how the rebrand was designed to shift the PM\u2019s market position. From being caught in a binary of action/inaction, the Australian Way is positioned at the centre of a spectrum where the PM can attack opponents on the left as economy wreckers while placating those who want an end to inaction.\nBut a hill constructed on just 25% of the electorate is not one that is large enough to fight from, let alone die on; and when only just over a third of Coalition voters are on the team, with similar numbers wanting to see something more ambitious, it begins \u2013 exposed on all fronts.\nBut as we have seen over the past week, the Australian Way is about more than simply dodging accountability on climate action; it reflects a broader engagement strategy with the world.\nThe PM has shown how the Australian Way is to play friends off against each other, lurching into complex relationships like a drunk on a bender, upending tables and demanding someone buy you your next drink.\nThe Australian Way is to rat on your mates when you have a blue. It\u2019s about deflecting blame when you get called out, using others as a human shield when the heat is really on rather than taking responsibility yourself.\nThe PM\u2019s awkward performance at the global forums may have been jarring to global leaders but they are not his target audience. We are. Judging from the results in a separate question, we are less than inspired by his performance.\nThese are less than resounding reviews. Even a sizeable chunk of Coalition voters see the PM\u2019s new work as undermining our international reputation, which in another question three quarters of us say is something we, as a middle-sized power, should value highly.\nWhile these global missteps will not determine next year\u2019s election, the sober reality is that the PM returns with his lowest approval ratings since the 2020 bushfires having burnt through any brand equity built up through the pandemic.\nAustralia\u2019s uncomfortable engagement with the world has always vacillated between a cloying neediness (asking visiting celebrities \u201cwhat do you think of Australia?\u201d as they disembarked from the plane) to a bumptious exceptionalism (\u201cthe best Olympics ever!\u201d).\nThis contradiction has become more pronounced over the pandemic. We have isolated for our own protection more successfully than most, while relying on global scientific cooperation to deliver the vaccine that will allow us to live with this ongoing threat.\nBut this is not the PM\u2019s Way. For a start it leaves no one to blame if things go awry. Worse still it would require concrete action on our part as a member of that collective effort.\nRather his Australian Way is not to look too closely at these contradictions, or indeed anything at all; from \u201cBoats\u201d to \u201cDeath Taxes\u201d to \u201cScoMo\u201d it may not bear scrutiny but if it looks good out of the corner of a distracted eye then it will do.\nAs Sean Kelly writes in his excellent new book, The Game, this has been this PM\u2019s modus operandi all the way back to his time with Tourism Australia: spending $180m for an advertising campaign that reduced the nation to series of compelling but disjointed visual cliches.\nIn a similar way Kelly argues the PM has constructed himself as a \u201cflat character\u201d, a two-dimensional figure who cooks curries on Sundays for Jen and the girls and loves the Sharks and is \u201cauthentic\u201d, provided you don\u2019t look too closely.\nNow he is endeavouring to do the same thing with the nation he leads, giving the impression of movement on climate and embracing the promise of untested technologies while refusing to actually do anything different.\nUltimately that\u2019s what the PM\u2019s wants us all to do: embrace the slogans at face value so we can all feel good about ourselves without having to change anything, least of all our government.\nAfter all, isn\u2019t that the Australian Way? Aussie, Aussie, Aussie? Oi! Oi! Oi!\n Peter Lewis will be discussing the results of this week\u2019s poll results with Guardian Australia chief political correspondent Sarah Martin and The Australia Institute\u2019s Richard Dennis at 1pm on Tuesday.

What better way to finish than in my home in front of crowds.\u201d\nAlcott\u2019s triumph at the US Open in September was his third title at Flushing Meadows, adding to his two Wimbledon and three French Open wins in a career haul of 15 grand slam singles titles.\nHe has also collected eight grand slam doubles titles, along with four Paralympic gold and two silver medals, and lays claim to being the most successful quad tennis player of all time.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known this day was coming for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible ride and I think the time has come to move onto other things that I do. In saying that, I\u2019m going to train my arse off for the next two months and try and go out on a high.\u201d\nAlcott smashes the bubbly at retirement announcement pic.twitter.com/afu5BO7pWQ\nHe praised the Dutch teenager, Niels Vink, for pushing him to new levels in the most recent US Open final and on Tuesday Alcott said he felt it was the right time to stand aside and let players like Vink rise to prominence.\n\u201cThe time has come, I feel redundant, I feel old, washed up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the next generation\u2019s turn to dominate and get the recognition they deserve. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting out there and doing my thing one more time. We will see what happens. I\u2019m just enjoying the moment.\u201d\nAlcott was left a paraplegic after being born with a tumour gripping his spinal cord; surgery meant he would never walk. He was bullied for his disability during his childhood and he revealed after his US Open victory that he used to \u201chate himself so much\u201d.\n\u201cI hated my disability, I didn\u2019t even want to be here any more and then I found tennis and it changed and saved my life,\u201d he said in New York.\nAlcott\u2019s talents are not limited to the tennis court. His sporting career began as a wheelchair basketballer \u2013 he won Paralympic gold and silver medals with the Australian national team \u2013 and he since added several other strings to his bow, notably as a radio DJ and TV commentator.\nHe has also used his platform to be a vocal advocate for disability rights and helped raise awareness of mental health issues.\n\u201cI am so proud and proud of the work we have done, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a good tennis player is not the priority of my life. Being a good person is.\n\u201cBeing a good advocate and changing perceptions for people like me so they can live lives they deserve to live and get the opportunities I have had. I am so lucky.\n\u201cWe have all done this, my team, family, doubles partner, everybody that is a part of what we do. It is a big juggernaut but it has really changed perceptions, I hope, and I will never forget.\u201d\nTennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley led tributes at Alcott\u2019s announcement, saying the retiring great is \u201can incredible person\u201d.\n\u201cHis influence, infectious personality and positivity has impacted countless people, and across a far wider field than just sport or tennis,\u201d Tiley said.",

In keeping with its metabolism roots, Kurokawa, who died in 2007, had intended for the capsules to be removed and replaced every 25 years.\nBut almost half a century on, time has caught up with the structure, now shrouded in netting to keep dislodged rust and concrete from falling on to passersby.\nThe few remaining residents are now having to accept that their homes and office spaces will soon disappear, amid reports that the building could be demolished next spring.\nPreserving Nakagin in its current form has proved impossible, says Tatsuyuki Maeda, representative of the Nakagin Capsule Tower Building Preservation and Regeneration Project, as he shows the Guardian around one of the 15 rooms he has bought over the past 12 years.\n\u201cWe want the capsules to survive, although in a different form, to keep the metabolism idea alive,\u201d says Maeda, 54, who started leasing some of his rooms and conducting guided tours a decade ago to raise money to preserve the 13-storey building. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a place where people live and work. It inspires people to be creative and innovative.\u201d\nAbout 40 people have moved out since March, when the management company and capsule owners decided to sell the plot, leaving just 20 tenants \u2013 a small but eclectic band that includes an architect, a DJ, a film producer and Maeda, who works in advertising. \u201cThere are a few people who have said they never want to leave, but they\u2019ll have to get used to the idea,\u201d he says.\nPlans to remove and replace the capsules were torn up due to the high cost, logistical challenges and concern about the large quantities of asbestos inside the building. Time has not been kind to the structure, which has not had hot running water for more than a decade and, critically, does not meet Japan\u2019s strict earthquake-resistance regulations.\nNakagin\u2019s future appeared to have been secured when an overseas investor showed an interest in buying the entire building. But negotiations ended when the coronavirus pandemic prevented investors from travelling to Japan to view the property, according to Maeda, who lives nearby with his family but spends occasional nights at Nakagin.\nThe capsules\u2019 survival hinges on Maeda\u2019s project to disassemble them, remove the asbestos and donate them to museums, art galleries and other institutions in Japan and overseas \u2013 a proposal that is at least in keeping with Kurokawa\u2019s architectural philosophy.\nThe preservation group has received inquiries from museums in the US, Britain, Germany, France and Poland hoping to play their part in protecting the legacy of Japan\u2019s short-lived experiment with metabolism.\n\u201cEuropeans understand the need to preserve buildings like this, whereas Japan is still guided by a pull-down-and-rebuild mentality,\u201d says Maeda, who resolved to buy a Nakagin capsule while gazing at the building from his old workplace.\nBefore the pandemic, people from all over the world flocked to this corner of Ginza to photograph its most famous architectural landmark. Foreign visitors regularly outnumbered Japanese admirers on guided tours, and fashion houses have used its retro backdrop for photoshoots. Celebrity visitors include Hugh Jackman \u2013 Nakagin\u2019s exterior appeared in the 2013 film The Wolverine \u2013 Francis Ford Coppola and Keanu Reeves.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought the capsules would look perfect on a small island, in the middle of a forest or even on the seabed,\u201d says Maeda, who adds that he will spend a few nights at Nakagin until the capsules\u2019 fate is decided.\n\u201cIn Japan you can live in an apartment for years without even seeing your neighbours. But here everyone is friendly and ready to help each other out. We are a real community.\u201d\n This article was amended on 12 November 2021 to add further detail to the caption of the second photo.",

It said the government would \u201cco-invest with industry\u201d to install an estimated 50,000 smart chargers in homes.\nUnder questioning at a press conference in Melbourne, Morrison denied he had criticised EV technology before the last election.\nAt the time, he said battery-powered cars would not \u201ctow your trailer\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to tow your boat. It\u2019s not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family.\u201d\nHe also questioned how much EV charging stations would cost, and whether someone who owned an EV and lived in an apartment was \u201cgoing to run the extension cord down from your fourth-floor window\u201d.\nOn Tuesday, Morrison claimed his criticism had been limited to Labor\u2019s then-policy, not the technology itself. He said he did not regret saying EVs would \u201cend the weekend\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with electric vehicles, [I] have a problem with governments telling people what to do and what vehicles they should drive and where they should drive them, which is what [former opposition leader] Bill Shorten\u2019s plan was,\u201d Morrison said at Toyota\u2019s hydrogen centre in suburban Altona.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to put up the price of petrol [for] families and make them buy electric vehicles, and walk away from the things they have. That is not the Liberal way and the Nationals way.\u201d\nThe Shorten-era Labor policy was not to tell people what vehicle they should drive, require anyone to buy an EV or put up the price of petrol. It included a non-binding target of 50% new car sales being EVs by 2030 and the promise of a vehicle emissions standard to reduce the average carbon pollution of the national car fleet.\nMorrison stressed the government would not \u201cbe forcing Australians out of the car they want to drive or penalising those who can least afford it through bans or taxes\u201d.\n\u201cJust as Australians have taken their own decision to embrace rooftop solar at the highest rate in the world, when new vehicle technologies are cost-competitive, Australians will embrace them too,\u201d he said.\nThe expansion of rooftop solar \u2013 which, according to the Clean Energy Council, has now led to 3m systems being installed across the country \u2013 was encouraged for more than a decade through federal and state incentives and subsidies.\nThe government vehicle strategy suggests its approach will have only a limited impact as a climate policy. It is projected to cut greenhouse gas emissions by just 8m tonnes \u2013 less than 2% of the national annual total \u2013 over the next 14 years.\nTransport emissions are nearly 20% of the national total, were increasing rapidly before Covid-19 lockdowns and are projected to rebound in the years ahead.\nThe opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the future policy was \u201canother pamphlet, rather than a serious announcement\u201d. He said a Labor government would make EVs cheaper by removing import and fringe benefits tax.\n\u201cI think people will look at Scott Morrison today and this announcement and just shake their head and say, \u2018What\u2019s changed?\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a guy who says he\u2019s about new technology. He\u2019s resisted it.\u201d\nThe energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the government\u2019s strategy of helping install charging infrastructure, rather than phasing out fossil fuel cars, was about helping motorists \u201cembrace the increasing range of technologies available to keep them moving in an informed and fair way\u201d.\nTaylor claimed credit for the number of low emissions vehicle models available in Australia increasing by 20% over the past eight months, but did not explain how the government\u2019s policy had contributed to this.\nCar manufacturers across the globe have released a wave of new EV models as governments have announced emissions limits for passenger cars and future bans on fossil fuel cars. Industry representatives say Australians have fewer options than comparable countries due to a lack of policy support.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nTaylor said voluntary adoption was \u201cthe right pathway for reducing transport emissions over the long term\u201d.\n\u201cStringent standards, bans or regressive taxes will limit choice and increase the upfront costs of cars for Australians,\u201d he said.\nThe chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, Behyad Jafari, said the government\u2019s strategy addressed only \u201croughly 5% of the electric vehicle issue\u201d. He said it ruled out the two \u201cmost important and efficient measures\u201d to encourage EV uptake \u2013 fuel efficiency standards that would require cars to become cleaner over time, and rebates.\nHe said EVs were a \u201cmonumental opportunity\u201d for Australia that could cut emissions while \u201ccreating an innovative industry in manufacturing, technology and services\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that, against the overwhelming advice of the industry and experts, the government continues to peddle its false line that doing nothing increases choice,\u201d Jafari said. \u201cFor a strategy that has taken years to write, this leaves much to be desired.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nA study has suggested future uptake of EVs will be driven by state policies. ClimateWorks Australia, a thinktank connected to Monash University, found promised state and territory action had set a de facto national target for 2030 of at least 30% of new cars being electric. The two biggest states, New South Wales and Victoria, are aiming for EVs to make up 50% of new sales by the end of the decade.\nThe Australian Automobile Association said the government strategy included some welcome measures, but fell short of delivering the policies needed to drive uptake of clean cars.\n\u201cAustralia is a small player in the global marketplace and we need national policies that actively incentivise car brands to sell additional low emissions cars into Australia, providing Australian consumers with increased choice,\u201d managing director Michael Bradley said.\nTaylor said \u201cmany Australians\u201d were choosing new technology vehicles, citing Electric Vehicle Council data that 8,688 battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles were sold in the first half of 2021, an increase on last year.\nEVs were just 0.75% of new car sales in Australia last year, compared with 10.2% in Europe and 15% in the UK. They are nearly 80% of new sales in Norway.\nNorway and South Korea have announced a ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2025, followed by a list of countries \u2013 including the UK, Germany, India and Israel \u2013 in 2030. Japan, China and California will phase out new fossil fuel vehicle sales in 2035.\nThe Morrison government had announced plans for a national EV strategy before the last election, but changed direction after attacking Labor\u2019s plan.\nIt has rejected introducing fuel efficiency standards, which would involve setting a target to lower the average emissions from the national vehicle fleet, despite a departmental analysis in December 2016 finding the benefits in savings on fuel and reduced emissions would outweigh the costs under all scenarios examined.",

It also warned of severe penalties for people who intentionally conceal relevant information.\nChina\u2019s health commission reported another 62 locally transmitted symptomatic cases on Monday, and 43 on Tuesday, adding to the more than 940 cases recorded in at least 20 provinces nationally since October, in the country\u2019s worst outbreak since Wuhan in early 2020.\nThe government is committed to a Covid Zero strategy, and is deploying an escalating array of measures in its attempts to eliminate the virus from the community again.\nHenan province authorities have said they will \u201ccatch and kill\u201d the virus within a week, with provincial party secretary Lou Yangsheng vowing to expand lockdowns and contact tracing as necessary.\nAuthorities in Chengdu have expanded tracing measures and orders, reportedly identifying some people if their mobile phones transmitted through the same cell tower in a 14 day period.\nThe measure, dubbed \u201cspacial-temporal overlap\u201d, classifies someone as a close contact if the phone signal was within 800 square metres of a case for more than 10 minutes, or if both parties spent at least 30 hours in the identified area over the two week period.\nThe method saw authorities order about 82,000 people who had visited a massive shopping complex to get tested and then self-isolate. Video footage purported to show some people climbing over fences to escape the mandatory testing requirement.\nEarlier this month authorities locked down Shanghai Disneyland and tested all guests inside after a previous visitor was diagnosed with the illness.\nWith the outbreak continuing, health officials have called for an acceleration of booster shots and vaccinations to children.\nWang Qinghua, chief immunologist of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it was previously thought children were largely unaffected by Covid-19, but the situation had changed as the virus mutated.\n\u201cWe have seen increased infections in children, with the rates of severe illness and mortality surpassing influenza in some countries \u2026 and the hospitalisation rate for children is now more than 10 times higher than earlier this year,\u201d he said, according to state media.\nAccording to the Global Times, health authorities have set a target of vaccinating all eligible children aged 3 to 11 before the end of the year. More than 3.5m doses have been delivered to the age group so far, according to government data. Vaccinations are voluntary in China.\n This article was amended on 9 November 2021 to correct the spelling of Heihe in the text and subheading.",

I stand underneath the nearby trees, behind a hedge, the cover allowing me to watch the birds from just a few metres away, and listen to their constant contact calls of soft whistles and honks.\nMale shovelers are dipping their glistening green heads into the water and sweeping their wide bills from side to side. Two Canada geese act as sentinels, watching warily from raised ground while others feed. Near them, two Egyptian geese \u2013 the descendants of escaped birds, now breeding in the wild \u2013 are becoming agitated and start to shriek loudly. Thinking it\u2019s my presence that\u2019s disturbed them, I slink away to the next hide.\nA flock of redwings lands in the trees alongside an open field. The small thrushes, recent arrivals from northern Scandinavia and Russia, flutter among the branches, flashing the orangey patches on their flanks and calling softly. As I enter the hide, I hear another call \u2013 a kestrel\u2019s prolonged, high-pitched \u201cyikkering\u201d \u2013 coming from somewhere above the\u00a0roof. I sit down and look out through the windows.\nI don\u2019t have to wait long.

I watch the little male falcon, its grey head and russet-brown back marked with black arrowhead shapes. It looks down intently at the dark turf at its feet. Suddenly, it hops from foot to foot down the side of the mound and lunges. It flicks up its hooked beak and swallows a large black beetle.\nIt continues to hunt in this way for about 15 minutes, before bounding back on top of the mound. It turns its head round in sharp movements, bobbing its head up and down \u2013 scanning its surroundings. It\u2019s thought that these bobbing movements enable the bird to create a three-dimensional picture of the landscape, usually before flight.

        "content": "More than 90 Tory members do paid work on the side compared with very few Labour politicians, finds analysis\nMore than a quarter of Tory MPs have second jobs with firms whose activities range from gambling to private healthcare, making more than \u00a34m in extra earnings in a year, Guardian analysis has found.\nThe register of MPs\u2019 interests shows that more than 90 out of 360 Tories have extra jobs on top of their work in parliament, compared with three from Labour. They are overwhelmingly older and 86% are men. The highest earners were all former cabinet ministers.\nThe row over sleaze, including \u201cegregious lobbying\u201d by the veteran backbencher Owen Paterson on behalf of companies that paid him over \u00a3100,000 a year, has focused attention on moonlighting by MPs.\nOn Monday Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, rejected the idea of banning second jobs, saying it could stop some MPs getting experience of the outside world. They must understand, however, that \u201cin performing their parliamentary duties they are expected to act in the public interest\u201d, he said.\nThe highest earner is Andrew Mitchell, the MP for Sutton Coldfield, who made \u00a3182,600 for 34.5 days\u2019 work in a variety of financial advisory roles, with firms including Investec and EY.\nGeoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, is making around \u00a31m a year as a barrister, while Chris Grayling, the former transport secretary, is earning \u00a3100,000 a year from Hutchison Ports Europe, the register shows.\nJohn Redwood, a former Welsh secretary, is earning more than \u00a3230,000 working for an investment advisory company, Charles Stanley, and a private equity firm, while Alun Cairns, a former Welsh secretary, acts as adviser to a Wales-based global diagnostics company, BBI, with all his consultancy roles bringing in a total of \u00a360,000.\nLiam Fox, a former trade secretary, has a \u00a310,000 contract with WorldPR, a Panama-based PR company for advice on business and international politics, while Julian Smith, the former chief whip, is making about \u00a3144,000 a year from advisory roles with marine, renewables and hydrogen firms.\nAlthough ministers are not supposed to have second jobs, some have managed to hold on to them in currently unpaid capacities. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, remains an unpaid partner in Somerset Capital Management LLP, an investment management firm. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, is also still an unpaid director of Atlantic Solway Holdings, an investment company in the sport fishing sector.\nTwo Tories have jobs linked to the gambling industry: Laurence Robertson, Tory MP for Tewkesbury, gets \u00a324,000 a year to be a parliamentary adviser to the Betting and Gaming Council, while Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, is paid \u00a316,660 by GVC Holdings, owner of Coral and Ladbrokes, plus \u00a312,000 a year by the National Pawnbroking Association.\nThe Guardian reported on Sunday that more than 30 MPs have jobs that could be considered direct political consultancy, which could face a clampdown.\nHowever, dozens more have lucrative board seats and advisory council jobs that are likely to involve giving political advice. Some are also earning money through personal service companies, an arrangement that can help lower their tax bills.\nPaterson, the MP for North Shropshire, resigned following a furore over his lobbying rule-breaking and attempts by the prime minister to halt his 30-day suspension, which ended in a U-turn. MPs are banned from direct lobbying, but there are various loopholes, including being able to provide political advice to firms without carrying out advocacy themselves.\nIn contrast to the high number of Tories with second jobs, few opposition party MPs moonlight. Among Labour MPs, Rosena Allin-Khan earns extra income as a doctor, Margaret Hodge has a \u00a320,000-a-year role at Royal Holloway University and Khalid Mahmood has a \u00a325,000 advisory job at the Policy Exchange thinktank.\nThe analysis includes those with company directorships even if they are not directly salaried, but not those with unpaid roles at charities or thinktanks. It also did not count those who receive ad hoc payments for journalism, speaking at events, training, lectures or surveys \u2013 even though this is substantial additional income often earned as a result of an MP\u2019s parliamentary position.\nIt comes as research from Savanta ComRes found that almost half of UK adults oppose MPs being allowed to have a second job alongside their role in parliament, with just one in five supporting it.\nLabour proposed banning second jobs for MPs at the last election, although Starmer has stopped slightly short of endorsing that position. But Richard Burgon, formerly the shadow justice secretary, is tabling a new private member\u2019s bill to parliament that would ban all second jobs, with limited exceptions for professional MPs such as nurses and doctors to carry on their work.\nBurgon said MPs should not be \u201clining their pockets by moonlighting in other roles \u2013 and it is especially outrageous that this was happening during a public health crisis\u201d.\n\u201cThe job of being an MP is not only a great privilege, but it is also well paid, and it should be the full focus of anyone lucky enough to be elected as an MP. If people want to seek lucrative roles elsewhere, then no one is stopping them, but they should step down as MPs to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cMy bill will put an end to this racket by banning MPs from having second jobs, except in limited exceptions, for example, where nurses need to work to maintain professional registrations or so a doctor can carry on serving our NHS.\u201d\n This article was amended on 9 November 2021. Geoffrey Cox is making around \u00a31m a year as a barrister, not \u00a31.6m as an earlier version said. This has been corrected, and as a result the overall figure given in the text for extra earnings in a year has also been revised to a total of \u201cmore than \u00a34m\u201d, rather than \u201cabout \u00a35m\u201d as previously stated. The headline has also been updated to reflect this change.",

The register of MPs\u2019 interests shows it to be the case for more than 90 out of 360 Tories, compared with three from Labour. The row over sleaze, including \u201cegregious lobbying\u201d by the veteran backbencher Owen Paterson on behalf of companies that paid him over \u00a3100,000 a year, has focused attention on moonlighting by MPs. On Monday Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, rejected the idea of banning second jobs but said they must understand that \u201cin performing their parliamentary duties they are expected to act in the public interest\u201d.\nThe highest earner is Andrew Mitchell, the MP for Sutton Coldfield, who made \u00a3182,600 for 34.5 days\u2019 work in a variety of financial advisory roles, with firms including Investec and EY. Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, is making \u00a31.6m a year as a barrister, while Chris Grayling, the former transport secretary, is earning \u00a3100,000 a year from Hutchison Ports Europe, the register shows. On the Labour side, Rosena Allin-Khan earns extra income as a doctor, Margaret Hodge has a \u00a320,000-a-year role at Royal Holloway University and Khalid Mahmood has a \u00a325,000 advisory job at the Policy Exchange thinktank.\nKeir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of trying to \u201ctake down\u201d the standards watchdog for his personal interests as Downing Street made a new bid to stop the regulator investigating the controversy around the PM\u2019s flat refurbishment. Labour\u2019s Richard Burgon is tabling a private member\u2019s bill that would ban all second jobs, with limited exceptions for professionals like nurses and doctors. \u201cThe job of being an MP is not only a great privilege, but it is also well paid, and it should be the full focus of anyone lucky enough to be elected as an MP. If people want to seek lucrative roles elsewhere, then no one is stopping them, but they should step down as MPs to do so.\u201d\nRolls wins nuclear funds \u2013 Rolls-Royce will move ahead with a multibillion-pound plan to roll out a new breed of mini nuclear reactors known as SMRs after securing more than \u00a3450m from the government and investors. Ministers hope they will be quicker and cheaper to roll out, compared with large-scale reactors such as the Hinkley Point C project \u2013 initially expected to cost \u00a318bn but now slated at \u00a323bn. Rolls-Royce has promised to \u201charness decades of British engineering, design and manufacturing knowhow\u201d to roll out the first of its mini reactors which are based on a similar technology to nuclear submarines. Each of the initial run of reactors is expected to have a generation capacity of 470MW, or enough to power the equivalent of 1.3m UK homes, and cost about \u00a32bn on average.\nChild dies after dog attack \u2013 A 10-year-old boy has died following reports of a dog attack near Caerphilly in south Wales. Gwent police said they were called to an address in Pentwyn, Penyrheol, at about 3.55pm on Monday and confirmed the child had died at the scene. The dog was destroyed by firearms officers and no other animals were involved in the attack, the force said. Officers urged anyone with information to call 101.\n\u2018Hand gesture was everything\u2019 \u2013 A 16-year-old girl was rescued in Kentucky after using a hand gesture described on the social media app TikTok to signal to motorists that she was in trouble. The signal \u2013 turning the palm outwards and closing the fingers around a tucked thumb \u2013 has been demonstrated by users on TikTok and by non-profit organisations as a way for a person being abused to tell someone they are in trouble without alerting the abuser.\n\u201cThat hand gesture was everything,\u201d said Gilbert Acciardo from the Laurel county sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cHad that not been been transmitted by the young lady, had there not been someone out there that knew how to interpret what she was doing, then who knows? We might not have had a good resolution on this.\u201d\n\u2018Other factors may play a role\u2019 \u2013 White British people diagnosed with brain tumours are more likely to die within 12 months than patients from other ethnic groups, a study suggests. The research is being presented today at the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) festival. While the results show a correlation between ethnicity and survival rates, the researcher, Hiba Wanis, of King\u2019s College London, cautioned that \u201cother factors may play a role such as a patient\u2019s lifestyle and how early they received their diagnosis\u201d.\nSensible bedtime good for heart \u2013 As far as a healthy heart is concerned, the ideal bedtime is between 10pm and 11pm, a study suggests. It found a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, compared with rates among people falling asleep earlier or later at night. The study cannot prove that early or late bedtimes contribute to cardiovascular disease \u2013 but Dr David Plans from the the University of Exeter, who co-authored the study, said important cues such as exposure to morning daylight upon waking up help reset the body\u2019s internal clock each day. If the body clock is not reset properly over a long period of time, \u201cthat misalignment of behaviours and the circadian clock increases inflammation and can impair glucose regulation, both of which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease\u201d.\nFollowing the resignation of the former Conservative minister Owen Paterson, MPs have been debating changes to their disciplinary procedures and the government has been forced to defend itself against a number of allegations of \u201csleaze\u201d.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2021/11/09-09184-20211108TIFsleaze2.mp3\nWhen it was built in 1972, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was Tokyo\u2019s only example of the metabolism architectural movement. The 140 self-contained prefabricated capsules were intended by its architect, Kisho Kurokawa, to serve as pieds-\u00e0-terre for professionals who wanted to avoid long weekday commutes back and forth to suburbia.\nEach 10 square metre capsule had a unit bathroom, Sony Trinitron TV, reel-to-reel cassette/radio, rotary dial phone and a large circular window. Kurokawa, who died in 2007, had intended for them to be removed and replaced every 25 years. Almost half a century on, time has caught up with the structure, now shrouded in netting to keep dislodged rust and concrete from falling on to passersby. The few remaining residents are having to accept their homes and office spaces will soon disappear, amid reports the capsule tower could be demolished next spring.\nAzeem Rafiq has settled his employment tribunal case with Yorkshire amid praise and an apology from Kamlesh Patel, the new chair of the club, for lifting the lid on the racism he encountered while a player at Headingley.

In an interview with the Guardian, the Olympic champion Nicola Adams has revealed she kept a hammer under her bed during her violent childhood, and opened up about the inequality and sexism she overcame in boxing.\nTwo of Britain\u2019s leading sprinters, Adam Gemili and Daryll Neita, are locked in a standoff with UK Athletics after so far staying loyal to their American coach, Rana Reider, who is facing a SafeSport US investigation. Frank Lampard has held talks with Norwich City as the club\u2019s search for a new manager goes on. The Welsh Rugby Union have handed a lifetime stadium ban to the supporter who ran on to the pitch during last Saturday\u2019s defeat by South Africa. England have suffered their second major injury blow at the T20 World Cup after confirmation that Jason Roy has torn a calf muscle and will play no further part in the tournament. Mercedes believe they still have a chance of securing Lewis Hamilton\u2019s eighth world championship and have vowed to keep fighting. And Dylan Alcott, who became the first man in any form of tennis to earn the calendar year golden slam earlier this year, has called time on his career and will retire after next year\u2019s Australian Open.\nAsian shares have followed Wall Street higher in early trade. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3% early in the day. The Nikkei and China\u2019s CSI300 rose while Australian shares fell. The Hang Seng index opened up 0.65%.

        "content": "Tours of ancient catacombs run by a local group of friends are revitalising a Naples neighbourhood that was once prey to the Camorra\n\u201cIf you walked around Sanit\u00e0 15 years ago with your camera on your shoulder like that it would\u2019ve been stolen,\u201d says local shopkeeper Antonio Vitozzi, pointing at my battered Nikon. More than likely I would\u2019ve been nowhere near this neighbourhood back then. Riven by urban decay and high unemployment, Naples\u2019 poorest district used to be a dangerous place where the Camorra held sway. It wasn\u2019t just Italians afraid to come here but Neapolitans too.\nNot these days, though. Sanit\u00e0 has undergone a quite miraculous transformation thanks to La Paranza, a cooperative of idealistic young friends who began running guided tours to Italy\u2019s finest catacombs in the early 2000s. At the time, the only access to the catacombs was granted by the Catholic church for academic study.\nToday, after significant restoration funded by La Paranza, the catacombs, alongside Vesuvius, Pompeii and Herculaneum, are a must-see Neapolitan attraction, and tourism to Sanit\u00e0 has inspired new guesthouses, restaurants and employment. In its 15th year, the cooperative is launching a new above-ground walking tour this December called Luce (light), featuring specially commissioned contemporary art in neighbourhood churches.\nSanit\u00e0 lies north of Naples\u2019 historic centre. The walk there takes me along via Santa Theresa degli Scalzi, a long, straight road running towards the 18th-century Bourbon palace of Capodimonte. En route, I cross a towering bridge built in 1806, which came to symbolise the neighbourhood\u2019s decline, because its construction saw this once affluent suburb slowly bypassed by merchants and dignitaries who could travel more directly between historic Naples and Capodimonte.\nSan Gennaro\u2019s catacomb is found near a sugar-white church, a 1960s replica of St Peter\u2019s in Rome. It\u2019s here that Cooperativa La Paranza began guided tours to Naples\u2019 two most important catacombs, Gennaro and Gaudioso \u2013 the only way to see either. Enzo Porzio, 36, one of La Paranza\u2019s founders, tells me that by 2019 the catacomb tours were attracting 160,000 visitors a year.\nAs a teenager with poor employment prospects, Enzo and his neighbourhood friends in Sanit\u00e0 were galvanised by the arrival of a progressive clergyman, Antonio Loffredo. \u201cWe were young when Father Loffredo permitted us to start tours in the catacombs,\u201d he says. \u201cAt this time, we were asking ourselves what we could do as adults: should we leave Naples to work, or do something to help our community? There was much prejudice against Sanit\u00e0.\u201d\nAfter several years spent guiding as volunteers, making money only from tips, they established La Paranza in 2006 to formally launch paid tours. \u201cAs tourists came, the project started to change the neighbourhood. The Camorra\u2019s influence weakened. We created a new environment for arts, theatre, culture and archaeology to flourish. From a no-hope neighbourhood, local people saw new opportunities.\u201d The cooperative now employs 40 guides and in 2014 was a founder member of the San Gennaro Community Foundation, which finances social enterprises across the neighbourhood.\nGuided tours to the catacombs last an hour. I\u2019m led underground into San Gennaro\u2019s by Antonio Iaccarino, who now trains youngsters joining the project.\nGennaro is Naples\u2019 patron saint. Beheaded for his Christian beliefs in AD305, his remains were brought to Naples in the fifth century and his catacomb became a pilgrimage site. His bones were stolen and taken to Benevento 400 years later, before being returned to Naples in 1491. His sainthood was reaffirmed in 1631 when the parading of his relics were said to have halted an eruption of Vesuvius that threatened Naples.\nCarved from Naples\u2019 soft volcanic tuff, this catacomb dates to the second century and expanded once Gennaro was interred here. Entering the upper level, I feel lilliputian strolling through a forest of toadstools \u2013 the rounded stems of tuff supporting the ceiling of the Basilica Adjecto, where pilgrims once shuffled past empty tombs cut into the walls and arcosolia with sumptuous murals for the wealthy elite. All bones were removed in the 1960s to a nearby ossuary.\nOne ornate mural depicts a sixth-century dignitary, Theotecnus, with his wife and daughter, who died aged two years and 10 months. \u201cHe would\u2019ve been rich, because the mural was altered throughout as the family died,\u201d says Antonio. San Gennaro\u2019s own tomb is marked by a crosier, or bishop\u2019s crook. It was rediscovered in 1973, long after the catacomb had fallen out of use.\nThe catacomb\u2019s exit purposefully directs visitors towards downtown Sanit\u00e0, where I\u2019m immediately struck by its authentic intensity. Little shops and tenements fill every space. The lights twinkle on votive shrines. Conversations are suspended mid-air, shouted between balconies of buildings adorned with murals, graffiti, and often piles of rubbish. Sanit\u00e0\u2019s centrepiece is a colossal Dominican basilica, Maria della Sanit\u00e0, built in 1610, which physically fuses with the brick uprights of the overhead bridge. The basilica\u2019s side chapel hosts La Paranza\u2019s first ever accommodation, Casa del Monacone (doubles from \u20ac50 B&B). The six rooms are so popular I couldn\u2019t get a bed.\n\u201cSixteen years ago, when this opened people asked, \u2018Who would want to stay overnight in Sanit\u00e0?\u2019,\u201d shrugs Giuseppe Iaccarino, its manager. \u201cBut now Sanit\u00e0 has several hundred Airbnb. It helps locals get by renting rooms out and tourists to stay longer and spend more money,\u201d says the young entrepreneur, soon to open his own restaurant.\nOne trader benefiting from increased visitors is Antonio Vitozzi. His family butcher\u2019s began in 1823. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought a few years back I\u2019d be selling fancy meat at \u20ac50 a kilo \u2013 locals just didn\u2019t have the money. Now people from the posher parts of Naples come here to shop,\u201d he says. He invites me to his Friday steak night. I haven\u2019t the heart to tell him I\u2019m vegan.\nBut it\u2019s the reduction in violent crime that\u2019s aided Sanit\u00e0\u2019s reputational change. Antonio points me towards a memorial to 17-year-old Genny Cesarano, a lifelike depiction of the teenager adorned by the letters S.A.N (saint). He was murdered in 2015 during a drive-by Camorra shooting. \u201cThings had been getting better, so the community was shocked by this. Next day, 5,000 of us came onto the streets to demonstrate [that] we\u2019d fight to maintain the gains we\u2019re making,\u201d he adds. Subsequently, Camorra activity in Sanit\u00e0 withered away.\nThose gains include impressive developments of the arts. Funded by the community foundation, La Paranza is now hiring three more guides for its new walking tour, Luce, featuring commissioned contemporary artworks by renowned artists in Sanit\u00e0\u2019s poorest subdistrict, Cristallini. It will feature pieces in deconsecrated churches, the tour beginning at Sant\u2019Aspreno ai Crociferi, where maverick Italian artist Jago will install a sculpture entitled Pieta. One piece, Veiled Boy, is already installed in San Severo Church: a touching frieze of a child covered by a translucent shroud laid out on a tomb. The child\u2019s face is frozen in anguish. \u201cJago was influenced by the image of a migrant boy\u2019s body washed up on the coastline,\u201d says Antonio.\nElsewhere, the local youth orchestra, Sanit\u00e0 Ensemble, practises in San Severo, and I meet budding actor, 24-year-old Ciro Burzo, at Teatro Sanit\u00e0 \u2013 another church gifted by Father Loffredo. Rehearsals are under way for La Rosa del mio Giardino, a play about Dal\u00ed\u2019s love letters.\n\u201cI\u2019m a kid of Sanit\u00e0,\u201d says Burzo. \u201cThere seemed only one way out of here, to be good at football, and I wasn\u2019t. The arrival of the theatre came about because visitors needed night-time entertainment. It\u2019s changed my life, my self-belief,\u201d he says.\nBack on the tour, I return underground into San Gaudioso\u2019s catacomb, which shouldn\u2019t be missed. This Carthaginian bishop was forced into exile by the Vandals, settled in Naples and died around AD450. The catacomb is entered through a portal cut into the majolica-tiled floor of the basilica. It dates back to the fourth century and possesses outstanding ancient frescoes, although it\u2019s the later 17th-century ambulatory that\u2019s unforgettable. Here, the tomb walls portray the dead \u2013 once wealthy patrons of the basilica above \u2013 as skeletons, with a void where their heads would\u2019ve been, which once hosted their actual skulls. It reminds me of a danse macabre. The female murals wear skirts and one epitaph translates: \u201cBeauty is not immortal, time takes everything\u201d.\n\u201cIn Naples we have a weird cult worship of purgatory. People revere the bones of the nameless dead, the pezzentelle, to help them depart purgatory for heaven, but in return expect their grace and favour. It\u2019s like buying a lottery ticket,\u201d laughs Antonio. \u201cBut in 1969 Cardinal Ursi deemed it idolatrous and such sites of reverence were closed. The skulls at this catacomb were cut out. But the cult still continues in Naples.\u201d\nAnother Neapolitan church, Purgatorio ad Arco, maintains shelves of skulls in its crypt. But I end my stay at Naples Cathedral, visiting the reliquary of Gennaro, a baroque chapel housing a bone fragment of his. Two sealed ampoules of his blood are kept beneath the duomo\u2019s altar and produced three times yearly to be declared miraculous when they liquefy from their solid state. Yet San Gennaro\u2019s true miracle is how his presence in death has helped foster the resurrection of Sanit\u00e0.Guided tours cost \u20ac9 for a combined ticket to the catacombs of Saints Gennaro and Gaudioso, catacombedinapoli.com",

They dig into the rituals, culture and hierarchies of the church that silenced them.\nDirector Robert Greene\u2019s inspiration was not Spotlight, the Oscar-winning film about a church sex abuse scandal in Boston, but an August 2018 press conference with four men who spoke of being abused as boys by Catholic priests and called for grand jury-style investigations.\n\u201cI saw this news conference and I totally fell in love with these guys and I almost couldn\u2019t believe how moved I was by them,\u201d he says via Zoom from home in Columbia, Missouri. Greene and a producer made contact with the men\u2019s lawyer, Rebecca Randles, and proposed their radical idea for the film. She then approached the men with it.\nGreene, 45, recalls: \u201cOf course they were skeptical coming in. They were full of doubt. It\u2019s the most distrustful group of people for a very good reason. But I don\u2019t mind that. In fact, I celebrate that a little bit because you don\u2019t do this kind of work without a considerable amount of doubt.\n\u201cYou have to honor the risk being taken by honoring the doubt and the worry and the concern, so that worry and concern helped us build the metaphorical room that we would work in. But importantly, they always knew that in that room, there were always doors. They always had ways out. They never had to do anything.\n\u201cThe first meeting that you see in the film, I was upfront with them: \u2018Look, this could be it. We could just talk about this and maybe we decide it\u2019s not worth doing it and move on. You may think I\u2019m not serious \u2013 how could a film-maker say that? \u2013 but I\u2019m dead serious.\u2019 Part of the point of that first meeting was to decide, do we want to do this at all?\u201d\nProcession is not based on drama therapy but clearly influenced by its ideas. The six, including a location scout and interior designer, saw the potential to confront long buried parts of themselves. They took on roles in each other\u2019s stories and used the same young actor, Terrick Trobough, to play themselves in every segment.\nGreene, making his seventh feature documentary, explains: \u201cYou make art for therapeutic reasons. That idea pretty much made sense to everybody on a basic level. They might say it\u2019s weird but these are guys that Rebecca put into the room. She picked the guys that she thought could get something out of it and actually make it happen and could get through it safely.\n\u201cThe way she put it is: these are all guys who had their voice taken away at some point in the process so for those guys, it makes a lot of sense that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to make something together,\u2019 as an antidote to what happened to them. In that first meeting, Ed starts talking about, \u2018It\u2019s showtime, folks\u2019, and everyone got it.\u201d\nNone of the men regretted that choice \u2013 one describes feeling a transition from victim to survivor \u2013 although raw emotions often surfaced. Greene admits: \u201cEvery single step along the way was difficult. In fact, every step remains difficult even today, when we\u2019re talking about the film coming out or screenings that we\u2019re going to.\n\u201cNone of this is easy but it\u2019s a testament to the overall idea and the process of the film that there was never a \u2018Hey, stop recording,\u2019 because the camera being a part of it was instrumental in why they were doing things.\u201d\nIt had never been Greene\u2019s intention to take the men back to the locations where the sexual abuse took place. But Gavagan asked to return to Cheyenne, Wyoming, to revive a childhood memory of a bell he used to ring. He steps inside the church for the first time in more than 30 years.\nGreene says: \u201cYou see it in the film and he rings this bell and he\u2019s immediately brought back to his childhood in a way that is incredibly cathartic and those other guys saw it and they told the other guys and the ball started rolling.\n\u201cEd knew that he would have not done that without the guys and without the camera. Once we all realized with the guys and the camera, we\u2019re almost invincible, that\u2019s how we went into it. It was almost like, what else can we do? Because we started seeing results.\u201d\nThis is also a story of justice delayed and denied. Although four of the men received settlements from civil lawsuits, none of the accused priests was charged with a crime. Earlier this year the Vatican cleared the man who allegedly preyed on Gavagan, Bishop Joseph Hart of Cheyenne, Wyoming of multiple allegations that he sexually abused minors and teenagers.\nTo Greene, it was a pattern in which police departments are cowed by the church, courts force survivors to relive their story over and over and not even a written promise from the Pope can pierce the inertia. As the project went on, what did he observe about the legacy of abuse in these men\u2019s lives?\n\u201cThese guys, to varying degrees, consider themselves the lucky ones,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are alive and it\u2019s that simple. That\u2019s a really good way to frame what the experience of living with this trauma is like. It\u2019s just the fact that being alive is considered lucky. They didn\u2019t end up on drugs or they didn\u2019t end up suicidal. Many of them dealt with suicidal thoughts their whole lives and sometimes they didn\u2019t even know why.\n\u201cWhat you see in the film is six very different men who are in six very different places in their lives. But the common thing is this awful feeling will not go away. This feeling of shame, this feeling of being disconnected from your your childhood self.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cThe thing to know about this abuse is not just being sexually abused in such a tender age, it\u2019s being abused by an entire belief system. The Catholic church indoctrinates believers into a worldview which is demonstrated by these rituals and symbols and so it\u2019s a level of abuse that is just very difficult to comprehend. There\u2019s no fixing that. There\u2019s no giving back to these guys what was taken from them. All we could hope to do is move forward.\u201d\nProcession is out in cinemas on 12 November and available on Netflix on 19 November\nIn the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

        "content": "The left-back overcame heart surgery and now shines at Fortuna Sittard after breaking through at the wrong time with Brighton\nGeorge Cox knows how Erling Haaland feels, having spent the previous night watching Borussia Dortmund get ripped apart at the Johan Cruyff Arena. The defender\u2019s Fortuna Sittard side have regularly succumbed to Ajax, including a 5-2 defeat in Amsterdam last season. Where Cox and Haaland differ is the former Brighton man scored twice.\nA 30-yard first-time strike too hot for Andr\u00e9 Onana to handle and a second pinged across the goalkeeper into the corner made people take notice of the impact Cox was having in the Eredivisie. \u201cAfter that game, my phone had never gone so mental, it was baking hot,\u201d Cox says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sink in until a day after that I had scored two against Ajax at their stadium. Still to this day people ask me about it and it will be one of those moments that will stay with me for ever.\u201d\nPitting himself against Champions League sides attracted Cox to the Netherlands in 2019. The left-back had spent time on loan at Northampton in League Two \u2013 a stark reality check after coming through the ranks at Brighton. To avoid having his development stifled in the lower leagues, Cox took the risk of moving abroad.\n\u201cIt was key to go somewhere I would play and that\u2019s what mattered most,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go to League One, you know what it\u2019s like, if you make one mistake you are out for six weeks, which is not good for development.\u201d\nCox\u2019s success has not gone unnoticed back home and he came close to joining QPR in the summer, taking a tour of the training ground and working out where he would live before the deal fell through at the last minute. The 23-year-old knows the Championship or a move to another top-flight club abroad would be the ideal next step after more than 60 games developing at Fortuna. The left-back is being monitored by clubs in England, the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe.\n\u201cPeople are obviously telling you what needs to be better but it\u2019s not like in England where you have four or five people screaming at you. It is very competitive but there is more of a learning process to making a mistake, whereas in England you need to \u2018grow up and do this now\u2019. For younger guys this is good and for me it\u2019s been good but I am ready to take the next step now because I\u2019ve gone past this stage. Younger guys who are learning get swallowed up by the lower leagues as they just can\u2019t cope with it because if they make a mistake they\u2019re out and cannot find a rhythm.\u201d\nAt Brighton, Cox trained with the first team under Chris Hughton but never featured in a competitive match. \u201cWith the manager now [Graham Potter], I think I would have suited the way he plays. If I was two or three years younger I think I would have got the chance there but I was at a point where I was needing to play games, so had to leave. Chris was really good with me, he always had me training with the first team but I just didn\u2019t suit what he wanted from a left-back.\u201d\nAt Brighton heart monitoring detected an irregular beat which required surgery. If it had not been picked up during screening, Cox could have suffered a cardiac arrest while playing. With any sportsperson the news of a heart issue is concerning but the operation corrected the problem, allowing Cox to return to the game.\nHe has made the most of the life-changing moment. \u201cIt was a life shock, it made me appreciate things a lot more, as you never know what is around the corner. It really opened me up as a person and when it opens you up as a person, then you become more open to more stuff in normal life.\u201d\nOthers have not been as fortunate as Cox, making each time he sees a player collapse on a pitch a stark reminder of what could have happened. \u201cThe [Christian] Eriksen one was a prime example and especially with how much was caught on TV was horrendous. It might have not got to that point but the fact they found it so early makes me very lucky.\u201d\nCox is one of a number of players to show there is a different path to the perennial one-year deals in League Two. Young players and those who are not enjoying life in the lower tiers come to Cox for advice.\n\u201cPlayers who have gone down to League One or Two and it\u2019s not worked out want to know what it\u2019s like to play abroad. It is a good place for people to learn the trade.\u201d He cites the example of PSV\u2019s England Under-21 international Noni Madueke, who came through the youth ranks at Spurs. \u201cIt is a good place to play games and get experience against top teams. He is obviously playing in a top team but for me it is a case of wanting to prove yourself against sides like Ajax and PSV. It was the best thing to move here and it\u2019s paid off.\u201d",

        "content": "Scott Morrison says it\u2019s about \u2018choices, not mandates\u2019, so what\u2019s in and what\u2019s left out of the Coalition\u2019s EV and future fuels strategy?\nDays after returning from the Cop26 climate summit, the prime minister Scott Morrison has released his long-awaited policy on electric vehicles.\nMorrison, who in 2019 said Labor\u2019s EV policy would \u201cend the weekend\u201d, on Tuesday said his plan was \u201cbuilt on the back of the core principles. Technology, not taxes. Choices, not mandates\u201d.\nThe release of the future fuels and vehicles strategy represents the first substantive announcement from the government on electric vehicles. So here is an introductory guide to what\u2019s in it \u2013 and what\u2019s not.\nUnder the plan, the government says it will spend $250m \u2013 including $178m of new funding as part of a future fuels fund \u2013 to build charging stations for heavy commercial vehicles, passenger cars and households. The strategy says this investment will \u201cdeploy charging infrastructure in over 400 businesses, 50,000 households and 1,000 public charging stations\u201d. How it will do this is not explained.\nAnother \u201cpriority initiative\u201d is encouraging governments and large corporates to buy EVs for business fleets. The plan states the Department of Finance is trialling battery electric vehicles in the government\u2019s fleet of parliamentary Comcar vehicles and that hybrid vehicles make up 28% of this fleet. It says this trial will \u201cinform the government\u2019s future fleet purchasing decisions\u201d.\nUnder the plan there will be no phase-out timeline for petrol cars or targets for the take-up of zero emissions vehicles. The government says it will not introduce incentives to make it more attractive for people to buy EVs and it has ruled out introducing regulations that limit carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles.\nThe strategy is light on key details. For instance, the government is not clear about how it defines zero emissions vehicles, and at times appears to lump hybrid vehicles with pure-battery driven electric vehicles and hydrogen-electric vehicles together.\nThe \u201cfleet first\u201d strategy does not specify targets or timelines for government fleets that would encourage procurement officers to buy more EVs , and the government has only promised to \u201cevaluate\u201d the introduction of Euro 6 noxious emissions standards, which are part of a suite of regulations that ratchet up a vehicles engine efficiency up over time.\nThe Australia Institute\u2019s Audrey Quicke said the strategy \u201cshows us more what they\u2019re not doing than what they are\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much new in this policy except for some charging infrastructure, which is welcome, but it\u2019s a small piece of a thousand-piece puzzle,\u201d he said.\nThe government projects battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will make up 30% of new car sales by 2030, but has explicitly rejected the introduction of incentives to help people buy EVs and vehicle emissions standards to require a gradual shift to cleaner cars. It has not committed to the introduction of Euro6 standards on fuel quality.\nWhile the greater availability of charging infrastructure is necessary to allow EV expansion, there is nothing in the policy to help lower the cost of the vehicles themselves and make them more attractive to consumers. More work on this is being done by the states, but some are better than others. New South Wales has been praised for initiatives under its own electric vehicle strategy, which offers $3,000 rebates for the first 25,000 EVs sold in the state and exemptions on stamp duty. NSW and Victoria both plan for 50% of new cars sold to be EVs by 2030, while Tasmania plans for 100% of new cars by 2030.\nBased on electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles making up a third of all new car sales by 2030, the government projects carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 8m tonnes by 2035 \u2013 less than 2% of one year of Australia\u2019s emissions. It is not clear how this figure was reached.\nThis is only a small dent in a large section of Australia\u2019s national emissions. Transport is responsible for nearly 20% of national carbon pollution, and that share has grown steadily over time.\nWhile Morrison has stressed his government would not be \u201cputting mandates on [Australians] and telling them what to do\u201d, other countries have been setting dates to ban the sale of new petrol vehicles. Among the most ambitious are Norway and South Korea with plans to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2025. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol cars from 2030, and the sale of plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035.\nUS states like California will phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, and the Biden administration wants half of all new cars sold in the US to be electric by 2030. Meanwhile China, the world\u2019s single largest car market, has plans to end the sale of petrol and diesel passenger cars by 2035.",

        "content": "Trilogy to mark the 50th anniversary of the Crucible will have performers sprinting between stages\nActors will simultaneously perform three plays in three theatres as part of an \u201cambitious\u201d dramatic experiment to mark the 50th anniversary of the Sheffield Crucible and its sister venues.\nIn what is thought to be a theatrical first, the Crucible, Lyceum and Studio theatres will concurrently stage a trilogy of dramas featuring one set of characters. An actor who comes off stage in one theatre will appear within moments on stage in another theatre.\nRobert Hastie, the artistic director of Sheffield Theatres, is using spreadsheets and sticky notes to ensure the \u201cthe most ambitious project we have ever staged\u201d does not result in chaos.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit bonkers. We don\u2019t quite know if it\u2019s going to work. We\u2019ve got faith in ourselves and in the people we work with, but it\u2019s going to mean a lot of people putting on their trainers and sprinting between theatres,\u201d Hastie said.\nIt will be a \u201cmental challenge and a physical endurance test\u201d for the actors, but he hopes they will \u201ctake the idea and run with it\u201d.\nThe modern, brutalist Sheffield Crucible \u2013 the renowned venue for the world snooker championships as well as theatrical productions \u2013 replaced the city\u2019s Playhouse, opening its doors 50 years ago this week.\n\u201cThe Playhouse was a proscenium arch theatre, that was what the audiences understood. And here was a new building that put a thrust stage in the middle of an auditorium,\u201d said Hastie.\n\u201cThese days we\u2019re really used to three-sided and four-sided spaces. But in the 1960s, when the plans for the Crucible were being drawn, there were very few theatres in this country that weren\u2019t a traditional end-on proscenium arch.\n\u201cIt was a big gamble as to whether audiences would take it to their hearts. And there was a lot of resistance at first. Now if you suggested knocking it down and replacing it with something else, there\u2019d be campaigns and demonstrations to keep it, it\u2019s such a central part of the city\u2019s cultural life.\u201d\nThe trilogy marking the half-centenary is Rock/Paper/Scissors, written by Chris Bush, an award-winning Sheffield-born playwright whose previous works include Standing at the Sky\u2019s Edge, Hungry and The Assassination of Katie Hopkins.\nIt tells the story of Sheffield\u2019s oldest scissor manufacturer, and three generations who fight over the factory site.\n\u201cChris is fascinated by our relationship to the physical spaces we inherit,\u201d said Hastie. \u201cSo in our post-industrial northern cities, what do we do with the architecture that once housed the industrial engines of the country?\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the stories are unique to Sheffield, or limited to Sheffield. Like the Sheffield steel, the scissors that form the backstory of the play, we hope it\u2019ll be something that gets picked up around the world.\u201d\nHastie wanted to ensure that the 50th anniversary \u201cembraced all of our complex of buildings\u201d: the modern Crucible and Studio, and the traditional Lyceum across the square. Hence the Rock/Papers/Scissors trilogy, which will have a 19-day run next summer.\n\u201cThe three plays exist independently of each other, each story is self-contained. But the audience will be aware of the whole project. Hopefully, that gets them a bit closer to the workings of the whole complex. It\u2019s not just about what happens on stage.\u201d",

        "content": "Rural residents are older and poorer, are less likely to be vaccinated \u2013 and twice as likely to die of Covid as city dwellers\nIn the United States, there is a renewed campaign to vaccinate rural Americans due to the stark difference in Covid-19 cases and deaths among those living in less-populated areas compared with towns and cities.\nRural residents are now twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as Americans in metropolitan areas. Yet rural areas tend to lag at least 10% behind metropolitan areas when it comes to vaccination \u2013 and this hesitancy is exacerbating already existing health issues.\n\u201cRural populations are older, they\u2019re sicker and they\u2019re poorer,\u201d said Fred Ullrich, research analyst at the RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis and co-author of a report on Covid\u2019s disproportionate burden on rural communities.\nResidents of rural areas also tend to have lower rates of insurance, or the insurance they have doesn\u2019t cover as much, which means they may put off seeking care until it\u2019s too late. And they have worse access to healthcare itself \u2013 all of which can lead to worse Covid outcomes.\nAt the same time, rural residents have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest opposition rates to vaccination, a September survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. Urban residents, in comparison, were flipped, with one of the highest vaccination rates and the least opposition to getting vaccinated.\nAs of early October, 42.6% of rural residents were fully vaccinated, compared with 54.5% in metropolitan areas, according to an analysis by the rural-news publication the Daily Yonder. In September, rural areas saw their biggest leap in vaccinations since June before declining again in recent weeks. Even as new cases of Covid have begun falling, rural areas still have an infection rate that is 80% higher than metropolitan areas \u2013 and the death rate is still twice as high.\nNow, several initiatives are focused on working with rural communities to lower Covid cases and increase vaccination.\nThe National Rural Health Association (NRHA) recently launched an initiative to address vaccine hesitancy and to recast vaccination as a community endeavor vital for being a good neighbor and keeping schools and businesses open.\n\u201cIn rural communities, there is a lack of trust in national and even regional sources of information,\u201d Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the NRHA, told the Guardian. \u201cLocal trusted leaders have more influence on the confidence of people to receive the vaccine.\u201d\nThis campaign is reaching out to trusted sources \u2013 including physicians, leaders in community organizations and religious leaders like priests, pastors, imams and rabbis \u2013 to help them answer questions about why the vaccine is needed.\nA new series of public service messages has also been launched by the Ad Council and the Covid Collaborative, relaying the stories of everyday rural Americans and their reasons for getting vaccinated. And governors are also urged to establish trust and confidence in vaccines and to clear the way for better access in rural communities.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that many people have received contradictory messages about Covid and the vaccine from trusted sources, Ullrich told the Guardian. \u201cGetting people to change their minds is very, very difficult.\u201d\nThere are many reasons why the pandemic has hit rural residents hard.\nMore than 180 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, and people living in rural areas had a 20% greater death rate before the pandemic. Hospitals and medical centers were short-staffed to begin with, but burnout \u2013 and the temptation of higher pay in cities \u2013 has led to an exodus of experienced health workers. Smaller hospitals often don\u2019t have the budget to hire expensive travel nurses.\nThe remaining hospitals are often far away and don\u2019t offer higher levels of care like intensive care units, but many of the larger hospitals are full and can\u2019t accept transfers. And it\u2019s hard for rural residents to seek early treatments like monoclonal antibodies, which are typically offered at specialized infusion centers. Other types of health access have also worsened during the pandemic, with rural residents lacking access to high-speed internet for telehealth visits and vaccine appointments.\nThere are also disparities within the urban-rural divide. Across the US, people of color are more likely to get very sick and die from the virus than white people. But these disparities are even more pronounced in rural areas, according to a recent study. Living in a rural area as a person of color is a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d, said Kwadwo Boakye, co-author of the study.\nAt the start of the pandemic in the US, the coronavirus was often seen as an issue facing cities. For the first four months, as major metropolitan centers like New York and Los Angeles called in refrigerated trucks to handle the overwhelming crush of deaths, the virus mainly spread in the close quarters of metropolitan areas.\nBut by July, it was spreading in rural America, too \u2013 and when rates in cities began to decline, many rural areas continued adding new cases. By the fall, Covid was more common in rural areas than in cities.\nYet \u201cit\u2019s hard to get rid of that earlier notion that this really was not a rural problem,\u201d Ullrich said.\n\u201cRural is not a refuge. It\u2019s clear that the disease has sought out every corner of the country, and it doesn\u2019t make any difference where you live,\u201d Ullrich said. And while cases are falling for now, \u201cwho\u2019s to say that we won\u2019t see yet another climb up the rollercoaster?\u201d\nUllrich compared vaccination campaigns to painting a house. \u201cPainting the big walls is not a problem, but getting into the little nooks and crannies, finishing this, retouching up that \u2013 that always takes forever, right? It\u2019s always that last little bit,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe got the bulk of the population vaccinated in a relatively timely fashion, but we\u2019re down to the details now.\u201d",

        "content": "Fabiola Campillai was shot in the face by a teargas canister as she walked to work in 2019 amid nationwide protests against social inequality. Now she is running for office as an independent\nOn a November evening two years ago, Fabiola Campillai stepped out into the fading sunshine to head for her night shift at a food processing plant.\nFor weeks, Chile had been racked by a wave of mass protests against social inequality, but there were few signs of demonstrators in Cinco Pinos, the quiet neighbourhood on the outskirts of Santiago where Campillai lives.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any protests that evening. A man crossed the street in front of me to buy bread,\u201d Campillai remembers. \u201cAnd that was the last thing I ever saw.\u201d\nPatricio Maturana, an officer in Chile\u2019s Carabineros police force, fired a teargas canister at Campillai from just 50 metres away, hitting her square in the face. A study estimated that the metal cylinder would have reached temperatures of up to 200C at the moment of impact.\nFrom then on, Campillai remembers nothing.\nThe impact shattered her skull and caused cerebrospinal fluid to leak on to her brain. It blinded her totally and irreversibly, depriving her of sight, taste and smell.\nRather than helping Campillai as she lay unconscious, the officers threw more teargas, retreated down an underpass and drove away. It was left to neighbours to lift her into a car and drive to hospital.\nCampillai\u2019s horrific, life-changing ordeal has made her Chile\u2019s most recognisable victim of police brutality. After months of operations and rehabilitation, Campillai is beginning to rebuild her life in total blackness. And she is also standing as an independent candidate for Chile\u2019s senate in elections later this month \u2013 which will also see the country elect a new president.\n\u201cI will never get my eyes back,\u201d she says, the light catching two prosthetic spheres set into her reconstructed eye sockets. \u201cBut I want to turn this tragedy into a strength and keep on fighting. Not just from the streets like before, but from the legislature \u2013 I want to be there to help change everything.\u201d\nOn 21 November, Campillai will be on the ballot to become one of Santiago\u2019s five senators.\nShe is running against a former health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, who notoriously declared on television that he had \u201cno idea\u201d about the poverty and overcrowding in the southern districts of Santiago where Campillai was born and raised.\nThe porch of her one-storey home doubles as a campaign headquarters while she continues her recovery alongside her husband and three children.\nOnce a volunteer firefighter, football player and community organiser, Campillai can no longer leave the house alone or lift heavy weights, as the exertion could cause fluid to leak back into her brain.\nShe moves around the house following the edges of a carpet on the living room floor, and clings gently to her husband\u2019s waist when they walk around the neighbourhood.\nSince the protests began in October 2019, more than 400 Chileans have totally or partially lost their sight after being shot or beaten by police, and Campillai\u2019s case is one of the most emblematic.\nBody-camera footage of the attack shows a police patrol huddled tightly behind riot shields facing down a quiet street, and an officer encouraging Maturana to fire.\nWhen the teargas canister strikes Campillai, another exclaims \u201cGood shot!\u201d Later the officers discuss the incident: \u201cIt got her, right? I think [Maturana] got her, he hit her \u2026\u201d\nIt took more than eight months for the Carabineros to conclude an internal investigation and dismiss Maturana.\nHe is under house arrest while a second investigation by public prosecutors is under way, and faces 12 years in prison.\nBut the trial is yet to begin \u2013 even though more than 70 witnesses, officers and doctors have given evidence.\nA spokesperson for the Carabineros said that the force could not comment while the case was ongoing.\n\u201cNeither the government nor Carabineros have ever contacted me,\u201d says Campillai, \u201cNo help, no apology, no acknowledgment.\u201d\nBut while the wait for notional justice goes on, Campillai is working hard to launch a political career.\n\u201cA dignified Chile would have better education, healthcare, housing and pensions,\u201d she says, \u201cThis would make it a better place for the majority \u2013 and I want to be part of this movement.\u201d\nDemands for a fairer Chile have found fertile ground as the country begins to broaden participation and include independent voices from beyond the traditional parties, such as Campillai\u2019s.\nSince Chile returned to democracy after Gen Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship in 1990, only 10 independents have ever been elected to the chamber of deputies \u2013 and there has been just one independent senator.\n\u201cBefore, it was almost impossible to get elected as an independent,\u201d said Kenneth Bunker, a political scientist who edits Tresquintos, a political analysis website.\nBut a rule change for the election of the constitutional convention in May lowered barriers to participation, and 41% of the candidates were independent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that when people are given a more diverse list of candidates to choose from, they are going to elect these independents \u2013 and Campillai\u2019s story resonates with many,\u201d said Bunker.\nWhile November\u2019s election will be held under the old rules, legislation is moving through congress which would open up the playing field permanently.\nAfter months of operations and rehabilitation, Campillai is hoping to continue her education and return to work at the factory in a computer-based role.\n\u201cJustice would mean giving back what they stole from me,\u201d she says, \u201cBut that can never happen, however many years they make [Maturana] sit in jail.\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to make change happen myself. I want to send the message that politics is for everyone \u2013 not just the usual suspects.\u201d",

        "content": "As the world shifts to wind energy and electric cars, demand for the conductive metal has increased. But mining copper brings its own environmental hazards\nThis story is co-published by New Mexico In Depth and Guardian US\nCorky Stewart, a retired geologist, and his wife live in a rural subdivision in New Mexico\u2019s Grant county, about a mile north of the sprawling Tyrone copper mine.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here three years and we\u2019ve heard four blasts,\u201d Stewart said of the mine, one of four on an expanse of land partitioned into dozens of four-acre lots. From his perspective, the blasts don\u2019t seem unreasonable, given that a mining company owns the property and has the right to do what it wants.\nBut he didn\u2019t know when he bought the property that the company would propose a new pit called the Emma B just a half-mile from the wells he and his wife depend on for drinking water. \u201cIf they were to somehow tap into our aquifer and drain our water supply, then our houses become valueless,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making any effort to prevent the pit from being built,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we\u2019re really asking is for them to give us some commitment that they will fix whatever they do to our water supply.\u201d But the mine, owned by the company Freeport-McMoRan, refuses to give them this assurance, he said. Freeport-McMoRan did not respond to multiple requests for comment by New Mexico In Depth and the Guardian.\nThe company\u2019s effort to expand comes as the US expects to invest in energy sources that are cleaner than fossil fuels, and the global demand for copper rises. Copper conducts electricity, bends easily, and is recyclable \u2013 which makes it a critical material for most forms of renewable energy, from wind and solar to electric vehicles.\nBut when \u201cclean energy\u201d relies on the extraction of metals like copper, it can also pollute the surrounding environment.\nWhile Freeport-McMoRan touts sustainability practices and other measures taken to reduce the company\u2019s own greenhouse gas emissions, there\u2019s little doubt that copper mining poses significant risks to communities on the ground, threatening everything from water access to air quality to Indigenous cultural sites.\nCompanies dig huge holes into the ground, going deeper than the water table. Heavy machinery kicks up dust, polluting the air. Chemicals are used to leach the mineral out of ore, and exposed water is forever contaminated. Some operations, like Freeport\u2019s Tyrone mine, will have to pump water in perpetuity, even after there is no longer copper to be found, so that contaminated water from the mine site doesn\u2019t flow back into the wider water table.\nChris Berry, an independent analyst focused on energy metals, said the push for clean energy is a big reason for increased demand for copper, which is estimated to grow by 350% by 2050 if the world moves towards clean energy. Its price nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020 in the US.\nThat\u2019s partly because copper\u2019s role in the transition to clean energy cannot be overstated. \u201cWe\u2019re really going to have to re-engineer the electricity grid to make it cleaner and greener and more efficient. And that\u2019s going to take a lot more copper, and copper mining.\u201d\nThis reality puts environmentalists like Allyson Siwik, executive director of the Gila Resources Information Project, a local environmental advocacy organization in Grant county, in a tricky spot.\n\u201cWe are trying to transition to a clean energy economy, right?\u201d said Siwik. \u201cSo we obviously are very supportive of that.\u201d However, she adds, \u201cthe increase in global demand for these metals is very disconcerting to me. You know, it\u2019s frontline communities like us here in Grant county that bear the cost of the increased exploration, expansion of mining.\u201d\nTucked away in rural areas of Grant county in south-western New Mexico, the vast Chino and Tyrone copper mines owned by Freeport-McMoRan don\u2019t garner much attention in the state\u2019s metropolitan center. But the state ranks third in copper production nationally, and the mines employ more than 1,300 people. As demand for copper increases, local employment could grow.\nFreeport-McMoRan is betting on it.\nThe company\u2019s 2020 annual report estimates that the demand for copper will double in the next five years as a result of growth in electric vehicles and renewable technology.\n\u201cThere is an increased interest to mine copper at both existing and proposed mines to support clean energy,\u201d Holland Shepherd, manager of the mining act reclamation program at New Mexico\u2019s department of energy, minerals, and natural resources, said in an email.\nIn Sierra county, another mining company is proposing to reboot the Copper Flat mine, which briefly operated in the early 1980s before prices fell and it shut down. Themac Resources is applying for a 12-year mining permit, which also requires acquisition of enough water rights to satisfy state regulators.\nNearby, residents of the village of Hillsboro are concerned.\n\u201cWe depend on our wells here in town for all our water,\u201d said Gary Gritzbaugh, who has lived in Hillsboro for 25 years and is the president of the Hillsboro Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association. The small water association serves 80 to 90 customers and has operated for more than half a century. \u201cIt is a good system,\u201d he said, but he\u2019s deeply concerned that the mine will drain or contaminate their wells.\nGritzbaugh said that while engineers from the mining company reassured the town that contaminated water from the mine won\u2019t reach Hillsboro\u2019s water supply, he isn\u2019t certain. \u201cGroundwater is just an underground river, it goes wherever it wants to go. People say, well, it\u2019s not going to drain this way, it\u2019s going to drain towards Rio Grande. Well, maybe, maybe not.\u201d\nFor environmentalists set on reducing carbon emissions, there are no easy solutions to the threat that mining for copper and other essential minerals poses for communities like Hillsboro or rural residents like Stewart.\nNoah Long, the western region director of the climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that without an energy transition, there will be devastating consequences, some of which are already surfacing. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait,\u201d he said. But he noted the need for adequate regulation of mines, as well as reusing and then recycling electric vehicle batteries.\nEstablishing a market to recycle electric vehicle batteries \u2013 which can last a dozen or more years \u2013 could help reduce demand for copper and rein in mining operations in areas like New Mexico, where copper ore is abundant.\n\u201cWe need to shift to a policy that creates clear incentives for recycling,\u201d said Aimee Boulanger, the executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance. She noted that extracting metals is now more profitable than recycling them.\nIn 2020, an estimated 35% of copper was recycled in the US, and about a third of total global demand is met with recycled copper. But electric vehicle battery recycling is minimal. Electric vehicle batteries contain copper, nickel, cobalt and lithium; of these, cobalt and nickel are usually recoverable for new batteries, but lithium and copper are captured for use in other industries or products, or lost in the process.\nWhen lead-acid batteries came into the picture in 1859, they were rarely recycled \u2013 but now they are easily broken down for reuse. This could be the blueprint for electric vehicle batteries. China has already issued provisional regulations that encourage manufacturers to set up networks for collecting and recycling used batteries. The EU has a drafted act that tackles sustainable batteries.\nIf electric vehicles are the alternative to oil-guzzling cars, then their impact \u2013 from the mining and extraction of raw materials needed to build them to managing the waste from that process \u2013 should be addressed, said Boulanger. \u201cAnd we need to make sure that we\u2019re working to reduce that impact.\u201d\nEncouraging automakers and electronics companies to work with suppliers who source minerals responsibly is also important, environmentalists say. At the end of the day, such mines won\u2019t ever be 100% safe, said Siwik, who recently joined Indigenous tribes and environmental groups calling on the federal government to revise hardrock mining regulations.\n\u201cWe need to demand the maximum amount of environmental protection, that mines are following best management practices and being as protective as possible.\u201d That means lining stockpiles, preventing toxic pollutants from entering groundwater, mitigating air quality impacts, and ensuring that mines reclaim the land as soon as a particular mining area is used up.\nEncouraging automakers and electronics companies to work with suppliers who source minerals responsibly is also important.\nSiwik suggests an accreditation standard awarded by the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) for scoring companies\u2019 mining practices.\nIRMA was developed independently of other standards adopted by mining industry associations. It uses public audits based on social and environmental responsibility, business integrity, and what it calls \u201cplanning for positive legacies\u201d to measure performance. The results, reviewed by an independent auditor, are released with details about the mining operation, visited facilities and interviews that the auditors conducted with company representatives from across different departments.\nThe public audit covers \u201ceverything from protecting Indigenous people\u2019s rights, to biodiversity and water, to worker health and safety\u201d, said Boulanger. IRMA has already conducted public audits of a platinum mine in Zimbabwe and a lead-zinc mine in Mexico.\nTiffany\u2019s, BMW and Ford Motors have already committed to sourcing responsibly, so if a mine wants to be a part of these supply chains, they would have to adhere to high standards, said Boulanger.\nBut environmentalists worry that copper mining giants in New Mexico will be reluctant to follow such standards.\nLast year, Freeport-McMoRan announced its commitment to another standard, the Copper Mark Responsible Production Framework. Designed specifically for copper operations, it was developed by the International Copper Association, an influential trade group. This standard does not give governance and voting power to affected communities, organized labor, non-governmental environment or human rights organizations, like IRMA\u2019s multi-stakeholder system does. But Copper Mark does issue reports based on sustainability standards. And according to Shepherd, of the state energy, minerals, and natural resources department, the Copper Mark and another standard created by the industry-led Council on Mining and Metals are both good.\nBut communities affected by mine operations are often skeptical of data and reports provided by industry.\nWhen the company assures him that the water polluted by the proposed Emma B mine won\u2019t reach his water wells, Stewart is unconvinced. \u201cIt\u2019s the mine providing the data, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones paying an expert and you know, if you want an expert to say something, [you can] just pay him money.\u201d\nOnce the company has the permit, the only recourse residents like Stewart would have in the event of water contamination would be suing in court, which takes significant financial resources, he said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to hire my own hydrology firm and lawyers and all this,\u201d says Stewart.",

        "content": "A new stage production aims to tell the Sufi poet\u2019s story beyond his aphorisms \u2013 and challenge assumptions about Islam and the Middle East in the process\nHe is everywhere and nowhere. The words of Jalal al-Din Rumi are found on sunset images pasted on Instagram and coffee mugs sold on Etsy; his poems have been featured in recordings from Madonna and Coldplay and he is reputed to be the bestselling poet in the US. Rumi\u2019s observations and aphorisms on life may be endlessly cited \u2013 \u201cYou are not a drop in the ocean, you are the entire ocean in a drop\u201d \u2013 but few in the west know him as anything more than a bearded Sufi mystic.\n\u201cRumi has become a mystical, almost deified figure,\u201d says Nadim Naaman. \u201cThe reality is that he was the opposite of an untouchable deity.\u201d Naaman, a British Lebanese singer, actor and writer, has collaborated with the Qatari composer Dana Al Fardan to create Rumi: The Musical. \u201cOur approach was to take the man out of the myth,\u201d says Al Fardan, \u201cand to present him as human being.\u201d This is the second time Naaman and Al Fardan have brought a beloved Middle Eastern poet to the London stage. Their 2018 show Broken Wings, which is returning to London in the new year, was based on a novel by the Lebanese poet and writer Kahlil Gibran. It was the success of that production that convinced them there may be an appetite for a musical that delved into the life of Rumi.\nRumi was born in 1207 in present day Afghanistan. He was 36 and married with two children when he met a wandering mystic known as Shams of Tabriz. The two began what started as an intense friendship, and which might have developed into a love affair. When Shams disappeared after three years, Rumi turned to poetry to cope with the separation, writing more than 3,000 love songs to Shams, the prophet Muhammad and God.\nThe contemporary popularity of Rumi traces back to the mid-1970s and the translations of Rumi\u2019s writing by the American academic and poet Coleman Barks, who sought to foreground the timeless, universal essence in the writings. \u201cHis entire ideology is based on cultivating the essence within,\u201d says Al Fardan. \u201cRumi managed to latch on to themes and feelings that can apply to everyone,\u201d says Naaman. \u201cHe\u2019s managed to do that because his focus is on self-reflection.\u201d\nThese ideas feel timely given the pandemic and its aftermath. \u201cWe\u2019ve all reassessed our lives,\u201d says Naaman, \u201cand explored what we can do without and our place in the world.\u201d His writings may transcend time and place but Rumi was not only a mystic and philosopher \u2013 he was also a devout Muslim. These days his Muslim identity is rarely recalled by those in the west who quote him so liberally. The erasure of Rumi\u2019s Islamic identity \u2013 what one academic refers to as an act of \u201cspiritual colonialism\u201d \u2013 is also what makes a production such as this necessary. It seeks to restore a religious and geographic specificity to Rumi and in so doing challenge common tropes about the Middle East.\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of the portrayal of our region in drama, where the focus is always problematic \u2013 terrorism, refugees, war,\u201d says Naaman. \u201cThere is a lack of Middle Eastern stories and those that do exist are fictitious or very Hollywood in their interpretation. You have shows like Aladdin, The Prince of Egypt and Joseph \u2013 stories that, to a large degree, come from Middle Eastern and north African heritage, but they have historically been played by white actors with white creative teams and they\u2019re almost a pastiche. They have the right heart but they\u2019re not authentic.\u201d\nThe cast of Rumi: The Musical, by contrast, is of Middle Eastern, north African and south Asian heritage, and the 20 songs featured in the semi-staged production are all inspired by Rumi\u2019s poetry. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to bring a Middle Eastern icon to the western stage to celebrate their cultural legacy, it feels entirely right that your cast are able to be a part of that, so they are able to feel proud that they\u2019re the one telling the story from their part of the world,\u201d says Naaman.\nThe team behind the musical hope that by revealing the man behind the myth audiences may also feel able to disentangle the truth from the myths about Islam and the Middle East. \u201cThere is much more to the Middle East than they [those living in the west] have been led to believe growing up,\u201d says Naaman. \u201cSo many beautiful things on planet Earth come from that region \u2013 artistically, linguistically, musically \u2013 so much of the culture the world enjoys.\u201d\nRumi: The Musical is at the London Coliseum, 23-24 November.",

Earlier this year, Telstra was fined $50m by the federal court which found it had exploited Indigenous customers by signing them up for phone contracts they could not understand or afford.\nEach time, the onus has been on Indigenous communities to raise the alarm and bring wider attention to the issue.\nThe minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, now wants how corporations engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consumers to be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry.\nThe House Indigenous Affairs Committee, headed by Liberal MP Julian Leeser will investigate the issue, building on recent inquiries looking at Indigenous employment and small business, as well as the inquiries into some recent examples of corporate treatment of Indigenous consumers and communities.\n\u201cI think effectively, corporate Australia needs to not only talk the talk, they need to walk the walk as well,\u201d Leeser said.\n\u201cWhat we are looking at here is how corporate Australia engages in a meaningful way with Indigenous consumers and what we can do to encourage greater cultural understanding among the corporate sector of Indigenous consumers \u2013 not only where there has been bad practice, but also looking at where there has been best practice \u2013 particularly the impact of Reconciliation Action Plans in changing and improving the culture generally.\u201d\nThe destruction of Juukan Gorge, a 46,000 year-old site of global archaeological significance was found to be one of \u201ccountless instances where cultural heritage has been the victim of the drive for development and commercial gain\u201d, a parliamentary inquiry found.\nAt the time of its fine for exploiting Indigenous mobile phone plan customers \u2013 one of the largest ever handed down - Telstra chief executive Andy Penn said it was a \u201cdeeply challenging and disappointing chapter\u201d in Telstra\u2019s history.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIt was only after a long battle, led by Indigenous health groups, that Woolworths pulled the pin on its Dan Murphy\u2019s plan, with a panel commissioned by the supermarket giant in response to backlash found there was not enough consultation with the local Indigenous communities.\nAsked if it was finally time for corporate Australia to do the work, instead of leaving it for Indigenous communities to fight, Leeser said the inquiry would look at what engagement was currently occurring.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at where that has clearly fallen short in the past, and what people need to do to improve that engagement,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis will be a holistic examination of some of those past issues, but also a look at where people are getting it right and looking at what are the things that are put in place to try and steer corporate Australia in a particular direction.\u201d\nThe committee has been ordered to report back to parliament by 31 March next year \u2013 a date which could see it made obsolete if parliament is dissolved for an election before it is handed down.",

Congress, the administration, and the courts need to quickly and emphatically say no and press ahead with the investigation.\u201d\nOther DoJ veterans agree that Trump\u2019s legal case looks flimsy, but say it could stall the House inquiry.\n\u201cThe executive privilege claim against the National Archives is extremely weak,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig. \u201cThe question is whether he can game the system to run out the clock and make the requests moot.\u201d\nThat may well be the point. Trump\u2019s regular use of litigation to delay federal and state inquiries echo his modus operandi when he was president and in the business world, say experts.\n\u201cLikelihood of success on Trump\u2019s legal claims is not always or often the primary goal,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. \u201cThe primary goal, at least for the farfetched claims, is delay. If there\u2019s also a partial victory, so much the better.\u201d\nMore legal battles are pending for Trump, including claims by two women, ex- Apprentice candidate Summer Zervos and writer E Jean Carroll, who, respectively, have alleged they were sexually harassed or raped by Trump, charges he has denied.\nZervos has sued Trump for defamation and Trump, who has threatened to counter sue, faces a court order to sit for a deposition by Christmas. Similarly, a New York judge in September denied a Trump lawyer\u2019s request to pause a defamation lawsuit by Carroll against Trump.\nBut Trump\u2019s legal armada now seems focused on blocking White House records from the House committee investigating the deadly 6 January attack on Congress, which followed a Trump rally where he told a large crowd of loyalists to \u201cfight like hell\u201d, as Congress was poised to certify Biden\u2019s win.\nTrump\u2019s legal tactics fit his old playbook. \u201cHe is behaving now as he long behaved as a real estate investor and builder in the high stakes and often vicious world of New York commercial real estate,\u201d Gillers said. \u201cWhen the same tactics are employed in national politics, the victims are democracy and the nation.\u201d",

        "content": "Conservatives campaigned hard against proposed reforms while Democrats did little to promote the initiatives\nAmid an array of discouraging election results for Democrats last week, there was one under-the-radar outcome that was especially perplexing. In New York, one of the country\u2019s most progressive states, voters overwhelmingly rejected initiatives that would have expanded voting access in future elections.\nThe vote, which came in a year when Republican-led states have passed dozens of laws to restrict voting access, left voting rights advocates stunned.\nOne of the proposals would have paved the way for lawmakers to get rid of a longstanding states policy that requires voters to give an excuse if they want to vote by mail (34 states and the District of Columbia allow anyone to vote by mail for any reason). Another would have allowed people to register to vote on election day, a reform advocates believe significantly increases political participation.\nNone of the measures came anywhere close to passing. Republicans waged a well-funded and aggressive campaign to oppose the amendments, a move that caught supporters of the proposal off guard. The reforms were also hampered by low turnout and confusing wording on the ballot, which may have prompted some voters to choose to skip voting on the measures altogether.\nThe failed ballot measures mean that for now, New York will remain in a category with conservative states like Alabama, Mississippi and Texas, all of which require voters to give an excuse if they want to cast a mail-in ballot.\n\u201cThere was an assumption that of course it\u2019ll pass because it\u2019s New York. And unfortunately, we woke up Wednesday morning and saw that was definitely not true,\u201d said Sarah Goff, the deputy director of the New York chapter of Common Cause, a watchdog group that supported the measures. \u201cRepublicans and conservatives treated these ballot initiatives like essential threats and moved accordingly. And we just did not see that from the institutional supporters that we would have liked to.\u201d\nThe defeat offered a huge boon for Republicans, who are vigorously opposing Democratic efforts at the federal level to make it easier to vote. \u201cEven in deep blue New York, citizens appear to be rejecting Democrats\u2019 demands for weaker elections,\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, said on Wednesday.\nNew York\u2019s Conservative party spent $3m opposing the effort, according to the New York Times, and Republicans traveled across the state as part of a \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign. There was a heavy push to advertise online and on TV against the amendments, especially in more conservative areas of the state outside the city. Echoing national Republicans, the campaign touted the specter of voter fraud, which is extremely rare, to urge voters to vote down the measures.\n\u201cThe Republicans dedicated a significant amount of money to defeating it and did a successful job of politicizing the question,\u201d said Michael Gianaris, a Democrat in the New York state senate who backed the measures.\nNew York\u2019s Democratic party did not spend any money supporting the efforts, Jay Jacobs, the party\u2019s chair told reporters. New York state senate Democrats spent $300,000, and asked the state party for help, but got radio silence, Gianaris said.\n\u201cRepublicans spent millions of dollars upstate and on Long Island educating voters to vote no and we did not spend hardly any money or even effort to educate voters on the other side,\u201d said Jan Combopiano, senior policy director and executive committee member at the Brooklyn Voters Alliance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters if you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican or whatever \u2013 all voters, to some extent, are afraid of fraud,\u201d said Jennifer Wilson, the deputy director of the New York chapter of the League of Women Voters, a good-government group. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do a good job of reassuring voters \u2018don\u2019t worry this isn\u2019t gonna cause fraud. All it\u2019s gonna do is make voting easier.\u2019\u201d\nVoters also may have simply not understood the lengthy and complex descriptions of the proposals, printed on the back of ballots. Up to 13% of voters left each of the three questions blank. \u201cThey had so many candidates on the front side and then they flipped it over to the backside and they had a dissertation to read,\u201d Wilson said.\nA third proposal, which was more controversial, would have changed the rules around how the state draws new political districts each decade. Good-government groups were divided on that measure, a fissure that made it harder to organize a cohesive message to voters to support the ballot initiatives that would have expanded absentee voting and allowed same-day registration, Combopiano said.\nNineteen states passed 33 laws between January and the end of September that made it harder to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, and are widely seen as an effort to make it harder for minority voters to cast a ballot. Democrats have aggressively challenged the new policies in states like Georgia and Florida, both of which allow for no-excuse absentee voting, the same policy New York voters rejected on Tuesday.\nIt could be years before the proposals appear on the ballot again because amending the constitution is a years-long process in New York state.\n\u201cThese are not out-there ideas,\u201d Combopiano said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t even get these things done, we are really behind the curve.\u201d",

        "content": "Versatile actor had worked in Hollywood since childhood, and was Oscar nominated for his role in 1988 comedy Married to the Mob\nA life in pictures: Dean Stockwell\nDean Stockwell, the former child star who became a key figure in the Hollywood counter-culture and enjoyed late success in popular TV shows, has died aged 85. According to Deadline, his family said he died at home \u201cof natural causes\u201d.\nBorn in Los Angeles in 1936, Stockwell had become a major name while still in high school, starring in the anti-racism parable The Boy With Green Hair in 1948 and alongside Errol Flynn in the 1950 adaptation of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s Kim. However, Stockwell found the transition to adulthood difficult and after dropping out of university he re-established his film career with a lead role in Compulsion, the 1959 crime film based on the Leopold and Loeb murder case, for which he won a best actor award at the Cannes film festival alongside co-stars Orson Welles and Bradford Dillman.\nStockwell won another best actor award at Cannes for the 1962 adaptation of Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night, directed by Sidney Lumet, and continued working steadily on TV, but was rapidly growing disillusioned with the entertainment business; he famously joined Hollywood\u2019s Topanga Canyon hippy culture and largely dropped out of acting. In 1968, he began to return, appearing as a guru-like long-hair in Richard Rush\u2019s Psych-Out, and in 1970 in Dennis Hopper\u2019s epic The Last Movie; he later said: \u201cIt was a great pleasure to work with Dennis on it and we had a wild time down there in Peru.\u201d\nStockwell continued to associate with Hopper and other counter-culture figures such as Bruce Dern, Rip Torn and fellow former child star Russ Tamblyn, but struggled to find work in the 70s, and by the early 80s had largely switched to selling real estate. A career revival began to gather momentum after David Lynch cast him in a small role in his 1984 adaptation of Dune, followed by a larger role in Paris, Texas, after lead actor Harry Dean Stanton suggested him to director Wim Wenders. Stockwell\u2019s new cachet was cemented with a role in Lynch\u2019s next film, Blue Velvet, in which he performed a memorably creepy lip-sync to Roy Orbison\u2019s In Dreams.\nStockwell then gained an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role as a mafia boss in Jonathan Demme\u2019s 1988 comedy Married to the Mob, saying: \u201cSome people might pooh-pooh it and say it didn\u2019t mean anything, but it does. It\u2019s really gratifying to get the recognition from your peers.\u201d In 1989, he also secured probably his most high-profile TV role alongside Scott Bakula in time travel series Quantum Leap, which ran until 1993, and for which he won three Emmy awards and a Golden Globe.\nFor the next two decades, Stockwell worked steadily on TV and in Hollywood, often as authority figures; he appeared in Robert Altman\u2019s The Player, Air Force One and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Rainmaker, while on TV he had roles in JAG, Star Trek Enterprise and Battlestar Galactica. In 2015, he retired from acting following a stroke.\nStockwell was married twice: to actor Millie Perkins between 1960 and 1962, and then to Joy Marchenko from 1981 t0 2004, with whom he had two children.",

        "content": "At Cop26 Sir Patrick Vallance has said he eats less meat and cycles but society needs to change more\nChanges in behaviour are needed to tackle the climate emergency, the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said at the Cop26 summit.\nSir Patrick Vallance said behaviour change was starting to happen but needed to go further and said he cycled to work, ate less meat and had taken the train to the climate summit in Glasgow. He also said the climate crisis was a far bigger problem than coronavirus and would kill more people if immediate changes were not made.\nCanada\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Mona Nemer, said there would need to be a \u201cprofound behavioural and cultural change in terms of our relation to the Earth\u201d.\nSystemic changes are widely acknowledged as necessary to end fossil fuel burning and halt global heating, for example by switching to renewable electricity. But the role of individual behaviour is more controversial, with most politicians shying away from encouraging less meat-eating or flying.\nThe UK government recently published a study proposing taxes on high-carbon food and a reduction in frequent flying, but then swiftly withdrew it, saying: \u201cWe have no plans whatsoever to dictate consumer behaviour in this way.\u201d Cutting meat consumption in rich nations is vital to fighting the climate crisis, scientists have said.\n\u201cBehavioural change is part of [climate action],\u201d said Vallance. \u201cSome of that comes down to what we do as individuals, and some of it is what needs to happen to make things easier for us, because we can\u2019t assume that there\u2019s going to be dramatic personal behaviour change unless we can make some way of making that easier, so that the green choice is actually easy choice.\n\u201cI cycle to work, I eat less meat than I used to and I came here by train,\u201d he said. \u201cI think [behaviour change] is starting. Is it where it needs to be yet? Probably not and I think there\u2019s more to go. But I think there\u2019s a willingness and an engagement taking place that is going to be important.\u201d\nScience has been very good at detecting the changes in climate, Vallance said. \u201cWhere we have to go now is to move from diagnosis to treatment. Science is going to be crucially important, of course, for innovation, technology, and research and development to implement and scale up the technologies that we need and it\u2019s going to be important for the behavioural sciences and the other sciences crucial to actually make this work,\u201d he said.\nVallance also told the BBC on Tuesday that the climate crisis was a far bigger problem than Covid. He said that, while the pandemic had been awful, Covid might be a two- to four-year problem, rather than a 50- to 100-year problem that could be \u201creally, really damaging\u201d.\nHe stressed that people should not rely on science and technology alone to halt climate breakdown. \u201cIn the pandemic it took a concerted worldwide effort to come up with vaccines, drug treatment [and] understanding what behavioural change is necessary \u2013 the same is true for climate.\u201d\nNemer said: \u201cScience will be an absolutely essential part of the solution, both the technology but also the behaviour aspect. We\u2019re going to have to have a profound behavioural and cultural change in terms of our relation to the Earth, our relation to consumption, our relation to transport, etc, and that\u2019s something that is extremely challenging.\u201d\nBut Vallance said there was a lot of hope that the climate emergency could be ended.\n\u201cThe technologies we need are either here or are in development. If we implemented them now and scaled up, a lot of change then takes place in terms of climate emissions. The second reason for hope is we\u2019ve got a whole generation that\u2019s absolutely determined to do that. So there\u2019s behaviour change already happening right across the globe. And the third thing is that I think some of the commitments at [Cop26] are going to make a difference in terms of getting people together.\u201d",

There are about 21,000 call boxes across the country.\nFor several years, BT has been decommissioning payphones that are deemed to be no longer needed. Phone box use has plummeted as 96% of UK adults own a mobile phone. However, local organisations can buy a red phone box for \u00a31 and use it for something else. More than 6,000 have been converted to other uses, such as community libraries, or to house public defibrillators.\nOfcom said it had received a call on Tuesday from a mountain rescue team in the Lake District that was keen for its local phone box, earmarked for closure by BT, to be saved.\nSelina Chadha, the Ofcom director of connectivity, said: \u201cSome of the call boxes we plan to protect are used to make relatively low numbers of calls. But if one of those calls is from a distressed child, an accident victim or someone contemplating suicide, that public phone line can be a lifeline at a time of great need.\n\u201cWe also want to make sure that people without mobile coverage, often in rural areas, can still make calls. At the same time, we\u2019re planning to support the rollout of new phone boxes with free wifi and charging.\u201d\nAbout 5m calls were made from phone boxes in the year to May 2020, including almost 150,000 to emergency services, while 25,000 were made to ChildLine and 20,000 to Samaritans. However, call volumes from payphones have fallen from about 800m minutes in 2002 to 7m in 2020.\nUnder the plans, BT and Kcom, which operates Hull\u2019s unique cream phone boxes, must install batteries in some payphones so they can be used during a power cut.\nA BT spokesperson said: \u201cBT takes its regulatory obligations seriously in providing a public phone box service. Any phone box removals are carried out in strict adherence to Ofcom guidelines and, where appropriate, with the consent of local authorities.\n\u201cWe also know many communities love their red kiosks and, to date, more than 6,500 have been adopted across the UK via our continuing Adopt a Kiosk scheme - turning them into lifesaving defibrillator units, mini libraries, and many other new uses. BT looks forward to working constructively with Ofcom throughout the consultation process to ensure the universal service obligation meets the needs of the public today.\u201d\nUnder Ofcom\u2019s stronger rules, a phone box will be protected from removal if one of four criteria apply: its location is not covered by all four main mobile networks; it is located at an accident or suicide hotspot; more than 52 calls have been made from it over the past 12 months; or exceptional circumstances mean there is a need for a public call box.\nOfcom said BT and Kcom could propose to remove phone boxes that did not fall within these criteria, but would need to formally consult local communities before any action was taken.\n In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Ratcliffe is also aware of his responsibility to look after his seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella. But after five and a half years of no tangible progress, and most campaigning avenues exhausted, Ratcliffe, who is spending his nights outside the Foreign Office in a tent, does not yet want to back down.\nAdmitting he felt weaker, he said: \u201cI\u2019m definitely looking rougher and feeling rougher. I don\u2019t feel hungry but I do feel the cold more. It\u2019s a short-term tactic. You can\u2019t take it too long or you end up in a coma.\u201d\nUnder one plan, he will end the hunger strike when the Iranian delegation leave Cop26 in Glasgow later this week.\nHe ended a previous hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London after 15 days, but it took place in the summer.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and his deputy, Angela Rayner, visited Ratcliffe outside the Foreign Office on Tuesday, joining a steady stream of well-wishers, including MPs from all parties that are giving solidarity to his campaign.\nThe former foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the government was doing everything it could to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release.\nAsked on Sky News whether he believed payment of a \u00a3400m debt owed by the UK to Iran over a weapons deal would bring Zaghari Ractliffe and other dual nationals home, Raab said: \u201cIt is not clear to me at all and I do not think there should be a quid pro quo.\u201d\nA former Conservative minister told the Guardian: \u201cAs I understand it, the prime minister, the foreign secretary and the defence secretary all want to pay the debt, so unless they are not telling the truth, what under the British constitution is holding them back?\u201d\nHe said mechanisms had been agreed with the Iranians for the money to be paid through humanitarian channels, and commitments had been given, valuable or otherwise, that the money would not be transferred to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\nSome of Ratcliffe\u2019s friends fear he is becoming more inflexible, and unless the Foreign Office comes up with some tangible sign of progress, he could continue to a point of self-damage. It is generally accepted that after two weeks, dizziness, difficulties standing, low heart rate and chills start to intensify. Three weeks can lead to long-term complications.\nThe foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on a trip to the far east this week, spoke on the phone to the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, on Monday in what the latter described as \u201ca useful call\u201d.\nHe reiterated his demand that the UK urgently repay the \u201clong overdue\u201d \u00a3400m debt to Iran, outstanding since the 1970s.\nTruss has been privately advised by at least two former Conservative Foreign Office ministers that Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is out of prison on furlough but due to serve another year\u2019s sentence, will not be returned to the UK unless the debt is repaid. She has been detained since April 2016.\nIn a meeting with Ratcliffe shortly after he began his hunger strike, Truss was not able to give him any news on payment of the debt, leaving him frustrated at the secrecy and apparent lack of progress.\nNews of the call between the foreign ministers was released by the Iranians. The deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, will visit London, Paris and Germany later this week as part of preparations for resuming the long-delayed talks in Vienna on 29 November over the US\u2019s return to the nuclear deal.\nThe Foreign Office has assured families of British nationals that officials and ministers will raise their plight with Bagheri. It said it would use Kani\u2019s visit \u201cto press firmly for the immediate release of our unfairly detained British nationals\u201d.\nAt a weekly press conference in Tehran on Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh was asked by Iranian reporters about Ratcliffe\u2019s hunger strike. He said: \u201cHumanitarian issues must be pursued within a humanitarian context. We are sorry that some people in the UK and other countries have made humanitarian issues hostage to other political issues.\u201d",

But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s very far from it, and they are downplaying the need to get short-term targets for 2030 in line with 1.5C.\u201d\nEmissions will be twice as high in 2030 as they need to be to stay within 1.5C, based on promises made in Glasgow, CAT found. Scientists have warned that beyond 1.5C, some of the damage to the Earth\u2019s climate will become irreversible.\nThe analysts also found a chasm between what countries have said they will do on greenhouse gas emissions and their plans in reality. If current policies and measures are taken into account, rather than just goals, heating would rise to 2.7C, based on the CAT analysis.\nThe findings should serve as a \u201creality check\u201d to the talks, said Niklas H\u00f6hne, one of the authors. \u201cCountries\u2019 long-term intentions are good, but their short-term implementation is inadequate,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nThe 197 parties to the 2015 Paris agreement were asked to come to Glasgow with two aims: a long-term goal of reaching global net zero emissions around mid-century; and shorter-term national plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), pegging emissions reductions to 2030. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must fall by about 45% this decade for global temperatures to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels.\nCountries responsible for about 90% of global emissions have signed up to net zero goals, mostly by around 2050 for developed countries, rising to 2060 for China and 2070 for India, but the NDCs for actions in the next decade do not match up. The climate responds to the cumulative carbon in the atmosphere, so if emissions are high enough in the next two decades the world could surpass the 1.5C limit even if carbon reaches net zero later.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that countries have long-term net zero targets, but they need to close the gap with short-term measures,\u201d said Hare.\nThe first week of the Cop26 talks was dominated by a rush of announcements, including commitments on preserving forests, private sector finance for clean energy, and countries phasing out coal. Some of these quickly started to unravel as countries appeared to renege or clarify some of their commitments.\nAt the start of the second week of the fortnight-long talks, sharp rifts are appearing between countries that want tougher action, specifically to force countries to revise their NDCs annually if they are not in line with 1.5C, and others wanting to stick to the Paris timetable of five-yearly revisions. There are also disputes about how countries should monitor emissions, and over climate finance for poor countries.\nHare noted there was no contradiction among the varying assessments, published last week by Melbourne University and the International Energy Agency, as they came to similar conclusions based on long-term goals. CAT also found in its \u201coptimistic scenario\u201d that if all targets countries had promised were fully met, temperatures would rise by 1.8C.\nThe UN environment programme updated its analysis of the \u201cemissions gap\u201d between the cuts needed to stay within 1.5C and those offered by governments. Unep found that with the recently announced pledges by China, Saudi Arabia and others, temperatures were likely to rise by between 1.9C and 2.1C, but like the IEA and Melbourne estimates, that depended on long-term pledges being fully implemented.\nHare said many of the long-term goals countries had set out lacked credibility. He pointed to Brazil, Australia and Russia. \u201cWe are concerned that there is not a seriousness of purpose at Cop26. It\u2019s very hypothetical, getting to net zero in 2050,\u201d he said.\nH\u00f6hne said countries must agree to revise their NDCs every year if they were found insufficient, adding: \u201cIf we came back every five years that would be a very bad choice. If countries agree to come back every year, they would have a chance of closing the gap.\u201d\nJennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: \u201cThis new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It\u2019s a devastating report. We have until the weekend to turn this thing around. That means countries agreeing how they\u2019re going come back next year and every year after that until the gap to 1.5C is closed. The ministers shouldn\u2019t leave this city until they\u2019ve nailed that.\u201d\nA Cop26 spokesperson said: \u201cWe know that the window to keep 1.5C alive is closing but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that it is still achievable. As today\u2019s reports make clear, we\u2019ve seen genuine progress in the first week of Cop26, but we have a lot more to do.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe test of Cop26 has always been what concrete commitments it would deliver by 2030, the decisive decade to keep 1.5C alive. This report is an important reality check on the government\u2019s attempt to greenwash Glasgow.\u201d\nGreen party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \u201cToday was the day the sugar coating fell off the Cop26 talks to reveal the bitter pill that world leaders are going to force us to swallow if they don\u2019t take much stronger action. This report shows that action in the next 10 years is vital. Long term targets, promises and non-existent technofixes, with no actual policies to get us there, are worth nothing. It shows that most global leaders have been asleep at the wheel. This is their wake-up call.\u201d",

Of all those homeless across Britain, 22,200 are originally from EEA countries \u2013 about 9% of the total. EEA citizens in Britain have been disproportionately affected by job losses over the last 18 months, according to the research.\nIn March 2020, before the pandemic, 25% of homeless EEA nationals were unemployed. This figure jumped to 52% in the winter. For those recently experiencing rough sleeping, about half cited job loss and financial difficulties as a cause.\nFor homeless Europeans who were in employment, insecure and exploitative work was a common problem, with 28% of people forced to put up with unacceptable employment conditions such as working without a contract and having an abusive employer. Many were paid below the minimum wage or were not paid at all.\nFor those with recent experience of homelessness, nearly half had no income, with 87% living below the standard poverty line.\nJon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis, said: \u201cThis research shines a light on the fact this foundation just isn\u2019t there for many people who have made Britain their home. It\u2019s unacceptable people originally from other European countries are experiencing homelessness here and aren\u2019t able to access the system of support when something like a job loss or a health problem hits.\n\u201cThey want to contribute to their communities and given the shortage of workers in some industries right now, enabling people to do so will not only make a difference to our country, but will also make a difference to these individuals and make sure they can leave homelessness behind for good.\u201d\nThe research also identified specific barriers to support including rules limiting access and entitlement to housing and welfare support.\nCrisis is urging the government to provide a package of emergency accommodation and specialist employment support. The researchers said an estimated \u00a332m funding for long-term specialist support for EEA nationals living in Britain and experiencing rough sleeping was needed. The charity is also calling on government to stand by its commitment to end rough sleeping for all by 2024.\nOne EU rough sleeper who took part in the research said: \u201cI worked for a person for seven months and that\u2019s where I slept and received food. However, I didn\u2019t get any money. I didn\u2019t get the money after seven months of work. So that\u2019s why I was basically forced to live on the street \u2026 it was very hard.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are spending over \u00a3800m this year to tackle rough sleeping and homelessness, including a \u00a310m winter pressures fund to provide accommodation for a further 3,500 rough sleepers during the coming months.\u201d",

Ashcroft stepped down in 2015 and Magan is not eligible to sit after a bankruptcy and associated court case.\nOf the 14 former treasurers or co-treasurers moved to the Lords since 2014, 11 are still peers. While a number of these still regularly vote, almost none appear to currently sit on committees, the other main legislative business of the Lords.\nThe Conservatives have faced accusations of peerages being in effect for sale after an investigation by the Sunday Times and Open Democracy showed 16 of the Tories\u2019 main treasurers in the last 20 years, who made donations to the party of \u00a33m or above, had been made peers.\nA Scottish National party MP wrote to the Metropolitan police urging the force to open an investigation into \u201cpotential criminal misconduct regarding the procurement of \u2026 membership of the House of Lords\u201d which he said were \u201cdeeply undermining public trust and confidence\u201d.\nIn response, Scotland Yard confirmed on Tuesday that it had \u201creceived correspondence relating to recent media reports concerning the awarding of peerages\u201d and was \u201cconsidering the contents\u201d of Pete Wishart\u2019s letter. It stressed no formal assessment of the allegations had been undertaken.\nSpeaking on Monday, the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, rejected any wrongdoing, saying such people were put in the Lords because of the expertise they could bring to it. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix which brings a real depth of voices to our political parties,\u201d she said.\nHowever, Guardian analysis of official Hansard records, which examined the Lords contributions of 14 Tory treasurers in the Lords between 1996 and 2021, uncovered only a few outliers who appeared regularly involved over a sustained period of time.\nMichael Farmer, a former City trader and party treasurer made a peer by David Cameron, has spoken 222 times since joining the upper house in 2014. Howard Leigh, also made a peer by Cameron, has made 260 spoken contributions since 2013.\nJonathan Marland, a businessman made a peer in 2006, spent nearly three years working unpaid as a minister under Cameron, in the energy and business departments.\nAnother of the group, Peter Cruddas, a businessman, party donor and former co-treasurer, has spoken twice since he wasmade a peer late last year against the advice of the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Cruddas said he was a \u201cfully committed\u201d peer who had one of the best voting records since joining, and was serving on a cross-party committee to improve charity laws.\nApart from Harris, the treasurers-turned peers with the lowest level of spoken contributions were Stanley Fink, a hedge fund manager who has spoken four times since becoming a peer in 2011, and Stanley Kalms, a businessman with eight contributions since 2004, the last in 2017.\nAll the serving peers have been emailed for comment.\nAngela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, said the bulk of the former treasurers were unfamiliar faces: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recognise them. If I bumped into them in a corridor I wouldn\u2019t know if they were a member of the House of Lords or if they were just there to have lunch with someone.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably be sitting until midnight tonight. But there\u2019s some people you\u2019ll never see here at midnight, or even another time.\u201d\nThe Lib Dem leader in the Lords, Richard Newby, said: \u201cThe appointment of Tory treasurers, who typically contribute very little, if anything, to the house, is simply the most disreputable part of a thoroughly rotten system.\u201d\nA Conservative Lords spokesperson said: \u201cConservative peers play a vital role in scrutinising and revising legislation, whether that be through speaking in the house, voting, serving on committees, working with all-party groups, or raising important issues with ministers.\n\u201cMany peers balance their work in the house with roles outside of it, deepening the experience and expertise they bring to their parliamentary work.\u201d\n This article was amended on 15 November 2021. Howard Leigh has made 260 spoken contributions in the House of Lords since 2013, not 153 as an earlier version said.",

        "content": "The actor Dean Stockwell, who has died aged 85, enjoyed periods of acclaim punctuated by bouts of sometimes self-inflicted obscurity, but found his widest audience in a recurring role on television in Quantum Leap (1989-93). The series followed a physicist, Dr Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), on time-travelling expeditions to correct historical injustices. Stockwell played his sidekick, Al, who appears in hologram form.\nWhile the series used Sam\u2019s endeavours to facilitate social commentary, the cigar-chomping Al served as a comic pick-me-up: world-weary, witty, charismatic. In 1990 Stockwell won a Golden Globe for his performance.\nHis acting career began when he was seven. As a child, he was praised for performances including the title role in Joseph Losey\u2019s antiwar allegory The Boy With Green Hair (1948). As a young adult, he received awards for work such as the thriller Compulsion (1959), based on the Leopold and Loeb case. During his late-period comeback, he was used by film-makers such as Robert Altman (The Player, 1992), David Lynch (Dune, 1984; Blue Velvet, 1986) and Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas, 1984). But throughout his working life, he regarded his profession with ambivalence; this contributed to his unpredictable quality.\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a chameleon,\u201d said Jonathan Demme, who cast Stockwell as a flamboyant mafia kingpin in the 1988 comedy Married to the Mob, a performance for which the actor received his only Oscar nomination. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes him special \u2013 he has such mercurial presence.\u201d Stockwell recognised his own off-kilter appeal: \u201cIn my work, I\u2019m dealing with something that is essentially mysterious, and I prefer and am inclined to deal with it in a mysterious way.\u201d\nHe was born in Los Angeles to Harry Stockwell, an actor who provided the voice of Prince Charming in Disney\u2019s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Nina Olivette, an Italian-American vaudeville entertainer sometimes known as Betty Veronica. They separated when he was six; he and his elder brother, Guy (also an actor), remained with their mother.\nBoth siblings were appearing on Broadway in the play The Innocent Voyage when the seven-year-old Stockwell was spotted by a talent scout. He was put under contract by MGM and schooled on the studio lot in between making several films a year, including Anchors Aweigh and Abbot and Costello in Hollywood (both in 1945). At 14, he played the lead in an adaptation of Kipling\u2019s novel Kim, and was befriended by his co-star Errol Flynn, who, according to Stockwell, asked, in front of his mother, \u201cHave you had your first fuck yet?\u201d\nStockwell spoke frequently of the \u201cextreme psychological and emotional pressure\u201d to which he was subjected as a child star. \u201cA lot of demands were placed on me that should not be placed on a child, at all, ever \u2026 I resented the whole thing.\u201d Celebrity brought Stockwell no succour. \u201cI was under siege, under attack. At the end of the day, when I left MGM, there were hundreds of people waiting for me. It was a dreadful experience.\u201d\nAfter graduating from high school, he travelled and took menial jobs for five years, but returned to acting in 1957 because \u201cthere was nothing else I could do\u201d. He landed one of the leads in the Broadway production of Compulsion, and reprised the role two years later on film.\nHe starred in adaptations of DH Lawrence\u2019s Sons and Lovers (1960) and Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night (1962); the latter, directed by Sidney Lumet, won Stockwell his second Cannes film festival acting prize, shared with his cast members. (The festival had already honoured him with a solo award for Compulsion.) But his behaviour became self-destructive. He split from his wife, the actor Millie Perkins, after two years of marriage; she alleged mental cruelty. He destroyed his Cannes awards in a drunken rage.\nHe quit acting again for three years, and embraced the hedonistic culture of 1960s California, fraternising with like-minded friends including Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson and Neil Young (with whom he would co-write and co-direct the ramshackle 1982 comedy Human Highway). \u201cThe flower children and the love-ins \u2026 were the childhood I didn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. When he returned to acting in the late 60s, he was more of an outsider than ever. After several films for Roger Corman\u2019s AIP (American International Pictures), and a part in Hopper\u2019s The Last Movie (1971), film work grew scarce. During the 70s, when not appearing in curiosities (The Werewolf of Washington, 1973; Henry Jaglom\u2019s post-Vietnam drama Tracks, 1977), Stockwell could be found performing on the dinner-theatre circuit.\nHis financial situation became so dire that he decamped to Santa Fe with the intention of making a living in property. (An ad placed in 1983 reads: \u201cDean Stockwell will help you with all your real estate needs \u2026\u201d) But in 1984 a role in Lynch\u2019s science-fiction extravaganza Dune distracted him from that path. In the same year, Harry Dean Stanton, who was about to play the lead in Wenders\u2019s Paris, Texas, suggested him for a supporting part. The film won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, and helped revive Stockwell\u2019s career.\nHis fortunes changed dramatically. He starred in three films for Francis Ford Coppola, Gardens of Stone (1987), Tucker: The Man and His Dream (in which he played Howard Hughes, 1988) and The Rainmaker (1997). He was also a sinister, enigmatic presence in Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet (1986), for which he devised his character Ben\u2019s drugged, dandyish look. \u201cTo me it was the high point of the film,\u201d said his co-star Hopper. \u201cThe white makeup, the batting eyelashes \u2013 Dean has ways no other actor can touch.\u201d\nThese movies, and others including William Friedkin\u2019s To Live and Die in LA (1985) and Altman\u2019s The Player, made definitive Stockwell\u2019s return to cinema.\nThough he continued to work in that medium, his most noteworthy latter-day appearances came in science-fiction television: following Quantum Leap he had guest roles in Star Trek: Enterprise and Stargate SG-1 (both 2002), and was a regular on the highly regarded Battlestar Galactica (2006-09). He also enjoyed a career as an artist, using the name Robert Dean Stockwell to distinguish his art from his acting.\nHe is survived by two children, Austin and Sophia, from a second marriage, to Joy Marchenko, which also ended in divorce.\n Robert Dean Stockwell, actor and artist, born 5 March 1936; died 7 November 2021",

At the time, when he was working 4,000 miles away from his Devon constituency, Cox voted in the Commons by proxy.\nCox\u2019s register of interests entry shows he is being paid \u00a3400,000 a year by Withers law firm, and Labour has called on Johnson to disavow his extra work that it says is taking time away from representing constituents.\nJohnson\u2019s spokesperson said on Tuesday it was \u201cincumbent on MPs to be visible: to demonstrate to constituents that they are active on behalf of them\u201d. Asked whether Cox had failed to act in that way, he said, \u201cit is up to constituents to make that judgment\u201d.\nAsked whether there should be changes to the rules on what extra earnings MPs can have from work outside parliament, he said it would be a matter for parliament, but \u201cthe prime minister doesn\u2019t back an outright ban on second jobs\u201d.\nIn a fresh shift of position in the parliamentary standards crisis, the government will table a motion to be voted on next week rescinding last week\u2019s moves to protect Owen Paterson.\n\u201cIt will rescind the committee that was part of the amendment and allow the house to vote on the report,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said, referring to the standards committee report on Paterson\u2019s conduct.\nThe spokesperson repeatedly declined to say whether the prime minister was sorry about last week\u2019s attempt to protect Paterson from censure over paid lobbying. He said: \u201cWe fully recognise the strong feelings on this issue on both sides of the house; the government has been listening carefully to the concerns raised and has expressed regret over the mistakes made last week.\u201d\nSteve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister sent to defend the government over its handling of the sleaze row, had also avoided apologising, saying only that it was a matter of \u201cregret\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Chris Bryant, the chair of the standards committee, announced he had appointed a \u201csenior judicial figure\u201d to advise on potential reforms to the system that investigates allegations of rule-breaking against MPs. He said he was confident the current practice \u201cguarantees a fair hearing\u201d, but that the committee would \u201cconsider suggestions for improvement\u201d.\nAnneliese Dodds, Labour\u2019s chair, has written to Johnson about the latest revelations concerning Cox, and said his \u201cbehaviour raises serious questions about the conflicts of interest between MPs having second jobs that involve them lobbying or otherwise directly engaging with the government\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to show leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s past time \u2013 you should have come to the House of Commons yesterday to answer questions, apologise and act to clean up the sleaze that is drowning your party and toxifying public life.\u201d\nJohnson dodged an emergency debate in parliament on his botched bid to save Paterson by ripping up existing anti-sleaze rules, instead saying he had a longstanding engagement at a hospital in Northumberland \u2013 where he was seen not wearing a mask while meeting medical staff.\nDodds said it was incredible Cox had voted \u201cby proxy from the other side of the Atlantic\u201d and added: \u201cThe irony is not lost on me that he arrived in the Caribbean on the day that those MPs who actually feel a sense of duty to their constituents were debating global anti-corruption standards. The people of Torridge and West Devon must be wondering if Geoffrey Cox is a Caribbean-based barrister or a Conservative MP.\u201d\nCox\u2019s office has been contacted for comment.",

Her journey from the factory floor is told in this entertaining feelgood period drama, a bright and upbeat film that perhaps comes over as just a bit strenuously cheerful in places. The director is Claire McCarthy and there is a lovely performance by Phoebe Dynevor (Daphne the debutante in Bridgerton), who brings a breezy mischief and stubborn defiance to Clarice, who we meet in her early 20s working as a \u201cpaintress\u201d \u2013 hand-painting patterns on to the pottery.\nWell, to hell with all that. Clarice sees no limits to her talent; she sets her sights on becoming a \u201cmodeller\u201d, a more skilled role, traditionally men\u2019s work. Her huge talent is spotted by factory owner Colley Shorter (go-to posho Matthew Goode); and you know from the moment these two clap eyes on each other that romance is on the cards. So Clarice gets her promotion, working under a sensitive art director (nicely played by David Morrissey). Some of her male colleagues make sarky digs \u2013 \u201cwhat if she is one of them suffragettes,\u201d one sneers when Clarice is handed keys to the factory \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing too off-putting. Here and elsewhere I wondered if the film-makers have softened the edges too much, not wanting to risk making us feel bad or uncomfortable. Even the smoke chugs picturesquely out of factory chimneys.\nClarice lives at home in a two-up two-down with her mum and sister. Every second of her spare time she paints: art deco-inspired patterns on china in sunshiny bright bursts of colour. Old duffers in the industry mansplain why women won\u2019t buy her cheap and cheerful pottery (\u201cyou\u2019ll find the modern woman has a more refined taste\u201d). But Clarice knows exactly what women want (her Bizarre collection eventually sold more than 8.5m pieces). The film catches the excitement of this moment for Clarice, and Dynevor\u2019s performance is wonderful.\n The Colour Room is released on 12 November in cinemas, on Sky Cinema and on NOW.",

        "content": "Officials feared \u2018freedom day\u2019 would bring more cases and hospitalisations. But a month on, the numbers continue to drop\nWhen New South Wales exited lockdown in October, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, warned that with extra freedoms would likely come extra cases and hospitalisations.\nModelling predicted up to 1,900 daily cases during the state\u2019s first easing and a second, larger peak around Christmas. The Burnet Institute forecast hospitalisations would peak between 2,286 and 4,016 in Sydney by the end of September.\nInstead daily cases have continued to drop after \u201cfreedom day\u201d on 11 October when 446 cases were reported and 769 people were being treated for Covid in hospital.\nAlmost a month later, NSW\u2019s 14-day reference rate is below one, hospitalisations have dropped by more than two-thirds, and just 222 new Covid cases were reported on Tuesday.\nHealth experts name five key reasons why NSW has managed to keep case numbers so low while reopening its economy to the world.\nGregory Dore, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at the Kirby Institute, said the main reason case numbers were much lower than predicted was the effectiveness of the vaccine at containing outbreaks had been underestimated.\nDoherty Institute modelling that informed the national plan predicted even high levels of vaccination would not be enough to contain Covid, with 300 to 1,000 cases a day expected with \u201cmedium seeding\u201d occurring.\n\u201cModels underestimated the impact of the vaccination on transmission, and the rate of the vaccine take-up in those first few months, particularly targeted vaccination spreading to broader geographical areas,\u201d Dore said. \u201cThere was a phenomenal uptake.\u201d\nA vaccination blitz in hard-hit hotspots in NSW pushed some LGAs in south-west and western Sydney from having the lowest first-dose rate in the city to the fastest vaccination pace nationwide. On 1 August, just 33% of south-west Sydney had received a vaccination dose. Just two months later, the figure was 91.8%.\nUniversity of Sydney researchers have coined the term \u201cprotection in real-time\u201d to explain how the rapid pace of vaccine uptake may have offset the impact of waning vaccine immunity.\nOptimal immunity after vaccination comes around a fortnight after receiving a second dose. But protection against severe disease may only require a lower level of immune response, and clinical trials have found the Pfizer vaccine provides partial protection just two weeks after the first vaccination dose.\nWith a large proportion of recently vaccinated people circulating in the population, immunity levels were high, as was protection against severe infection.\nDore said the NSW government\u2019s decision to keep a short interval period between Pfizer doses also allowed NSW Health to vaccinate quickly.\n\u201cThat optimised the impact in preventing infection,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the first few months you get the best bang for your buck and reduce infectiousness if breakthrough cases occur.\u201d\nDore said as well as underestimating the effectiveness of the vaccine, modelling may also have overestimated the severity of the Delta strain.\n\u201cI think we overestimated how badly it affects your risk of developing serious disease, and overestimated the duration of stay in hospitals. The spectrum of cases in hospital were less severe than they may have originally envisaged.\u201d\nDoherty modelling predicted the Pfizer vaccine was 93% effective at reducing overall transmission of the Delta variant, and AstraZeneca was 86%. Later data from overseas has suggested Pfizer and AstraZeneca are between 94% and 96% effective at reducing hospitalisations.\n\u201cCompared to the original strain \u2026 we thought Delta would make it much more likely you\u2019d end up in hospital, putting vaccination aside,\u201d Dore said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s variable data, and it\u2019s not straightforward. But the virulence and severity of the strain was thought to be much greater, and that can have a marked impact \u2026 once you shorten the duration of the stay (in hospital) that has a cumulative effect.\u201d\nThe University of NSW epidemiologist Dr Abrar Chughtai said NSW Health had managed to keep on top of outbreaks by keeping key health measures in place after restrictions eased.\nChughtai said continuing to mandate masks in public places had prevented the spread of the virus. Testing rates, contact tracing and isolation requirements were also maintained despite caps lifting for venues.\n\u201cWhile many models predicted very high case numbers, NSW Health is still doing aggressive testing, tracing and isolating,\u201d he said.\nThe University of Sydney School of Public Health professor Alexandra Martiniuk cited the state government\u2019s \u201cgradual reopening, with vaccination being a requirement for entry in most indoor venues and social distancing measures\u201d as key to keeping cases low.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe said NSW had also maintained \u201cexcellent\u201d testing rates, with low test positivity compared with other countries with similar vaccination levels. About 0.3% of tests were coming back positive in NSW, while tests had continued to exceed 50,000 a day.\nMartiniuk said warm spring weather was likely encouraging people to socialise outdoors more than they may in other countries, but contact tracing was also key to the low positive rate.\n\u201cEighty-three per cent of results are available within one day of sample collection, and 93% of positive cases interviewed by NSW Health within 24 hours of notification,\u201d she said.\nNSW has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with first doses exceeding 93% and second doses passing 90% on Tuesday.\nThe \u201cphenomenal\u201d speed at which the nation ramped up the rollout is counter to countries like the US and the UK, which stalled after approaching the 50% mark.\nThe Doherty Institute\u2019s final report, released this month, said ongoing public health measures including testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine combined with public health and social measures were \u201ccritical interventions\u201d to achieve low case numbers.\nBut the report also acknowledged the pace of the vaccination rollout had \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d, particularly in NSW, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria which had high community transmission, placing the nation on track to reach 90% targets \u201cmuch faster\u201d than original simulations predicted.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nMartiniuk said the high vaccination rate in NSW, coupled with the stages at which it had emerged from lockdown, had managed to keep cases under control.\n\u201cNSW reopening has occurred fairly, and was done gradually, whereas the countries we often compare to reopened much sooner and more restrictions were taken away all at once, like England in July,\u201d Martiniuk said.\n\u201cSingapore (where case numbers are rising) has a higher proportion of fully vaccinated population (82%), but the majority of Singapore\u2019s vaccines were given earlier.\n\u201cSingapore also had more vaccine hesitancy in their older populations, so greater case severity and hospitalisations.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Carers use of methods such as sedating or strapping a person down more than doubles in a year\nNational disability insurance scheme providers used unauthorised restraints on clients \u2013 such as sedating or strapping down a person, or depriving them of their personal belongings \u2013 more than one million times in 2020-21.\nThe new figures, reported to federal parliament by the NDIS quality and safeguards commission, show a 240% increase on the previous 12-months and have prompted calls for an investigation.\nThe federal government last year said the commonwealth and states had agreed to \u201cwork to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, the use of restrictive practices on people with disability\u201d.\nBut Guardian Australia can reveal the NDIS quality and safeguards commission received 1,032,064 reports of unauthorised restrictive practices in 2020-21, a 240% increase on the 302,690 reports from the previous 12 months.\nIn 2020-21, there were 585,847 (56%) reports of unauthorised \u201cchemical\u201d restraint, such as the use of sedatives to manage client behaviour, a 229% increase on the 2020-21 figure.\nThe NDIS commission\u2019s own guidelines note \u201can over-reliance for the use of medication to address behaviours of concern in people with disability\u201d and warns of the possibility of long-term negative side-effects.\nThe commission said there were also 376,575 reports of the unauthorised use of \u201cenvironmental\u201d restraints, which can refer to restricting a client\u2019s access to part of their own home or denying access to personal possessions like a mobile phone or television.\nIt was notified of 63,795 instances where an unauthorised \u201cmechanical\u201d restraint was used (for example strapping a person down, or forcing them to wear splints, gloves, a helmet or other equipment) and 4,794 instances of unauthorised physical restraint. This might include physically holding a person down while they display \u201cbehaviours of concern\u201d.\nProviders also reported 789 instances of unauthorised seclusion, which refers to locking an NDIS client in a room which they can\u2019t leave.\nIn all these cases, a total of 788 NDIS providers failed to gain the proper authorisation to employ these restraints on 7,826 NDIS participants.\nThe watchdog\u2019s compliance register shows it has issued only eight compliance notices and two fines to providers that have failed to comply with restrictive practice rules.\nThe commission\u2019s annual report also shows there were a marked increase in the number of \u201creportable incidents\u201d logged during 2020-21, including alleged abuse and alleged unlawful physical/sexual contact.\nRestrictive practice is a broad term and its use is subject to a patchwork of federal and state laws and regulations.\nUnder NDIS rules, a provider must lodge a behaviour support plan with the watchdog. However, they may also need to gain permission from a state oversight body, normally known as the senior practitioner.\nThe aim of these rules is to ensure any use of restraints is subject to oversight and legal challenge. Behaviour support plans are also intended to reduce the future need for restraints, which already should be employed as a last resort.\nAn NDIS Commission spokesperson said the figures were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.\n\u201cThis volume of reports demonstrate the shocking prevalence of these practices in the disability sector in Australia and is one of our highest priorities,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cTargeted compliance action with providers who preside over significant numbers of these arrangements is under way now.\u201d\nProviders must report to the NDIS commission every time they use a restricted practice without authorisation. A person being sedated three times a day for an entire year without authorisation would count as 1,095 reportable incidents over 12 months, the commission says.\nThe disability royal commission says restrictive practices are mostly likely to be used in group homes, though they can also be employed in public settings.\nChildren and Young People with Disability Australia has reported students experiencing restraints including seclusion and being restrained with belts, while a high-profile 2015 case involved an autistic student being placed in a specially made cage.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nMore recently, the Age reported last week that a young disabled man was shackled by a hospital for five months because there was no alternative treatment or supported accommodation available.\nThe opposition\u2019s NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThere must be an independent investigation into this.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate it\u2019s not as simple as it should never happen, but the number seems way too high,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Morrison government should not walk past this confronting and disturbing evidence.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are the behavioural plans to stop unauthorised restrictive practice that should be in place?\u201d\nJordon Steele-John, the Greens disability rights spokesperson, called for a national plan to address the problem, saying \u201celimination of unauthorised restrictive practice must be the goal and it must be achieved urgently\u201d.\nHe said the practices particularly affected \u201cpeople with intellectual disability and those who are neuro-diverse\u201d.\nThe increase in the figures likely reflecting increased use and reporting from providers, Steele-John said.\n\u201cThe use of these practices, authorised or unauthorised, is a violation of someone\u2019s human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe critical difference is without authorisation you are simply using them with no plan to stop using them.\u201d\nThe NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, said it was a \u201ccomplex issue\u201d and she was working with the commission to \u201cgain a greater understanding of the nature and scale of these practices across Australia\u201d.\nShe said the commission had done important work by shining a light on the increasing use of unauthorised restrictive practices and noted it was stepping up its compliance.\n\u201cThe commission commenced reporting on these practices at a national level as this did not occur under the previous fragmented state based approach,\u201d she said.\nSenior manager of policy at People with Disability Australia, Giancarlo De Vera, also called for a national plan to address the issue, saying he had \u201cgrave concerns about the data\u201d. It suggested people with disability were \u201cnot receiving adequate supports\u201d.\nA National Disability Services spokesperson said the peak body for providers also supported uniform legislation across Australia to \u201creduce the compliance complexity\u201d.\n\u201cThe use of restrictive practices is a serious infringement of a person\u2019s rights, nonetheless there are limited circumstances where there may be no other way to ensure the safety of the person or another,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nDo you know more? luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com",

The letter was crafted specifically with the potential of public consumption in mind because the claimant appreciated Mr Markle might disclose it to the media,\u201d Caldecott said.\nMeghan\u2019s legal team are opposing the appeal and argue that the judge reached the right conclusions on the evidence before him. They also object to the introduction of Knauf\u2019s new evidence and say that, if the court accepts his statement, Meghan will also wish to put forward new evidence.\nMeghan\u2019s father shared the letter because he considered an article in US People magazine, which featured interviews with Meghan\u2019s friends portraying her as a caring daughter offering an \u201colive branch\u201d and his reply as \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d, to be a \u201cserious attack\u201d on him, Caldecott said.\nMeghan\u2019s privacy claim was \u201cdiminished and outweighed\u201d by her father\u2019s right to reply to the \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d allegations in the People article that suggested he had \u201ccruelly cold-shouldered\u201d his daughter in the run-up to her wedding to Prince Harry.\nTexts from Thomas Markle to his daughter showed he messaged her regularly, including from his hospital bed as he underwent emergency heart surgery, to let her know he would not be able to attend as doctors would not allow him to fly, Caldecott said.\nIn the texts, he told her he loved her, and wished her the best. He asked who would be giving her away, and said that if she really needed him he could come and he was sorry, the appeal judges heard.\nCaldecott said the judge did not give enough weight to the texts. They were \u201caffectionate texts\u201d, ignored in the judge\u2019s summary, and showing \u201cabundant contact\u201d in the run-up to the wedding, and painted a completely different picture to the People article that he never called, never texted and ignored her, said Caldecott.\nJudgment in the appeal will be given at a later date.",

        "content": "Andrew Gale, the Yorkshire head coach, has been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing into an offensive tweet he posted 11 years ago as the club continues to grapple with its racism scandal.\nGale, 37, replied to a message from Paul Dews, Leeds United\u2019s head of media at the time, in 2010 that included the words \u201cbutton it yid!\u201d. It resurfaced this week in the public outcry that followed Yorkshire\u2019s handling of Azeem Rafiq\u2019s allegations.\nThe former club captain, who took over as head coach in 2016, told Jewish News he was \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of the offensive nature of the term and deleted the post shortly after sending it but could now face a sanction from his employers.\nA statement from Yorkshire on Tuesday evening also disclosed that Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, is signed off work with a \u201cstress-related illness\u201d. It is understood the 61-year-old is unlikely to give evidence at parliament\u2019s digital, culture, media and sport select committee hearing next week.\nAfter settling his employment claim with the club on Monday, Rafiq called for Moxon and Mark Arthur, the chief executive, to be removed from their positions after they failed to properly escalate his initial claims of racism in 2018.\nBoth men remain employed by Yorkshire \u2013 the club said Moxon will be given \u201cthe necessary support\u201d \u2013 but are likely to have their positions reviewed in the coming weeks by Kamlesh Patel, who took over as the new chair last Friday after Roger Hutton\u2019s resignation and has since praised Rafiq for his bravery as a whistleblower.\nAs well as battling to stabilise Yorkshire\u2019s finances after an exodus of sponsors and the possibility of losing the lucrative Headingley Test match next summer, Lord Patel is launching a review of the club\u2019s reporting processes and setting up a whistleblower hotline.\nThe latter follows a number of recent allegations of racism from other former Yorkshire players, with Patel confirming the hotline will be in operation by the end of the week. \u201cWe want anyone who may have suffered issues to come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThese will be considered carefully and with due diligence.\u201d\nYorkshire also confirmed the report into Rafiq\u2019s complaints, completed in September after a 12-month investigation that Patel described as \u201cflawed\u201d, has been shared with Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS committee that will meet next Tuesday, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.\nThe report includes a number of allegations of racism from Rafiq\u2019s two spells at the club between 2008 and 2018, one of which led to the BBC pulling Radio 5 live\u2019s The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show off air on Monday evening.\nMichael Vaughan, the former England captain and now a prominent pundit, is accused of telling a group of four players of Asian heritage \u201cthere\u2019s too many of you lot, we need to do something about it\u201d before a game for the club in 2009.\nWriting in the Telegraph last week, Vaughan said he \u201ccompletely and categorically\u201d denies making the comment and did not meet the team investigating Rafiq\u2019s allegations due to concerns over confidentiality.\nThe BBC last week announced that Vaughan would not be appearing on his usual Monday night slot, with a spokesperson saying this was to \u201cmaintain the impartiality of the programme\u201d when discussing the fallout from the Yorkshire crisis.\nHowever, the Tuffers and Vaughan show was shelved completely and replaced by the Good Pace for Radio podcast hosted by England\u2019s Tymal Mills and Mark Wood that looked ahead to Wednesday\u2019s T20 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi.\nOne source at the corporation told the Guardian that proceeding with the show would have put co-host Phil Tufnell in a difficult position given his working relationship with Vaughan and the title of the show carrying both their names.\nThe show was not due to be aired next Monday due to a clash with the England football team\u2019s World Cup qualifier against San Marino.",

Messages online from anti-deportation groups said the flight departed Birmingham airport with just three deportees on board a plane able to seat 350 people.\nHome Office deportation flights to Jamaica are controversial because of the Windrush scandal. Although the Home Office says nobody from the Windrush generation is on the list, some have Windrush connections.\nThe Home Office has encountered various problems with the flight. The Covid outbreak at Colnbrook, an immigration removal centre near Heathrow, has led to some detainees being told their removal flight has been deferred; in addition, some of those due to fly on Wednesday have been identified as potential victims of trafficking as a result of county lines drug dealing, which requires further investigation.\nConcern has been raised at the highest level by the Jamaican high commissioner, Seth Ramocan, about people who have been in the UK since childhood. A survey of 17 people originally expected to fly on Wednesday, by the organisation Movement For Justice, identified at least 10 who have been in the UK since they were children. They include one man who came to Britain at the age of nine and was raised by his aunt, who was from the Windrush generation. At least 24 British children have been at risk of losing their fathers.\nAnother man, who came to the UK at the age of 10, and served an eight-year-sentence for a kidnapping offence, is suffering from dangerously high blood pressure. In the past few weeks he has been taken to hospital several times, admitted and then discharged back to the detention centre. His blood pressure has been as high as 260/150, particularly high for someone of 34. A healthy reading is in the range of 90/60 to 120/80.\nHis lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie of Leigh Day solicitors, said she had been informed his wrist was believed to have been fractured earlier on Tuesday during a restraint episode in the detention centre.\nThe Home Office said: \u201cThe Home Office reviews all reports resulting from a use of force to ensure that techniques are used proportionately, that they are justified, and are used for the minimum period required.\u201d\nOne medical assessment carried out during the man\u2019s detention states: \u201cHe needs to be released from custody as soon as practically possible as we cannot predict when he would have another massive MI, or even a stroke or fatal event. Please release him as soon as possible to avoid a major cardiovascular event.\u201d\nMcKenzie said: \u201cI am extremely concerned about our client, who has been deemed unfit to fly. It is unclear why the Home Office has chosen to be so belligerent in this case.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Stop The Plane said: \u201cWe reject the legitimacy of the entire deportation regime. It is premised on racist notions of black, brown and racialised people.\u201d\nThe Home Office said: \u201cThose individuals with no right to be in the UK and foreign national offenders should be in no doubt that we will do whatever is necessary to remove them. This is what the public rightly expects and why we regularly operate flights to different countries. All immigration removal centres have dedicated 24-hour on-site medical facilities, including access to independent doctors and nurses, with healthcare support provided throughout the removal process. An individual\u2019s medical needs are determined by an independent doctor and will always be considered when removing them.\u201d",

Her body had lain there for about six weeks.\nThe Japanese artist, described by locals in the North Yorkshire market town of Helmsley as \u201creclusive\u201d, was discovered after a pharmacist became suspicious that her siblings were buying litres of surgical spirit and \u201csmelled of dead bodies\u201d.\nHer sister Yoshika Yasutake, 55, brother Takahiro Yasutake, 49, and mother Michiko Yasutake, 78, pleaded not guilty to preventing her lawful burial in October last year. North Yorkshire police has not disclosed details of how she died.\n The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) offered no evidence at York crown court on Tuesday and Jonathan Sandiford QC said it was not in the public interest to pursue the matter to trial.\n The facts of the case were outlined at a previous hearing before Scarborough magistrates court in 2019, when the prosecution said police had been notified by a member of pharmacy staff that she had grave concerns about excessive quantities of surgical spirit a Japanese couple had been buying.\nProsecutor Sarah Tyrer told the court that \u201creference had been made that they were using it for cleansing an individual called Rina Yasutake\u201d.\n\u201cThe pharmacist noticed \u2013 and I quote \u2013 that they \u2018smelled of dead bodies\u2019,\u201d the prosecutor added. \n Later that day the police discovered Rina\u2019s body \u2013 lying on a mattress in one of the bedrooms \u201cin an advanced state of decomposition to the point of apparent mummification\u201d.\nTyrer said it was believed she had been dead for approximately six weeks. \n On Tuesday, Sandiford said any sentence following a trial would have been limited to a supervision order or an absolute discharge.\nThe matter would be left on file, with the understanding that the three defendants would accept any welfare checks or visits by social services or the police in Helmsley. \n The judge added that a trial would put the criminal courts \u201cto vast expense and time in these troubled times when really it would be to no end\u201d.\nMorris described the \u201chighly unusual circumstances\u201d that led to him being asked to allow the case to lie on file. \u201cBut unique cases and unique circumstances require unique disposal,\u201d he said. \n After the discovery of Yasutake\u2019s body three years ago, her former classmate Sarah Matthews said she had been \u201ca very hard-working teenager with a bright academic future\u201d.\nThe pair shared a dormitory at Queen Mary\u2019s boarding school for girls in the late 1980s, and Matthews thought she had gone on to study at Cambridge University.\nA joint statement from North Yorkshire police and the CPS described the matter as a \u201cvery complex, sensitive and sad case\u201d.\nIt said the decision not to proceed had been considered at the highest level within CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, and in discussion with the police.\n\u201cIt was agreed that it was not in the public interest to prosecute, and that the case should be left to lie on file,\u201d it said.",

        "content": "The UK discount retailer\u2019s stateside adventure looks more credible than others who went before it\nThe US is the graveyard of UK retailers, runs ancient retailing wisdom that was reinforced when Tesco fell flat on its face, and lost the thick end of $2bn, by backing a venture called Fresh & Easy a decade ago.\nPrimark, AB Foods\u2019 discount clothes retailer, is actually Irish, so won\u2019t count towards the tally even if its new US push fails. But there are at least a couple of reasons why this stateside adventure, which will take store numbers from 13 to 60 over five years, looks a more credible proposition than Tesco\u2019s ego-driven expansion.\nFirst, ABF opened its first Primark in the US almost five years ago and spent time tweaking the format for local tastes. The chief conclusion, perhaps counterintuitive, is that stores should be smaller than European versions to achieve similar financial returns.\nTesco also claimed to have done its research, of course, but none of it amounted to waiting for profits before committing more capital. When early sales levels disappointed, the supermarket group concluded, optimistically, that what it really needed was more outlets to achieve efficiencies. An intended low-risk experiment quickly became a costly blunder.\nSecond, Primark is confident it scores better on price than local rivals while offering more fashion pizzazz. Tesco was in a different game. It was pushing an upmarket format that was unlike its UK model but looked similar to those of established west-coast chains such as Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Food Markets. It wasn\u2019t offering anything new.\nNone of which guarantees that Primark will win in the US, but the refusal to offer an online transactional website \u2013 which has been cited for years to predict \u201cpeak Primark\u201d \u2013 suddenly looks less and less of a danger. Retail property, for those who can bring in loyal punters, is very cheap these days.\nBitcoin is soaring to new price highs because it is a hedge against inflation and a form of \u201cdigital gold\u201d, says a currently popular refrain. It makes no sense.\nThe point about gold is that it has earned its reputation as a store of value (and not always reliably, it should be said) over a couple of thousand years and over many inflationary cycles. By contrast, digital currencies, in the grand sweep of economic history, have existed for about five minutes. That\u2019s no basis on which to make inflation-protection claims.\nOf course, buyers of bitcoins and other crypto currencies may believe they are protecting themselves against the profligacy of central banks. But a motive for buying doesn\u2019t mean the asset has suddenly acquired the characteristics fondly imagined. How, for example, would \u201cdigital gold\u201d proponents explain the near-50% plunge in bitcoin\u2019s value between May and July this year? That investors were universally relaxed about inflation in those months? Come on, we know that wasn\u2019t the case.\nThe unsatisfactory, but surely accurate, explanations for the latest burst of enthusiasm for bitcoin and its imitators seem simple. Appetite for pure speculation is alive and kicking; punting on crypto has become easier via innovations such as the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US; and serious marketing budgets are promoting crypto trading.\nInflation-related theories may make the exercise feel high-minded, or even mainstream, but they have very little to do with it.\nThe UK has left the European Union, so it is reasonable for the Treasury to want to unpick a few EU financial regulations. Not every piece of legislation that was created in Brussels was well designed. It is easy to see that the UK, as Europe\u2019s leading financial centre (still), might wish to do a few things differently.\nIt\u2019s just that chancellor, Rishi Sunak\u2019s, language around this ambition does not inspire confidence. \u201cToday\u2019s proposals will support the future strength of the UK as a global financial centre, ensuring an agile and dynamic approach to regulation that supports the growth of the UK economy, without diverging from our continued commitment to high international standards,\u201d said Tuesday\u2019s high-level statement.\nThe worrying words in that sermon are \u201cagile and dynamic\u201d. Wasn\u2019t roughly the same claim made about the \u201clight touch\u201d era of the 1990s that tolerated undercapitalised banks and timid regulators and culminated in the financial crash of 2007-09?\nThe nod to \u201chigh international standards\u201d is intended to counter that objection, but let\u2019s see. Agile regulators are great until they are bent out of shape by the people they are meant to be regulating.",

        "content": "Emma Hayes praised \u201cspecial\u201d Maren Mjelde after the right-back made her long-awaited return to action during Chelsea\u2019s thumping 7-0 defeat of Swiss side Servette in the Women\u2019s Champions League.\nMjelde entered the fray in the 66th minute with Chelsea already seven up, making her first appearance for Chelsea since suffering an ACL injury in March during the League Cup final. The win means Chelsea are top of Group A after Wolfsburg\u2019s trip to Juventus ended in a 2-2 draw.\n\u201cThe work she\u2019s done, and what the medical team and technical team have done with her \u2013 the effort that\u2019s been put in, it was an emotional moment for her. She\u2019s a Rolls-Royce of a footballer,\u201d said Hayes.\nThe head coach of the Swiss champions, \u00c9ric S\u00e9v\u00e9rac, had described facing Chelsea as going \u201cup against a mountain\u201d but the reality was even worse. The Servette players were not only held back by their own limitations; this mountain delivered landslide after landslide to make the task greater and greater with every step.\nChelsea were ruthless, relentless and delivered a performance that both stunned the more than 12,000 fans that had descended on the Stade de Gen\u00e8ve and left them purring at the elite talent on show.\nIt was not as straightforward as it looked though, according to player of the match Sam Kerr, who scored twice. \u201cIt was hard work, even if we made it look a bit easy,\u201d she said. \u201cGoals don\u2019t come easy but it was a real team effort, which is the nicest thing.\u201d\nThe Servette players are semi-professional and train in the evenings. There can be little shame in suffering such an emphatic defeat to a team that has been helping to drive standards across Europe in recent years and reached last season\u2019s final.\nS\u00e9v\u00e9rac had hoped his team would hold Chelsea at bay for at least some time. \u201cChelsea are one of the best teams in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to try to hold on as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWolfsburg are two points behind Chelsea in Group A after Cristiana Girelli's injury-time strike earned Juventus a 2-2 draw at the Allianz Stadium. The forward (pictured) found space in a crowded penalty area to sweep home Andrea Staskova's pass, moments after Wolfsburg defender Felicitas Rauch had been shown a second yellow card.\nGirelli had fired Juve ahead with a low finish across goal in the 22nd minute, only for Lena Lattwein to quickly equalise with a fine strike from 20 yards. Tabea Wa\u00dfmuth converted Turid Knaak's cross to score what looked like the winner after 65 minutes \u2013 but as they did in their 3-3 draw at Chelsea, Wolfsburg conceded a costly late leveller.\n\nParis Saint-Germain took control of Group B with a 4-0 rout of Real Madrid. The hosts were dominant at Parc des Princes and went ahead in the 13th minute when Marie-Antoinette Katoto rounded M\u00e9line G\u00e9rard to score from Grace Geyoro's precise through ball. Sara D\u00e4britz made it two just before half-time, getting the final touch after a goalmouth scramble.\nKatoto headed home her second 10 minutes into the second half before Roc\u00edo G\u00e1lvez's own goal completed the scoring. PSG have won all three group games so far, scoring 11 and conceding none. In Group B's other games, Ukraine's Zhytlobud-1 and Icelandic side Breidablik drew 0-0.\nWithin three minutes they had their first warning, a slip at the base of the mountain, as a cutback to Fran Kirby was parried by goalkeeper In\u00eas Pereira straight back into the path of the England international only for Kirby to hammer the rebound against the bar. Five minutes later and German international Melanie Leupolz sent a thundering left-footed strike in at the far post. Then the mountain crumbled beneath Swiss feet.\nWithin the space of eight minutes Chelsea scored four. First Kerr flicked Drew Spence\u2019s pass to the feet of Kirby who slotted in, then Leupolz knocked down Guro Reiten\u2019s cross for Kerr who side-footed in from close range. For the fourth goal, Kirby sent a ball in from the left which Kerr took down and prodded past Pereira, then Kerr sprung the offside trap and squared to Kirby to tap home.\nThe sixth was added seven minutes before the break, with the Olympic gold medallist, Jessie Fleming, squeezing the ball between the keeper and post from a tight angle.\nAfter the break the visiting team picked up where they left off as Kirby left Kerr\u2019s cross from the right for incoming Reiten to power in.\nIt can be difficult to watch teams be beaten so comprehensively, round after round. However, with the new group stage ensuring all 16 teams competing take away \u20ac400,000 (compared to the \u20ac80,000 they collected at the same stage, a single tie played over two legs, last season) \u2013 and solidarity payments going to teams in the domestic leagues of those teams competing at this stage \u2013 there is a real financial boost to just being a part of the show. That can have a real impact on the development of the sport.",

        "content": "Emma Raducanu has confirmed that Torben Beltz, the former long-time coach of Angelique Kerber, will be her new coach as she prepares for her first full season on tour in 2022. Raducanu also laughed off comments from Eddie Jones, the England rugby head coach, who claimed that she was distracted from her sport by photoshoots and wearing Christian Dior clothes.\nSpeaking shortly after her tight three-set loss to Wang Xinyu at the Upper Austria Ladies Linz, Raducanu responded to the first question about her coaching situation with a smile. \u201cBingo, you guys cracked it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a great privilege to be working with such an experienced coach. I\u2019m definitely very excited to work with him throughout the pre-season and into next year. Things are looking up and very positive, excited about the work that is to come.\u201d\nA day after Jones\u2019s comments about Raducanu led to criticism from prominent figures including Gabby Logan and Jo Durie, the British No 1 had little to say on the subject. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure who or what that means,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t followed any of the news. I stay away from that. So I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know what this is about.\u201d Raducanu, notably, was grinning widely as she delivered her response.\nThe 18-year-old has been looking for a new full-time coach since she decided not to extend her temporary partnership with Andrew Richardson following September\u2019s US Open triumph and she has held a number of coaching trials at her home base of Bromley Tennis Centre.\nDetails of the trial with Beltz were first reported by the Telegraph, which found a picture of Raducanu in a cafe near her home in Orpington with Beltz and her agent, Christopher Helliar, posted by a Raducanu fan account on Instagram. On Monday, Kerber announced she had parted ways with Beltz.\nRaducanu will join her new coach in the off-season as she prepares for the 2022 campaign, which will be her first full year on the tour. She cited his experience and success with Kerber as a key part of his sway.\n\u201cI think that experience definitely helps with someone as inexperienced as me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can help guide me through, which I feel really confident about. Also, he\u2019s a really positive, cheerful guy who brings great energy to the team so I think that\u2019s also important when you\u2019re travelling on the road for quite a long time on the tour.\u201d\nBeltz, 44, is a well known figure on the WTA tour, a former US college player who briefly competed at ATP Futures events before injuring his shoulder and switching to coaching. He has enjoyed tremendous success with Kerber, 33, a supreme athlete and hard worker who has established herself as arguably the most successful player of her age group with three grand slam titles, an Olympic silver medal and a considerable period spent as the world No 1.\nThe pair first worked together when Kerber was 16 years old and he oversaw her first rise into the top 10. During their second stint together, she won the Australian Open, the US Open and reached No 1 in 2016. After returning for a third stint with Kerber last year, their partnership culminated in a surprise revival in the second half of this year as she returned to the top 10 earlier this month. Additionally, Beltz spent three years working with Croatia\u2019s Donna Vekic from 2017. Their partnership was also successful, with Vekic rising from outside the top 50 into the top 20 during their time together, although it ended awkwardly last year.\nAround the tour, Beltz is known for his positivity and a gentle, good-natured approach that has been evident during his on-court coaching interactions with his charges. His high work rate has also spearheaded the success he has enjoyed in the sport and he provides the experience Raducanu is seeking.\nAs Raducanu finished her last WTA press conference of 2021, she offered her final thoughts on being the subject of public comments from prominent figures. \u201cI think that many people are going to have opinions of me and what I am doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just know that I\u2019m staying focused with a small circle around me and I definitely have my parents who would 100% let me know if I was getting swayed. So I think I\u2019m very zoned in.\u201d",

Since he took over as England\u2019s head coach, Jones has enjoyed a 100% winning record against his compatriots and is seeking an eighth straight win this weekend.\nWhite\u2019s side lost in a dramatic meeting with Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday. He believes that now Dave Rennie has replaced Jones\u2019s former Randwick teammate Michael Cheika as the Wallabies head coach, the buildup to this week\u2019s match is \u201cless personal\u201d, however, which will allow Australia to avoid some unwanted distractions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice for me to give us some praise but Eddie is the king of mind games so I\u2019m certainly not reading into too much of what he says,\u201d White said. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of guy you\u2019d love to sit down with a beer and talk rugby and hopefully one day I\u2019ll get that chance.\n\u201cBut he\u2019s the king of English rugby, with the media stuff, I love listening to it but our job is to focus on the things we could have controlled on the weekend and focus on us rather than previous times against England, focusing on what they do. I think it\u2019ll be less personal, for sure. Not that as a playing group, or I certainly didn\u2019t feel it but there was a lot in the media between Eddie and Cheik and I think it\u2019ll be a little bit different this week. It\u2019s a chance for us to focus on what we want to do and how we want to play.\u201d\nWhite, who came off the bench when the two sides last met in England\u2019s 40-16 World Cup quarter-final win in 2019, added: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the edge has gone, not at all.

        "content": "Asia Pacific Investment Development and its subcontractor have also allegedly failed to rehabilitate land affected by bauxite mining\nA mining operation in Solomon Islands owes millions in unpaid taxes and royalties, according to a former senior government figure, with a report showing that the mining companies had not paid taxes or royalties on one-third of their exports over the last five years.\nAccording to a summary of a royalty payments report into mining on West Rennell Island from the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, seen by the Guardian, the Asia Pacific Investment Development (APID) company and its subcontractor Bintan Mining Solomon Islands Ltd (BMSI) have paid royalties for only 67 of the 100 shipments of bauxite ore exported during their operation.\nThe report\u2019s executive summary noted that APID and BMSI had been exporting bauxite ore, which is used in the production of aluminium, from West Rennell since 2015. In that time, 100 shipments of bauxite have been exported overseas.\n\u201cWith regards to the royalty share payments, only sixty-seven (67) shipments have been paid to the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI). The remaining 33 shipments were still outstanding and yet to be paid to the CBSI before it can be distributed to the rightful recipients,\u201d said the report summary.\nFormer director of mines, Nicholas Biliki, estimates the unpaid ore shipments leave roughly SBD80m (AU$13.4m) owing to landowners on Rennell Island, for royalties, community development assistance and landowner payments, as well as around SBD10m (AU$1.65m) owed in taxes and roughly SBD10m owed in payments to rehabilitate the island.\nBiliki said the alleged failure to pay royalties on one-third of the shipments was a massive loss to Solomon Islands government and resources owners.\n\u201cAPID and its sub-contractor, BMC, [the parent company of BMSI] miserably failed to live up to their obligations. The company [APID] has lots of agreements with the landowners and lots of money has been owed to them. Also, the government has lost taxes from these 33 shipments,\u201d Biliki alleged.\nAs well as issues with missed payments, Biliki claimed that the companies had also failed to rehabilitate areas affected by mining.\n\u201cI understand more than a half of the areas mined have never been fully rehabilitated,\u201d he said.\nAPID and BMSI have been embroiled in court cases for years that contest which company is responsible for paying royalties and rehabilitating the environment.\nAPID\u2019s mining lease was cancelled in mid-October 2020 when Biliki was director of mines. APID has brought legal proceedings against the Solomon Islands government disputing this cancellation.\n\u201cThough we cancelled the operation, the company has a legal obligation to clean up its mess before leaving,\u201d he said.\nOne of the Rennell landowners, Jimmy Festus, said some resources owners were still waiting for their dues.\n\u201cOur waiting seemed to have no end \u2026 The sad reality we are currently facing is that we have no place for gardening,\u201d he said.\nAnother landowner, Steward Baiabe, told the Guardian that he had seen records of their bauxite shipments at the ministry of mines.\n\u201cI was in Honiara last month following up with the company for our shipments. Unfortunately, they have no offices in Honiara, so I went to the ministry of mines to enquire about the shipments. I was told by a mines officer that we have 33 shipments yet to be paid to the government and landowners.\u201d\nBaiabe called on the government to get the company to pay what they are alleged to owe.\n\u201cThe government must be serious on addressing this issue.\u201d\nIn response to questions put to BMSI by the Guardian, a lawyer representing the company said: \u201cWe are unable to comment \u2026 due to pending proceedings before the high court of Solomon Islands. The most we can say is that the informations and allegations supplied may not be accurate and may contain misleading or misstated informations.\u201d\nThe lawyer did respond to requests by the Guardian to clarify which information or allegations he was referring to.\nChris Vehe, permanent secretary of the ministry of mines, energy and rural electrification, confirmed there were inconsistencies in the money received for this mining operation and the number of shipments that took place.\n\u201cThere are inconsistencies with reporting and a good number of shipments have not been kept track [of]. Mines officials were the ones responsible for record keeping and tracking of the shipments. Only the director of mines like Mr Biliki and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands would definitely know of the details of the shipments. But yes, my office is aware of these inconsistencies.\u201d\nVehe said the government would investigate the matter if they were to get hold of all the records of shipments, adding that the operation was a complicated one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been messed up from its very beginning.\u201d\nThe governor of Solomon Islands\u2019 central bank has previously said that while exempt from paying export taxes, Bintan Mining Company have made some payments to the government, contributing SBD$142m (US$17.8m) in foreign exchange in 2020 and $131m (US$16.4m) in 2019. The governor did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\nBauxite mining on Rennell Island has been controversial since it first began, with landowners and some officials estimating that since 2014 up to 50% of the bauxite-rich soil in West Rennell has been exported.\nIn February 2019, Rennell Island was the site of a huge oil spill when a bulk carrier, hired by BMSI, that had been attempting to load bauxite from a nearby mine on the island ran aground on a reef. It spilled 300 tonnes of oil into the pristine bay.\nThe oil spill turned the water black, contaminated fresh water sources, killed marine life, and children reported skin and eye infections in the wake of the disaster.\nThe owner of the vessel, King Trader, and its South Korean insurer, P&I Club, apologised for the spill in March 2019, describing the situation as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. In a statement the companies said \u201calthough matters of liability are yet to be determined \u2026 [we] have expressed deep remorse\u201d. The statement said they were \u201cacutely aware of environmental damage\u201d and were working as quickly as possible to bring the spill under control.\nAccording to a report given to the Solomon Islands government in 2019 and leaked to the ABC, the oil spill caused the direct loss of more than 10,000 square metres of reef and more than 4,000 square metres of lagoon habitat, and economic losses of up to AU$50m. The report said the site could take up to 130 years to recover.\nAPID did not respond to questions put to them by the Guardian.",

It wants to appoint its own special counsel, paid for by the commonwealth, to examine the material on behalf of Collaery.\nCollaery\u2019s barrister, Christopher Ward, SC, criticised the move as a \u201ccarte-blanche\u201d attempt to reopen the case by leading fresh evidence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s described gently as being updated evidence, but it\u2019s fresh evidence, your honour,\u201d he said.\nThe process that the commonwealth want to take to get the new evidence before the court would take months and may trigger another appeal, extending the timetable further.\nJustice David Mossop questioned whether there would ever be an end to the case, if the attorney general wanted to continually produce new evidence updating the court on new developments in national security.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cIs there any prospect of this matter ever being completed? Or will we be stuck in a perpetual vortex of updating?\u201d he said.\nOutside court, Collaery slammed the move, saying he was wholly opposed to the commonwealth relying on new \u201csuper-secret evidence\u201d that was kept from him and his lawyers.\n\u201cThis takes the commonwealth\u2019s hypocritical obsession with secrecy to new heights when one considers recent events,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI strongly object to the court being given and relying on evidence we can\u2019t see. It\u2019s a shameful mockery of open justice.\u201d\nThe commonwealth will now make an application to reopen the case and lead the new evidence.\nHuman Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said secret evidence, which is kept from the person on trial, has \u201cno place in our legal system\u201d.\n\u201cThe court of appeal warned that secret trials undermine public confidence in the court system and enable political prosecutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attorney general is now seeking to provide secret evidence to the ACT supreme court, to insist that the trial should be held in secret, despite the court of appeal\u2019s judgment saying otherwise.\u201d\nCollaery is charged over his alleged role in disclosing information about an intelligence operation targeting Timor-Leste, an impoverished ally, during oil and gas negotiations in 2004.\nHe and his client, former intelligence officer Witness K, helped Timor-Leste take a case against Australia to the international courts, where they argued it had negotiated in bad faith due to the spying. It eventually struck a fairer deal with Australia over the oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea.",

But it began with a troll,\u201d Harry said. He did not elaborate.\nHarry made the comments while speaking on a panel called the Internet Lie Machine, organised by US magazine Wired, at which he said he told Twitter boss Jack Dorsey the day before the Capitol riots on 6 January that \u201chis platform was allowing a coup to be staged\u201d.\n\u201cThat email was sent the day before and then it happened and I haven\u2019t heard from him since,\u201d Harry said.\nHarry and Meghan, formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, moved to California last year to lead a more independent life.

Holmes offered an explanation that a rare form of breast cancer could be behind the irregular results \u2013 an excuse Das said he said \u201cseemed implausible\u201d.\n\u201cI found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s proprietary Edison devices.\nDas joined Theranos in 2016 amid mounting concerns about the company\u2019s products, taking over as its third lab director in several years. He testified that initially his \u201csole responsibility\u201d at the company was responding to a lengthy report from health regulators that found significant deficiencies in its labs.\nThat audit, conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, found that Theranos was not in compliance with standards for lab certification and that the company lacked a process for correcting quality control issues, according to evidence presented in court on Tuesday.\nDas testified that based on his findings he encouraged Holmes to void tests from the Edison devices conducted in 2014 and 2015, concluding: \u201cThese instruments were not performing from the very beginning.\u201d\nHolmes agreed to void 50,000 tests but pushed back against critiques of the devices themselves, arguing the faulty results were due to quality-control lab failures rather than inaccurate machines.\nLawyers for Holmes had fought to keep the damning report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services out of evidence but were overruled. The 121-page report came after a November 2015 audit and concluded the test deficiencies presented \u201ca threat to patient health and safety\u201d.\nUnder cross-examination by lawyers for Holmes, Das testified Theranos was working \u201cin good faith\u201d to improve the lab practices and that Holmes was supportive of those efforts. His testimony will continue in court on Wednesday.\nFederal prosecutors have continued in week 10 of the trial to present their case against Holmes, who faces a potential sentence of 20 years in prison.\nDas\u2019s court appearance comes after testimony from two other former lab directors as well as a number of other witnesses, including the former secretary of defense and early Theranos investor James Mattis, patients who received faulty tests, and other ex-Theranos employees.\nThe trial is expected to run into December.",

These so-called interconnectors across national borders are already here. On 1 October, a 720km (450-mile) undersea power cable went live between the UK and Norway, the world\u2019s longest subsea interconnector. This allows Norway to export surplus hydropower to the UK, but if water levels drop in the Norwegian hydro reservoirs during dry weather, the shortfall could be supplemented by wind generation from the UK. An even longer interconnector is proposed between the UK and Iceland, tapping into Iceland\u2019s huge supply of renewable hydro and geothermal energy. North Africa could also be plugged in \u2013 there is an ambitious proposal to link the UK to a projected giant solar scheme in Morocco.\n  With the climate of northern Europe rich in wind, and southern areas with plenty of sunshine, sharing a range of renewable energies across borders helps to even out fluctuations in weather, making power supplies more secure as well as clean.",

        "content": "Riders trying to get fuel from a leaking tanker were among 100 killed when it exploded. It\u2019s part of a bigger story of the struggle for survival in Sierra Leone, a country exploited by rich nations\nMore than 100 people were killed by an explosion in Freetown, Sierra Leone, last week, after a leaking fuel tanker collided with a lorry on a busy road in the capital city.\nMany of those who died were young motorbike taxi drivers, after dozens of riders rushed to the leaking tanker to collect free petrol and were caught in the blast. The tanker and lorry drivers tried to keep people away but could not stop the crowd. Half an hour later, it was too late.\nAbdul Bangura, 19, nicknamed Popa, had been working secretly as a motorbike rider, hiding the bike from his grandma, who he had lived with since he was a toddler. She had sponsored his education until she ran out of funds. After leaving school, Bangura had taken an informal apprenticeship with a local mechanic and was introduced to commercial transport. He knew his grandma worried, so he worked evenings without telling her until, after six months, he had saved up enough to enrol back in school.\nBut the demands of studying by day and working by night were too great, and he dropped out. On the evening of the explosion, Bangura had just started work when he came across the leaking fuel tanker and joined the crowd, hoping for some petrol. His grandma lay awake, worried about why he had not come home at the usual time. She discovered he had died in the explosion from his school friends the next day.\nThe informal transport business is one of the few options for young people like Bangura to make ends meet in Freetown. It is a dangerous job on poorly maintained and busy roads, which drivers are expected to navigate at speed. Accidents are commonplace. Police routinely exploit bike riders with fines or demands for bribes, in part to supplement their own low salaries. Hundreds of riders find themselves in the city\u2019s overcrowded, colonial-era prison for motoring offences, awaiting trials that are continually postponed. Fuel prices, which rocketed in the Covid pandemic, have not gone down despite public protests, and there are worries they will rise again. Customers are unwilling or unable to pay enough for the riders to make a profit.\nThe grim challenges Bangura and his fellow riders face are nothing new. Bike taxis were developed by former rebel soldiers in the early 2000s in the aftermath of the civil war, itself the result of a youth-led uprising against a coercive and neglectful state. The relationship between riders and the law continues to be tense. Riders say they are trying to make an honest living, but authorities label them dangerous, while officials take advantage of their precarious livelihoods, soliciting bribes.\nAnd the informal work plugs the gap in a city with little or no public transport. After a decade of civil war, and the impact of Ebola and Covid-19, Sierra Leone is yet to see a genuine recovery, and young people like Bangura are forced to look to the streets to make a living.\nGovernment officials and police are not the only ones to blame however. The state simply lacks the funds to maintain its institutions.\nCorruption among the political elites has exacerbated the country\u2019s economic situation, but so has decades of international pressure to \u201cliberalise\u201d the economy by cutting trade tariffs and reducing state expenditure.\nIt was these policies that caused so many industries, and employers, to fail since the 1980s, while far away, richer countries benefited by extracting the country\u2019s raw materials, such as bauxite and diamonds. Living off the land became untenable because so much was seized by international mining companies and commercial farms.\nAs three days of national mourning, which began on Monday, come to a close, we must remember this is not an isolated incident or freak accident. It is one more chapter in a long story that could have been different. Scores of young bike riders lost their lives, and many others were burned and maimed as a consequence of rising fuel and food costs and the pressures on informal workers from those in charge.\nThe risk of death has become the price demanded for seeking a living in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.\nJames B Palmer is an activist in the Sierra Leone Commercial Motor Bike Riders\u2019 Union\nDr Jonah Lipton is a research fellow at the Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa at the London School of Economics who has written a book about life in Freetown during Ebola",

Tell us in the comments below\nWhen the Age\u2019s art critic Robert Nelson reviewed a one-day art project in Melbourne on the weekend he noted the audience was looking at an installation by a UK conceptual artist in \u201cpuzzlement\u201d.\n\u201cYou could sense that viewers were searching in themselves for an explanation,\u201d Nelson wrote in his review of Jeremy Deller\u2019s work, Father and Son, which featured lifesize grey candles in the form of a seated old man and a younger man slowly burning to a puddle throughout the day.\nBut it was the art critic himself who was puzzled. Nelson wrote several hundred words about the meaning of the Turner prize-winning artist\u2019s work without realising the father and son effigies were of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch.\nOf course, we\u2019ve all made mistakes but rarely are they as public as the one published in the Age in print and online on Sunday. Remarkably, no one behind the scenes questioned why the writer had not mentioned the Murdochs in his piece, even though the likeness in the multiple pictures published was readily apparent.\nNo one appears to have noticed other news reports about the exhibition, including Guardian Australia\u2019s Melting moguls: life-size Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch candles burn in Melbourne installation, on Saturday.\nA spokesperson for Nine, publisher of the Age, declined to comment.\nTo his credit, Nelson wrote a mea culpa of sorts on Tuesday: \u201cSometimes the eyes aren\u2019t enough \u2026 I just didn\u2019t realise that the two antiquated specimens were the Murdochs.\u201d\nIn the \u201cspooky installation in a deconsecrated church in Collingwood\u201d Nelson saw, in Sunday\u2019s review, the Father and the Son of the Bible \u2013 not the father and son of the Murdoch media empire.\n\u201cEverything about this grand painting was foodie - right down to the table setting - but I didn\u2019t realise that the figures represented actual people from the Gospels. It puts a different spin on the work, for sure\u2026\u201d https://t.co/6T1XrjzNv1 pic.twitter.com/JClLeb1T4V\n\u201cEverything about the installation at St Saviour\u2019s Church of Exiles, Collingwood, was churchy \u2013 right down to the quotation from John\u2019s Gospel, where Jesus declares his deference to his Heavenly Father,\u201d Nelson wrote on Tuesday.\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t realise that the figures represented Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the media princes whose various dealings don\u2019t automatically strike you as theologically motivated.\n\u201cIt puts a different spin on the work, for sure; and if you were really focused on the detail of the Murdoch mannequins being incinerated, the concept would come close to farce.\u201d\nPriceless: \"I just didn\u2019t realise that the two antiquated specimens were the Murdochs.\" pic.twitter.com/gGOXhvWutd\nNelson had an \u201cout\u201d but admirably chose not to take it. Some readers thought his original review involved a \u201cconscious decision\u201d to suppress the Murdoch name.\n\u201cA witty Jane Scott, director of Horsham Art Gallery, was kind enough to write: \u2018Brilliant review \u2026 without actually mentioning the unmentionable\u2019,\u201d Nelson said.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to bask in the glow of this subtle gamesmanship; but in all candour, I just didn\u2019t realise the two antiquated specimens were the Murdochs.\u201d\nI argued it was more interesting to own the oversight rather than move on and pretend it never happened. I\u2019m glad I did, this is a terrific and brave piece by Robert. https://t.co/030IHptnfN\nHe also admitted there were clues as he walked around the art gallery that he chose to ignore because he believes in \u201ctrusting my eyes\u201d.\n\u201cMy ears heard somebody talking about \u2018Lachlan\u2019 but the whisper didn\u2019t really penetrate my critical visual armour,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I suppressed the connection, it was all in my unconscious. It would have been nice to own the virtue of resisting more Murdoch posterity; but the truth is that I didn\u2019t listen to my ears.\u201d\nBut ultimately Nelson transcends what he calls the \u201cembarrassment\u201d and argues that the fact that he missed the context is negligible.\n\u201cThe original interpretation along the scriptural lines \u2013 that the artist himself suggested \u2013 remains sound,\u201d he wrote on Tuesday. \u201cThe additional fact can contribute an additional layer of interpretation, but that doesn\u2019t make it a necessary layer of interpretation.\u201d\nTell us in the comments below something you\u2019ve got spectacularly wrong.",

But it needs more than taking note. It needs a lot of action and it\u2019s urgent,\u201d he said.\nA 2016 study found two-thirds of the global population, four billion people, faced water shortages, and many were at increased risk of floods and droughts brought on by the climate crisis.\n\u201cThe climate crisis is a water crisis at its core,\u201d he said. Rainfall patterns have changed in many parts of the world; \u201cmore intense and more frequent floods pollute water sources and destroy crops or homes, while longer and more frequent droughts dry up the springs many people need to survive.\u201d\nWainwright said very little action was being taken to help affected communities. A WaterAid analysis in 2020 found that water received less than 3% of climate finance overall.\nRising sea levels were introducing salt into water sources in places, and drought was pushing water deep underground in others, he said, forcing people, mostly women, to spend longer and walk further in search of water.\n\u201cWater is fundamental to life,\u201d said Wainwright. \u201cIt underlies your health, your ability to have an education.\u201d\nHe pointed out that it was the poorest people in countries that had contributed the least to the climate crisis who were suffering the most and said investment in managing water supply should be focused in these areas.\nThe overwhelming focus of talks on addressing the climate crisis had been on trying to slow it down, he said, at the expense of highlighting the current impact on some of the most climate-stressed parts of the world.\n\u201cWe need a revolution that takes us to zero carbon and we need a revolution that takes us to adapting the world to cope with the climate change that is irreversible,\u201d he said.\nAs part of efforts to tackle the problem, a coalition of governments, businesses, banks and non-governmental organisations pledged their support on Friday for a water and climate crisis fund that aims to bring clean water to 50 million people in Africa and Asia by 2030.\nUnless action was taken, the future would not be \u201cnot worth thinking about\u201d, Wainwright added. \u201cIt\u2019s calamitous. [A lack of access to water] is already killing people \u2026 It\u2019s unthinkable not to do something about this. The world has to rise to this challenge.\u201d",

        "content": "Former Australian prime minister also says Britain \u2018like an old theme park sliding into the Atlantic\u2019 compared to modern China\nThe former Australian prime minister Paul Keating has denounced the US- and UK-backed plan for nuclear-powered submarines as \u201clike throwing a handful of toothpicks at the mountain\u201d, declaring Australia should avoid being drawn into a war with China.\nThe former Labor leader on Wednesday accused the major Australian political parties of losing their way on foreign policy, while dismissing the credibility of the UK\u2019s \u201ctilt\u201d to the Indo-Pacific region.\n\u201cBritain is like an old theme park sliding into the Atlantic compared to modern China,\u201d said Keating, who was Australia\u2019s prime minister from 1991 to 1996.\nKeating also played down criticism of China\u2019s militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea by saying \u201cbig powers are rude\u201d, and said it would be wrong to insist the increasingly dominant economic power could be only \u201ca stakeholder\u201d in a US-led system.\nWhile he said Beijing was \u201cin the adolescent phase of their diplomacy\u201d and had \u201ctestosterone running everywhere\u201d, Australia had no alternative but to engage with an increasingly powerful China.\nKeating was most critical of Australia\u2019s plan to work with the US and the UK to acquire at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines, as part of the Aukus partnership, with the first of them unlikely to be in the water until about 2040.\nHe said Scott Morrison\u2019s Coalition government was wrongly \u201ctrying to find our security from Asia rather than in Asia\u201d.\nThe plan was all about hawkish national security advisers who \u201ccan\u2019t wait to get the staplers back on to the Americans\u201d, he said, adding that the submarines would not have a decisive military impact against China.\n\u201cEight submarines against China when we get the submarines in 20 years\u2019 time \u2013 it\u2019ll be like throwing a handful of toothpicks at the mountain,\u201d he told the National Press Club.\nKeating said the Australian government had treated the French government \u201cappallingly\u201d over the cancellation of the $90bn deal for 12 conventionally powered submarines.\nHe also questioned whether the plans would diminish Australia\u2019s strategic autonomy \u2013 a concern also raised by the Labor opposition. The former prime minister said if Australia were to buy American Virginia class submarines, \u201cthey\u2019ll simply be part of the United States force directed by the United States\u201d.\nLast month, on an unofficial visit to Taipei, the conservative former prime minister Tony Abbott raised fears Beijing \u201ccould lash out disastrously very soon\u201d at Taiwan \u2013 and argued the US and Australia could not stand idly by.\nKeating said China \u201cwants its front doorstep and front porch\u201d \u2013 including Taiwan \u2013 but he did not believe China would launch military action unless leaders in Taipei formally declared independence.\nHe cited a recent speech by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that Beijing would try to resolve the matter harmoniously.\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that will one day be \u201creunified\u201d \u2013 by force if necessary \u2013 although the Chinese Communist party has never ruled the island.\nChina flew 150 warplanes into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone in the space of four days at the beginning of October, increasing pressure on the democratically governed island of 24 million people.\nKeating said Australia \u201cshould not be drawn into a military engagement over Taiwan, US sponsored or otherwise\u201d because Taiwan was \u201cnot a vital Australian interest\u201d.\nKeating argued the foreign policy debate in Australia was now driven by \u201cthe spooks\u201d in the security agencies, and when it came to the major foreign policy choices the Coalition and Labor were \u201cfundamentally not up to it\u201d.\nHe said the party he once led should not have been so quick to support the government\u2019s submarine decision; it should have used the cover of the agreed 18-month study period to consider the right choice for Australia.\n\u201cInstead of that, Labor gets a briefing one night, and by 11 o\u2019clock the next morning, they\u2019re in the car,\u201d he said.\nHe said Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, had opted for a \u201creasonably quiet political life\u201d by effectively taking the position that \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be an ounce of daylight between her and the Liberal party\u201d on foreign policy.\n\u201cYou have no big disputes, because you\u2019re glued up on to the government, but you make no national progress,\u201d he said.\nWong, who has previously backed the argument for nuclear-powered submarines but criticised the Morrison government\u2019s handling of the announcement, declined to comment. Morrison\u2019s office also declined to respond to Keating\u2019s remarks.\nAustralia\u2019s relationship with China, its top trading partner, has deteriorated in recent years, including over the blocking of Chinese telco Huawei from Australia\u2019s 5G network, increasing scrutiny of foreign investment proposals, criticism of China over human rights, and the government\u2019s early calls for a Covid-19 origins inquiry.\nThat worsened last year when China began blocking calls with Australian government ministers and rolled out trade actions against a range of Australian exports including coal, wine, barley and seafood. Morrison has said he won\u2019t trade away Australia\u2019s sovereignty or values.\nKeating argued Australia could have a \u201ccivil relationship\u201d with China even though they may disagree on a range of issues. He said Canberra should always reserve the right to speak out on human rights \u2013 including in Xinjiang in China\u2019s west \u2013 but said it should also speak out about India\u2019s treatment of Muslims in Kashmir.\nKeating agreed China had become \u201cmore authoritarian\u201d, but argued \u201cit will become a more civil society than the United States\u201d, citing America\u2019s problems with school shootings and Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\nHe said China did \u201cnot want to command three oceans, like the United States\u201d but was \u201cinterested in the corner of one ocean, its ocean\u201d.\nLiberal party senator James Paterson, who chairs the Australian parliament\u2019s security and intelligence committee, branded Keating\u2019s assessment as \u201cout of date\u201d.\n\u201cThe people of Taiwan can take comfort from the fact that not only does Paul Keating not speak for the government, he does not even reflect the views of the Labor party he once led,\u201d Paterson said on Wednesday night.\n\u201cHis views on China are out of date and out of touch.\u201d",

        "content": "Zoological Society of London carries out most comprehensive survey since 1950s\nSeahorses, eels, seals and sharks are living in the tidal Thames, according to the most comprehensive analysis of the waterway since it was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.\nBut scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), who carried out the work, warn that the 95 miles of the tidal Thames is suffering from rising nitrate levels as a result of industrial runoff and sewage discharges. Water levels and temperature are also rising as a result of global heating.\nOn average, summer temperatures in the upper tidal Thames have been increasing by 0.19C a year since the turn of the century, the State of the Thames report said.\nThe scale of plastic pollution littering the tidal Thames, which stretches from below Teddington to Shoeburyness is also highlighted. As well as thousands of plastic bottles, wet wipes are a serious concern.\nOne mound of wet wipes in Barnes has grown in height by 1.4 metres since 2014 and covers an area of 1,000 sq metres.\n\u201cThese products, many of which contain plastic, are physically altering the foreshore along the Thames by creating large mounds of sediment densely bound together,\u201d said the report.\nThe density of microplastics found in the Thames was measured at 19.5 plastics per cubic metre, and microplastics flow down the river at a rate of up to 94,000 pieces per second, the report estimated.\nZSL used 17 different indicators to assess the health of the Thames\u2019s natural environment. It highlighted the impact of dedicated conservation efforts, such as the Salt Fleet Flats reserve near the mouth of the Thames on its southern bank. The mudflats and saltmarsh habitat was created in 2016 and is home to a range of wading birds.\nSpecies living in the Thames include seahorses and even sharks, including tope, starry smooth-hound and spurdog.\nThe most recent count revealed there were about 900 harbour seals and 3,200 grey seals. Since the surveys began in 2003, there has been a clear and steady increase in both seal populations in the Thames estuary.\nFish numbers have declined since the 1990s, though, with conservation scientists saying further research is needed to determine the cause.\nThe tidal Thames supports more than 115 species of fish, 92 species of bird and has almost 600 hectares of saltmarsh, which is a crucial habitat for a range of wildlife.\nZSL\u2019s conservation programme lead for wetland ecosystem recovery, Alison Debney, said: \u201cEstuaries are one of our neglected and threatened ecosystems. They provide us with clean water, protection from flooding, and are an important nursery for fish and other wildlife. The Thames estuary and its associated \u2018blue carbon\u2019 habitats are critically important in our fight to mitigate climate change and build a strong and resilient future for nature and people.\n\u201cThis report has enabled us to really look at how far the Thames has come on its journey to recovery since it was declared biologically dead, and in some cases, set baselines to build from in the future.\u201d\nWhile levels of dissolved oxygen and phosphorus have declined, the latter as a result of better treatment of sewage since the 1990s, scientists found a long-term increase in nitrate concentrations, which can negatively affect water quality and be damaging to wildlife.\nSources of the high levels of nitrates are industrial and sewage effluent discharging into the water, according to the Environment Agency.\nIn addition, there are many chemicals of concern that are not being regularly monitored, with potentially harmful impacts on the wildlife of the Thames.\nThe Thames Tideway tunnel, known as London\u2019s new super-sewer, which is due to be completed in 2025 at a cost of \u00a33.9bn, will capture more than 95% of the sewage spills that enter the river from sewer systems, according to the civil engineers behind the project.\nThe ZSL report also highlights recreational use of the river, from rowing to kayaking and fishing to tourist boats. \u201cAs a diverse environment, accessible to millions of people, the tidal Thames is an important source of cognitive benefits,\u201d the report said.",

Even so, the course Cousteau charted through 20th-century exploration, exploitation and, belatedly, environmentalism is still quite stunning: pioneering western freediver, the inventor of the aqualung in Toulon, discoverer of the oil reserves that enriched Abu Dhabi, swashbuckling film-maker who won the Palme d\u2019Or, and by the mid-1980s a de facto elder statesman whom governments could not afford to ignore on the emerging topic of climate change.\nDirector Liz Garbus largely constructs her film from archive recordings of Cousteau and associates, and journal entries voiced by Vincent Cassel. Possibly, sustained sit-down interviews with his three surviving children (his heir apparent Philippe was tragically killed in a plane crash in 1979) might have yielded even more probing insights into the family dynamics \u2013 and the questing personality at its centre everyone had to accommodate.\nBecoming Cousteau is no hagiography, but greater distance might have also allowed Garbus to reflect more on the man\u2019s environmental legacy. The film is keen to assert his involvement in the 1991 moratorium on Antarctic exploration. Kudos, for sure \u2013 but perhaps it\u2019s possible that such media paragons, among them David Attenborough after him, have also allowed politicians to claim green credentials by association, rather than action.\n Becoming Cousteau is released in cinemas on 12 November.",

It\u2019s where most of the carbon is taken up.\u201d\nThe amazing @SylviaEarle speaking at @TIME magazine event in Glasgow with @vanessanakawe @StellaMcCartney @algore and @JohnKerry at cop26 pic.twitter.com/TPGurniQFy\nThe exponential growth in industrial fishing is blamed for an alarming drop in marine life in the last half century. A third of commercial fish populations are being harvested at biologically unsustainable levels, according to a 2018 report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\u201cAll of that wildlife taken out of the ocean not only affects biodiversity and fosters extinctions at an accelerated rate. It breaks the carbon cycle \u2013 the nutrient chain that maintains the fabric of life on Earth,\u201d she said.\nThe pioneering marine biologist from New Jersey made history in 1970 with Mission 6, when she and an all-female team of scientists spent two weeks in Nasa\u2019s underwater laboratory in the US Virgin Islands, Tektite II, to study aquatic life as well as the psychology of a small crew in extreme conditions, as part of Nasa\u2019s research for sending humans to the moon.\nShe operated deep-sea research submarines in the 1980s and served as the first female chief scientist of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1998 Time Magazine named her its first Hero for the Planet.\n\u201cIt is frustrating to be able to see the future so clearly, from having spent years at sea, and thousands of hours under the sea, and to realise that so many people can\u2019t see it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe climate scientists are saying: \u2018Listen up, we\u2019ve got about 10 years, to make or break our behaviour toward nature.\u201d\nEarle noted that just five nations were \u201cbenefiting disproportionately on an industrial scale from the wild animals that live [in international waters]\u201d.\nChina and Taiwan account for 60% of distant-water fishing, while Japan, South Korea, and Spain make up about 10% each, according to a 2019 report by the Stimson Center.\n\u201cOnly a small segment of the human population truly relies on ocean life for sustenance,\u201d said Earle. \u201cMany more rely on it for money, using wild animals as a source of revenue.\u201d\nShe argued that the coastal communities who survived on fishing could do so within national waters, and compared fishing the high seas to killing elephants for ivory or rhinoceroses for their horns. Industrial fishing was \u201ccutting slashes in the web of life\u201d by destroying fish populations around the world, she said.\nWorldwide, 3 billion people rely on wild-caught or farmed seafood as their main source of animal protein, particularly in coastal communities and small-island states, according to the WWF.\nEarle is also president of Mission Blue, an organisation that aims to establish marine protected areas (MPA) around the world. She hailed last week\u2019s announcement at Cop26 of a new \u201cmega-MPA\u201d, linking the waters of Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica, but said the signatories of the \u201c30x30\u201d initiative \u2013 to secure at least 30% of the world\u2019s ocean as marine protected areas by 2030 \u2013 needed to step up.\n\u201cWe must protect nature as if our lives depend on it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cAchieving 30% of full protection for land and sea \u2026 doesn\u2019t mean we can trash the rest.\u201d\nShe said the Covid-19 pandemic had helped give people a greater appreciation of nature and realise that what affects one affects us all.\n\u201cWe are equipped with the superpower of knowing,\u201d said Earle. \u201cWe are one species with an oversized impact, an oversized responsibility and I\u2019d say an oversized opportunity to take what we now know and act.\u201d\nEarle, a vegetarian who says she has not eaten fish for at least four decades, called the ocean a \u201cliving system, a biogeochemical miracle, that keeps us safe in a universe that doesn\u2019t have a built-in life support system.\n\u201cWe have abused it, thinking that it\u2019s infinite in its capacity to recover \u2013 no matter what we put in, what we take out.\u201d",

        "content": "The Monsal Trail is a much-loved walking and cycling route, but pressure is building for trains to return, restoring a direct link between Derby and Manchester\nMeandering across spectacular viaducts bridging limestone cliffs that drop into the River Wye, the Monsal Trail is considered one of the most scenic walking and cycling routes in the UK.\nWith slopes covered in purple orchids and cowslips in May, and ox-eye daisies, bloody cranesbill and a lilac dusting of small scabious later in the year, the trail rewards walkers with stunning scenery across the Peak District.\nBut this haven for wildlife and geology, and attraction for rail heritage enthusiasts, is under threat. The route is at the centre of a battle between outdoor enthusiasts and those who would like to convert it back into a railway line.\nAfter the closure of the Peak and Dales line in 1968, nearly nine miles of the now- abandoned railway were transformed into a trail, incorporating railway tunnels as well as the Monsal viaduct. In 2011 the four Victorian tunnels on the trail were opened to create a complete off-road cycling route, funded as part of the wider Pedal Peak District project to promote cycling opportunities in the national park.\nBut now the Manchester and East Midlands Rail Action Partnership (Memrap) is calling for the reinstatement of the Peaks and Dales line. The group says it would \u201creconnect isolated communities between Matlock and Buxton/Chinley and reconnect Manchester with the east Midlands, to and through the Peak District national park\u201d.\nHowever, almost 14,000 people have signed a petition against the proposals. Lee Cooper-Smith, who started the petition and can often be seen walking the trail with his six-month-old daughter, said its loss would have a significant impact.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful, spectacular place that has the bonus of being incredibly accessible, which is unusual for somewhere so magnificent. It allows disabled people and those with young children in tow to access something wonderful really easily,\u201d said Cooper-Smith, who lives 18 miles from the route in the Derbyshire town of New Mills.\nFor Cooper-Smith, 48, a railway enthusiast who spent three months converting a dilapidated railway carriage into an office in his back garden last year, part of the fascination of the trail is its heritage as a former railway line, where walkers are able to retrace its fascinating history and the old industries along its route.\n\u201cThe utter joy of the trail is that you feel as if you are experiencing the engineering of yesteryear, and you get a glimpse into the industrial revolution with all the cotton mills. Walking through the tunnels is very exciting,\u201d he adds.\nThe trail is estimated to attract 300,000 visitors a year. In 2020, during the late summer period alone, it saw more than 200,000 visitors. At its peak, there were almost 2,000 visits a day.\nCooper-Smith said that because of the topography it was not possible to have rail and trail within the valley. \u201cIf rail wins, the trail will have to follow the B6465 road. This very action completely changes, and reduces, the unique appeal of the trail, of walking through the tunnels, along the same viaduct \u2013 it just becomes a trail. And this reduces the appeal ofa tourism asset that is partly responsible for the \u00a32.3bn Derbyshire\u2019s tourism trade, which many of our local businesses rely on.\u201d\nFor more than 100 years, the line, created by the Midland Railway by digging several tunnels and bridging the River Wye with the Monsal viaduct, carried passengers, freight and tourists to the fashionable spa town of Buxton.\nThe route linking Derby and Manchester was considered one of the most scenic in the country, carving its way through Derbyshire\u2019s great limestone hills, with several impressive feats of civil engineering to help it through the hilly terrain. But in 1968 the section between Matlock and Buxton was closed to save money. The Peak District national park authority reopened the route for recreation in 1981, with the trail cutting through limestone between Blackwell and Monsal Head.\nSupporters of the rail link argue that local communities lack access to wider transport links. Some politicians hail it as an ideal opportunity for \u201clevelling up\u201d, and a counter-petition created in 2015 to reopen the railway from Derby to Manchester has attracted more than 19,000 signatories.\nMemrap claims the reopened railway would provide sustainable public transport for the 13.25 million annual visitors to the Peak District national park \u2013 90% of whom have no other option than to arrive by car. They also claim research has found that the Derbyshire economy is suffering from a steady \u201cbleeding\u201d effect, due to the lack of proper connectivity between Derby and Manchester, along the corridor running south to north through the county.\nA spokesperson for the group said: \u201cThe campaign aims to correct this with our proposal for reinstating this railway, which once linked Derby and Manchester directly, with proper attention to and respect for the Monsal Trail and the national park through which it must once again pass. It would \u2013 this time \u2013 serve the national park better than it did previously.\u201d\nHigh Peak MP Robert Largan said the reinstatement of the line could be a great example of levelling up.\n\u201cRe-instating the railway to Bakewell, Matlock and beyond could potentially be a huge boost for Buxton. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sponsoring a bid for a feasibility study, so this possibility can be properly looked at,\u201d he said. \n  \u201cOf course, there are complications when it comes to the much loved Monsal Trail and I certainly wouldn\u2019t support the trail being closed. That\u2019s why the work that Buxton Town Team are doing to consider alternative trail provision is so important,\u201d he added.\nBut earlier this week the pro-railway campaign was dealt a blow when the Department for Transport ruled against offering it any funding. Memrap had put in for a slice of the \u00a3500m Restoring Your Railway programme, which was launched in January 2020 as part of the government\u2019s levelling-up agenda.\nDespite the setback, Memrap chief executive Stephen Chaytow vowed to continue pursuing the reopening of the railway. \u201cWhile we are naturally disappointed not to have secured the funding we were seeking through Restoring Your Railway, we continue to pursue other, existing avenues via the appropriate agencies,\u201d he said.\nLater this month, the Dartmoor Line, which successfully bid for government funding, will reopen almost 50 years after it was axed. The \u00a340.5m line is the first to be reinstated as part of the initiative.\nThis article was amended on 14 November, 2021 to include an updated comment from Robert Largan, MP.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe Series 7 version costs from \u00a3369 ($399/A$599) and, despite being \u00a310 cheaper than last year\u2019s Series 6, is Apple\u2019s most expensive smartwatch, above the Watch SE costing from \u00a3249 ($279/A$429). It requires an iPhone 6S or newer and does not work with Android.\nThe Series 7 comes in 41 or 45mm case sizes, both 1mm taller than their predecessors and thinner bezels mean the screens are 20% larger.\nEvery extra pixel on a device as small as a smartwatch counts. On-screen buttons are bigger and easier to tap. More text fits on the display or fonts can be made larger and easier to read. New watch faces can fit two full-size information widgets at once, and there\u2019s a new full qwerty keyboard for typing out messages that is exclusive to the Series 7.\nNone of these additions are revolutionary, but they are good refinements to the current Apple Watch formula.\nCase size: 41 or 45mm\nCase thickness: 10.7mm\nWeight: 32/38.8g, 42.3/51.5g or 37/45.1g depending on material and size\nProcessor: S7\nRAM: 1GB\nStorage: 32GB\nOperating system: WatchOS 8\nWater resistance: 50 metres (5ATM)\nSensors: gyro, HR, ECG, blood oxygen, microphone, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, wifi n, NFC, ultra wideband, optional 4G/eSIM\nThe new S7 chip matches the performance of last year\u2019s S6, making the Series 7 the fastest, smoothest and slickest smartwatch you can buy. Battery life is the same, too, lasting about 36 hours between charges with sleep tracking overnight and the screen on all of the time during the day. Tracking a 35-minute run consumed 7% of the battery, so it should manage a marathon or two.\nApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery in the Series 7. Batteries in similar devices typically last at least 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. The battery can be replaced for \u00a382.44. Repairs cost between \u00a3286.44 and \u00a3462.44 depending on the model, while repair specialists iFixit awarded the Series 7 a repairability score of 6 out of 10.\nThe Series 7 includes 100% recycled aluminium, 99% recycled tungsten and rare earth elements, and 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main chips. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch\u2019s environmental impact in its report.\nThe Series 7 runs the same watchOS 8 software as every Apple Watch from 2015\u2019s Series 3. It adds a portrait photo watch face, the \u201cfocus\u201d notification handlings from iOS 15 and the ability to set more than one timer at once.\nIt also adds better text entry including the ability to use combinations of dictation, scribble, emojis and a full qwerty keyboard. There is also a redesigned meditation app that melds breathing coaching with mindfulness.\nWatchOS 8 is the best supported and most capable smartwatch operating system available, despite recent advances by Google with WearOS. You can expect at least five years or longer of software support, including feature and security updates, which is far longer than smartwatch rivals.\nThe Series 7 has the same comprehensive health-tracking features as the Series 6, including the ability to take ECG for heart rhythm, blood oxygen level monitoring and fitness tracking across a large range of workout types. Only dedicated multisport watches track more metrics across running, cycling and adventure sports.\nSleep tracking now includes respiration rate, but not sleep cycles like some competitors.\nThe Apple Watch can be used to unlock an iPhone with Face ID when wearing a mask, which is extremely convenient.\nBands made for older Apple Watch models fit the Series 7.\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 comes in two sizes, three different materials and models with the option of 4G that requires an eSIM and compatible phone plan add-on.\nThe aluminium or Nike versions in 41mm size cost \u00a3369 ($399/A$599) or \u00a3399 ($429/A$649). 4G models cost an extra \u00a3100 ($100/A$150). Stainless steel and titanium models cost more.\nFor comparison, the Apple Watch SE costs \u00a3249, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 costs \u00a3249, the Fitbit Sense costs \u00a3279.99 and the Garmin Venu 2 costs \u00a3299.\nThere wasn\u2019t a lot wrong with last year\u2019s Series 6, so a bigger, better screen and faster charging add to an already winning experience.\nIt is still expensive, even if it is \u00a310 cheaper than last year, and the lack of third-party watch faces means you\u2019re stuck using only those that are built in. Sleep tracking could be better, too, but the rest of the health features are top-class.\nIt is not worth upgrading from a recent Apple Watch. But for those with worn-out models or looking for their first smartwatch for the iPhone, the Apple Watch Series 7 is the best you can buy.\nPros: excellent haptic vibrations, larger and better always-on screen, ECG, top health tracking, great activity tracking, 50m water resistance, solid battery, long software support, recycled aluminium.\nCons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, sleep tracking still not great, blood oxygen data not that useful, no third-party watch faces, not a giant upgrade.\nApple Watch SE review: an almost great cheaper option\nFitbit Sense review: a good smartwatch that fails on sustainability\nVenu 2 review: can Garmin make a good smartwatch?\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 4 review: Google smartwatch raises bar",

        "content": "Once reputed to be worth \u00a3100m, the \u2018Tory Obama\u2019 is facing bankruptcy proceedings over unpaid taxes\n\nWhen Adam Afriyie sold his political data business, DeHavilland, for \u00a318m, only months after his 2005 election to the House of Commons, it looked as if the fledgling MP had secured a strong financial platform to support his vaulting political ambition.\nHis 72% stake in the company netted him \u00a313m and one of the Conservative party\u2019s first black MPs \u2013 sometimes dubbed the \u201cTory Barack Obama\u201d \u2013 was at one stage reputed to be worth \u00a3100m.\nYet this week, HMRC submitted a petition to the high court to have him declared bankrupt over an unpaid bill for at least \u00a31.7m in taxes from his crumbling business empire. Companies House filings suggest that Afriyie\u2019s businesses collapsed owing a total of \u00a32.3m.\nAfriyie\u2019s position as an MP, in the safe Windsor constituency he has represented since his political debut, does not appear to be under imminent threat.\nBut parliamentary rules mean that he would have to stand aside if a bankruptcy restrictions order is made against him. These can be imposed if the bankrupt refuses to cooperate with the process or is suspected of hiding assets, for example.\nThe taxman\u2019s petition, which Afriyie apparently intends to defend at the high court in person, relates primarily to the liquidation of IT firm Connect Support Services, set up before DeHavilland, the venture whose sale proved so lucrative back in 2005.\nConnect Support Services went into insolvency in 2017 and was sold by administrators to fellow IT business Cloud Direct. The Guardian understands that Afriyie expects proceeds from the sale, between \u00a31.5m and \u00a32m, to clear the bulk of his debts to HMRC.\nThat sale took place in 2017. A liquidator\u2019s report filed at Companies House more than three years later, in November 2020, shows that the company owed \u00a31.8m to HMRC at that time.\nAnother Afriyie business is in the taxman\u2019s sights too. When Afriyie sold DeHavilland in 2005, he carved out and retained the company\u2019s fast-growing news agency, now called Axonn Media, but known back then as Adfero.\nThe company was something of a hothouse. Back in 2013, when Afriyie was under scrutiny due to rumours that he intended to challenge David Cameron for leadership of the Conservative party, one former employee lifted the lid on what he alleged was a punishing culture at Adfero.\nThe former employee, now a Guardian staff member, spoke of being told to produce up to 30 \u201cstories\u201d a day for publication, in an office above a branch of Subway, churning out words on subjects as diverse as double glazing, human resources, conservatories, holidays in Dubai and garden tools.\n\u201cThe job boiled down to scouring the internet for stories to rewrite such that they were tailored to a client and, most importantly, could include keywords that would boost search engine optimisation,\u201d he said.\nAround the same time, Adfero \u2013 which had derived its name from the Latin for \u201cI bring news\u201d \u2013 rebranded and became Axonn.\nDespite its new name, Axonn failed to adapt to the changing world of internet marketing and, from around 2014, began haemorrhaging customers and cutting staff.\nThe company went into liquidation in 2019 and was sold in July 2019 to T&D Media Group for \u00a339,000 and 6% of sales in the first year. By the time of the liquidator\u2019s next progress report, that 6% was worth just \u00a319,758.76. That indicates annual turnover of less than \u00a3330,000 at Axonn, compared with nearly \u00a37.6m in 2013.\nThat same liquidator\u2019s report, filed in September this year, shows that \u00a3492,000 was owed to HMRC.\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for Afriyie said: \u201cThe [bankruptcy] petition arises for complex reasons related to Adam\u2019s past business interests. Negotiations have been ongoing for several years and the petition is subject to legal challenge as his advisers are working towards reaching an agreement.\u201d\nThe spokesperson declined to offer further comment on Tuesday.",

It called on the special minister of state, Ben Morton, to explain how the bill would be effective and its impact on vulnerable groups.\nIf the voter integrity bill was passed, Australians would be asked to show photo or non-photo identification in order to vote.\nPeople unable to show ID could get another registered voter to vouch for them or cast a declaration vote \u2013 after providing their date of birth and signature \u2013 as a fallback.\nThe controversial bill was introduced in the October sittings of parliament, prompting fears it could be pushed through ahead of the 2022 election with the support of One Nation, which has claimed credit for it, and Centre Alliance, which has supported it in principle but is yet to decide its position.\nThe committee noted the bill could limit the right to participate in public affairs \u201cif a person is unable to cast a vote \u2026 or potentially if there is a lower voter turnout because of a perception that identification is required to vote\u201d.\nIt suggested the bill could also limit \u201cthe right to equality and non-discrimination\u201d as requiring proof of identity \u201cmay have a disproportionate impact on particular groups\u201d, including homeless people or Indigenous Australians in remote communities.\nThe committee said \u201cprotecting against voter fraud\u201d may be a legitimate objective, but the government had not explained \u201cwhy the current laws are insufficient \u2026 and why the measures address a pressing and substantial concern\u201d.\nThe Coalition majority on the joint standing committee on electoral matters has recommended voter ID in reviews of the 2013, 2016 and 2019 elections.\nBut the human rights committee noted the Australian Electoral Commission had found instances of voter fraud were \u201cvanishingly small\u201d.\nThe committee said that \u201cno evidence has been provided as to how the measure will protect against voter fraud, and therefore increase public confidence in the electoral system\u201d.\n\u201cIt is also not clear how voter identification requirements would be able to prevent people from voting multiple times at different locations.\u201d\nThe committee said it was \u201cnot clear if it may in fact reduce public confidence in the electoral system and discourage some voters from voting because of the perception that they cannot vote if they do not possess adequate identification documents\u201d.\nAlthough the committee praised safeguards including the declaration vote, it said it was \u201cunclear\u201d if this option would be accessible for all if further information such as a driver\u2019s licence or passport number was required.\nThe committee asked Morton to provide further information about why the bill is necessary, how it would be effective, whether any modelling on turnout has been conducted, its impact on vulnerable groups, and consideration of alternatives.\nNevertheless, the committee said it had \u201cnot yet formed a concluded view\u201d.\nWebster told Guardian Australia her personal view was the bill contained enough safeguards and she supported it because \u201cfraudulent behaviour should be stopped\u201d.\nLabor and the Greens, who have five members on the 10-member committee, both oppose the bill.\nThe University of Sydney\u2019s Prof Anne Twomey has warned the bill could be challenged in court as a disproportionate measure that excludes people from voting.",

        "content": "Cheap and cheerless sci-fi action thriller pits cunning prisoner Willis against wealthy hunters in dreary genre retread\nA mutant mashup of Squid Game, The Hunger Games and Suicide Squad, this cheap and cheerless sci-fi action film posits a future wherein wealthy hunters come to a remote island to pursue and kill human targets foolishly hoping for a big win if they survive.\nApex, the company that runs the show, is represented by a hologram hostess named West (Alexia Fast), who has a posh British accent as if it\u2019s the mid-1990s when that was still a signifier of evil. When one of Apex\u2019s most ruthless but regular customers, multi-trillionaire Rainsford (Neal McDonough), complains that the prey have become too easy, West brings in Malone (Bruce Willis), a prisoner so notorious for his cunning and ferocity he\u2019s been kept in solitary confinement for years. Despite this treatment, Malone seems none too distressed by those years of isolation. Indeed, he seems just as chipper and quippy as Willis always seems in crappy movies like this; moreover he is apparently quite content to spend a lot of time on his own creeping around the island forest, oddly almost never in the same shot as any of his co-stars.\nIn fact, a lot more of the film is taken up with Rainsford and his fellow hunters alternately arguing and scheming among themselves, and then inevitably betraying one another, in order to win the dubious trophy of Malone\u2019s head, to be rendered as a hologram post-mortem. The competing middle-aged white guys with beards and barrel chests are a fairly interchangeable lot, although Nels Lennarson puts on the most florid display of psychopathology, piped through a cheerful Ulster accent. (Megan Peta Hill gets to be the lone female hunter.) Not even the section where Malone begins \u201ctripping balls\u201d thanks to some psilocybin-laced blackberries manages to spruce up this tedious genre exercise.\n Apex Predator is released on 12 November on digital platforms.",

        "content": "A new film looks at Arthur Ashe\u2019s US Open and Wimbledon triumphs. And how he responded to pressure to speak out on civil rights issues\nConfidence fueled Arthur Ashe\u2019s success in tennis. If he was confident enough, he said, he could hit the ball backwards. In 1968, he had plenty of forward momentum, going two months without losing a match. At that year\u2019s US Open, he defeated Tom Okker to become the first Black man to win a men\u2019s grand slam singles title. Meanwhile, Ashe had been facing both external and internal pressure to speak out on civil rights. After growing up in the segregated South, he had been concerned about a violent backlash. But after winning the US Open, he was ready to become more vocal, according to a new documentary, Citizen Ashe, directed by Rex Miller and Sam Pollard.\nIn the film, Ashe\u2019s brother Johnnie recalls his sibling saying, \u201cI\u2019m a champion now. People will listen to what I have to say. I\u2019m the first Black man to win the US Open. I\u2019m going to be sought out.\u201d\nMiller says Ashe\u2019s prediction soon became true. \u201cLiterally a few days after he won, he was on Meet the Press,\u201d he says. \u201cHe decided he finally could no longer stand on the sidelines \u2026 events in the spring and summer of 1968, Dr Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination, Robert F Kennedy\u2019s assassination, the Vietnam protests, the sit-ins, everything happening in the country, it was finally time for him to speak out.\u201d\nCitizen Ashe will be screened at the Doc NYC film festival on 13 November before a wider release in December. Incorporating rare audio footage and photos of the tennis star, the film shows Ashe\u2019s impact both on and off the court before his death at the age of 49 in 1993 from complications of Aids.\nThe film spotlights two of his grand slam wins at opposite ends of his career \u2013 at the US Open in 1968, and at Wimbledon seven years later, in 1975, when he stunned Jimmy Connors thanks to a gameplan devised on an envelope with a committee of friends. It also explores his activism, including in South Africa, where he challenged apartheid after learning that Nelson Mandela had been jailed for trying to vote. After his Aids diagnosis, he created a foundation dedicated to defeating the virus.\nThroughout, there are interviews with some of the individuals who were closest to him \u2013 including his widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, a producer on the film; and his brother, Johnnie.\n\u201c[The film] would not have happened if Jeanne was not on board,\u201d Miller says. \u201cShe was on board fully. She made a commitment to the film,\u201d helping him land conversations with players such as Charlie Pasarell (part of the committee that came up with the plan to beat Connors) and John McEnroe, who had a bend-but-don\u2019t-break relationship when Ashe mentored the US Davis Cup team.\n\u201cArthur, along with Jim Brown, Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], Bill Russell \u2026 was sort of a template for what many of today\u2019s [stars], Colin Kaepernick, Serena and Venus Williams, Naomi Osaka, LeBron James, follow,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing now is not in a vacuum.\u201d\nThat film looks at the formative moments of his early years in Richmond, Virginia. Ashe said that it was natural for Black children to question if they could ever thrive in a segregated society, and that any youngster with \u201cmore than a smattering of intelligence\u201d would leave. In Ashe\u2019s case, he did \u2013 first for St Louis to finish high school, and then for college at UCLA.\nRichmond had sad memories for Ashe \u2013 he lost his mother when he was six. His father was a caretaker of a segregated playground, where young Arthur learned to play tennis and where he was discovered by a coach named Dr Robert Johnson \u2013 who also noticed the promise of Black tennis pioneer Althea Gibson.\nThe film shows just how momentous 1968 was for both Ashe and the US, balancing multiple threads. Ashe\u2019s tennis career was taking off \u2013 he was the first Black man selected to the US Davis Cup team. He was also in the US military as a lieutenant stationed at West Point. His brother was serving too \u2013 in Vietnam. Johnnie Ashe volunteered for another tour of duty there so his brother would not have to go.\n\u201cIt was a major sacrifice,\u201d Pollard says. \u201cYou had to have a lot of love for your brother to do that.\u201d\nArthur Ashe did go on a USO tour to Vietnam in which he encountered live fire and saw injured service members, all of which affected him.\n\u201cIt sort of brought it home,\u201d Johnnie Ashe says in the film. \u201cI had done the right thing at the right time for the right reason.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Arthur Ashe was also wondering if the time was right to speak out on behalf of the civil rights movement. Black athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Brown were advocating on behalf of civil rights; Dr Harry Edwards called upon Ashe to do the same. But there were complicating factors.\n\u201cEspecially in the South, you did not want to make racial waves and put your life in danger,\u201d Pollard says. \u201cThere was a type of entrenched segregation in America on certain issues as a Black person, particularly in the South. He knew the rules of the game. If you wanted to survive in America, you did not make waves. You did the right thing. That was what it meant to be Black at the time.\u201d\nHowever, Pollard says that Ashe\u2019s \u201clevel of confidence was rising. He could speak up \u2013 not like Muhammad Ali or Bill Russell, he did it Arthur Ashe\u2019s way. Go back to what Harry Edwards says [in the film] \u2013 African American people are not monolithic, they do not do things the same way \u2026 [Ashe\u2019s activism had] just as powerful an impact.\u201d\nIn March, Ashe delivered a speech on civil rights at the Church of the Redeemer in Washington DC, which got some pushback from the military brass. In April, he was driving across the George Washington Bridge when he learned from the radio that King had been assassinated. During the presidential campaign, he talked tennis with Democratic candidate Robert F Kennedy \u2013 then, in June, Kennedy was also assassinated. A few months later, Ashe was US Open champion and ready to speak out for causes he championed, from civil rights to education to ending apartheid.\n\u201cHe was trying to change the playing field,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe was still a patriot. He was in the army and thought it was the right thing to do. He was proud of it, of his brother\u2019s service. All of these things coalesce in the moment when he won the US Open \u2013 the first Black champion, the first American champion of the [modern] US Open \u2026 It gave him a platform to speak out.\u201d",
