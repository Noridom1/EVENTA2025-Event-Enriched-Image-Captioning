        "content": "News agency, which has declined to use \u2018Gulf of America\u2019 name in stories, also barred from Air Force One\nThe White House has announced that it is indefinitely blocking Associated Press journalists from accessing the Oval Office and Air Force One amid a growing standoff between Donald Trump\u2019s administration and the news agency over the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name.\nThe White House deputy chief of staff, Taylor Budowich, made the announcement on X, saying: \u201cThe Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press\u2019s commitment to misinformation.\u201d\nBudowich went on to accuse the 175-year-old news wire agency \u2013 whose style guidance is used by thousands of journalists and writers globally \u2013 of \u201cirresponsible and dishonest reporting\u201d.\nBudowich said he recognized that the Associated Press\u2019s reporting was covered by the US constitution\u2019s first amendment, which provides for the freedoms of speech and press. But he maintained that \u201cdoes not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One\u201d.\nHe added that Associated Press journalists and photographers would retain their credentials to the White House complex.\nAccording to the Hill, an Associated Press journalist was barred from attending an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon following the White House\u2019s announcement.\nThe outlet reports that a White House official told the Associated Press journalist, \u201cNo, sorry,\u201d when the reporter tried to join the event.\nFriday\u2019s announcement from the White House marks an escalation in the growing feud between the Trump administration and the Associated Press over the organization\u2019s refusal to abide by Trump\u2019s preference for Gulf of America and change its style on that body of water to Gulf of America.\nOn Tuesday, the Associated Press said another one of its journalists was refused entry into an executive order signing ceremony at the Oval Office \u2013 a move described by the news agency\u2019s executive editor, Julie Pace, as an attempt by the White House to \u201cpunish\u201d the organization for its independent journalism.\n\u201cLimiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP\u2019s speech not only severely impedes the public\u2019s access to independent news, it plainly violates the first amendment,\u201d Pace said.\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s episode, Pace sent a letter to the White House, calling the White House\u2019s decision an \u201calarming precedent\u201d.\nA separate statement from the New York Times said it stood by the Associated Press while \u201ccondemning repeated acts of retribution by this administration for editorial decisions it disagrees with\u201d.\n\u201cAny move to limit access or impede reporters doing their jobs is at odds with the press freedoms enshrined in the constitution,\u201d said the statement, which was reported by chief CNN media analyst, Brian Stelter.\nAccording to a 23 January style memo, the Associated Press said that it would not be changing its style on the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America after Trump\u2019s decision to change the body of water\u2019s name \u2013 a move which holds authority only within the US\u2019s federal government.\n\u201cThe Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,\u201d the Associated Press said.\nBlocking the Associated Press\u2019s access around Trump could substantially affect news consumption in certain markets.\nThe Associated Press provides reporting to numerous publications across the US that do not have their own reporters covering the White House.\nSupporters of Trump could also use the White House\u2019s decision to limit access for Associated Press journalists as evidence for bad-faith arguments that the organization is unpatriotic or untrustworthy.",

        "content": "Pep Guardiola has pointed to Liverpool being unable to beat Manchester City\u2019s 100-point Premier League title triumph as an example of how many of his team\u2019s records may never be beaten.\nGuardiola led City to a record points total in 2017-18. That was the first of City\u2019s six championships under him, with last season\u2019s fourth in succession also a record achievement.\nGuardiola\u2019s side are now 16 points behind Liverpool, with injuries a major factor in City\u2019s uneven campaign. During Tuesday\u2019s 3-2 Champions League loss to Real Madrid, Jack Grealish and Manuel Akanji became the latest to suffer problems. While Grealish may recover from what is thought to be a muscle problem for Saturday\u2019s visit of Newcastle, Akanji is to undergo surgery on an abductor injury and will be out for up to 10 weeks.\nGuardiola said that due to the accumulation of game-time for players, numerous injuries are inevitable, which in his opinion makes City\u2019s supreme success under him more remarkable. \u201c[Even] with that [injuries], we took all the records in England. Nobody has done four Premier Leagues in a row,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you break your own record and say: \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 We have all the records \u2013 had 100 points in a season. I said many times to the players, when I analyse the last nine years, we\u2019ve had a really really bad three months. It\u2019s not bad, no? People are saying: \u2018What\u2019s happened Pep?\u2019 But what has happened in the past [under him]? That is not normal now, or in the past.\n\u201cWho would do 100 points now? I\u2019m waiting. Or four in a row, I\u2019m waiting. Have you seen Liverpool this season? They cannot do 100 points already, definitely cannot \u2013 99 but not 100.\u201d\nDespite the injuries, Guardiola will take his strongest possible squad to June\u2019s Club World Cup in the US. \u201cIt will be summer time there, we will go with the families, we will train when we have to train and prepare the games,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important for the club, financially and for the prestige. We will welcome people [youngsters] from the academy [too].\n\u201cAfter we\u2019ll see if I give extra time to some to arrive late [for pre-season] and maybe the first games of the Premier League or the first games of the season. We will see how they arrive [condition] and how many minutes some players play.\u201d\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nRegarding Akanji, Guardiola said: \u201cWe wish the best recovery for Manu because the effort he has done this season has been unbelievable.\u201d",

        "content": "US vice-president\u2019s speech and meeting with Germany\u2019s AfD chief signal administration\u2019s wider plans for continent\nThe Trump administration is making a big bet on Europe\u2019s hard right.\nSpeaking at a conference of Europe\u2019s leaders in Munich on Friday, the US vice-president JD Vance stunned the room by delivering what amounted to a campaign speech against Germany\u2019s sitting government just one week before an election in which the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim AfD is set to take second place.\nAs Vance accused foreign leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters\u2019 true beliefs, a whisper of \u201cJesus Christ\u201d and the squirming in chairs could be heard in an overflow room.\nHours later he met with Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD, breaking a taboo in German politics called the \u201cfirewall against the far-right\u201d, meant to kept the anti-immigrant party with ties to extremists out of the mainstream and of any ruling coalition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly controversial thing for him to do,\u201d said Kristine Berzina, the managing director of the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Geostrategy North, who was at the Munich Security Conference.\nThe backing of Vance \u2013 or Elon Musk, who recently gave a video address at an AfD party summit \u2013 is unlikely to tilt the result of Germany\u2019s elections, said Berzina. And it\u2019s unlikely to browbeat the ruling Christian Democratic Union, which should win next week\u2019s vote, into allowing AfD to enter any coalition.\nBut the US right under Trump does have its eyes set on a broader transformation in Europe: the rise of populist parties that share an anti-immigration and isolationist worldview and will join the US in its assault on globalism and liberal values. They see those leaders in Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, Giorgia Meloni in Italy, as well as the UK\u2019s Reform party and Marine Le Pen in France.\n\u201cIt is personal and it is political in terms of far-right political alignment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also opens the door to what other unprecedented things are we going to see in terms of the US hand in European politics.\u201d\nCould the US president even threaten serious policy shifts like tariffs based on an unsatisfactory German coalition? \u201cThat would be normally unthinkable,\u201d she said in response to that question. \u201cBut in 2025, very little is unthinkable.\u201d\nTrump has claimed a broad mandate despite winning the popular vote by a smaller margin than any US leader since the early 2000s. And he seeks to remake politics at home and redefine the US relationship with its allies abroad, many of whom attacked him personally in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and his second presidential campaign.\nVance also wanted to antagonise Europe\u2019s leaders on Friday. He refused to meet with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor who should be among the US\u2019 key partners in negotiations with Russia over the future of the war in Ukraine. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to see him, he won\u2019t be chancellor long,\u201d one former US official told Politico of the Vance team\u2019s approach.\nThat speaks to a trend in the Trump administration\u2019s thinking: that voters abroad will handle what his negotiations and alliances cannot. As Vance stunned the European elite on Friday, he told them that \u201cif you\u2019re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you\u201d.\n\u201cYou need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value in the coming years,\u201d he said.\nThis is something that Vladimir Putin, who waited years for the return of a Trump administration, knows well regarding his war in Ukraine: sometimes you have to bide your time until conditions are right.\nAnd it\u2019s something that Trump intimated about Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he riffed on his plan to end the war through negotiations that would cede Ukrainian territory and give up Kyiv\u2019s designs on Nato membership.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to do what he has to do,\u201d Trump said of Zelenskyy agreeing to a deal. \u201cBut, you know, his poll numbers aren\u2019t particularly great.\u201d",
